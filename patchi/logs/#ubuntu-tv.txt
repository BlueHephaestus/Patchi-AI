[12:32] <jussi> popey: you probably want to remove the VO from your flags, so you dont get auto opped everythime you join
[13:52] <willcooke> Hi folks!
[13:52] <willcooke> Thanks popey for setting this up for me
[13:58] <popey> np
[14:32]  * jussi bans willcooke :P 
[14:32] <willcooke> :(
[14:32] <jussi> nah, just kidding
[14:33] <jussi> willcooke: tell me how to tar a dir from the cli. Im tired and the man page is doing my head in
[14:33] <willcooke> tar -cvjf foo.tar.bz2 dir/*
[14:34] <jussi> thanks!
[14:35] <willcooke> :D
[14:35] <willcooke> caveat:  I haven't tested that
[14:35] <willcooke> it might not, and probably wont, work
[14:36] <willcooke> oh, an I assumed you want to compress it, which you might not want to.  "j" will create bz2 and "z" will create gz
[14:37] <jussi> it appears to have works, lets see how we go
