[00:14] <wgrant> ki7mt: No, a team must have an owner that isn't itself.
[00:14] <wgrant> (and you can't create cycles, eg. have two teams that own each other)
[00:28] <ki7mt> wgrant, Ok, thanks. Will need to look at that a bit more in depth.
[11:07] <mpt> As the admin of a team, is there any way to unsubscribe someone from the team’s mailing list? (They claim that they can’t do it)
[11:28] <wgrant> mpt: All you can do is remove them from the team.
[11:28] <wgrant> mpt: However, you should tell them they're wrong.
[11:29] <mpt> Launchpad says “You must log in to join or leave this team.”
[11:29] <wgrant> Then they should probably log in :)
[11:29] <mpt> Right, but they last used Launchpad years ago
[11:29] <mpt> They don’t remember their password
[11:29] <wgrant> They'll need to reset it, then.

[11:30] <wgrant> I speak of current reality, not fiction.
[11:31] <mpt> I know, I’m just pointing out this is a problem (just reported as bug 1455896)
[11:31] <ubot5> bug 1455896 in Launchpad itself "Can't unsubscribe from mailing list without logging in" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1455896
[11:34] <wgrant> However, I've always found it quite extraordinary that people expect to be able to unsubscribe without logging in when they had to log in to subscribe.
[11:34] <wgrant> Unauthenticated unsubscription is more than a little dodgy.
[11:37] <mpt> It’s a legal requirement in the US.
[11:37] <mpt> That you must not be required to log in to unsubscribe from anything.
[11:39] <wgrant> Hm?
[11:39] <wgrant> Have we determined that CAN-SPAM is applicable to mailing lists?
[11:44] <mpt> I don’t know. But most of the mailing lists that most people are subscribed to are commercial ones, so they’ll be used to that ease of unsubscription.
