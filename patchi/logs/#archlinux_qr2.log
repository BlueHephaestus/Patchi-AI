hi, i'm just installing archlinux to my lenovo e545 (with mkfs.btrfs /dev/sda so the whole disk is btrfs and then i install grub as stated on the wiki), everything runs fine, no errors or anything but when i try to boot it (with legacy mode, since no efi was used during install) it just won't find the bootloader... so it's probably a bios bug, right? :/ it works normally with for example fedora in efi mode...	why are you not using uefi?
what's archlinux?	tylerdurden01 why?

why do people use == ?	we should make emacs a wayland compositor
spartan-s63, "i want arch to interpret the hardware clock as local time" you mean timezone?	use utc and set the timezone
namarrgon, yeah familiar with vim, but found pacnews-git and installed it, running it shows nothing which means all my files are good ?	i think i'll wait ntil the live cd gets updated to 4.x as well

so, if i decide to learn the arch way, which guides would you recommend, aside from the wiki's beginners guide?	brandiee i wouldn't recommend that one.  also forget about "the arch way" before it rots your brain
so i'm encountering a strange problem with my arch install. i used the march 1 install disk and everything went perfectly smooth: i was able to use wifi-menu to generate a profile and succesfully connect to the internet. the rest of the install went flawlessly. however, once i booted into the actual installed os, my wireless adapter doesn't appear in /dev. it works perfectly fine on the livecd. did i miss something? i'm currently booted	into windows so it's not like i can run any diagnostics right this second.
is there an argument you can pass to grub that will prevent x from starting at boot? i think something happened to it that's making my system hang.	i learn this the day after i have the idea to put tmux in a vim window
kirito: would you like some cheese with your whine?	and same it goes for kf5 frameworks. they are marked as removal
i can reinstall anyway if i need right?	great now you scared me to leave my netbook 3 months without updates... d
so, what could be the problem ?	i don't think i've ever not had one not show up
say, if i add xynes repo, i.e. https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/unofficial_user_repositories#xyne-x86_64 then i shouldn't have to do any fiddling with keys, right?	title unofficial user repositories - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)

is it possible to have a bootable arch drive thats persistent with multiple video drivers?	yay found my bug

tried to upgrade linux and got this error during mkinitcpio: ==> error: '/lib/modules/3.19.3-3-arch' is not a valid kernel module director. is this an error on my side or arch?	namarrgon no just some people when someone ask a newbie like question just answer to go away and change distro... and i'm really tired with this kind of close mind thinking.

what does the pkgbuild say?	linux users are like jesus they turn windows into wine
soo many power saving options. what should i use? any recommendations? do i really have to wade through individual options?	scimmia no but that's because common ethics would suggest it is wrong.  common ethics do not currently have any effect on computer usage.  if everyone had best practices for the aur as common knowledge before using yaourt i'm sure you would see much less people editing the pkgbuild when given that option.  but these practices are *not* common knowledge and thus users do not know better.

i see that kde is split in the repositories as it should be, with the applications independent of the de. however, it looks like not everything is solved--kmix is for plasma 5 while kdemultimedia-kmix is for kde 4, however kdemultimedia-kmix is in kde-applications-meta. as a result, i can't install kde-applications-meta. is there a way around this? a kde-applications-meta solely for plasma 5?	dacoit. i have a driver for my touchpad (focaltech) the drivers install just fine but the device does not work as expected. the file name indicated that they were intended for kernel 3.19.0-rc4 i am on 3.19.3-3

how do i change which file manager that is the default in x.org? every time an application calls the default app for opening directories, it opens an mp3 tag software. i guess i have to find the proper mime for this, but where?	and calling it "mint-audio-cinnamon" or something?
why even discuss it?	tigrmesh well not entirely.  but i'm saying can you invoke godwin?

phutchins: you mean you have lvm hook and regenerated the image already?	tigrmesh can i try something else without rebooting and running a livecd?
like, want to uppercase a utf-8 string stored as a null terminated char*? good luck if you don't want to use glib!	demize i don't really think their claims have much basis anyway.  kernel context switching isn't great their need to support "legacy" in kdbus is silly (the kernel is the legacy forever you don't want to put badness into it before it has a chance)

sigh, i've never been happy with my terminal program. i've used termite for a while, but occasionally that breaks with updates. gnome-terminal is ok but i can't export the config to other computers. what's a decently simple (supported) terminal with an easy config? i guess i could always use xterm... although i'm mostly on wayland these days, does xterm even work there?	his quotes are boring
phrik: war42 is <reply>are we talking about game of thrones again?	huh fedora doesn't appear to have terminfo packages.

i am doing this because i had an issue with a public wifi dns today, where pinging ip directly worked but domain names didn't. after hardcoding `dns=8.8.8.8` under `/etc/resolv.conf`, my wifi worked, but i don't think this is a permanent solution. thus, i would like to use a more reliable dns like google's. any advice on changing my dns?	yeah stay off of it. something is bugged in the kernel it's self

how can i install plasma 5, then switch between it and gnome?	ausseh at your login dm
any idea why would i get no sound from headphones? i can see system switching to them, they seem to be unmuted, but no sound	so i am in the gnu grub settings

pandb: check about rt2800 in dmesg?	pandb maybe missing firmware
i read about switching between graphical cards. does it mean i have an internal graphical card, plus a nvidia one? (sorry for the dumb questions, that's a whole new world to me (	oh. looks like i have to learn the package manager heh.

chromebook? :s	yeah that's the other part it seems like a "it only happens once" kind of thing.

cpunltd: you uninstall 90% of the preinstall crap?	beest oh

yep. so what are my next steps?	alexoundos and?  it's not like i was saying that cleaning up your code fixes pulse.  my point is that by cleaning your code you make it less likely that you will run into problems with any software.  sure you'll still run into bugs that are in the software itself but you will not be running into as many problems caused by your own hand.
yeah, dan39?	yeah it's a shame
anyway ^? is not ctrl+backspace :(	there is vi-backward-kill-word
seemikehack, what sort of button correcting are you trying to do?	switchy should have specified that first the left and right click buttons occasioally operate like up and down arrows or page up and page down but not like left and right click buttons.

chais: what is the real question?	mrelendig journalctl reports "the wpa supplicant failed to start"
the font size in my terminals just changed after rebooting. fonts in skype have also changed size, but fonts in firefox are the same as before the reboot. what can cause this?	which packages were updated?

dacoit potmo:  i tried ocne but mu usb still wont boot. "now i read again the arch wiki and it says :assume your usb stick's first partition is fat32 and its partition is /dev/sdy1 ". i assume they are referring to my root partition, which is the second one, and it is labeled as ext4 partition, not fat32.. is there something wrong here?	case_of so an a version supported by an arch dev is out but some random stuff from the aur is ok? heh

tekken: sure which log should i pastebin? im pretty new	journalctl -b -1 > lastboot

any idea of why a loop device is being displayed ? and how can i remove ti ?	anyone have a sane ffmpeg template string to convert something to mp3?
fireboot: what's the permission/mask on xinit?	every*

did you enable developer mode?	vdv are you on x86_64?
arch_vader: you also need to remove gvfs. question, can udisks satisfy the gvfs need for udisks2?	ajacobsson 10 seconds is a bit short tough let's say the dictionary had 10^3 entries all the permutations are (10^3)^3 = 10^9 typical crack speeds using gpus are in the order of 10^4 trials/s so you merely tried 10^5 times vs a total set of 10^9 that's 0.01% of the total combinations you were mostly lucky iterating it all would've taken a whole day

hello. i'm new to arch because mint don't run on the latest macbook air. but as i expected, i ran into some problems. the most annoying thing is a switched key on the keyboard. i have fond some settings for xmodmap, but i'd like to change it for the console too. can somebody tell me how to translate the xmodmappings into some "global" mappings? i tried to set the mapping via /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/iso_layout but it has no effect.	well guys the gods of rebooting 50 times to solve something have forsaken me. i'm off to cry myself to sleep.

it's even possible?	smtp is only a protocol not the server itself. its possible.
huh thats weird? any idea why?	on boot.
afaik the reason for vmare modules not building is that the kernel was compiled with gcc 5.1. if it was compiled with 5.1, the kernel, shouldnt that gcc be upgraded as well so that we use it compile whatever we want?	i think that was a packager's mistake
i'm using xfce4, and for reasons i have yet to establish my volume intermittently resets to 100%. i'm using headphones without inline volume control, so this is quite jarring. any ideas what to check?	sdough pulseaudio or plain alsa?
