<darkelement>	hey guys where would i go to get logs of the top programming channels?
<nenica>	hi :)
<kindone>	darkelement, if they have public logging, should be in the channel's /topic or entrymsg
<darkelement>	know any big channels that do? i've looked through a few but nothing
<kindone>	i don't know of any
<ethoscience>	hi.
<rotcetorptekcop>	metanova, i think ping is disabled anyway, i am helping someone with experience in a few years ago
<`hypermist`>	hmm
<`hypermist`>	i can talk again
<aldem>	you can talk but i don't hear you.
<mystica555>	how would one find out the owner of a channel?
<ishanyx>	/msg chanserv info #channel
<mystica555>	so there's a rather abusive person in ##networking; the channel info is outdated and the url is dead, the founder is not online.. next steps?
<ser_berry>	 /msg chanserv ##networking list
<ser_berry>	see if other ops are available
<mystica555>	ah
<mystica555>	perhaps reverse the order; ##networking is an invalid command chimes chanserv ;)
<mystica555>	im not authorized
<mystica555>	yay
<ilbelkyr>	/msg chanserv access list ##networking
<ser_berry>	oops
<rotcetorptekcop>	metanova, in the email address you used if you open network connection connection has been happening since i know
<thomas>	looks like he might have stopped mystica555
<mystica555>	one can hope
<aldem>	hi thomas
<thomas>	hi hi
<aldem>	mystica555: did you have connexion problems earlier ?
<aldem>	##networking bans people for 24 hours i beleive if any
<mystica555>	no, im attempting to contact an op that might be able to restrain an abusive chatter
<chasedspade>	hey thomas, can i bug you about an i-line ticket again? :p
<thomas>	chasedspade: same one?
<chasedspade>	thomas: different one. #157735
<thomas>	alright
<skyroverr>	what's an i-line ticket?
<ser_berry>	skyroverr: i-lines handle things like concurrent connection limits for certain ip ranges. sometimes they need to be adjusted if there are a lot of people at a conference, for example
<skyroverr>	ser_berry: so it's all handled on the irc server or the client does that?
<ser_berry>	it's a server setting
<mekolat_>	can i get a cloak please?
<cyanoticaxolotl>	how do i get an affiliated cloak?
<cyanoticaxolotl>	i'm the maintainer of the i5 window manager project
<cyanoticaxolotl>	oh

<j4janicej>	http://users.skyside.tk/~janicez/2015-05-17-02-46-52.ogg
<joldy>	sounds good
<j4janicej>	joldy: :>
<paulski>	can someone hook me up with an unaffiliated cloak?
<joldy>	i am the only person in #scam, can i be an op there?
<joldy>	oh, i am.
<krakakanok>	xd joldy
<onionuser_a23>	verärgert über : ich frage mich weshalb man die offiziellen onion zugänge immer wieder dicht macht. obwohl man  onion user welche sich ohnehin über sasl authentifizieren ausdrücklich willkommen heisst !  ja klickt nur schnell auf den wohis button um die ip zu spammen
<computer-ass-hol>	hi fuckers
<computer-ass-hol>	i dont like you
<joldy>	sounds like a scam
<krakakanok>	xd
<joldy>	computer-ass-hol: whatever you're selling my answer is no
<denki>	hey, could i get a hostname cloak please?
<mjjf>	dear staff, thank you for providing me with an 'unaffiliated' cloak. i would like to know if i could get a cloak with a specific name (the name of my company).
<mrelendig>	mjjf: somewhat troublesome since group registration is still not working
<mjjf>	mrelendig: because of the gms?
<mjjf>	(somebody told me yesterday that it was down. i do not know what the acronym stands for)
<kindone>	gms == group management system
<mrelendig>	it has never been up
<mrelendig>	:p
<mjjf>	kindone: that's very kind of you.
<mjjf>	mrelendig: :(
<mrelendig>	short story: get permission from your boss to set up a group on freenode, then get a group cloak
<mjjf>	mrelendig: i am the ceo.
<mrelendig>	ask yourself then1
<mrelendig>	!
<blonddress>	i have lots of dresses and love how the look on me brushing on my stockings
<mrelendig>	just like in ck2
<mrelendig>	where you can have your chanselor improve relations with himself
<mrelendig>	:d
<asturcom>	hola alguien me ayuda
<mrelendig>	asturcom: english only
<asturcom>	where are ip play conquerors?
<blonddress>	i do love older men and would be a good girl for you
<rumpledelf>	blonddress: you might be on the wrong network
<mrelendig>	doesn't sound like something freenode related though
<asturcom>	help
<mrelendig>	asturcom: with what?
<blonddress>	o sorry i think i am
<asturcom>	ip for play the conquerors
<mrelendig>	what are "the conquerors"
<mrelendig>	and how is it related to freenode?
<asturcom>	???
<mrelendig>	are you talking about age of empire 2?
<asturcom>	conquerors is a game
<asturcom>	yes
<rumpledelf>	this is a free and open source software network, rather than a gaming network
<asturcom>	empires
<mrelendig>	asturcom: that is not related to freenode at all
<rumpledelf>	don't think freenode has many gaming channels
<mrelendig>	asturcom: try google if you want to find some game servers for it, or try some gaming forums
<asturcom>	thanks
<mjjf>	mrelendig: ofcourse i could allow myself anything i wish, but where do i register the group name? i thought i required to do so here.
<mrelendig>	mjjf: you can't really register it, you just have to talk to freenode staff to get them to set it up temporary until the grs is up
<mrelendig>	which will probably take another 10 years :p
<mrelendig>	or the thermal death of the universe
<mjjf>	lol! so, if i provide a staffmember with my company name i will be temporarily cloaked with that name, but without the ability to set it up for others, unless i request it for each of them individually. is that correct?
<equinoxdawg>	mjjf: https://freenode.net/group_registration.shtml read that.
<mjjf>	equinoxdawg: thanks. in that case, can i just have a single, named cloak? is that even possible without the gms?
<equinoxdawg>	mjjf: i'm not sure, to be honest. i know vanity cloaks aren't possible, so whether it comes under that or not: i'm not sure. sorry.
<mjjf>	equinoxdawg: it's for my company, while communicating with clients and collaborators (i'm a dev). i'm not sure vanity comes into play here.
<the>	what happened to tor official chatroom?
<nkuttler>	the: they are on oftc
<the>	oh, its been awhile lol
<the>	thx
<_2_chopi4453>	hi
<equinoxdawg>	hello

<v>	_2_chopi4453: spill the beans
<ludvig_>	ok, im from norrköping
<equinoxdawg>	v: people have tried before, and failed.
<flherne>	uk here
<v>	equinoxdawg: i'm just asking, that's all
<v>	equinoxdawg: i'm fine with a no, but i wouldn't know until i asked
<equinoxdawg>	v: that's completely fine, just know staff haven't been around recently, so it's probably going to be quite a wait.
<_2_chopi4453>	okay but don't be so rude
<v>	equinoxdawg: i'm always logged in, so not a problem
<_2_chopi4453>	creep
<v>	_2_chopi4453: who?
<flherne>	v: you, obviously
<v>	why?
<_2_chopi4453>	i am only joking
<v>	my tmux shell is creepy i guess

<circ-user-re5sx>	hi
<circ-user-re5sx>	i am not able to join the django channel for some reason :/
<ser_berry>	circ-user-re5sx: did you try again after initially connecting?
<ser_berry>	this channel requires that you are identified to join
<circ-user-re5sx>	yeah did again..
<circ-user-re5sx>	first i had to resgister myself with nickserver and after i got the confirmation... it just says 'cannot send to channel'
<dtscode>	circ-user-re5sx: you need to login to nickserv
<circ-user-re5sx>	oh
<jashank_>	hello!  i've got a peculiar situation: i've lost my password, and my old vps, which i no longer have access to, is still running my irc bouncer, so i can't /ns sendpass.
<jashank_>	may i request assistance in manually recovering my nickserv password?
<ser_berry>	is there any way you can prove you own that account?
<circ-user-re5sx>	okay... this is a noob question... but whats the command to login to nickserv?
<jashank_>	ser_berry: i still have access to the email account associated with it.
<ser_berry>	circ-user-re5sx: /msg nickserv identify
<circ-user-re5sx>	thanks
<ser_berry>	jashank_: ah, perhaps a staff member can force a forgotten password request
<colbyftp>	hi, can i get an unaffiliated cloak
<v4e>	how do u play and join
<mrelendig>	v4e: you just lost the game
<sorlag>	what time of day do the staffers come on?
<ibrar>	hmm okay i did the nickserv identify thing.. and its says im now logged in.. but still cant send any messages to #django
<dtscode>	maybe they quieted you?
<ibrar>	maybe, but its the first time ive joined the channel.... and just tried to send initial 'hi' for a few times. but it said cant send..
<nighttrain>	no, you're not logged in.
<nighttrain>	(not from this connection)
<nighttrain>	err, yes you are.
<dtscode>	i was going to say... my laptop thinks he is.
<dtscode>	sorry ibrar i have no other ideas.
<nighttrain>	sorry, yeah, he is logged in.
<ibrar>	okies.
<maxburgiv>	ho-ly cow
<maxburgiv>	so many users
<usr_>	who can help with file encryption?
<teward>	usr_: depends on the goals, and the os you're using, so maybe you need to start in a channel specific for your os
<flherne>	maxburgiv: as usual for irc, most people idle most of the time in most channels ;-)
<maxburgiv>	that's true
<maxburgiv>	a lot of times i just log into a channel and go afk for an eternity
<cxki>	good morning! may i please have an unaffiliated vhost please, thanks :)
<john8>	hi
<john8>	can anyone see this message
<grawity>	nope

<john8>	is there any iphone or random chat room here..
<john8>	because i need to talk to someone about my iphone...
<john8>	grawity what do you think about it ?
<valentinovd__>	http://valentinovd.github.io yes you can translate words :d
<john8>	huh?
<john8>	hmm
<flherne>	john8: there are ##iphone, #iphonedev and ##apple
