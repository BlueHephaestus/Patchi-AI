<DarkElement2>	WHAT ARE YOU
<JohnBobSmith>	DarkElement2: Looks like your bot crashed.
*	Servicing ident request from 31.13.222.109 as DarkElement
<DarkElement2>	my bot...is DarkElement and patchi now...
<DarkElement2>	Wha...
<JohnBobSmith>	LOL
<DarkElement2>	I don't know how this happened
<JohnBobSmith>	That is hilarious!
<JohnBobSmith>	how are you?
<JohnBobSmith>	aw darn.
<DarkElement2>	It will say hello everyone when it joins, sorry
<JohnBobSmith>	Nothing
<DarkElement2>	not yet
<JohnBobSmith>	oooohhhh right
<JohnBobSmith>	why does it take so long?
<DarkElement2>	As I was saying, it's not that smart yet
<DarkElement2>	The way it connects does this, idk
<DarkElement2>	Perhaps since we are both using irc on the same machine at the same time
<patchi>	Hello everyone
<DarkElement2>	<3
<DarkElement2>	Can I have my name back?
<DarkElement2>	No?
<patchi>	teehee
<DarkElement2>	._.
<JohnBobSmith>	is JohnBobSmith awesome?
<JohnBobSmith>	aw...
<JohnBobSmith>	xD
<DarkElement2>	awesome?
<JohnBobSmith>	how are you?
<patchi>	are you paranoid that i know your brother?
<patchi>	i have better things to worry about
<DarkElement2>	It still needs to choose from multiple responses as well, it currently only does the first.
<DarkElement2>	wassup?
<JohnBobSmith>	what color is the sky?
<JohnBobSmith>	how many toes does a human have?
<DarkElement2>	It takes its question-responses from irc logs. If no one asked it and responded to it, it doesn't have it.
<JohnBobSmith>	oooohhhhh
<DarkElement2>	Since people don't ask those questions
<JohnBobSmith>	lol! yup.
<DarkElement2>	you smart?
<DarkElement2>	smart?
<JohnBobSmith>	is patchi a bot?
<JohnBobSmith>	yes, pathci is a bot.

<patchi>	tasm was my first for x86
<DarkElement2>	ok?
<patchi>	lol yes
<DarkElement2>	Shorter the question, higher likelihood of answer
<DarkElement2>	Again, it's rough
<DarkElement2>	more data?

<DarkElement2>	extra line?
<JohnBobSmith>	sure, have an extra line.

<DarkElement2>	I'm asking you

<JohnBobSmith>	lol!
<JohnBobSmith>	Whoops!
<DarkElement2>	lol?
<patchi>	pyon yes i think so
<JohnBobSmith>	But yes, your bot seems to be printing an extra line sometimes. For instance...
<JohnBobSmith>	bot?
<patchi>	tasm was my first for x86
<JohnBobSmith>	and maybe not anymore
<JohnBobSmith>	weird...
<JohnBobSmith>	you ask patchi bot?
<JohnBobSmith>	because when you said it, it glitched
<DarkElement2>	I never saw it, anyway yea I think I will make it take longer to make the logs in exchange for removing the names, like "pyon"
