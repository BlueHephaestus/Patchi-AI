<nigelb> yofel: thanks for correcting
<nigelb> oh, good, we're now logged :)
<nhandler> yep. "logs will start to show up not more than one hour after someone speaks in the channel": http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2010/03/25/%23ubuntu-reviews.html
<dholbach> good morning
<akos> hi dholbach
<dholbach> hi akos
<yofel> morning
<yofel> dholbach: reading the wiki page nigelb was working on yesterday the only requirenment to join atm is being part of bug control?
<dholbach> yofel: persia can maybe answer that
<yofel> ok, thx
<persia> i'm not any better qualified to answer than anyone else.  i'd rather say that not being a member of bug control indicates one cannot join the team, but i don't know of positive requirements.
<yofel> any team meeting planned yet to discuss this?
<persia> ask nigelb or nhandler
<dholbach> or bdmurray
<persia> yeah.
<persia> my personal sense is that the team is not that formal yet, so mostly anyone who wants to join can join, assuming that other folks think they have the qualifications.
<persia> most of the new members i've seen have come because some member ha s asked an admin "hey, can you add <nick> to the team?"
<yofel> mind if i apply then? i'm interested.
<persia> i don't have any objections, but i'm not even a very active member of the team (i've maybe reviewed 30 patches in the past few weeks).
<nigelb> i'm going through the process of creating a knowledge base for the reviewers team.  let me know if there is something specific that needs to be there
<nigelb> nhandler: around to bounce some ideas off?
<nigelb> i fail at writing wikis
<nhandler> nigelb: sort of (if it is really fast). if not, send me an email and i'll reply later today
<nigelb> nhandler: carry on then.  i'll just keep writing and you can review later :)
<nhandler> :)
<yofel> hey, i asked in the morning already? what are the requirenments to joing atm? anything else from the wiki page? i would be interested
<yofel> s/already?/already/
<nigelb> yofel: you can apply and ask d_holbach to approve
<yofel> today's my typo day, meh...
<yofel> that's true too
<yofel> anyway, should bug 546220 be synced from debian with an ffe, or should the lucid package be patched?
<ubot3> malone bug 546220 in nginx "include geoip support in nginx" [wishlist,triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/546220
<yofel> not synced but merged
<ibuclaw> yofel, thanks for reminding me :)
<nigel_nb> yofel: we have far too less devs here, ask in -motu?
<yofel> will do
<ibuclaw> does lucid still allow login as root via gdm?
<nigelb> dholbach: ping
<dholbach> nigelb: pong
<nigelb> what would be the process for new member to join reviewers?
<nigelb> writing new wiki pages
<nigelb> dholbach: ^ (i've currently put as ping you here)
<dholbach> i have no idea
<nigelb> no n
<dholbach> maybe we should talk to bdmurray and other ubuntu qa people
<nigelb> ah
<dholbach> who have experience with the bug control thing
<dholbach> and judge membership
<dholbach> i dunno if we should make it open and free for all
<nigelb> requirements are currently members of bug control
<nigelb> but my question is, how should they apply and get accepted
<nigelb> pinging you would be fine?
<dholbach> no
<dholbach> they can just apply in lp
<dholbach> and any of the team admins can accept
<nigelb> aha, okay :)
<dholbach> i'm busy enough as it is right now and wouldn't want to be a blocker :)
<nigelb> hehe
<nigelb> dholbach: thoughts on having a "patch day" where we get all the reviewers together to work on bugs with patches attached?  thinking of having something after lucid release when a large part of motu would be free for some time.
<dholbach> definitely
<dholbach> maybe part of ubuntu open week
<dholbach> to have a session there to explain everything
<dholbach> and then do a patch day afterwards
<nigelb> +1 for that
<nigelb> i was thinking of doing a standalone session this week some time
<nigelb> s/week/month
<dholbach> sure
<dholbach> might be worth talking to http://launchpad.net/~packaging-training-coordinators
<nigelb> sure, i'll talk to nhandler :)
<nigelb> before that, are you okay with the workflow now?
<dholbach> i think we can improve it incrementally, my gut feeling is that we have too many tags
<dholbach> and that those tags don't equate to tasks that we can ask people to perform
<nigelb> got time?
<dholbach> no, unfortunately not
<nigelb> i can get you the use case for them
<dholbach> i think we can roll with it now
<dholbach> and revisit after lucid
<nigelb> we'll roll and improvise later?
<dholbach> that gives us some experience with how it works now
<nigelb> i'm getting this in shape now https://wiki.ubuntu.com/reviewersteam
<dholbach> i'm sorry, but i'm maxed out right now
<dholbach> thanks a bunch for looking into this
<nigelb> i'll work on a class later this month and patch day after lucid release
<nigelb> no problem.  happy to help :)
<dholbach> awesome!
<ibuclaw> quick question, does lucid still allow login as root via gdm?
<nigelb> no clue. :(
<ibuclaw> i'm not near a machine atm
<ibuclaw> well... a lucid machine
<ibuclaw> nigelb, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gdm/+bug/484317
<ubot3> malone bug 484317 in gdm "gdm allows root logins" [medium,triaged]
<nigelb> i'm still running karmic, so i can't test either
<ibuclaw> a bug i raised a while back w/ patch attached
<nigelb> hold on, lemme ask someone who might know
<ibuclaw> i've just updated the tags (some were irrelevant)
<nigelb> good news folks, the number of patches down has gone up from 6636 to 6697 :)
<nigelb> sorry, about the /topic spam, made a mistake earlier, corrected now :)
<iulian> so people who do not have access can still change the topic.
<nhandler> iulian: any ubuntu member can change the topic: /msg chanserv help topic
<nigelb> iulian: all ubuntu members can change the topic :)
<nigelb> persia: byrce did some editing on the wiki to have https://wiki.ubuntu.com/reviewersteam/gettinginvolved
<nigelb> a bit of copy editing and now it looks pretty good :)
<persia> i saw that earlier.  it's much nicer now.
<persia> although the "repeat step 3" doesn't make sense anymore :)
<nigelb> ah, lemme see what it was supposed to do :)
<nigelb> so, everyone is +1 for a patch day (bryce and bdmurray), and we might actually have it :)
<nigelb> i need to work on finishing the wiki pages by then
<nigelb> anything more you'd like me to add?
<nigelb> persia: which is the page that gives information about making simple patches?
