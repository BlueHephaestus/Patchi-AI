<ser_berry>	skyroveRR: i-lines handle things like concurrent connection limits for certain IP ranges. sometimes they need to be adjusted if there are a lot of people at a conference, for example

<asturcom>	where are ip play conquerors?
<blonddress>	i do love older men and would be a good girl for you
*	MrElendig tries to make any sense of that and fails
<RumpledElf>	blonddress: you might be on the wrong network
<MrElendig>	doesn't sound like something freenode related though
<asturcom>	help
<MrElendig>	asturcom: with what?
<blonddress>	o sorry i think i am
<asturcom>	ip for play the conquerors
<MrElendig>	what are "the conquerors"
<MrElendig>	and how is it related to freenode?
<asturcom>	???
<MrElendig>	are you talking about age of empire 2?
<asturcom>	conquerors is a game
<asturcom>	yes
<RumpledElf>	this is a free and open source software network, rather than a gaming network
<asturcom>	empires
<MrElendig>	asturcom: that is not related to freenode at all
<RumpledElf>	don't think freenode has many gaming channels
<MrElendig>	asturcom: try google if you want to find some game servers for it, or try some gaming forums
<asturcom>	thanks
<mjjf>	MrElendig: ofcourse I could allow myself anything I wish, but where do I register the group name? I thought I required to do so here.
<MrElendig>	mjjf: you can't really register it, you just have to talk to freenode staff to get them to set it up temporary until the grs is up
<MrElendig>	which will probably take another 10 years :p
<MrElendig>	or the thermal death of the universe
<mjjf>	lol! so, if I provide a staffmember with my company name I will be temporarily cloaked with that name, but without the ability to set it up for others, unless I request it for each of them individually. Is that correct?
<Equinoxdawg>	mjjf: https://freenode.net/group_registration.shtml read that.
<mjjf>	Equinoxdawg: thanks. In that case, can I just have a single, named cloak? is that even possible without the GMS?
<Equinoxdawg>	mjjf: I'm not sure, to be honest. I know vanity cloaks aren't possible, so whether it comes under that or not: I'm not sure. Sorry.
<mjjf>	Equinoxdawg: It's for my company, while communicating with clients and collaborators (I'm a dev). I'm not sure vanity comes into play here.
