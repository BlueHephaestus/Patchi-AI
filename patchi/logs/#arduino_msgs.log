<darkelement>	hey guys how do i send the output of a program(.py/.js/.etc) to the serial port/lcd on the arduino? i just want to use live output of a program on the arduino by sending it
<deshipu>	darkelement: which part is giving you trouble?
<darkelement>	deshipu: i am unsure how to (1) send output to the arduino and then (2) use the stream of output in the code
<deshipu>	darkelement: your language should have a serial library. for instance, pyserial for python
<deshipu>	darkelement: how to actually display the stings on the lcd depends on the lcd you use, but there should be plenty of examples
<darkelement>	nice, python makes it easier
<darkelement>	ok, awesome
<darkelement>	i'll come back if i find some questions, but ty
<d3jake>	a 10k pot was used in most 1602 lcd tutorials, right? could i use it to vary the voltage to a 12v windshield wiper motor?
<d3jake>	i mean, you can't overload it, or something, right?
<theseven>	btw, i ordered some of these dirt cheap nrf modules, and got them today: http://www.aliexpress.com/item//674686536.html
<theseven>	i kinda expected to get some crap, and the pcb is shoddy for sure (they didn't even bother to put any silkscreen on it)
<theseven>	however all the usual components are populated, and the modules appear to be working fine
<theseven>	looking at the registers they seem like authentic nrf chips, and they are compatible (spi and radio) with my other (likely authentic) nrf modules
<d3jake>	wow... 10 pcs...
<theseven>	chisight: ^
<d3jake>	eww....
<chisight>	wow, pretty good.  68cents @10 is great.
<chisight>	looks like the lowest on ebay is 75 cents and is those cob ones.  lowest that looks like a chip are 84 cents.
<chisight>	theseven, glad to see the pricing coming down. :-)
<poppavic>	xark:  since my 'nightly' dl last week was actually 1.6.4, lord knows wtf that means ;-)
<nvidhive>	i won't touch the ftdi stuff due to using the edison.. now that it works.. i placed a huge "do not disturb" sign all over it
<xark>	nvidhive: it was an optional update, i "declined". :)
<poppavic>	my ftdi module works fine - folks are weird.
<xark>	poppavic: it means you might have 1.6.4, or a bugfix or two away. :)
<nvidhive>	poppavic: the edison has 3 drivers that is uses and depending on prior com settings, it can act very "wonky"
<nvidhive>	wonky is a technical term
<poppavic>	xark:  well, it reports 1.6.4 if asked, otherwise "nightly", and it just works.
<xark>	poppavic: okay, just understand it may not be "real" 1.6.4
<poppavic>	nvidhive:  i know from wonky and tech-terms - like fubar, snafu, bd, and omfgwtf
<poppavic>	xark:  i doubt "arduino" knows from "real" anymore - they can renumber it randomly ;-)
<xark>	real = not different from what other 1.6.4 users have. :)
<nvidhive>	don't forget "idunno" and "itwaslikethatwhenifoundit"
<poppavic>	nvidhive:  nih
<circumspector>	i think something's wrong with my minis. 9v input on the raw started smoking the regulator (?). works fine on 5v through usb though, i just gotta figure out how to step down the 9v from the pump power supply so i can run both off one adaptor instead of plugging in two wall warts...
<ozzzy>	i use a small lm317 circuit on raw on my minis
<ozzzy>	i feed them 6.7-6.9v
<emiliano>	hello everybody!
<blathijs>	circumspector: anything powered from the vcc line other than the pro mini itself that might be causing overcurrent?
<blathijs>	hi, emiliano
<emiliano>	could anybody give me a hand?
<circumspector>	mini toggles a relay and runs a moisture sensor, though not consecutively
<blathijs>	emiliano: only if you ask your real question first :-p
<emiliano>	lol
<circumspector>	man, there's almost too many options out there for components. "oh, you need a mosfet? which of the 6k options do you need?" argh! thank god for google
<emiliano>	i'm receiving an udp packet from the network (which i send from a c# app) and i cannot convert the char array i get as a result to an int
<emiliano>	i don't get it
<blathijs>	circumspector: relay could pull quite some current. any idea about the coil's current specs?
<xxvaliumxx>	does anyone have an idea about what i could use to replace the top wire in a pair of beats pro headphones?  it's a 3 conductor enameled deal.
<xxvaliumxx>	but incredibly skinny
<xxvaliumxx>	i'm at the point where i'm going to try braiding usb conductor.
<circumspector>	looks like coil is in the 20~ma range
<blathijs>	emiliano: are you sending the integer as a string, using ascii characters for each digit? or are you sending the number as a raw binary?
<emiliano>	yes
<emiliano>	as a string
<blathijs>	emiliano: then you need to "parse" the string back to an integer
<blathijs>	emiliano: if the udp packet is read from a stream (not sure how the ethernet library does this), you could use the parseint method perhaps? http://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/parseint
<blathijs>	emiliano: otherwise, using the string class could be useful: http://www.arduino.cc/en/tutorial/stringtointexample
<emiliano>	this is what happens
<emiliano>	if i try to convert the char array to string like this string somestring = string(thechararray); the value for somestring is "s"
<emiliano>	i don't know why
<emiliano>	if, instead, i go through the char array inside a for and i assign each char individually the string works
<xxvaliumxx>	field stripping.  am i doing this right? http://puu.sh/hfpjd.jpg
<poutine>	what's the point of this project?
<xxvaliumxx>	the wire that connects the left side to the right is broken
<zapduino>	if dr dre saw this he would tears
<blathijs>	emiliano: then i wonder how you are filling that thechararray
<xxvaliumxx>	thats the other point
<xxvaliumxx>	zapduino i don't even like beats
<blathijs>	emiliano: but i'm off to bed, so hopefully others can help you out
<zapduino>	xxvaliumxx: they are not too bad
<zapduino>	fancy headphones
<xxvaliumxx>	comfy
<xxvaliumxx>	i will say this, i got them second hand, and i know they are fake
<xxvaliumxx>	that said, the drivers, being not actual beats/monster drivers, actually sound better than the real thing, to me.
<pwillard>	if an onboard regulator has no heatsink... and the input voltage is high, there is much less current available until it heats up to the point of shutdown than may be indicated by the datsheet.  (which is why feeding the regulator a voltage closer to the drop out voltage allows more current to be supplid... and why the uno says max 12v on the dc jack, and not 35v like the regulator chip allows)
<circumspector>	what's the simplest solution to audio playback? i'm just looking to essentially "press button/trigger code > plays audio file." mp3 shields and related boards are either expensive and/or have unnecessary features
<chisight>	circumspector, got lots o pins open?  if yes, look at a ladder dac.  also called r2r.
<zapduino>	pcm playback using resistor network
<circumspector>	hah, ok, is there something a little less simple than that? :p
<chisight>	simpler than resistors?
<circumspector>	*less* simple?
<chisight>	oh
<chisight>	would help if i read it.
<chisight>	lots of i2c and spi dacs out there.  many with dual channels.
<xxvaliumxx>	so, i have choices to make.
<xxvaliumxx>	one of them is wether or not to actually restore original function, and make it so i can plug in on either side.
<xxvaliumxx>	or i pick a side, and they still work, but only if you plug them in on that side
<zapduino>	annoying options
<xxvaliumxx>	i don't feel like wideningthe channels, so i'm going to do the one side option.
<xxvaliumxx>	the left, if anyone cares.
<zapduino>	so only one side works?
<xxvaliumxx>	both sides will work
<xxvaliumxx>	just not both jacks
<xxvaliumxx>	they have a jack on either side so you can choose what side to plug the cable in on
<zapduino>	ah
<xxvaliumxx>	might replace the drivers too.
<zapduino>	the speakers?
<xxvaliumxx>	yeah
<zapduino>	you sure thats a knock off set?
<xxvaliumxx>	100%
<xxvaliumxx>	they are copies of the drake ovo single release
<chisight>	did anyone get the new pi yet?  worth it?  have old ones already.
<zapduino>	ah cool
<ozzzy>	chisight, the new one is a bit quicker than the old ones
<chisight>	ozzzy, have you played with one yet?
<ozzzy>	yes
<chisight>	any compatibility issues or challenges compared to the old ones?
<ozzzy>	nope
<chisight>	is it good enough to run a mainstream browser on?
<ozzzy>	nope
<ozzzy>	you can run one... but it'll be slower than the 2nd coming
<chisight>	i think that's my real problem with the old ones.
<ozzzy>	and it'll be your problem with the new one
<chisight>	so probably not very useful.  i use vnc to resolve it for the most part but it doesn't resolve when the neighbor girl  comes over and wants to watch a movie preview on the big screen where the pi is at.
<chisight>	x over the net doesn't either unfortunately.
<ozzzy>	it'll run xbmc nicely and let you watch movies/tv shows
<chisight>	never got into xbmc, my only pass at it was fine for playing things but the menus were dog slow to the point of unusable.
<chisight>	so raspbian and omxplayer is what i use for playing.
<ozzzy>	the new versions are quite zippy
<chisight>	is it safe assume you can install new versions right inside raspbian rather than having to use an xbmc specific distro?
<ozzzy>	i would use the specific distro
<chisight>	ok.  that's what i did on my one pass at it.  kinda sucky to lose the pi as a pi only to have it a media machine.
<arduino787>	hi
<arduino787>	what an eequivilent for a p2n2222ag transistor?
<zapduino>	\o
<arduino787>	halp plz
<timemage>	arduino787, in what sense?
<xxvaliumxx>	okay zapduino, your opinion please;  originally these are supposed to fold up.  the end stops are broken so if you twist it too far it shears the wire.
<xxvaliumxx>	should i make them fixed?
<zapduino>	yeah
<xxvaliumxx>	that settles it then.
<xxvaliumxx>	impact driver
<zapduino>	make it fully functional
<zapduino>	or else i don't want them
<chisight>	upgrading to 1.6.4 was easy :-)
<xark>	chisight: yep.  no issues here (and compile text is easier to read now - was so dim).
<chisight>	xark, looks the same here.  i had 1.6.0 though, so maybe it was different.
<xark>	i believe they notched up the orange a bit.  also highlights error in window.
<chisight>	oh, sweet.  hadn't made any errors yet.  hehehe
<xark>	"* restored previous "error" colour in black lower part of the ide"
<chisight>	lol, our friend  int atexit(void (*func)()) { return 0; } is back...  turning on all compiler warnings gets one from that.
<xark>	chisight: yes, i've been seeing that for a while with warnings "hack" on.   all those look trivial to fix...
<xark>	maybe i'll post a small patch on mailing list...
<chisight>	that would be nice.
<xark>	(void)func;     would fix that one cleanly.
<chisight>	lost as to what they're trying to accomplish with that line.
<chisight>	it did remind me that i hard coded something in a library file because i had a bug...  need to go back and fix that.
<xark>	chisight: which line?  the atexit?
<xark>	now core has zero warnings on "all" setting...
<chisight>	no, elsewhere in my code.
<chisight>	it's the reason i like -wall on.  it reminds me when i've done something stupid.
<xark>	totally.  imho it is not a "help" (to newbies or anyone) to silence c++ warnings.  c++ warns for things that would generally be a fatal error in most languages. :)
<chisight>	exactly.  in agree entirely.
<chisight>	though both the core atexit warning and my bug were "unused parameter" errors and that's not even reported in many languages.
<xark>	yeah, these warnings certainly aren't critical (but last few ide revs have all warnings suppressed).
<chisight>	:-(  bad.
<xark>	chisight: they only did that because toolchain had a bug issuing a "bogus" warning (but i think the cure was worse than the problem). :)
<chisight>	depending on just what it is, disabling it in the specific lib or at the actual line in the code is ok as long as they're sure the code is actually ok.
<xark>	perhaps, if it can't trivially be fixed.  the warning in question could not be fixed or suppressed (short of suppressing all).
<xark>	something to do with interrupt vector naming...
<chisight>	i'll have to take your word for it, i don't know the situation but have always found gcc to be pretty capable when it comes to suppressing individual warnings when i've needed to.
<xark>	chisight: yes, again this was a toolchain bug (linker) and no way to suppress (i looked too). :)
<chisight>	ok.  i didn't look and take your word on it.
<chisight>	bug resolved, now off to correctly implement zerocopy.
<d3jake>	o/ all
<d3jake>	i finally have a car with odb ii!
<d3jake>	its transmission doesn't do anything useful... but otherwise cool
<flea86>	d3jake congrats!
<d3jake>	yeap
<nashi>	anyone happen to know of an irc app/sketch for arduino?
<xark>	hmm...
<chisight>	nashi, someone was here the other night.
<chisight>	looking at logs...
<nashi>	thanks
<xark>	http://snipplr.com/view/47435/arduino-irc-idler/
<d3jake>	run a pi with an irc client on it.
<nashi>	whoa thanks xark
<nashi>	d3jake: that would defeat the purpose.
<xark>	thank google. :)
<nashi>	i tried but failed to find that before coming here.
<nashi>	so, no, it's you i thank!
<nashi>	whoa
<nashi>	thankyou!
<nashi>	i wanna with wireless, but... awesome!
<xark>	i wish i had more than a pic.
<nashi>	i wanna use that screen basically but landscape.... ive got my work cut out for me, this is my first arduino project. its something i really want.
<chisight>	mike____, is idling in here now.  he's the one who did the project in the picture.
<nashi>	yah i see that. i hope he's got a few pointers for me if he is here.
<chisight>	nashi, please be aware that this channel and most others frown on experimental code running in the channel.  there are test channels for that though.
<nashi>	i wouldnt run it here, chisight
<chisight>	:-)
<nashi>	i would build it into a working irc client and then begin using it here. :)
<chillum>	for an irc idler i would use an esp8266
<nashi>	not idler, actual client.
<chillum>	that too
<d3jake>	sounds like a fun project, though it sounds like it'll be cumbersome to do on an arduino. sounds like a fun project.
<nashi>	im going to use esp8266+arduino.
<chillum>	the arduino for display?
<nashi>	the esp8266 will in the end once ive learned how to program it do the heavy lifting...and...yes
<chillum>	ya, it is annoying that while the esp can in theory run all kinds of devices there is a real lack of modules
<nashi>	arduino will do the non network stuff, and esp8266 the network stuff
<irseeyou>	kline: hai :d
<chillum>	i assume in time this will be fixed
<chillum>	i am currently using an atmega328 for the sole purpose of writing to a sd card in a project with an esp that would otherwise not need another mcu
<chillum>	thankfully it is only a software problem
<chisight>	yeah, i have back to back nanos in my project because of software problems.  happens.
<chillum>	at least they are cheap
<d3jake>	out for sleep. night folks.
<chillum>	i am going to try to downgrade to a atmega8 for the sd writing if it works. but i will get it working right first then try that
<chillum>	night
<chisight>	yeah.  and it will be resolved but it's at least usable with a pair.  didn't write 1/2 of it.
<chisight>	night
<nashi>	those little atmega8 are cheap!
<xark>	like an attiny with a lot more pins. :)
<chisight>	yeah.  was thinking they'd make good i/o expanders since they're so cheap but the pcf8574 lets you expand 8 i/o at a time for 57 cents each.
<xark>	gpior1-3*
<chillum>	nashi: i know, i keep trying to think of uses for those little atmega8s
<nashi>	then again the 328p isnt so expensive either... http://www.ebay.com/itm/10pcs-new-atmega328p-pu-microcontrolle-r-avr-32k-flash-8-dip-28-good-/181561939097?pt=lh_defaultdomain_0&hash=item2a45ef5499
<nashi>	omglol i think i should go to bed xark at first i thought you penciled smiley faces onto the led surfaces..... from that pic
<xark>	wow...perhaps. :)
<xark>	uh-oh...now i see them. :)
<nashi>	xd i know, right?
<xark>	they are winking at us...
<nashi>	rofl
<nashi>	grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr a 58gb file i was getting off the net is now corrupt because seagate. #$%&$^#%#$%
<chillum>	i am so happy that the technology that rocked the 80s is now cheap, powerful and easy to use
<chillum>	it is about time
<nashi>	chillum: a little more than that.... there's now a $9 1ghz computer on pcb with wifi n bluetooth and composite and 512mb ram with 4gb flash that runs linux....
<nashi>	so its more like the 90s.
<nashi>	90s, in cheap
<chillum>	what is that called?
<chillum>	$9 is getting up there in price, but if you need power hardware...
<chillum>	operating systems are a bit overrated
<xark>	i assume https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598272670/chip-the-worlds-first-9-computer
<hawku>	that cost more than raspberry pi for me
<xark>	yeah.  also not slated to ship until may of next year...
<hawku>	$9 computer + hdmi == ~50 eur
<xark>	i would rather use an rpi2 (quad core and 2x the ram).
<xark>	looks very lo-res in the photos too (even with vga and hdmi shown).
<larsemil>	does anyone know how to build for the due using inotool?
<chillum>	ahh kickstarter, a great place to find innovative things you cannot buy
<karlmag>	heh
<chillum>	xark: i use a rpi2 and it does great, plays 1080p no problem. even the rpi1 does, but the menus are a bit slow
<xark>	chillum: yes, i have both also.  i found rpi1 just not quite fast enough, but rpi2 is a different story.  i love running "normal" software on it too (like my binary-only perforce client and debian iceweasel).
<chillum>	xark: http://images.highinbc.com/16xpi2.jpg
<chillum>	my general compute cluster
<xark>	sweet.  are those 2s?
<chillum>	yup
<chillum>	64 cores, 16gb ram
<chillum>	decent system
<chillum>	i would love to be able to let those communicate without the whole ethernet + switch
<chillum>	surely something could be done with the gpios
<chisight>	the gpios of a pi are operated by the peripheral controller at somewhat lower speed than main clock.
<chillum>	which makes reliable high speed communication over gpio problematic
<chillum>	lack of real time access
<chisight>	it makes it some work.
<deshipu>	there is dma
<chillum>	direct memory access?
<chisight>	will dma interact with the gpios?
<deshipu>	i know that the servo daemon uses dma to bit-bang the pwm
<chisight>	i know it will with spi.
<chisight>	interesting deshipu.
<deshipu>	servoblaster
<chillum>	the ethernet is done over usb
<chillum>	i am wondering if a simpler usb communication protocol using a hub could work
<larsemil>	http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=321542.0
<larsemil>	if anyone does know ^
<mun>	hi
<mun>	is it possible to control an arduino via usb from the console?
<deshipu>	yes
<mun>	e.g., a shell script that issues commands?
<deshipu>	but you still have to write the code for the arduino side
<mun>	deshipu: sure
<deshipu>	and you have to know which device is the arduino
<mun>	deshipu: but would it need to use an api?
<deshipu>	you will need to design one
<deshipu>	something simple, possibly
<mun>	deshipu: oh?
<mun>	hmm i wouldn't even know where to start...
<mun>	is there no api already available?
<deshipu>	like, 'when i send "a" do x, when i send "b", do y"
<deshipu>	millions
<mun>	deshipu: yeah, sure. but how does the shell script communicate with the arduino?
<deshipu>	echo "a" > /dev/usbtty0
<poppavic>	or whatever "port"
<mun>	how about in windows?
<poppavic>	i'm not that perverted
<deshipu>	no idea, probably something like echo "a" > com1
<mun>	right
<karlmag>	*lol@poppavic*
<mun>	well, i'd be happy with shell
<mun>	but on the arduino side, how should it read "a" as input?
<deshipu>	see the serial reading example in the examples
<mun>	ah
<mun>	analogreadserial?
<deshipu>	hmm, no
<deshipu>	let me check
<deshipu>	mun: communication/readsciistring
<mun>	nice
<mun>	thanks a lot
<deshipu>	i shows how to read numbers
<deshipu>	it*
<deshipu>	but you get the idea
<mun>	indeed
<poppavic>	i love when i accidentally delete files.. <mutter, bitch, grumble>
<mun>	time machine :)
<deshipu>	poppavic: version control systems ftw!
<mun>	i'm trying to switch d13 to high if 'a' is received and to low if 'b' is received
<mun>	http://pastebin.com/x4aahqy1
<mun>	i can switch it to high given 'a', but nothing happens given 'b'
<mun>	does anyone know what i might be doing wrong?
<blathijs>	mun: every byte is returned only once by serial.read()
<xark>	yeah, the first read() eats the byte.
<blathijs>	mun: so if you type something, it's either checked in the first _or_ the second byte
<xark>	mun: add something like   char  c = serial.read();   and replace the other read() calls with c
<blathijs>	mun: if you do what xark suggests, you can even remove the available() call, since read() returns -1 when no bytes are available (make sure that you use int c, not char c though)
<xark>	so...anybody check out the arduino "cloud ide" yet?
<blathijs>	did they release it?
<xark>	they released 1.6.4 and i thought a preview of cloud ide (but maybe i am mistaken).
<mun>	hmm
<mun>	i'm confused
<mun>	so serial.read() eats the byte
<xark>	maybe the blog article was the peek -> http://blog.arduino.cc/2015/05/05/sneak-peak-arduino-create/
<mun>	so if i type 'a' and serial.read() eats the byte, then wouldn't it be able to pick up 'b'?
<xark>	mun: no, because the loop restarts and it checks for 'a' again (and if it was 'b', oops too late, its gone).
<mun>	ohoh
<xark>	if you hit two b's really fast (with no -1 in between), you might get into 'b' if...
<mun>	adding char c = serial.read(); fixes it
<xark>	yes, now you can check for a, b c etc. without losing the char.
<mun>	ah, i could remove the .available() condition because .read() blocks?
<xark>	no, it will not block but return -1.
<mun>	oh
<xark>	as blathijs wisely mentioned, you do need to make it :    int c = serial.read();
<xark>	(as you can't tell -1 from 0xff in a char).
<mun>	yeah
<blathijs>	xark: technically,  there's a chance you press b between the first and second read as well, but since there is abit of code that runs between calls to loop(), it's more likely that the first read catches a letter than second
<mun>	so just a while(1) loop?
<yotson>	ehm, char is unsigned in arduino-land. :) http://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/char
<xark>	mun: that will work.   or    for (;;)
<mun>	great
<mun>	thanks
<yotson>	derp. is signed*...
<xark>	yotson: it is?  i am surprised as sign extension is kind of painful on avr...
<poppavic>	heh
<xark>	yotson: i am sure gcc has an option...
<poppavic>	xark:  it does, ut you can't get there thru the ide ;-)
<poppavic>	..and it would break the world.
<xark>	poppavic: true, but simple boards.txt change now.
<xark>	it would likely be ill-advised. :)
<xark>	however, portable code should not care. :)
<poppavic>	hmm, i try to not twiddle the ide bits - it'd prolly go up in flames and take my best lappy with it
<xark>	poppavic: you can do it in your sketch folder...
<xark>	however, it is not a biggie.
<xark>	but sign extension in avr requires like three instructions.
<poppavic>	no, you should care.. inititally, integer types were automatically considered signed - they went to what i call the "tristated char" after k&r
<poppavic>	xark:  it'd be completely different if they built and documented it as being automatically unsigned
<poppavic>	(they'd be the ones to suffer checking all the essential code survived the change)
<xark>	poppavic: i think it was undefined (because to pick one or the other would penalize some machine more than others).  you can specify if your code cares (most code doesn't operating on chars and use int8_t or uint8_t otherwise).
<xark>	it is documented as specify if your code cares. :)
<xark>	otherwise, whatever is "best" for the architecture (typically fastest).
<poppavic>	i went for many years assuming the compiler would see 'int' and 'char' and play signed.. it's disturbing when the compiler is kicked out from under yer feet
<xark>	poppavic: i think it was always unsigned by default on mips, e.g.
<poppavic>	xark:  <shrug> my k&r book is v1, so i am sure they changed things - or sold more and posted errata no one paid for
<xark>	i have k&r 1 too...
<mun>	hi again
<mun>	so for the code http://pastebin.com/tj4b6ngh
<mun>	should d13 switch to high if i do echo 'a' > com3?
<mun>	suppose com3 is the right port
<pwillard>	fyi:  loop() and while(1) do the same thing.  your code is rather redundant at this stage...
<pwillard>	and the thing is... you should be trying to perform a serial.read until you have serial.available()
<mun>	pwillard: but if i have an infinite loop inside loop(), loop() wouldn't return, right?
<pwillard>	should not, i mean
<pwillard>	loop() never "returns"
<pwillard>	what is inside loop() gets executed over and over again as fast as possible anyway  no need for your while(1) at this stage
<pwillard>	read this  http://pwillard.com/files/askmanualrev5.pdf  starting at page 58 for a good idea of how to build a simple serial parser.
<mun>	ok. thanks
<mun>	pwillard: but is echo 'a' > com[n] suppose to work?
<voicu>	hello
<voicu>	so i'm working on playing some music from my arduino
<pwillard>	well, "historically" that is the ms-dos way.  though i would not enclose the letter a in single quotes *and* it will send <cr> and <lf> characters that the remote end will see... so you need to remember that on the arduino side.  you think you send 'a' and you sent a plus carriage return and linefeed.  also... is your com port at the correct speed?  and... com ports higher than 9 need special "handling".
<mun>	the thing is it doesn't return
<mun>	it seems like it's blocked or something
<voicu>	i was wondering if anyone could give me some tips. right now, i have 8 bit wav samples (i.e. amplitude). i'm doing a really fine grained pwm to simulate a variable amplitude
<mun>	i'd have to ctrl-c to break
<pwillard>	ie; you can write com9  but com10 would need to be \\.\com10
<xark>	waaaay better to just get free terminal program (i like tera term).
<mun>	pwillard: if done properly, the echo command should return, right?
<pwillard>	doesn't return?  explain
<pwillard>	you will not see an echo back to your screen, no
<pwillard>	you can see an echo back if you connect pin 0 and 1 but that will also prevent your arduino from reading your data... you could echo backk with code... but right now that code is not there.
<mun>	hmm
<mun>	pwillard shouldn't it behave like an echo into stdout or a file that it returns
<pwillard>	my experience... no.  and that is the same with unix/linux as well.
<mun>	right. so the process remains open
<pwillard>	echo out to a com device "sends"... when you "send" to a screen, you see it... send to a com port the com port sees it, not your screen.  make sense?
<pwillard>	and there is no guarantee that your echo will the com port open.
<deshipu>	that was poetic
<pwillard>	will "keep" the com port open, i mean
<mun>	pwillard yes, but when you echo to a screen, file, etc the echo process exits
<deshipu>	especially without flow control
<pwillard>	yes, but does it persist
<mun>	if i now echo to com port, the process doesn't exit
<mun>	which seems a bit odd
<deshipu>	you might need to set the com port's parameters
<deshipu>	like the speed and stop bits and so
<deshipu>	on
<pwillard>	yeah, i said taht
<deshipu>	it's possible the port has hardware flow control enabled and just hangs there
<pwillard>	using echo is going to remain crude and unwieldy.
<pwillard>	1) write some code or 2) use a terminal program like putty.exe for testing
<mun>	are there more suitable shell commands for serial comm?
<deshipu>	screen :d
<pwillard>	com3 = windows... windows msdos shell is shite, powershell is a bit better, but not much.
<mun>	pwillard i agree that putty, tera term work better, but i'm trying to make the comm done in a shell script
<mun>	well, it's being called from mingw
<mun>	inside a makefile
<mun>	basically i'm trying to trigger it inside a makefile target
<deshipu>	why?
<pwillard>	<baffled> why do you think this is a good approach?
<mun>	deshipu if you recall, i'm trying to get my dev board to automatically switch to flash mode
<mun>	so i'm trying to get the arduino ground the flash pin when the target is called
<deshipu>	ah
<mun>	this won't even need a push button :)
<pwillard>	a few years back, when i needed a cli rs232 serial process, i wrote one using wxdevc++. you would be well served by writng a simple c program to do what you want and call it from mingw.
<deshipu>	you can even compile it as a dependency of that target
<mun>	oh right. a full fledge c program..
<voicu>	this might be a dumb question but if i have a list of amplitudes how do i transform it into frequencies? i know i should use the fourier transform but i'm not sure how
<mun>	i wonder if there's something leaner?
<pwillard>	voicu, sounds to me like you need a clue what your sample rate was and re-create it.
<mun>	is there no shell command more designed for serial communication?
<pwillard>	min, never was
<pwillard>	mun
<deshipu>	mun: powershell maybe? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12785638/command-for-opening-serial-port-in-windows-7
<voicu>	pwillard, i have the sample rate, what do you mean re-create it?
<pwillard>	in the olden days, we used gw-basic to do coms
<mun>	pwillard right
<deshipu>	there is an old dos command for setting the com parameters: http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/mode.mspx?mfr=true
<pwillard>	microsoft never made a decent shell until powerbasic...
<mun>	deshipu i was hoping to have it called from the makefile though
<pwillard>	i mean powershell... sorry... half asleep
<voicu>	pwillard, right now i'm using numpy.fft to transform 24000 samples (at ~11000hz) into frequencies. i get 24000 complex numbers
<deshipu>	mun: try with mode
<voicu>	i was thinking to just use the real values as frequencies. is that dumb?
<pwillard>	well, its a bit misguided, imho.
<mun>	deshipu you mean try echo with mode?
<voicu>	pwillard, well yes, that's why i'm asking. my math background is lacking
<pwillard>	mode is just equivalent of unix stty, no?
<arduino604>	hey, i got a problem with simplesdaudio, i installed everything as i did before and it throws error 130.
<deshipu>	pwillard: pretty much, yes
<deshipu>	mun: yes, first call mode to set the right parameters, then echo
<pwillard>	mun.  check this...  write your own tool.  http://www.phanderson.com/tm128/dev-cpp_tm128_1.html
<arduino604>	installed like 4-5 arduinos the same way as i did the new one and they worked, but this one... i'm speechless :( any help?
<pwillard>	voicu, sorry... i don't feel arduino is well suited to creating "audio" so i never do it.  can't help much.
<voicu>	ok, thanks anyway :)
<mun>	ok i'll give those a try!
<mun>	thanks
<arduino604>	hey, i got a problem with simplesdaudio, i installed everything as i did before and it throws error 130. installed like 4-5 arduinos the same way as i did the new one and they worked, but this one... i'm speechless :( any help?
<pwillard>	we hear you the first time.
<malinus>	voicu: you can easliy play 8000hz samples.
<arduino604>	what do you mean?
<malinus>	can't store too much of it, unless you use a sd card or similar
<malinus>	but for a 3-4 sec sample, you can just store it in the flash :)
<voicu>	malinus, i have something that kind of works (at ~10khz) but it sounds really bad
<arduino604>	there are 5 arduino boards, every single one is connected and programmed the same way. four of them work, one doesn't.
<voicu>	malinus, yes, that's what i'm doing, storing a few samples on flash (about 2 seconds worth now)
<pwillard>	1) you assume others have simplesdaudio here...  but there is probably nobody with it.  2) error 130 means nothing without context.  3) one board may be bad.   share a screenshot or pastebin the error text
<malinus>	voicu: bad compared to what, exactly? i think it sounds okay-ish @ 8khz, you can sound what it is.
<malinus>	*hear
<voicu>	malinus, no, it's clearly because i'm doing something wrong - it had a lot of background noise and its volume is low.
<voicu>	when i do a simple music player with tone it sounds pretty ok
<malinus>	volume has nothing to do with the mcu. remove the dc offset, use a band-pass filter, and amplify.
<malinus>	that should help with both noise and volume (somehow).
<pwillard>	you won't really get anything "pretty" from an uno without a lot of help.
<malinus>	probably not, but it's fun to try :)
<malinus>	xark: i found the quality is much better, running the pwm at 3 times the sample speed. i.e. 8khz sample, and 24 or 32khz pwm
<malinus>	i never understood why though.
<xark>	malinus: ideally, yes.  i was generating video so scan line interrupt rate was dictated.  ideally you want to be an integer multiple, but it is not 100% critical.
<xark>	(modulation rate vs pwm rate)
<xark>	what is max pwm, like 64khz?
<malinus>	xark: i'm pretty sure it can do fcpu?
<malinus>	well fcpu/2
<xark>	well, it ends up being 62500hz (62.5khz).
<sabesto>	 fcpu/(2*256)
<malinus>	well yeah, doh
<sabesto>	if what you said is correct (lowest prescaler is 2)
<malinus>	no, lowest is 1, just checked
<malinus>	(no prescaling)
<voicu>	malinus, how would you do it? i have a high speed pwm (1mhz) that simulates an amplitude
<sabesto>	http://www.cs.tut.fi/sgn/arg/rosti/1-bit/
<ei24>	hi, im programming a 1,8 tft display using a st7735r driver. with the driver you define a window on the screen which you write to. however, when you write to image data to ram, the command can only target the first pixel in the window, then you have to redefine the window. whats the reason to even define a window then? why not just have a command to select a single pixel?
<ei24>	i think you can only write to the first pixel in the window. i have been experimenting, and it seems to be the case
<malinus>	voicu: have one timer to "switch" the current sample (running at w/e your sample frequency is). and one that actually "plays" the voltage level trough pwm, running at a multiple of that frequency. obviously that can't really drive any speaker very good, so you need to filter+amplify.
<malinus>	xark: only for the timer that generates millis?
<xark>	correct.
<xark>	...pin 4 and 10
<malinus>	you should have 2 left then.
<malinus>	(timers)
<voicu>	malinus, so i need frequencies instead of amplitudes?
<gedamo>	ei24: is this the library you're using? https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit-st7735-library
<xark>	ei24: i don't think that is correct.  you can keep blasting pixels and it will fill the window (and wrap at edge).
<ei24>	gedamo: no im writing directly to the screen via assembly, though it should not matter
<voicu>	malinus, i have an amplifier and filter that a friend made. i'm not sure but i think it does what you say
<ei24>	xark: hmm ok, ill recheck my code then
<voicu>	my problem is how do i produce the right signal
<chandeepa>	hi
<chandeepa>	anyone
<chandeepa>	i want a big help
<chandeepa>	with arducam
<arduino604>	how can i know more about simplesdaudio's 130 error then?
<chandeepa>	hey arduino604
<voicu>	sabesto, is that link related to my issue?
<arduino604>	hey
<chandeepa>	arduino604 can you please help me with arducam?
<pwillard>	arduino604, we heve no idea what the context of error 130 is without you helping.
<arduino604>	pwilliard, then please tell me what do you need to know
<chandeepa>	pwillard
<arduino604>	chandeepa, i'm in a problem myself :/
<chandeepa>	arduino604 well any others?
<gedamo>	chandeepa: ask your question
<chandeepa>	gedamo can we chat in pvt?
<gedamo>	ask your question here, you're more likely to find someone able to help
<arduino604>	what i know is that my sd card works properly, used the testing code from arduino.cc
<pwillard>	so you have more than 1,  swap arduino boards... does the problem follow the arduino or the shield?
<arduino604>	it's on arduino uno, on both boards
<chandeepa>	ok gedamo i'm having arducam mini ov5642 and arduino mega 2560.. i uploaded example sketch "fifo" which comes with arducam library.... but the camera modules only provides me with http://i59.tinypic.com/10cofog.jpg kinds of image
<chandeepa>	i cannot assure my notion, but i think it is something with rgb
<pwillard>	you said you have 5... 1 doesn't work.    so you can imagine now why you saying "it's on arduino uno, on both boards" makes no sense as an answer.
<pwillard>	do you understand why i said "swap boards"?
<arduino604>	i'm trying to simplify. a few months ago i made four boards with simplesdaudio and they worked flawlessly, playback was crappy but it worked.
<pwillard>	so you no longer have them?
<chandeepa>	gedamo
<arduino604>	now i need to make another one which doesn't work, and i tried using another arduino uno board for it too
<arduino604>	yeah, i don't have those previous ones anymore
<ei24>	xark: ahh i see, i looked through another example, it seems to do it as well, freaking awesome that the driver works that way, speed it up quite a it!
<pwillard>	that's not how you made it sound at first.
<gedamo>	chandeepa: yes, i'm looking
<arduino604>	sorry, i twisted it a bit :)
<chandeepa>	gedamo any idea?
<pwillard>	and did you upgrade your ide in the meantime?
<arduino604>	yes, it's on 1.6.4 now
<pwillard>	either your board is bad or your library is bugged due to the new ide version.  you cold always try installing an older ide version to see if that helps.
<chandeepa>	speak speak
<chandeepa>	:d
<arduino604>	before upgrading, i was using ide 1.6.0, the same one which i used to program the previous boards
<chandeepa>	gedamo is taking his time or my time?
<arduino604>	tried using it first, then upgraded to 1.6.4
<chandeepa>	please help
<xark>	ei24: yeah, i found it pretty nice chip "api".  using hardware spi and taking advantage of the ~12 cycles during xfer was very helpful.
<gedamo>	chandeepa: what's the exact name of the example you're using?
<arduino604>	assuming that both of these boards are broken is a little bit extreme but i've already ordered a new one, but maybe there's something more i can do...
<chandeepa>	hang on gedamo
<chandeepa>	arducam_spi_ov5642_fifo_uart
<chandeepa>	gedamo
<xark>	ei24: some before and after logic analyzer captures: before https://i.imgur.com/lzw7fpp.png   after https://i.imgur.com/oq8vonj.png
<arduino604>	or... maybe could you recommend something else for playing sounds from an sd card? maybe there's something better than simplesdaudio?
<gedamo>	chandeepa: is the camera module being detected correctly?
<pwillard>	arduino604,  i don't know... try rolling back to recreate where you were before when it worked.
<chandeepa>	yes its detected gedamo
<pwillard>	1.64 is still bleeding edge and may have new bugs yet uncovered
<arduino604>	the only difference is the ide version but i'll try :d thanks for trying though, i appreciate it
<chandeepa>	gedamo its another here
<chandeepa>	http://i.imgur.com/bhszpwp.jpg?1
<pwillard>	well, i would hate to think you have bad boards... it's not impossible.   i just have no ide what a error 130 is without context.  where does that show up?
<arduino604>	let me show you the code, one sec
<arduino604>	http://pastebin.com/9jupyyvt
<arduino604>	brb in 3 mins
<chandeepa>	gedamo what do u think?
<pwillard>	so it displays an error as part of that last serial.print()...  ok
<chillsurf>	hi there. i need to find a relay to switch on 30a 230vac (number of swiotching operations doesnt matter, as it will trigger only in malfunction.the n.c pinouts will have continuous 30a current though
<chandeepa>	gedamo
<gedamo>	chandeepa: have you tried any other examples?
<chandeepa>	i can't find any gedamo ... i want to get the jpeg bytes to pc via serial port
<chandeepa>	(serial=usb) in the context
<arduino604>	yup pwillard, i'm just hopeless with these boards. sometimes they work flawlessly, and sometimes they are just... having the hump
<gedamo>	chandeepa: sorry, i don't have any ideas
<chandeepa>	gedamo are  you dealing with some other stuff too?
<chandeepa>	ah... hm... gedamo do u think it can be an error with cam module?
<ei24>	xark: nice!
<chillsurf>	can soemone point me out the types of relay packages? i need a relay to be mounted on pcb board but to screw wires on it.
<chandeepa>	ei24
<gedamo>	chandeepa: either that or a problem with transferring the image
<malinus>	voicu: you can try doing what i've said, to produce the right square wave.
<malinus>	you can always filter/amplify later.
<chandeepa>	hm...gedamo.... i purchased it from the official distributor of arducam...uctronics... i assume that there wont be errors in the module
<ei24>	chandeepa:?
<chandeepa>	ei24 can you please help me with my prob of arducam
<malinus>	chandeepa: what is your porblem with arducam? i think i might know this one :d
<chandeepa>	ah great malinus
<malinus>	*maybe* :)
<chandeepa>	malinus i'm having arducam mini ov5642 and arduino mega 2560.. i uploaded example sketch "fifo" which comes with arducam library.... but the camera modules only provides me with http://i59.tinypic.com/10cofog.jpg kinds of image
<chandeepa>	malinus another one's here ->http://i.imgur.com/bhszpwp.jpg?1
<malinus>	damn, sorry i don't know, i confused arducam with osd :d
<chandeepa>	malinus osd?
<chandeepa>	malinus i didn't get it
<malinus>	yeah, it's something else, nvm. sorry
<chandeepa>	ok malinus... do you know any others who deal with arducam?
<ei24>	chandeepa:sorry i have no experience with arducam or cams. i have not even successfully managed to upload code via the adruino ide yet, though i dont use it x)
<chandeepa>	oh
<chandeepa>	any others?
<chandeepa>	anyonnneeee?
<chandeepa>	vnagpal
<chandeepa>	_tpavel
<_tpavel>	chandeepa
<chandeepa>	_tpavel can you help me on my prob of arducam?
<_tpavel>	i'm not sure if this was the exact article, but you should read something like this: http://rurounijones.github.io/blog/2009/03/17/how-to-ask-for-help-on-irc/
<chandeepa>	_tpavel so are you asking me to dance on the floor or above?
<_tpavel>	so yeah, just ask your question directly and if someone is not busy and can help, he/she will answer. it's not nice or efficient to ping everyone that is online
<chandeepa>	_tpavel just say "i dont know" if you don't know
<chandeepa>	anything more than that would be reflected
<sibiria>	which programmer does the arduino ide want for serial-programming over usb-to-ttl?
<yeryry>	if you mean the usb built in to the uno or whatever, the programmer selection is irrelevant, you use the other upload option.
<sibiria>	no, i mean ch340/ftdi/pl2303 usb-to-ttl serial adapter
<yeryry>	the same, i think
<sibiria>	avrdude refuses to sync up with the device
<sibiria>	any specific serial settings maybe? baud rate, parity, stop bits etc?
<irixuser>	sibiria: on freebsd at least it just uses the serial device you prefer exposed in /dev
<kline>	irixuser: do you use irix?
<pwillard>	chandeepa... please try to stop being a gimme-pig.  i realise that we are "live" here but we also have "lives".  ;-p
<robhol>	left
<pwillard>	yeah, truth is that was somthing i meant to say an hour ago... i was in my buffer and i accidently sent it.
<karlmag>	pwillard: happens
<pwillard>	i had decided not to... but my tablet i dropped on my keyboard had other plans
<karlmag>	pwillard: of course murphy had other plans for you ;-)
<pwillard>	well, i try to keep my "curmudgeon" under control...
<karlmag>	hehe... right...  :-d
<karlmag>	i do catch myself more and more often in that too :-p
<pwillard>	otherwise i would be yelling "hey you kids, get off my lawn" all day.
<karlmag>	*lol*
<karlmag>	i would probably too.. and i don't even own a lawn
<pwillard>	http://www.quickmeme.com/img/03/03471464d2527d3ec8ecf4e2955be68b3bfe15a5c545a1d76cd58361adf28f78.jpg
<gedamo>	get off my lan! :p
<pwillard>	same here
<pwillard>	so... does the esp8266 make the ethernet and expensive wifi shield any less useful?  i mean, i never really saw the avr being able to do much networky stuff anyway... (just ordered one though)
<old-papa-work>	morning all, i'm kinda stuck on something.. i like to turn off a tone by pressing a button.  i have the tone and the button part working. but my problem is, if i want to re-trigger the tone, i can not figure a good way.
<old-papa-work>	it is probably simple, just right now in a lost loop..
<pwillard>	show your code.  might be a simple fix
<gedamo>	so you want to toggle the tone with the button? or turn off the tone while the button is held down?
<old-papa-work>	the program is kinda big, about 600 lines
<pwillard>	ouch
<old-papa-work>	yup, near complete..  it has a display, works on purge of tanks and selecting tanks, saving last look
<pwillard>	maybe you can look at an example i did.  it sounds like you need to keep track of some "modal" states.
<old-papa-work>	btw, that last project, it has pass emc tests both measure and signal bombbardment
<pwillard>	i made a button once that you could press and each time it would change to a different state...   it always new what you did *last* so it was easy to determine what to do next...  having kept track of state.
<old-papa-work>	in final stages of safety.
<old-papa-work>	toggling
<pwillard>	if this helps... great...   if not  meh.  i tried.  http://pwillard.com/?p=79
<old-papa-work>	ok, i take a look.. maybe i can get an idea..
<sibiria>	the old "rebounce" problem... :)
<pwillard>	yeah, well, i didn't need to fix that in my case.
<sibiria>	old-papa-work: simple modal/state variable will solve your problem
<old-papa-work>	using bounce2.  i have 2 buttons.. the switch of tanks works.. just the warning tone..
<pwillard>	well, my sample was more about keep track of state than number of states.
<old-papa-work>	state = !state; ?
<pwillard>	toggle
<pwillard>	mtowtsac
<old-papa-work>	i have been trying to remember the state = !state...  and i could not.. i saw that as a blink  and tried to find it..  pwillard, i fav your page..
<pwillard>	my keyboard is posessed today
<sibiria>	old-papa-work: it works good for inverting 1/0
<sibiria>	obviously not if you need to cycle through states
<pwillard>	well, the guy i wrote that for was baffled about cycling states until i did that for him.
<old-papa-work>	yup, this is that last part of the code. then run it thru its paces and make a board..
<pwillard>	man... totally off topic... but i think http://leanpub.com is so cool.
<old-papa-work>	pwillard, you still use your hp touchpad?
<pwillard>	going strong and loving it
<pwillard>	use it every day
<old-papa-work>	me 2.. wife uses her's everyday for games..
<pwillard>	wife sometimes forgets to charge hers... but she uses it alot as well...
<old-papa-work>	i have no idea if jcsullins has any updates..  been great since i last did ours..
<pwillard>	i have left mine running 10 from last year sometime... seems stable and everything works
<pwillard>	https://flic.kr/p/7wbab7  old skool microcontroller.
<sibiria>	in ceramic capsule with golden leads
<sibiria>	beautiful
<pwillard>	i have a boxful of crap like that
<sibiria>	one of my old c64s has the first rev vic-ii in ceramic with gold leads
<sibiria>	rare-ish
<sibiria>	btw., does anyone know an ebay vendor that sells stripboards with full length tracks?
<sibiria>	i can't find anything but stripboards with unconnected single holes
<sibiria>	china is all about the non-track versions
<pwillard>	sibiria, https://www.dropbox.com/s/etyntkfok8p9jkt/img_20150508_100943.jpg?dl=0  sorry for bad phone camera
<sibiria>	you've been salvaging :)
<pwillard>	yes
<pwillard>	3rd one from bottom left is an early 6800, you can see the thick file traces from the center out to the gold pins... (got washed out)
<pwillard>	thick film, rather
<sibiria>	yeah white ceramic model, not often seen these days
<pwillard>	lots of gi chips as well... (gi was basically the company invented what we now call pic controllers)
<flea86>	pwillard nice classic ic collection you have there! :d
<pwillard>	the other side of the same box i have over 100 various eproms  25v, 21v and 12v
<flea86>	pwillard i too have some of the old dirty sand in my closet too - oldest in my collection is an i8080 :)
<pwillard>	6800 is from 1975...
<pwillard>	8088 from 1978
<pwillard>	various other intel 8000 series from 1974 onward
<flea86>	pwillard: i said i8080
<flea86>	ie the one with the silly multiple power rails.. including a -ve rail iirc
<pwillard>	it's silly to collect this stuff
<flea86>	perhaps, but ic's don't take up as much room as complete vintage machines so..
<pwillard>	yeah, i recall that crap... but it also means i have old switcher supplies with all those voltages.  i think i might even have a 1702 eprom
<flea86>	heh that reminds me - i brought some 2708 eproms to tech school one day back in 1992.. was told even then they were too old to be programmed by the school's equipment lol
<flea86>	wanted to use them for a rom-driven state machine iirc
<flea86>	should've kept them too.. those were very appealing to the eye :d
<pwillard>	yeah, agreed
<azv4>	anyone have some amazing code that handles keybed input from fatar keybeds for arduino and calculates velocity, accepts some analog inputs for pitchwheel and volume, or know of an open project like this?
<dada>	azv4: midi shield maybe?
<chillsurf>	sorry but because it is too difficult for me to find a relay of this type, can you please help me find one? the problem is that i have never used a socket for a relay before. all i want is a general purpose relay of 1 pole (form c - n.o & nc) to be able to power the coil with 5vdc and the contacts to handle 30a in 230vacthe tricky thing here is that i want the contacts to be mounted  with wires and screws. and i cant find a relay like that
<chillum>	chillsurf: like this: www.ebay.ca/itm/291414706464 ?
<chillum>	$1, cheap
<chillsurf>	chillum did you read my post?
<chillsurf>	http://www.mouser.com/productdetail/te-connectivity-pb/t92p7d52-12/?qs=sgaepimzzmtszcf3xbhmw6vma%2fmpjxophc8grbntklm%3d
<chillsurf>	like these. i need to handle 30a
<darkuranium>	chillum, it's ridiculous how cheap these things are when ordered from china
<chillsurf>	for an air codnitioning device
<chillum>	well that one is 10 amps, not 30. do you really need 30?
<chillum>	oh
<chillsurf>	i need only to terminate the contacts via screws
<chillsurf>	not in the pcb
<chillum>	no idea then
<chillum>	darkuranium: bless their mass producing souls. i love cheap stuff
<darkuranium>	chillum, aye
<darkuranium>	chillum, especially things like zif sockets... 27-30 eur here, like 1-3 usd from china :p
<chillsurf>	chillum: cheap are good for your own purposes
<darkuranium>	(yeah, i know those are knockoffs, but i don't care for my personal projects)
<chillsurf>	when someone asks you to make something you need to be sure that they pass all the qualifications
<pwillard>	solid state relay chillsurf
<chillum>	chillsurf: yes, well i would not use cheap stuff for high current
<chillum>	or for public consumption
<chillsurf>	solid state with screws mounting for contacts?
<pwillard>	most do, yes
<chillum>	i want to get a custom relay board made with a built in esp8266
<chillum>	wifi enabled relays
<chillsurf>	anything in mind? i cant find one in mouser and i am really frustrated
<darkuranium>	chillum, why not just separate two modules?
<darkuranium>	chillum, esp8266 + relay module
<chillsurf>	chillum: have done it in the past using a physical webserver and post data there
<chillsurf>	then i have a website to switch things on and off
<chillum>	darkuranium: if i make a board with it all together then i have a product, otherwise it is just some parts
<darkuranium>	chillum, so get two parts and put 'em in a box.
<darkuranium>	chillum, i just bought this, btw: http://www.ebay.com/itm/331443721631?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&sspagename=strk%3amebidx%3ait
<chillum>	great device
<chillum>	it is really not that expensive to have a custom board made even if you only get a few hundred
<darkuranium>	of course not
<darkuranium>	i mostly bought that out of interest.
<darkuranium>	(to play around with it, and try to reprogram it)
<chillum>	i want to try my hand at design for manufacturing
<pwillard>	http://www.bgmicro.com/dual-40a-solid-state-relay-24-280vac.aspx  assuming you are switching ac
<chillsurf>	pwillard: they are too expensive
<chillsurf>	starting from 70$ in mouser
<chillsurf>	for 30a
<chillum>	i may just order a handful of custom pcb and hand assemble a few
<pwillard>	$9
<chillum>	regarding the relay, you might try a hardware store.
<pwillard>	well, that one does not have screw terminals, sorry
<deshipu>	$14 with shipping for 10 5x5cm prototype boards
<chillum>	deshipu: it is amazing how cheap they can make custom pcbs
<deshipu>	with two weeks of waiting
<chillum>	it is because they are using digital printing instead of silk screening and they can switch jobs in seconds instead of 40 minutes
<chillum>	used to be that there were stuff minimums
<deshipu>	chillum: yeah, they have most of it automated, and they cut corners, for instance by dumping the chemicals to the sewers...
<chillum>	also they ahve gotten very good at auto panelization of different jobs
<chillum>	chemicals in the sewers ehh? i will be sure to order from a place with a different sewer than mine
<zap0>	the only reason for pcb's is for discrete components;  that's just admitting you suck at software!
<chillum>	the automation is amazing, i watched a youtube video about how they did 4 layer boards. just amazing tech
<gedamo>	"dumping the chemicals to the sewers" -- that's the sort of thing that leads to mutant turtles :|
<zap0>	now i feel like pizza
<chillum>	zap0: i don't follow. i just don't want wires
<deshipu>	zap0: fpga?
<chillum>	they only discrete components i am using are the power converting stuff
<chillum>	my current project is nothing more than a gps chip, a esp8266, an atmega328(with crystal and caps), a microsd slot and once i make it portable power management
<chillum>	using my breadboard power supply it does not even have a resistor
<chillum>	though the final design calls for a rgb light and button so there will be some discrete compnents
<darkuranium>	that reminds me, i gotta lookup about running esp8266 code from sdcard
<chillum>	darkuranium: well with nodemcu there does not seem to be support yet
<chillum>	i am using the atmega328 to do the sd writing for me which is annoying
<chillum>	since esp does do spi it should be able to handle it but no modules seem to exist
<chillum>	it may be possible if you code it in c, but that toolchain looks unhandy
<chillum>	if you are good at low level device drivers you could write one, if so please let me know
<darkuranium>	chillum, what's the usual language then?
<darkuranium>	asm?
<chillum>	well the default from manufacturer is a at command set
<chillum>	there is this: https://github.com/esp8266/esp8266-wiki/wiki/toolchain
<chillum>	which lets you get low level on it but is very low level
<darkuranium>	i know about at
<darkuranium>	but i mean for programming the device itself, isn't there a c compiler?
<chillum>	the espressif toolchain does that
<chillum>	i think
<chillum>	never actually used it
<darkuranium>	that's what i want to try out.
<chillum>	an example of blink: https://github.com/esp8266/source-code-examples/tree/master/blinky/user
<darkuranium>	i know i can use the at commands, but i want to try out programming the device itself
<darkuranium>	looks like your typical mcu code
<darkuranium>	except user_init instead of main(), i guess.
<chillum>	it is a typical mcu under the hood
<chillum>	just different hardware hooks
<darkuranium>	yup.
<darkuranium>	chillum, i've used both pic (c and asm) and barebones avr (as opposed to arduino; c only, though), so i don't expect the esp to be too difficult.
<chillum>	can you call c or asm from lua?
<chillum>	it someone wrote spi->sd->fat16/32 drivers for nodemcu i would send them a gift of bc's finest
<old-papa-work>	boy, that was a task to get that working..  with 2 tanks, each giving a warning tone at 2 stages and 1 over all for both, did a buffer[] assign 1 / situation.
<malinus>	chillum: you already have fat16 libraries for arduino/c, just make some hooks for nodejs?
<loshki>	bc's finest what?
<chillum>	malinus: is it that easy? never worked in lua or c till now so i am sorting futzing through
<chillum>	loshki: freenode policy prevents me from saying
<malinus>	i never used anything other than c/c++/asm with mcu's i have no idea how the nodejs/w.e.->c works. look it up
<amun_ra>	chillum: iirc, you can't call anything low level
<chillum>	that is unfortunate
<djmax>	i'm trying to talk to an arduino from a chrome os app... i can do control/bulk/isochronous/interrupt transfers - which is arduino using?
<deshipu>	djmax: what are you talking about?
<djmax>	it seems like chromeos doesn't expose serial port directly, it exposes the usb device and i can talk to that.
<blathijs>	djmax: on chrome apps you can normally access serial ports, or example the pinoccio hq app uses this
<djmax>	can i tell it's an arduino there? i was using vid/pid via usb to figure that bit out
<blathijs>	djmax: not sure what usb transfers are used. if you're serious about implementing this (i'd reconsider, usb is complicated), have a look at the acm serial driver in linux
<blathijs>	djmax: or look at the source code for the 16u2 firmware, that implements the arduino side of it
<djmax>	let me see if i can tie usb device to serial port...
<djmax>	hmph. not easily.
<blathijs>	djmax: i think in the pinoccio chrome app, it checks the vidpids to see if the device is present, but if so, it just tries the serial ports one by one. the code is a bit messy, but it's here: https://github.com/pinoccio/chrome-app-pinoccio
<djmax>	yeah, was afraid of that. vid/pid don't come back in the example i have here, but i guess there's not much i can do about it
<blathijs>	djmax: if you're on linux and can access /sys, you can find out from there (but i guess you won't have permission for that)
<xxvaliumxx>	and just now i found out that f11 fullscreens mirc
<xxvaliumxx>	brilliant.
<malinus>	xxvaliumxx: try alt-f4
<xxvaliumxx>	malinus: oh come now, you don't really think i'm going to fall for that do you?
<mun>	blathijs: hi there :)
<mun>	blathijs: my little flash mode controller is working wonderfully well :d
<mun>	deshipu: ^^
<firehopper>	afk
<deshipu>	mun: awesome!
<deshipu>	mun: you used mode?
<deshipu>	mun: or something else?
<mun>	deshipu: yeah, mode. but i spent hours debugging it
<deshipu>	fun
<mun>	had to add shell = cmd.exe
<deshipu>	ah, it's an internal command
<mun>	and need to manually sleep/timeout after mode
<deshipu>	ouch
<deshipu>	crazy
<mun>	between mode and echo
<mun>	i need to sleep/timeout/ping for about 2 seconds after mode
<mun>	terrible
<mun>	but, as long as it works now :)
<mun>	a quick question: in readasciistring, it has while (serial.available() > 0) in loop()
<mun>	why isn't it an if clause instead, i.e. if (serial.available...)?
<firehopper>	back
<sibiria>	mun: effectively the same thing, just different semantics
<sibiria>	while() is a conditional loop
<mun>	sibiria: yeah, but does it actually iterate in practice?
<sibiria>	as long as the condition is met, it will
<mun>	sibiria: so suppose there's an infinite loop in loop(), would loop() return?
<mun>	or does it even return?
<sibiria>	if it were an if clause, the body would execute once then pass. the while body will execute while its condition is met, then exit
<sibiria>	if there is nothing else in the main loop, they will both be similar
<sibiria>	if there's something before or after the body, they will obviously differ
<kingeli>	hi everyone
<mun>	sibiria: so if it was an infinite loop, would loop() be called only once?
<mun>	and then infinitely execute the while loop?
<sibiria>	if the while-body inside loop() evaluates to true infinitely, the body will never exit, and loop() will only occur once
<mun>	effectively, is the call to loop() itself inside an infinite loop, i.e. while(1) { loop(); }?
<mun>	right
<sibiria>	yes, loop() is an infinite loop
<sibiria>	while(true){...}
<kingeli>	anyone got any experience with gsm shields?
<mun>	someone earlier in this channel suggested something different
<sibiria>	that is what it is. there might be something catching a return or exit from the loop, i have no idea
<mun>	your version is the intuitive implementation to me
<kingeli>	so many users online, yet not many people talking here... :(
<sibiria>	the avr framework probably does something between calling loop() each time, but for the user, programmatically, it's an infinite loop
<sibiria>	kingeli: it could be that no one around has any experience with gsm modules :)
<mun>	ok. thanks
<kingeli>	sibiria: that's too bad.
<sibiria>	kingeli: stick around. different crowd on different hours
<kingeli>	sibiria: so what? am i supposed to spam my question every now and then? haha :p
<sibiria>	kingeli: yes, but i think it would be appreciated if every now and then meant a few hours between :)
<poppavic>	some of us are coding and debugging
<kingeli>	what are you guys up to ?
<poppavic>	irc is nearly as "event-horizon" as email, amusingly
<kingeli>	ok
<poppavic>	i'm building a makefile, and then a stupid parser, so i can manage to build shit the ide *does* poorly.
<kingeli>	cool ^^
<poppavic>	it would be, if i wasn't fighting idiocies. (actually should not even be necessary!)
<poppavic>	given the lack of sensible code, thank bog for redirection and verbosity
<kingeli>	i presumed that it would be easy, code-wise?
<leearl>	yo
<leearl>	join #engrish
<qwyos>	any way to turn on cleartype/truetype/anything that will make consolas 17 not look bad in arduino ide?
<zap0>	gedamo,  imagine a cluster of these?!?!     what is a intel i7 cost?  $300..    or 33 of those...    which would give you 16gig or ram
<bberg>	sup fellas
<qwyos>	any way to turn on cleartype/truetype/anything that will make consolas 17 not look bad in arduino ide?
<dgtlmoon>	greetins!
<dgtlmoon>	i'm planning on doing a atmega2560 diy arduino, i have a usb-asp that lets me burn the code via mosi/miso etc lines, that should be enough to install the bootloader and get it running as an arduino right?
<blathijs>	mun: good to hear it's working for you now :-d
<xxvaliumxx>	hmm.  i plug a chinese smartwatch into my pc to charge and it comes up with com port on the screen
<xxvaliumxx>	i was almost concerned until i remembered that it has updatable firmaware
<qwyos>	what about a small, qwerty, arduino-compatible keyboard? (like those seen in old smartphones)
<hello_there>	hi everyone! i have a quick question - i'd like to use an arduino nano to read data from over uart, make some modifications, then send the processed data to a connected pc.
<hello_there>	do i just do this by issuing serial.read() on the arduino, processing the data, then issuing serial.println() to send the data to the pc?
<blathijs>	hello_there: sounds like you really need two uarts instead of one? one for your device, one to send stuff to the pc (which gets translated to usb by a separate chip)?
<hello_there>	hmm, that's what i was afraid of, but i think you're right.  is there a way to forward instrument data which has been read from the uart directly to the pc?  without first processing it?
<sibiria>	if you don't need/want to process it, why use an arduino as intermediary step? why not just connect your instrument directly to the pc?
<sibiria>	there are plenty of $2 usb-to-ttl serial adapters that will perform exactly that task
<hello_there>	i'd considered doing that, but i'd like the arduino to take some commands from the pc like resetting the instrument and sending status data about the instrument.
<hello_there>	it might be a good idea to combine the arduino with a simple adapter to do this...
<sibiria>	i can't recall if the nano's pin 0/1 is directly connected to its usb serial adapter leading back to the pc, or if that is separate
<sibiria>	i know the mega and due has additional serial ports at least
<blathijs>	hello_there: you could try the arduino leonardo or micro, those have native usb for the pc connection, leaving one free uart
<sibiria>	nano (and all other 168/328-based arduinos) should have just one port iirc
<hello_there>	i believe it is in the nano.  the reason i've chosen the nano (but haven't ordered it yet) is i'm very size constrained.  the sensor i'm reading produces data at a fairly low data rate, about 1hz, could i use a software serial library emulate a uart?
<batch>	hello
<hello_there>	and i wasn't familiar with the micro/leonardo, let me look into them.
<batch>	is here any li-on battery expert?
<batch>	maybe?
<blathijs>	hello_there: there's softwareserial and altsoftserial which can emulate a uart. they have some limitions (needing full cpu attention, disabling interrupts, etc depending on the flavor)
<blathijs>	batch: better just ask your real question and hope someone with an answers stops by
<hello_there>	well, you guys have been super helpful, thanks for giving me some things to think about :)
<sibiria>	how many serial ports on the atmega32u4?
<sibiria>	is that the one with integrated usb port?
<batch>	hmmm it isn't arduino related but you guy's know enough about electricity soo
<batch>	i want do mod my laptopbattery
<batch>	more power
<batch>	i can give exact details
<blathijs>	sibiria: 32u4 has one uart, but has native usb so it can talk to the pc without using a uart
<sibiria>	the micro sounds like a perfect match then
<batch>	i want to know if i can put more w/h in it
<batch>	watt per hour
<hello_there>	yeah, it does, i'm looking into it right now :)
<sibiria>	i'm not an expert on electrity, less so on batteries, but i suspect you can't increase the watt-hours without putting more battery mass in :p
<hello_there>	batch: you probably can since you can often buy higher capacity cells.  basically - open the battery, check out what kind of cells it uses (voltage), and buy ones that have a higher capacity.  but beware, if you screw something up the battery basically becomes a bomb/fire waiting to happen.
<blathijs>	batch: i guess changing the battery might need changes to the charging circuit
<hello_there>	in my opinion, it's hard to compete on a price-level with some cheap third party battery.  it'd be cheaper (and probably safer) to just get one of those.
<batch>	hmmm some module between it maybe?
<batch>	i was on www.dx.com and saw lot's of dc to dc modules etc
<batch>	or ac to dc
<batch>	don't remember exactly
<blathijs>	batch: and indeed, lithium batteries can be dangerous. if you use battery packs from e.g. adafruit etc., these often have protection circuits built in. if you're going to work with raw cells, without associated protection circuits, you should probably really know what you're doing...
<hello_there>	batch: you could break out the connection and essentially add another battery, but that ruins the form factor of the computer entirely.
<batch>	true true
<batch>	it's asus
<batch>	battery's are build to die
<hello_there>	this might be close to what you're looking for in a safer form factor http://www.amazon.com/energizer-xp18000-universal-external-netbooks/dp/b002k8m9hc
<batch>	external battery hello_there ?
<hello_there>	yeah, basically.
<carpii>	ive wired up a 20*4 lcd display correctly (im 100% sure), but all i see is each character showing as a solid block, and nothing i send down the data pins changes the display. has anyone had this problem? its a 5v model and im supplying 5v and using example code.... http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/lcd-20-4-backlight-blue
<hello_there>	some laptops actually have "slice batteries" that can be attached to the bottom of the computer, for example: http://www.amazon.com/thinkpad-battery-19-cell-slice/dp/b004uc59q4
<batch>	hello_there, that's what i'm talkin about! thanks man
<batch>	let's see if i can find some like that
<batch>	thx man
<hello_there>	batch, unless your computer was made to take advantage of something like that, they probably don't make one for it.  there is a port on the bottom of thinkpads (docking station port) which accepts the battery.
<batch>	i have no clue
<batch>	:(
<batch>	someone told me higher range battery would overclock it
<batch>	isn't necessary, only need entire life to last :p
<batch>	with same performance
<sibiria>	you can't add more voltage on the board input to overclock your laptop
<sibiria>	even if your laptop's bios would offer you control over the multipler and base clock, the voltage regulator to the cpu is what needs to be fiddled with
<sibiria>	not the battery output
<hello_there>	batch, unfortunately you're out of luck, i think.  typically, certain motherboards and processors on desktops will let you increase the clock of the processor and the clock multiplier of the processor.  doing this lets you overclock the processor.  at some point, the processor will become unstable so you increase the voltage and, hopefully, the processor is stable at the higher voltage.
<ozzzy>	neat... i'll rectify the 480v three phase and really overclock
<sibiria>	i do that for my stove
<sibiria>	to get dinner faster
<batch>	xd
<hello_there>	doing so it a great way to squeeze more performance out of a processor, but it also increases heat and power usage significantly.  that's why people often spend a lot of money on large heat sinks or water cooling systems for their desktops.  unfortunately, you can't really overclock your laptop because heat )and powering it) are bigger problems in a laptop than a desktop.  even if you somehow managed to increase voltage, clock
<batch>	well i'll see
<sibiria>	batch: all you have to see is if your laptop's bios offers you control over the multiplier and base clock
<hello_there>	it would be throttled due to heat to prevent damage to it.  certain high-end cell phones produce so much heat they get throttled, and they use maybe 2-4% as much power as your laptop.
<sibiria>	if not, there is no go
<batch>	oh oke sibiria, i allready saw there are alot of options in it
<carpii>	overclocking a laptop is a bad idea. the entire form factor is built with certain heat parameters in mind, its not like a desktop where you can just overclock it and increase ventilation/dissipation
<batch>	should check it out again then
<sibiria>	overvolting it is a bad idea. higher clock doesn't exclusively mean a requirement for higher voltage
<batch>	yeah indeed
<batch>	as cpu doesn't have heatsinks and ontop fan
<batch>	ah it does have
<batch>	forgot
<batch>	but yeah
<batch>	but small yes
<batch>	what was i thinkin
<sibiria>	intel's core arch and onwards are very rewarding in terms of running faster without any added voltage
<sibiria>	usually comes down to having the luck of getting a high quality die managing it
<sibiria>	the core 2 duo in my laptop is by intel nominally specced for 0.95 to 1.25 volts or so, from lowest to highest clock, but mine is of such good yield that it actually runs at highest frequency even on 0.95 volts
<hello_there>	sibiria, isn't that what turbocore or whatever they call it is all about?  it overclocks itself for a short period of time?
<hello_there>	in the newer i series processors?
<batch>	cpu:       dual core intel core i5-3230m (-ht-mcp-) cache 3072 kb
<batch>	           clock speeds max 3200 mhz 1 1202 mhz 2 1204 mhz 3 1360 mhz 4 1429 mhz
<sibiria>	not sure what intel's "turbo boost" is about on fundamental level
<batch>	not sure if it's worth with this
<batch>	each problem brings other problems
<carpii>	i think turbo boost is basically adaptive power based on whether or not its currently struggling
<batch>	pfff
<batch>	there's some law of it
<batch>	law of jamie ...
<batch>	but programming related
<carpii>	hm
<carpii>	programming related?
<batch>	h/o
<batch>	yeah i thought
<carpii>	relating to what?
<carpii>	nm, just realised what h/o means :)
<batch>	http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/jamie_zawinski#external_links
<sibiria>	hmm... so many chinese arduino micro clones that uses the mini form factor with several pins unconnected
<batch>	some people, when confronted with a problem, think "i know, i'll use regular expressions." now they have two problems.
<batch>	ain't no law lol
<carpii>	to be fair, thats kinda tongue in cheek
<batch>	anyways thanks for the help, i'll try to figure out
<batch>	what's that carpii ?
<dniz0r>	hello errrybody
<dniz0r>	looking for some advice
<batch>	not familiar with that scentence
<carpii>	just the comment about regexps being a problem
<dniz0r>	anyone have recommendations of moisture sensors that can transmit data wirelessly
<carpii>	more of a funny anecdote than a law i think :)
<blathijs>	sibiria: iirc turbo boost means to clock a core higher when the other cores aren't being used, since then there's less heat generated by the other cores
<dniz0r>	im currently using standard sensors to monitor soil moisture,.. however everyhting is wire at the moment.. i  need a wireless oslution
<batch>	yeah carpii hehe
<carpii>	actually it seems most of jamies laws are all tongue in cheek :p
<dniz0r>	that doesnt rely on individual microcontrollers per reading
<dniz0r>	id like ot put 8 sensors in soil
<dniz0r>	and read the data from a single point
<carpii>	i havent heard of them before, i thoiught you meant an accepted law like moores law or something :p
<sibiria>	blathijs: ah right, same as amd, providing an extra kick for mostly single-threaded applications
<batch>	well now you know carpii
<carpii>	yep :)
<batch>	it has something unique
<batch>	good enough to become on wiki
<batch>	:p
<blathijs>	dniz0r: with xbee wireless modules you can remotely read out pins to some degree, even without a microcontroller / arduino attached?
<dniz0r>	blathijs: thanks for the response!  yea man,. i have an xbee shield as well on my arduino
<dniz0r>	however i think my bottle neck is actually the sensors themselves
<dniz0r>	asi need to transmit data wirelessly from individual sensors to the microcrontolleer
<dniz0r>	forgive my b000bness
<dniz0r>	hehe *n00bness
<dniz0r>	so im currently reading analog signals
<carpii>	were all mostly ehre to learn :)
<dniz0r>	a0-a5
<dniz0r>	however if the actuall sensors supported xbee
<blathijs>	dniz0r: i might have misunderstood your question, then. but in anycase, bedtime for me, so good luck!
<dniz0r>	hahah thanks man
<dniz0r>	rest well
<carpii>	dnixo, i dont think xbee needs a mp as such, but the recieving one would in order for you to interpet it
<dniz0r>	i need ot transmit data from the *hopefully* wireless sensors  tot he arduino
<dniz0r>	so i can build data
<dniz0r>	and metrix
<carpii>	ive a few xbees but tbh ive not used them yet
<dniz0r>	ive not used mine either
<carpii>	started playing with the esp8266 instead
<dniz0r>	my wiring looks all crazy on my breadboard at the moment too
<dniz0r>	in order to bring in all those analog signals
<dniz0r>	*err analog readings
<carpii>	whats your project?
<sibiria>	you can get 4xx mhz transmitter+receiver module for like $2 each
<dniz0r>	carpii: i row marijuana
<dniz0r>	*grow
<carpii>	aha ok
<dniz0r>	but this can be applied to everything
<carpii>	what sort of distance we talking tho?
<dniz0r>	the plants are withing 2 feet of each other
<dniz0r>	the microcontroller can be int he same room
<dniz0r>	which is withing a 400 sq ft area
<qwyos>	he's getting seri0us there
<carpii>	and what you tryna do? add a sensor to each plant ?
<sibiria>	the dumbest solution would be to hook something simple, like a digispark or mini up to the rf transmitter to send readings from the analog pins
<sibiria>	can be done with an off-board attiny as well to avoid using a whole arduino so to speak
<sibiria>	those 3-4xx mhz transmitter+receiver kits are also very easy to work with using the virtual wire library
<sibiria>	like pulling data from a serial port
<dniz0r>	sibiria: yea? cool man,. i havent looked into that yet,.. im googling as we speak
<sibiria>	dniz0r: http://www.ebay.com/itm/1pairs-433mhz-rf-transmitter-module-and-receiver-link-kit-for-arduino-arm/271712582457?_trksid=p2047675.c100005.m1851&_trkparms=aid%3d222007%26algo%3dsic.mbe%26ao%3d1%26asc%3d30794%26meid%3d806291e8222044f88baab9d95fe37b33%26pid%3d100005%26rk%3d2%26rkt%3d6%26sd%3d271860872420&rt=nc
<dniz0r>	!! thanks meng
<dniz0r>	looking at it right now
<sibiria>	they come in an array of frequencies as well with a few mhz between
<dniz0r>	im assuming i connect the reciver link ot the arduino
<dniz0r>	however
<dniz0r>	how will this work if i have more than 10 sensors ?
<dniz0r>	as it seems its a on 1x1 basis ??
<dniz0r>	wb carpii
<dniz0r>	sibiria: thanks for the isnight man
<dniz0r>	it will be extremeless helpfull
<dniz0r>	im assuming you need a shield to mange 14 readings
<dniz0r>	my uno only has 5
<dniz0r>	so with my limited knowledge i assume i can only get 5 readings ?
<dniz0r>	a0-a5 ?
<sibiria>	if the sensors output analog, yes
<carpii>	i wish i knew more to help you, but im kinda noob myself. i *think* you may be able to use a multiplexor to read several analog signals from just one pin though
<carpii>	http://playground.arduino.cc/learning/4051
<sibiria>	per arduino, that is
<carpii>	dont quote me on that though
<sibiria>	but what's stopping you from using one arduino for every 6 plants?
<sibiria>	6 moisture sensors -> 1 arduino that sends over one rf link
<sibiria>	1 rf receiver per digital pin -> receiving arduino
<sibiria>	6*14 reading possible for each receiving nano
<ozzzy>	or use a mega with 54 io pins
<sibiria>	carpii: the virtualwire lib is similar to the serial lib
<carpii>	ah i see
<sibiria>	you just poll each construct to find out if there's data waiting in the buffer
<carpii>	but doiing this with xbee seems like its gonna get expensive pretty quickly
<sibiria>	that's why you use the $1 rf transceiver kits
<sibiria>	carpii: http://i1295.photobucket.com/albums/b625/timluchina/1_conew1_zpsfe23ed0c.jpg
<carpii>	this is some budget rf soln ?
<sibiria>	yeah
<sibiria>	$1 each
<carpii>	cute
<sibiria>	(and they work)
<the_coolest>	hmm, this is pretty impressive https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598272670/chip-the-worlds-first-9-computer
<carpii>	if he had 6 of them hitting same rcvr, could rcvr identify which one its coming from?
<sibiria>	carpii: uncertain
<carpii>	or its just a direct 1-1 link?
<carpii>	ah oki
<sibiria>	it's mainly an ad-hoc link, but i suspect you could combard the frequency with tokenized data and just keep reading until you pull a functional message
<sibiria>	bombard*
<carpii>	yeah maybe
<carpii>	assuming they have a unique token somehow
<sibiria>	that part isn't complicated
<carpii>	tbh tho, if i was growing marijuana, id just plant a probe in each plant, and manually wire it up
<sibiria>	another trick would be to let each sensor send with several seconds between and trigger them individually
<sibiria>	so they did not overlap
<carpii>	yea
<carpii>	even then could be hard to synchroinise tho
<sibiria>	and if they do, no problem: just wait until you get a proper reading
<sibiria>	you're not likely to need readings every few seconds, but rather once an hour or so
<carpii>	yeah true, not like sensors are going to be changing every second
<ozzzy>	or find sensors that'll do one-wire
<carpii>	i sense we might be solving a problem for a guy thats already gone tho :p
<sibiria>	he's still here
<sibiria>	but now we're ready for our own growing biz
<sibiria>	get to it, gents
<carpii>	hehe
<carpii>	my seed just rose by 0.2c
<carpii>	nm, i should probably rephrase that
<flea86>	lol
<carpii>	hehe
<dniz0r>	 sibiria / carpii thanks both of yall for the insight
<dniz0r>	greatly appreciated
<carpii>	np, had fun thinking about it :)
<dniz0r>	reading docs right now as to how to getmltitple analaog readings
<sibiria>	if you go with the arduino mini, which is like $3, you can afford a few
<sibiria>	each can handle 6 analog inputs
<carpii>	 np, gluck
<carpii>	anyone had a problem with an lcd display always showing full block characters and not reacting to any data pins?
<nashi>	liquid crystal display display?
<carpii>	character display yea
<carpii>	http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/lcd-16-4-backlight-blue
<carpii>	i get the 1st and 3rd lines full of block characters, and 2nd and 4th lines blank
<carpii>	its all wired correctly, and im using the provided code
<carpii>	so not sure where to go from here :/
<nashi>	there is only one display in lcd, not two.  i dont know whats wrong, but i suspect the data may not be coming in correct
<nashi>	check the waveforms with an oscope if you have one
<carpii>	sadly not :(
<carpii>	logic analyser any use?
<carpii>	but its almost like its wired wrong, since its like that the moment it powers up
<carpii>	and yet ive checked it 10 times at elast
<carpii>	and metered the solder points too
<askpcguy>	is this only for arduino coding questions, or is a question about an arduino based project acceptable?
<chisight>	hardware, software, design, all of the above.
<askpcguy>	fantastic!  i'm looking to use an arduino pro mini 5v to drive a 5050 smd rgb led (ws2811) and wanted to know if there's any great resources for planning power consumption
<askpcguy>	the datasheet said something around 200 mah per channel
<xark>	askpcguy: which datasheet?
<askpcguy>	for the ws2811
<xark>	askpcguy: i think that is dependent on how many you run (and how bright).
<askpcguy>	i believe thats correct, in my project i'm using a single led
<xark>	looks like 5v @ 120ma draw per led (when bright white).
<xark>	with only one. that should be fine for any reasonable power supply (or even non-coin battery).
<askpcguy>	this is going to make a light up lanyard, color cycling for about 6-7 hours over 4 days
<loshki>	askpcguy: where's the power coming from?
<askpcguy>	thats what i'm unsure of, all this is going around my neck =] so as small as possible.  was thinking old cell phone battery provided i could wire up micro usb recharging port
<askpcguy>	hrm wait maybe it was 60 mah per channel
<askpcguy>	found it http://www.adafruit.com/products/1612
<askpcguy>	each pixel draws as much as 60ma (all three rgb leds on for full brightness white
<loshki>	askpcguy: best do your homework and read the neopixel-uberguide doc: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide
<askpcguy>	i've seen that guide loshki, its a product page sort of, my problem is only using 1 led versus a strip
<askpcguy>	right, i found this 3.7v -> 5v step-up circuit on ebay that works with an 18650 cell, if i had two in series i'm guess that would be enough power for the whole 4 days else only 1 but recharge it nightly
<poppavic>	use parallel then
<loshki>	askpcguy: there are detailed code examples in the later pages. i think your single neopixel is basically considered to be a strip of length one.
<tawr>	i've made small neopixel setups (not ribbons)
<askpcguy>	it is loshki i poked the arduino ide around and got something basic running but coding is a complete mystery to my brain haha ...
<tawr>	http://i.imgur.com/kwecoj9l.jpg <- 5 sided dice, neopixel
<tawr>	i like trying to make small circuits
<askpcguy>	those leds look very similar to mine, from a local supplier
<tawr>	they are neopixels mounted on sparkfun 5x5 proto boards
<tawr>	err, 1 proto board, i mean
<askpcguy>	ah i got mine from vetco
<tawr>	adafruit neopixels, but their 'smallest' ones. http://i.imgur.com/u02v0khl.jpg
<garth>	hi, are there any type of single (or very few) component that can do 120vac to 7 to 12v dc (i have some leeway), i'd need 200ma at most (on the dc side)
<tawr>	it was a tight fit, put resistor on the data line and a capacitor on the power rails
<tawr>	garth, and an off the shelf product is out of the question?
<tawr>	it's not a good idea for someone barely getting into electronics to mess with mains power, it's not suggested
<garth>	tawr: i'm fine with off the shelf, i just don't want a big wall wart
<tawr>	the whole electrocution and burning down the house parts, you know
<tawr>	define big? you need .6w of power. 1"x1"x1" cubes (usb ac adapters) can do 5-10w
<poppavic>	<shrug> wallwart or transformer itself - why fight prepackaging?
<askpcguy>	adafruit has an even smaller rgb led tawr, its basically only the square bit
<garth>	yeah i get. i'm no expert, but it won't be my first project that touches the main. i'm mostly unaware of components particular names (besides the basic ones)
<tawr>	the usb power plug was just a suggestion. they're just little dc-dc converters. search amazon or ebay
<tawr>	and you'll get exactly what you weant for a few bucks
<tawr>	you would be hard pressed to come even remotely close in price, and no where close in size versus an off the shelf unit
<tawr>	just type in "ac adapter 12v"
<askpcguy>	check a computer recycle store, pick up an old laptop power brick
<garth>	basically, i've just completed a programmable thermostat for my heatpump/ac (there's no commercial one for it), and on the wall in front of the unit i have a double electrical box with only 1 switch. i was thinking of sticking the arduino with the power source into the space of where the second switch would go, but all the wall wart/power adapters are just too big
<garth>	hence looking into something really compact
<askpcguy>	there's also mini itx power supplies, those are pretty small
<tawr>	you keep calling it a wallwart
<tawr>	those do not exist anymore
<tawr>	we have tiny little dc-dc supplies that weigh 1/20th, are many times more efficient, have clean, regulated output ...
<askpcguy>	the wall wart part got moved in between the device and the wall
<tawr>	not really. look at ac adapters
<tawr>	garth, you do know you can power an arduino off regualted 5v directly right?
<tawr>	instead of putting 7-12v into the arduino from the barrel jack, you can just power it from a usb cable, or directly to the 5v pin
<tawr>	just use a cellphone adapter, the ac -> usb plugs.
<garth>	i know i should say ac adapter, but for some reason wall wart comes out more easily.
<tawr>	go straight 5v, bypass the linear reg that's going to make tons of heat at 12v.
<tawr>	power via usb using stuff you have at your house right now
<tawr>	it will be a much better solution
<tawr>	okay im out, night guys
<askpcguy>	old smart phone chargers for example
<tawr>	^^
<garth>	i forgot about the direct 5v
<askpcguy>	i've got one thats 0.7 a
<askpcguy>	think i found my power pack >> https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8484
<garth>	are cellphone adapter small enough (inside the packaging i guess) to fit with an arduino mini & an rtc circuit (with a backup battery) all inside the space of a switch box?
<poppavic>	here, wallwarts are too passe': http://www.block.eu/en_in/products/electro_transformers/
<askpcguy>	garth:  http://www.ebay.com/itm/oem-original-authentic-samsung-wall-home-travel-charger-and-usb-cable-/161625053239?pt=lh_defaultdomain_0&var=&hash=item25a19a9837
<askpcguy>	and you get a usb cable to hack apart
<garth>	those block transformers are nice
<askpcguy>	the samsung skyrocket has an even smaller one but its 1000 mah out i believe
<poppavic>	http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?pv127=6331&pv1525=182&pv1525=44&fv=fff40042%2cfff80229&mnonly=0&newproducts=0&columnsort=0&page=1&quantity=0&ptm=0&fid=0&pagesize=25
<garth>	nice
<garth>	i guess i could try to get a cheap usb adapter as i know a place i can get them really cheap, but i really like those tiny converter
<garth>	i am wondering, i have a programmable thermostat for my electric baseboards, and i checked inside it (at one point i was hopping i could program some extra stuff in), and i didn't see anything anywhere as big as those converters (apart for the atmega chip)
<garth>	i'm wondering how they power the atmega from the mains
<poppavic>	what??
<poppavic>	they use a wallwart or usb or a battery
<poppavic>	..solar cells.. a potato - magic
<garth>	i was talking about a programmable thermostat for electric baseboards
<poppavic>	thermostats tend to use a long, long wire from a transformer somewhere - ours was nailed next to the breakerbox in the basement
<poppavic>	(actuallly, i bet that powered the built-in smoke-alarm, too)
<chandeepa>	hi all
<chandeepa>	i have a problem with rf24l+ module
<garth>	that one is plugged directly in the 220vac, between the breaker box & the baseboard, there's no transformer
<chandeepa>	anyone to help me?
<chandeepa>	how to solder an antenna to rf24l+ transceiver module? if i do so, will it appreciate the range?
<chandeepa>	heavily- i mean about 1km
<garth>	sorry, don't know what that type of module is. but you might want to check local regulations before deploying something operating over such a range without a license
<chandeepa>	i checked garth, its ok... i want that much range
<garth>	do you have a link to the module information?
<chandeepa>	bunches of them, documentation or whatever the thing you want... which one?
<garth>	more of a general information, to see if it's something i'm familiar with
<chandeepa>	datasheet? ->www.nordicsemi.com/eng/nordic/download_resource/8765/2/27999719
<chandeepa>	the the repository ->https://github.com/stanleyseow/rf24
<garth>	closest thing i'm familiar with, are wifi. and the only way i know to get a wifi in the 1km range, is to using strong signal amplifying antennas, preferably a directional one
<sibiria>	directional dipole antenna can extend wifi range very far without having to go over 100mw effects
<p0g0_>	sibiria: here in the us, the antenna gain is included in the eirp limits.  the 100 mw isn't the thing measured, it is what comes out the antenna.  you can make a p2p 'backbone' that runs well above the 100mw limit though (in the us/fcc).
<sibiria>	or pay for extenders etc.
<sibiria>	but with a waveguide antenna (say, a cantenna) those 100mw that most cards/nations allow can go pretty darn far
<sibiria>	what is the fcc's eirp limit for wifi?
<sibiria>	half a watt?
<nashi>	sibiria: its output signal strength not output power levels. the antenna could be more efficient and the signal would be stronger.
<p0g0_>	sibiria: the fcc's limits vary.  like i said, the point to point backbone has different fcc rules, much higher than the typical one to many levels used by access points.
<sibiria>	nashi: that's what eirp is for - signal strength radiating from the antenna
<sibiria>	in dbm or dbw or whatever is used
<nashi>	signal strengh is *not* measured in watts. you asked for watts.
<sibiria>	i asked for eirp in watts
<p0g0_>	watts, db... they interchange...
<nashi>	no, they don't.
<nashi>	signal strength measured in the air has no "watt" measurement.
<sibiria>	i'm not an expert, but i think the decibel watt disagrees
<nashi>	dbw does not equal watt. there's this thing called decibel, genius.
<nashi>	thats like saying va equals watts. not the same measurement.
<sibiria>	but the dbw is a relative and interchangeable measure
<nashi>	lol
<nashi>	you remind me of this one person who swore up and down that iops and mbps were the same measurement
<sibiria>	those are two completely different things, but correct me if i'm wrong: isn't the dbw a measure of decibel relative to one watt?
<nashi>	im not a friggen teacher, and its 4am here ive had no sleep. if you want to learn what it means, please do so. i dont feel like writing a white paper here.
<nashi>	if it was the same thing they wouldnt be labeling it and measuring it differently.
<sibiria>	no one stated they are the same, just like no one stated inches and centimeters are the same - but conversions can be done
<sibiria>	interchangeable units that can describe one and the same item
<nashi>	wow.... those two measure the same thing this does not
<nashi>	you even said the gain of the antenna changes the capability of the signal.
<nashi>	that cant be factored out to zero. use your head ffs
<sibiria>	that was you who said that, actually. and no, of course it can't be ignored. what i was trying to underline is that what you measure radiating from the antenna in db can be expressed in dbw or watts, which is the unit most often discussed in eirp
<nashi>	<sibiria> but with a waveguide antenna (say, a cantenna) those 100mw that most cards/nations allow can go pretty darn far
<nashi>	really?
<nashi>	youre going to pull that bullshit "i didnbt say that you did" now?
<nashi>	damn troll.
<sibiria>	i interpreted your statement literally
<tazmain>	hi all, does anyone have some code or examples to controll a 4 pin stepper motor ?
<ozzzy>	tazmain, depends on how you want to control it
<tazmain>	erm. okay want i want to do is use an old gpu fan+heatsin on my pi. or have a msp430 control it. being able to set a default or have it increase with temp
<ozzzy>	and you want to use a stepper?
<tazmain>	ozzzy, the fan taking into account that it have 4 pins it prob a stepper motor
<tazmain>	black,red,yelllow and blue calbes.
<ozzzy>	i don't recall ever seeing a stepper fan
<darkuranium>	ditto.
<ozzzy>	4-wire pwm fan perhaps
<darkuranium>	4 pins ... yeah
<darkuranium>	ozzzy, it might be some sort of fan speed feedback
<ozzzy>	yep
<darkuranium>	but i thought that was typically done with 3 pins
<tazmain>	pwm is usually 3 pins
<ozzzy>	http://www.formfactors.org/developer%5cspecs%5crev1_2_public.pdf
<darkuranium>	tazmain, you mean, brushless is usually 3 pins?
<darkuranium>	ozzzy, what's control for?
<darkuranium>	oh, that's for *setting* speed, i guess
<darkuranium>	yeah, i think motherboards use these connectors
<tazmain>	so sense is rpm feedback?
<darkuranium>	yes
<tazmain>	control is then bring the fan up to x rpm ?
<darkuranium>	and control is not necesarilly connected on the motherboard (but it must be on fan side if it has a plug, iirc)
<darkuranium>	(that is, you can plug a 3-pin fan into a 4-pin mobo socket, but not the other way around)
<darkuranium>	(depending on the motherboard, it'll either pwm the 12v signal, or just run at full speed all the time)
<darkuranium>	tazmain, and yes, pretty much
<darkuranium>	cone think of it, control might be directly connected to a fet (but i'm not sure)
<darkuranium>	come*
<tazmain>	okay so is this possible to control such a fan, i will have to give this external power then for the 12v
<darkuranium>	control is usually up to 5v, so just a pwm output should do it
<darkuranium>	that is, 0-5v pwm
<tazmain>	power source will go to the fan and the ground of the power source i assume will also have to go to the control unit so that it have the same reference
<tazmain>	these are 12v brushless fans
<darkuranium>	yes
<darkuranium>	you'll need 5v pwm and 12v power on the same ground
<darkuranium>	(which does not have to be the same ground as the controlling ic --- if you use, say, optocouplers ... assuming those are fast enough for that pwm)
<darkuranium>	i'm guessing it's a fan with a builtin esc
<darkuranium>	tazmain, not counting the control wire, it's probably the *exact* same concept as rc esc and servo connections
<tazmain>	yeah have not done that yet :p
<darkuranium>	ground + <n>-volt power supply + 5v (or 6v in case of rc stuff, but probably not your case) control wire
<tazmain>	just started with c , know a little c++ to get by. i want to just making something to keep my pi really cold
<darkuranium>	lox! it'll be a blast!
<tazmain>	sarcasm? or you mean it will be cool to code it in c , instead of say python as everyone seems to do on a pi ?
<darkuranium>	is yotson a bot?
<yotson>	beep
<darkuranium>	lol
<darkuranium>	yotson, you scared me for a moment, because my ip starts with 77 :p
<yotson>	:)
<darkuranium>	tazmain, yes, that was a joke :p
<darkuranium>	tazmain, lox = liquid oxygen
<tazmain>	oh !
<darkuranium>	tazmain, ... typical use: rocket fuel.
<darkuranium>	hence the "blast" bit :p
<darkuranium>	it *is* cold though.
<tazmain>	yeah well this will keep it cool when it get to 95 degrees outside
<tazmain>	or 32 degrees c depends what you use
<darkuranium>	305.15 kelvin*
<darkuranium>	:p
<darkuranium>	but yeah, i'm from europe, so i use real units.
<tazmain>	hahaha not some units that depended on how large the king was on that stage :po
<darkuranium>	tazmain, well, those units were nice.
<darkuranium>	too large an unix? simple fix: apply axe to king's head.
<darkuranium>	unit*
<tazmain>	lol !
<darkuranium>	and i don't mean picaxe:
<darkuranium>	s/:/./
<darkuranium>	i dunno what's up with my typing today.

<tazmain>	ozzzy, didn't work. i applied power to yellow and black nothing
<airforce590>	is anyone home?
<alexportable>	why
<ozzzy>	tazmain, you have to have all 4 connected
<tazmain>	ozzzy, yeah it needs a pulse on controll or no go
<ozzzy>	the spec is in that pdf
<tazmain>	really ?
<deshipu>	guys, if i wanted to try programming my avrs directly, having some basic understanding of c, is there any tutorial or documentation that you would recommend?
<deshipu>	i know that in theory just reading the datasheet should be enough, but it's not necessarily structured well for learning from scratch
<airforce590>	hey, will someone check a pcb for me?
<airforce590>	the brd and sch files are here. first time using eagle, don't get your hopes up. don't have it routed yet
<airforce590>	https://www.dropbox.com/sh/67gztsvfkcs9odd/aadlnqnqtwvj2z0rs38uxalia?dl=0
<kline>	heh, fair enough
<blathijs>	thanks for pointing it out, though, nice to read it over :-)
<pj_>	has anyone seen such a thing as a breakout board for an arduino? i need an arduino in a small case with a ribbon connector to a breakout board so i can mount it on a breadboard. there is no such thing on ebay-uk. thanx
<phosie>	pj_: something similar to the pi breakout board, but for arduino?
<pj_>	phosie< yup! any ideas?
<phosie>	pj_: no, but now i know what you mean i'll see if i can find anything
<pj_>	phosie< thanx
<phosie>	all i can find is pi things...
<pj_>	phosie< mmmm me too - but thanx anyway
<pj_>	i may have to make one myself
<phosie>	pj_: no problem. if i find anything i'll let you know
<pj_>	phosie< k thanks. mailto:pj@mm.st
<phosie>	pj_:  http://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/3216/breadboard-to-arduino-wiring-with-flat-flex-cable-assemblies best i've found
<pj_>	phosie< interesting. i think i will fashion one like this but bigger and better. thanx anyway
<snath>	i am having a problem with the ide configuration.  i installed the adafruit addons so i could program a trinket and now i can't configure the serial port to program an uno.  help?
<timemage>	snath, "can't" ?
<snath>	the "port" menu item is greyed out
<timemage>	snath, hmm.  what happens if you unpack a second copy of the official ide and run that?
<snath>	i tried with the older 1.0.6 ide that's in another directory tree and it did the same thing.  however, i did see that there is some shared configuration in arduino/...
<snath>	if i have to, i can create another user on my netbook and try that, but i'm trying to avoid it.
<timemage>	snath, should be enough to rename the directory
<snath>	which one?
<timemage>	snath, whatever your shared directory is.  i'm on linux, and i have no idea what you're on.  so i'll leave that to you.  iirc, on windows you'd need to rename the my document/sketchbook directory to prevent it form finding the hardware/ and libraries/ subdirectories.  alternately, rename those subdirectories.  or... on newer versions of the ide (maybe all for all i know), you can change the directory in preferences.
<snath>	i'm on linux (fedora 20) as well
<timemage>	snath, well, when you made your modifications for tricket, what did you do?  i would guess added stuff to hardware directory.
<snath>	 ~/arduino/libraries is shared there is also an .arduino/ directory
<snath>	yeah
<timemage>	snath, right, the latter is where preference are. hang on.
<timemage>	snath, so, even in arduino 1.0.1, you can change the sketchbook directory in preferences.
<snath>	i'm a real beginner with the arduino ecosystem
<timemage>	snath, i don't have a trinket.  the only thing i know about it comes from helping someone figure out how its clock is configured.
<snath>	it doesn't show up as an usb serial port, unlike the uno and a lot of other arduino boards
<timemage>	snath, had you programmed it once already?
<snath>	the uno?  yes.
<snath>	the trinket i got to work a couple of evenings ago
<timemage>	snath, is it plugged in now?
<snath>	yes
<snath>	the uno
<timemage>	snath, can you remove it and the uno and then reinsert the uno.
<snath>	sure
<timemage>	snath, the trinket i knew of used a software usb implementation, and it wouldn't surprise me if it was easily capable of confusing a hub to the point of not recognising other devices.
<snath>	bus 002 device 003: id 0403:6001 future technology devices international, ltd ft232 usb-serial (uart) ic
<snath>	the trinket is disconnected
<timemage>	snath, your uno is a clone?
<snath>	and, i've even done a power cycle of the netbook
<snath>	uno is actually an educato from techshop
<snath>	the serial port shows up and i can echo text out to it and see the leds flicker
<timemage>	snath, and if you ls /dev/ttyusb* you see something that appears/disappeared depending on the uno attached to not, right?
<snath>	yes
<timemage>	snath, if you kill everything using /dev/ttyusb* now and start the ide, it is still grayed out?
<snath>	nothing is using it and restarting the ide hasn't helpd
<timemage>	snath, but you had the trinket in last time or no?
<snath>	no, it has been disconnected for quite a while.
<snath>	the trinket is currently driving a neopixel strip powered by a usb batter pack
<timemage>	snath, okay.  i don't have any ideas different from what you already know to try.  i just suspect that it doesn't have anything to do with trinket.  it would have to be a very strange bug for the extra board definitions to have any effect on whether or not the port shows up.
<snath>	ok, i will have to delve into other possibilities
<loshki>	snath: did we ask which version of the ide you're running, on which os?
<snath>	1.6.4 on fedora 20
<loshki>	snath: tried 1.0.6? i know it's old, but it works for me...
<snath>	yeah, i tried that as well.  didn't help
<snath>	but i didn't try running it as root.  that seems to work.  thanks for the idea
<snath>	i am really disappointed in the linux support for arduino boards.  i am not going to run windows or dedicate a separate system to doing arduino development
<blathijs>	snath: did it work before as not-root? what changed?
<blathijs>	snath: perhaps there is something in your preferences that breaks it, and root has its own preferences. you could try moving the ~/.arduino15 directory out of the way to start with a clean set of preferences to see if that helps?
<snath>	there have been some system updates since then, i haven't been doing any arduino work for a couple of months.  and i wasn't exactly deep into it then.  i'm a beginner
<blathijs>	snath: also, did you say that there is no /dev/ttyusb0 at all, or is it just not shown in the ports menu?
<snath>	there wasn't a ports menu.  it was greyed out
<blathijs>	ah right, that's what i meant. did the /
<blathijs>	 /dev/ttyusb0 file exist?
<snath>	yes, and i can write to it
<blathijs>	did you set up the permissions properly before? are you in the dialout group (and is the group for /dev/ttyusb0 also dialout)?
<deshipu>	also, select the right board...
<blathijs>	deshipu: the ports menu should be shown regardless, right?
<snath>	yes, i'm in the dialout group
<loshki>	snath: time to get rough. run the ide with verbose switched on, and find the avrdude line where it tries to upload the image and run it on the command line.
<snath>	digging further, it seems like a number of people are having this problem and java is throwing an exception on looking for serial ports
<snath>	looking at https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/arduino/?comments=all it appears that the ide is just plain broken because of a missing dependency
<kline>	snath, is there any reason you cant use the arduino.cc release?
<kline>	its a self-contained system
<loshki>	snath: if only that were the only reason the ide is broken...
<kline>	oh wait i misinterpreted the issue
<kline>	ignore me :>
<snath>	i pulled down the tar file
<snath>	i actually have 3 versions of the ide in my home directory.  one of them for the galileo...
<snath>	looks like i'll be able to get by running the 1.0.6 version for programming the uno
<firehopper>	mmmmm rootbeer float..
<poppavic>	whee!
<poppavic>	firehopper:  or a _malted_
<pxian>	hi, is there any arduino boards that can be used to drive a linear ccd such as tcd1304ap?
<xark>	pxian: hmm, maybe on a due or other arm board, but the 8-bit arduinos "suck" at image processing (with only 2k and low-speed 8-bit processor).
<xark>	pxian: other than memory, it doesn't look overly difficult to interface too (from a quick datasheet scan - take that with a grain of salt).
<xark>	hmm, some discussion seems arduino may not be up to it -> https://plus.google.com/+thiagovilla0/posts/acvk7ukqdrk
<pxian>	the camera is pretty small
<pxian>	around 3600 by 1
<pxian>	looks like they recommend the teensy 3.1 for it
<xark>	that does seem a good choice.
<poppavic>	those arm teensy's are cute, and costwise: the cheap chinee mini-maple-like stuff should work, too
<d3jake>	anyone ever use an odbii interface on a vw?
<nicohood>	i try to run arduino ide 1.6.4 for the very first time on ubuntu. do i have to install java 6 or java 7 first?
<nicohood>	the official repository has the old 1.0.5
<xark>	nicohood: i thought it would work with both?  i think i have 8...
<chillsurf>	hi there. i need to ask something irrelevant to arduino but relevante to irc
<nicohood>	xark i have no idea
<nicohood>	i downloaded the ide from the website and got an error
<nicohood>	i am a linux noob to be honest
<chillsurf>	i need you to tell me which irc client you prefer
<nicohood>	but java 8 is not in the software center
<xark>	okay, i am on win7-64
<nicohood>	xark: can you help me with linux?
<xark>	not with specifics, i'm afraid.
<deshipu>	nicohood: i have openjdk-7-jre
<deshipu>	nicohood: on vivid
<nicohood>	the really hard thing with linux is that its not a raspberry pi
<nicohood>	meaning if my os is destroyed its not that funny
<nicohood>	deshipu: xark: installing java fixed it
<xark>	cool
<xark>	nicohood: i know what you mean...
<deshipu>	nicohood: there are two kinds of people
<deshipu>	nicohood: thow who make backups and those who will be making backups
<nicohood>	deshipu: i tried the linux internal backup thing. but i have no permission to write the data to my external drive. probably due to ntfs
<deshipu>	i don't know, i just targzip everything
<nicohood>	i have not checked yet what is the best way to backup my whole linux system. any suggestion? a simple dd?
<nicohood>	xark: my jessie is running perfect. i also have ubuntu mate running on my pi2.
<deshipu>	yay, my robot now properly shuts down its servos on low battery
<deshipu>	i wonder if i could shut down the atmega too somehow
<nicohood>	deshipu: you can put it into sleep mode
<nicohood>	there are different sleep mode
<nicohood>	s
<deshipu>	i need one from which it never wakes up :d
<nicohood>	there are about 5 modes
<nicohood>	i think
<nicohood>	thats interesting. let me know if you find something out about that
<deshipu>	the question is, can i use them from the ide, without writing custom libs
<omar86>	hi all
<omar86>	can someone help me with a midi controller?
<nicohood>	why does the rpi2 has hava8 in the software center and ubuntu on desktop not??
<omar86>	i have this code: http://pastebin.com/emwnrtqv
<deshipu>	sleep_mode_pwr_down \o/
<xark>	nicohood: it was great until the last update && rpi-update.  now some service fails and no login prompt.
<deshipu>	nicohood: because canonical doesn't care
<nicohood>	canonical?
<nicohood>	whats this?
<deshipu>	nicohood: the company that makes ubuntu
<omar86>	i don't understand why i receive a lot of midimessage
<omar86>	i want to receive them only when i change the pot value with a threshold of 8
<omar86>	any idea?
<chillsurf>	omar86: please share the code
<omar86>	http://pastebin.com/emwnrtqv
<omar86>	i think it's related to "control_past[n]" in the for loop that i don't know if it's ok
<omar86>	it's my first time with for loop definition
<gedamo>	omar86: you're talking about the loop at line 110?
<omar86>	yes it is
<gedamo>	why are you using a loop here?
<nicohood>	deshipu: but on the pi is ubuntu mate
<nicohood>	so it should be the same company?
<omar86>	because i want to read one pot's value  at every loop
<nicohood>	its also too bad that they only ship arduino ide 1.0.5
<nicohood>	why dont they update? is it a problem of ubuntu or a problem of arduino.cc?
<gedamo>	omar86: ah, there are multiple pots
<gedamo>	omar86: by the way, instead of having an empty if block you can reverse the condition i.e. if (abs(...) > pot_threshold) ...
<gedamo>	omar86: could it be because control_past is a byte array?
<deshipu>	nicohood: pi has raspbian by default, not ubuntu
<deshipu>	nicohood: it's the problem that they are not getting paid for updating arduino ide
<omar86>	gedamo: it works! i thought that when you have a byte[n] than you have to use a byte array for what is related to
<chandeepa>	hi, what is the maximum baud rate arduino can have via usb port?
<gedamo>	omar86: except analogread returns an int
<omar86>	ah ok!
<chandeepa>	dear me
<deshipu>	0-1024
<omar86>	now if i want to add more pots have i only to modify the n<numberofpots?
<omar86>	in the for loop section?
<chandeepa>	what is the maximum baud rate arduino can have via usb port?
<gedamo>	chandeepa: http://www.arduino.cc/en/serial/begin
<chandeepa>	gedamo hang on
<chandeepa>	gedamo exceeding 115200?
<deshipu>	nicohood: yay, sleep mode works, thanks for the advice!
<deshipu>	chandeepa: try and see?
<chandeepa>	deshipu what happens?
<nicohood>	deshipu: dont they do it for free anyways?
<deshipu>	nicohood: no, not at all
<nicohood>	may you show me the comamnd you used to poower it down? the code
<deshipu>	nicohood: http://paste.sheep.art.pl/2c152732-e337-4654-8272-adcbe7adb8d9/%2binline
<deshipu>	nicohood: lifted from http://playground.arduino.cc/learning/arduinosleepcode
<nicohood>	oh
<nicohood>	looks simple
<deshipu>	because i don't need to wake up
<deshipu>	chandeepa: in the worst case you get mangled data
<nicohood>	deshipu: i alw3ays wanted to test this with my irlremote lib
<chandeepa>	deshipu http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=98364.0
<nicohood>	because the ir sensor could wake it up
<deshipu>	nicohood: ah, have a device that switches on with a remote?
<nicohood>	this would save a lot of power on battery mode
<deshipu>	cool
<nicohood>	sure. then executes the command then then shuts down again
<nicohood>	like turn on a light and power down to sleep
<nicohood>	for example leds dont need permanent updates
<nicohood>	if you dont want any visualization
<nicohood>	switch the color and sleep
<nicohood>	the leds itself take power though
<nicohood>	but you get the idea :d
<iamtrying>	samsung galaxy s5 you have sports app to track running/walking/heart-beat and weight. most of the programmers do not have weight measure linked with this app. how can i read weight measure value and submit automatically via arduino to samsung galaxy s5 sports tracking app?
<zap0>	i just went to the toilet.
<deshipu>	zap0: did you enjoy it?
<zap0>	that's not really the thing i wanted to discuss though ;)    it's the fact that while i was there, i thought, wouldn't it be good if the toilet light had some type of automatic off-switch.
<zap0>	maybe what it needs is one of those push buttons that slowly pops out.
<deshipu>	zap0: many public facilities have that, it's annoying when they switch off when you don't move for some time
<zap0>	or i could build some arduino thingy that turned it off
<deshipu>	they usually have a pir sensor
<zap0>	lucky for us, the toilet and switch are within easy reach, so even if it did go off half way through your 'episode', it would not be a problem, just reach out and press it again
<deshipu>	but that's adding an annoyance for the sake of technology
<chandeepa>	can i connect multiple devices with different functionalities to spi(sck mosi etc) pins simultaneously to arduino?
<zap0>	i don't actually have any of those push buttons on hand, but i have arduino.. so maybe i could hook up one, such that when you go in, and turn the light on, that powers up the arduino, that sets a timer, that then turns off the light after a given time;  you can even have the arduino give you  a count down then!
<deshipu>	chandeepa: yes, but you will need a chip select pin for each
<iamtrying>	well i want to have a weight measure which is connected to arduino and that submits to your mobile app for statistic. but how do i read the weight from analogue or digital weight measures?
<zap0>	iamtrying, piezo
<chandeepa>	deshipu what is a chip select pin, please guide me
<zap0>	iamtrying, they are like $3 at local electronics show.
<zap0>	shop/
<iamtrying>	ok - thank you zap0
<zap0>	iamtrying, i made a drumkit with arduino, some piezos, and blocks of wood.
<iamtrying>	zap0: excellent. well i have few friends and myself. eating junk foods and every week i feel more and more fat because not tracking it. i want to make a weight tracking device which submits every day my weights in my mobile
<iamtrying>	i think i can use the piezo excellent.
<zap0>	iamtrying, i might be wrong.
<zap0>	piezo measures a change in velocity.
<zap0>	it will measure you moving onto the scales, but once there, you might not see a value.
<chandeepa>	i think deshipu is here
<iamtrying>	zap0: then it wont help. what can we use to read the exact body weight values? like today i am 140kg what is my weight tomorrow etc etc
<deshipu>	chandeepa: it's a pin that tells a device that the transmission over spi is directed to it
<zap0>	iamtrying, a day-to-day reading means you want really accurate.   but day-to-day, depending on the weight of food in your stomach is even enough to make that signal "noisy"
<chandeepa>	deshipu can you please suggest me a link where it gives a full guide?
<iamtrying>	zap0: samsung galaxy s5 - measures right now heart-beat, running activity, but it does not have weight measure option
<iamtrying>	zap0: i want arduino to help samsung galaxy s5 apps for weight
<zap0>	just type it in, from regular scales.
<deshipu>	chandeepa: http://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/spi
<deshipu>	chandeepa: see the 'slave select'
<iamtrying>	zap0: no we are lazy we want to make it easy automated.
<chandeepa>	deshipu thanks a lot, can you please remain here until i check this out?
<zap0>	iamtrying, get ocr app.
<deshipu>	chandeepa: i'm not your personal tutor, if i'm not here, someone else will help you
<chandeepa>	ah ok deshipu great
<iamtrying>	ok!!! zap0 that is a nice idea dude!!
<zap0>	also, if you are that lazy, you have an attitude problem.
<iamtrying>	zap0: its not me, i have seen 500 gym going students i want to give them a lazy tool which does automatic
<iamtrying>	ocr is good idea thanks zap0
<zap0>	then make the process of entry 3 characters into a ui fun.
<zap0>	make entering the values a rewarded game.
<iamtrying>	lol zap0
<zap0>	iamtrying, i'm building an exercise bike that is hooked up via arduino to a video.    you have to pedal to watch the video.
<iamtrying>	zap0: scenario 1: a) user1 ( zap0 ) went to gym b) each equipment has a card reader c) zap0 insert his card and start training d) once the card is out submission is done in gym central db
<zap0>	nah... that's so old-skool it smells!
<zap0>	each peice of equipment has a phone holder;   phone emits bluetooth le for user-identification.
<zap0>	then central computer gives real time feedback about progress.
<zap0>	that is what will motivate people.
<zap0>	exercise motivation requires a mental distraction no longer than about 10 to 20 seconds.
<iamtrying>	exactly
<zap0>	that is why "spin classes" are so successful.
<zap0>	it's not about the exercise at all..... it's about having someone distract you constantly so you don't stop doing it.
<iamtrying>	zap0: yes - but also the tracking is important for someone who is very serious about health.
<zap0>	then everyone in the gym, with their phone as the id card.. can also walk away with a pile of stats on their phone to read on the way home, and can feel warm and fuzzy about the experience.
<zap0>	gym/exercise is just the same mental candy as  angry-birds games.
<iamtrying>	yes - the tracking is seriously very important. lazy-ness is our habbit we often do so. but a automated tool will help always to motivate zap0
<zap0>	fact: 99% of gym/exercise equipment bought for the home does not get used because of a lack of feedback from the equipment about progress.    that's a massive potential market to tap.
<iamtrying>	have you seen samsung galaxy s5 sports app? https://shealth.samsung.com/
<iamtrying>	its very handy tool
<zap0>	also fact:  99% of gyms only exist cause they focus on that one problem.
<jeffers>	fact: i made this up
<deshipu>	zap0: i always wondered why those standing bikes don't have a racing game in them, or something
<deshipu>	zap0: it's so obvious
<jeffers>	but yes, gamification goes a long way
<zap0>	deshipu, i would *so play them to death* if they did have racing games in them
<iamtrying>	10,000 steps we need for daily activity. samsung galaxy s5 tracks it well but only the problem it has is that it does not have weight tracking connector device.
<jeffers>	nintendos heading for that sort of market
<zap0>	'weight' is not a measure of fitness.  muscle/fat weigh differently.
<zap0>	the only reason you associate weight with fitness is jenny craig propoganda.
<iamtrying>	zap0: weight is the main key. a slim guy is faster then a fat guy. loosing weight of that fat guy makes it more active.
<iamtrying>	zap0: a tool which alerts a fat guy is always handy for that individual to keep active.
<gedamo>	s/loosing/losing/
<jeffers>	also, remember wii fit did exist.
<iamtrying>	zap0: https://shealth.samsung.com/ > click accessories > they have device already see?
<iamtrying>	how did they made it? and arduino cat?
<iamtrying>	s/cat/cant
<iamtrying>	samsung body scale ei-hs10
<iamtrying>	here : http://www.samsung.com/uk/consumer/mobile-devices/smartphones/smartphone-accessories/ei-hs10nnwegww
<zap0>	im not going anywhere near that stupid web site.... it's so mind bogglingly hispter crap i want to start killing things
<jeffers>	so edgy
<iamtrying>	ok - but technically samsung solved it. but wanted to do with arduino
<zap0>	wtf is that ui on the samsung saying?    "feel more rested"    is this some type of 1984 mind rot?   is it going to brain wash me?    it's like 'keep calm and carry on'..
<zap0>	oh please app...  i'm such a sheep, i even need to be told how to fell.
<zap0>	feel/
<zap0>	i guess no one buys a $1,000 phone anymore cause of features... it's a "lifestyle" choice.
<d3jake>	i'm wanting to tap into the odb ii port on my 1996 vw golf. does anyone know of a resource to tell me what all i can access through itin terms of sensor data?
<yotson>	search the darker corners of the 'net for a workshop/service manual?
<gnawzie>	is it a bad idea to use arduino as charge / power supply controller if external circuitry has protection
<gnawzie>	it will be controlling fets either with pwm or selecting various resistors to control the voltage of a few capacitors that supply power
<chandeepa>	hi
<chandeepa>	why arduino-java serial communication loses some characters at java side
<ozzzy>	?
<chandeepa>	ozzzy when i send some data via serial port to java client application,  sometimes few characters of the string is lost. eg : when i send "test|rxtx|done" it is accepted as "test|rxt" or something like that
<chandeepa>	sometimes
<deshipu>	chandeepa: perhaps you are not waiting for all of the data to come
<deshipu>	chandeepa: the read() doesn't wait
<chandeepa>	i do, i'm using a loop to wait deshipu
<deshipu>	chandeepa: what's the condition in that loop?
<chandeepa>	while (input.available()>0)
<chandeepa>	deshipu
<ozzzy>	why not use serial.available()
<deshipu>	because it's java
<chandeepa>	http://pastebin.com/xkzs4hmh deshipu
<deshipu>	anyways, apparently your loop cycles faster than the arduino can send the characters, and at some point the buffer is empty
<chandeepa>	ah well... solution must be within an special escape character, it will be tricky.. deshipu
<deshipu>	better read until some character, like a newline
<chandeepa>	newline does not work for me, deshipu, when it is accepted by java the \n is removed
<chandeepa>	i tested it using system.print
<deshipu>	nah
<deshipu>	it will work, try it
<chandeepa>	i tried...
<chandeepa>	well let me try threads
<deshipu>	how are threads supposed to help?
<chandeepa>	not the threads giving help, i execute a separate function when the delimiter is found in buffer
<chandeepa>	deshipu tricks works well
<chandeepa>	:)
<deshipu>	awesome
<chandeepa>	fine..... do you know about rf24;+ transceiver modules?
<deshipu>	nope
<deshipu>	well, i know they exist
<chandeepa>	deshipu can you please tell me why that even when the module does not exist in arduino pins, it is notified as it exists? (note : after serial reconnection it is fine)
<deshipu>	no idea
<mr_boo>	i'm working with the "arduino due" with the arduino ide. is there a way to declare arrays in flashmemory so that it doesn't need to be transferred every time i change the sourcecode?
<sibiria>	technically you can flash just part of the memory if you want, and access parts of it with direct adressing, but it's not exactly a convenient process
<chandeepa>	hmm anyway thanks deshipu
<sibiria>	the ide itself doesn't support this. you'd need to flash manually with avrdude
<mr_boo>	i can say that the flashing process is very very slow i'm working with the "arduinthen i would need to know the addresses for the arrays and sourcecode
<sibiria>	or flash the arrays to a static part of the memory and make sure your bootloader + executable portion doesn't tread onto that portion
<sibiria>	either way, it's not really convenient
<sibiria>	you flash 512kb each time?
<mr_boo>	i guess i could hardcode the physical addresses for the arrays and then tell the flasher tool to omit those
<mr_boo>	sibiria: i think it is 512k blocks
<chandeepa>	when i start java client program when rf24l+ module is connected to arduino, the program displays that it is connected without any interruptions. but when i unplug the module during the program(there is a real time interface updater), it is continuosly displayed as connected even the arduino board says it
<chandeepa>	what can i do?
<sibiria>	i'd think the due would have a notably higher rate of programming than the avrs
<mr_boo>	it is really slow i can tell you
<mr_boo>	i think the flasher tool clears everything and rewrites all from the beginning
<mr_boo>	even if only one small change in the entire code is made
<sibiria>	sounds painful
<mr_boo>	thats how it is designed unfortunately
<davido>	http://pastebin.com/l3pdjpr5
<davido>	i copied this code
<davido>	online but am having an error
<davido>	pls can anyone one help me pls
<flok420>	try offering money
<davido>	secondly is it possible to make a sine wave inverter with arduino
<davido>	how much
<sibiria>	as in power inverter?
<gedamo>	davido: it would help if you said what the error was
<davido>	yes pls
<davido>	i know pwm or square wave is possible
<davido>	but not sure of sine wave power inverter with arduino
<davido>	  sine wave power inverter with arduino is it possible?
<kline>	davido, yes

<davido>	how can i make a sine wave power inverter with arduino
<davido>	pls anyone to help
<davido>	how can i make a sine wave power inverter with arduino?
<jeffers>	caps lock for the brave
<davido>	lol
<sibiria>	davido: i suspect you can get better answers in ##electronics, for that particular question
<davido>	k
<sibiria>	you obviously need more than a microcontroller for this
<davido>	k what about getting sine wave out put on arduino
<davido>	k
<sibiria>	only doable with a filter, and it won't be perfect
<sibiria>	the atmega avrs don't have analog outputs
<sibiria>	but you're still only getting tiny currents out of it
<sibiria>	it's not a high voltage/current device
<davido>	yes i can do the electronrics part just the coding side
<sibiria>	davido: google for arduino pwm rc filter
<davido>	on arduino
<sibiria>	that is the simplest solution - but not perfect
<davido>	ok
<davido>	sibiria thanks boss
<sibiria>	basically a low-pass filter on the output
<davido>	k
<davido>	can i send u pm sibiria
<sibiria>	if you want to
<pwillard>	if you &really want analog output... teensy 3.1
<sibiria>	what does the new teensy have? does it have a dac?
<pwillard>	https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensy31.html
<sibiria>	cool
<sibiria>	they really bumped the specs
<pwillard>	i really like use these boards
<smashcat>	hi, i need to drive 26 of these muxes, all connected in parallel ( http://www.vishay.com/docs/70062/dg408.pdf ) from an arduino mega 256. i'm looking at the data sheet and it seems that i should be able to drive them all without using a buffer? does this seem right?
<pwillard>	have you checked the fan-out?  check the avr data sheet.
<sibiria>	26*3 is more than the 50-or-so digital i/os the atmega2560 have
<smashcat>	yep, seems like the fan-out will be fine, after checking :)
<smashcat>	sibiria: all the muxes are driven in parallel - thus 3 pins to drive all of them
<sibiria>	oh in parallel
<sibiria>	yeah that'll do with even the smallest arduino
<pwillard>	fan-out...
<darkelement>	guys what would be something cool to have constantly being sent to the serial port of an arduino? i am trying to think of a way to use that to display a cool live feed of some data, but can't think of any cool things to send to it.
<pwillard>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fan-out
<smashcat>	sibiria: yep, i only need the mega as i need 26 inputs (the analog muxes are taking data from 546 distance sensors, and the mux outputs go into voltage comparitors so i get logic high/low based on a threshold.
<smashcat>	pwillard: yes, i checked the data sheet, and it looks like the fan out for those mux chips from an arduino would be around 1000, so 26 should be ok :)
<sibiria>	with just 10µa per digital input on the mux...
<smashcat>	yep
<sibiria>	won't be a prob
<sibiria>	this was an interesting device: http://www.aliexpress.com/item/latest-mini-camcorders-x009-mini-camera-monitor-video-recorder-sos-gps-dv-gsm-camera-850-900/32232010528.html
<sibiria>	gsm-controlled recording device
<sibiria>	for $16, with free shipping. perfect for paranoid girlfriends/boyfriends
<deshipu>	sibiria: ouch
<sibiria>	i tried coming up with a less trenchant usage scenario but...
<deshipu>	sibiria: the usual excuse is home security
<deshipu>	sibiria: but i can't imagine a burglar that would not also steal it
<sibiria>	yeah it doesn't lend itself to much use as a security item, even if it is very small and concealable
<deshipu>	sibiria: one real-life use case that comes to my mind is for parents who leave their children with a babysitter
<sibiria>	it's definitely a monitoring device
<sibiria>	intriguing price.
<sibiria>	<3 china
<deshipu>	i'd love to have something like the memoto, minus the cloud
<deshipu>	http://getnarrative.com/ <-- this
<deshipu>	basically a photo with gps info every 2 seconds
<deshipu>	just recorded to an sd card
<deshipu>	but i don't like the idea that i can only get at those photos by uploading them to their servers
<sibiria>	easily done with magic lantern (and other alternative digital camera firmware)
<deshipu>	right, it also has to be small
<sibiria>	pocket cameras with gps are scarce, though
<deshipu>	i could probably make one like this myself
<deshipu>	slightly bigger maybe
<deshipu>	hmm, the car cameras sometimes have gps
<smashcat>	would be handy as a device you could put behind a dashboard in a car in case it gets stolen - record the face of the driver maybe
<smashcat>	we're starting to get more and more bulk stuff straight from alibaba now - amazing how much cheaper it is, and delivery in a couple of days from shenzhen.
<smashcat>	(to uk)
<kline>	sibiria: magic lantern considered harmful
<kline>	its not ready for professional use
<smashcat>	example, distance sensors we got were around $25 from all the usual electronic suppliers, but under 8 from alibaba for the exact same item, and it had the connector plug and wire thrown in for each one too! made me think i should start an ebay business buying in bulk from there and selling in small quantities :)))
<smashcat>	do you know any electronics companies near you? they often throw stuff out that's still useable when they replace gear.
<smashcat>	obviously ebay too - look for the slightly older scopes (digital unless you really want analog) that people are selling cheap because they've upgraded?
<firehopper>	he left
<kline>	smashcat: they left
<smashcat>	ah, hahaha! right
<firehopper>	another good place is a local univ. might find good stuff cheap or free
<sibiria>	on the topic of oscilloscopes, i dusted this one off earlier today: https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/10632854_847989121904237_3821625223461397616_n.jpg?oh=b2ee9e29f80ce0abdbafb5a4dc6288e2&oe=55c7e7f7&__gda__=1443357310_9b0583a57269a5cb507438e3bb709521
<sibiria>	russian military edition from the 80s
<sibiria>	been sitting unused for 20 years. still works great
<kline>	sexy as hell
<sibiria>	indeed, combrade
<sibiria>	-b
<kline>	do you speak rusrus? (i see a blue book with cyrillic on the right)
<sibiria>	that's swedish :)
<sibiria>	and the typeface looks like plain times
<zinc>	hey.
<zinc>	do at keyboards generate the clock only when the host/keyboard initiate a send?
<tefad>	i think the input device always generates the clock
<snath>	i really don't like the structure of my code.  i think i would be better off hooking a clock interrupt
<tefad>	however the host can interrupt transmission by pulling the signal low, to which the input device stops transmission. host pulls data low and releases clock, to which the device responds by driving clock again
<tefad>	then host will transmit data using the device clock
<zinc>	with a dmm i'm seeing 0v ac, with momentary jumps when pressing a key.
<zinc>	(on the clock line)
<tefad>	http://www.computer-engineering.org/ps2protocol/
<zinc>	i also checked the ibm docs.
<tefad>	clock is ~10-17khz or so
<zinc>	yeah. wanted to see quickly what it is specifically on some keyboards.
<tefad>	there are ps2 libraries for arduino already out there
<tefad>	not sure if you're nih or what
<zinc>	haven't touched arduino yet.
<nashi>	its weird my newest motherboard doesnt have a floppy port but does have a serial port. at least i have that for electronics.
<flea86>	nashi i would've preferred the floppy port instead of serial.. my view of rs232 has become negative in the wake of weak max232 chippies.. :/
<nashi>	i ordered a couple of them, whats wrong with them?
<flea86>	nashi what brand were they?
<nashi>	no idea. a cheap one >.<
<flea86>	heh
<flea86>	well i've had problems with 3.3v rated rs232 interface drivers
<flea86>	but ymmv
<nashi>	ouch...
<dhrosa>	nashi: what are you trying to do anyway
<nashi>	dhrosa: install floppy drives for direct read/write access on my new computer which has no floppy port.
<dhrosa>	any reason you don't want to buy a floppy-to-usb thingy?
<nashi>	because none of them allow direct read write access to 5.25 and 3.5 drives.
<dhrosa>	ah
<nashi>	yeah
<dhrosa>	what about finding an older computer with an actual floppy port, and talking to that computer over a network or serial?
<dhrosa>	also now that i think about it, the motherboards i've bought in the late 2000s had a connector for a floppy disk drive, though i never installed one
<flea86>	nashi just curious, but does your old comp have a parallel port?
<nashi>	flea86: no.
<nashi>	"old comp"? ive got many i need to work with, and boot off floppy is the only option
<ozzzy>	why on earth would you need a floppy drive
<flea86>	nashi fair enough
<dhrosa>	nashi: what do you need to do on the old computers?
<nashi>	ozzzy: because i work with computers which can only boot from floppy
<dhrosa>	i'm kind of wondering if you could make your own circuit that acted as a virtual floppy
<nashi>	dhrosa: i collect pcs from all eras. and use them.
<dhrosa>	or maybe they make these
<dhrosa>	basically usb-to-floppy in the reverse direction
<nashi>	thats the problem ive never seen any and ive looked. a lot.
<flea86>	nashi: btw, you can add usb to a 5150-xt.. but not as a boot device without hacking the bios - sorry
<flea86>	*pc not xt
<nashi>	flea86: yeah thats kinda my problem.
<nashi>	booting.
<flea86>	yeah, you need a patched bios it looks like
<nashi>	and that's the problem.
<tefad>	nashi: chain boot load
<nashi>	tefad: sorry, wont work for a lot of my things.
<nashi>	ive tried and some of the computers go into seizure when i try
<tefad>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/floppy_disk_hardware_emulator
<tefad>	have you tried that route?
<chisight>	nashi, you can also use a network card with netbooting.  there are even flavors that chain to usb and other solid state media.
<nashi>	erg feeling ill now... ill check this out later. and no, chisight ive tried that even bought a rather expensive old nic with boot bios
<chisight>	what year is the bios of this computer?
<tefad>	1979? : p
<nashi>	aha tefad the problem is no floppy port. that thing requires me to have one to write to the floppy virtuals
<tefad>	mfm supported
<nashi>	chisight: anything from 8088 to early 486
<chisight>	so not a specific machine.
<nashi>	tefad: any mfm controllers will conflict with pata controllers. well known issue, why mfm died so quickly
<tefad>	also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semi-virtual_diskette
<tefad>	i think using tape port wouldn't be too hard, if the machine is old enough
<chisight>	early machines varied greatly but very early disks had an extension bios.  by the time you got to 386, things like pata and netbooting were pretty normal.
<tefad>	nashi: if you have pata access, then why aren't you going the compact flash route?
<nashi>	tefad: if you try that you cannot install to the c: which many many things require.
<nashi>	it messes up a lot of old software.
<nashi>	booting from c: (first pata) and installing to it.... installing to the flash... wont work.
<chisight>	this is a very wide range of machines to try to support with a single solution.
<nashi>	you'd think that.
<nashi>	it doesnt work, sadly.
<chisight>	to use compact flash, you need a bios that handles pata.  early machines didn't have that.
<chisight>	netboot is your most likely broad solution but xt is as far back as that goes.
<tefad>	chisight: he has a moving target it seems
<tefad>	i mentioned mfm and he says it interferes with pata
<chisight>	tefad, yes.  sounds like he's looking for a single solution across too wide a range.
<tefad>	maybe a single solution with multiple modes
<tefad>	but not a one-for-all solution
<dingurt>	i'm working on a car project, trying to interface all the random sensors on my '91 mustang with my arduino... i wanted to use the factory fuel sending unit, which is just a rheostat... how would you suggest i read the resistance if i don't want to supply any voltage (for obvious reasons)
<chisight>	i think the only thing that has the potential to cover everything from 8088/8086 to 486 would be scsi and a real hard drive.
<tefad>	unless you emulate some device via isa that detects the machine it's on and in return emulates a proper device
<ozzzy>	and an 8-bit isa card
<tefad>	^^^
<chisight>	exactly, 8bit isa is the only thing common to the whole range.
<ozzzy>	i wonder if there is a pcie to isa adapter lol
<tefad>	ewwwww
<chisight>	and scsi had extension bios that worked on the whole range too.
<tefad>	nashi: boot from emulated floppy drive (however it can be done) then provide a fresh c: somehow
<chisight>	adaptec 1510, wasn't that 8 bit compatible?  or maybe even further back....
<tefad>	sounds like it might be your best bet
<dingurt>	hey, while you're at it, look for a serial to sata adapter... probably in the same bin
<nashi>	tefad: tried, doesnt work right. tried more than once.
<nashi>	ive tried a whole lot in the last 10 years.
<tefad>	do you have logs of your attempts?
<tefad>	blog, etc?
<nashi>	dingurt: doesnt work.
<dingurt>	nashi: it was a bad joke
<tefad>	nashi: are you a retrocomputing fanatic?
<nashi>	tefad: ive been homeles multiple times, lost all i own, and im very disabled where i take what few things i can do and put energy toward what i wanna do, so no though ive deeply wanted to do a lot of things like that
<nashi>	dingurt: sorry
<nashi>	tefad: no, im an x86 fanatic. i love all x86 hardware.
<chisight>	1510 was "isa - 16 bit" per their site.
<tefad>	nashi: that's fine. at least you can do is leave behind your failures so others don't repeat them
<nashi>	chisight: ive got scsi hardware in my 386 and several others. still doesnt work for my problem
<chisight>	maybe i came too late to your party nashi.  what does scsi not do for you?
<nashi>	tefad: i will if i ever get well enough. since 2001 ive been battling several illnesses one of which is multiple system atrophy which kills 80% of people by year 10 of having it. ive had it since 2001
<tefad>	sucks : |
<nashi>	chisight: i have no floppy controller in my new pc mobo, and i need direct access to 5.25" and 3.5" floppies, write and read.
<tefad>	do your best, keep trucking
<nashi>	tefad: yeah im on disability and living in an adult foster care home. im doing very well considering the prognosis of several of my problems.
<chisight>	nashi, why?
<tefad>	maybe set up a kickstarter and point some of your online friends at it?
<tefad>	or ask a friend to help set it up
<tefad>	something
<tefad>	to acquire the hardware you need
<nashi>	chisight: why what?
<nashi>	tefad: i dont believe in begging.
<tefad>	eh, it's not quite that
<tefad>	you want to spend your time on this
<tefad>	some people would like to have the end result you seek
<nashi>	no, i want to.
<chisight>	nashi, is the goal to read and write floppies from all these platforms for historical purposes or do you have a specific task you're trying to accomplish?
<nashi>	theres this kid that put in a kickstarter to get some video games for himself. no reason, just wants the games. he got the games.
<nashi>	that is so abusing the purpose of kickstarter, and so would me wanting this stuff.
<tefad>	if i can chip in $5 to help you reach that goal, i would be more than happy, but i wouldn't just give you $5 randomly
<nashi>	chisight: to be able to use them
<tefad>	it's not begging if you specify a goal that isn't self centered
<nashi>	tefad: i dont want your $5 either way. not being stuck up, just dont want 'favors' like that.
<tefad>	anyway, that's all i've really got to say about that
<nashi>	but this purpose is most definitely self centered, its something i want to do. which is why it would be begging.
<tefad>	okay. what is your goal?
<chisight>	nashi, not really following your goal here either.  "use" them is too generic.
<nashi>	chisight: use them. for what they were originally designed for.
<nashi>	honestly. it is that generic.
<nashi>	use them with period accurate software.
<tefad>	to be able to run the old software on the original hardware using modern technology to replace that which is too old an unreliable?
<nashi>	nope
<chisight>	nashi, so this is for history?
<nashi>	getting the old software onto them.
<tefad>	eg replace mechanical drives with solid state drives when possible?
<nashi>	nope, for my wants.
<nashi>	nope.
<nashi>	using period accurate hardware.
<tefad>	so how does #arduino fit into this picture?
<nashi>	i dont know, things kinda derailed horribly.
<tefad>	lol, okay
<tefad>	if you want to read and write 3.5" floppies on modern hardware, you probably want a usb ls-120 drive
<chisight>	yeah.  giving up.
<nashi>	that wont let me use 5.25" drives.
<tefad>	if not a standard usb floppy drive
<tefad>	nope.
<nashi>	i have those. work well for 3.5
<chisight>	but there were no 3.5" floppies for most of the hardware range listed.  5.25" was current.
<nashi>	bingo
<chisight>	the obvious solution is to use a real floppy and a real floppy controller if you have floppy software that you want to run on antique hardware.
<nashi>	and getting it onto those is the problem.
<chisight>	finding them?
<tefad>	you're not going to find a usb 5.25" solution
<nashi>	getting the software onto the disks.
<tefad>	at least one that allows writing
<nashi>	im not looking for one.
<tefad>	okay. what are you wanting then
<nashi>	an interface that allows native writing and reading to floppy drives via their native floppy interface on my new system which has no floppy port.
<tefad>	usb is probably your best bet and one doesn't exist
<chisight>	hold it... new system?
<tefad>	i see where arduino might fit in here
<nashi>	yes, new system. i had a quad core 3.6ghz but that one doesnt use ddr3 and i was sick of 8gb limit
<tefad>	you might be able to get something to read a disk image from sd card and write it to 5.25 floppy
<dingurt>	tefad: http://www.deviceside.com/fc5025.html
<tefad>	dingurt: read only
<nashi>	an intermediary, what i want is without an intermediary. im using an intermediary now.
<chisight>	ok.   if you have modern hardware then the solution is floppy images.
<tefad>	to what end?
<nashi>	an arduino may be able to bitbang floppy, but i dont know it well enough to do that. im going to try.
<tefad>	why do you need direct access to 5.25 floppy?
<nashi>	chisight: to what end?  where do i write them to the system
<nashi>	to the drive.
<tefad>	your os is probably not going to support it
<tefad>	best to stick with images and then write out the image
<nashi>	actually win 8.1 supports floppies fine.
<nashi>	on what?
<nashi>	thats the problem im trying to solve.
<tefad>	yeah but you're going to run into difficulties getting the arduino to be recognized as a 5.25" floppy
<chisight>	forget physical hardware.  virtual is the way to go.
<dingurt>	tefad: ok, this one allows write: http://www.kryoflux.com/
<dingurt>	probably a bit complex though
<tefad>	dingurt: how many money is that?
<nashi>	dingurt: it only works with images, not direct access
<dingurt>	tefad: lol, nobody said anything about money
<tefad>	at least 100 euro
<tefad>	well appox
<tefad>	nashi: it will take a lot of effort to do what you're trying to do
<dingurt>	i mean, if you are desperate for your 1985 collection of 8-bit porn, then it may be worth it
<nashi>	tefad: i know this now.
<tefad>	dingurt: hey hey, be nice : p
<dingurt>	lol
<nashi>	dingurt: what the hell are you talking about?
<tefad>	he's trying to write 5.25" for his ancient xt
<dingurt>	nashi: the cost of the usb 5.25 controller
<nashi>	she.
<tefad>	without a middle layer
<tefad>	she?
<nashi>	she.
<chisight>	nashi, is it correct that you actually have a bunch of antique hardware there?  things like ibm xt clones to 486 clones?  with working floppy drives and you want to run the software on your modern hardware?
<tefad>	excuse me. you should have spoken up sooner : |
<nashi>	no chisight
<nashi>	the opposite.
<nashi>	tefad: i tried that and i got tons of bullshit misogynism and trolling in ##electronics for hours
<chisight>	nashi, tell us the whole story.
<nashi>	which is finally starting to die down
<nashi>	chisight: i have a collection of x86 hardware from modern to 8088. i want to transfer software directly to boot floppies in order to be able to boot the old systems with them. some are 5.25" drives.
<nashi>	i need direct hardware access in order to do this, as in like those old ones have, on my new pc.
<tefad>	nashi: why is the direct acces necessary? convenience?
<nashi>	i had a quad core pc that had a floppy port and just upgraded.
<chisight>	nashi, do the floppy drives on these antiques work?
<nashi>	tefad: so i can work directly with the floppy disks and write the files.
<nashi>	chisight: yes
<tefad>	chisight: i think that is beside the point here
<nashi>	they are not antiques, either.
<nashi>	antiques have a cutoff date, and the 80s are far beyond that category
<dingurt>	nashi: if they work, can't you use a null modem cable and minicom, telex or something of the sort just to transfer the data?
<tefad>	i consider anything older than 25 years to be antique
<nashi>	you are technically inacurate, but thats pretty popular view so *shrug*
<tefad>	i think convenience is a factor here
<nashi>	dingurt: no. some of them just freak on it.
<dingurt>	nashi: what freaks, the modern machine, or the old one?
<tefad>	in my state, cars over the age of 25 are eligible for antique plates : d
<nashi>	im trying to avoid having to have an intermediary system to write to them with.
<tefad>	old one
<nashi>	dingurt: the old one.
<tefad>	nashi: this is all for convenience?
<chisight>	mine too tefad.  and computers age faster.
<tefad>	or for accuracy...
<nashi>	tefad: what "all" do you mean
<dingurt>	nashi: that really doesn't make any sense... i transferred lots of stuff that way back in the day
<tefad>	all, the direct floppy writing
<dingurt>	it's just serial
<nashi>	good. i did too.
<tefad>	why can't you pass an image to an intermediary?
<chisight>	tefad, i think he doesn't want a solution.
<tefad>	she.
<nashi>	i can and thats what i do now. the problem isnt with images. the problem is with having to have yet another pc around just to do this.
<chisight>	he wants his solution.
<tefad>	her
<tefad>	dude
<nashi>	chisight: you are spewing bullshit because.... no, i am a she you idiot.
<dingurt>	nashi: you'll need another pc around with a 5.25 controller too
<chisight>	fine, her.
<tefad>	okay
<chisight>	gender doesn't matter here.
<nashi>	because what i want is a way around having an extra pc around i dont want.
<nashi>	yes, it does, chisight when you call me the wrong pronoun its disrespectful
<chisight>	finally, a goal!
<tefad>	(chisight: it can get annoying at times being refered to as the other gender)
<chisight>	"what i want is a way around having an extra pc around i dont want."
<dingurt>	i'm confused...
<nashi>	i told you from the start chisight i dont want an intermediary
<nashi>	you missed it or intentionally ignored it several times.
<poppavic>	i prefer 'it'. "it" insults everyone equally - they may then argue about "it".
<tefad>	and if the intermediary is an ardiuno?
<dingurt>	so get an isa nic and call it a day
<tefad>	dingurt: not all software reacts the same way to that
<nashi>	i have several. none with a boot rom. those are nearly impossible to find, dingurt
<nashi>	and some freak on that, too
<timemage>	poppavic, and it gives you an excuse to speak like gollum.
<chisight>	nashi, this is the very first time i got that eliminating a machine was a goal.  still not even sure which machine that is but assuming the old one is the one that should go away.
<dingurt>	just to transfer the data to the pc with a working 5.25, it would be fine... once the data is transferred, you won't need it anymore
<poppavic>	timemage:  yeeessss... my precccciousss..
<nashi>	chisight: ive been saying that for quite a while.
<nashi>	dingurt: im doing work with that stuff a lot. not just once ever.
<nashi>	for example i just acquired dos 6.20 disks, but they are 3.5" and i want 5.25" version
<dingurt>	what os do you want to run on this machine?
<chisight>	so...  you have an old machine with read/write floppy.  that means data is accessible.
<nashi>	what os do i run on which machine?
<dingurt>	old one
<nashi>	chisight: on the old box. the new one is the problem.
<nashi>	so i cant get new stuff onto it without it.
<nashi>	onto the old one
<nashi>	new stuff being stuff i just acquired
<chisight>	nashi, the new one doesn't matter...  you can run a modern os like linux and emulate your old machine in it and emulate the floppy drive too.  read and write.
<nashi>	recently found the non shareware version of pkzip for example.
<dingurt>	pkz204g.exe
<nashi>	emulate? that never gets it to real media.
<nashi>	dingurt: thats the shareware version.
<dingurt>	nashi: yeah, some things you just never forget..
<tefad>	nashi wants access to 5.25" from a legacy free pc
<chisight>	nashi, what is the reason for going to real media?
<nashi>	ive told you that about three times now.
<tefad>	real media is for era-accurate authenticity
<tefad>	pay attention.
<dingurt>	^^
<chisight>	right,  because her modern machine is so era accurate.
<tefad>	that is the point
<tefad>	she wants the machine to be backward compatible
<dingurt>	what exactly freaks out when you use a null modem cable?
<tefad>	but currently there's no easy way to do it
<nashi>	wow. trolling now because you dont want to do what i do
<nashi>	dingurt: some of the old hardware does.
<nashi>	not all of it
<tefad>	i'm going to assume some of the software is more tolerant than others as well
<nashi>	yes.
<tefad>	but you want something reliable and consistent
<nashi>	and the real stuff is the closest thing to that.
<tefad>	which the floppy provides, given that the media and drive also fit the criteria ; )
<nashi>	because it was designed to work on it.
<dingurt>	ok, so let's recap... you want to transfer data to a 5.25" floppy disk which is essentially impossible with modern equipment. realistically, the only way is going to be to get the data to your old machine and copy it over. correct?
<nashi>	its not impossible. wow.
<nashi>	i'm done.
<dingurt>	nashi: what hardware will you use then?
<tefad>	it's not impossible, just a pain in the ass
<dingurt>	ok, impossible was the wrong word
<nashi>	seriously dude i was trying to get advice that i may have not thought of and instead i get treated like shit for my efforts.
<dingurt>	it's not the direction
<nashi>	because what i want apparently isnt popular
<chisight>	tefad, yeah.  there are far easier solutions here.  but what she wants probably is possible.
<dingurt>	nashi: who is treating you like shit?
<nashi>	you, for one.
<tefad>	nashi: there's some miscommunication here
<dingurt>	?
<dingurt>	how?
<flea86>	nashi have you tried asking your q in #classicmp?
<tefad>	some people here are more brash than others perhaps
<nashi>	ive never heard of that channel before flea86
<flea86>	er, classiccmp
<dingurt>	nashi: if i came off like an asshole, i'm sorry... don't really know when i did, but whatever yo
<flea86>	nashi: try #classiccmp
<nashi>	thanks flea86
<flea86>	np
<dingurt>	good luck with your trs-80
<tefad>	nashi: www.kryoflux.com looks like your best bet
<dingurt>	as i said before
<tefad>	i'm not sure how well it integrates into the os, but it seems to have good gui software
<tefad>	free for personal/non-commercial use
<nashi>	tefad: thats images only, not direct access.
<tefad>	then you are at an impass
<dingurt>	^^
<tefad>	impasse even
<tefad>	you will need to learn how to use usb on an arduino, emulate a floppy drive to the pc, and translate the emulation to a real floppy drive.
<tefad>	more of a translation layer
<tefad>	i don't think there's a ready-made solution to your problem
<tefad>	good luck : d
<timemage>	tefad, i have a stalled project do allow modern pcs to access floppy hardware. rather than emulate the usb interface i was considering emulating the serial version of the sdcard interface.  it would look a bit ugly, where you'd have this adapter shoved in an sdcard reader, which would connect to a module that has the floppy ribbon coming out of it.  but, wasn't going for pretty =)
<dingurt>	function > form
<tefad>	timemage: ha, nice
<timemage>	tefad, i've redrawn the board a couple times, but that's about as far as i've gotten.
<akashiclegend>	if i have a negative drop across a diode does that mean it's reverse biased?
<timemage>	akashiclegend, has as much to do with where your probes are and what if anything else is also in the circuit.
<akashiclegend>	i just did a transient time domain analysis on a simulator
<akashiclegend>	just a simple rc circuit with 2 capacitors
<akashiclegend>	i assume the probes are automatically connected + to anode
<akashiclegend>	and - to cathode
<timemage>	akashiclegend, not really sure how explain.  if you have current flowing in a diode from the annode to the cathode, you're going to see the "forward drop" as a positive number if you put the positive probe on the annode and the negative probe on the cathode.  a number of around .2 to .8 usually.
<akashiclegend>	basically i wanted to make it so that the longer the button is pressed the lower the led's brightness
<akashiclegend>	so i took a graph of the voltage across the led from 0ms to 250 ms
<akashiclegend>	i noticed the voltage decreasing the longer the button was pressed but eventually it went to negative voltage
<akashiclegend>	i was wondering if that negative voltage meant the led was off and reversed biased
<timemage>	akashiclegend, i guess i'd need to see the schematic to make sense of what you're asking/saying.
<akashiclegend>	ok one second
<akashiclegend>	http://tinypic.com/r/i522b7/8
<timemage>	akashiclegend, and you're measuing voltage at the point below the diode?
<akashiclegend>	point above
<timemage>	akashiclegend, weird.  well, in any case what you have is kind of strange.  if you press the button, what you'll do is change the capacitor through your led and resistor. if the components were ideal, once the capacitor had charged the action would stop.   you'd have to manually discharge it.
<akashiclegend>	so the led would turn off?
<akashiclegend>	or have 0 voltage
<timemage>	akashiclegend, yes.  say you have no charge in the capacitor.  when you close the switch, the voltage accross the capacitor would be zero at that moment.  current beings flowing in your led and resistor and the voltage betwene the capacitor and ground should climb
<akashiclegend>	yeah that's what i'm trying to do
<akashiclegend>	didn't you read what i said earlier
<timemage>	akashiclegend, it should climb slower and slower until the voltage at the top of the capacitor is your voltage source minus your led forward drop
<akashiclegend>	i want the capacitor to charge up slowly
<akashiclegend>	and make the led get dimmer
<timemage>	akashiclegend, i did, but the circuit looks a bit insane.  so, forgive me for thinking this is not exactly what you intended.
<akashiclegend>	hah
<akashiclegend>	how would you recommend i improve it
<akashiclegend>	though since i am insane kind of guy i think this matches me
<timemage>	akashiclegend, you also mentioned you were testing the point above the diode.  that's going to be essentially floating initially.  when you press the button 9v, and then in theory it stays at 9v.  in reality, it would slowly drop.
<timemage>	akashiclegend, stays when you release the button that is.
<akashiclegend>	sounds like it works the way i want to
<akashiclegend>	i'll probably build it tomorrow to check
<timemage>	akashiclegend, heh, okay.
<akashiclegend>	my mom wants me take care of this apple tv crap for her. mother's day technically passed
<akashiclegend>	but i figured since i usually troll i might as well do something good
<akashiclegend>	thanks
<timemage>	akashiclegend, not sure where your negative voltage would come from then.   some of the spice simulators show current according to the direction of the component, which applies to resistors as well (as odd as that may seem). so.... if you were seeing something negative it could have been the current through your resistor symbol.  if you rotate it in place, it would flip the sign.
<timemage>	akashiclegend, put a high valued resistor in parallel with your diode---resistor--cap,  say 1 megohm.
<akashiclegend>	ok any reasons why i'm doing this
<timemage>	akashiclegend, it's shouldn't be significant enough to affect your simulation much, but it may help the simulator.
<akashiclegend>	oh i see
<timemage>	akashiclegend, well, i redrew your diagram in ltspice as best as i could.  and it didn't show much when the switch was pressed, but like i said when it is, that node is more or less floating.  so, i made it no flot with a very weak pulldown.  that kind of crap happens a lot in simulators.
<chisight>	sometimes the components are a bit too ideal.
<akashiclegend>	that makes sense.
<akashiclegend>	i think in the future i will try to simulate without floating components.
<timemage>	akashiclegend, it is now showing a simulation results that don't look crazy.  i get about 9ma at the instant of press and it tappers to 1ma over the course of a about tenth of a second.
<akashiclegend>	sounds good to me. thanks.
<timemage>	akashiclegend, oh, well, the numbers i just gave are going to be off.  when i was troubleshooting i replaced the led with a sketchy diode and i hadn't gone back and swapped it back.
<zapduino>	jello
<flea86>	yes pls
<flea86>	}:a
<zapduino>	:d
<zapduino>	i have 5 gallon bucket of the green kind
<zapduino>	i only make jello in paint buckets now
<flea86>	that's more than enough for everyone in the channel lol
<zapduino>	or for pool wrestling match :d
<chisight>	there's always room for mud wrestling.
<zapduino>	:d
<flea86>	lol
<timemage>	akashiclegend, not surprisingly the current dropped a fair bit.  closer like 6ma initially. the diode model seems to be using around 3v for forward.
<zapduino>	theseven: im me
<akashiclegend>	you're making me excited to build it myself.
<zapduino>	remeber shake it more than once, and you playing with it
<chisight>	we're all adults here.  so?
<zapduino>	:d hardly, there might be some kiddos around
<chisight>	yeah, there probably are.
<zapduino>	how you do chisight?
<chisight>	hi zapduino.  was a good weekend.  got to see mom for mothers day.  you?
<zapduino>	my wife bring all mothers together... it was order out of chaos... there was horderves, fruit cakes, and insults
<chisight>	eek, i can't imagine all my mother's together.  i think the last time it happened was my wedding.
<zapduino>	is femme battle of the fittest
<chisight>	they were all on their best behavior.  that doesn't happen often.  lol
<zapduino>	lucky
<zapduino>	only time my wife mother behaves is if i'm not there
<zapduino>	else, i become punching bag for the clan
<zapduino>	happy mother's day to you hacker moms!!
<chisight>	sounds like you need to hide when the motherinlaw comes around. :-(
<zapduino>	no where to hide... :(
<chisight>	out of state?
<zapduino>	wifey holds all my identities, credit cards, passports, and she puts out the clothes i use for the day, the rest of my stuff is locked.
<chisight>	2 of my 4 moms live out of state.  a 3rd is seriously considering moving.
<chisight>	ouch zapduino.
<nashi>	wish i could be a mom. blech.
<zapduino>	your wife not do this?
<chisight>	zapduino, my wife is very cool.
<zapduino>	you very lucky :(
<chisight>	fortunately, i am.  been together over half her life now.
<zapduino>	:)
<zapduino>	i think i only one that suffers... she sais she not want me to leave like other 4 husbands
<chisight>	your dns makes it look like you're near.  we're both on cicril.
<zapduino>	me?
<chisight>	yeah.
<zapduino>	i'm in chicago
<chisight>	i'm a far north burb of chicago
<zapduino>	cool... i live on northside, close to lincolnwood
<chisight>	i'm way way north.  libertyville.
<zapduino>	ah... the end of northwest line
<zapduino>	cool
<zapduino>	we are close :d
<chisight>	nw line goes to harvard.  this is md-n line.
<zapduino>	ah indeed
<chisight>	are you a member down at ps1?
<zapduino>	no, i was going to join, im me we talk there
<davidmemo>	hi
<davidmemo>	i am new to arduino
<zapduino>	hi davidmemo
<davidmemo>	out of curiosity, why don’t people use a small android phone but need arduino? zapduino
<zapduino>	davidmemo: well that all depends on what you are trying to do
<davidmemo>	zapduino: i want to make my customized drone
<zapduino>	arduino + microcontroller technology is better at real time functions
<timemage>	davidmemo, you mean, why is one not a substitute for the other?
<davidmemo>	e.g. should people use arduino or android phone to replace a bulky pc inside an information kiosk?
<nashi>	arduino doesnt have enough horsepower to drive a high res lcd screen.
<zapduino>	davidmemo: in your drone i would use arduino to control the motor controllers, or any other hardware, and use an android computer to send commands to the arduino.
<davidmemo>	nashi: zapduino thanks!
<davidmemo>	i am still reading what arduino can do in its official site
<nashi>	davidmemo: the arduino is limited in power/speed, but its great for low demand tasks
<zapduino>	i wouldn't call them low demand tasks... its better for time intensive commands
<davidmemo>	nashi: such as waching machine?
<davidmemo>	*washing
<nashi>	yes, thatd be great
<davidmemo>	compared with pi berry, what’s the diff?
<zapduino>	pi still uses an operating system, and some hardware doesn't like that it has to wait for the operating system
<davidmemo>	zapduino: is arduino more similar to vhdl sruff?
<zapduino>	no
<zapduino>	arduino is a framework for small processors
<zapduino>	vhdl is a totally different thing, although in the same scope
<chandeepa>	does available method in http://maniacbug.github.io/rf24/classrf24.html rf24l+ library conflicts with arduino serial.available??
<davidmemo>	zapduino: but can i write a small c program and install it into zapduino to receive signals from photo diode ?
<chisight>	chandeepa, there shouldn't be any conflict between maniacbug's lib and serial.available().
<zapduino>	davidmemo: yes, you may
<chandeepa>	chisight but when i check available in rf24 library and use printf to print the read buffer, it sometimes print data in serial output which has been not printed but in a different consequence to be printed
<chisight>	chandeepa, ahh.  let me guess... base 10 numbers... right?
<chandeepa>	base nos for what? chisight
<chandeepa>	rf?
<chisight>	that are ending up both places.
<chandeepa>	chisight i didnt get it, what decides that in rf24
<chandeepa>	and arduino
<chisight>	chandeepa, i'm wondering if both are using the same buffer for converting numbers and that's conflicting.  it's just a random guess.
<chisight>	i use a different library for my nrf24.
<chandeepa>	i send something got to the receiving module, but it prints #rxtx...ah well...let me check again. i think i am closer
<chandeepa>	printf and serial has two bases right?
<chisight>	they should be using different streams, yes.
<chandeepa>	and radio.read() reads according to something in printf library? chisight?
<chisight>	radio.read shouldn't touch the printf library  at all.
<chandeepa>	but when i print the data from radio.read() pointer it does print another content which is found in some other part in the sketch. (printed via serial)
<chisight>	hmmm.  now it's sounding like crossed pointers somewhere.  it's a bit late here for me to get into something like that.  i'm sleepy.
<chandeepa>	hm.... any methods of converting those?
<chisight>	just track down your pointer problem is all.  no tricks, just searching for the bug.
<chandeepa>	let me check again
<chisight>	chandeepa, i'll be around pretty much all day tomorrow.  might be better to look then if you still need help.
<chandeepa>	hm ok... i'm still trying to check, but the buffer displays something apart
<chandeepa>	buffer displays what is last sent via the seral
<chandeepa>	*serial
<chandeepa>	how to find the base used in rf24
<chisight>	not sure what you mean by base.
<chandeepa>	no no... i'll check
<chisight>	ok.  talk to you tomorrow chandeepa.  goodnight.
<chandeepa>	ok  bye and thanks for help chisight
<chandeepa>	here its morning
<chandeepa>	so good morning
<chandeepa>	:d
<chisight>	good morning to you too.  around 8 or 9 hours then. ;-)
<chandeepa>	its 11.50am here
<inchoate3>	anyone awake?
<snath>	unfortunately
<snath>	insomnia is quite annoying
<inchoate3>	tell me about it.
<snath>	but i did just remember to order some button cells
<inchoate3>	started some new  meds andthey apparently have drawbacks
<inchoate3>	whats your project?
<snath>	yeah, i gave up on meds
<snath>	playing around with navigation.  button cell is clock backup on the adafruit gps module
<inchoate3>	cool.  i am so not there yet.
<snath>	looks like the library code is huge.  can't use an adafruit trinket
<inchoate3>	id imagine so.
<snath>	i wouldn't, but the last time i worked with nav code was in the 1980s.  omega was cool
<inchoate3>	how'd you end up doing that?  military?
<snath>	fit a lot more functionality in a lot less memory
<inchoate3>	i guess its all relative there.
<snath>	some military, some commercial.  there were some real wizards at tracor navigation
<inchoate3>	i've always been more of a script kiddie, so im just trying to take it from square one instead of pasting  from an instructable and whatnot.
<snath>	no microcontroller. just a bunch of 74 series ttl
<inchoate3>	tracor?  those guys were huge
<snath>	yeah
<snath>	early 80s
<inchoate3>	i cant imagine.  from what ive read back en it was more of a build-from-scratch situation if you wantd to do anying in computing.
<snath>	lots of assembly language
<inchoate3>	born in 87 means i'm pretty spoiled
<inchoate3>	ooph
<inchoate3>	any advice as far as approaching learning this platform?
<snath>	the ide is c++.  lots of good tutorials on the adafruit website.
<snath>	pick something to build
<inchoate3>	is automatd irrigation too ambitious for an early project?
<snath>	neopixels are fun.  lots of blinky lights
<snath>	for a small garden?  probably not too large
<snath>	lots of readily available parts
<inchoate3>	awesome.  i have a raised bed i want to automate by winter
<inchoate3>	and a box of atmega328p-pu's
<snath>	weather proofing is probably the biggest concern
<snath>	the arduino form factor and shields make putting stuff together a lot easier
<deshipu>	i prefer the pro mini form factor, tbh
<deshipu>	or teensy
<deshipu>	shame they can't agree on the pin layout
<inchoate3>	i ess most projects dont need so many pins.
<deshipu>	i need all of them :d
<snath>	being able to plug the shields together and use existing libraries make it a lot easier to get started
<inchoate3>	yeah i have an uno for prototyping but i want to mess w/board design for the final unit
<snath>	good idea.  i'm doing something similar.  make it work first
<snath>	usb battery packs are also really useful for powering projects.  cheaper to buy than build
<inchoate3>	i guess i have a longway to go.  so that gps project; what kind of form factor do you thinkyou'll go with?
<snath>	right now everything is plugged into a proto board
<inchoate3>	yeah, i have a couple sitti around and one i made that accepts 9v alkaline
<inchoate3>	yeah, but do you have a goal in mind?
<snath>	navigation unit
<inchoate3>	if i still had my old jeep cj i'd want to rig something in the dash like that
<inchoate3>	well, good luck with it, i'm off
<inchoate3>	adios
<drakhu>	guys, anyone has idea what coul i build as a birthday present for my gf? using arduino ofc.
<joey8>	a bf ? :¬)
<zapduino>	drakhu: blinky heart
<drakhu>	joey8: ;d she uses natural one
<icepic>	those wearable things
<icepic>	lilypads
<drakhu>	i was looking for sth using leds, i think that sth more 'effective' would be better than 'practical', as a gift
<drakhu>	honestly i dont think that she would wear anything of those, not that kind (:
<drakhu>	im checking thingiverse and forums, but i didnt found anything yet
<drakhu>	instructables*
<deshipu>	drakhu: electronic pet?
<deshipu>	drakhu: as in, a stuffed toy that purrs when you pet it, for instance
<deshipu>	and maybe makes other sounds
<drakhu>	deshipu: sounds great
<deshipu>	drakhu: there was a howto on adafruit
<deshipu>	https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-trinket-modded-stuffed-animal/overview
<drakhu>	deshipu: thanks :)
<drakhu>	i'll add sth, adn that would be great
<deshipu>	i have a project for a pair of pets, connected to wifi, when you pet one of them, the other wakes up and barks
<deshipu>	nice for long-range relationships
<joey8>	aaaaaw
<drakhu>	deshipu: nice :)
<deshipu>	but it's kinda put on hold, as i'm moving in with my gf :)
<deshipu>	you can use a simple capacitive touch sensor to detect pettig
<deshipu>	like furbies do
<drakhu>	i think i would also hide a camera in my gf's pet
<drakhu>	:)
<zapduino>	hide a camera in your gf pet?
<drakhu>	yeah
<drakhu>	but that was a joke
<doge32>	yo
<doge32>	how do i add usb flashing functionality to an atmega?
<joey8>	drakhu< how about a mix-tape on an arduino
<theseven>	zapduino: still there?
<zapduino>	theseven: yes, im me
<[syntax]>	youd think it would be easy to find cheap tiny usb flash drives..
<[syntax]>	like 512mb or 1gb, but i cant find any for much less than what i can buy a 8gb for
<joey8>	i have a couple of 256mb if you want them
<zapduino>	supply and demand
<[syntax]>	ive needed them a few times and couldnt find them..
<[syntax]>	right now i have a programmable camera tripod for panoramic photography and stuff like that..
<[syntax]>	it requires a 1k file on a flash drive
<[syntax]>	and you either have to rename a pile of files on the drive each time you need to load a different script or carry a pile of drives
<[syntax]>	ive also wanted to use them in geocaches in the past, small drive is less likely to get stolen
<[syntax]>	just found some 512mb for $2 on ebay
<[syntax]>	1gb drives are $2.60
<[syntax]>	heh
<[syntax]>	512mb is $2.25
<oddalot>	for some reason that reminds me of a 'you suck at photoshop' episode
<oddalot>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2u_yn-eyhg
<[syntax]>	heh oddalot. yeah kinda.. stitching photos and flash drives
<chandeepa>	does anyone know how to have both rf24l+ receipt and transmission code in single sketch
<chandeepa>	?
<chandeepa>	note : first the board must receive and then it should transmit in one loop cycle
<chandeepa>	anyone?
<[syntax]>	no idea on that.. never used those functions before..
<chandeepa>	syntax are you familiar with rf24;+
<chandeepa>	*rf24l+
<[syntax]>	nope
<chandeepa>	anyone you know?
<joey8>	i know somebody who does
<chandeepa>	joey8 im done
<alexportable>	 if i have an arduino, will dupont jumper wires fit and work?
<pwillard>	yes
<deshipu>	yes, just make sure you get the right gender
<icepic>	when i started with arduino, it took me a while to figure out that dupont cables was what i was looking for, knew the idea but not the name of them
<pwillard>	it's sort of a name they picked up over time...
<alexportable>	can i wire the other end to gameport connectors?
<pwillard>	sorry.  not enough context.
<alexportable>	the other end of the dupont cables
<alexportable>	db-15
<pwillard>	the correct pin size for db15 is larger... so no, dupont will not make a tight fit.
<icepic>	alexportable: should be very easy to solder duponts to a db connector if need be
<alexportable>	okay thanks
<d3jake>	o/ all
<d3jake>	i'm wanting to tap into the odb ii port on my 1996 vw golf. does anyone know of a resource to tell me what all i can access through itin terms of sensor data?
<yotson>	no luck with service/workshop manuals?
<d3jake>	i always doubt that they'd be useful. i mean... you don't need to know how the ecu talks to everything, and what it says.
<yotson>	don't know for more modern cars. though for the few old vehicles my parents/i have i've found gb worth of info/documentation
<yotson>	also the software dealers run.
<yotson>	and with vw golf being popular cars. i guess most of the stuff of that 1996 vintage will be leaked by now. lol
<pwillard>	my advice.... find a bluetooth odb adapter... get a phone app that will read it.
<yotson>	and yay. geiger counter kit seems to work. \o/
<nashi>	has anyone here made an arduino irc client?
<d3jake>	nice idea.
<yotson>	we/i have banned a couple over the years. yes. xd
<nashi>	i bought a 192x160 color lcd with spi and sd card.
<yotson>	please, test them /not in here/ lol
<nashi>	ummmm yotson the only time it will be in here is when ive got it fully interactive and can use it to talk in here.
<nashi>	i promise.
<yotson>	\o/ :)
<nashi>	thats what i want it for.
<nashi>	i even bought a hardware encoding ps2 port (not software one) for it to dev it with.
<nashi>	if that gives an indication of it not being an idler.
<yotson>	i wasn't attacking you nashi. :) but buggy irc client, in here. meh.
<nashi>	nono yotson i was explaining im not a troublemaker like they were!
<nashi>	i like following rules so long as they are not double standards. :)
<yotson>	i didn't see dirc_... flapping. otherwise i would have nuked him. lol
<nashi>	flapping is disconnect reconnect spam right?
<sabesto>	the guy who make the arduino work as a keyboard, left his computer with the irc client in the foreground was nice
<yotson>	yup.
<yotson>	ah yes. that was nasty.
<yotson>	and we didn't have control over the channel yet back than.
<nashi>	flapping is disconnect reconnect spam right? or no?
<yotson>	nashi, yup.
<nashi>	oki thanks
<nashi>	i hate that. im even trying to get wired connection here in my new home to reduce such problems even more
<nashi>	i prefer connections which never fail honestly.
<pwillard>	we all do
<nashi>	but yeah i wont use it here or any other actual channel till ive got it reliable.
<sabesto>	i use irssi on my server, just log in from anywhere
<sabesto>	wifi or whatever
<nashi>	im waiting anxiously for the final parts for it to arrive in the mail
<d3jake>	yotson: do you know what sort of prices are reasonable for such a dongle? i'm seeing anywhere from $15 to $50
<nashi>	d3jake: dongle? did i miss something?
<yotson>	d3jake, sorry. no idea.
<nashi>	sorry im curious. what dongle?
<d3jake>	obd-ii bt
<yotson>	" pwillard> my advice.... find a bluetooth odb adapter... get a phone app that will read it. "
<yotson>	one of those. :)
<yotson>	ah.
<nashi>	ohhhhh.
<nashi>	ive seen those.
<nashi>	they are a lot of money....
<nashi>	hm. if you can hack the esp8266 to accept odb2 directly.... you could make a lot of money selling rigs that use one of those directly
<nashi>	at this time i dont know enough to even attempt that, let alone not having a car to test it with
<d3jake>	i found one for $15 :d
<nashi>	nice hope it works and is safe
<d3jake>	aye. i'd love to sit and play with it. i want to make a secondary display for my car. to show batt voltage, oil temp/press., etc.
<nashi>	there are rigs you can get that replace the entire instrument cluster. very slick
<pwillard>	actually... they are not really expensive
<d3jake>	i want to make a display with arduino ^^
<nashi>	pwillard: an esp8266 compared to them, thats expensive. :)
<nashi>	d3jake: yah i wanna make an irc client with one
<pwillard>	you can get a bluetooth odb adapter starting at $10
<pwillard>	maybe even less
<nashi>	thats not so bad
<nashi>	$15 is 50% more than that.
<nashi>	i get $180 a month for everything beyond room and board so i watch money close.
<d3jake>	pwillard: $10? the cheapest i can find is $15 with free shipping.
<nashi>	oh. yah some people dont include shipping in their figures, i keep forgetting that
<pwillard>	meh, i get free shipping with amazon... i keep forgetting that
<nashi>	^.^
<nashi>	if i used amazon a lot more id get prime but as is i use ebay a lot
<d3jake>	hehe
<d3jake>	i found one for $11, shipped.
<nashi>	wow
<nashi>	that is nice. wish i had a car >.>
<d3jake>	hehe, i bought a second one last week, for dirt cheap. i just need to get the transmission working.
<d3jake>	chassis is in good shape, too.
<nashi>	i cant afford a license, cheap car, transfer of title, and plates. $180 a month....
<nashi>	thats for everything like clothes, paper towels, treats/sodas, et cetra.
<nashi>	if i had a car and license and plates i could barely afford insurance and maint on it.
<nashi>	but i can afford arduino and such to learn on
<gniaka>	hey guys, anyone down to guide someone looking into getting started?
<nashi>	what kinda guidance you want/need?
<gniaka>	i have never done any electronics but it seems like a cool hobby to pick up. done some programming. i'm looking into some guidance about what to buy to try it out and get started
<gniaka>	i saw that the starter kit comes with a book which might be useful
<nashi>	i personally went the cheap as i can route. do you want to support the original designer of the product or go with cheaper clones?
<gniaka>	i don't mind, i was thinking about going the cheap route since i'm just starting out
<gniaka>	and if i get into it i could expand from there
<nashi>	thats definitely not always the right route to start up on.... you can run into gotchas and confusing things
<nashi>	i do suggest you get a kit including the name brand arduino uno.
<gniaka>	right that's why i mentioned the starting kit first
<nashi>	yah. the name brand kit with the uno in it is the best to start with if you can afford it, in my opinion.
<pwillard>	agree.  at least the 1st time...
<gniaka>	so i'd be able to go from 0 to understanding a bit more with the starting kit? do you have any idea?
<nashi>	yes.
<nashi>	its a very good kit, honestly. i looked deeply into it and others.
<pwillard>	you will be able to make better decisions about what to buy later, after you get some skills
<nashi>	ive got much experience with electronics in general.
<nashi>	the name brand kit has no real gotchas to worry about.
<nashi>	its really the best most foolproof way to get into it.
<gniaka>	okay
<gniaka>	it's like a 150$ canadian with taxes and everything i htink
<gniaka>	think*
<nashi>	after that youll be ready to get the clones if you wind up wanting them. and be able to handle gotchas with them
<pwillard>	you might consider this expensive if you compare it to ebay or amazon... but *these* guys have the best support and best documentation....  https://www.adafruit.com/products/68
<nashi>	and youll have one original one you can test against if something confuses you
<nashi>	yes adafruit rocks. i bought a couple things from them including my first arduino type product
<nashi>	i bought a boarduino kit, which is more advanced.
<nashi>	and an ftdi friend
<pwillard>	that was my first board as well, after making a severino (1 sided home made pc board myself)
<nashi>	ahhhh
<nashi>	i love the ftdi friend
<pwillard>	if you can etch boards at home, this is a fun experience. (and i wanted 9 pin serial)  http://www.arduino.cc/en/main/arduinoboardserialsinglesided3
<nashi>	i cant etch boards. im gonna build a cnc myself eventually then i can
<gniaka>	so the one you sent me is one that people put together for beginners, but there is one "official" put together by the arduino creators, right?
<nashi>	the arduino uno itself.
<nashi>	they sell that inside a kit.
<gniaka>	https://www.adafruit.com/products/1078 this
<nashi>	yep that one
<gniaka>	pwillard linked to this one https://www.adafruit.com/products/68 that's what i'm asking .sorry if this is super elemental
<nashi>	either will work. the second is far more complete will let you do a lot more projects
<nashi>	both have the original uno like ive been telling you is a good idea
<gniaka>	okay
<pwillard>	1) i consider adafruit official... pardon my bias.  2) the actual arduino starter kit from arduino.cc is quite similar maybe a bit more fluff and 1 or 2 parts more... but...   caveat....
<nashi>	pwillard: if it has the original uno its official imo
<pwillard>	i won't recommend anything that might give arduino.org money.
<nashi>	wait, what?
<pwillard>	long story...
<kline>	nashi: internally hostile forked
<gniaka>	lol
<nashi>	ohhhhhhh that. i heard about it.
<kline>	.org is run by 1 member of the original team, .cc by the other 4
<nashi>	oh cripes.
<gniaka>	so all the internal programming is done in c++?
<kline>	yes
<pwillard>	and really, the arduino starter kit (official) is $30 more and you only get a few more parts you can add yourself for less.
<gniaka>	i'm intermediate in python / lua, might have to pick it up as i wait for the delivery i guess
<gniaka>	pwillard good to know, that's what i was wondering.
<pwillard>	there is a not so obvious reason that the official store has the starter kit as "out of stock" i think.
<gniaka>	if i get the 64$ one i may get a good enough understanding to get the other parts for less from there
<nashi>	yes! either works
<pwillard>	basically, arduino.org stopped paying arduino.cc royalties for making *official* arduino stuff... so i now aim my purchases at adafruit... who do help support arduino.cc (aka arduino llc)
<nashi>	imo the uno itself is the most important part to get, and the rest is just stuff you wont have to go through the confusion of figuring out yourself.
<nashi>	pwillard: i understood as soon as you said the hostile split. i heard about it. but forgot.
<gniaka>	i just realized there is a store at like 2 streets from where i live
<gniaka>	where they sell the uno
<nashi>	oh awesome
<gniaka>	well, a kit for 36$. might be a knock-off version i guess?
<nashi>	id check to make sure.... its a good chance
<pwillard>	a true uno is made by arduino.org and puts money in the wrong pocket. buy a valid clone, for less and take what you saved and donate it at the arduino.cc site when you download the ide.
<nashi>	imo the true uno is the .cc one, pwillard
<gniaka>	it opens at 10. might as well go and pick one up. thanks for the help guys.
<nashi>	not a guy but your welcome :)
<gniaka>	guys and gals
<nashi>	youre
<gniaka>	:p
<nashi>	^.^
<icepic>	except the arduino donation page isnt https. 8-(
<nashi>	icepic: it isnt? o.o
<kline>	icepic: im p sure it directs forwards to a payment processor that is
<icepic>	nashi: not the page that later shows the https, but since you could have been sent to any https page in the world, its really too late then
<nashi>	hi kline
<nashi>	yeah, thats scary
<kline>	oh god its not
<kline>	whjat the fuck
<icepic>	i've complained to the webguys already.
<kline>	wiat, hold on
<kline>	its in a frame
<kline>	and the frame is https
<icepic>	kline: i cant see that it is.
<kline>	yeah, its a ui gaffe
<icepic>	it might be, but the frame doesnt have a padlock of its own
<icepic>	so if someone mitms me, they can show my a cleartext similar webpage and i would never know
<kline>	really the entire should should be https anyway, theres no reason not to in this day and age
<kline>	even my personal site has tls
<nashi>	id prefer https everywhere
<icepic>	its not ok to say "if you look with view-source you can see that we later send you to https"
<icepic>	for whatever the issues tls has, having people to blindly trust that they are safe if the owner says you are seems like very bad advice.
<kline>	whatta fug
<alexportable>	which one would be the best to connect things to an arduino 2560? http://www.dx.com/s/breadboard%2bwires?pricesort=up
<pwillard>	i'm serious when i say that buying an official uno does not give arduino.cc (arduino llc) any support.
<kline>	buy a clone from sfe instead, and the money goes to the right place
<nashi>	so there arent any that you can buy from .cc at all now?
<pwillard>	as well as adafruit, as i mentioned
<yotson>	ah. thanks kline. missed it.
<kline>	no joke as well funambuli just left ##fix_your_connection
<pwillard>	alexportable, these will all work... male pins are needed for the 2560  other end... depends on what you need to attach to.
<yotson>	yeah. he is messing about as well.
<alexportable>	pwillard: db-15
<pwillard>	oh  in that case, none
<alexportable>	pwillard: i want to make a connector so i can hotplug it to the arduino
<skroon>	is there a easy way to measure battery charging levels on a lipo or li-ion ?
<skroon>	is it just measuring voltage? or is that too simple of a thought :)
<deshipu>	skroon: analog pin with a voltage divider?
<nashi>	skroon: look for lipo fuel gauge on ebay
<deshipu>	skroon: just voltage
<pwillard>	if you want cables... i can be "contracted". i can easily make dupont to db wire adapters
<nashi>	automated.
<alexportable>	that'll be db connector, cables, arduino
<d3jake>	i really with win7 update descriptions told you something more than "hey! this does stuff. the stuff that it does is really cool, but you have to use this kb number on our website to go find it." as if they couldn't use that bit to actually tell you. -_-; freaking fools...
<nashi>	they do it on purpose
<pwillard>	and alexportable anything you order from dealextreme... you better not need for 6 months.
<kline>	d3jake: the best thing is that even then, they lie in the kb
<d3jake>	great
<d3jake>	i wish i knew about reading the kb... i'll bet they turned on a ton of shit to run in the background.
<pwillard>	kb is the black magic *trust us* area...  you always have to guess how much they are not saying.
<joey8>	what's kb
<nashi>	knowledge base. short in microsoftese for we screwed up something were patching it but we wont tell you what it really is or does or did
<joey8>	nashi< ah ha - do'nt do microsift... until of course, we hear that they are going to dable with arduinos aswell. <sigh>
<sibiria>	last week saw a worrying/interesting update from ms
<sibiria>	one that first activated a new "diagnostic" service, then started user login process, then the shadow volume copy process, the .cab compressor
<skroon>	nashi: right, so i'm new to fuel gauges... the take into account temperature differences etc?
<sibiria>	i sat perplexed watching the whole procedure after installing the update
<nashi>	skroon: i think so. they are really nice. julian ilett did videos on them on his youtube video channel. i bought one have yet to use it myself
<sibiria>	this was the creepy one that was pushed out last week: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3022345
<d3jake>	aye
<d3jake>	that's what started this
<sibiria>	oh, you had issues with that one update too?
<sibiria>	i watched it do its chores for about 5 minutes until it was done collecting "diagnostics"
<sibiria>	then i stopped and disabled the service
<sibiria>	5 minutes of user login->shadow volume copy->.cab compressor
<sibiria>	i now enjoy a richer user experience
<d3jake>	naw
<d3jake>	i never allowed it to install.
<d3jake>	i was thinking "this update description could be a politician. it talks alot and says nothing."
<skroon>	nashi: checking out his channel now... looks like a good resource right ? :)
<nashi>	yah hes awesp,e
<nashi>	awesome
<skroon>	nashi: i'm reading the data sheet now... and i'm a bit confused when something is a "single" or "double" cell battery
<nashi>	two cells in ceries is double.
<nashi>	a single cell is usually 3.7v
<skroon>	nashi: i've got a lio-ion battery, which looks like a block with 3x a lio-ion stacked... not sure if that would be a triple-cell then?
<nashi>	double that for a 2 cell
<nashi>	youd have to ask the oem of that battery
<skroon>	nashi: ahhh, mine is just giving 3.7v
<d3jake>	some batteries have two smaller cells making them up.
<alexportable>	pwillard: i know
<d3jake>	if they're in series or parallel will change if they're increasing voltage or capacity.
<nashi>	paralell is basically the same in effect to the fuel gauge as a single cell
<skroon>	nashi:  http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/polymer-lithium-ion-battery-6600mah-37v-p-1711.html  thats the one i have
<nashi>	looks to me to be a 3p cell, so you can charge it as a single cell lipo
<skroon>	nashi: 3p meaing something specific? but indeed sounds like single cell 3.7v
<nashi>	3 cells in paralell
<nashi>	which can be managed like a single large cell
<skroon>	nashi: right, cool thanks
<nashi>	^.^
<nashi>	from what ive seen on julians channel skroon those fuel gauges are perfect for arduino bat mgmt. i bought one and really looking forward to messing with it
<nashi>	running 5v arduino pro mini clones on 3.3v, any issues i should be aware of? i want to run them at 16mhz with default firmware, any gotchas?
<pwillard>	3.3v and 16mhz do not go together
<nashi>	thats not what im seeing when i read, i read they run fine at that, but arent designed/approved for it
<nashi>	is that info wrong?
<pwillard>	running an arduino at 16mhz with 3.3v supply exceeds manufacturers max ratings from the data sheet.
<nashi>	i know this part, as i said.
<nashi>	just like ocing a cpu.
<nashi>	im asking if anyone knows of actual real world problems with it
<pwillard>	exceed atmel data sheet at your own risk.
<nashi>	yah i understand that as ive said several times
<pwillard>	it will probably work.  if/when it fails... live with the results
<nashi>	im prepared for that, ffs
<nashi>	ive been ocing computers since the 8088
<pwillard>	it is essntially the same as overclocking... we know it is possible... does it mean that the silicon lives fast and dies young.   usually
<pwillard>	and i pre-date 8088
<nashi>	good for you so do i
<nashi>	what is with your additude problem
<pwillard>	i'm not ever going to recommend or stand behind ignoring the datasheet
<nashi>	i never asked you to. seriously you need therapy
<sibiria>	nashi: just because it runs doesn't mean it manages to keep up with the external clock
<sibiria>	do a simple iteration test against nominal voltage required for 16 mhz and you'll quickly find out
<sibiria>	oh, it is a she. that explains a lot
<nashi>	elementary procedure.
<sibiria>	if it's elementary, why did you ask in the first place instead of just confirming?
<nashi>	and no, it doesnt "explain" anything, sexist person.
<kline>	sibiria: :<
<nashi>	i asked if others had tried it and found out if it worked or not, genius.
<ozzzy>	i've never seen it work
<nashi>	thanks ozzzy thats just the kind of info im after.
<pwillard>	i *have* had it work... my part ran too hot... i won't do it again, i won't recommend it.
<nashi>	thanks. finally. thats exactly what im after, info wise. :)
<sibiria>	atmegas specs should be enough of a guideline. there must be a good reason they ask for 4.5v for 16mhz operation and not 3.3v :)
<sibiria>	atmels*
<nashi>	i dont care about guideline i care about what i can squeeze out of it.
<krayzon>	good suggestions
<pwillard>	according to the forums, it does look like someone has tried.
<krayzon>	i've done some research at the forums
<pwillard>	but i agree, it's far easier to get a used $5 linksys wrt54 and put openwrt or dd-wrt... having done that myself many times... and with the yun being $70 or more... it's way more expensive than the dd-wrt option
<krayzon>	i've been trying since..
<krayzon>	12 am xd
<krayzon>	12md*
<darkelement>	guys my lcd is only displaying some lines on max brightness while running any of the hello world program and i am sure that my hardware is hooked up correctly, and i have tried changing the potentiometer but to no avail. any ideas?
<pwillard>	well, see my first comment... you need to be willing to admit defeat... even temporarily
<krayzon>	=/
<krayzon>	i was searching for more technical help here instead of emotional
<pwillard>	lets look at it this way... i don't have a yun, nor will i buy one.  i don't even know anybody here who has one and i'm here every day.
<baldengineer>	you're searching for help on something very few people will ever do
<baldengineer>	pwillard: i have a yun,  it's never left the box.  but i buy one of everything
<krayzon>	lol
<pwillard>	yeah, just like my edison, galileo, electric imp and rfduino
<krayzon>	so i guess you have a.. raspberry pi?
<pwillard>	of course,
<pwillard>	the pi is a much better option compared to a yun
<krayzon>	you guys hate the yun?
<darkelement>	anyone? any ideas on why my lcd won't display anything?
<pwillard>	not hate...  there is just not much to like.
<darkelement>	the circuit is hooked up correctly.
<krayzon>	what version do you guys prefer the most?
<baldengineer>	darkelement #1 reason for what you describe, is bad connections
<baldengineer>	(and yes, everyone who has bad connections claims they don't)
<pwillard>	darkelement, a hooked up properly lcd will *work* unless it broken, bad connections or your code doesn't match reality.
<pwillard>	agreed.  seen many times here
<pwillard>	krayzon, version of what?
<krayzon>	arduino
<darkelement>	it would have to be a broken wire or something because ive double checked it against the circuit diagram on the website and it is the same
<pwillard>	krayzon, i have over 30 aduino-like devices... i have no favorite since i use the one that most closely matches my needs.  if i do xbee, i grab a fio for example.
<krayzon>	30??
<krayzon>	omg
<pwillard>	if i make a remote sensing/logging device, i use a seeedstudio stalker
<krayzon>	why a lot of them haha?
<krayzon>	well..
<pwillard>	1) because i help out here  2) i write a small blog  3) i tinker... all the time.
<krayzon>	should i create a thread in the arduino forum?
<pwillard>	you can try... don't expect a flood of responses... i do wish you luck though.
<darkelement>	it should display empty boxes if the brightness is all the way up on the lcd, white boxes, right?
<t4nk642>	hey, so i am setting my arduino to send serial data to my pc, i have a basic serial data grabbing program written for the pc and just for testing purposes i have the duino set to send some ascii in a loop. if i view the serial monitor on the arduino ide it works perfectly. but when i try to view it with the app it doesnt work
<t4nk642>	i was able to capture the string a couple of times but i think i caught while there was still data in the buffer
<pwillard>	i would expect that people will tell you the yun was designed more for internet of things... not to be a router.  there are of course people trying to make yocto into a router... example: https://www.yoctoproject.org/downloads/bsps/daisy16/edgerouter
<pwillard>	t4nk642, keep in mind that your app must keep the port open... just in case... well, you don't
<t4nk642>	pwillard, im pretty sure its keeping it open
<pwillard>	also... sending a tight loop with serial.print() can have negative side effects
<t4nk642>	i have a 1000ms delay between each send
<t4nk642>	transmit*
<t4nk642>	and it should be keeping the port open since i cant open it in the arduino ide while my app is running
<pwillard>	but "techically", serial monitor does nothing that putty or a properly crafted python app won't do
<baldengineer>	what terminal program are you using
<krayzon>	pwillard
<krayzon>	did you see the 9 dollar computer?
<pwillard>	we have discussed the chip here starting a few says ago... not in any detail though
<pwillard>	days, i mean
<t4nk642>	http://www.codeshare.io/wxzfy
<pwillard>	t4nk642, i have my arduino talking to a python app once per minute everyday 24/7
<krayzon>	oh really?
<t4nk642>	this is in c#
<krayzon>	sorry, i don't visit this chat that much
<krayzon>	just when i struggle with arduino
<krayzon>	planning to buy it?
<pwillard>	http://graphme.asuscomm.com/graph.php  <-- all from sensors on arduino  (yes, my office sensor is flakey)
<t4nk642>	that link is for the code i am using for the serial grabber
<pwillard>	krayzon, no... actually... i've been burned a few times on kickstarter so i'm taking a break from being a supporter.
<darkelement>	how can i tell if my lcd is broken
<krayzon>	but chip is getting really high 1 million dollars now
<krayzon>	i feel like i'm going to back it ( first time i back a project in kickstarter)
<darkelement>	krayzon, me as well
<krayzon>	chip might solve a lot of issues for those places living with poverty
<pwillard>	rpi managed that as well
<krayzon>	rpi?
<t4nk642>	oh... i am the worse kind of idiot
<flea86>	krayzon raspberry pi
<krayzon>	how did rpi managed that?
<zapduino>	jello
<flea86>	hello
<krayzon>	i mean, chip is a computer easy to use for familys that cannot afford a laptop or desktop
<pwillard>	rpi also managed to be an affordable computer when one was needed badly.
<krayzon>	but rpi doesn't have windows e.g
<zapduino>	windows is for n00bs
<pwillard>	god, who needs windows.
<krayzon>	i'm talking about kids
<krayzon>	-_-
<darkelement>	their skills will be forged in the fiery furnace of linux
<krayzon>	lol
<pwillard>	kids who will surf using firefox don't care if its windows or linux
<krayzon>	but it's easier, isnt it?
<flea86>	krayzon i've seen kids learn about debian wheezy on the pi first-hand - it can be done
<krayzon>	well
<krayzon>	you win
<pwillard>	and chip is designed for debian
<darkelement>	you guys know how to test if an lcd is broken btw?
<darkelement>	i think mine may b3
<darkelement>	be
<krayzon>	well in the video i saw windows 8
<zapduino>	if i had kids and they snuck any microsoft product into my home... i would divorce the wife
<krayzon>	lol
<t4nk642>	so i noticed that i was doing print instead of write for the serial out of the duino, but still not working
<krayzon>	why hate that much microsoft
<flea86>	krayzon on the chip? win8 license would cost much more than the hw.. lol
<krayzon>	i mean i hate every single microsoft product but the os is fine haha
<pwillard>	and unlike linux... microsoft tends to want money for os... so $9 would not be $9
<krayzon>	you can replicate win8 licenses
<krayzon>	i have the same license in about 4 computers
<krayzon>	but well
<krayzon>	you got a point
<t4nk642>	krayzon, when ever we set up a new win7 for a jobsite, i copy the key since they all run offline
<krayzon>	lol
<t4nk642>	i mainly use them for my test pcs at work
<t4nk642>	"mainly"
<pwillard>	i have nothing against windows... it provides me my paycheck.   and i am now in a moral dilemma to avoid what i'm reading and just shut up or do something.
<krayzon>	what operating system do you use to play >.<?
<pwillard>	since i develop on linux and windows, i don't have a favorite.  i use the best tool for the job or make my stuff work on both
<krayzon>	which one do you use for your home?
<pwillard>	why do you think i have one pc?  i just said i didn't.
<t4nk642>	i mainly work with premade application and just have to integrate them with each other, they usually play nice enough that i dont have to do much
<pwillard>	my laptop will boot either linux or win7 depending on what i'm working on
<krayzon>	which linux distribution?
<t4nk642>	why the hell isnt this thing working? does arduino need something sent to it before it will transmit serial data?
<pwillard>	but, a lot of tools i use are windows only.  many of the 3d drawing tools i use, or my schematic tools, or atmel studio for example... all windows.
<pwillard>	krayzon, i use latest ubuntu on all my high end pc's, ubuntumate on lowend pc's and debian is i need to make a simple server.
<pwillard>	t4nk642, normally... no
<pwillard>	are you waiting for the bootloader to get out of the way?
<t4nk642>	then why is it only sending data to the arduino ide?
<pwillard>	see previous statement
<krayzon>	is it worth spending the $9 for the chip?
<t4nk642>	the sketch is already running, if i open up serial monitor in the ide it pulls the data just fine but not on my program
<krayzon>	or better get myself a raspbery pi?
<t4nk642>	and i know the port is being opened by my program because if i try to open it at the same time with the ide it says its busy
<pwillard>	krayzon, to make it useful, you need to by a vga or hdmi output card to go with it... so no... $9 might have you wishing you paid more
<krayzon>	dammit
<pwillard>	t4nk642, right... but have your c# code wait 5 seconds and see if that makes a difference.
<pwillard>	after you open the port
<krayzon>	does the rpi has that adapter?
<krayzon>	vga or dmi?
<krayzon>	hdmi
<pwillard>	hdmi or composite out.  pretty sure chip only comes with composite out
<pwillard>	and no, i don't so c#, sorry  :(
<pwillard>	do
<krayzon>	hmm
<krayzon>	the raspberry pi seems like a much better deal than chip then
<flea86>	krayzon well especially the newer pi2 yeah
<pwillard>	darkelement, if you accidently reversed the power and ground... it's toast... personal experience
<krayzon>	i mean, if you need a computer in your house
<krayzon>	and you can't afford an expensive one
<pwillard>	i have a pi2 running ubuntumate.
<darkelement>	pwillard: god i hope not
<pwillard>	not bad for $32
<pwillard>	(runs like crap, to be honest)
<flea86>	heh
<krayzon>	hmm
<t4nk642>	pwillard, i added a 5 second wait but still nothing. i see on the arduino that the rx led lights up when i open the port but it doesnt tx
<pwillard>	i will take raspbian over it any day.
<krayzon>	you can't run libreoffice there?
<alvarop>	alrighty, got my arduino working on this chromebook :d
<pwillard>	nice
<pwillard>	i read it was now possible
<alvarop>	did it through linux though. there was an extension but it doesn's seem to be supported anymore
<dingbat>	hey, what’s everyone’s favorite 120vac controller board doohickey? i need to pwm a resistive load, should be <500w
<pwillard>	t4nk642, hmmm.  man... i do that kind of serial stuff all the time with perl and python... even command line wxdevc++ and i have no issues with serial.
<pwillard>	i just have no advice for c#
<t4nk642>	pwillard, http://www.codeshare.io/wxzfy
<t4nk642>	thats the code i am using for the program on my pc
<t4nk642>	and wtf, just tried it again now and it received data
<pwillard>	>.<
<krayzon>	pwillard, can you assist me a bit doing some research according to what i'm trying to do with the yun?
<t4nk642>	wait nvm, it was just pulling from the buffer i guess cause i just used the ide serial montiro
<krayzon>	i'm getting sick =/
<pwillard>	sory man.  1) it's time for sleep  2) i'm a bad resource for anything yun related.
<krayzon>	oh
<krayzon>	i see.
<krayzon>	thanks then.
<smashcat>	hi, anyone know if it's easy to mod an arduino mega 256 to prevent it taking power from the usb port?
<smashcat>	(need to power it via vin pin, but still have it connected via serial to a pc)
<dingbat>	smashcat: sure, take the usb port off
<dingbat>	…oh, didn’t see that part
<smashcat>	haha
<dingbat>	you can probably lift the power pin on the usb connector
<dingbat>	also, if you’re powering it from vin, it shouldn’t draw from usb….
<smashcat>	sorry, meant the 5v pin, i have a 40a 5v supply connected to it.
<smashcat>	problem is that it defaults to using the usb supply, which will damage the pc
<dingbat>	why is it defaulting to usb? it should prefer the 5v rail
<smashcat>	dingbat: don't know, but tested with my bench supply, as soon as i connect usb, it draws nothing from the external supply
<dingbat>	mmmph that’s odd. well, anyway, you should be able to simply lift the usb power pin (or alternatively remove the 500ma fuse)
<pwillard>	that actually sounds wrong... as it should always defer to taking power from the dc jack over usb
<smashcat>	pretty annoying as i have some muxes that are leeching current from the io pins and creating a circuit. so even if only gnd and the io pins are connected from the arduino, it still ends up pulling all current from the usb. i suppose i could use opto-isolators to the mux inputs...
<poppavic>	heh.. they installed the sensing backwards ;-)
<smashcat>	pwillard: i only have a 5v supply, so can't use the dc jack
<pwillard>	oh, well, thats different
<pwillard>	you are getting the correct behavior
<pwillard>	since 5v *pin* is a supply pin you can abuse as an voltage input pin if you *don't* plug in usb.
<pwillard>	so, the way to get what you want is to find a 9v dc wallwart.
<pwillard>	or... cut the usb trace for power
<pwillard>	(which would be sad)
<dingbat>	desolder the usb fuse. it’s largish and easy to replace
<pwillard>	or that... good point
<smashcat>	pwillard: adding a 9v supply probably won't solve the problem of a circuit being made due to the muxes leeching current through the io. yeah cool, i'll desolder the fuse
<pwillard>	well, to be honest muxes sound like a problem
<pwillard>	that should not be the the behavior you get
<t4nk642>	pwillard, i got it !!!!!
<pwillard>	and... what was messing you up?
<t4nk642>	needed to set request to send on the pc program
<t4nk642>	to true
<t4nk642>	wasnt defined before
<pwillard>	ah, logical.
<pwillard>	well, i didn't want to yell, "fix your code!" as you might have noticed... :-p
<t4nk642>	because you are a asshole
<t4nk642>	a beautiful asshole
<t4nk642>	that likes to help people
<t4nk642>	the hard way
<pwillard>	but i did have a damn good feeling it was your code... lol
<t4nk642>	thanks for making me look
<pwillard>	i just don't do c# so you made my eyes cross
<t4nk642>	now to undue all the undueidities i done did to get it to skeleton code
<pwillard>	lol... been there... many times
<flea86>	lol
<t4nk642>	oh you dont even want to know... but ill tell you anyway. i saved over the original
<alvarop>	trying to connect my lcd to the arduino. supposedly the potmeter will change contrast but i don't see any change
<alvarop>	well, in fact i don't see anything on screen
<flea86>	t4nk642 eh, try accidentally overwriting your backup usb drive with a custom hdd image intended for an sd card.. :p
<pwillard>	oh damn,  done that too
<t4nk642>	i have even worse horror stories of my stupidity
<pwillard>	lol... time for me to run... needed to be asleep 45 minutes ago
<t4nk642>	i was manually replicating a master server that has all of the access control info for one of the counties i service, accidentally pushed a copy from our test server to the master and whiped the whole db
<t4nk642>	luckily we had a backup
<t4nk642>	it was like it never happened
<flea86>	"<t4nk642> luckily we had a backup" luckly for you ;)
<flea86>	pwillard 'nite
<t4nk642>	well worse case scenario we would have had to manually rebuild the master db with the data from each site buildings local db
<t4nk642>	but yeah i would have probably gotten my 2 weeks notice if it came to that
<flea86>	t4nk642 well i'm glad to hear that it didn't come to that. my loss was total.. :(
<t4nk642>	that sucks
<t4nk642>	god damn, i wasted so much time trying to get this thing running. lol it has to do is shut off a computer when a battery runs bellow 11v
<t4nk642>	all it has to do*
<flea86>	t4nk642 and there's nothing off-the-shelf that you can buy? hmm
<flea86>	i mean a ready made solution
<t4nk642>	...like a ups? no
<flea86>	yeah
<flea86>	ok
<t4nk642>	they arent using a ups, they basically have a large battery bank of 12v deap cycle batteries daisy chained and connected to a inverter
<t4nk642>	the ups is recharged by a solar cell
<t4nk642>	the battery bank not "ups"*
<flea86>	t4nk642 i see, and you simply want to monitor the battery bank levels and act upon them right?
<t4nk642>	we can get a ups that supports the feature but thats going to cost maybe 100 per unit for 12 sites
<t4nk642>	yep
<alvarop>	ugh, the lcd seems to be in false contact. i guess it will need some soldering?
<alvarop>	if i hold it on the pins it turns on but it's so iffy
<flea86>	t4nk642 does the solar cell have a power regulator as well? i wonder if those have low battery output alarms..
<flea86>	*battery level
<t4nk642>	and ive been messing around with the arduino for a little while, and figure id brind a cheaper alternative to the table, while still charging a bit extra for my awesomely spectacular coding skills
<t4nk642>	i havent seen the whole setup yet, i am going out tomorrow to one of the sites tomorrow so i will get a good look
<flea86>	heh
<t4nk642>	bring*
<flea86>	fair enough
<t4nk642>	why isnt this damn site auto scrolling
<alvarop>	kiwi client?
<t4nk642>	freenode
<timemage>	t4nk642, for what it's worth, on an instrustrial level that sort of thing would be called a ups, though usually with a battery charger rather than just solar.
<alvarop>	some web clients are like that
<t4nk642>	if it doesnt talk to me, i dont consider it a ups
<timemage>	t4nk642, talk?
<t4nk642>	i mean communicate with any network device or computer
<chisight>	t4nk642, earlier we were suggesting that emulating what a commercial ups does would accomplish what you want without re-inventing the wheel more than needed.
<t4nk642>	thats what i am doing, no?
<chisight>	sorry, i've been away and haven't read.
<timemage>	chisight, t4nk642 you mean connect a conventional ups to the battery bank just to use its mains and battery voltage sensing capability?
<t4nk642>	basically, going to read the voltage from the batteries, at various levels different alerts will be sent and when the batteries get very low it will send a signal to the pc to hibernate or shut down
<chisight>	timemage, i think t4nk642's project is a large capacity solar charged battery banks.
<timemage>	chisight, and what i'm saying is, if his system has no feedback, and he can get feedback by adding a normal ups to it as a sensing device.  ideally a ups which is good enough that it change charging parameters that can be dialed in.  getting ahold of a ups without battery free of charge is usually pretty easy.
<timemage>	and the software has already been written
<chisight>	ahh, that would make the project easier if it can handle the current the solar puts out.
<timemage>	chisight, hmm, well voltage. otherwise i'm not sure what you're saying.
<t4nk642>	i doubt i would be able to get 12 of those ups' for free
<chisight>	i think he's suggesting only monitoring the parallel string using the ups, that'd be only one ups.
<timemage>	t4nk642, go to a dump, yardsale, etc.  from what i can tell most ups are perfectly fine, just dead battery, which you don't need.
<timemage>	t4nk642, anyway, it's a slightly crazy idea.
<t4nk642>	and assuming the battery bank is running at 12v i can just hook up the ups battery terminals to the battery bank?
<chisight>	timemage, it seems pretty reasonable, if the ups is set up for the same voltage.
<t4nk642>	the nice about doing it with the arduino is that i can also have it sent text/email alerts because these are unnamed sites
<timemage>	t4nk642, that depends on a number of things.  nhe battery bank your talking about would be larger than than what the ups would normally contain, so /if/ it ever attempted to charge it should be safe for the battery.  the other part would be to see if the ups can provide information about battery voltage without inverting, which, it may not be able to.
<chisight>	just not sure what would happen when the ups detected no ac and no load.  i vaguely remember apc ones going nuts when that happened.
<timemage>	t4nk642, or it may, but the software may not be designed to pay attention to it when the inverter portion is told not to invert.
<t4nk642>	alot of them drop a duce when ac drops
<timemage>	t4nk642, i just wanted to mention it, in case it gave you any ideas.
<t4nk642>	thanks, definitely something to look into
<t4nk642>	my main concern with that is it may look a little ghetto
<t4nk642>	at least i can dress a arduino in a nice small enclosure
<chisight>	rip the board out and show it off behind a nice plexiglas sheet.  lol
<timemage>	t4nk642, i wasn't sure whether or not you had any ac involved.  if you do, you can just leave the thing on.  the only disadwnatage i can see to using it at that point is that the inverter (even used) will slightly load the batteries.  but, then at least you'll know when to shut down.
<timemage>	t4nk642, even unused, rather.
<t4nk642>	there is no ac except when they have to charge the batteries due to shitty weather
<t4nk642>	omg, why wont this site auto scroll, this is getting stupid
<timemage>	t4nk642, why use the gateway at all?
<t4nk642>	gateway?
<timemage>	t4nk642, you know that you don't need to use the web to get to irc, right?
<chisight>	many of those ups' ran in series only so if it was a 4 battery pack @6v each, it would expect 24v.
<t4nk642>	oh, i know but mirc is not playing nice with me
<timemage>	t4nk642, everyone and their dog has written an irc client.  most of them are crap, but then... you're using a website.  one you don't like even.
<timemage>	t4nk642, seems you shouldn't have too much trouble locating one you like or at least don't hate so much.
<t4nk642>	i figured out the problem
<t4nk642>	there was a tab open in the interface that was stopping it from auto scrolling
<t4nk642>	i was wondering why it stopped all of a sudden
<timemage>	t4nk642, out of curiosity, what are they using for a solar regulator?
<t4nk642>	not sure yet
<t4nk642>	i am going to see one of the sites tomorrow
<timemage>	t4nk642, a lot of them have a serial interface.  sometimes it's on the display.  granted, intended for what you're doing, but it would make things simpler.
<t4nk642>	its a few years old, so im going on the assumption that it doesnt
<timemage>	t4nk642, and through that interface you can get basic numbers.  battery voltage and charge current in some cases.  not always to the precision you'd like.  current to amps at least (often no better), voltage to tenth volts.
<timemage>	t4nk642, dunno, to give you an idea, outback power systems, that make a lot of solar regulators have a serial port on the bottom on the "mate" which is the programming interface/display.  you can get battery voltage to at least half volts if not tenth volts.
<timemage>	t4nk642, some of them have an ethernet interface on them.
<timemage>	t4nk642, morningstar also makes regulators.  some of them have a serial port. dunno if their protocol is open, but there is official software that is free.
<t4nk642>	i will be sure to look out for that, it would make my life much easier
<timemage>	t4nk642, xantrex (schneider) use an rs485 (xanbus) setup, dunno there either, but at least electrically it would be easy to interface/spy on.
<timemage>	t4nk642, most of them make a computer interface that will do what you want, but maybe at a cost you won't appreciate.
<timemage>	t4nk642, e.g. outback makes something called the axs port which interfaces to their solar regulators. it will expose those numbers to a pc via modbus.  incidentally, modbus is pretty simple and should be easily interfaced with someothing like an arduino.
<timemage>	t4nk642, actually, even a lot of the simplest solar regulators also have a load-disconnect contact which you can usually tune for a given battery voltage.
<timemage>	t4nk642, so you needn't do actual voltage sensing yourself.  you may be able to just wire it to your arduino as a switch closure.
<t4nk642>	well, in any case, i have the sketch mostly finished, so im prepared for either scenario
<eulareader>	oh
<captain_morgan>	anyone with experience using sparkfun 7-segment displays seen malformed characters before? 8 always appears as 9 and many others
<timemage>	captain_morgan, would help to have a link to the product page. also #sparkfun
<captain_morgan>	oh nice
<captain_morgan>	it's this one https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11442
<timemage>	captain_morgan, i think i have one of those.  different color, though.
<timemage>	captain_morgan, i didn't notice it doing anything particularly odd.  how are you testing?
<captain_morgan>	trying to work with the firmware here
<captain_morgan>	https://github.com/sparkfun/serial7segmentdisplay/blob/master/firmware/serial%207-segment%20display/serial_7_segment_display_firmware/serial_7_segment_display_firmware.ino
<captain_morgan>	even that after correcting the display_type bug doesn't work
<captain_morgan>	the base example starts by displaying 1234
<captain_morgan>	the 2 is missing the lower left
<timemage>	captain_morgan,  hmm, meaning you're modify the display itself?  not just using it?
<captain_morgan>	yes but i'm still using the sevseg library
<timemage>	captain_morgan, okay. did you ever use it the way most people use it and if so was it displaying correctly then?
<captain_morgan>	fired some uart strings at it, that's about all
<timemage>	captain_morgan, and it worked or did not work?
<captain_morgan>	ahhh, yeah, pretty sure
<timemage>	captain_morgan, something i'd want to be sure about =)
<timemage>	captain_morgan, i mean, to answer your original question, nope, didn't have problems with it.
<alvarop>	just scavenged my first led from an old dollar-store radio. sniff sniff
<captain_morgan>	yeah....
<captain_morgan>	i tend to do that
<d3jake>	aaaaand, my start is dead. thankfully it's not on my primary car.
<captain_morgan>	timemage, any chance you have that board handy?
<captain_morgan>	actually, nevermind
<nashi>	uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh. stupid house rules. i cant solder in my bedroom because they have had trouble with people starting fires here before. i wanna try out my new iron but its dark outside!
<tefad>	solder in the bathtub, that'll teach them
<nashi>	not allowed to do that either.
<d3jake>	as bad as troubleshooting code can be in here, i just read through some forumsposts on arduino.cc, and i think it'd be 10x being ona forum vs. chat
<tefad>	10x means "thanks" in my book. maybe you accidentally a word?
<tawr>	no tefad, he means 'as bad', 10x refers back to the difficulty of help via forums vs here
<stuartbegun>	hi i'm a student with cs background how do i start begin developing flapping microair vehicles
<stuartbegun>	?
<stuartbegun>	any help is appreciated
<xark>	stuartbegun: like an artificial bird?
<stuartbegun>	yeah but one that is smaller in size
<stuartbegun>	something that fits in our hands
<stuartbegun>	like the ones shown here http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~skgupta/umdbird/
<xark>	stuartbegun: i am not aware of such devices (for hobby purposes - i've seen a few high end ones like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l0xavwi7ku )
<xark>	hmm, http://www.birdkit.com/
<stuartbegun>	thats a nice website thanks, it does have some great kits.
<stuartbegun>	but i want to make one by myself from scratch, so i'm actually for some kind of book/course to get started.
<icepic>	stuartbegun: you would need to figure out really small motors with good power output and batteries that last even while powering such motors, i guess.
<stuartbegun>	yeah that ones i'll try to get from a kit
<icepic>	keeping the weight down while still flapping enough to stay afloat would be one big challenge. the second to have sensors that tell you if the bird is leaning somewhere
<icepic>	thirdly, make the movement work ok for flight, and able to compensate for leaning to keep it straight, i guess
<stuartbegun>	how do i decide on the size and shape of the wings, where do they have to bend(to flap) and things like that?
<stuartbegun>	oh yeah thats a nice point i need to get tilt sensors
<stuartbegun>	icepic: bad connection have i missed anything after the 3 points you've stated?
<sbl>	hi everyone! i was building some project at atmega328p and i need connect atmega with computer via usb for receive serial communications. what i do? i need usb-rs232 ttl converter to this or just usb > tx/rx/gnd/5v ? please help :)
<poppavic>	http://www.arduino.cc/en/main/standalone
<icepic>	stuartbegun: no, i dont know anything about placing the wings or joints, or how to fly using flapping, so that last part would be the science thing where you would need to study birds in slowmotion or whatever.
<stuartbegun>	thank you for the suggestions icepic :)
<icepic>	i've seen movies and clips from birds in large indoors areas, and looks super neat.
<icepic>	but i have more or less zero ideas on the physical side of solving that ever.
<sbl>	poppavic: ok, thanks :)
<poppavic>	sbl:  the first time it works yer grin will be ear to ear ;-)
<sbl>	poppavic: i just wondering whether if i need a converter but i need :)
<poppavic>	yep, a good breakout with dtr exposed for sure
<poppavic>	..and you might as well insure it's got a switch/jumper so you can feed the 5v 3v3 or zero volts to the board, too
<sbl>	poppavic: can i use a converter to read only data without power circuit? i would like to power supply from the externally system (12v dc)
<poppavic>	i've not bothered to do so, but yeah: if the ftdi-board you get will let you not feed power to the breadboard, it would expect you to power the circuit yourself.
<poppavic>	sbl:  google for it, someone has already done it at least once.
<xark>	sbl: you can have separate power, just make sure you have a common ground connection (but do not connect different power supply positives together).
<yotson>	o/
<sbl>	xark: ok, so can i connect only tx/rx from usb-rs232 ttl or i have to connect tx/rx/gnd (gnd from external power supply)
<poppavic>	and dtr
<sbl>	yes, and dtr
<sbl>	txd rxd gnd dtr will be okay for data transfer only without power supply from usb?
<sbl>	ok i found this http://botland.com.pl/7142-thickbox_default/konwerter-usb-uart-ftdi-335v-na-przewod-usb.jpg
<sbl>	txd, rxd, gnd, dtr
<poppavic>	https://www.adafruit.com/products/284 is often recommended, i got this: http://embeddedwirelesssolutions.com/ews_ftdi_breakout_board
<sbl>	oki :) i'm not from usa. so i have to order from around me.
<poppavic>	that's fine, notice the difference between the 3: yours and my two
<poppavic>	off to bed.
<yotson>	looking at some code is they alter pwm duty cycle as ocr2b++ does that really work like that? will that get compiled to a read-modify-write?
<yotson>	yes, i could find out myself. but maybe someone knows already. :)
<xark>	yotson: i could see that working.  load, adi, store.
<chisight>	assuming the register is defined volatile as it should be so the compiler doesn't optimize it out.
<xark>	not atomic...but it reads, modifies, writes. :)
<yotson>	its inside an isr. so i guess the atomicity (ha) is ok.
<xark>	:)
<xark>	pretty sure the standard defs are volatile
<chisight>	i would assume they are.  never looked.
<chisight>	if not volatile, the compiler could notice the variable never being used again and throw away the write.  of course that could happen all over so they pretty much have to be declared volatile.
<xark>	chisight: they are volatile (just checked).  however, since they are global the compiler can't throw them away completely (but it can delay the write etc.)
<chisight>	ahh, yeah.  didn't think about being global.
<chisight>	but of course they are.
<chandeepa>	what happens if i call begin at the middle of the loop at any interruption to the rf24l+ module in rf24 library?
<chisight>	hi chandeepa
<chandeepa>	chisight actually i don't require that library as i'm completely done with the rf24 lib
<chisight>	ok.  your code was a bit odd, i found some bugs like the > being backwards.
<chisight>	pin 3 is set to output but not used, pin 13 is used but not set to output.
<chisight>	there are some local variables declared global.
<chandeepa>	chisight i've corrected them all now, this is not much complex. now it waits for delimiter to be arrived or a timeout notifies failure
<chisight>	ok.
<chisight>	i didn't see any reason for the '2'.  i left the transmission in but it did nothing.
<chandeepa>	ok
<chandeepa>	its not 2
<chisight>	ok.  it was.  the flag character.
<chandeepa>	how to reconstruct an exiting object chisight?
<chandeepa>	for example string jj=""; and in next line jj=new string() something like that?
<chisight>	as long as your messages are  no more than 32 bytes, they can all go inside one packet.
<chisight>	i don't know that.  i avoid strings like the plague.
<chisight>	i use character arrays.
<chandeepa>	i don't mean about string object but i used it as an example
<chandeepa>	the read construct is rf24
<chandeepa>	chisight
<iamtrying>	arduino yun: i am using arduino yun almost i have above 80 to 90 in use as production space. one question they are running for several months but for some reason i want to $ init 6 will it gently restart like power-cycle?
<iamtrying>	(i cant take risk)
<chisight>	no clue.  i've never run into the need to create a dynamic object, then create it again.  i would assume you'd free the old one though.
<xark>	iamtrying: you want to remote reboot?
<chandeepa>	free() removes it, but how to redeclare?
<chisight>	free removes dynamic objects.  if it was created static, you can't destroy it as far as i know.
<xark>	iamtrying: i am not sure "init 6" is a good idea, but the "telinit" command is used to switch run levels...
<iamtrying>	yes - xark (just like init 6 in linux we do)
<xark>	iamtrying: i assume you want to avoid   "shutdown -r now" (the normal reboot)?
<icepic>	since the 90s, "init 6" would be equal to "reboot" on most systems
<icepic>	at least all that pretend to use sysv init
<chandeepa>	not that construct is static chisight let me now how to redeclare?
<chisight>	chandeepa, i don't use new, never have.
<chandeepa>	mean?
<icepic>	malloc/new games on 2k ram machines sounds like a recipe for fails.
<chandeepa>	i dont want to use chisight, i ask whether there are any methods to reinitiatte
<chisight>	chandeepa, i have always used automatic storage for my instances, not dynamic storage.
<chandeepa>	chisight you ar not understanding my question
<chisight>	no, i don't think i am chandeepa.
<chandeepa>	yes you are....
<flea86>	icepic indeed
<chandeepa>	flea86 do you know how to reinitiate a variable?
<chandeepa>	or  a construct flea86
<chisight>	chandeepa, you've said what you want several different ways, all conflicting.
<chandeepa>	ok chisight i didnt call you now
<flea86>	chandeepa depends on the hardware platform imho.
<chisight>	lol flea86, nice one.
<flea86>	if we're talking attiny, it's called a temp varable :)
<chandeepa>	attiny mean? the programmer or any other?
<flea86>	chandeepa google attiny will you?
<fleck>	;p
<chandeepa>	hang on flea86
<icepic>	here is a mouth, feed it will you?
<flea86>	icepic lol
<chandeepa>	done flea86 all done, it solved
<flea86>	good
<chisight>	reading up, i think he might be trying to reset an rf24 radio object to it's initial state.  no clue why.
<chandeepa>	chisight you wont have clues as you have no knowledge on my context... when rf24 module is unplugged the code hangs. though it is connected again to the board it does not listen to incoming data or whatever the thing unless it is resetted..
<chisight>	hahaha.  i unplug occasionally, just to make sure i have registers in their power on state.  my code handles it without issue.
<chisight>	for me, i call begin() and txmode() and all is well again.  nothing more.
<chandeepa>	not working here chisight
<chisight>	you're using that rf24 lib.  i had nothing but trouble with manic's and tmr20's versions.
<chisight>	didn't mess with any other fork.
<chandeepa>	ok
<chisight>	i hat tmr20s working pretty well, but then it would die overnight for no known reason.
<chandeepa>	ok
<chisight>	never got manic's to work.
<chandeepa>	ok
<chisight>	i know the hardware is good.  it's 100% reliable now.  been about a day since either radio was hardware reset and i just launched both sides and see activity in both directions.
<bumfluff>	hi all, i have a very basic soil moisture sensor (one of the cheap ones that look like a fork) and i was wondering how many of these sensors can i run off of the uno. i know i am limited by the analog output but i wasa wondering if there is a limit in terms of the voltage the uno can supply? thanks in advance for your help.
<chandeepa>	ok
<icepic>	bumfluff: they would get 5v power from the same power source as your arduino, so if that one can handle it, then it would be ok i guess.
<icepic>	bumfluff: how many are you looking at per uno?
<blathijs>	bumfluff: you probably need to think in terms of current, not voltage. and typically, sensors need only very limited current, so my guess would be you can run quite a few (but calculations are better than guesses, of course)
<bumfluff>	icepic: 4 would be a good number
<bumfluff>	and they are rated at 3.3v and 5v
<icepic>	ok
<icepic>	still, 4 seems perfectly doable.
<icepic>	think a trinket or digistump should be fine to run one each.
<bumfluff>	great thanks for the help!
<icepic>	when you get to 20+ or so, it would become really interresting. ;)
<bumfluff>	i'm hoping to "plant" all four and take an average reading to turn on/off a pump
<bumfluff>	it's my first project so starting off modest :)
<icepic>	good luck to you then. sounds like fun and useful at the same time.
<icepic>	i just go for "blink light when watering is needed"
<bumfluff>	ha ha instead of helping my plants i'll probably drown them and quadruple my water bill! perhaps blinking leds would be wiser
<chandeepa>	chishight what you saw impossible has been done here
<chisight>	chandeepa, see if it works tomorrow without resetting it.
<chandeepa>	there are many methods to reset the hardware as well as teh firmware.. so it works nice for my project
<chisight>	i could get it to work for a few minutes, but let it sit and it would die.
<chandeepa>	*the
<chandeepa>	nope
<chandeepa>	i reset it so it works fine
<chandeepa>	ever and ever
<chisight>	i didn't want to have to touch it.  but if you're ok doing a reset then great.
<joey8>	bumfluff← i am going to do the same thing. keep us up to date of how you get on. are yuou going to blog your progress somewhere?
<bumfluff>	joey8: hadn't considered it. good idea though. although i would probably opt for publishing via google docs
<joey8>	bumfluff← ok - would love to read it sometime pj@mm.st thanx
<bumfluff>	not sure my basic project would warrant a blog :$
<joey8>	:)
<bumfluff>	joey8: i'll send you a link as soon as i have something to show :)
<stuartbegun>	i did find this book but its in german :( http://www.ornithopter.de/daten/handbuch_foto.pdf
<stuartbegun>	i'd love to know if there are actually any resources for building an ornithopter from scratch
<stuartbegun>	atleast the wing design part
<joey8>	bumfluff← have you seen this (just in case you wanna make it smaller) http://makezine.com/video/how-to-shrinkify-your-arduino-projects/
<yotson>	zap it with a coin shrinker? xd
<bumfluff>	joey8: thanks will check it out! also need to figure out some wireless communication solutions.
<joey8>	bumfluff← good luck with wireless. for some reason after struggling for a couple of hours still couldnt get it to work. so threw it in the bin! :(
<chandeepa>	how many rw cycles eeprom of mega3560 has?
<icepic>	i think the eeproms claim something like 100k cycles per byte.
<icepic>	there are ways to have it roll forward to be able to roll the "last" place forward and even out the wear.
<icepic>	http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/60342/wear-leveling-on-a-microcontrollers-eeprom
<yotson>	" the eeprom has an endurance of at least 100,000 write/erase cycles. " page 22. :)
<icepic>	i think you can be creative since 1s (or 0s, cant remember) are worse in terms of wear, so if you read it before and figure "this byte needs only to get some more bits set (or cleared)" you could do it without wiping and starting over.
<icepic>	for the really last bits of long-lasting eeprom
<icepic>	http://hackaday.com/2011/05/16/destroying-an-arduinos-eeprom/
<icepic>	 the arduino was plugged into a wall wart and sat, “behind a couch for a couple of months.” the eeprom saw it’s first write error after 47 days and 1,230,163 cycles. this is an order of magnitude better than the spec on the atmel datasheet, but similar to the results of similar experiments.
<abed007>	hello guys , i am new comer here ,and beginner  about arduino  , i want to do a project that ping many servers when they are disconnected " time out " send an email to administrator also sent sms to admin as far as i  know i require 1 unor3 and ether shield  also i need a gsm shield but i do not write a program with sketch
<icepic>	sounds almost like an rpi would be better suited.
<riotz>	you should be able to accomplish all of that with an esp8622 aswell
<riotz>	you just need an online service to send the sms then
<riotz>	esp8266
<abed007>	i know but rpi is more expensive than arduino
<abed007>	riotz:what is that esp 8622
<buzz>	esp8266 <3 <3
<riotz>	abed007 use google pls
<abed007>	ok
<riotz>	it a microcontroler with wifi access that costs 3 bucks
<abed007>	but i want to have ether port
<riotz>	yeah well.. then you have to pay the 150 bucks for your arduino setup i guess
<riotz>	or how much this stack of shields is going to cost
<p0g0_>	abed007: does each device need ethernet, or just 1, the gateway?  the esp8266 will relay network packets to a gateway with grace.
<p0g0_>	you can get a $15 router to be the gateway.
<riotz>	oh yeah another option is to get a router and flash openwrt on it
<p0g0_>	abed007: while not very busy, there is #esp8266 here on freenode.
<abed007>	p0go: i have to connect that to core switch by ether cable
<icepic>	i'm sure small arm boxes would run nagios for you and do all the above
<riotz>	then you can code in the language of choice, you have your ethernet ports
<p0g0_>	abed007: yes, you need 1 device that can do that, and act as an access point to all the nodes/stations (the esp8266s).
<riotz>	but still need an online service for the gsm stuff
<abed007>	it has to connect to local network and also it can send email trogh the internet
<p0g0_>	abed007: that would be the job of the $15 router (openwrt!)
<firehopper>	morning all
<abed007>	p0g0: in addition  i want sense temp and voltage and lighting i
<icepic>	i want a pony, also. =)
<riotz>	one that can puke rainbows pls!
<abed007>	if i wanted to ping and send email router was a good solotion
<p0g0_>	abed007: the temp and lighting are trivial- you can find esp8266 example code the the dht11 (?) reletive humidity and temp sensor,  the adc pin will read a photocell.
<p0g0_>	*relative
<p0g0_>	the voltage sensor will take a bit more effort.  the ping is easy, and so is sending an email- the openwrt router can do those out of the box, pretty much.
<pwillard>	why workoing so hard to do what a $32 raspberry pi can do?
<p0g0_>	he wants a lot of them.
<p0g0_>	the openwrt router is a one off, and can be had for $15 or so.
<riotz>	when did he say that?
<riotz>	he said he wants to ping a lot of servers
<p0g0_>	you are right, i took that to be a distributed thing,
<p0g0_>	maybe he only needs an openwrt router.
<riotz>	a raspi is maybe realy the best idea
<pwillard>	the problem is see is that the esp8266 solution will have a lot of external dependencies.  making the whole thing a house of cards...  just my opinion, of course.
<riotz>	it has an ethernet port.. all the gpios he can controll without mucking to much arround
<flea86>	pwillard maybe he doesn't like the gpio pinout either.. :p
<pwillard>	i guess in my imagination... the *sensor* can fail as much as what is being monitored if it end up being too much of a 'hack'.
<abed007>	on the other i can send command on serial port for example if have time out i can shutdown servers or restart ups
<p0g0_>	abed007: most openwrt routers have only 1 serail port, and that is mapped to the system console (you can change that if you like), so with work, you can have a serial tty port. the old wrf54g series have two com ports.
<p0g0_>	*wrt54g
<pwillard>	you *will* need to add hardware to use them...
<buzz>	there is some tplink wr703n clone, i remember
<buzz>	gl.inet?
<p0g0_>	the wrt54g routers may or may not need any more hardware for serial io- they run at 5v, so if that's right for the other end too, you can just wire them up.
<buzz>	http://www.gl-inet.com/w/?page_id=308 <-
<buzz>	some gpio pins, and full openwrt system, with ethernet port
<abed007>	what good wrt54g than ether shield ?
<p0g0_>	none
<pwillard>	p0g0_, damn i hate to say you are not right... but the serial i/o on the wrt devices is 3v ttl not 5v and it is not 5v tolerant.
<abed007>	and its price?
<p0g0_>	the wrt54g is obsolete
<buzz>	imho, ethernet shield is shit
<buzz>	but , ymmv
<pwillard>	agreed
<joey8>	buzz← mine works ok
<p0g0_>	pwillard: ok, my point is that if both ends are the same voltage, you don't need a level shifter.
<p0g0_>	it's been a long time since i've wired one up, for sure.
<p0g0_>	pwillard: fwiw, i generally like being corrected when wrong.
<pwillard>	yeah, well i have scars from the last few days of helping people not do things the wrong way.
<pwillard>	thanks... needed
<chisight>	it has been a little rough lately.
<buzz>	pwillard: we all need daily hugs
<p0g0_>	pwillard: my regrets that humans act like barnyard animals at times.  it's kinda common.
<abed007>	thanks guys  i have to search more i  will return back to ask my qustions
<pwillard>	i will add, i never consider "adding a ethernet shield" to arduino to be a solution for anything...
<buzz>	its a solution for 'i dont have enough problems'
<pwillard>	ding ding ding  you win a cigar
<flea86>	lol
<p0g0_>	i'm no fan of the arduino ethernet shield either, there are so many better solutions for that.
<pwillard>	hell, for a long time, i would add a raspberry pi to my arduino so it could have cheaper and more reliable ethernet
<icepic>	i havent tested all of them, but adding "ethernet" isnt really "adding decent tcp/ip"
<joey8>	well i have to raise my hand to using an ethernet shield. it works for me exactly how i want
<icepic>	which is why an rpi or such is a good idea if you are to take network monitoring seriously
<icepic>	"ping a lot of servers, send emails" and so on.
<yotson>	there is even bitbanged one way udp from a 16mhz avr... xd
<pwillard>	for a long time... the ethernet shield was more expensive than the raspberry pi.   and the yun is still a bad waste of money considering you can replicate it a lot cheaper.
<buzz>	^_^
<buzz>	yotson: on attiny even, right? :p
<flea86>	yotson i thought that was 20mhz..?
<flea86>	:o
<yotson>	could very well be. not sure.
<buzz>	yotson: does revspace still 'use' a lot of gl.inet boards? :p
<yotson>	i think so. we have them in the candy machine.
<pwillard>	yeah, the gl.inet seems a lot more affordable if you want to place a bunch of monitors
<buzz>	yotson: whats the price in your candymachine?
<buzz>	think i should request one through interhackerspacemail
<yotson>	iirc €27.50
<yotson>	ask foobar :)
<p0g0_>	you sell foobars (tm) in a candy machine?
<p0g0_>	sry
<yotson>	almost. mister foobar sells gl-inets though the candy machine at a hackerspace we visit.
<icepic>	the helsinki hackerspace i visited also sold electronics in the candy vending machine
<pwillard>	nice idea
<icepic>	a must-have for 'spaces, it seems.
<icepic>	"in case of emergency lack of avr, break glass"
<yotson>	coin thingy doesn't work. just pull open the door. xd
<icepic>	"push button, receive ba.. gl.inet"
<yotson>	and pay at revbank. scan barcode, type in nickname and hit enter. price is deducted from account.
<buzz>	avrs are free at our hackerspace :p
<buzz>	but we do sell usb chargers in the bar
<pwillard>	i think i have to pay to just breath the air at my local hackerspace.
<yotson>	everyone is welcome a the one i'm member of. non-members just arent allowed to stay if there are no members.
<pwillard>	totally legitimate
<yotson>	don't think we ever had issues with people coming over every day but not willing to pay membership.
<ozzzy>	there's a hackerspace just up the road from me... never been there
<ozzzy>	they have a channel here
<icepic>	i probably wont visit again, but if they use my moneys to pay for a 100th of a 3d printer or so, then its all fine
<pwillard>	usa suffers from being really spread out so good hackerspaces only exist in a few places.
<yotson>	membership is €25 a month. but if you can convince the board you cant pay that you can get a deal.
<ozzzy>	$20cad/month here
<yotson>	https://revspace.nl/gereedschap is most of what we have. you may want to visit it through google translate though.
<yotson>	as far as i know one of the few hackerspaces with a decent amount of metalworking stuff.
<yotson>	we have a light saber (plasma cutter) for example. :d
<buzz>	icepic: you donated 3 euros? :d
<yotson>	fun to play with.
<icepic>	buzz: nah, 20.
<buzz>	wow
<buzz>	expensive 3d printer
<icepic>	buzz: leaves a bit for booze also
<icepic>	they had a laser cutter from china that made a few marks in the ceiling until they got a decent cover for the beam
<yotson>	xd
<buzz>	hahaha
<pwillard>	rofl
<buzz>	i'm playing with a 1.5kw brushless motor @ space
<buzz>	amazing how much torque that has :d
<buzz>	already catapulted itself of/over/under desk a couple times
<icepic>	then again, replace that with "i am playing with a 1.5kw <anything>" and it would still amaze you with its power/heat/whatever. =)
<buzz>	i am easily amazed aswell
<icepic>	and led matrices and led bars and nixie tubes.
<buzz>	:)
<buzz>	good point, i need some ws28xx leds soon
<eulareader>	what cool stuff can i do with the ether net shield. ?
<pwillard>	all mine sit in a box being unloved
<p0g0_>	auction them, buy something cool with the proceeds.
<buzz>	eulareader: you can rub them with paint, then make fancy imprints on tshirts etc
<eulareader>	neat. i mean a real project man
<sibiria>	anyone using dick streefland's usbtiny firmwre?
<sibiria>	the arduino ide does not want to latch on to his firmware, despite having the same vid/pid as adafruit's programmer
<sibiria>	is it the device name that differs, maybe
<sibiria>	?
<yotson>	sibiria, on some linux variant?
<sibiria>	yotson: if my device is hooked up to anything linux now? it can be
<sibiria>	adafruit's device is probably also named "usbtinyisp". is it the vendor name that must be present and correct for the arduino ide to accept the device?
<zap0>	this seems about the cheapest way to add ethernet..   http://www.dx.com/p/ethernet-shield-with-wiznet-w5100-ethernet-chip-tf-slot-118061    anyone used one?
<yotson>	had to start the ide as root here to be able to use my usbtinyisp. until i made a udev rule for it.
<icepic>	zap0: i own one, lended it to a friend and he said it works.
<icepic>	zap0: might be too-good since he isnt giving it back
<icepic>	but i think esp8266 is easier, and probably cheaper too
<zap0>	icepic, do you know if there is any conflict with the network and memory card slot working simultaneously ?
<sibiria>	yotson: my udev rule for this vid/pid is ok, so it's not a permission problem. maybe i should just flash the chip with adafruit's firmware and see what it reports as
<zap0>	icepic,  this? for wireless?  http://www.dx.com/p/esp-07-esp8266-uart-serial-to-wi-fi-wireless-module-with-built-in-antenna-for-arduino-raspberry-pi-375400
<zap0>	icepic, i need to research both..  cheapest regardless of medium (wifi or cable).  and fastest/low-latency (so i presume cabled).
<buzz>	pffff
<buzz>	our hackerspace got comments from some 'activists' for not being present @ some event
<buzz>	ffs
<zap0>	lol
<buzz>	'you could be meeting potential members!'
<buzz>	yeah -right-
<zap0>	sounds like a transvestite nightclub
<buzz>	its http://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2015ams/
<buzz>	fyi
<zap0>	so it's just a meetup you have to pay to go to?     what a crock of shit
<pwillard>	well, hopefully it was *good*
<eulareader>	hmmm. excited about the arduino ethernet add on i got. hope it will expand the projects that i do.
<pwillard>	good luck.  it's not a a quick plug and play...
<buzz>	its a conference ..
<eulareader>	well ya i have to add the network. code.
<eulareader>	?
<flea86>	eulareader not everyone has a negative opinion of the ethernet shield :) i have not used it myself, but i have a friend who has and he's had few issues so far afaict
<eulareader>	sweet i'm excited about it
<eulareader>	hope it will expand my porbjects.
<flea86>	eulareader hope it does work for you - enjoy! :d
<flea86>	i mean does what you ask of it
<eulareader>	ya i hope i didn't get a bad one
<flea86>	eulareader also, i suspect you've entered this channel at a quiet time.. try coming back in oh, eight hours or so.. :)
<eulareader>	it's alright.
<eulareader>	i'm at work lol
<flea86>	lol no worries
<eulareader>	ya mon
<pwillard>	my problem with the *official* ethernet shield is that it would decide to lock up with no chance of clearing the lock up state without power cycling.  after not finding a good fix for that issue... i just "wrote off" using the ethernet shield as experience and looked for more reliable options.
<noobstar>	hey guys, i'm going through the items on a ebay store and they seem to have arduinos for 5-7$ is this legit^
<noobstar>	?*
<pwillard>	noobstar, the arduino hardware design is open source... it can be remade and sold by anyone
<zap0>	noobstar, you get what you pay for with commodity items.
<deshipu>	noobstar: as long as they don't use the trademark...
<noobstar>	right. just asking because i might buy one to have as a spare i guess
<pwillard>	they should say "compatible" in the name to be properly compliant
<deshipu>	i love the $2 pro minis :)
<noobstar>	that<s what they say
<noobstar>	a leonardo for 5$, might pick one up
<zap0>	good luck
<icepic>	the clones sometimes have other usb2serial chips, which may or may not require you to get drivers from odd places
<icepic>	dunno if everyone is comfortable with that.
<icepic>	"just run this code as root on your box and we'll install something that talks serial. and then some"
<icepic>	and helpful (?) guides that go: so i downloaded the driver, installed it and rebooted my mbp. plugged in the arduino clone, yup you guessed it, still no port detected. by now i’m thinking that i received dead boards. so i did some more digging. turns out that the driver isn’t signed and in yosemite, driver files must be signed to be used. there’s a command we can issue to bypass this.
<pwillard>	;-)
<noobstar>	so might not be worth the trouble in some cases, huh
<noobstar>	just going through this shop, seems to have some cool stuff. cmos camera module lense for instance could be cool to have
<icepic>	im just saying that saving a few bucks but having to install strange drivers on your laptop may be a net loss, in the long run
<pwillard>	yup
<pwillard>	but the flap of arduino.org versus arduino.cc also creates a "who am i supporting" delemma... which is sad... since it used to be so clear that you wanted to support arduino by buying official items
<blathijs>	!tell noobstar about clones
<icepic>	i accidentally got a zero pro, and now i think i may have supported the wrong team. 8-/
<blathijs>	!tell noobstar about clones
<grobbebol>	noobstar: clones is http://blog.arduino.cc/2013/07/10/send-in-the-clones/
<noobstar>	thx
<chandeepa>	rf24l+ another q
<chandeepa>	anyone?
<deshipu>	chandeepa: just ask the question already
<deshipu>	seriously
<chandeepa>	deshipu i have no prob with the coding i've just uploaded the gettingstarted example sketches to two arduino boards and connected nrf24l+ modules to them and one module does not receive or transmit. they were successfully working earlier with my own sketches and now its not working with them either
<djhenjin>	teensy 3.1 is supported directly by the current arduino ide correct?
<chandeepa>	deshipu answer me i'll be here after my dinner
<deshipu>	chandeepa: i won't answer, but if anybody else knows, they will
<deshipu>	djhenjin: not out of the box
<deshipu>	djhenjin: you need to add the board definition, afaik
<djhenjin>	thanks deshipu, do you know of a compatible out of box solution for running on a windows platform for teensy dev? i have had mine for a few months and not done anything with it yet aside from loading the blinky demo onto it.
<djhenjin>	every time i try looking for anything i come up empty handed
<deshipu>	djhenjin: i think they have a download on the teensy page
<djhenjin>	from what i recall, they only have the loader but no compiler
<deshipu>	djhenjin: i thought the have the full arduino ide
<djhenjin>	they have a version for the teensyduino board, not for specifically the teensy 3.1 which is specifically mentioned as not supported by the versions which support previous versions of the teensy
<firehopper>	djhenjin, i'm running teensyduino on 1.0.6 i think
<firehopper>	and it works just fine on on a teensy 3.1
<firehopper>	yup 1.0.6
<deshipu>	djhenjin: i used that teensyduino to upload micropython to my teensy 3.1, it worked just fine
<djhenjin>	thanks, ill try that out
<firehopper>	i'm using a teensy 3.1 with a smartmatrix board to drive a 32x32 rgb matrix
<djhenjin>	cool, i have wanted to do some work with led dot matrix displays
<chandeepa>	can nr24l+ module can reach distances of 1km practically with antenna?
<firehopper>	https://www.flickr.com/photos/firehopper/15771823423/in/dateposted-public/ < djhenjin
<djhenjin>	nice!
<firehopper>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=codr1wp8eho < demo code #1
<firehopper>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlq4zy-dkfu < demo code #2
<djhenjin>	ill take a look in a few minutes
<firehopper>	using smartmartix and or fastled lib's
<firehopper>	didnt code em, those are canned demos. pre written, just compiled and loaded em
<djhenjin>	that may be so, still apreciate the video demos as i do not have a 32x32 rgb dot matrix display to play with yet
<chandeepa>	anyone know about transceivers which are compatible with arduino(with libraries) which has a range of 1km
<firehopper>	1km range? thats gonna cost
<eulareader>	ummm hmmm
<blathijs>	chandeepa: xbee has a few of those, the eu version going up to 40km line of sight with a regular antenna i think
<firehopper>	i dont know if the 60mw xbee's can go that far.
<flamethrower>	hi guys is anybody here familiar with ethernet shield ?
<chandeepa>	blathijs can you please suggest me one
<chandeepa>	blathijs : please note that i dont want to use shields
<blathijs>	chandeepa: iirc it's the xbee-pro 868lp. if you're in the us, the xbee-pro 900 could be useful (less range, but still > 1km i think)
<chandeepa>	blathijs please let me check it out
<blathijs>	chandeepa: you're welcome to connect the xbee modules in whatever way you feel like, they only need a single bidirectional uart connection
<chandeepa>	serial on arduino?
<blathijs>	(there might be other long-range modules, but these are the ones i'm aware of)
<blathijs>	chandeepa: yes
<chandeepa>	thanks blatijs, but please let me check those out
<chandeepa>	blathijs what would be the price of the modules you've just mentioned?
<znoosey>	blister: we have used these before (not this actual model but the previous one) and got 1km out of that, this should be better: http://shop.ciseco.co.uk/arf-version-2-high-power-radio-transceiver/
<znoosey>	blathijs*
<chandeepa>	blathijs answered me znoosey
<chandeepa>	i'll check those out too
<znoosey>	chandeepa: ah :)
<chandeepa>	znoosey :d
<chandeepa>	znoosey any other modules you know?
<znoosey>	chandeepa: yes, but not as good, and not that i can remember the name of right now
<chandeepa>	hmm znoosey, do you know anything about nrf24l+ module
<chandeepa>	?
<chandeepa>	its range with antenna of 2.4ghz
<znoosey>	chandeepa: nope
<chandeepa>	hmmm.. anyway thanks znoosey
<chandeepa>	uart defines the serial connectionn on arduino am i right znoosey?
<buzz>	universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter, abbreviated uart
<chandeepa>	thanks buzz
<chandeepa>	buzz anyway let me know whether this module is great http://www.lankatronics.com/modules-and-sensors/rf/cc2500l-long-distance-wireless-module-pa-lna.html
<buzz>	cc2500?
<buzz>	it has some fans
<buzz>	i'm not one ;)
<buzz>	although i love ti's stuff
<buzz>	these cc modules are passed relevance
<buzz>	ever since esp8266 exists, all these modules have become totally worth- and pointless
<buzz>	imho
<chandeepa>	buzz can you mention more detial?
<chandeepa>	buzz i don't want wifi modules but a simple transceiver module
<buzz>	it -is- supersimple :d
<chandeepa>	i dont want wifi, just  send me a module which support uart
<chandeepa>	with 1km range
<chandeepa>	i suppose you are still alive buzz
<pwillard>	will you please try an control yourself... we are all "still here" and can "read" you.
<pwillard>	here... have some reading material   http://www.digi.com/products/zigbee-rf-modules/zigbee-mesh-module/
<chandeepa>	anyway thanks pwillard
<chandeepa>	i'll check on
<chandeepa>	pwillard i want some other help too, how to find xbee that range is approved in sri lanka
<chandeepa>	i think its spectrum monitoring
<pwillard>	that is totally *your* issue to resolve, sorry
<chandeepa>	well pwillard..... did you know or do you know something about that nrf24l+ modules?
<pwillard>	i could give you perfect advice, but if you can't do it where you live... that doesn't mean *anything*, does it?
<chandeepa>	i can do, let me know do you know about nrf24l+
<pwillard>	i have some nrf24l modules in my parts pin... not used them yet.
<pwillard>	bin, rather
<chandeepa>	hmm pwillard is it true that they can transmit over 1km with 2.4ghz antenna?
<pwillard>	are you an engineering student?
<chandeepa>	no, i'm still doing my a/l in sri lanka
<chandeepa>	i'm 17
<buzz>	i have seen over 100km with 2.4ghz
<buzz>	frequency doesnt matter much
<pwillard>	nrf series devices can do 1km with the right antenna
<chandeepa>	hey hey buzz i think it matters the module
<chandeepa>	very well pwillard
<pwillard>	and you need the right module to attach the correct antenna
<buzz>	yes, radio used matters
<buzz>	frequency doesnt
<buzz>	just saying '2.4ghz' says nothing about range
<pwillard>	http://yourduino.com/sunshop2/index.php?l=product_detail&p=190 for example
<chandeepa>	pwillard : i want another help too, my modules were perfectly fine working with my own sketch and i was resetting the module on failure... now one module does not rx neither tx even with the gettingstarted example in the library
<pwillard>	i will say 3 words.    "made in china"   it sounds plausible... based on your explanation... that the module no longer contains the magic that makes it work.
<pwillard>	or... you have a broken/missing connection
<chandeepa>	i don't think i have missing connection pwillard, both did fine using my own sketch earlier, then now it fails. so i tried gettingstarted sketches. the mistery is both modules are detected correctly
<djhenjin>	higher frequencies have a reduction in penetration power, ie going through obstacles, and also can carry data at a higher rate. lower frequencies with their reduced data rates also have a better penetrating power.
<xxvaliumxx>	it is far too easy to shop online.
<xxvaliumxx>	i just bought a laser engraver.
<chandeepa>	djhenjin thanks for info
<xxvaliumxx>	i have no actual use for such a device.  maybe i'll customize pencils or something.
<djhenjin>	chandeepa, you can increase the penetrating power of both higher and lower frequencies by increasing the transmission intensity, either by using more power to transmit, or by using a directional antennae set to extend the distance in a certain direction.
<loshki>	xxvaliumxx: so how much does a laser engraver you don't need, cost?
<xxvaliumxx>	about us$130
<chandeepa>	very well djhenjin did you read my problem on nrf24l+ module?
<xxvaliumxx>	it's a clone of the "laser cube"
<xxvaliumxx>	didn't know that at the time.
<loshki>	xxvaliumxx: not bad, actually...
<djhenjin>	i have no experience with that module, and know my previous info from ham radio licensure
<sibiria>	xxvaliumxx: what kind of effect can it output?
<xxvaliumxx>	but it's from dealextreme, so go figure.
<xxvaliumxx>	sibiria supposedly 300mw
<sibiria>	strong enough to engrave plastics?
<chandeepa>	hmm ok djhenjin, here i recall pwillard it blocks on write and has no capability of reading
<xxvaliumxx>	sibiria that's what it indicates.
<xxvaliumxx>	it uses an arduino running grbl at least.
<chandeepa>	hey it completed the mistery pwillard, i just unplugged gnd and it works!!
<theseven>	er...
<eulareader>	can i use ultrasonic range finders. outside?
<eulareader>	they work find inside
<eulareader>	but can i put them in my car?
<chandeepa>	not working pwillard when i unplug the ground it sends something
<xxvaliumxx>	got a new ht as well, tired of trying to carry this huge old icom
<xxvaliumxx>	ooh..it can engrave abs.  lego bricks are abs...
<snath>	any suggestions for good prices on neopixel/ws2812b ?
<theseven>	5m 60leds/m waterproof is ~$50
<theseven>	and draws about 15a of power when fully on ;)
<theseven>	can be a real pain to get that to where you need it ;)
<sharpererer>	im planning a wearable project with a large amount of leds(700+) via 8 144/m 2812 strips- i have a 20000mah usb battery that i'm planning on using to drive the leds at about 50% brightness, never full white so i think i'll be ok on power.  my questions is - how do i physically wire the battery to the strips?  so i just strip the usb cable and find the power/ground and solder?
<xxvaliumxx>	you give power to the strips seperately
<xxvaliumxx>	oh, you meant hte usb cable from the charger
<xxvaliumxx>	erm... you might wan't to check what the output current is on that battery.
<theseven>	sharpererer: er... 700 leds at 50% will be about 90w of power
<theseven>	your powerbank probably provides about 10w
<djhenjin>	and, 700 leds even at 50% power is going to be quite an illuminating spectacle
<theseven>	yes
<theseven>	and will need rather thick wires for those 20 amps of current
<djhenjin>	not to mention pwm's to accurately do power limiting/ reduction of consumption by taking advantage of persistence of vision
<theseven>	to power it i'd probably use a >=12v li-polymer battery and a little buck smps module at both ends of every strip
<theseven>	assuming you really want that rather insane amount of brightness
<djhenjin>	i'd be worried about heat buildup at the connections
<theseven>	if you do those adequately that's manageable
<djhenjin>	fair enough
<theseven>	the resistance of the traces inside the strip is usually the bottleneck with these things
<theseven>	even with 60leds/m strips i'd use a power supply point every meter or so
<snath>	ok, suggestions where to find the product with good prices?
<sibiria>	ebay/aliexpress
<theseven>	http://www.aliexpress.com/item//32227572562.html is what i ordered
<sibiria>	you should be able to find that for half the price, same length
<sharpererer>	yeah im not particularly worried about insane amounts of brightness
<theseven>	sibiria: huh? where? not at qty=1 for sure
<sharpererer>	im sure even 30% brightness would be fine
<theseven>	sharpererer: probably more like 10%... remember that 25% is basically perceived as 50% etc.
<sharpererer>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-oseh8kgcw
<sharpererer>	this application used a less powerful battery for essentially the same effect
<sibiria>	theseven: just taking a few seconds to look at the suggestions from other sellers revealed this: http://www.aliexpress.com/item/5m-roll-smd-5050-rgb-led-strip-5050-waterproof-horse-race-chasing-dream-color-270-led/1692879066.html
<theseven>	i'm sure that this one doesn't go above 10% brightness
<theseven>	sibiria: that's completely different technology, with groups of 3 leds being controllable, not individual leds
<sharpererer>	yeah well thats fine and trivial to modify
<sharpererer>	im wondering about the physical connection to the strips...
<theseven>	how would you modify that?
<alvarops>	hey guys
<alvarops>	just saw that humble bundle has a make bundle
<theseven>	also this looks like a 32 leds/m strip, not 60
<sharpererer>	strip.setpixelcolor
<alvarops>	have you seen it yet?
<sharpererer>	that is a 144/m strip
<sharpererer>	http://www.enviral-design.com/portfolio/the-all-seeing-eye-704-led-top-hat/
<theseven>	oh, thought that was referring to the aliexpress link above
<alvarops>	https://www.humblebundle.com/books
<sharpererer>	build details
<sharpererer>	ah it looks like he used a usb adapter to power a protoboard
<arkaoss82>	how do i add support for sanguinololu boards? i downloaded some sort of board package .. and copied it into my arduino folder
<poppavic>	honestly? i'm more and more of the opinion that no one not developing the ide has a clue (and i suspect those guys as well)
<sibiria>	theseven: it's odd you refer to it as "technology", but you're right, at that density - 60 leds per meter - it would probably be a challenge finding it cheaper per meter
<poppavic>	arkaoss82:  start by finding the nearest board-type? or, are you hoping you can stuff files in a folder and it just works?
<sibiria>	they come as low as 20 and 30 leds per meter, too, iirc
<arkaoss82>	@poppavic: what do you mean by nearest board type?
<poppavic>	@?
<poppavic>	as in the processor
<arkaoss82>	i know theres a board manager.. but i dont see an import
<theseven>	sibiria: what you linked is based on separate ws2811 controller chips + 3 leds in series + external resistors, powered by 12v
<arkaoss82>	usbtinyisp?
<sibiria>	usbtinyisp is what i'd try first
<azv4>	anyone know of a 2.54mm dual row socket for 1.27mm flat ribbon cable?
<sibiria>	i suppose that's the suitable bootloader they flashed on their chips
<arkaoss82>	who flashed? norcal-reprap? god knows.. they are out of business
<sibiria>	hm, well, there might be a chance you have a blank atmega on that board
<sibiria>	which would explain why there is no on-chip programmer responding over usb-serial
<timemage>	azv4, yo mean like 1.27mm idc to .3/.6inch dip?
<arkaoss82>	@sibiria: blank? it responds to stuff from pronterface
<azv4>	i have a ribbon cable with micromatch connectors and is 1.27 pitch, i want to cut one end off and crimp on something that will be 2.54
<sibiria>	arkaoss82: i'll rephrase: it may not contain a bootloader that listens on the serial port for reprogramming
<sibiria>	meaning you will have to go isp on the thing to update the software
<arkaoss82>	@sibiria: isp = internet service provider?
<sibiria>	in-system programming
<sibiria>	the constitutional method for programming the atmega chips
<arkaoss82>	arduino as isp?
<sibiria>	feed the chip power, and hook 4 wires to its isp port
<arkaoss82>	wait.. i have to have 12 v on?
<sibiria>	if you have another arduino you can use that, yes
<sibiria>	well, 5v
<sibiria>	no need to power the entire board for programming the atmega
<sibiria>	power it over usb will work just fine
<arkaoss82>	ok i have it usb connected.
<sibiria>	you still need an external programmer, though
<arkaoss82>	should i flash a bootloader?
<arkaoss82>	you mean a board other than the sanguino? i hope not
<sibiria>	no other way
<sibiria>	your board's usb-to-serial portion is not connected to the chip's isp port
<sibiria>	external programmer is what's needed, whether it's a second arduino or a dedicated programmer
<arkaoss82>	loverly..
<sibiria>	mind you, this is just one possible reason why the board won't respond when you try to reflash it
<sibiria>	the problem could be something else
<arkaoss82>	gotcha.. i only need to reflash it because the endstops are reversed.. if i get a soldering iron i can fix it.
<longhorn__>	i have yun and i'd like to 1) change the hotspot name to a custom one and 2) put an encryption on the connection and 3) use this new configuration as the default on every boot. i have been googling around this, but can't find a good help on this, help anyone?
<longhorn__>	wow, i just found probably what i want by chance by editing the current connection from luci/network/wifi
<arkaoss82>	is there any way with arduino software to see what bootloader is instaleld?
<sibiria>	you could try talking to the device with avrdude and ask for verbosity
<sibiria>	there might be some serial command to send to it as well - i'm not really certain of what extra functionality the bootloaders offer
<arkaoss82>	avrdude?
<sibiria>	the software the arduino ide calls for talking to the chip
<sibiria>	it's included with the ide
<arkaoss82>	ok, i thought you where saying before that the boot loader was what was responsible for not letting me be able to re-flash it
<sibiria>	the lack of a bootloader
<sibiria>	since it appears it doesn't want to talk with avrdude on the serial port
<sibiria>	if you use avrdude on the command line, you can try dig a little deeper
<sibiria>	if you get nothing out of the device, the likeliest is that it does not contain a "standard" bootloader that allows for reprogramming the chip
<arkaoss82>	@sibiria: thanks .. i dont have time right now to talk to it via command.. i can try again later... or try to use it as is when i get time after my move.
<timemage>	poppavic, one of those is a cruel thing to do.
<poppavic>	timemage:  well, like i said: share the pain. ok, add sh and even bash if you like.. tcl..
<systemloc>	pwillard: true enough
<systemloc>	is there any place you would recommend for help using eclipse with arduino?
<pwillard>	omg  tcl... was painful
<poppavic>	i never managed to use it - just staring at it hurts the eyes
<timemage>	poppavic, well, iirc, everything is a string.
<pwillard>	most references are going to be stale, keep that in mind systemloc
<poppavic>	systemloc:  whoever supports the plugin?
<poppavic>	..and given the new releases of the ide, with the ever-changing filepathspecs and macro-names.. good luck.
<timemage>	systemloc, you want eclipse because you like eclipse or because of some sort of requirement?
<systemloc>	timemage: if there's a better ide that integrates well with the arduino, i'd use that.
<timemage>	systemloc, hmm, if you qualify "better" and better than what, you may get some good suggestions.
<poppavic>	better to ask "what else is there?" and suffer the links/tests ;-)
<timemage>	systemloc, well, i see people here being pushed to codebender.cc
<xxvaliumxx>	does anyone here use grbl?
<systemloc>	timemage: i just want something that is easy for a beginner to use, runs on linux, not too hard to set up, allows the use of the arduino sdk and wiring sdk, and has a decent editor. i don't like a lot of behind the scenes magic and the arduino ide is a bit childish looking
<poppavic>	i've had a few hamsters.. butt, never used a gerbil
<timemage>	poppavic, butt? =)
<poppavic>	timemage:  just sew ;-)
<xxvaliumxx>	oh god.
<poppavic>	systemloc:  not much chance.
<systemloc>	poppavic: which is why i'm screaming at eclipse
<systemloc>	poppavic: what else is there? :-p
<poppavic>	systemloc:  i've tried several "ide"'s and each looks better and then has issues.
<sibiria>	why would the visual appearance of the ide even be a concern?
<sibiria>	do you need to feel like tom cruise in minority report when developing? :)
<systemloc>	sibiria: childish, as in no options to customize compiler flags, no multi-file support
<sibiria>	one alternative is to just use your favorite text-editor and do the rest with makefiles
<poppavic>	codebender is webware; eclipse, uecide, subversion, arduinoide. sudar's makefile
<systemloc>	no console to view output of the compiler and linker
<poppavic>	ide? looks? how about: "it's not c, asm or c++ - it's "arduino"?"
<sibiria>	plenty of text-editors around that offer project functionality, and allows you to execute from within the editor, to get that "integrated" experience
<ozzzy>	it's both c and c++ with a wrapper
<timemage>	systemloc, there is actually a place to modify the compiler options.  in a configuration file though.
<poppavic>	systemloc:  geany has an inbuilt termwin.. although any idiot can open a termwin and gui program
<timemage>	systemloc, on the 1.5/1.6 line, platform.txt
<timemage>	systemloc, you can also run the arduino command with command-line parameters.  if you wanted you could probably just use a normal eclipse cpp project but just use the edit.  create buttons to launch arduino the command-line options to compile/upload.
<timemage>	systemloc, i'm usually using the command-line version or leaving the ide open with the external editor option turned on. from there, vim usually.  but any editor.  if you're used to eclipse maybe something closer to notepad++.
<systemloc>	timemage: that's a nice idea
<poppavic>	it's still amusing that you must do these things.
<timemage>	systemloc, not sure which one you're talking about, but okay.
<systemloc>	timemage: using vim or notepad++ as an external editor to the ide
<poppavic>	oh, not "subversion" - "sublime"
<timemage>	poppavic, not a large group of "power users" i guess.  i can see how if you were teaching a class you'd want fewer things to click on.  not sure what's keeping them from using progressive disclosure, except time.
<poppavic>	timemage:  yeah, i get "monkey simple" as useful.. until it's a burden. whitewashing it as "better" to remain monkey-simple is just noise.
<timemage>	poppavic, i know almost nothing about the development team.  my only guess on that is the more complex it is made the more there is to maintain.  that may be a driving factor.
<poppavic>	<shrug> i've tried to follow some of the lists.. looks like they are fighting more with the {macro.names", filenames, paths and entire heirarchy - plus java - more than the semi-c++ and c
<timemage>	poppavic, at some point it makes sense for them to stop enhancing the ide and write official maintained plugins for other ides.
<poppavic>	timemage:  i find that unlikely.
<timemage>	poppavic, any reason why?
<poppavic>	i think they are too invested in their little "community" and java.. looks like even the 3rd-part folks are getting irked at having to rewrite/package their boards.txt and whatnot.
<timemage>	poppavic, actually, now that i think of it, that's more or less the tact taken by atmel and ti.
<poppavic>	timemage:  which? writing plugins?
<timemage>	poppavic, well, atmel's ide is basically visual studio.  ti's ide is eclipse slightly rebranded and with their plugins/tools added.  dunno what atmel was doing, but iirc ti were previously doing own ide.
<poppavic>	yes, that energia thing
<timemage>	poppavic, hmm, nope. i mean ti.
<poppavic>	everyone wanders off to their own brand of ide-mess
<timemage>	poppavic, if you download their development tools for the msp430 (e.g.), it's modified eclipse.
<poppavic>	yep
<eulareader>	hi
<flea86>	o/
<timemage>	poppavic, well, it makes sense if the arduino team can make a better eclipse integration than others.  i think it's pretty reasonable to expect they can.  i'm sure someone made an aweful msp430 package for eclipse before ti made their own.
<poppavic>	i'm not much of a fan of "ide"'s since the turbo days.. i'm happy if you can write code, include headers, link libs and holler "compile! upload!" - without wondering which contributor broke which java fragment i should never have cared about to start with ;->
<eulareader>	hahaha true poppavic
<timemage>	poppavic, well, that more or less goes back to my experience with a eclipse.  so far this hasn't been the case for the specialized copies of it though.
<timemage>	poppavic, about quarterly i have to figure who/what broke my android dev setup.
<sibiria>	ec*freeze*lip*freeze*se
<poppavic>	timemage:  happily, i've avoided android so far. ubuntu-flavored linux works.
<ozzzy>	android works fine
<timemage>	ozzzy, i've had good luck with it.  if i could ask them for one thing, it would the ability to basically put apps in the twilight zone.   if an app claims it needs to see your incoming calls, or media files, or internet access, you could be able to accept the app but route those services to some fakery.
<ozzzy>	that would be nice
<timemage>	ozzzy, sort of like a permission veto system.
<timemage>	ozzzy, it's funny, this user receives no calls.  and there never seems to be an access point available.  oh well.
<baldengineer>	timemage at which point, it'll just assume it'd a 25 year old in a parent's basement
<timemage>	baldengineer, any reason why that would be a problem for a sudoku program?
<baldengineer>	only if it insults you on failure.  wouldn't want inaccurate insults.  that'd be insulting.
<ozzzy>	mmm sudoku
<timemage>	baldengineer, i trust you get the idea though.
<baldengineer>	yeah, i agree with it
<ozzzy>	i might figure out something useful for my nexus to do when the odbii bt-dongle comes in
<azv3>	http://pastebin.com/q19l6vjc
<azv3>	i've checked my lights 3 times now
<azv3>	4x5 grid of leds, resistors connected to anodes
<azv3>	can anyone see from that code why no leds lighting?
<timemage>	azv3, what happens if you setpattern instead?
<azv3>	timemage, setpattern happens in setup()
<timemage>	azv3, i mean instead of slidepattern
<azv3>	you cant setpattern instead of slidepattern
<azv3>	do you know how to c at all?
<timemage>	azv3, how to c?
<timemage>	azv3, good luck then.
<poppavic>	yes, ##c is down the hall.
<azv3>	timemage, setpattern is part of the setup() routine, are you asking why i haven't tried putting the setup in the loop() too?
<timemage>	azv3, not what i was suggesting.
<azv3>	not sure what you were suggesting then...
<eryn_1983_fl>	hi peeps
<eryn_1983_fl>	i am trying to make a  dress similar to this one https://vimeo.com/38220385
<eryn_1983_fl>	for my wedding
<azv3>	here is some more simple code: http://pastebin.com/whxzlcva
<azv3>	all lights are on
<azv3>	which i believe is desired
<azv3>	how do i turn only one light on?
<timemage>	eryn_1983_fl, heh, wow.
<azv3>	30,32,34,36 are columns, with resistor and anodes, 31,33,35,37,39 are rows
<flea86>	eryn_1983_fl, very modern :d
<samy^^>	okay guys
<timemage>	eryn_1983_fl, you'll have to be careful with the patterns.  otherwise someone may have a seizure.  :)
<samy^^>	super excited to release a new arduino app in the morning!
<eryn_1983_fl>	well it dont got to be like like that
<eryn_1983_fl>	i am not sure i can afford that much led
<samy^^>	eryn_1983_fl: awesome!
<timemage>	eryn_1983_fl, yeah, i know.  neat though.
<eryn_1983_fl>	indeed,
<eryn_1983_fl>	i got like a year is that enough time to learn how to do this like a few hours a week?
<eryn_1983_fl>	code build etc?
<azv3>	shouldn't this light only 1 led? http://pastebin.com/qtdpdxik
<samy^^>	eryn_1983_fl: i suggest using something like teensy with octows2811 https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_octows2811.html
<samy^^>	eryn_1983_fl: absolutely
<flea86>	eryn_1983_fl given the cost of some wedding dresses, leds are a cheap expense :)
<eryn_1983_fl>	ok i got a sysadmin background just no coding or ee stuff yet
<eryn_1983_fl>	lol yeah gf wants to make the  dress and i do the eletrical work.
<flea86>	eryn_1983_fl lol nice one
<timemage>	eryn_1983_fl, fortunately addressable leds are pretty popular right now.  should be a fair number of resources to pull from.
<eryn_1983_fl>	now if i can save enough money for the engagment ring..
<samy^^>	eryn_1983_fl: this was a week or two (mostly soldering) without any ee knowledge - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kapacpjphg8
<azv3>	if you want all lights to just stay solid, you don't have much to learn to get up and running
<azv3>	just need a battery, a bunch of leds, some wire and solder, and something to regulate voltage
<eryn_1983_fl>	sweet
<eryn_1983_fl>	yeah i just want some patterns to add to it then i think i am done,
<azv3>	you want to send 3 or so volts through them wired parallel with about 25 ma per led i think
<azv3>	patterns are going to require a micro controller
<eryn_1983_fl>	yup
<azv3>	i spend a bunch of hours wiring this grid, now im trying to figure out how to address single lights so i can do some patterns, and its a real pain i say!
<azv3>	i cant get it to light a single led
<eryn_1983_fl>	lol
<azv3>	it always does a whole column
<flea86>	eryn_1983_fl: wedding ring? get one of these in gold: http://i.ytimg.com/vi/o8pticayn3o/maxresdefault.jpg
<flea86>	:d
<eryn_1983_fl>	lol
<eryn_1983_fl>	is that  real?
<eryn_1983_fl>	i might want one
<flea86>	eryn_1983_fl good question. possible? yes, practical? who knows..
<poppavic>	cigar band - yer out less in the end
<flea86>	heh
<eryn_1983_fl>	nah i am going for stainless steel band and some amthesyst and peridot stones with a  diamond in the middle
<samy^^>	eryn_1983_fl: flea86: i ordered one of those rings a year or two ago...still haven't received it
<flea86>	samy^^ wat.. must be harder to make than i initially thought :)
<poppavic>	there is a shortage of admantium
<flea86>	lol
<samy^^>	poppavic: they've swapped it out with unobtanium
<timemage>	samy^^, and cylindric diamacron.
<poppavic>	ah, so yer getting a free upgrade - in some nebulous future
<poppavic>	..sounds like my last ebay order
<poppavic>	i not only never got the first order, i've never gotten the "free" shipment they said they were sending in apology for the first order.
<eryn_1983_fl>	lol
<eryn_1983_fl>	guess i better save my money then
<poppavic>	yes, that vendor is in my "never again" bucket
<eryn_1983_fl>	i bet
<eryn_1983_fl>	how much went down the  drain
<poppavic>	well, it was only a couple arm mini boards, headers, etc - i got a refund eventually, but after they even promised to send a 2nd order that i only need to pay 80% for! ;-p
<eryn_1983_fl>	:(
<poppavic>	<shrug> tinxi-clothes isn't getting any more order from me, and i'll get the stuff from elsewhere about the same price.
<kabu_>	hello guys
<kabu_>	how do i save a file opened in the arduino yun with putty
<kabu_>	?
<timemage>	kabu_, having a hard time parsing that here.
<chandeepa>	hi nrf24l+ modules... :d
<chandeepa>	why does nrf24l+ receives data to a command sent to the other module after unplugging 5v supply
<chandeepa>	?
<chandeepa>	and let me know whether the cc2500l is a good choice(where good library exist) to tx and rx 1km range? sometimes even vids?
<kabu_>	sorry timemage
<kabu_>	went afk for a while
<kabu_>	but i figured out how to do it
<timemage>	kabu_, cool.
<kabu_>	how do you guys navigate through arduino's directorys?
<kabu_>	i need to find a file but i don't know where it is
<chandeepa>	better using general c kabu_
<kabu_>	general c?
<kabu_>	what do you mean?
<kabu_>	changedeepa
<timemage>	kabu_, not sure what you mean by navigate.  i'm on linux most of the time i'm messing with it, so locating things with find ~/arduino -iname whatever  or using ctags
<chandeepa>	kabu_ let me know are you reading a file or bytes in sd card or something?
<chandeepa>	timemage do you know about nrf24l+ modules?
<kabu_>	by navigate i mean going through the directorys
<kabu_>	for example..
<kabu_>	in windows you use "cd" to go into a directory
<timemage>	chandeepa, i don't have any of them and no experience with them other than trying to help others which has been hit-or-miss.
<chandeepa>	ah its ok timemage
<kabu_>	andi f you want to see the list of directorys
<kabu_>	you use..
<timemage>	chandeepa, i have thought about getting some though.
<chandeepa>	kabu_ well.... do you want to fetch the list all dir s?
<chandeepa>	timemage are you willing to use them?
<kabu_>	yes
<chandeepa>	kabu_ not a sd card right?
<kabu_>	i guess if that is the only way to find a file
<kabu_>	i have an sd card inside
<kabu_>	but don't know if the file i'm searching for is inside of the sd card
<chandeepa>	well, let me know yes or not, kabu_ do you want to read sd card or computer file?
<timemage>	chandeepa, willing?
<kabu_>	chandeepa i don't know where is the file
<chandeepa>	timemage : willing=hoping
<kabu_>	if the file is inside the sd card or the arduino
<chandeepa>	kabu_ : then you want to search both the computer and the sd card for the file using arduino sketch right?
<chandeepa>	timemage are you going to buy that stuff?
<kabu_>	i'm actually using putty
<timemage>	chandeepa, i have some projects that might be nice to have wireless.  a lot of times i don't have a specific purpose for things, just get them play with them, and then it becomes somewhat less effort to apply them when i have a need later.
<chandeepa>	timemage i advice you not to buy those, they have much hardware complexicity and library bugs. data loss occurs most of the time...
<timemage>	chandeepa, as long as there's a decent datasheet for the part and the hardware itself isn't flakey, i don't mind.
<chandeepa>	timemage yes datasheet is better, i stuggled hard to get my sketch done but anyway its working.. you have to deal with the clock of the arduino
<timemage>	chandeepa, what about its clock?
<chandeepa>	kabu_ i don't want to know about the interface you are using, but instead i want to know the answer for above q
<chandeepa>	timemage clock is used to avoid dataloss
<kabu_>	yes
<kabu_>	changedeepa
<chandeepa>	yes=both on arduino and computer kabu_ ?
<chandeepa>	timemage actually it is not hard... but you have to be tricky for eg : using micros() ans millis() in appropiate manner
<kabu_>	yes, on both
<timemage>	chandeepa, you mean because the radio itself doesn't provide any flow control or something else?
<chandeepa>	yes timemage ... flow is ok but for example if one arduino sketch is not listening and the other is transmitting to that module, that data is not accepted to the buffer and is lost forever
<chandeepa>	kabu_ you must have more knowledge on arduino filesystem objects and c file handling(http://www.studytonight.com/c/file-input-output.php_
<chandeepa>	(http://www.studytonight.com/c/file-input-output.php)
<timemage>	chandeepa, sounds fairly normal.  so, maybe i should ask, you have an alternative module where that isn't a problem?
<chandeepa>	i suggest xbee modules timemage
<chandeepa>	they have even a huge range with lower frequencies which can penetrate better
<chandeepa>	such as 866mhz
<timemage>	chandeepa, 900 some here probably.
<chandeepa>	timemage what do you mean by 900?
<timemage>	chandeepa, depending on what part of the world you're in, different valid operating frequency.
<chandeepa>	ah well well i understand your issue, i'm in sri lanka
<chandeepa>	timemage
<timemage>	chandeepa, you've used them though?
<chandeepa>	i don't own xbee but i do own rf24
<timemage>	chandeepa, a while back i started reading to sort out xbee and zigbee and eventually gave up and went onto other things.  looked like a mess.
<chandeepa>	timemage : what do you see as a mess there?
<chandeepa>	it comes with uart which makes it very much easier to communicate. just only serial comm
<chisight>	bummer poppavic,  tinxi-clothes has been on my preferred list for awhile.  of course if you're having trouble, i imagine it would only be time before i do too and it might be a good idea to drop them here too.
<timemage>	chandeepa, iirc, different versions are implementations of zigbee, but somehow not compatible with other zigbee, and apparently some xbee module are not compatible with others.
<timemage>	chandeepa, at least, that's what i got out of it.
<timemage>	chandeepa, plus, i seem to remember they were one of the more expensive options.
<poppavic>	yeah, ymmv - they were responsive, but nothing happened - over and over.. getting the money back was enough, but if their free package had arrived, i might have ordered there again
<chandeepa>	incompatibility? you just have to purchase same transceiver modules for both ends
<kabu_>	wtf
<chandeepa>	somewhat expensive timemage but if you need a long range, it is a great solution
<chandeepa>	kabu_ now what?
<chandeepa>	anyone with a sound knowledge on rf24?
<chisight>	timemage, was reading back...  the nrf24l01+ hardware is very stable for me now.  using what's even labeled as a clone and as long as you avoid the rf24 libs by manic and the forks, they are very stable.  recommended.
<chandeepa>	chisight i think you have a good knowledge on rf24
<chisight>	chandeepa, not as well as 7 but yes.
<chisight>	not much on that lib though, i use my own lib only.
<chandeepa>	chisight let me know about why one of the modules is detected by gettingstarted but not transmitting?
<chandeepa>	i don't want to need about th elibs
<chandeepa>	its on hardware
<chandeepa>	chisight not only the gettingstarted eg does that
<chandeepa>	my own sketch performs the same too
<chandeepa>	*performs the same
<chisight>	chandeepa, it's the lib.  it's never been reliable for me, the tmr20 fork worked but not reliably.
<chisight>	the hardware is great (at least my clones are)
<chandeepa>	i don't think chisight... the identical sketch worked really great...but now the identical sketch does not work
<chandeepa>	the sketch fails working since last night
<chandeepa>	not the lib fails
<chisight>	the only detail about the hardware is that it's apparently common for modules to not have enough decoupling on the power.
<chandeepa>	mean?
<chisight>	meaning you have to add more capacitance.
<chandeepa>	decoupling?
<chandeepa>	ah well
<chandeepa>	voltage regulator wont do?
<chandeepa>	but, they worked well before last night remember
<chisight>	.1uf across the power rails at the board.
<chandeepa>	but they worked well before last night remember(without the capacitors)
<chisight>	dunno chandeepa, i had the same issues with tmr20's lib.  worked one day, not the next.
<chandeepa>	and i want you to know that sometimes when i touch the 5v supply and gnd or any other pin., it heats up great
<chisight>	the regulator is heating up?
<chisight>	the power requirements on these is fairly minimal.
<chandeepa>	not the regulator, the module that fails tx and rx
<chandeepa>	other module works much fine even with gettingstarted ex
<chandeepa>	*eg
<chisight>	i haven't run into a heat issue here.  these are clones though.
<chandeepa>	i checked all the arduino pins, they works fine.... module must be burned or registers must not be working due to power issue
<chisight>	register 04 is 8bit read write.  i use that to test spi.
<chisight>	i have a separate routine for multibyte spi so i use tx_addr, register 10 for testing that.
<chisight>	that's 0x10.
<chandeepa>	yes but the spi works fine on arduino so it must be the module that fails
<chisight>	it's possible.  but you are using rf24 and so it could easily be that you're hitting some bug in that too.
<chandeepa>	if it does chisight why dont it begin at the testing period?
<chandeepa>	the error commenced last night only and it is still here
<chisight>	chandeepa, i don't know.  that lib is absurdly huge so i've not gone through the whole thing.
<chandeepa>	nope chisight, the library has been updated recently, few pros have commnented on the lib that bugs are off and i found many web sites revealing that rf24 works great now, i suppose that the error is with the module now
<chandeepa>	i think i'd better buying another and do the test...
<chisight>	if you want nrf24l01 code that is more readable, there is a download on the nordic website on the product page.  it's pretty easy to understand but isn't arduino compatible.
<chandeepa>	i did
<chandeepa>	but i dont want to continue reading
<chisight>	ok.
<chandeepa>	as there is not much conflicting issues with the lib i suppose
<chisight>	chandeepa, i had similar problems with that lib.  i was never able to resolve them.
<dan39>	howdy, been a while :|
<chandeepa>	chisight even the product page says it is not recommended -> http://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/products/2.4ghz-rf/nrf24l01
<chandeepa>	dan39 xbee or rf24+ for long range high speed comm?
<dan39>	no idea, sorry.
<chandeepa>	its ok dan39
<dan39>	but i would like to get into some rf things soon :)
<chisight>	chandeepa, my best recommendation is to use the module with different code.
<chisight>	chandeepa, your link is to the old version of the module.
<chandeepa>	chisight ah well..... well.. you won... i too use the same module remember
<chisight>	chandeepa, i thought you had the + version.
<chandeepa>	i have +
<chandeepa>	ah well
<chisight>	ok, good chandeepa.  that's the current one.
<chandeepa>	i visited the invalid link
<chisight>	the code i read is on the downloads tab on this page: http://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/products/2.4ghz-rf/nrf24l01-evaluation-kit
<chandeepa>	low power=low energy right?
<chandeepa>	if it has low enery, the frequency is high so, the penetration power is less so that's the reason it cannot move much without the antenna
<chandeepa>	*energy
<chisight>	chandeepa, you never mentioned long range before tonight.  you do know that the nrf24l01+ is only good for around 40 ft in high speed and at most 3x that at the lowest speeds.  right?
<chisight>	12ish meters
<chandeepa>	yes... but with the correct antenna soldered?
<chisight>	improved antennas would improve range, yes.
<chandeepa>	yes..do you know a method to solder?
<chisight>	no clue, sorry.  i use them at about 5 meters.
<chandeepa>	chisight here look at this ->http://yourduino.com/sunshop2/index.php?l=product_detail&p=190
<chisight>	indoors with 1 wall between.
<chandeepa>	that's why i told it has a higher frequency chisight
<chandeepa>	chisight ^^
<chisight>	chandeepa, that uses the same frequency but higher power, and of course allows an external antenna.
<chisight>	chandeepa, it's not legal in my country, so i can't really think about that.
<chandeepa>	yes...... that antenna specifies that it allows 1km
<chisight>	chandeepa, it does seem to say that, 1km at the lowest data rate.
<chandeepa>	yes... chisight let me know.... 2.4ghz is the frequency that mobile operators work right?
<chisight>	the 2.4ghz to 2.45 or so is reserved wide open limited power use here.  the module can be set to other bands too though, including frequencies illegal to use at any power in my country, and frequencies leased to sprint here.
<chisight>	the tmr20 libs default to a frequency that is illegal to use at any power level in my country.
<chandeepa>	chisight : well then better buying xbee for my requirement right"?
<chisight>	but tmr20 is canadian and probably operates by different laws.
<nashi>	chisight: so only use them when burnt in with different freq? if thats possible
<chisight>	chandeepa, i have no experience with zigbee products of any kind.
<chandeepa>	and chisight let me know how to use that tool you just sent me?
<chandeepa>	i mean that nordic sm
<nashi>	zigbee are way too expensive imo
<chandeepa>	*semiconductor
<chandeepa>	nashi yes they are expensive but long range with xbee right?
<chisight>	nashi, yes it is possible to set the frequency to values legal here, though the module chandeepa linked is too high power.
<dan39>	wondering about issue im having with thermistors. they were working fine before, but have oddly started to go bad. it is a 1k @ 25c thermistor. i have it wired as voltage divider. 5v to thermistor, then to a0 and 2.2k pad restistor
<dan39>	they are just reading incorrectly now. like instead of 80f, 120f
<chisight>	dan39, is that too much current for your thermistor?  it might be self heating due to current.
<chandeepa>	well
<dan39>	thats one thing i was wondering
<dan39>	and what is causing it to go back
<dan39>	bad*
<dan39>	i removed the one that was incorrect and got a spare
<chisight>	dan39, lemme look at the numbers...
<dan39>	put them both in same cup of water together and read resistance with multimeter, and it was pretty far difference
<dan39>	so i put the one i thought was good onto project and now its bad
<dan39>	the old one was reading correctly
<dan39>	shorting to ground maybe?
<timemage>	dan39, meaning 2.2k between a0 and gnd?
<dan39>	yes
<timemage>	dan39, and you have the internal pullup off, yeah?
<timemage>	dan39, probably enabling adc disables that anyway, but figured i'd ask.
<dan39>	hold on
<dan39>	i have so many version of the code, grrr
<chisight>	dan, checked power and you're around 1.6 miliamps @ 80f
<chisight>	sorry, miliwatts
<chisight>	dan39, oops, can't even use my own sheet.
<dan39>	i am not setting the pin high, so it shouldnt be turning on pullup, right?
<dan39>	i set a1 to input, then analogread
<chisight>	around 8 miliwats.
<dan39>	i can paste code if it helps
<dan39>	chisight: too much?
<dan39>	hold on i have spec sheet on the thermistor
<dan39>	this has become a real pain
<dan39>	i have an older version of project i believe still using the 2.2k pad and working
<dan39>	and it gets up to 140f
<chisight>	most should be able to handle at least 125 milliwatts and maybe 250 miliwatts so no problem.
<dan39>	hmm
<dan39>	but if it shorted to ground...
<dan39>	id think it would burn it out completely
<dan39>	but its still reading and adjusting, just incorreclty
<chandeepa>	chisight let me know how to use that rf24 tools you suggested me little earlier?
<dan39>	seems to raise with the temperature even, but starts at the wrong temp
<timemage>	dan39, show the code i guess.
<dan39>	im so confused as to wtf is happening
<dan39>	how these things just go bad
<dan39>	what would happen if thermistor shorts straight to ground?
<chisight>	chandeepa, the link i sent was to code to read to learn how to use the module without using a lib at all.  it's written for a different processor and isn't directly arduino compatible.
<timemage>	dan39, you would have to get its resistance pretty low for that to be a problem.
<chandeepa>	yes i know, but guide me how to use it?
<chisight>	chandeepa, that's really outside the scope of what i can do here.
<chandeepa>	chisight i got it
<chisight>	chandeepa, i can tell you that their routines, ported to arduino, worked for me.  they were the first code i got working.
<chisight>	dan39, did i miss the link?  could you send it again?
<dan39>	the code?
<chisight>	yes
<dan39>	im trying to find the lastest
<dan39>	latest
<chisight>	ok
<chisight>	dan39,  pastebin?
<dan39>	nah, im pasting it here, its only like a hundred lines
<dan39>	jk jk
<nashi>	from first looks no deep inspection it seems the clones i have of the arduino pro mini 5v work fine at 3v3 16mhz
<dan39>	http://sprunge.us/ocfx
<dan39>	thats my master piece right there fyi :p
<chisight>	:-) dan39
<honkhill>	alright, real noob here, been writing a code for a traffic light program and i'm stumped beyond belief. i just need a method that with a switch press it resets loop. http://pastebin.com/ysgzd6sn
<dan39>	and if anyone asks, you signed an nda ;)
<dan39>	jk
<chisight>	dan39, just me and you here.  nobody will know.  hehehe
<honkhill>	are there any active users that can help atm? using arduino uno btw
<dan39>	and something id really like to get done, a custom pcb. is there a service or person that we can pay to have a nice pcb design done?
<timemage>	dan39, what happens if you reduce numsamples ?
<dan39>	what do you mean?
<dan39>	it will average the readings over shorter #/time
<dan39>	hows the code? :p
<dan39>	i like to think im better at code than electronics
<timemage>	dan39, well, 50 is a fair amount. if you set it to 25 does it show any difference other than a larger jitter?
<chisight>	so far not seeing the problem.  still digging.
<dan39>	not sure
<dan39>	it shouldnt be a code problem
<dan39>	the code was working fine before
<dan39>	i havnt changed it
<timemage>	dan39, okay.
<dan39>	the thermistor itself is just reading incorrectly now, even with my multimeter
<timemage>	dan39, ah.
<dan39>	my code is outputting correct temperature based on the reading i get with multimeter and the chart for thermistor
<dan39>	but, the thermistor was reading much different until i wired it to my arduino.. :|
<dan39>	my other suspicion for this one is...
<dan39>	the soldering
<chisight>	ok, didn't check your thermistor equation because i don't have the specs on your thermistor anyway.
<dan39>	its like 8 inches of 22awg wire  from the thermistor
<dan39>	http://precisionsensors.meas-spec.com/rvt.asp?ptype=1003z
<dan39>	thats the thermistor im pretty sure
<chisight>	but i did check for writes to thermbpin (a0) and correct setup.  it's right.
<chisight>	also looked for other occurrences of a0 and found none.
<dan39>	could too much heat from soldering go down 8 inches of wire to damage the thermistor?
<timemage>	dan39, not sure what to tell you.  if you can get one end of the thermisator out of the circuit you could use your meter in resistance mode rather than checking the divider output.
<dan39>	i did
<chisight>	pinmode(thermpin, input); is right.  there is no digitalwrite() to that define or anything else defined a0.
<timemage>	dan39, and it's not behaving as expected there either?
<dan39>	nope, it seems to have been damaged some how
<chisight>	dan39, so far that does seem to be the explanation.
<timemage>	dan39, how long ago did you solder it?
<dan39>	2 days ago
<timemage>	dan39, heh, okay.
<dan39>	it seemed to break right after
<dan39>	maybe thats why now that i think
<chisight>	yep
<dan39>	but down 8+ inches of tiny ass wire
<dan39>	cmon
<chisight>	yeah, no way.
<dan39>	well thanks for the help
<timemage>	dan39, this is on a breadboard or just in air?
<chisight>	did it get wet?
<dan39>	im at a loss for explanations. going to order new thermistors and hope for the best
<dan39>	chisight: it is molded into a probe that goes into water
<chisight>	ahh.  so it leaks???
<dan39>	comes from manufacturer like that
<dan39>	i dont knwo
<dan39>	it shouldnt haha
<chisight>	try heating it in the oven at 200 for an hour.
<chisight>	see if it improves.
<dan39>	o_o
<chisight>	200f
<dan39>	why?
<timemage>	dan39, if it's reasonably pure water it might to make much difference.
<chisight>	to dry it out.
<dan39>	it is 100% pure water
<alvarop>	super noob question but connecting from the gnd (arduino) to the negative part on the left of the breadboard
<alvarop>	would make all the negative into gnd?
<timemage>	dan39, water by itself isn't terribly conductive.  add a little salt and, yes.
<alvarop>	am i understanding this correctly?
<dan39>	like literally near the purest shit you can filter to haha
<nashi>	dan39: almost no water is 100% pure
<dan39>	well we have it haha
<timemage>	dan39, what are you making?
<dan39>	not 100% of course
<dan39>	but dam near
<dan39>	timemage: electrolyzer and fuel cell systems
<nashi>	distilled water is the closest to 100% pure you can get
<chisight>	there's no way to filter salt, and there could have been something water soluble in the probe itself.
<nashi>	there is aa way to filter salt but its very expensive
<dan39>	nah this is much better than distillied
<dan39>	alvarop: yea sounds right
<dan39>	alvarop: that whole strip is connected
<nashi>	i meant most consumers, dan39 soorry
<chisight>	distilled is the only reasonable way to get rid of ions.  yeah, i was thinking that nashi, after i hit enter.
<nashi>	oki
<chandeepa>	chisight can you please tell me whether this module is fine for my 1km requirement and all other -> http://www.lankatronics.com/modules-and-sensors/rf/cc2500l-long-distance-wireless-module-pa-lna.html
<dan39>	ro + deionized
<nashi>	and no theres better ways chisight
<nashi>	yeah.
<nashi>	theres also nanofiltration but thats in its infancy right now
<alvarop>	right, thanks. and connecting the positive part of the led to one of the digital (pwm) pins would allow me to use those leds by calling them with the code, right?
<dan39>	and the output from the fuel cells is even better, its made by catalytic reaction of hydrogen + oxygen haha
<alvarop>	(just going through my thought process to find out where i made my mistake)
<dan39>	we call it the "god water"
<dan39>	it corrodes metal quickly, its weird
<nashi>	nanofiltration gives more pure results but takes forever and a day
<nashi>	and yes the most pure water is incredibly corrosive
<chisight>	chandeepa, i'm not seeing any information on range on that.
<dan39>	hmm
<chandeepa>	chisight - sensitivity: -110dbm@10kbps at 1500 meters
<chandeepa>	at the top of the features
<chandeepa>	chisight : and the applications : applications:  - wireless control - robot control - household automation - intelligent toys - game console - wireless sensor - wireless acoustic
<alvarop>	ugh wth, just reuploaded the code and now it works. ha...
<alvarop>	maybe something wasn't plugged in deep enough? :'(
<dan39>	im going to blame this on my bad soldering habits of using high heat and repeatedly touching a wire to fuss with it and stuff
<chisight>	chandeepa, that's only at the 10kbps setting.
<chisight>	there's nothing at any of the faster speeds.
<chandeepa>	well, it is enough to send a string object yah chishgt?
<chandeepa>	*chisight
<dan39>	grr
<dan39>	such a weird thermistor they picked. 1k @ 25c and beta that no others have
<chisight>	chandeepa, it says it can send that far slowly, yes.
<dan39>	is 10k @ 25c just as good for reading temps of around 0-200f?
<chandeepa>	chisight string objects default size pleaes?
<alvarop>	when i put a pushbutton on the breadboard, the part that isn't grounded is the one that goes to the digital pwd?
<chisight>	chandeepa, i don't use string objects, ever.  i use character arrays.
<alvarop>	or is i it the part that is grounded that goes to it? i'm confused
<chandeepa>	how did you come to know that it sends far slowly?
<chisight>	chandeepa, because the spec says 10kbps at 1500 meters
<cconstantine>	hello everyone :)  i just got a gemmav2, and neopixel ring (7 leds).  i’d like to use the fastled library to drive the leds, but all it does for me is turn them all on white.  the neopixel library works, so i know it’s wired up.  has anyone run into this and solved it?
<chandeepa>	yes but do you think that a string object exceeds 10kb?
<chandeepa>	chisight
<chisight>	chandeepa, i'm not sure how the two are connected.  since i don't use string objects, i really don't know their limits at all though.
<chisight>	10kbps is a speed, not a size.  if that's what you're asking about.
<dan39>	how do people program their code to read a thermistor using a lookup table? seems pretty tedious and only good for a certain range of temps..
<chandeepa>	nope chisight it can send 10kb per second and as string wont exceed that much it wont take a second to reach the receiver?
<chisight>	dan39, they're reasonably linear over small ranges so it's possible to build a table of slopes and interpolate between the points.
<dan39>	o i see
<chisight>	chandeepa, yes, that's correct.
<chandeepa>	yes
<chandeepa>	so why did you call it slow?
<chisight>	chandeepa, because we both have been using a module that runs at 2,000kbps.
<chandeepa>	ah its ok
<chandeepa>	but not 1km
<chandeepa>	lol
<chisight>	yes, not at 1km.
<chisight>	no clue what that amplified one could do for range, especially with a directional antenna.
<chandeepa>	i didn't get what you told ultimately chisight
<chisight>	chandeepa, that amplified module you linked that i said was illegal in my country might have the range.  look at the specs and see.  research the model and see what others say it really can do.
<dan39>	grrr
<dan39>	o god, you gusy recommend pastebing.com in topic!?
<chandeepa>	its in a shop in sri lanka so its legal
<chandeepa>	chisight
<dan39>	anyways, is there some good pages with common parts?
<dan39>	i find myself spending like hours searching for the popular solutions for random common things
<dan39>	like terminal blocks, connectors, n whatnot
<chisight>	dan39, unfortunately engineering tradeoffs are something we all spend tooo much time researching....  i can only recommend finding a blogger you like and that makes sense and using what they do.  or sticking with whatever sparkfun and the other higher end stores recommend.
<dan39>	i go to mouser etc. sometimes, there is just like 200 options for the same thing, its silly
<chisight>	chandeepa, great.  if it's legal there then it might be worth researching.
<chisight>	dan39, yeah.  it's a pain.  especially because the differences are often very obscure.
<chandeepa>	yes of course chisight i've another simple problem, the library github has, reveals info only on arduino uno, can you please check whether is it compatible with mega2560
<dan39>	like, i just want this... http://www.adafruit.com/products/372  but from amazon so i can get it like tomorrow.
<chisight>	chandeepa, which one?
<dan39>	and if i dont get it from amazon ill have to pay for it myself lol...
<dan39>	i have the boss's amazon login :p
<chandeepa>	http://www.lankatronics.com/modules-and-sensors/rf/cc2500l-long-distance-wireless-module-pa-lna.html
<chisight>	nice dan39.  so amazon it is.
<chandeepa>	chisight
<chisight>	chandeepa, not seeing a github link on that page.
<chisight>	there seem to be a variety of forks.
<dan39>	material : plastic, metal
<dan39>	sooo descriptive!
<chisight>	chandeepa, which one of the many cc2500 libs are you asking about?
<chandeepa>	https://github.com/yasiralijaved/arduino-cc2500-library
<chandeepa>	chisight
<chisight>	chandeepa, i'm not seeing where the pins are defined for the ss, so you might be stuck using the actual arduino ss pin for this and moving one of your other spi devices, but other than that i don't see anything not mega compatible.
<chandeepa>	you mean its compatible but there is no spi select? i suppose that it's a limitation of the lib, can you please find me a great lib?
<poppavic>	"a great lib"
<chisight>	chandeepa, it seems the slave select pin is hard coded to ss.  not sure how much work it would be to change.
<chandeepa>	its only an error with the library i think chisight?
<chisight>	chandeepa, not sure i'd call  it an error.  a  simplification maybe. one that might mean you have to adjust your hardware to match or adjust the library to meet your needs.
<poppavic>	the ss pin is just a digital high/low, right? any pin works.
<chisight>	poppavic, yes, on arduinos that is the case.
<chandeepa>	according to you there are other libraries too chisight? so there would be other libraries which rectifies that thing you;ve mentioned right?
<chandeepa>	adjusting the library
<chandeepa>	so changing the library
<poppavic>	chisight:  well, even elsewhere - i don't see an issue unless they built a unit in the chip that combines the only ss for that unit
<chisight>	some hardware spi is different as i learned...  the raspberry pi is different and you can't touch the ss pin yourself, the controller has to do it.
<chandeepa>	me nods
<chandeepa>	:d
<chandeepa>	chisight please find me another lib
<chisight>	the pi has several ss pins to choose from but unless you want to run really slow, you have to let the controller handle it.
<poppavic>	ahh
<chisight>	something to do with pipelining.   write caching.
<poppavic>	ugh
<chisight>	chandeepa, i have never heard of this module before tonight, i have no way to find or even do any significant evaluation of the various libs there seem to be.  nor do i have the reason to do that much work.
<chandeepa>	ok
<chandeepa>	chisight bye
<chisight>	that cc2500 module does actually look kinda nice.
<chisight>	haven't priced it though....
<poppavic>	well, find him a library that's moar betta
<chisight>	yes sir!
<chisight>	lol
<poppavic>	made me laugh is all.. sheesh
<chisight>	ebay search mostly hits for nrf24s at 10x the price.
<chisight>	poppavic, different country, different...  manners???  trying to be tolerant of differences.
<poppavic>	heh
<chisight>	tried to just have him use his existing nrfs on an alpha of my lib.  would be nice to have someone use it and provide some feedback before i do a bunch more work on it.
<poppavic>	<shrug> maybe he's on a production-code deadline.. i've laughed before
<chisight>	ahh.  i never noticed anything about production.  my lib is obviously not production code ready, it's alpha.
<chisight>	7 is the only one who's tried it and given feedback.  he made great suggestions and they've been implemented.
<poppavic>	this one looks cute - with sw on github: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10665?gclid=cjwkeajw7muqbrc2nnacqjmipt0sjabqxaoteh_sdpdeydulytuafezlp_idesbnrdxsm4nonkdmvbocwjnw_wcb
<poppavic>	http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?item=9sia35c1nb7694 is smaller and cheaper, but accessing pins looks iffy
<chisight>	kinda nice that it's complete, cpu and radio like the esps but the software is a setup.exe and an ,msi.
<chisight>	yeah $20 is a ton for 15 pins after the radio.
<poppavic>	well, i am disinclined to suffer anything requiring an .exe - java is bad enough
<chisight>	those silly half holes aren't too bad.  it's nice to have the mechanical connection of through hole but usually things don't need much strength an solder is enough.
<chillum>	the esp has made a lot of stuff seem overpriced
<chillum>	it is about time
<poppavic>	castellations, yeah. i see them more and more often.. makes some sense if the board size can be reduced even further
<chisight>	it's a bit hard for me to do anything requiring a .exe.  no ms windows.
<chillum>	thank you for the word "castellations", now i know what to google for
<chisight>	never knew that name.  if vibration or physical strength isn't an issue... not a big deal.
<chisight>	chillum, yeah.  it's nice.
<nashi>	chisight: if they are on both sides, thats a good bit stronger than on just one side in practice.
<chisight>	nashi, yeah if you're attaching to a pcb and not just soldering on wires.
<nashi>	thats what i mean. :)
<nashi>	chisight: why not wine then? dont need windows for exes
<chisight>	nashi, i'd rather not run things that don't have source.
<nashi>	just suggesting something to fix what seemed like an impasse to you
<chisight>	i make rare exceptions but for the most part i avoid it.
<chisight>	nashi, nah, i will just avoid their product.
<chisight>	i vote with my dollars and vote against closed source.
<chisight>	i have a stupid question for the c experts here.  i have some ugly many line code that uses #ifdef to deal with an unrolled loop of character assignments going into a string of variable length.
<chillum>	proprietary is something i try to avoid too. i like my hardware and software reasonably transparent
<dan39>	looks legit...? http://www.amazon.com/dp/b00sdt4tb6
<dan39>	ive literally been searching for like over an hour for such a simple dumb thing
<chisight>	i would like to make it less annoying by moving into a macro but can't seem to find a way to deal with entries that are sometimes defined and sometimes not.
<chillum>	i have a spool of nichrome, it resists pretty well
<chillum>	and is good for igniting model rocket engines
<dan39>	peace
<chisight>	dan39, clicked and see no issues.
<dan39>	how does adafruit not have a proper fucking datasheet for their's :|
<poppavic>	chisight:  not sure what you mean, and under the arduino ide your options are limited.
<dan39>	theirs... why do i always add extra ' to so many things :|
<chisight>	dan39, but i don't see a spec for waterproof.
<dan39>	chisight: what do you mean? that says it is waterproof?
<chisight>	poppavic, let me pastebin the fragment....  give me a sec to extract.
<poppavic>	recursive #includes are fun
<chisight>	dan39, not seeing waterproof.  thought you needed waterproof.
<dan39>	ill cover it with some silicon? lol
<chisight>	poppavic, http://paste.ubuntu.com/11125578
<chisight>	dan39, great.  looks ok otherwise.
<dan39>	dam, spec sheet says "not intended for fluid immersed applications"
<dan39>	cant win
<chisight>	3435k is your curve number
<poppavic>	that's fairly ugly, chisight - what's the goal now?
<chisight>	to make it not ugly poppavic
<poppavic>	ok, lemme pull up an editor and fiddle ;-)
<chisight>	address can be 3 to 5 bytes.
<chisight>	user uncomments the extra addressx if they want more than the default 3.
<dan39>	the one on adafruit looks exactly the same, tho it does say for in liquids
<dan39>	i bet it is the exact same one
<chisight>	oh, and poppavic it's called often, that's why it's unrolled.
<t4nk792>	hello, i am the guy that is working on a ups if anyone was here last time i was on
<poppavic>	ok
<t4nk792>	quick question, if i power the arduino off the battery as well, will that through off the aref as i monitor the battery voltage?
<chisight>	poppavic, thank you for taking a look.  been playing with http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26099745/test-if-preprocessor-symbol-is-defined-inside-macro
<chisight>	but they don't let you actually read the define that you test for existence.
<t4nk792>	chrisight, i have every finished btw, both on the duino and the windows client
<t4nk792>	including hybernation which was a bitch
<chisight>	great t4nk792!
<t4nk792>	well actually almost everything, i have to make a second program to check if the first is running and if not then start it
<t4nk792>	cause in order to get the hybernation to work i have to kill the serial app
<t4nk792>	but thats stupid easy
<chisight>	t4nk792, isn't the battery 12v?  if you run 12ish volts through a regulator for power and then use a divider to measure the actual voltage with an adc, the small change in the 12ish volts won't have an issue with the arduino being powered by a regulator on that same 12ish volts.
<t4nk792>	well the battery bank can be anywhere from 13.8-11v
<t4nk792>	with 11 being the cutt off i believe for the inverter
<chisight>	t4nk792, just use a lm317 set to around 8v to feed the onboard arduino regulator and it'll be fine.
<chisight>	assuming your arduino model has a regulator on board.
<chisight>	otherwise a 5v regulator and a nice big heat sink.
<t4nk792>	i will be using a uno probably
<t4nk792>	though i may use a micro for space
<chisight>	yeah, my knowledge of the models is limited...  i look at the schematic. :-\
<t4nk792>	that part is in the air
<t4nk792>	uno is the one with the swappable ic and the micro is the smallest useful one
<chisight>	t4nk792, i'm kinda partial to the nano.
<t4nk792>	does that come with hid compatibility?
<t4nk792>	like to use as a mouse ect
<chisight>	i like the usb plug for programming convenience and so that even non usb projects can use a cheap phone charger as power without any extra cutting.
<chisight>	t4nk792,  no, no hid support.
<t4nk792>	i think the micro has it
<chisight>	didn't realize that the micro had that.  but my model knowledge isn't much.
<t4nk792>	that or i just bought for s&g
<t4nk792>	i cant remember damn chinese 2 month long snail mail
<chisight>	yeah, such a pain.
<chisight>	that's  right, micro is the one that keeps showing up on ebay when you search nano.
<t4nk792>	i honestly cant even justify the savings of 10 bucks for that anymore
<chisight>	but isn't on the list on arduino.cc
<t4nk792>	it is towards the bottom
<chisight>	pro mini?
<t4nk792>	http://store.arduino.cc/product/a000053
<chisight>	ohh, that one.
<t4nk792>	yeah built in usb communication so i can support the hid class
<chisight>	atmega32u4 so yeah hid support.
<t4nk792>	i remember now
<t4nk792>	i was going to using to make a 16 key programable keypad
<t4nk792>	for macros and stuff
<chisight>	that the project or an element in something bigger?
<t4nk792>	thats it
<chisight>	cool.  simple. useful.
<t4nk792>	but once i master that then i would set my sights on a custom hotas
<chisight>	for your small plane????!
<t4nk792>	oh and the other project i have in mind for a micro is a password keeper
<t4nk792>	with a little lcd and buttons to toggle between jobs
<t4nk792>	cause we have to start using hashed passwords and fuck remembering that shit
<chisight>	so make a device to lose and...  lol
<chisight>	is that hotas for your plane?
<chisight>	or just a game controller?
<t4nk792>	no, its preparation for star citizen
<chisight>	ahh, a game.
<t4nk792>	http://www.mypilotstore.com/mypilotstore/sep/9814?gclid=cjwkeajw7muqbrc2nnacqjmipt0sjabqxaot3fakqz-29jyp86_fytrfwhw4lv_rkt8thinfih5krxocyhtw_wcb
<t4nk792>	im hoping for something like this but i will do it in all metal
<chisight>	fancy
<t4nk792>	yea but thats a ways away
<t4nk792>	i hate that radioshack closed
<t4nk792>	i cant find a lmanything
<chisight>	i really want a hand throttle for my car.  not sure i'm ready to do that with a chip though.
<t4nk792>	not for something like that i would stick to physical cables
<t4nk792>	or at least do what they do on planes
<t4nk792>	electrical as primary assist with the cables in place for electrical failure
<chisight>	the hybrid part is already controlled by a micro controller but there's only about 16 killowatts there.
<chisight>	throttle failure isn't a big deal.  it's a stick and the engine is governed.
<chisight>	but i'd hate to be stranded.
<t4nk792>	what if the sketch hangs at half throtle
<t4nk792>	the engine wont try to govern that
<chisight>	then you hit the clutch and turn off the engine.  the computer governs full throttle.
<chisight>	i know because my spouse is a terrible driver.
<t4nk792>	true
<chisight>	they regularly use the tires as a clutch. :-\
<t4nk792>	still use both, if soft crashes then disable it and use cable
<chisight>	probably.
<t4nk792>	i have a fun idea for a car
<chisight>	with a kill switch on the servo that forces it to no throttle.
<chisight>	what's that t4nk792?
<t4nk792>	cog stabilization using a gyroscope and weights on a four point horizontal axis that adjust to counter centripetal force and acceleration forces
<chisight>	also, the brake activates the servo's kill switch but self resets to allow throttle when the brake is released.
<t4nk792>	wait, is this a people car or a rc car?
<dan39>	$9 just seems too expensive
<dan39>	for 1 lil wire with a thermistor covered in plastic
<chisight>	t4nk792, sounds heavy.  1800lbs is nice, i don't want more.
<dan39>	nonsense
<chisight>	dan39, do you need it now?  what is that worth?
<t4nk792>	chris, you wouldnt need too much to counter
<chisight>	this is a people car.
<t4nk792>	you could probably get away with 4 100lb weights
<chisight>	t4nk792, ouch!  that's well over the total cargo capacity all by itself, not even including the driver.
<t4nk792>	well for a lighter car you can lighter obviously
<chisight>	i was thinking a few percent.  400lbs is almost 25%
<t4nk792>	actually i think it was something like 10% of gross weight
<t4nk792>	so 1800 for your car
<t4nk792>	180
<chisight>	yeah, still more than the total cargo.
<chisight>	after driver.
<t4nk792>	jeez, how much do you weigh?
<chisight>	my spouse would have to walk. :-(
<chisight>	i'm 6'3" and 205lbs
<chisight>	skinny.
<t4nk792>	also im thinking of a pplication for roll prone vehicles like trucks and such
<chisight>	yeah, not an issue with this car.
<t4nk792>	yea
<dan39>	i hate amazon for this stuff. no specs/datasheets. its horrible
<chisight>	the few i've heard of that rolled, the driver gets out, rights it and drives away.
<t4nk792>	probably with yours you could go really light just for better stabilation when hitting tight turns
<t4nk792>	and help hit the turns tighter
<t4nk792>	without spinning out the ass
<chisight>	60/40 balance helps make that almost a non problem.
<t4nk792>	cool
<t4nk792>	well in any case
<t4nk792>	its 3 am
<chisight>	there's a bit of oversteer but not bad.
<t4nk792>	thanks for the advice with the battery
<chisight>	yeah, it is late.
<chisight>	have a good night.
<chisight>	np
<t4nk792>	i will have to try finding a lm on something that no one will miss
<poppavic>	chisight:  try this: http://codepad.org/fggdj3hp
<chisight>	poppavic, thank you.  looking....
<t4nk792>	whats that for
<poppavic>	t4nk792:  just trying to clean up his code - i think he can now delete about 60% of it
<chisight>	poppavic, regwrite has to be monolithic because hardware handles the ss pin on the pi.  this is made for both pi and arduino.
<poppavic>	yeah, i understand - i just bolted together the macros from your messy ifdefs
<chisight>	looking harder....
<t4nk792>	oh, i may need your eraiser in the near future, going to touch the mp3 shield for the first time in the near future
<poppavic>	chisight:  every block closed in #if 0 is now defunct, if the new macros work.
<dan39>	done - 2 of yeeco 3m speed ntc r25℃=10k b25/50℃=3950k 10k thermistor temp temperature sensor waterproof temperature probe
<dan39>	bed time
<dan39>	dam its 3am
<poppavic>	nah, it's midnight
<dan39>	horrible waste of time that was
<t4nk792>	oh, anyone think its weird that if you set a computer to hybernate by toggling with a serial command that the computer will crash mid hibernation
<t4nk792>	only way i could get around it was to kill the program listening to the serial immediate after the hibernation command is called
<chisight>	poppavic, compiles and runs correctly  even if i still don't understand it.
<t4nk792>	magic
<nashi>	really cheap lcds with an spi connection and an sd card slot... are they usually only sd card file display lcds, or can you address the lcd directly per-pixel, or are they usually fully accessible lcd per-pixel and full sd card interfaces in one? i bought the first one ever with an sd card slot included, and im worried it's the first.
<chisight>	poppavic, i got it now.
<chisight>	some rearranging in there.
<chisight>	key change is the "notice i am extracting..." section.
<poppavic>	chisight:  it's just standard c use of cpp..
<poppavic>	just delete all the crap started with #if 0 (to the matching #endif )and yer gold.
<chisight>	yeah, found that.  also moved the macros to .h which was one thing i did want to work.
<poppavic>	cool
<chisight>	so, do #defines of macros apply on a 2nd pass?
<poppavic>	huh? cpp runs first, defines are collected and their content is used for text-replacement as it runs thru the file.
<poppavic>	after preprocessing, then the compiler gets the results to use
<chisight>	in order was my understanding.
<poppavic>	yeah
<poppavic>	and, of course, the arduino ide - and some others from the sound of it - add another stage before that, from what i hear/read
<chisight>	so if you #define foo(y) y=bar and then #define bar 3, then use int x; foo(x), you don't get 3 in x
<chisight>	yeah the ide has some sort of pre pre processor.
<chisight>	read about it but haven't run into more than trivial problems from it.
<chisight>	but in your code, foo is defined, then bar is defined and it seems to work.
<poppavic>	heh
<chisight>	address5 is assigned in the main .cpp file.
<poppavic>	ok, so?
<poppavic>	i never changed it
<chisight>	the #include is above that.
<chisight>	and #ifdef address3 ... is in the include.
<chisight>	before the address3 is defined.
<poppavic>	ok, and?
<chisight>	i thought the preprocessor was single pass.
<chisight>	apparently i was wrong.
<poppavic>	i didn't do a thing to your defines. i just worked within your framework
<chisight>	i know you didn't.
<chisight>	and the order is what i expect in yours.
<poppavic>	i don't understand the issue.
<chisight>	but then, without thinking i moved the macros out into the header.
<poppavic>	ok..?
<chisight>	that should have broken it.
<chisight>	it still works.
<poppavic>	never look a gift horse in the mouth, (just get some work out of him and start the bbq)
<chisight>	it was a mistake, i did what shouldn't have worked per my understanding, but it did work.
<poppavic>	heh
<poppavic>	is this under the arduino ide?
<chisight>	no, it's just g++
<poppavic>	ok
<chisight>	g++ -g -wall -fpic -ofast -mfpu=vfp -mfloat-abi=hard -march=armv6zk -mtune=arm1176jzf-s nrf24l01p.cpp -c
<chisight>	g++ -g -wall -fpic -ofast -mfpu=vfp -mfloat-abi=hard -march=armv6zk -mtune=arm1176jzf-s ptxgateway.cpp -lrt -lpthread ardupi.o nrf24l01p.o -o ptxgateway
<chisight>	that's the whole command line.  we're not touching ptxgateway though.  just nrf24l01p.cpp and nrf24l01p.h
<poppavic>	you could always add -m to it and see what the preprocessing looks like.
<chisight>	hmm, ok.
<poppavic>	i think it's just -m, but there are a series of those options (double check!)
<malinus>	you know guys, there is a reason for makefiles :d
<chisight>	it's in a makefile
<poppavic>	malinus:  damned right there is - stop reminding me
<chisight>	but pasting a makefile needs pastebin
<malinus>	if that is a line in a makefile, what's the damn point then :d
<poppavic>	codepad
<zap0>	makefile is a conspiracy to turn a simple thing into yet another mess of definitions
<chisight>	no, that's not the line.  http://paste.ubuntu.com/11126379
<poppavic>	makefiles in and of themselves are easy-peasy
<chisight>	zap0, its got a learning cuve.  useful after that.
<poppavic>	did you try the -m ?
<deshipu>	makefiles are great, until you get the brilliant idea of generating them
<zap0>	the fact they are written in some really screwed up syntax makes it just plain wrong.
<deshipu>	the format is not that bad either
<chisight>	sorry, distracted... i had but got a dump of what files were included rather than any expansion.
<poppavic>	autoshit to the rescue - automake autoproject autofacepalm
<deshipu>	die autotools
<chisight>	really, simple makefile is just as easy.
<poppavic>	chisight:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9041381/gcc-preprocessor-output-and-compilation-in-one-pass
<chisight>	-save-temps
<poppavic>	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4900870/can-gcc-output-c-code-after-preprocessing
<poppavic>	..and arduino 'kings' want to write yet another preprocessor - or worse, screw several of them together *sigh*
<chisight>	ahh, it is broken when i move it to the header.
<chisight>	i was using a 3 byte address, that works.
<poppavic>	well, then leave all the macros in the code you gave me, and just define your value stuff in the header, if you want
<chisight>	make it a 4 byte address and it still uses only 3 because the 4th byte is defined too late to be seen.
<chisight>	i had wanted the values in the main and the uglies in the header.  nobody reads a whole header.
<poppavic>	throw those two files to codepad, lemme look
<malinus>	zap0: so what do you use instead of makefiles?
<zap0>	i use makefile.
<zap0>	sometimes makefile are overkill, and a simple shell scripts is suffiecient.
<deshipu>	um, makefiles are simple shell scripts...
<malinus>	~*mindblown*~
<malinus>	:d
<tawr>	lol
<tabaliah>	good morning zap0
<zap0>	it's evening, you timist!
<deshipu>	igt
<tabaliah>	:)  i was just on my way to bed.
<deshipu>	tabaliah: you mean coffin?
<tabaliah>	something like that - g'night zap0 :)
<zap0>	by-e!
<macscr>	i know very little about arduinos. i do know that i dont need a full pi though and an arduino seems about perfect for my need. i have an ubuntu server that i would like to be able control 433mhz lights in my house. seems most of the arduino projects that perform such a task involve running a web server on the arduino itself. can i simply connect an arduino to a pc and communicate to it through usb
<macscr>	 to send singals through an 433mhz transmitter?
<zap0>	yes
<zap0>	setting up serial in an arduino is a 1 line of code task.
<macscr>	zap0: cool. i thought so. i figured that was a better way to go and gives me more flexibility and options to expand versus simply buying a usb 433 transmitter
<zap0>	most arduino boards come with a led, so you can see traffic flow (very useful).  and there are a bunch of io for any other trivial thing you want to add
<tawr>	macscr, it all depends what you want to do. you could have the arduino plugged into your computer, acting as a usb-wireless bridge for the 433mhz lights. or you could use a pi, which replaces your computer, and runs it's own webserver. you can even have a pi doing that, which then runs the arduino! haha
<macscr>	tawr: well the server is my media/file server, so thats not going away and it already runs 24/7
<macscr>	and is already in a great central location of the house, so figured it would be a good place to control the lights
<macscr>	does a n arduino always require external power or can it also simply be powered through usb from the pc?
<poppavic>	i use these new things called 'switches'
<macscr>	poppavic: im not sure what you are trying to be a smart ass about =p
<poppavic>	i know
<tawr>	usb macscr
<tawr>	plug it into your computer, you power it and control i and program it..
<macscr>	last noob question for the night: should i simply by a uno r3 rev3 dev board (comes with usb cable) for about $12? thats the arduino board itself and not just a board to work with one, right? lol. sorry, i am trying to do some research first before asking such questions
<poppavic>	it's usb driven: handy
<poppavic>	it or the mega2560 are nice
<tawr>	macscr, yes. that would be a clone
<tawr>	because they're open source.
<tawr>	but, if you're using something for home automation, i suggest an alternative
<tawr>	the ruggeduino, especially if you're 'new' to electronics
<macscr>	i guess the specific one im looking at is the ieik uno r3 board atmega328p
<tawr>	it's an arduino uno that is upgraded to ridiculous levels. you simply cannot kill them
<tawr>	while you can easily kill an arduino board
<poppavic>	the r3 2012 dip board is handier than the smt, i think
<tawr>	macscr, i bought the ruggeduino (even though i have 2 uno's floating around) because i started teaching my nephews electronics
<tawr>	it's my favorite board now.. and i have 3 uno's, 2 bbb's running as servers, an rpi2, arduino micro, arduino mega..
<poppavic>	tawr:  rugged discontinued
<tawr>	no
<tawr>	http://www.ruggedcircuits.com/microcontroller-boards/
<tawr>	the ruggeduino (base) was discontinued, they now have even further upgraded ones
<poppavic>	http://www.ruggedcircuits.com/microcontroller-boards/ruggeduino ahhh
<tawr>	i've had mine a few years now
<tawr>	thank you for bringing it up, because i'm definitely picking up their new special edition!
<tawr>	even has a dc-dc boost supply on it now! damn.. want.
<chisight>	poppavic, this radio is designed to be a hub and spoke system.  central transceiver with the other transceivers on the spokes.  does it make sense to call the radios/devices on the spokes "peers"?
<tawr>	macscr, https://andrew-sterian.squarespace.com/10-ways-to-destroy-an-arduino
<poppavic>	sure
<chisight>	ok, thanks.
<chisight>	just trying to come up with terminology for the model.
<poppavic>	peers, clients, children
<chisight>	hmm, maybe client is better.  the hub polls them because these things aren't full duplex.
<poppavic>	yei, even slaves
<chisight>	kinda like that too.
<chisight>	ok, sleeping on it.  thanks again for the help poppavic.
<poppavic>	np
<hanrun>	guys is anybody here good with the ethernet shield ?
<zap0>	i hear they are fragile, and lock up often.
<hanrun>	what do you mean lock up ?
<azv4>	like something gets bugged and it stops working
<bigx>	flea86, https://vimeo.com/127465005
<bigx>	hello there
<bigx>	i was wondering if arduino micro is compatible with the standard firmata?
<tawr>	it is
<bigx>	trying to search on the interwebz with no luck
<tawr>	why do you think it will not work?
<bigx>	tawr, not all boards are compatible
<tawr>	that's new to me, maybe not the yun or what ever
<tawr>	but basic boards are
<tawr>	i've run it on mega, uno, ruggeduino, clones, and micro
<bigx>	afaik last time i checked it was not compatible with the micro
<bigx>	right now, for an installation i need to order 5 arduino and the micro seems the form factor i need, but i also need firmata
<pwillard>	nano *would* work... micro is like a leonardo in nano form factor
<superbia>	howdy
<superbia>	what is the minimum $ i need to spend to make a small 3d scanner and printer (for printing teeth retainers)
<superbia>	aka plastic piece you put on your teeths, to keep them in place
<tawr>	lots
<tawr>	precision costs more than size
<superbia>	hmz
<superbia>	its essentially a cnc tawr
<superbia>	plus the "special head"
<tawr>	i'm aware. except cnc usually has actual positioning
<tawr>	while 3d printers use steppers and hope it doesn't slip
<tawr>	hence, precision costs money
<superbia>	hmz.. cnc also uses steppers
<tawr>	you mean home made cnc stuff? because real cnc machines do not use steppers
<tawr>	they use brushless servos and realtime feedback positioning systems
<azv4>	can be either
<tawr>	maybe little cnc conversion kits
<tawr>	but i have never seen an actual cnc machine use steppers
<tawr>	except maybe for the the collet changer or something
<azv4>	you've seen every cnc machine in the world?
<tawr>	but that's all _big_ stuff
<tawr>	no, but i've worked on or with as a machinist, azv4
<tawr>	but i can tell you, you're not going to find a stepper and an engineer that hopes it won't slip or skip steps in a 5 million dollar cnc machine, nor will you find it in a 250k one
<tawr>	will you find it on $500 dollar harbor freight benchtop mill cnc conversions? sure you will
<azv4>	see them in table top mills designed to cut wood
<tawr>	cnc routers? yeah
<tawr>	they also usually have 1/16-1/8" resolution
<azv4>	yea, cnc machine
<azv4>	naw, little better than that i think
<azv4>	at least the one i was looking at
<tawr>	belt drive doesn't let it be that much more accurate without encoders
<tawr>	which is what i was saying.. that pure stepper isn't that accurate
<superbia>	aha.. so encoders give you exact positioning
<superbia>	now to discover how to actually interfact *cad and the printer
<tawr>	yes superbia
<tawr>	steppers can slip
<tawr>	or miss steps
<tawr>	and lose torque when you micro-step to get better resolution
<tawr>	going encoder fixes some of those problems
<tawr>	you can somewhat get around them by gearing the steppers very low
<tawr>	so that you print slower even at max speed, but get some of that back in precision
<superbia>	tawr: ye all clear..
<tawr>	that being said
<superbia>	is there some way/library to interface software with hardware
<tawr>	if you're in the us
<tawr>	im pretty sure that it's considered a medical appliance and is goverened by the fda
<tawr>	so trying to make them is illegal
<superbia>	then you friend live in a non-democratic country
<tawr>	i live in a country that has people injecting fix-a-flat into people's asses in their apartments
<tawr>	you want oversite like that.
<tawr>	otherwise you have guys making dental appliances out of fix a flat or unknown plastics that could be leaching lead for all you know
<azv4>	you just gave me an idea, arduino controlled tattoo gun
<pwillard>	been done
<tawr>	which is why the fda watches over medical stuff. unless next time you go to the hospital you have some unknown piece of plastic tubing shoved up your urethera that was last handled by a ukranian in his bathroom
<azv4>	pwillard, link
<tawr>	or, you know, medical grade with certifications that's been sterilized via radiation
<superbia>	if ukranian wants to make for himself
<pwillard>	http://arduinoarts.com/2014/04/1369/
<superbia>	also illegal
<kline>	theres a guy who demo'd a laser tattoo system
<kline>	just stick your arm under a laser cutter and it blasts burns onto you
<kline>	apparently the smell was worse than the pain
<tawr>	yeah
<tawr>	thehacksmith
<pwillard>	i recal seeing another one that was way cooler...almost steampunk
<tawr>	he let his dumbass friend who wants to be on jackass do his youtube channel logo
<tawr>	kline, i've done it by accident a few times, it smells the same as exposed skin from welding
<kline>	http://hackaday.com/2008/07/05/laser-tattoo/
<sbl>	hello. i tried burn bootloader in atmega 328p-pu via arduino uno (arduino as isp) but after upload arduinoisp scetch to arduinouno and next (change programmer to arduino as isp) > burn bootloader i see only "programmer is not responding"
<sbl>	connections in my breadboard with atmega328 is correct
<sbl>	i was pullup sck,miso,mosi from arduno to atmega pins, reset i was pullup via 10k ohm resistor to arduino (pin10)
<sbl>	i was putting quarz 16mhz with two 22pf capacitors to atmega pins 9 and 10
<sbl>	what is wrong?
<sbl>	i tried with 3 indepdents arduino uno.. always the same error
<pwillard>	<sigh> this is why i never recommend arduino as isp.
<sbl>	pwillard: why? (sorry i was lost connection internet)
<sbl>	i ordered avr usbasp programmer, but in wait time i had think to try arduino as isp but doesn't work as expected
<pwillard>	many many people have problems with it.  it is a kludge that usually only works if 1) you found correct instructions  2) have wasted your lottery winning luck on firmware uploading  (should have bought a ticket)
<sbl>	pwillard: i have branded arduino uno (from arduino.org and ide is from arduino.org)
<sbl>	connections are correct in my opinion, there is nothing difficult
<pwillard>	maybe someone else will be able to help...
<jottr>	hi all. i am trying to set up the ino command line tool. when using external libraries, can i simply copy them to the ./lib directory of my ino project?
<azv4>	led grid, have resistors only on my columns, should i put them on the lead in to the columns and the rows?
<pwillard>	they only need to be on one side  not both columns and rows
<azv4>	that is what i've read a few times, i guess i'm just not sure i understand why
<azv4>	is it because the led's are diodes, and any time i set a pin high that is connected to the cathode end of the leds, the power isn't going to make it past the 1st led anyways?
<pwillard>	basically. they will only *light* when the right combination of row and column are active... so you just need 1 resistor for the active node segments that contain resistor and led.
<azv4>	must google "active node segment"
<pwillard>	well, for every row, you are only activating 1 column at a time...
<azv4>	i figured out how to light individual leds finally, i can't say that im sure i understand how it works on the electrical level though
<pwillard>	the resistors are shared between coumns
<bigx>	hi pwillard, yeah at least the standard firmata seems to compile when i select the arduino micro board, so it should be ok
<jottr>	hm. since the ino commandline tool seems to be dead, are there any alternatives out there?
<bigx>	jottr, leo
<bigx>	https://github.com/adammagaluk/leo
<jottr>	bigx: that seems to be a very young project though
<jottr>	something seems to be going on at the arduino repo: https://github.com/arduino/arduino/blob/master/build/shared/manpage.adoc
<t4nk194>	hi
<pwillard>	an led is just a diode pn junction with impurities that cause illumination.  the diode is essentially a "wire" after the forward voltage is reached so it need to have a resistor to limit the current in the wire to an acceptable value for the led to not self destruct.
<bigx>	jottr, yes yes but i really like the idea of using npm to manage arduino libs at the project scope
<t4nk194>	has anyone got an experience using rrdtool and an arduino with updating the database?
<azv4>	pwillard, i understand that part, i was just surprised i had to set some of my cathode side to high to light individual leds
<bigx>	jottr, it makes your project easier to distribute and also ease the collaboration
<t4nk194>	i'm having no luck, and can't get the supposed php library to work at all.
<azv4>	and the concept of multiplexing to light multiple single leds at the same time surprised me too
<pwillard>	tried it t4nk194, gave up when i had trouble getting rrdtool to work on my pi and just went for mysql and javascript d3 based graphs
<jottr>	bigx: probably. what i am looking for is either a stable project or something from the arduino maintainers.
<t4nk194>	:/ i got mysql to work, maybe i should just go with that
<t4nk194>	all i want is wireless sensors set up to post data to the pi with the database
<pwillard>	i'm mainly saying i figured out how not to do it.
<pwillard>	maybe there have been some improvements... i've not tried it since last summer
<jottr>	bigx: there seems to be http://platformio.org/#!/
<t4nk194>	you have any examples on how you set yours up pwillard?
<bigx>	jottr, yes another option, but python based, and i prefer wayyy more node.js to python
<bigx>	t4nk194, it should be easy to setup a rest api where you can post data from your arduino and a 3rd party lib that will bridge this rest api to rrdtool
<bigx>	https://github.com/orion98mc/node_rrd is an example
<mun>	hi
<mun>	i've just got myself an accelerometer like this one
<mun>	http://www.aliexpress.com/item/free-shipping-adxl345-3-axis-digital-acceleration-of-gravity-tilt-module-for-arduino/1825481028.html
<mun>	but, somehow only the y axis seems to work. x axis doesn't move much. z axis doesn't move at all
<mun>	could i be doing something wrong?>
<munt>	has anyone ever used an old android phone as a linux webserver ?
<t4nk194>	bigx: i feel overwhelmed looking at that link :d i've never really done web development or backend stuff
<munt>	… had the idea there now, but upon a google search im not the first ;) … looks like a good iddea.  my old phone is a beast
<bigx>	t4nk194, ah, then you may find a ready to use solution, maybe there is some?
<t4nk194>	really wanted to learn while doing, so that's why i'm avoiding ready made data trackers
<t4nk194>	wanna make a panel myself with all the data
<t4nk194>	just having a lot of trouble with this rrdtool php library
<munt>	t4ank194 are you trying to set up a webserver with your arduino as the data inputter ?
<t4nk194>	noo, i have a rpi running the backend stuff
<t4nk194>	i want to send data to it and have it make the charts databases and stuff
<t4nk194>	i did manage to set up a mysql logging script
<munt>	nice, i want to do that someday.  i just finished setting up my first headless linux server with a persistent vpn and dns updater (very easy, just not when you dont know how)
<munt>	what are you having problems with ?
<t4nk194>	rrdtool database updating
<t4nk194>	with data that is sent from an outside source
<t4nk194>	preferably with a php script, but at the moment i'm having absolutely no luck with that
<chillum>	rrd is a great tool
<chandeepa>	anyone familiar with cc2500 module(transceiver)?
<t4nk194>	chillum: would be nice if i could get it to work :)
<munt>	t4nk194:  i only just had a quick look … but are you having problems creating a timestamped updating file in linux ?
<chillum>	what is not working?
<t4nk194>	saywha
<t4nk194>	i'm trying to update my rrdtool database with a php script
<chillum>	you could make a munin plugin that checks a file that your php updates, thus removing the rrdtool interface infrastructure
<chillum>	i use munin anyways so it was the easiest way for me
<chillum>	but i have worked directly with rrdtool before, it is a little awkward but doable
<t4nk194>	rrdtools seems pretty easy to use, but interfacing with it is painful
<munt>	is it not a case of making a program/script that outputs // rrdtool update temperature_data.rrd n:value
<nik05>	hello, apperently someone gave me a small arduino. but what can i do with it?
<munt>	nik05: first see if they actually gave you it, goodstart.
<pwillard>	nik05, hundreds of uses... honestly
<t4nk194>	nik05: whatever you can think of
<pwillard>	well, not *whatever*
<t4nk194>	pwillard: you can get pretty far
<t4nk194>	but yeah, not really whatever
<nik05>	well it doesnt say arduino on it, but he said it was an arduino
<chandeepa>	pwillard i want a help with cc2500 rxtx module
<nik05>	how do i know if its an arduino and which type it is?
<chillum>	nik05: build a flashing led
<chillum>	do a google image search for "arduino nano" "arduino mini" "arduino uno" etc, and see which one looks like yours
<munt>	nik05: your imagination is the limit.  fpor me as a beginner i enjoyed these videos https://youtu.be/fcxza9_kg6s?list=pla567ce235d39fa84
<t4nk194>	nik05: take a photo of it and post it
<chillum>	there are clones by other companies but they look similar and work fine(mostly)
<nik05>	ah it looks like the arduino nano
<munt>	nice
<chillum>	i have an atmega328, a 16mhz crystal but i have no capacitors right now, i assume that is not enough
<chillum>	the nano is a nice one
<munt>	i (perhaps wrongly) just look at arduino as an easy way to program computer chips that in addidtion to running programs can create physical events.  they come in 1000’s of form factors
<nik05>	but the image on google has "arduino nano" on it, this one not...
<chillum>	an arduino nano is essentially a tool to make using the atmega328 chip on it easier to prototype with
<nik05>	is it a remake, maybe?
<chillum>	likely a clone
<chillum>	it is open source so anyone can make them
<nik05>	oh oke
<t4nk194>	chillum: whats your rrdtool setup? like how do you post data to it
<chillum>	i will pm you in a short while about that, have to find it
<munt>	t4nk194: where is your data coming from ?
<t4nk194>	an arduino esp whatever that connects to the internet really..
<t4nk194>	thats why i want a php update script :d
<nik05>	this one hasthe mega328p chip
<chandeepa>	t4nk194 do you have any knowledge on cc2500 rxtc module?
<nik05>	oke thank you, i will take a look
<t4nk194>	chandeepa: no, sorry
<chandeepa>	its ok t4nk194
<munt>	t4nk194: could you not call a bash script from the php page your posting to (sounds dirty, but might work)
<munt>	i just made my firt bash script today … so everything must be done with them :d
<nik05>	maybe i can now also do things with my raspberry pi, it also has those pins :p
<munt>	an arduino is a great companion to a pi
<munt>	you can use it via serial usb or via the io pins
<chandeepa>	can anyone please look at this link -> http://www.lankatronics.com/cc2500l-long-distance-wireless-module-pa-lna.html and tell me whether it supports uart... its cc2500l module (rxtx) please im urgent
<nik05>	oke cool
<chandeepa>	nik05 are you going to have a look at it?
<nik05>	oh uh no?
<chandeepa>	nik05 this link says that it supports uart but other links does not mention about uart but spi
<chillum>	spi is different
<chillum>	but usable with a lot of mcus that have uart
<leonerd>	hi all.. does anyone have/know of a pinout diagram for the micro pro (the 32u4 board), that actually shows the real avr pin names on it? i can't seem to find one
<leonerd>	i bought this board because £6 for a 32u4 is good... but it seems the price i'm now paying for that, is that i can't actually work out what the io pins actually are
<nik05>	can i use arduino 1.0.5 or 1.5.6.2 or should i get the new one from arduino.cc?
<deshipu>	leonerd: there is a schematic on the sparkfun page
<leonerd>	deshipu: http://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/dev/arduino/boards/pro-micro-v11-5v_b.pdf
<chandeepa>	chillum yes but that link says it is uart
<chandeepa>	deshipu are you here?
<leonerd>	yes; i may just have to use that and annotate my own diagram :(
<chillum>	then they are lying or it supports uart
<chillum>	have you read the datasheet?
<deshipu>	chandeepa: no, i'm not here, unfortunately, i'm womewhere else
<deshipu>	somewhere*
<jottr>	ok so there should be an official commandline tool since 1.5.~, but i can't find the arduino binary on 1.6.4 on osx. does anyone know if this actually exists or not? https://github.com/arduino/arduino/blob/ide-1.5.x/build/shared/manpage.adoc
<chandeepa>	deshipu lol..can you help me
<deshipu>	leonerd: that doesn't help?
<chandeepa>	deshipu please look at this link -> http://www.lankatronics.com/cc2500l-long-distance-wireless-module-pa-lna.html and tell me whether it supports uart... its cc2500l module (rxtx) please im urgent
<leonerd>	deshipu: i guess it does; in a roundabout way. it just means i'll have to print the diagram out then write in the pin names myself...
<leonerd>	deshipu: i was hoping for one of the standard diagrams that most of the other boards have, where that information is included
<deshipu>	leonerd: heven't seen such, sorry
<pwillard>	nik05, nothing wrong with 1.64
<deshipu>	chandeepa: no idea
<chandeepa>	deshipu ohhhhhh
<nik05>	pwillard but its not in debian yet
<pwillard>	i', just saying that the latest available should work fine
<chandeepa>	pwillard you helped me yesterday right?
<nik05>	oke
<pwillard>	nik05, some new features have arrived and they are nice  but there are some specific reasons to run old versions... but not ones you will likely have...
<nik05>	but i can just use 1.5, its not that there are some major problems with older versions?
<kline>	nik05: dont use the debian repos for arduino
<kline>	theyre always out of date, regularly broken, and arduino is even simpler to deploy than the usual ./configure make make install dance
<kline>	(its literally just unpacking a zip)
<nik05>	oke, thank you
<chillum>	the new ide is much better than the old version
<pwillard>	true
<nik05>	the website doesnt work, i click on linux 64bit and then it goes to a donate page, which lets me download the windows setup
<chandeepa>	what is asynchronus serial operation
<kline>	nik05: interesting, gimme a sec
<nik05>	oke it works now, tried it a few times again
<pwillard>	asynch serial data has no clock... sometimes referred to as rs232 for convenience.   spi, on the otherhand is synchronous
<pwillard>	no clock means you have to agree to a speed at each end... like 9600
.or recover the clock from the signal ("autobaud")
