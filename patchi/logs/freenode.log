*	- studies in Chicago to serve in the Army in Europe during
*	- WWII, then returned to school and work in Chicago until he
*	- began writing full-time in 1951.  The author of The Marching
*	- Morons and the novels The Space Merchants (with Frederik
*	- Pohl) and The Syndic, he's best known for his biting social
*	- satire and his collaborations with Pohl and with Judith
*	- Merril.

Bad news is that version 5.x will not receive any new developement, only bug fixes, so, no ipv6 (for example)
