hi guys, i have a javascript file with content really compressed. all is in one line without spaces, how can i make the file more readable? thanks	http//jsbeautifier.org/
: but why do you want that?	dynamic react page. everything is determined from json. so each component may have sub-components(again dynamic) and so on. so the higher ups asked if it was possible to convert all the `.map` functions into their corresponding output before serving to the user. less functions more performant.. i guess thats what they were ultimately going for

: so i'm getting an assertion error in mocha... but i can't seem to find what the difference b/w the two (output and expected) is. how would i debug the same?	if it's something like 1 vs 1 then you could debug their types as '1' !== 1

ycle: yeah if he neas to store some data that doens´t need to be searched or sorted by, he can json it and put it in one column right ?	then you have to encode "kind" information in code.  code may bloat to some unknown degree.
how does someone actually become a friend though? wouldn't you have to technically befriend a strange?	yes
"this parent chain is defined by a hidden slot in every object, called [⁣[prototype]⁣]. you can't change this slot directly4, so the only way of setting it is when you're creating a fresh object.
