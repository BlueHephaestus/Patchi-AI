i have an odd question. i learnt the term “real programmer” today. i googled “programming syndrome” looking for any articles on being addicted to coding. i thought maybe it’s my aspergers and this is my special interest. but i hit an article that rang true. i literally spend 80% to 90% of my waking hours programming, or reading books. anyone here had similar issues?	hey  - talk to codeotaku when he comes back he has that issue

so then, if i don't know what exception type could be raised, i should just use a bare "except:" right?	a base except (without re-raising) is *always* (well 99.9% of the cases) the wrong thing - you'd usually find out what exceptions can be caused (by testing or reading the docs) and handle only those you actually know how to handle - because of what  just said

if i zero out a previously-encrypted partition, will that notify the drive that it is not being used so that it can overprovision?	there's some tool to trim an entire partition away iirc
why would i _have_ to trim anything? what does that exactly mean/do?	you install alsa-utils unmute the channels with alsamixer
as in replace() ?	 yeah but i am trying to do a regex replace

: where do you run xrandr? in a tty?	yes
3x nested dicts?	you could.  but i think a more direct mapping of your data would probably be easier too work with.  you have a bunch of firewalls make them a list or set.  each firewall has a bunch of configs.  make that a list or set.  the configs have name->value properties so make that a dict
