i believe it is in the nano. the reason i've chosen the nano (but haven't ordered it yet) is i'm very size constrained. the sensor i'm reading produces data at a fairly low data rate, about 1hz, could i use a software serial library emulate a uart?	there's softwareserial and altsoftserial which can emulate a uart. they have some limitions (needing full cpu attention disabling interrupts etc depending on the flavor)

i mean, i guess if you had undefined behavior in a write operation, that could cause problems, but shouldn't the os protect the fesystem from that?	the comper is allowed to do *anything*
: but why do you want that?	dynamic react page. everything is determined from json. so each component may have sub-components(again dynamic) and so on. so the higher ups asked if it was possible to convert all the `.map` functions into their corresponding output before serving to the user. less functions more performant.. i guess thats what they were ultimately going for

ddd?	 domain driven design
: you'll go back through and re-test every code path through every single project whenever there's a new version of flask?	yes i'm referring to documentation. but to me both square and curly brackets were confusing and a more simple "x out=none" would be more understanble (i think the same is true for other people as well). numpy uses a lot of square brackets and numpy is usually used in combination with scipy. e.g. most ufuncs in numpy have square bracket notation like http//docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.add.html#nump

: had you been following the conversation? was using that as a contrastive example to demonstrate his views on telegraph academy's admission policies, not actually proposing to start such a school. as far as i'm aware, talking ~about~ racism isn't agains the rules.	 oh on top of that telegraph's website seems to make very little indication that it favors minorities; "the 12-week software engineering accelerator for people of color." appears to just be marketing!

soo many power saving options. what should i use? any recommendations? do i really have to wade through individual options?	 no but that's because common ethics would suggest it is wrong.  common ethics do not currently have any effect on computer usage.  if everyone had best practices for the aur as common knowledge before using yaourt i'm sure you would see much less people ing the pkgbuild when given that option.  but these practices are *not* common knowledge and thus users do not know better.

what if ?var=false?	  why use false when null already means null?
 can you please tell me why that even when the module does not exist in arduino pins, it is notified as it exists? (note : after serial reconnection it is fine)	hmm anyway thanks

, so, i was looking at a set of slides, where they were comparing the time taken for iteration over 3d arrays in row-major order. the best order would be (i,j,k) where k varies fastest, because of cache locality. but experimentally, results are shown that (j,i,k) is faster. what could be the possible reason?	the problem is the windows seems very windows specific since its my current os
