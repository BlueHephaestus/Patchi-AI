has anyone here ever read dijkstra's "a discipline of programming"? i'm really enjoying his explanation of his guarded command language. it's particularly cute how he motivates "skip" and "abort" (sequencing's unit and zero, respectively) without requiring the reader to know any abstract algebra.	i've finally ruined nano! behold lisp plugins! http//imgur.com/hqpay3y
