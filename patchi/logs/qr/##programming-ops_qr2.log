: ok, so passing in the arg like that works. but how do i make it wait 1 second before logging each thing?	because you're calling all 4 logsomethings immediately.

uh because wouldn't that defeat the purpose of a chimney?	-10f? whats that in human language? -50c?
: yes, since 5.4. short tags are enabled by default but if they are not enabled your code will fail on <?=	the safe way to do it is <? echo

hi, i have an object that has a method like this, $object->geatever(), but that method is not present in the object's class, nor in its parent classes. what should i look for, to find its origin? thanks	look for magic methods i guess
debugging code?	"this parent chain is defined by a hidden slot in every object called [⁣[prototype]⁣]. you can't change this slot directly4 so the only way of setting it is when you're creating a fresh object. " hmm  in that link you sent they say this but isn't the [[prototype]] object just located at obj.prototype? the way i do inheritance now is just by setting obj.prototype to a new instance of the super class...
(sp?)	it's spelled affluence...
: a) have you got that class? b) do you use autoloader?	 yes i see the class in its vendor dir and i do require the autoloader in the index.
screwsss are you mad because im not indonesian or because my bot is ??	what can i say some like it hot
: as far i see smb is not in supported scheme right?	my point exactly
if you always expect $id to be defined (even if it is defined with null), then do $id = isset($_get['id'])? $_get['id']: null;	 that's isset() not $isset()
using a framework?	literphor could be that you're attempting to store a closure in sessions...
: if you weren't using an orm, would you consider an ar pattern?	already covered that
mind if i pastebin?	got it wrong image type output.
https://blog.martinfjordvald.com/2010/09/12000-requests-per-second-with-nginx--and-memcached/ <-- is this for real or in his wet dreams?	 that said if you're in that type of situation you might be doing something kinda weird/wrong

: you're telling me that if i do preg_match ( "..." , $_get [ 'username' ]), it is going to examine the url-encoded version of username?	..wat?
: what do you mean with proper dsn? i have a conf.class where the connection data is stored in	 you also want to set errmode_exception
who could possible take my arguments and interest in a topic seriously if i don't articulate my sentences with perfect grammatical affluence?	bothering to learn and implement proper spelling and grammar makes those that make such a decision better than those that don't in my hardly-humble opinion
what does the script do?	it run only one query with specific id and if found row header("locationurl");
 : 50 rows in your database ? that's... a lot ? :p$	50? no... 3 million yeah
as opposed to my stuff?	 yeah.
, wtf?	because youa sk too many stupid questions.

if you must loop over them, perhaps they ought to be a single arg. an array?	 maybe not...
hololens at the moment?! i think :) http://channel9.msdn.com/?cr_cc=200624404	meh to lazy to take a pic with my phone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy2xshuutdq	why isnt your chimney sealed?
do you think that nodejs mongodb and backbone for the gront is a good solution for this website ?	hmm did you say something ? i got disconnected

 your error reporting question?	did you get your answer
 do you have a question?	is there one for redis call?
so ?	test file('\\server\file');
is there any reliable way to store a date other than timestamp?	define "reliable"

: will that make the env variable show up in info() ?	
and maybe 5k-10k active accounts ?	what you likely want is 1) a system where users can flag things 2) a system that compiles reports and generates a classification based upon the information 3) a queue for a person to manually review pass/fail
so for example i have 1 record in that users table, so i know a record exists, and when i do select id, username, password from users it shows me that 1 record so is my $result variable wrong?	 var_mp($result)
the 80s one?	the lightning looks real but the houses are fake

, what does your code look like?	but let me tell you the code too
what the hell? https://github.com/-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/psr-8-hug/psr-8-hug.md	whatever i make this shell_exec('sh playlister.sh /dev/null 2>/dev/null &')    (a shell script that load music playlists on mpd). my  server crashes. i am not sure if this is because i should not be calling .sh this way or if it just a  -s glitch
in .ini, why is that?	could be a few reasons.  start with the  error log to ensure it's not erroring out loading when you start the webserver.  next verify that the .ini file you're editing is the one  is reading.
<?=$var;?>	if you know python why don't you stick with django? )
what page?	 tl;dr - dirname(__file__)

i guess the 'nesting' feeling is helping with the unpacking?	i'm not a nester

, are you an npc?	i dont like drinking that much
: you can disable <?, but not <?=	it's not part of it?
old people? their browser might not even be capable of that.	 nah because then i would have to install that on the server
: so what changed?	i rebooted the computer
any suggestions what i’m doing wrong?	are you sure the exception is being thrown?
if so, your curl code looks fine - is it you that controls the api on the other end?	 indeed..
: what about docs?	im looking for reflection docs for the scalar type hints
so he wants me to part the channel?	that would be an option
is that something you really want to be doing though?	if you must loop over them perhaps they ought to be a single arg.  an array?
what are you trying to do ?	i need to ensure that a particular method that gets called twice is called with different arguments each time
who told you it has to be a blob?	is there a way to insert many elements (in a  code) in a mysql db as one element? like a list of things in an array that need to be put in the db in one field
, you're 6'?	kids or no kids?
 how?	https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/windows_me
in es6 does ‘…’ before a variable mean anything?	no it's just decorative
hey guys, if i do childclass = {}; childclass.prototype = new superclass(); can i then use the constructor from superclass to create a childclass object by invoking new childclass()? or how should i do that, since it doesn't seem to work	no. you'd do `superclass.call(this)` as the first line in childclass  (and childclass must be a function for the pattern you are thinking of.)
: roger that; so if you so something like namespace foo; require('bar.'); and bar. contains a statement: namespace bar; does the code following the require statement (in foo.) end up being within the bar namespace accidentally?	oh god no fadvise?!?!
pading?	you're 6'?
, if i don't write yourself into a corner?	i'm trying to install a local pear package using pyrus but it keeps telling me the channel is unknown how can i make pyrus ignore the channel?
, presumably those using 5.5 (which has opcache built in and switched on by default i should image) use a special version of xcache that works along side!?	*imagine
, is $h from user iut?	 tcp socket means you can easily scale horizontally unix socket is a micro-optimisation faster.
: what do you mean?	 no they're seperate mechanisms. write your code such that it doesn't cause errors/warnings and throw exceptions instead i guess
, it'll go to seven, who has home court advantage, spurs?	or the copyright would eventually expire
i'm having trouble using a simple strtok to remove a space, i think because it is a &nbsp; character... can someone help? http://codepad..com/kwwc7j	 it depends if you are talking about a userbase of 100s 1000s 100000s etc
can you recommend me a grep script? i got a bunch of files and want to find text in it.	what does he mean? does he refer to project requirements (business logic) or the technological concepts?
i have a string containing some h - where i'd like to retrieve data related to a given data-attribute. what's the easiest way of getting around this? regex? hiring slave labor? or something else?	 dom?
: you can also advice him you know?	 that i can do later first i need to show some results are coming
: this might be stupid. but if you're allowed to require javascript then what about storing the session id or some access token in local storage, and injecting it into an authorization header of all requests? then you wouldn't have to add it as a get param to all pages	why not just let  handle it since it already has code for "if cookies are dsiabled add it into the url transparently"?
, your complete url is thus: http://api.odnoklassniki.ru/fb.do?application_key=cbamcjpdebabababa&expires=2015.05.06 12:12&last_access_range=2015.04.08-2015.04.22&method=notifications.sendmass&status=a&text=asdf&sig=dacf440d213528c6c3d25b6c37a5698a	you still have whitespace in expires

: what do you mean by action?	use xdebug and create a trace log
mockery experts? anyone? can you inspect call history?	not to help you! o
you don't even know basic english, so who are you to talk?	jsnfwlr!*@* added to ignore list.
: so in all definition of anything extending \foo\foo it'll need to define the same static method?	..
so why would braces be necessary there?	it's valid without bracers
as opposed to str_replace? i tried that first but also had no luck so i was just hoping there was some difference with the replace portion	and yes i mean inline h
is it really though ?	si ti really

 message: fatal error: call to a member function set() on null <--- how can i trap this one? i tried "try" and } catch (exception $e) {... but doesnt seem to work?	and when i think about it as logically as i can... it sounds to me like it would work.. but then i would be faced with possible image extension files that are actually malicious code
err, how would the smoke get out?	very good
will something like this work? (!count($results) == 10)	!=
: but why do you want that?	dynamic react page. everything is determined from json. so each component may have sub-components(again dynamic) and so on. so the higher ups asked if it was possible to convert all the `.map` functions into their corresponding output before serving to the user. less functions more performant.. i guess thats what they were ultimately going for
what is $isset ?	does anyone happen to have a server on hetzner that could run a traceroute?
