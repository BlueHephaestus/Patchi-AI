<DarkElement>	 guys how can my java function accept any value as a parameter?
<mebigfatguy>	ddefine the parm as Object
<DarkElement>	ahh,thnaks
<DarkElement>	It does not work with double, however.
<mebigfatguy>	it would work for Double
<DarkElement>		public static void print(Object var){
<DarkElement>			System.out.println(var);
<DarkElement>		}
<DarkElement>	trying to do this, "not applicable"
<mebigfatguy>	print(Double.valueOf(1.1))
<ojacobson>	DarkElement: javac -version?
<mebigfatguy>	you can't specify a parmaeter type that handles both primitive values and objects
<DarkElement>	alright
<i-make-robots>	mebigfatguy - thanks for trying to help.  I'll probably just use export for now and fix maven in the next edition.
