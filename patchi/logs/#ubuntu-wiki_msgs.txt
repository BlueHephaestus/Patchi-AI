<elfy> hi hannie
<hannie> hey there, elfy
<elfy> we are official now then i guess - the log bot is here :)
<hannie> ok, that is good news
<elfy> yep - we'll have to be serious now :)
<hannie> i am just reading the ubuntu-manual meeting logs (i did not attend)
<elfy> i might start hanging around in the channel soon - just to get a feel for people
<hannie> here is a useful link: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology
<hannie> i am not sure if ubuntulog2 and meetingology use the same code
<elfy> i have no idea - as far as i know the log bots are just for getting channels onto here - http://irclogs.ubuntu.com
<hannie> http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2012/05/19/%23ubuntu-manual.html#t19:05
<hannie> this is the log i am just reading
<hannie> and we use meetingology
<hannie> the chair can use commands like # startmeeting, #topic, #vote etc.
<elfy> i realise that - i'd assume that meetingology was there for meeting use - the channel also has ubuntulog in it i see
<hannie> you are right. here we only have ubuntulog2 (thusfar)
<elfy> yep
<elfy> will check to see if it is logging to the irclogs.ubuntu.com later
<hannie> ok, so far i am happy the way we communicate (irc and m/list)
<elfy> yea me too - it's just that as this is 'offifical' we thought there should be logs available - it would make it easier for us too - we can check if we've been away for a while
<elfy> alan bell i think is the one to ask about meetingology - might be good to have it here for meetings
<hannie> i was just going to ask: can we have meetingology here? are you going to ask alan bell?
<elfy> i can do that
<hannie> great!
<hannie> i also see manualbot at #ubuntu-manual. no idea what this bot does
<elfy> have to now - it's on the blueprint to remind me :)
<hannie> ah, good old blueprint
<elfy> :)
<elfy> do you remember offhand if we decided to have a page to list done wiki's - i can't remember - if you can't don't worry - i will dig it out from my logs
<hannie> i think not
<elfy> okey doke
<hannie> with all these separate pages, is it possible to have them together at some place or other?
<elfy> the 3 list pages?
<hannie> like you put something in a folder?
<hannie> yes, 3 and perhaps one coming
<elfy> no idea to be honest - question can be asked - i'd have thought not - but they are all linked from one place in 'our wiki world'
<hannie> i have the links in my favorites, but i was just thinking if they can be gathered somewhere
<hannie> no big deal. just a thought
<elfy> we can think about it and ask someone - no problem with that
<elfy> and what's the 'perhaps one coming' ... :)
<hannie> the wiki's done page
<elfy> ok - you think there is a need?
<hannie> not yet, but maybe in the future
<elfy> mmm - if we have a need - better to have one now - or someone will have a long list to add in one go
<hannie> like i said before, when we have less work to do for the manual i will spend more time on ubforums2wiki
<elfy> yea - i understand :)
<elfy> i'll add it to blueprint as a thought
<hannie> good idea, so we won't forget
<elfy> yep
<hannie> you know what i think of when you use the name elfy? lotr
<elfy> :)
<elfy> you'd like my urukhai nick then lol
<hannie> or harry potter
<elfy> oh dear :(
<elfy> :p
<hannie> urukhai is from starwars?
<elfy> urukhai are from lotr
<elfy> the bigger nastier goblins lol
<hannie> argggg. stupid me
<elfy> :)
<hannie> i just listened to my cd lotr
<hannie> great music
<hannie> especially enya
<elfy> i like enya
<hannie> me too, and clannad
<elfy> blast from the past that is
<hannie> but still good music (i find at least)
<elfy> yep
<elfy> back in a while - daughter home now
<hannie> ok, back to work for me. cya
<elfy> cya
<elfy> wildmanne39: hi and notice the log bot finally
<mgandtl> is there a way to mark the pages on the import page as "in progress" or "bagged by x"? don't want to start and then have someone else do it. :)
<wildmanne39> hi elfy
<elfy> mgandtl: not at the moment
<elfy> not been a problem as yet - start a m/list thread perhaps to get views on it
<mgandtl> we have a mailing list?
<elfy> it seems at the moment that people who started the ball rolling with a thread are doing the wiki
<elfy> mgandtl: yes - at https://launchpad.net/~ubforums2ubwiki
<elfy> and a blueprint
<mgandtl> ah. okay, i'll go join that.
