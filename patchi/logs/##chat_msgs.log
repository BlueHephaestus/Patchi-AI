apr 28 23:02:42 <pingfloyd>	maybe you can put regularity on your resume now
apr 28 23:03:46 <caselogic>	resume..what's that
apr 28 23:03:51 <pingfloyd>	the tough part is deciding whether to put it under skills or achievements
apr 28 23:04:36 <penguin1263>	using a pi as a web server looooool
apr 28 23:05:47 <pingfloyd>	i'm sure it would work fine for low traffic
apr 28 23:06:04 <caselogic>	skills.
apr 28 23:06:10 <penguin1263>	oh my god
apr 28 23:06:18 <penguin1263>	at&t's "u-verse"
apr 28 23:06:29 <penguin1263>	is a fucking steaming pile of complete bullcrap!

apr 28 23:27:45 <rexrat>	yayyy! o_o
apr 28 23:27:55 <nealshire>	subscription based home security is so overrated. a raspi system could be made to call emergency people for a much lower price
apr 28 23:32:24 <rexrat>	yeah they're usually for rich people who cannot *afford to think* about security by themselves.
apr 28 23:33:58 <rexrat>	so they usually go for the fresh tv ad that has a smiling and dancing family with a certain *blah blah complete home security system*.
apr 28 23:35:04 <rexrat>	and they're the ones to get exploited by naughty guys later. corporate softwares i tell. uses visual basic and runs on microsoft windows.
apr 28 23:37:04 <rexrat>	so i was at this airport that had a bsod screen on the flight notification board. uses windows. even hospitals, telecommunications use xp still.
apr 28 23:38:13 <nomelette>	nobody cares rexrat

<rootsleep>	i had sex earlier but it was under a minute.. it still counts..
<dw1>	rofl
<treefiddy_>	it's a challenge thing
<treefiddy_>	it's not about the sex
<rexrat>	it's about humanity.
<rexrat>	:p
<dw1>	ok they may be having sex
<dw1>	idk
<treefiddy_>	haha
<dw1>	thanks guys

<pingfloyd>	sure, blame the adderall
<dw1>	never know with weird hippie people

<rootsleep>	im gettin old. i just tell my woman if you aint packin your bags in time the train is leavin bitch
<dw1>	sounds like a wind chime walking aroud
<atom138>	unless im on stimulants

<treefiddy_>	roflmao
<treefiddy_>	bust in hay! wut u doin!?
<tortib>	treefiddy_, want to help me run for president?
<treefiddy_>	tortib: no
<rexrat>	women being ready in 5 minutes and men coming home in 5 minutes is the same.
<pingfloyd>	don't be a cock blocker
<tortib>	treefiddy_, why so harsh?
<rootsleep>	whats the difference between a woman and a computer ??? a computer doesnt fart when you insert a 3 1/2 inch floppy
<atom138>	you wont make a girl cum without going to town on her clit with your mouth
<treefiddy_>	tortib: you asked me if i wanted to. i said no haha
<treefiddy_>	tortib: no harshness,. i just dont want to
<atom138>	you can but it requires more than know how
<tortib>	treefiddy_, you don't think i would be a good president?
<swift110-phone>	lol
<treefiddy_>	tortib: idk, prolly. im anti-politics.
<atom138>	nobody would be a good president
<atom138>	because thats not what is the problem
<tortib>	i'm the unoffical president of the internet
<swift110-phone>	lol
<tortib>	treefiddy_ is the unoffical secretary of defense for the internet
<equinoxdawg>	can i assassinate you then
<tortib>	me and him roll together
<tortib>	equinoxdawg, uh, if you can ddos i suppose so

<tortib>	do about wat
<atom138>	ammend the international acl
<swift110-phone>	ok
<tortib>	atom138, i think it would be fair to allow internets to flow freely to all members of earth.
<atom138>	preach
<tortib>	we are all in this together, internets should be made available to everyone, at a reasonable cost with the ability to perform reasonable actions on the internets.
<idioterna>	hi
<idioterna>	atom138: that's not true
<swift110-phone>	ok
<swift110-phone>	hey tortib

<screwsss>	none?
<screwsss>	surely theres one
<idioterna>	atom138: i think it's more of a rule that if you have regular partners, you can take the time to learn their specific modes of operation
<swift110-phone>	no screws so stop asking
<screwsss>	well

<sunstar>	whordiots
<atom138>	you can get ocular herpes
<atom138>	so im guessing if you can get in your eyes then you can give it with your eyes
<tortib>	i want revenge sooooo bad
<tortib>	so bad i can taste it
<atom138>	for what
<idioterna>	revenge doesn't work
<idioterna>	get over it
<tortib>	idioterna, how does it not work?
<atom138>	did you get chlamydia or something?
<pingfloyd>	khan!!!
<tortib>	atom138, thankfully no
<atom138>	the clap?
<tortib>	naw
<atom138>	then what
<tortib>	just a lot of distress
<idioterna>	tortib: doesn't do anything
<idioterna>	don't get even, get odd!
<tortib>	idioterna, yeah i know that's why i'm going to try a different approach
<atom138>	dox on 4chan
<idioterna>	tortib: let me show you something
<vodkode>	eh take the shots and get over it, its no big deal
<tortib>	i'm going to see how it pans out or if it even materializes
<idioterna>	tortib: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spdak1z0dza
<swift110-phone>	s' is "v"f:;jlol
<vodkode>	if you screw around enough your bound to catch something
<tortib>	idioterna, lol princess bride
<idioterna>	yeah
<idioterna>	it's full of serious wisdom
<idioterna>	anyway, when you find the people you're about to take revenge on remember to say
<idioterna>	"hello,"
<idioterna>	you know the rest i presume
<tortib>	heheh
<rootsleep>	atom138 isnt 4chan for pedos ?? :/
<tortib>	idioterna, have to wait to see what happens though, not sure who i can trust at the moment.
<idioterna>	i don't think you can trust anyone, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't
<tortib>	well, i know i have more enemies than friends
<idioterna>	that's normal
<idioterna>	there are few people anyone can describe as their friends
<tortib>	idioterna, if you cannot trust someone then why should i?
<idioterna>	do you have a choice?
<tortib>	well not entirely
<idioterna>	it's how the universe works
<tortib>	yeah, i'm just going to make sure i cover my basis prior to doing anything.
<idioterna>	you do your best to decide if you can trust someone
<pingfloyd>	you have to know how far you can trust each person
<idioterna>	but you can't know that
<idioterna>	you either get shafted or they earn a little more trust
<pingfloyd>	that's where intuition comes in
<tortib>	by the time you know how far you can trust someone, it's already too late because they broke that trust in order for you to actually be able to recognize what they can and can't be trusted with.
<idioterna>	yes, exactly
<pingfloyd>	some people don't have much of it, some do
<idioterna>	but with time you get better
<idioterna>	and because of this you have fewer friends
<idioterna>	but better ones
<idioterna>	usually.
<tortib>	well, i don't even know which people in my life are my friends.
<rootsleep>	trust is an illusion
<tortib>	it's for sure not my parents.
<pingfloyd>	is there really even friends?
<tortib>	no
<tortib>	i don't think i have any actual friends
<pingfloyd>	or just allies?
<tortib>	pingfloyd, not even allies, but to a degree they are.
<pingfloyd>	allies at certain times
<tortib>	frienemies is the best way to describe them
<idioterna>	i have a couple of good friends
<pingfloyd>	usually by a common enemy
<pingfloyd>	the enemy of my enemy is my friend
<tortib>	pingfloyd, they are the common enemy
<idioterna>	but that means they can trust me and i won't let them down
<idioterna>	i can't account for their actions, merely my own
<pingfloyd>	in politics there is no trust, only forced hands
<atom138>	4chan is for pedos as much as reddit is for bronies and zoofiliacs
<tortib>	every single time i have tried to rely on a "friend" they have let me down.
<tortib>	every time.
<atom138>	not friends
<coldsparrow>	stop whining.
<idioterna>	tortib: that's not so rare
<vodkode>	tortib what are you mad about?
<idioterna>	tortib: and it also comes down to what you expect of your friends
<pingfloyd>	he wants revenge on kirk for leaving him on seti-alpha 6
<tortib>	coldsparrow, if you would like to partake in this conversation i would recommend you input something that is actually constructive to the conversation except blurting out immature insults like a child.
<coldsparrow>	tortib, suck me
<tortib>	vodkode, i'm not angry about anything.
<tortib>	coldsparrow, no that's okay, you have your daddy to do that.
<vodkode>	i expect my friends to drink my beer, eat my food and attempt to scarf up my old computers
<vodkode>	tortib i mean like, what happened?
<vodkode>	what did your friend do to you, etc
<tortib>	too much stuff to name off man
<vodkode>	ok
<idioterna>	i find taking it easy and laughing at yourself works best
<sunstar>	anyone gonna watch the pacquiao vs mayweather fight?
<idioterna>	why would anyone watch a fight
<noah`>	mastersmarty
<vodkode>	friends come and friends go, when you have money you have tons of friends, when you go broke they disappear, it is how it is
<vodkode>	the trick is to be very careful with who you call 'friend'
<idioterna>	well it's fairly easy
<rexrat>	i have no friends.
<rexrat>	except for my family.
<idioterna>	friends are those you're prepared to give your life for
<diogenese>	i have a dog.
<idioterna>	but not those that would do the same for you
<fowler>	that's a pretty extreme definition, idioterna
<rexrat>	but they're family, not friends. no they're friend too. a friend in need is a friend indeed.
<idioterna>	fowler: sure
<vodkode>	i have a pet dog, my fiancee, some of her family and a couple guys i grew up with, thats it and i'm not shopping for anymore
<idioterna>	fowler: and sometimes people do that for even a stranger
<idioterna>	so maybe sometimes even strangers can be friends
<idioterna>	vodkode: i have a pet dog too
<idioterna>	i've had dogs all my life
<tortib>	diogenese, wooo dogs! :d
<diogenese>	:)
<idioterna>	bored them to death with my monologues
<idioterna>	but talking to a dog is a really good way of clearing your mind
<coldsparrow>	i like pulling my whiskers out.
<fowler>	i've had dogs my whole life, too
<fowler>	except for the last two semesters
<fowler>	and the next year
<fowler>	dorm life, no pets allowed
<coldsparrow>	fowler, i've owned two dogs
<vodkode>	i have a dog and a cat, the cat is a friend too, but i'm also keenly aware if i was accidentally shrunken by an act of magic or such, she would eat me
<tortib>	how does someone actually become a friend though?  wouldn't you have to technically befriend a strange?
<idioterna>	yeah cats are different
<idioterna>	we have four cats
<fowler>	i've had lots of dogs
<idioterna>	tortib: yes
<tortib>	people are all strangers to each other, the only way to be friend them is actually speak with the person.
<idioterna>	tortib: it's easy when you have the resources
<fowler>	let's see . . . i mean, at least half a dozen
<tortib>	idioterna, of course.
<badon>	hi tortib
<tortib>	ayyy badon
<coldsparrow>	fowler, do you ever get the feeling that this chatroom is full of clients belonging to the same guy having conversations with himself?
<vodkode>	i count my fiancee my best friend because when we met i was sick (with a tumor), 100% broke (sickness will do that to ya) and i looked like an obese albino that had rolled in rocksalt and got a bad haircut after
<fowler>	i can only think of six with names
<fowler>	coldsparrow: nope
<tortib>	we're on irc talking to each other behind a screen.  but i bet you none of you here would consider the other person a friend.
<fowler>	wait, seven!
<vodkode>	that lady not only financially supported me but took care of me for over a year of that shit, thats a friend
<idioterna>	vodkode: sounds about right
<idioterna>	vodkode: never let her down.
<fowler>	tortib: i consider irc collectively as a friend
<coldsparrow>	fowler, did you ever have a corgi? those are the king of dogs
<tortib>	fowler, so do i but there are also many enemies.
<tortib>	i have literally grown up on irc
<fowler>	eh, i have no enemies on irc
<fowler>	tortib: me too
<vodkode>	i won't
<fowler>	irc and message boards
<coldsparrow>	irc is just a way for me to occupy my hands and eyes
<coldsparrow>	i've been on irc for over 20 years
<fowler>	the internet is basically a friend with an enormous breadth of interests and a fluid, completely dynamic personality
<tortib>	fowler, you may not know if they are enemies yet or not...time can only tell.
<coldsparrow>	it aint as good as it was
<coldsparrow>	lol @ fowler
<fowler>	tortib: they aren't enemies right now
<tortib>	you may have enemies that you might not even know.
<fowler>	no
<tortib>	but they might know you.
<fowler>	i don't
<fowler>	0% chance
<tortib>	how would you know if you didn't know?
<coldsparrow>	fowler is a nice guy, he has no natural enemies.
<fowler>	i've never had an enemy
<tortib>	well you're doing something terribly wrong then.
<coldsparrow>	tortib, how ever, is a rotten little bastard who deserves to be shot.
<fowler>	i don't have many interactions that could possibly spawn enemies
<tortib>	coldsparrow, wtf?
<pingfloyd>	that sounds optimistic
<tortib>	why should i be shot?
<rexrat>	he who doesn't have an enemy doesn't have a friend either.
<fowler>	rexrat: shallow platitude
<coldsparrow>	tortib, because youa sk too many stupid questions.
<rexrat>	fowler:  what's your latitude.
<coldsparrow>	*ask
<tortib>	coldsparrow, i see, what kind of questions have i asked that you deem stupid?
<coldsparrow>	that one.
<fowler>	rexrat: i
<fowler>	uh
<tortib>	and it's stupid how exactly?
<fowler>	i have no idea
<coldsparrow>	gfy
<rexrat>	mine is 23.332 e - 36.2253 w
<idioterna>	fowler: a time zone should suffice
<treefiddy_>	!! yess gfy
<fowler>	rexrat: i don't know my latitude
<fowler>	i don't even know my longitude
<fowler>	i'm in montana doe
<tortib>	coldsparrow, what i think is occurring is that you have nothing to say at all so you're stating that i ask stupid questions.
<rexrat>	good luck using google maps.
<coldsparrow>	tortib, gfy
<tortib>	you as well coldsparrow
<idioterna>	so mountain time zone?
<fowler>	idioterna: probably
<fowler>	an hour ahead of the west coast
<tortib>	coldsparrow, you're a very odd person.
<idioterna>	i'm in the mountains as well
<rexrat>	yep.
<tortib>	coldsparrow, do you have some sort of love-hate relationship towards me?
<diogenese>	got mountains here too.
<idioterna>	but central european time
<fowler>	idioterna: i'm amongst mountains, but i'm in a valley
<idioterna>	oh
<idioterna>	yeah, that'd be more correct
<fowler>	i can't imagine living somewhere without mountains nearby and in view, though
<rexrat>	how long have you guys known each other tortib coldsparrow ?
<tortib>	rexrat, not very long at all
<idioterna>	yeah it gets weird on flat land
<tortib>	i have no idea who that person is.
<fowler>	idioterna: mountains and trees
<rexrat>	how long? in days.
<diogenese>	i don't like flat land much.
<idioterna>	fowler: https://bou.si/pic/batch/spring-saturday
<idioterna>	like this
<fowler>	i like flat land, but i like mountains at least nearby
<coldsparrow>	rexrat, eat me
<fowler>	so i can see them and sometimes walk on them
<fowler>	this town is really flat, though, which is nice for walking and such
<rexrat>	so why are you guys too involved then>
<fowler>	with mountains very close
<fowler>	idioterna: yes
<fowler>	that's very nice
<tortib>	rexrat, i don't know they just jumped my shit all of a sudden stating that i ask stupid questions...
<fowler>	idioterna: https://www.flickr.com/photos/29682929@n08/15255196447/
<fowler>	that's a hike i went on about 10 miles away from where i live
<hmir_d>	smoochies!
<tortib>	rexrat, i first saw their name a day ago, i have been conversing with them for about a total of 30min (and that's being generous with time).
<idioterna>	fowler: nice, that's way higher than where i am
<rexrat>	oh, that's interesting.
<fowler>	idioterna: this town is at like a mile above sea level
<idioterna>	i'd have to go about 30 miles to get to the mountains
<mmango>	eiooooo
<equinoxdawg>	tortib: he comes here with a bunch of different nicks. caselogic, redsparrow etc
<idioterna>	fowler: https://bou.si/pic/batch/alpe
<fowler>	idioterna: yeah, i'm only about 10 minutes out, it's real nice. back home in washington was about the same living near seattle
<fowler>	30-40 mins to the foothills
<fowler>	the same as you, i mean
<idioterna>	well i have a bicycle so that's about two hours for me :)
<fowler>	2-3 hours drive to real mountains back home
<fowler>	this was taken from my dad's property: https://www.flickr.com/photos/29682929@n08/14315995537/
<idioterna>	do you ski?
<fowler>	nope
<idioterna>	me neither
<idioterna>	i used to ski a lot but just can't find the time since i got kids
<noah`>	who thinks mastersmarty should register on freenode so he can talk in here?
<fowler>	that mountain is like an hour from my dad's place and my dad's place is like 90 mins from where i lived in washington
<idioterna>	now i just cycle a lot
<fowler>	so 2-3 hours to the biggest mountain in the lower 48
<rexrat>	so that 2 hours and 30 minutes.
<rexrat>	wow i'm really smart. :p
<idioterna>	yeah
<fowler>	rexrat: a+
<fowler>	also a sticker
<rexrat>	thanks.
<rexrat>	lollipop too.
<fowler>	no
<fowler>	i'm not a doctor and you didn't get a shot
<rexrat>	yess!!!!!
<fowler>	you have to get a shot if you want a lollipop
<rexrat>	oops i forgot it's not the dentist.
<rexrat>	glitch while channeling childhood memories into chat
<fowler>	idioterna: i miss living in washington :(
<fowler>	washington state is the best state imo
<fowler>	nature wise
<hmir_d>	nope!
<idioterna>	my ceo lives in seattle
<hmir_d>	canada!
<hmir_d>	<.<
<idioterna>	oh
<idioterna>	well yeah
<idioterna>	i loved banff
<idioterna>	hehe
<fowler>	so much variety of landscape in such a small area. rainforest and beaches, a sea, tons of islands to explore, temperate forest, mountain tundra, desert steppes, canyons and gorges
<atom138>	derby weekend is set to be gorgeous i have a social event boner
<fowler>	you could see all of those in one day in washington
<idioterna>	fowler: yeah, i live in slovenia so
<vodkode>	what is the rain like though fowler
<idioterna>	fowler: we're having almost all that
<idioterna>	there's not much coast
<fowler>	vodkode: it rains a lot but it doesn't rain hard very often at all, and the spring and summer are real nice
<vodkode>	i live in florida, its 365 days a year of warmth and about 300 of sunshine, there are a lot of hillbillies but its not that bad
<fowler>	fall and winter is a lot of overcast and light rain, which personally i love
<fowler>	and every season is mild
<fowler>	barely gets below freezing in the winter, barely gets above 80 in the summer
<atom138>	florida has rain every day
<atom138>	4pm
<fowler>	there's really more drizzle than rain in washington for the most part
<fowler>	a lot of places on the east coast get rain less frequently, but when it rains it fucking pours
<fowler>	and the overall precipitation is about the same
<fowler>	i prefer the drizzle
<treefiddy_>	what's the shizzle dizzle?
<joze>	east coast drizzle fo shore
<vodkode>	atom138 depends where you live
<vodkode>	really does

<vodkode>	huge state, 7 different climate zones
<fowler>	that part of washington is beautiful
<vodkode>	miami, yep, every day
<fowler>	i love visiting eastern washington'
<fowler>	just wouldn't want to live there
<butt3rfly>	morning
<vodkode>	where i am, small town, inverness, north of tampa, its dry, almost arid, cactus grows here
<fowler>	a lot of eastern washington is dry and arid, but no cacti afaik
<fowler>	just a lot of sage and shrubs and such
<fowler>	sagebrush*
<atom138>	orlando too
<fowler>	driving over the cascades is so cool. dense forest on one side, desert on the other
<fowler>	dat rainshadow
<tortib>	i need gud gaem to play
<atom138>	me toop
<atom138>	playing heartstone now, my pc blows
<tortib>	heh i know who you are atom138
<atom138>	who
<duckgoose>	atom ant
<atom138>	yep
<tortib>	23:21:22  :[atom138]:	playing heartstone now, my pc blows
<tortib>	i know there was a hidden meaning behind that
<bobita>	hi all
<tortib>	hi
<sunstar>	hi
<treefiddy_>	hai
<butt3rfly>	i think i might organise a maypole event next year
<tortib>	illuminati confirmed
<butt3rfly>	i was looking for one to take my youngest kid to and i'm going to have to travel miles
<sunstar>	ooo yeah maypole!
<duckgoose>
<tortib>	gooseduck
<butt3rfly>	it came up in discussion that our education system in the uk has totally destroyed community events like maypole dancing
<sunstar>	cuz its a pagan event
<duckgoose>	maypo9le dancing
<tallguy>	lol pagen huh
<duckgoose>	sounds awfully white to me
<tallguy>	pagan
<pingfloyd>	it would be okay if it were christian though
<pingfloyd>	the hypocrisy and melding of church and state
<butt3rfly>	well i'm not religious, the only reason it interests me is at a 'community' level
<pingfloyd>	like it matters if it is pagan anyway
<tortib>	all women are religious
<pingfloyd>	most holidays are pagan in origin
<pingfloyd>	christmas is based on yule
<butt3rfly>	everything is based on pagan holidays because pagans partied every day lol
<pingfloyd>	where do you think christmas trees came from?
<vodkode>	from jesus
<pingfloyd>	christian celebrate pagan holidays, they're just too ignorant to realize it
<sunstar>	^
<butt3rfly>	a real pagan has 4 celebrations every month
<sunstar>	you mention anything pagan and people get all weird
<vodkode>	yeah, damn bigots
<vodkode>	whats incredible if that you'll talk to someone who believes in <x> religion and if they hear of something like multiverse theory, panspermia, etc etc etc they will dismiss it as insane/paranoid thought
<duckgoose>	not buddists!
<pingfloyd>	that's because it doesn't fit into their belief
<atom138>	their entire reality is based off these things
<atom138>	youre asking someone to willingly and manually have ego death
<atom138>	its impossible
<vodkode>	some buddhists are incredibly dogmatic, tibet was a veritable hell for the average person when it was a theocracy
<atom138>	buddhism isnt even the same
<atom138>	same with hindi
<pingfloyd>	buddhism is more of a philosophy
<pingfloyd>	and way of life
<atom138>	yeah
<atom138>	its a perspective
<pingfloyd>	same with kung fu
<vodkode>	you have theraveda, mahayana and about 500 regions derivatives thereof broken down into many thousands of micro-regional traditions
<duckgoose>	religion: a pursuit or interest to which someone ascribes supreme importance.
<duckgoose>	>:[
<pingfloyd>	and the two go hand in hand if we're talking chinese buddhism
<vodkode>	but your average westerner who picks up the sutras and decides its cool to wear beads calls themself a buddhist and people cue off that for an opinion of the ideology
<nullvalue>	good morning all
<pingfloyd>	vodkode: yeah, it's stupid
<vodkode>	its like getting ideas upon japanese samurai culture by watching chris farley in his moomoo smash up a hollywood set
<pingfloyd>	vodkode: if i were going to become a buddhist i'd at least join a shaolin monastery
<vodkode>	or at least learn what a shaolin monastery is
<nullvalue>	i like ninja's better than samurai
<treefiddy_>	here comes stabby claus here comes stabby claus right down stabby claus lane!
<pingfloyd>	i would consider myself at that point a kung-fuist though
<vodkode>	most of the books on buddhism are second or even third hand information they were written by westerners who didn't even speak let alone read let alone visit the traditions they've adopted
<vodkode>	chef boyardi religion
<nullvalue>	i have mastered the arts of a ninja
<coldsparrow>	nah
<duckgoose>	vodkode are you a buddhist
<vodkode>	no, not at all, i did however study theology
<atom138>	nihilist
<coldsparrow>	buddhism is not a religion
<milkmaid>	hey
<treefiddy_>	yesterday man, i was a nihilist, now today im just to fuggin bored
<pingfloyd>	nullvalue: ninjas aren't really that badass
<duckgoose>	‹duckgoose›  religion: a pursuit or interest to which someone ascribes supreme importance.
<duckgoose>	it is sucka
<nullvalue>	not my type of ninja's
<pingfloyd>	nullvalue: a shaolin monk would easily own one
<pingfloyd>	like ever heard of chi-gung?
<nullvalue>	glad no shoalin monks around so us ninja's pretty much kickass
<nullvalue>	yes i have
<pingfloyd>	some of the stuff in the movies is embellished, but that shit is real
<vodkode>	for me, what's been interesting to study have been the nde's of the past 15 - 20 years
<nullvalue>	ping im good at making ninja weapons
<duckgoose>	vodkode you claim to know that "most of the books on buddhism are second or even third hand information" but that would require your reading of most of the books
<duckgoose>	js
<treefiddy_>	what color of ninja weapons?
<nullvalue>	not much a fan of buddism not tht i dont respect other religions
<vodkode>	near death experiences are now so common worldwide because of technology for resuscitation becoming so widespread/cheap and effective that its leading to a gradual shift in the perception of consciousness amongst a fairly literate and sober group of scientists
<pingfloyd>	say you joined a shaolin monastery, what weapon would you specialize in?
<pingfloyd>	i'd probably go with broad swords
<atom138>	daibo
<nullvalue>	treefiddy_: what?? do you have to colour code weapons, mines mostly steel
<nullvalue>	i prefer katana's
<vodkode>	duckgoose not really, not at all, when a guy with the last name johnson writes a book purporting to be a yogi i pretty well know its a crock of shit
<atom138>	not shaolin
<treefiddy_>	nullvalue: you passed the test. you may proceed
<nullvalue>	heh
<treefiddy_>	hehe
<pingfloyd>	has to be shaolin
<duckgoose>	sounds like assumptions to me :>
<nullvalue>	im a swordsmith
<vodkode>	i have read many books on buddhism, zorastricism, vedic culture, quabbalism and about a dozen other religious/spiritual and philosophical systems, its pretty straight forward, buddhism is a term thrown around like a dollar whore at a port of call in this country and numerous others
<nullvalue>	modern swordsmith
<coldsparrow>	vodkode, well that is aninteresting euphemism
<pingfloyd>	if you're going to learn buddhism, go to the source
<vodkode>	anyone who can memorize a handful of core concepts can then tack on anything else they wish, claim it to be buddhism and write a sham book and sell it for a buck, its done all the time here
<pingfloyd>	otherwise you're probably being mislead
<nullvalue>	pingfloyd: i recommend thailand
<sabotender>	moo 🐮
<sabotender>	pingfloyd: o/
<atom138>	its all mislead
<vodkode>	exactly pingfloyd
<nullvalue>	they hardcore buddists
<pingfloyd>	i'd go to china myself
<sabotender>	greetings
<coldsparrow>	china doesnt understand the buddha, go to tibet
<sunstar>	we have a buddist temple here.   yuppies are trying to get it shut down.  the current compaint: their vast volumes of literature are a fire hazard
<vodkode>	there are valid books on every subject, it's just that buddhism is so confused with 'new ageism' here that its defacto assumed to be many things it is not
<nullvalue>	buddism could be practiced anywhere you just have to find the knowledge its not tht hard
<duckgoose>	vodkode by what you've said i assume you feel you have a deeper understanding of religion than the people that actually follow said religion
<coldsparrow>	i prefer samsara
<atom138>	they are trying to adapt the ideology to modern times
<nullvalue>	they have boks and stuff tht outta help
<atom138>	they are th only ones trying to
<nullvalue>	coldsparrow: dont u mean kamasutra
<nullvalue>	:p
<coldsparrow>	hur
<coldsparrow>	i dunno kamasutra
<vodkode>	duckgoose i have an understanding that buddhism does indeed exist and what it is, is not 'anything anyone decides' it is
<sabotender>	oh dear, what did i walk into
<nullvalue>	its a religion too
<coldsparrow>	tantric sex is good enough for me
<nullvalue>	sabotender: religeous talks
<nullvalue>	ok good for u coldsparrow
<duckgoose>	vodkode i'm talking about christianity
<sabotender>	bazhang: unusual for you to still be opted. did you recently kickban someone and forget to 'hide' yourself?
<nullvalue>	well bbl guys
<sabotender>	duck....duck....duck....goose!
<nullvalue>	i have to have breakfast and go to work
<nullvalue>	see ya at work all
<treefiddy_>	sabotender: he's voice, he set himself +v
<nullvalue>	laterz ppl
<sabotender>	ah, i misread :-p
<sabotender>	voice and op look similar on this thing
<nullvalue>	./ mode ##chat +v treefiddy_
<treefiddy_>	i have plenty of that i dont need it here too haha
<tortib>	i am in 11 channels while connected to 3 networks. i have 0 o:lines, 2 ops, 0 halfops, and 1 voice with power over 11 individual users.
<duckgoose>	vodkode are you smarter than christians
<duckgoose>	in your opinion
<vodkode>	no, nor do i purport to be, nor do i denigrate christians whatsoever
<treefiddy_>	denigrate all religion
<duckgoose>	‹vodkode›  whats incredible if that you'll talk to someone who believes in <x> religion and if they hear of something like multiverse theory, panspermia, etc etc etc they will dismiss it as insane/paranoid thought
<duckgoose>	but...
<vodkode>	if anything i respect their overall consistency
<sunstar>	prosetylizers
<sunstar>	the lot of ya!
<treefiddy_>	not i
<vodkode>	<x> as in <insert dogmatic religion> duckgoose
<vodkode>	not x as in christian
<treefiddy_>	ive cast off my security blanket
<pingfloyd>	i respect some christians i've known
<duckgoose>	vodkode you said you don't denigrate christians whatsoever
<pingfloyd>	they practice what they preach, except they don't preach
<pingfloyd>	they're more of the mind lead by example
<tortib>	they don't practice either
<treefiddy_>	i used to
<treefiddy_>	but they're the ones that keep getting into congress
<treefiddy_>	and really fucking things up for the rest of us
<tortib>	indeed they are
<duckgoose>	i'm not a religious man but i'm also not one to tell people what to believe
<duckgoose>	or in this case what not to believe
<tortib>	every single religious person i have met has not been a kind person
<pingfloyd>	i really don't care what people believe as long as they stay out of my way
<vodkode>	duckgoose, clearly you misunderstood my point there, my point was that many religious people - of all types - become hardend in their beliefs to the point of looking at those with other beliefs as insane/irrational when a objective eye would classify them both as equally irrational
<tortib>	then again also people who are not religious are pretty crude as well.  i think people just suck in general.
<duckgoose>	it's one thing to talk about how silly a religion is but it's offensive to say all followers of "<x>" act in any particular way
<coldsparrow>	pingfloyd, cuz you're on the fast-track, right
<vodkode>	there is nothing rational about faith, it isn't supposed to be rational in the spiritual sense
<butt3rfly>	i must say i am surprised that no-one jumped on the phalic symbolism of the maypole
<treefiddy_>	oh
<butt3rfly>	you guys never cease to amaze me
<butt3rfly>	lol
<treefiddy_>	oh baby
<treefiddy_>	jump on?
<butt3rfly>	lol treefiddy_
<treefiddy_>	the phallus? :o
<pingfloyd>	i think women notice things like that more
<pingfloyd>	when you got one, it's so normalized
<pingfloyd>	but if something looks like a pussy....
<pingfloyd>	i don't need to tell you most guys' reactions
<butt3rfly>	lol
<pingfloyd>	some get excited over a hole in a fence ffs
<pingfloyd>	aliens has a lot of references to both genitalia
<duckgoose>	i like a good fence hole
<butt3rfly>	haha
<pingfloyd>	those xenomorphs were both phallic and phannic
<coldsparrow>	pingfloyd, have you ever seen any h.r. giger artwork? alot of it is sexual in nature
<coldsparrow>	my afvourite is the 'passagen' series.
<coldsparrow>	*favourite
<treefiddy_>	i thought i was a freak but you all is some phreaks up in here
<treefiddy_>	freaky deaky
<butt3rfly>	uh huh
<treefiddy_>	fuh rheak
<duckgoose>	shush freak
<treefiddy_>	haha
<treefiddy_>	takes one to know one
<duckgoose>	freak sounds like eek
<pingfloyd>	phreaking is hacking telecommunications
<duckgoose>	eek the cat
<duckgoose>	which was a good show :>
<treefiddy_>	eek
<coldsparrow>	sharky
<duckgoose>	i wrote a phreaking story
<treefiddy_>	pingfloyd: on a scale from sgt studanko to chong, how high are you right now?
<duckgoose>	http://www.haxed.net/post/analog_cellphone_hacking.html
<duckgoose>	:3
<treefiddy_>	2600
<enchilado>	is it "don't believe me! just watch" or "don't believe me? just watch!"?
<treefiddy_>	see video for proof
<pingfloyd>	not high enough for this channel
<treefiddy_>	well tune it up
<pingfloyd>	probably more like chong though, because i can only get so stoned.
<treefiddy_>	haha
<treefiddy_>	ncie
<pingfloyd>	he's a high functioning stoner
<treefiddy_>	yeah
<treefiddy_>	a lot of us are
<pingfloyd>	that's probably me
<treefiddy_>	i mean them
<treefiddy_>	youz guyz
<pingfloyd>	it's harder to think, but i still can, it just takes a little longer
<treefiddy_>	i dont think it's harder to think, you just dont give a fuck
<treefiddy_>	so you have to give one before you can think
<treefiddy_>	cause if you get on a topic you geek about
<treefiddy_>	you can really really think with minimul effort
<iphooey>	yo
<iphooey>	whatuppers
<treefiddy_>	word
<pingfloyd>	well, non-linear think
<pingfloyd>	isn't so hard
<pingfloyd>	but linear-thinking is a little more challenging while stoned
<treefiddy_>	yeah some types i guess
<treefiddy_>	like order of events?
<iphooey>	treefiddy_, pingfloyd i see you guys still hang out here? nice to see you, long time
<iphooey>	it's been at least 3 months

<iphooey>	what the hell is a superball
<treefiddy_>	iphooey: yeah, it's something like mav_laptop if he' around
<coldsparrow>	iphooey, rockets closed out the mavs tonight, so we'll play whoever wins spurs/clippers
<treefiddy_>	enchilado: i will watch a football game with a friend occasionally and the superbowl. but not much else

<hmir>	fuck!
<hmir>	my hands are too soft for work like that!
<hmir>	=\
<hmir>	i really need to mop my floor too. =\

<hmir>	will you go to he bar or avoid?
<hmir>	will you support your american man?
<hmir>	i think manny will get beat, but i hope he wins!

<hmir>	but disney don't do movies of their own
<hubik>	jobsy ran pixar though?
<hmir>	so disney is pizar
<hmir>	no?

<hubik>	hands on the table please walter
<hmir>	his wife can still make bank though.
<treefiddy_>	disney still make their own cartoons, not all of them are pixar
<idioterna>	yeah i dunno who owns what
<hmir>	i heard his wife basically broke up a marriage by sleeping with a married man.
<idioterna>	yeah and there's dreamworks
<hmir>	cesspool oif degeneracy! teehee!
<dovermo>	hmir, teehee

<hmir>	my pimp hand is strong.
<dovermo>	o:
<idioterna>	i didn't let my kids watch frozen until i heard the church says it's gay propaganda
<idioterna>	now they have to watch it every day

<jessicaj>	:p
<idioterna>	prove it
<dovermo>	arinooo mamadeee
<hmir>	my words are enough.
<idioterna>	only if bushes spontaneously combust when you speak
<idioterna>	and that has to happen consistently
<hmir>	only if i intend for them to do so.
<idioterna>	but you have to state it beforehand
<hmir>	i'll combust your bush

<idioterna>	iphooey: or the copyright would eventually expire
<doge>	gamma: i was typing on it and someone was watching me lol
<iphooey>	idioterna: which is weird, because he wasn't an atheist afaik... and this world nowadays has little to live for except your loved ones
<iphooey>	so why freeze oneself to life forever?
<idioterna>	dunno
<idioterna>	but i guess it's for the copyright
<idioterna>	also i don't know if he had any say in that
<sunstar>	people are afraid of death

<mkaminsky11>	hello
<h2o1>	'lo
<doge>	http://i.imgur.com/usv0lqj.png i think i need a better charger
<idioterna>	try turning on extreme power saving
<doge>	idioterna: but then i can't irc :<
<idioterna>	oh
<sud0>	morning
<lasdam>	i wonder/just realized potentially the importance of religion in moralizing ignorant people. and i don't mean that offensively or condescendingly -- my question is basically: does less contemplative, more impulsive and unthoughtful people, which i believe is, if not in majority, certainly in relatively large numbers, do they
<lasdam>	currently need something like religion, a forceful and metaphysical system threatening violence, to behave civilized/according to morality, as they don't understand the point with or/and acknowledge the authority and purpose of a self-regulating morality that doesn't _force_ you to submit to it?
<lasdam>	i've seen quite a few debates on atheism vs religion, but i've never heard this topic been brought up, even though it's the most convincing argument to my - not necessarily for religion specifically, but for atheism not necessarily working well out for ignorant people (and their environment) in the current state of the world.
<ceil>	tl;dr
<bazhang>	lasdam, ##religion not here
<lasdam>	##religion has 19 users. i checked. i'm not looking for ##religion anyway, i'm looking for ##debate or ##thoughtful-chat
<bazhang>	w/e not here
<ceil>	for putting yourself on an intellectual pedestal, you sure do have some horrific sentence structuring
<ceil>	just so you know
<equinoxdawg>	try a little bit of ##politics too, just for the fun of it.
<wowwhatamouthful>	same could be said of everyone on freenode, on sentence structuring
<ceil>	also, ##philosophy has 85ish users
<wowwhatamouthful>	at least he can spell
<lasdam>	i like to think and share thoughts = i put myself on an intellectual pedestal - sure thing. and yeah, i'm not schooled at all, and english is a secondary language.
<ceil>	wowwhatamouthful: i think my sentences tend to be quite well-structured : (
<bazhang>	just keep it out of here lasdam
<lasdam>	so what goes here, bazhang
<ceil>	lasdam: are run-on sentences and awkward phrasing a thing in your native tongue?
<wowwhatamouthful>	ceil :< we're not perfect
<ceil>	wowwhatamouthful: speak for yourself : p
<wowwhatamouthful>	ceil:  it could be a translation of grammar
<wowwhatamouthful>	perhaps grammar rules in his first language are different
<lasdam>	cell: i guess not, but when i spend less than a minute writing down/articulating more than 100 words that are at the same time supposed to address something specific and meaningful to me, then yea, sentence structure is obviously not a priority
<ceil>	perhaps he should takes some lessons from ##english before engaging in intellectual discourse using the language : p
<sud0>	hmir: stoopid hmir
<wowwhatamouthful>	i dont think we should discriminate against people who don't speak english as a native language
<wowwhatamouthful>	:p
<lasdam>	i should probably take lessons from grammarnazi.com, honestly
<wowwhatamouthful>	he speaks better than ost
<wowwhatamouthful>	most*
<ceil>	lasdam: concise communication - clarity in connection of collected cogitations - is critical
<ceil>	(just sayin')
<lasdam>	who could possible take my arguments and interest in a topic seriously if i don't articulate my sentences with perfect grammatical affluence?
<lasdam>	seems like a legit point
<wowwhatamouthful>	ok. tapping out
<sud0>	i swear i am really smart in spanish
<ceil>	wowwhatamouthful: i prefer to strive for perfection, rather than satisfy myself with being a head above the meagre musings of moronic mobs
<ceil>	i think that's enough alliteration for the hour <.<
<wowwhatamouthful>	so.. if i'm to understand what you're saying… the meagre musings of others are… beneath you...
<ceil>	wowwhatamouthful: nothing wrong with thinking you're better than everyone else, just so long as it's true : p
<wowwhatamouthful>	we still bleed, just the same.
<ceil>	(usually i'm quite modest, actually. i've just been piqued)
<wowwhatamouthful>	to each their own
<lasdam>	being honest about a topic = thinking you're better than everyone else?
<hmir>	so tired. i could go right back to sleep.
<ceil>	lasdam: bothering to learn and implement proper spelling and grammar makes those that make such a decision better than those that don't, in my hardly-humble opinion
<ceil>	(not a direct stab at you, by the way - your ramblings were at least legible, and your spelling is good)
<lasdam>	how was that an answer to my question?
<ceil>	hmir: but then how would you troll people on the internet?
<jelly>	lasdam: s/possible/possibly/
<idioterna>	oh we can troll ourselves
<idioterna>	no need to worry
<ceil>	: )
<lasdam>	certainly seems like it lol
<jelly>	lasdam: gotta work on the speling affluence as well!
<ceil>	spelling*
<wowwhatamouthful>	and to me, being nice in general holds much more weight than being unnecessarily obnoxious
<lasdam>	jelly: it's spelled affluence...
<wowwhatamouthful>	immho
<ceil>	(normally i ignore typos, but i couldn't overlook that one : )
<ceil>	wowwhatamouthful: politeness is often overrated
<wowwhatamouthful>	so is being a dick
<wowwhatamouthful>	potayto potahto
<wowwhatamouthful>	lets leave it at that
<ceil>	i'd rather hold an intelligent conversation with an obnoxious asshole than be bleated at by some dipshit about jeebus
<lasdam>	you're probably right wowwhatamouthful, but i don't care about influence, i care about discussing the topics in the most objective/true/honest way possible
<jelly>	wowwhatamouthful: heave you read http://www.mit.edu/~jcb/tact.html
<wowwhatamouthful>	lasdam:  people don't want to talk about it, i recommend you move on
<lasdam>	wowwhatamouthful: i have? i was answering directly to what you just said.
<wowwhatamouthful>	although sidenote: i'm inclined to agree with you
<wowwhatamouthful>	i know sweetie, no worries
<lasdam>	doesn't sound like you know, when you just told me to move on
<wowwhatamouthful>	ooookay
<wowwhatamouthful>	move on to another channel, another topic, i dunno. you still had to mention it. (just sayin')
<lasdam>	you both know i've moved on but you also have to tell me to move on at the same time?
<ceil>	jelly: fascinating essay
<ceil>	i'm such a nerd :<
<wowwhatamouthful>	moving on.
<ceil>	lasdam: i haven't told you to move on : p
<lasdam>	i guess you were talking to yourself "i have to move on and stop talking about the conversation style of lasdam"
<lasdam>	cell: was i talking to you tho?
<wowwhatamouthful>	oookay. really tapping out now
<idioterna>	ceil: having a polite conversation about astrophysics is actually really easy
<ceil>	lasdam: that third letter is a lowercase i, fyi
<ceil>	(i only bring this up because there used to be a user with the 'cell' moniker here, and i'm not sure whether or not they're still around)
<lasdam>	ceil: fascinating. tell me more
<ceil>	i did : )
<lasdam>	ceil: no man. more.
<ceil>	'cell' is also the name of one of the major villians in the dragonball z series : )
<lasdam>	fascinating. do go on
<fluffyxvi>	hi everyone
<idioterna>	i thought ceil stands for ceiling
<ceil>	'ceil' is a gaelic spelling; it sounds roughly like 'kel'
<fluffyxvi>	oog
<ceil>	i first adopted the pseudonym my sophomore year in high school, two years before i ever joined an irc network
<fluffyxvi>	*ooh intresting
<fluffyxvi>	i hate phones :p
<ceil>	should i still go on, or is this even tedious beyond your glib proddings? : )
<fluffyxvi>	its interesting me, please continue ceil
<idioterna>	kel?
<idioterna>	i remember watching "the secret of kells"
<idioterna>	it was full of gaelic sounding stuff
<ceil>	as in the ancient text?
<ceil>	neat
<idioterna>	it's an animated feature
<idioterna>	i heartily recommend it
<lasdam>	thanks, i have an idea of what's talked about here now. i see why you were offended by me addressing "ignorant" people in such a straight-forward manner too, it all makes sense, thanks.
<idioterna>	beautiful graphics
<ceil>	lasers: i take no offence at being deemed ignorant - the wise man knows that he knows nothing. where you fucked up was acting like religion makes one a better person
<ceil>	welcome to 2015
<equinoxdawg>	don't be mean to lasers
<fluffyxvi>	what time is it for you all, its 10.47 wedsenday night here.
<ceil>	idioterna: sounds kinda like a reimagining of the neverending story
<ceil>	fluffyxvi: 0749
<ceil>	equinoxdawg: lasdam* rage-quit : (
<ceil>	i really should stop hiding part messages
<fluffyxvi>	ah, you're up pretty early then.
<ceil>	fluffyxvi: i work nights. i'm actually quite exhausted
<idioterna>	ceil: uh, hm
<idioterna>	maybe
<ceil>	(hence my verbosity - i tend to talk more when i'm tired)
<ceil>	idioterna: kid in danger loses himself in a book, makes some anthro friends?
<idioterna>	no no
<idioterna>	i mean
<idioterna>	it's a little different here
<idioterna>	it's very old and i don't think the story is supposed to be modern
<ceil>	2009 is 'very old'? :<
<ceil>	or you mean the setting?
<idioterna>	yeah the story
<ceil>	kells weren't exactly a modern people :p
<ceil>	i'm sure i'll get around to watching it eventually
<ceil>	i still need to watch days of future past, prometheus, and dune :<
<idioterna>	dune?
<idioterna>	the 80s one?
<ceil>	yeah, i'm wondering if it's as bad as i remember
<idioterna>	oh it is, but it's also brilliant
<ceil>	lol
<ceil>	i couldn't put the book down, but i remember being quite sorely disappointed with the film
<idioterna>	oh
<ceil>	even though it's got patrick stewart in it iirc
<idioterna>	yeah i don't think the film was even meant to do justice to the book
<ceil>	who i adore as an actor
<idioterna>	yeah it does
<idioterna>	and as a person
<idioterna>	he's amazing
<ceil>	i don't know much about his off-screen life
<idioterna>	he's very active in campaigning against domestic violence
<ceil>	neat
<idioterna>	this is beautiful
<idioterna>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqfaivnuy1k
<idioterna>	what i wanted to say was, dune is visual art
<idioterna>	like trier's europa
<idioterna>	or in its way jarmusch's dead man or limits of control
<idioterna>	i'd say they're films you're supposed to more hallucinate than watch
<ceil>	heh
<idioterna>	understanding what they're about is only half of what they're about
<notsmirks>	the moses school rap
<hmir>	smirk for me now!
<notsmirks>	no

<notsmirks>	it was a lucky shot
<sud0>	...
<sud0>	someone please ban this guy
<notsmirks>	??
<sud0>	so was someone attempting a photoshop? in a rainy day?, full of lightning shit?
<sud0>	and he also got lucky with an amazing shot?
<romance>	some thing cant be photoshopped sud0 , you have to believe something do happen in reality. i had a picture of lightning in my bedroom
<romance>	it scared me
<idioterna>	it's easy to photograph lightning in such low light
<idioterna>	https://bou.si/pic/nice-discharge.jpg
<idioterna>	just leave the shutter open for a while
<sud0>	now add a sportcar and some lame filters
<hmir>	don't be so negative sud0!
<doge>	https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/348zcf/pulled_over_to_take_a_pic_of_a_lightning_storm/cqsl104

<hmir>	and i have to go on my run now, so i'm kind of uncertain...
<equinoxdawg>	does it make you feel special inside saying that hmir
<hmir>	everything i say makes me feel special. is that a trick question?
<equinoxdawg>	i specifically said on the inside, if you feel special on the outside too you should get that checked.
<hmir>	the inside was implicit. so was the outisde.

<y0wza>	luv potion number 5
<rexrat>	i usually drink a $1 mixed juice of pomegranate, apple, pineapple.
<notsmirks>	rexrat there was a woman who was addicted to coke like alcohol
<notsmirks>	if she stopped drinking it she displayed withdrawl symptoms
<notsmirks>	she died from it eventually
<rexrat>	and i sometimes go for sugarcane juice. just $0.50. it's like yeah, that's it. i'm healthy now. cocacola can go suck itself.
<y0wza>	ah but cocacola cant
<y0wza>	some1 gotta
<ceil>	tyl coca-cola has a version of their drink made with cane sugar and stevia

<deithrian>	ms sure seems to offer a lot of stuff for free these days o-o
<time-warp>	nm not done yet

<time-warp>	lol
<deithrian>	fuck gates, if i had that much money i would be changing the world not sitting on my ass in a "futuristic house"
<rexrat>	yeah, microsoft is open sourcing their closed source projects now.
<time-warp>	deithrian: lol
<rexrat>	i remember .net receiving glorious welcome in github.
<rymate1234>	this is real exciting shit
<time-warp>	rexrat: :d
<rexrat>	'tis.
<time-warp>	ok brb updatedb and shutdown -r now
<time-warp>	yay
<time-warp>	ok guys i just want to let you know i just encounterd the worlds most annonying person in starbucks
<time-warp>	he finaly left lol
<clarjon1>	lies, i was not at starbucks at all today.
<rexrat>	:d
<time-warp>	lmao clarjon1
<rexrat>	ever used this command? "mv /home/yourhomedirectory/* /dev/null"
<diogenese>	they may be organized. be careful.
<time-warp>	lol
<rexrat>	do not use it!
<time-warp>	ln -s /home/rexrat/pr0nstash /home/mom/workfolder
<rexrat>	:d
<doge>	rexrat: why not $home? :p
<rexrat>	http://www.howtogeek.com/125157/8-deadly-commands-you-should-never-run-on-linux/
<time-warp>	lol
<clarjon1>	time-warp: ehhh.
<clarjon1>	time-warp: nothing really would happen unless you made /home/rexrat/pr0nstash world-readable first.
<rexrat>	i see.
<clarjon1>	otherwise mom would just get a permission denied error when trying to open the work folder.
<deithrian>	i had my entire desktop removed in front of my eyes some years ago by issuing this command sudo apt-get install p11-kit:i386
<time-warp>	lol
<clarjon1>	deithrian: you had it removed in front of your eyes after skipping over reading the large list of packages it said it was gonna remove.
<clarjon1>	been there, done that.
<rexrat>	#rp
<rexrat>	#rip
<rexrat>	i had mine wiped out a few times.
<deithrian>	clarjon1, who reads those things lol
<clarjon1>	people who don't want their desktop uninstalled.
<deithrian>	no installation process should remove your entire system
<clarjon1>	it happens if other packages it depends on are too old
<clarjon1>	and dependencies are setup weirdly
<deithrian>	there's only one kind of software that does that on windows :d
<rexrat>	linux is pretty pain in the arse for new users.
<clarjon1>	the correct way to deal with it is to update the packages that it's wanting to remove
<time-warp>	rm -frv /home/windows/system32
<rexrat>	i mean they'll make it cluttered with random packages and hazardous tweaks they find elsewhere.
<clarjon1>	rexrat: i did that with my first linux.
<time-warp>	lol rexrat
<clarjon1>	i compiled my first program within a month of using it
<clarjon1>	it was a screensaver, haha
<rexrat>	happened with me for a dozen times.
<rexrat>	in ubuntu.
<rexrat>	i would install a package and then the screen goes blank, and other nightmares.
<deithrian>	lolol
<sabotender>	you know, its difficult to find a bug when you want one
<sabotender>	i need to feed my venus flytrap
<rexrat>	i was then determined to understand every piece of code in the kernel.
<clarjon1>	install all the things!
<clarjon1>	rexrat: install all the things, try out all the free softwares!
<time-warp>	notsmirks: are you ever going to move from south dakota
<notsmirks>	sabotender i can help with that
<deithrian>	update graphics driver = black screen after reboot, windows at least falls back to default ms vga drivers o-o
<notsmirks>	time-warp when i get older, yes. to canada.
<rexrat>	yeah.
<time-warp>	canada dry
<notsmirks>	as of right now though, south dakota is a nice place to live.
<time-warp>	ftw
<clarjon1>	\o/
<sabotender>	canada dry? thats a ginger drink
<time-warp>	:d
<clarjon1>	:d
<time-warp>	lol sabotender
<clarjon1>	hey be careful when using the word ginger.
<clarjon1>	you do know what it's an anagram for.. right?
<sabotender>	i cant take the bubbles, but i love ginger. a lot.
<notsmirks>	not a lot of bustling cities in this state which is what i like
<sabotender>	clarjon1: someone with red hair. sometimes it can be offensive
<time-warp>	lol
<clarjon1>	sabotender: it's anagram is also offensive.
<sabotender>	depending on how it is used
<time-warp>	if your a ginger please say i in the room
<sabotender>	but ginger is also a plant
<time-warp>	ahhhhhh happy plant :d
<clarjon1>	sabotender: you do know what an anagram is, right?
<quatsz>	hello~
<quatsz>	hello~
<quatsz>	hello~
<quatsz>	hello~
<quatsz>	hello~
<notsmirks>	i eat stuff
<quatsz>	hello~
<sabotender>	and besides its scientific name, there's no other word for it, and im not going to use a language i am unaccustomed to
<clarjon1>	goodbye.
<clarjon1>	lol
<rexrat>	2.3.6 gingerbread. my first android version. o_o
<time-warp>	clarjon1: whats a anagram
<notsmirks>	r.i.p. quatsz, shot by freenode admins
<clarjon1>	sabotender: an anagram is when you rearrange the letters of a word or phrase to make another word or phrase.
<sabotender>	clarjon1: its really not important since people know i am talking about the plant.
<sabotender>	i know what an anagram is
<time-warp>	lol
<clarjon1>	that's nice you're talking about the plant.
<clarjon1>	http://anagram-solver.net/ginger
<time-warp>	ahhhhh ginger plant :d
<sabotender>	just like the water bottling company evian spells 'naive' when you flip it around. i need to reset the irc, brb

<notsmirks>	hnng
<notsmirks>	ill go take a nap now
<clarjon1>	notsmirks: yes. that is why i was saying be careful with ginger's anagrams.
<diogenese>	switch hats. disguise yourself.
<time-warp>	diogenese: ill take a picture of the starbucks cam

<deithrian>	rexrat, some guy who made a "donation" site presenting it on the ms build lol they haz the algorithm that can figure out what you care about and what you would be more likely to donate to oh too funny
<rexrat>	are you...are you accusing me of..?
<sabotender>	i think its time to make an actual breakfast this morning; there's some turkey bacon that needs to be made. it is at the point of no return as far as going sour. if i dont eat it now, i'll have to chuck it, and i hate wasting food

<butt3rfly>	gosh, moving house must be so exhausting for you right now, i am well thanks :)
<butt3rfly>	i guess the 'nesting' feeling is helping with the unpacking?
<treefiddy_>	uh oh, is your monkey bad? spank it
<klixa-cloud>	butt3rfly: i'm not a nester
<klixa-cloud>	i'm used to moving at least every 6 months
<butt3rfly>	neither am i unless i'm heavily pregnant, then i can't help it

<estr>	anyone know of some good speakers that you can use outside? nothing cheap like music angles
<estr>	doesn't need good bass, can use subwoofers

<butt3rfly>	:)
<klixa-cloud>	i'm having another girl so i'm good in clothes
<butt3rfly>	that makes things a lot easier
<butt3rfly>	personally, i found that having a second child was so much easier than the first time around
<butt3rfly>	and after the first year, they entertain eachother which helps a lot
<klixa-cloud>	my toddler is kinda a loner so she's super easy to deal with
