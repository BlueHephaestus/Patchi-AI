Apr 28 23:01:12 <caselogic>	decent. i've been constipated lately.
Apr 28 23:01:20 <caselogic>	i take alot of hydrocodone. and coffee
Apr 28 23:01:48 <duckgoose>	caselogic you'll wear big boy clothes in no time
Apr 28 23:01:49 <pingfloyd>	because we care so much about your bowel habits
Apr 28 23:01:56 <caselogic>	haha
Apr 28 23:02:15 <caselogic>	treefiddy_, you're jealous.
Apr 28 23:02:34 <treefiddy_>	i know :( i can't even wipe myself yet
Apr 28 23:02:42 <pingfloyd>	maybe you can put regularity on your resume now
Apr 28 23:03:46 <caselogic>	resume..what's that
Apr 28 23:03:51 <pingfloyd>	the tough part is deciding whether to put it under skills or achievements
Apr 28 23:04:36 <penguin1263>	using a pi as a web server looooool
Apr 28 23:05:47 <pingfloyd>	I'm sure it would work fine for low traffic
Apr 28 23:06:04 <caselogic>	skills.
Apr 28 23:06:10 <penguin1263>	OH MY GOD
Apr 28 23:06:18 <penguin1263>	AT&T's "U-Verse"

Apr 28 23:21:34 <totem>	anyone, please entertain me

Apr 28 23:27:45 <rexrat>	Yayyy! o_O
Apr 28 23:27:55 <nealshire>	subscription based home security is so overrated. A RasPi system could be made to call emergency people for a much lower price
Apr 28 23:32:24 <rexrat>	Yeah they're usually for rich people who cannot *afford to think* about security by themselves.
Apr 28 23:33:58 <rexrat>	So they usually go for the fresh TV ad that has a smiling and dancing family with a certain *blah blah complete home security system*.
Apr 28 23:35:04 <rexrat>	And they're the ones to get exploited by naughty guys later. Corporate softwares I tell. Uses Visual Basic and runs on Microsoft Windows.
Apr 28 23:36:52 *	jjs999jjs is now known as Guest86180
Apr 28 23:37:04 <rexrat>	So I was at this airport that had a BSOD screen on the flight notification board. Uses Windows. Even hospitals, telecommunications use XP still.

<treefiddy_>	bust in HAY! WUT U DOIN!?
<tortib>	treefiddy_, want to help me run for president?
<treefiddy_>	tortib: no
<rexrat>	Women being ready in 5 minutes and men coming home in 5 minutes is the same.
<pingfloyd>	don't be a cock blocker
<tortib>	treefiddy_, why so harsh?
<rootsleep>	whats the difference between a woman and a computer ??? a computer doesnt fart when you insert a 3 1/2 inch floppy
<Atom138>	You wont make a girl cum without going to town on her clit with your mouth
<treefiddy_>	tortib: you asked me if i wanted to. i said no haha
<treefiddy_>	tortib: no harshness,. i just dont want to
<Atom138>	You CAN but it requires more than know how
<tortib>	treefiddy_, You don't think I would be a good president?
<swift110-phone>	Lol
<treefiddy_>	tortib: idk, prolly. im anti-politics.
<Atom138>	Nobody would be a good president
<Atom138>	Because thats not what is the problem
<tortib>	I'm the unoffical president of the internet

<Atom138>	ammend the international acl
*	tortib claims victory over the internet once again
<swift110-phone>	Ok
<tortib>	Atom138, I think it would be fair to allow internets to flow freely to all members of earth.
<Atom138>	preach
<tortib>	We are all in this together, internets should be made available to everyone, at a reasonable cost with the ability to perform reasonable actions on the internets.
<idioterna>	hi
<idioterna>	Atom138: that's not true
<swift110-phone>	Ok
<swift110-phone>	Hey tortib

<sunstar>	whordiots
<Atom138>	You can get Ocular herpes
<Atom138>	So im guessing if you can get in your eyes then you can give it with your eyes
<tortib>	I want revenge sooooo bad
<tortib>	So bad I can taste it
<Atom138>	for what
<idioterna>	revenge doesn't work
<idioterna>	get over it
<tortib>	idioterna, how does it not work?
<Atom138>	did you get chlamydia or something?
<pingfloyd>	Khan!!!
<tortib>	Atom138, thankfully no
<Atom138>	The clap?
<tortib>	naw
<Atom138>	then what
<tortib>	Just a lot of distress
<idioterna>	tortib: doesn't do anything
<idioterna>	don't get even, get odd!
<tortib>	idioterna, yeah I know that's why I'm going to try a different approach
<Atom138>	dox on 4chan
<idioterna>	tortib: let me show you something
<vodkode>	eh take the shots and get over it, its no big deal
<tortib>	I'm going to see how it pans out or if it even materializes
<idioterna>	tortib: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpDAk1Z0dZA
<swift110-phone>	S' is "v"f:;jlol
<vodkode>	if you screw around enough your bound to catch something
<tortib>	idioterna, lol princess bride
<idioterna>	yeah
<idioterna>	it's full of serious wisdom
<idioterna>	anyway, when you find the people you're about to take revenge on remember to say
<idioterna>	"hello,"
<idioterna>	you know the rest i presume
<tortib>	heheh
<rootsleep>	Atom138 isnt 4chan for pedos ?? :/
<tortib>	idioterna, have to wait to see what happens though, not sure who I can trust at the moment.
<idioterna>	i don't think you can trust anyone, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't
<tortib>	well, I know I have more enemies than friends
<idioterna>	that's normal
<idioterna>	there are few people anyone can describe as their friends
<tortib>	idioterna, if you cannot trust someone then why should I?
<idioterna>	do you have a choice?
<tortib>	Well not entirely
<idioterna>	it's how the universe works
<tortib>	Yeah, i'm just going to make sure I cover my basis prior to doing anything.
<idioterna>	you do your best to decide if you can trust someone
<pingfloyd>	you have to know how far you can trust each person
<idioterna>	but you can't know that
<idioterna>	you either get shafted or they earn a little more trust
<pingfloyd>	that's where intuition comes in
<tortib>	By the time you know how far you can trust someone, it's already too late because they broke that trust in order for you to actually be able to recognize what they can and can't be trusted with.
<idioterna>	yes, exactly
<pingfloyd>	some people don't have much of it, some do
<idioterna>	but with time you get better
<idioterna>	and because of this you have fewer friends
<idioterna>	but better ones
<idioterna>	usually.
<tortib>	Well, I don't even know which people in my life are my friends.
<rootsleep>	trust is an illusion
<tortib>	It's for sure not my parents.
<pingfloyd>	is there really even friends?
<tortib>	no
<tortib>	I don't think I have any actual friends
<pingfloyd>	or just allies?
<tortib>	pingfloyd, not even allies, but to a degree they are.
<pingfloyd>	allies at certain times
<tortib>	frienemies is the best way to describe them
<idioterna>	i have a couple of good friends
<pingfloyd>	usually by a common enemy
<pingfloyd>	the enemy of my enemy is my friend
<tortib>	pingfloyd, they are the common enemy
<idioterna>	but that means they can trust me and i won't let them down
<idioterna>	i can't account for their actions, merely my own
<pingfloyd>	in politics there is no trust, only forced hands
<Atom138>	4chan is for pedos as much as reddit is for bronies and zoofiliacs
<tortib>	Every single time I have tried to rely on a "friend" they have let me down.
<tortib>	Every time.
<Atom138>	not friends
<coldsparrow>	stop whining.
<idioterna>	tortib: that's not so rare
<vodkode>	tortib what are you mad about?
<idioterna>	tortib: and it also comes down to what you expect of your friends
<pingfloyd>	he wants revenge on Kirk for leaving him on Seti-Alpha 6
<tortib>	coldsparrow, if you would like to partake in this conversation I would recommend you input something that is actually constructive to the conversation except blurting out immature insults like a child.
<coldsparrow>	tortib, suck me
<tortib>	vodkode, I'm not angry about anything.
<tortib>	coldsparrow, no that's okay, you have your daddy to do that.
<vodkode>	I expect my friends to drink my beer, eat my food and attempt to scarf up my old computers
<vodkode>	tortib I mean like, what happened?
<vodkode>	What did your friend do to you, etc
<tortib>	too much stuff to name off man
<vodkode>	ok
<idioterna>	i find taking it easy and laughing at yourself works best
<sunstar>	anyone gonna watch the Pacquiao vs Mayweather fight?
<idioterna>	why would anyone watch a fight
<Noah`>	MasterSmarty
<vodkode>	Friends come and friends go, when you have money you have tons of friends, when you go broke they disappear, it is how it is
<vodkode>	The trick is to be very careful with who you call 'friend'
<idioterna>	well it's fairly easy
<rexrat>	I have no friends.
<rexrat>	Except for my family.
<idioterna>	friends are those you're prepared to give your life for
<diogenese>	I have a dog.
<idioterna>	but not those that would do the same for you
<Fowler>	That's a pretty extreme definition, idioterna
<rexrat>	But they're family, not friends. No they're friend too. A friend in need is a friend indeed.
<idioterna>	Fowler: sure
<vodkode>	I have a pet dog, my fiancee, some of her family and a couple guys I grew up with, thats it and I'm not shopping for anymore
<idioterna>	Fowler: and sometimes people do that for even a stranger
<idioterna>	so maybe sometimes even strangers can be friends
*	Noah` slaps MasterSmarty around a bit with a large trout
*	Noah` slaps MasterSmarty around a bit with Echo / Sound Test Service
<idioterna>	vodkode: i have a pet dog too
<idioterna>	i've had dogs all my life
<tortib>	diogenese, wooo dogs! :D
<diogenese>	:)
<idioterna>	bored them to death with my monologues
<idioterna>	but talking to a dog is a really good way of clearing your mind
<coldsparrow>	i like pulling my whiskers out.
<Fowler>	I've had dogs my whole life, too
<Fowler>	Except for the last two semesters
<Fowler>	And the next year
<Fowler>	Dorm life, no pets allowed
<coldsparrow>	Fowler, i've owned two dogs
<vodkode>	I have a dog and a cat, the cat is a friend too, but I'm also keenly aware if I was accidentally shrunken by an act of magic or such, she would eat me
<tortib>	how does someone actually become a friend though?  Wouldn't you have to technically befriend a strange?
<idioterna>	yeah cats are different
<idioterna>	we have four cats
<Fowler>	I've had lots of dogs
<idioterna>	tortib: yes
<tortib>	People are all strangers to each other, the only way to be friend them is actually speak with the person.
<idioterna>	tortib: it's easy when you have the resources
<Fowler>	Let's see . . . I mean, at least half a dozen
<tortib>	idioterna, of course.
<badon>	hi tortib
<tortib>	ayyy badon
<coldsparrow>	Fowler, do you ever get the feeling that this chatroom is full of clients belonging to the same guy having conversations with himself?
<vodkode>	I count my fiancee my best friend because when we met I was sick (with a tumor), 100% broke (sickness will do that to ya) and I looked like an obese albino that had rolled in rocksalt and got a bad haircut after
<Fowler>	I can only think of six with names
<Fowler>	coldsparrow: Nope
<tortib>	We're on IRC talking to each other behind a screen.  But I bet you none of you here would consider the other person a friend.
<Fowler>	Wait, seven!
<vodkode>	That lady not only financially supported me but took care of me for over a year of that shit, thats a friend
<idioterna>	vodkode: sounds about right
<idioterna>	vodkode: never let her down.
<Fowler>	tortib: I consider IRC collectively as a friend
<coldsparrow>	Fowler, did you ever have a corgi? those are the king of dogs
<tortib>	Fowler, so do I but there are also many enemies.
<tortib>	I have literally grown up on IRC
<Fowler>	Eh, I have no enemies on IRC
<Fowler>	tortib: Me too
<vodkode>	I won't
<Fowler>	IRC and message boards
<coldsparrow>	irc is just a way for me to occupy my hands and eyes
<coldsparrow>	i've been on irc for over 20 years
<Fowler>	The internet is basically a friend with an enormous breadth of interests and a fluid, completely dynamic personality
<tortib>	Fowler, you may not know if they are enemies yet or not...time can only tell.
<coldsparrow>	it aint as good as it was
<coldsparrow>	lol @ Fowler
<Fowler>	tortib: They aren't enemies right now
<tortib>	You may have enemies that you might not even know.
<Fowler>	No
<tortib>	But they might know you.
<Fowler>	I don't
<Fowler>	0% chance
<tortib>	How would you know if you didn't know?
<coldsparrow>	Fowler is a nice guy, he has no natural enemies.
<Fowler>	I've never had an enemy
<tortib>	Well you're doing something terribly wrong then.
<coldsparrow>	tortib, how ever, is a rotten little bastard who deserves to be shot.
<Fowler>	I don't have many interactions that could possibly spawn enemies
<tortib>	coldsparrow, wtf?
<pingfloyd>	that sounds optimistic
<tortib>	Why should I be shot?
<rexrat>	He who doesn't have an enemy doesn't have a friend either.
<Fowler>	rexrat: Shallow platitude
<coldsparrow>	tortib, because youa sk too many stupid questions.
<rexrat>	Fowler:  What's your latitude.
<coldsparrow>	*ask
<tortib>	coldsparrow, I see, what kind of questions have I asked that you deem stupid?
<coldsparrow>	that one.
<Fowler>	rexrat: I
<Fowler>	Uh
<tortib>	And it's stupid how exactly?
<Fowler>	I have no idea
<coldsparrow>	gfy
<rexrat>	Mine is 23.332 E - 36.2253 W
<idioterna>	Fowler: a time zone should suffice
<treefiddy_>	!! yess gfy
<Fowler>	rexrat: I don't know my latitude
<Fowler>	I don't even know my longitude
<Fowler>	I'm in Montana doe
<tortib>	coldsparrow, What I think is occurring is that you have nothing to say at all so you're stating that I ask stupid questions.
<rexrat>	Good luck using Google Maps.
<coldsparrow>	tortib, gfy
<tortib>	you as well coldsparrow
<idioterna>	so mountain time zone?
<Fowler>	idioterna: Probably
<Fowler>	An hour ahead of the west coast
*	coldsparrow blows tortib a kiss
<tortib>	coldsparrow, you're a very odd person.
<idioterna>	i'm in the mountains as well
<rexrat>	Yep.
<tortib>	coldsparrow, do you have some sort of love-hate relationship towards me?
<diogenese>	got mountains here too.
<idioterna>	but central european time
<Fowler>	idioterna: I'm amongst mountains, but I'm in a valley
<idioterna>	oh
<idioterna>	yeah, that'd be more correct
<Fowler>	I can't imagine living somewhere without mountains nearby and in view, though
<rexrat>	How long have you guys known each other tortib coldsparrow ?
<tortib>	rexrat, not very long at all
<idioterna>	yeah it gets weird on flat land
<tortib>	I have no idea who that person is.
<Fowler>	idioterna: Mountains and trees
<rexrat>	How long? In days.
<diogenese>	I don't like flat land much.
<idioterna>	Fowler: https://bou.si/pic/batch/spring-saturday
<idioterna>	like this
<Fowler>	I like flat land, but I like mountains at least nearby
<coldsparrow>	rexrat, eat me
<Fowler>	So I can see them and sometimes walk on them
<Fowler>	This town is really flat, though, which is nice for walking and such
<rexrat>	So why are you guys too involved then>
<Fowler>	With mountains very close
<Fowler>	idioterna: Yes
<Fowler>	That's very nice
<tortib>	rexrat, I don't know they just jumped my shit all of a sudden stating that I ask stupid questions...
<Fowler>	idioterna: https://www.flickr.com/photos/29682929@N08/15255196447/
<Fowler>	That's a hike I went on about 10 miles away from where I live
<hmir_d>	Smoochies!
<tortib>	rexrat, I first saw their name a day ago, I have been conversing with them for about a total of 30min (and that's being generous with time).
<idioterna>	Fowler: nice, that's way higher than where i am
<rexrat>	Oh, that's interesting.
<Fowler>	idioterna: This town is at like a mile above sea level
<idioterna>	i'd have to go about 30 miles to get to the mountains
<Mmango>	eiooooo
<Equinoxdawg>	tortib: he comes here with a bunch of different nicks. Caselogic, redsparrow etc
<idioterna>	Fowler: https://bou.si/pic/batch/alpe
<Fowler>	idioterna: Yeah, I'm only about 10 minutes out, it's real nice. Back home in Washington was about the same living near Seattle
<Fowler>	30-40 mins to the foothills
<Fowler>	The same as you, I mean
<idioterna>	well i have a bicycle so that's about two hours for me :)
<Fowler>	2-3 hours drive to real mountains back home
<Fowler>	This was taken from my dad's property: https://www.flickr.com/photos/29682929@N08/14315995537/
<idioterna>	do you ski?
<Fowler>	Nope
<idioterna>	me neither
<idioterna>	i used to ski a lot but just can't find the time since i got kids
<Noah`>	who thinks MasterSmarty should register on freenode so he can talk in here?
<Fowler>	That mountain is like an hour from my dad's place and my dad's place is like 90 mins from where I lived in Washington
<idioterna>	now i just cycle a lot
<Fowler>	So 2-3 hours to the biggest mountain in the lower 48
<rexrat>	So that 2 hours and 30 minutes.
<rexrat>	Wow I'm really smart. :P
<idioterna>	yeah
<Fowler>	rexrat: A+
<Fowler>	Also a sticker
<rexrat>	Thanks.
*	Fowler gives rexrat a gold star
<rexrat>	Lollipop too.
<Fowler>	NO
<Fowler>	I'M NOT A DOCTOR AND YOU DIDN'T GET A SHOT
<rexrat>	Yess!!!!!
<Fowler>	You have to get a shot if you want a lollipop
<rexrat>	Oops I forgot it's not the dentist.
<rexrat>	Glitch while channeling childhood memories into chat
<Fowler>	idioterna: I miss living in Washington :(
<Fowler>	Washington state is the best state imo
<Fowler>	Nature wise
<hmir_d>	nope!
<idioterna>	my CEO lives in seattle
<hmir_d>	Canada!
<hmir_d>	<.<
<idioterna>	oh
<idioterna>	well yeah
<idioterna>	i loved banff
<idioterna>	hehe
<Fowler>	So much variety of landscape in such a small area. Rainforest and beaches, a sea, tons of islands to explore, temperate forest, mountain tundra, desert steppes, canyons and gorges
<Atom138>	Derby weekend is set to be gorgeous i have a social event boner
<Fowler>	You could see all of those in one day in Washington
<idioterna>	Fowler: yeah, i live in slovenia so
<vodkode>	what is the rain like though Fowler
<idioterna>	Fowler: we're having almost all that
<idioterna>	there's not much coast
<Fowler>	vodkode: It rains a lot but it doesn't rain hard very often at all, and the spring and summer are real nice
<vodkode>	I live in Florida, its 365 days a year of warmth and about 300 of sunshine, there are a lot of hillbillies but its not that bad
<Fowler>	Fall and winter is a lot of overcast and light rain, which personally I love
<Fowler>	And every season is mild
<Fowler>	Barely gets below freezing in the winter, barely gets above 80 in the summer
<Atom138>	florida has rain every day
<Atom138>	4pm
<Fowler>	There's really more drizzle than rain in Washington for the most part
<Fowler>	A lot of places on the East coast get rain less frequently, but when it rains it fucking pours
<Fowler>	And the overall precipitation is about the same
<Fowler>	I prefer the drizzle
<treefiddy_>	what's the shizzle dizzle?
<joze>	east coast drizzle fo shore
<vodkode>	Atom138 depends where you live
<vodkode>	really does
<Fowler>	idioterna: https://www.flickr.com/photos/29682929@N08/14810218850/
<Fowler>	https://www.flickr.com/photos/29682929@N08/14810119080/
<vodkode>	huge state, 7 different climate zones
<Fowler>	That part of Washington is beautiful
<vodkode>	Miami, yep, every day
<Fowler>	I love visiting Eastern Washington'
<Fowler>	Just wouldn't want to live there
<Butt3rfly>	morning
<vodkode>	Where I am, small town, Inverness, north of tampa, its dry, almost arid, cactus grows here
<Fowler>	A lot of Eastern Washington is dry and arid, but no cacti afaik
<Fowler>	Just a lot of sage and shrubs and such
<Fowler>	sagebrush*
<Atom138>	orlando too
<Fowler>	Driving over the cascades is so cool. Dense forest on one side, desert on the other
<Fowler>	Dat rainshadow
<tortib>	I need gud gaem to play
<Atom138>	me toop

<duckgoose>	Atom Ant
<Atom138>	yep
<tortib>	23:21:22  :[Atom138]:	playing heartstone now, my pc blows
<tortib>	I know there was a hidden meaning behind that
<bobita>	hi all
<tortib>	hi
<sunstar>	hi
<treefiddy_>	hai
<Butt3rfly>	I think I might organise a Maypole event next year
<tortib>	Illuminati Confirmed
<Butt3rfly>	I was looking for one to take my youngest kid to and I'm going to have to travel miles
<sunstar>	ooo yeah maypole!
<duckgoose>	 
<tortib>	gooseduck
<Butt3rfly>	it came up in discussion that our education system in the UK has totally destroyed community events like maypole dancing
<sunstar>	cuz its a pagan event
<duckgoose>	maypo9le dancing
<tallguy>	lol pagen huh
<duckgoose>	sounds awfully white to me
<tallguy>	pagan
<pingfloyd>	it would be okay if it were christian though
<pingfloyd>	the hypocrisy and melding of church and state
<Butt3rfly>	well I'm not religious, the only reason it interests me is at a 'community' level
<pingfloyd>	like it matters if it is pagan anyway
<tortib>	all women are religious
<pingfloyd>	most holidays are pagan in origin
<pingfloyd>	Christmas is based on Yule
<Butt3rfly>	everything is based on pagan holidays because pagans partied every day lol
<pingfloyd>	where do you think christmas trees came from?
<vodkode>	from jesus
<pingfloyd>	Christian celebrate pagan holidays, they're just too ignorant to realize it
<sunstar>	^
<Butt3rfly>	a real pagan has 4 celebrations every month
<sunstar>	you mention anything pagan and people get all weird
<vodkode>	Yeah, damn bigots
<vodkode>	Whats incredible if that you'll talk to someone who believes in <X> religion and if they hear of something like multiverse theory, panspermia, etc etc etc they will dismiss it as insane/paranoid thought
<duckgoose>	not buddists!
<pingfloyd>	that's because it doesn't fit into their belief
<Atom138>	Their entire reality is based off these things
<Atom138>	Youre asking someone to willingly and manually have ego death
<Atom138>	Its impossible
<vodkode>	Some buddhists are incredibly dogmatic, tibet was a veritable hell for the average person when it was a theocracy
<Atom138>	buddhism isnt even the same
<Atom138>	same with hindi
<pingfloyd>	buddhism is more of a philosophy
<pingfloyd>	and way of life
<Atom138>	yeah
<Atom138>	Its a perspective
<pingfloyd>	same with kung fu
<vodkode>	you have Theraveda, Mahayana and about 500 regions derivatives thereof broken down into many thousands of micro-regional traditions
<duckgoose>	religion: a pursuit or interest to which someone ascribes supreme importance.
<duckgoose>	>:[
<pingfloyd>	and the two go hand in hand if we're talking Chinese buddhism
<vodkode>	but your average westerner who picks up the sutras and decides its cool to wear beads calls themself a buddhist and people cue off that for an opinion of the ideology
<nullvalue>	good morning all
<pingfloyd>	vodkode: yeah, it's stupid
<vodkode>	its like getting ideas upon Japanese Samurai culture by watching Chris Farley in his moomoo smash up a hollywood set
<pingfloyd>	vodkode: if I were going to become a buddhist I'd at least join a Shaolin Monastery
<vodkode>	or at least learn what a shaolin monastery is
<nullvalue>	i like ninja's better than samuraI
<treefiddy_>	here comes stabby claus here comes stabby claus right down stabby claus lane!
<pingfloyd>	I would consider myself at that point a kung-fuist though
<vodkode>	Most of the books on Buddhism are second or even third hand information they were written by westerners who didn't even speak let alone read let alone visit the traditions they've adopted
<vodkode>	chef boyardi religion
<nullvalue>	i have mastered the arts of a ninja
<coldsparrow>	nah
<duckgoose>	vodkode are you a Buddhist
<vodkode>	No, not at all, I did however study theology
<Atom138>	nihilist
<coldsparrow>	buddhism is not a religion
<milkmaid>	Hey
<treefiddy_>	yesterday man, i was a nihilist, now today im just to fuggin bored
<pingfloyd>	nullvalue: ninjas aren't really that badass
<duckgoose>	‹duckgoose›  religion: a pursuit or interest to which someone ascribes supreme importance.
<duckgoose>	it is sucka
<nullvalue>	not my type of ninja's
<pingfloyd>	nullvalue: a shaolin monk would easily own one
<pingfloyd>	like ever heard of chi-gung?
<nullvalue>	glad no shoalin monks around so us ninja's pretty much kickass
<nullvalue>	yes i have
<pingfloyd>	some of the stuff in the movies is embellished, but that shit is real
<vodkode>	For me, what's been interesting to study have been the NDE's of the past 15 - 20 years
<nullvalue>	ping im good at making ninja weapons
<duckgoose>	vodkode you claim to know that "most of the books on Buddhism are second or even third hand information" but that would require your reading of most of the books
<duckgoose>	JS
<treefiddy_>	what color of ninja weapons?
<nullvalue>	not much a fan of buddism not tht i dont respect other religions
<vodkode>	Near death experiences are now so common worldwide because of technology for resuscitation becoming so widespread/cheap and effective that its leading to a gradual shift in the perception of consciousness amongst a fairly literate and sober group of scientists
<pingfloyd>	say you joined a shaolin monastery, what weapon would you specialize in?
<pingfloyd>	I'd probably go with broad swords
<Atom138>	daibo
<nullvalue>	treefiddy_: what?? do you have to colour code weapons, mines mostly steel
<nullvalue>	i prefer katana's
<vodkode>	duckgoose not really, not at all, when a guy with the last name Johnson writes a book purporting to be a Yogi I pretty well know its a crock of shit
<Atom138>	not shaolin
<treefiddy_>	nullvalue: you passed the test. you may proceed
<nullvalue>	heh
<treefiddy_>	hehe
<pingfloyd>	has to be shaolin
<duckgoose>	sounds like assumptions to me :>
<nullvalue>	im a swordsmith
<vodkode>	I have read many books on Buddhism, Zorastricism, Vedic Culture, Quabbalism and about a dozen other religious/spiritual and philosophical systems, its pretty straight forward, buddhism is a term thrown around like a dollar whore at a port of call in this country and numerous others
<nullvalue>	modern swordsmith
<coldsparrow>	vodkode, well that is aninteresting euphemism
<pingfloyd>	if you're going to learn Buddhism, go to the source
<vodkode>	Anyone who can memorize a handful of core concepts can then tack on anything else they wish, claim it to be buddhism and write a sham book and sell it for a buck, its done all the time here
<pingfloyd>	otherwise you're probably being mislead
<nullvalue>	pingfloyd: i recommend thailand
<sabotender>	moo 🐮
<sabotender>	pingfloyd: o/
<Atom138>	Its all mislead
<vodkode>	exactly pingfloyd
*	sabotender hugs pingfloyd 
<nullvalue>	they hardcore buddists
<pingfloyd>	I'd go to China myself
<sabotender>	greetings
<coldsparrow>	china doesnt understand the buddha, go to tibet
<sunstar>	we have a buddist temple here.   yuppies are trying to get it shut down.  the current compaint: their vast volumes of literature are a fire hazard
<vodkode>	there are valid books on every subject, it's just that buddhism is so confused with 'new ageism' here that its defacto assumed to be many things it is not
<nullvalue>	buddism could be practiced anywhere you just have to find the knowledge its not tht hard
<duckgoose>	vodkode by what you've said I assume you feel you have a deeper understanding of religion than the people that actually follow said religion
<coldsparrow>	i prefer samsara
<Atom138>	They are trying to adapt the ideology to modern times
<nullvalue>	they have boks and stuff tht outta help
<Atom138>	They are th only ones trying to
<nullvalue>	coldsparrow: dont u mean kamasutra
<nullvalue>	:P
<coldsparrow>	hur
<coldsparrow>	i dunno kamasutra
<vodkode>	duckgoose I have an understanding that buddhism does indeed exist and what it is, is not 'anything anyone decides' it is
<sabotender>	oh dear, what did I walk into
<nullvalue>	its a religion too
<coldsparrow>	tantric sex is good enough for me
<nullvalue>	sabotender: religeous talks
<nullvalue>	ok good for u coldsparrow
<duckgoose>	vodkode I'm talking about Christianity
<sabotender>	bazhang: unusual for you to still be opted. Did you recently kickban someone and forget to 'hide' yourself?
<nullvalue>	well bbl guys
<sabotender>	duck....duck....duck....GOOSE!
<nullvalue>	i have to have breakfast and go to work
<nullvalue>	see ya at work all
<treefiddy_>	sabotender: he's voice, he set himself +V
<nullvalue>	laterz ppl
<sabotender>	ah, I misread :-P
<sabotender>	voice and op look similar on this thing
<nullvalue>	./ mode ##chat +v treefiddy_
<treefiddy_>	i have plenty of that i dont need it here too haha
<tortib>	I am in 11 channels while connected to 3 networks. I have 0 o:lines, 2 ops, 0 halfops, and 1 voice with power over 11 individual users.
<duckgoose>	vodkode are you smarter than Christians
<duckgoose>	in your opinion
<vodkode>	No, nor do I purport to be, nor do I denigrate Christians whatsoever
<treefiddy_>	denigrate all religion
<duckgoose>	‹vodkode›  Whats incredible if that you'll talk to someone who believes in <X> religion and if they hear of something like multiverse theory, panspermia, etc etc etc they will dismiss it as insane/paranoid thought
<duckgoose>	but...
<vodkode>	If anything I respect their overall consistency
<sunstar>	prosetylizers
<sunstar>	the lot of ya!
<treefiddy_>	not i
<vodkode>	<X> as in <insert dogmatic religion> duckgoose
<vodkode>	not X as in Christian
<treefiddy_>	ive cast off my security blanket
<pingfloyd>	I respect some Christians I've known
<duckgoose>	vodkode you said you don't denigrate Christians whatsoever
<pingfloyd>	they practice what they preach, except they don't preach
<pingfloyd>	they're more of the mind lead by example
<tortib>	They don't practice either
<treefiddy_>	i used to
<treefiddy_>	but they're the ones that keep getting into congress
<treefiddy_>	and really fucking things up for the rest of us
<tortib>	indeed they are
<duckgoose>	I'm not a religious man but I'm also not one to tell people what to believe
<duckgoose>	or in this case what not to believe
<tortib>	Every single religious person I have met has not been a kind person
<pingfloyd>	I really don't care what people believe as long as they stay out of my way
<vodkode>	duckgoose, clearly you misunderstood my point there, my point was that many religious people - of all types - become hardend in their beliefs to the point of looking at those with other beliefs as insane/irrational when a objective eye would classify them both as equally irrational
<tortib>	Then again also people who are not religious are pretty crude as well.  I think people just suck in general.
<duckgoose>	it's one thing to talk about how silly a religion is but it's offensive to say all followers of "<X>" act in any particular way
<coldsparrow>	pingfloyd, cuz you're on the fast-track, right
<vodkode>	There is nothing rational about faith, it isn't supposed to be rational in the spiritual sense
<Butt3rfly>	I must say I am surprised that no-one jumped on the phalic symbolism of the maypole
<treefiddy_>	oh
<Butt3rfly>	you guys never cease to amaze me
<Butt3rfly>	lol
<treefiddy_>	oh baby
<treefiddy_>	jump on?
<Butt3rfly>	lol treefiddy_
<treefiddy_>	the phallus? :O
<pingfloyd>	I think women notice things like that more
<pingfloyd>	when you got one, it's so normalized
<pingfloyd>	but if something looks like a pussy....
<pingfloyd>	I don't need to tell you most guys' reactions
<Butt3rfly>	lol
<pingfloyd>	some get excited over a hole in a fence ffs
<pingfloyd>	Aliens has a lot of references to both genitalia
<duckgoose>	I like a good fence hole
<Butt3rfly>	haha
<pingfloyd>	those xenomorphs were both phallic and phannic
<coldsparrow>	pingfloyd, have you ever seen any h.r. giger artwork? alot of it is sexual in nature
<coldsparrow>	my afvourite is the 'passagen' series.
<coldsparrow>	*favourite
<treefiddy_>	i thought i was a freak but you all is some PHREAKS up in here
<treefiddy_>	freaky deaky
<Butt3rfly>	uh huh
<treefiddy_>	fuh rheak
<duckgoose>	shush freak
<treefiddy_>	haha
<treefiddy_>	takes one to know one
<duckgoose>	freak sounds like eek
<pingfloyd>	phreaking is hacking telecommunications
<duckgoose>	eek the cat
<duckgoose>	which was a good show :>
<treefiddy_>	eek
<coldsparrow>	sharky
<duckgoose>	I wrote a phreaking story
<treefiddy_>	pingfloyd: on a scale from sgt studanko to chong, how high are you right now?
<duckgoose>	http://www.haxed.net/post/analog_cellphone_hacking.html
<duckgoose>	:3
<treefiddy_>	2600
<enchilado>	Is it "don't believe me! just watch" or "don't believe me? just watch!"?
<treefiddy_>	see video for proof
<pingfloyd>	not high enough for this channel
<treefiddy_>	well tune it up
<pingfloyd>	probably more like Chong though, because I can only get so stoned.
<treefiddy_>	haha
<treefiddy_>	ncie
<pingfloyd>	he's a high functioning stoner
<treefiddy_>	yeah
<treefiddy_>	a lot of us are
<pingfloyd>	that's probably me
<treefiddy_>	i mean them
<treefiddy_>	youz guyz
<pingfloyd>	It's harder to think, but I still can, it just takes a little longer
<treefiddy_>	i dont think it's harder to think, you just dont give a fuck
<treefiddy_>	so you have to give one before you can think
<treefiddy_>	cause if you get on a topic you geek about
<treefiddy_>	you can really really think with minimul effort
<iPhooey>	yo
<iPhooey>	Whatuppers
<treefiddy_>	word
<pingfloyd>	well, non-linear think
<pingfloyd>	isn't so hard
<pingfloyd>	but linear-thinking is a little more challenging while stoned
<treefiddy_>	yeah some types i guess
<treefiddy_>	like order of events?
<iPhooey>	treefiddy_, pingfloyd I see you guys still hang out here? Nice to see you, long time
<iPhooey>	It's been at least 3 months

<iPhooey>	Anybody see the Clippers/Spurs game?

<hmir>	Will you go to he bar or avoid?
<hmir>	Will you support your american man?
<hmir>	I think Manny will get beat, but I hope he wins!
<hmir>	Manny is a weird filipino. He's basically spanish, and spaniards kept their genetic line pretty much pure by not really 'fraternizing' with the local populace.

<lasdam>	I wonder/just realized potentially the importance of religion in moralizing ignorant people. and I don't mean that offensively or condescendingly -- my question is basically: does less contemplative, more impulsive and unthoughtful people, which I believe is, if not in majority, certainly in relatively large numbers, do they
<lasdam>	currently need something like religion, a forceful and metaphysical system threatening violence, to behave civilized/according to morality, as they don't understand the point with or/and acknowledge the authority and purpose of a self-regulating morality that doesn't _force_ you to submit to it?
<lasdam>	I've seen quite a few debates on atheism vs religion, but I've never heard this topic been brought up, even though it's the most convincing argument to my - not necessarily for religion specifically, but for atheism not necessarily working well out for ignorant people (and their environment) in the current state of the world.
<ceil>	tl;dr
<bazhang>	lasdam, ##religion NOT here
<lasdam>	##religion has 19 users. I checked. I'm not looking for ##religion anyway, I'm looking for ##debate or ##thoughtful-chat
<bazhang>	w/e not here
<ceil>	for putting yourself on an intellectual pedestal, you sure do have some horrific sentence structuring
*	Omni is now known as Guest93855
<ceil>	just so you know
<Equinoxdawg>	try a little bit of ##politics too, just for the fun of it.
<wowwhatamouthful>	same could be said of everyone on freenode, on sentence structuring
<ceil>	also, ##philosophy has 85ish users
<wowwhatamouthful>	at least he can spell
<lasdam>	I like to think and share thoughts = I put myself on an intellectual pedestal - sure thing. and yeah, I'm not schooled at all, and English is a secondary language.
<ceil>	wowwhatamouthful: i think my sentences tend to be quite well-structured : (
<bazhang>	just keep it out of here lasdam
<lasdam>	so what goes here, bazhang
<ceil>	lasdam: are run-on sentences and awkward phrasing a thing in your native tongue?
<wowwhatamouthful>	ceil :< we're not perfect
<ceil>	wowwhatamouthful: speak for yourself : p
<wowwhatamouthful>	ceil:  it could be a translation of grammar
*	hmir_a farts
<wowwhatamouthful>	perhaps grammar rules in his first language are different
*	hmir_a is now known as hmir
*	wowwhatamouthful fans the room
<lasdam>	cell: I guess not, but when I spend less than a minute writing down/articulating more than 100 words that are at the same time supposed to address something specific and meaningful to me, then yea, sentence structure is obviously not a priority
<ceil>	perhaps he should takes some lessons from ##English before engaging in intellectual discourse using the language : p
<sud0>	hmir: stoopid hmir
<wowwhatamouthful>	I dont think we should discriminate against people who don't speak english as a native language
<wowwhatamouthful>	:P
<lasdam>	I should probably take lessons from grammarnazi.com, honestly
<wowwhatamouthful>	he speaks better than ost
<wowwhatamouthful>	most*
<ceil>	lasdam: concise communication - clarity in connection of collected cogitations - is critical
<ceil>	(just sayin')
<lasdam>	who could possible take my arguments and interest in a topic seriously if I don't articulate my sentences with perfect grammatical affluence?
<lasdam>	seems like a legit point
<wowwhatamouthful>	ok. tapping out
<sud0>	I swear I am really smart in spanish
<ceil>	wowwhatamouthful: i prefer to strive for perfection, rather than satisfy myself with being a head above the meagre musings of moronic mobs
<ceil>	i think that's enough alliteration for the hour <.<
<wowwhatamouthful>	so.. if i'm to understand what you're saying… the meagre musings of others are… beneath you...
<ceil>	wowwhatamouthful: nothing wrong with thinking you're better than everyone else, just so long as it's true : p
<wowwhatamouthful>	we still bleed, just the same.
<ceil>	(usually i'm quite modest, actually. i've just been piqued)
<wowwhatamouthful>	to each their own
<lasdam>	being honest about a topic = thinking you're better than everyone else?
<hmir>	So tired. I could go right back to sleep.
<ceil>	lasdam: bothering to learn and implement proper spelling and grammar makes those that make such a decision better than those that don't, in my hardly-humble opinion
<ceil>	(not a direct stab at you, by the way - your ramblings were at least legible, and your spelling is good)
<lasdam>	how was that an answer to my question?
<ceil>	hmir: but then how would you troll people on the internet?
<jelly>	lasdam: s/possible/possibly/
<idioterna>	oh we can troll ourselves
<idioterna>	no need to worry
<ceil>	: )
<lasdam>	certainly seems like it lol
<jelly>	lasdam: gotta work on the speling affluence as well!
<ceil>	spelling*
<wowwhatamouthful>	and to me, being nice in general holds much more weight than being unnecessarily obnoxious
<lasdam>	jelly: it's spelled affluence...
<wowwhatamouthful>	immho
<ceil>	(normally i ignore typos, but i couldn't overlook that one : )
<ceil>	wowwhatamouthful: politeness is often overrated
<wowwhatamouthful>	so is being a dick
<wowwhatamouthful>	potayto potahto
<wowwhatamouthful>	lets leave it at that
<ceil>	i'd rather hold an intelligent conversation with an obnoxious asshole than be bleated at by some dipshit about jeebus
<lasdam>	you're probably right wowwhatamouthful, but I don't care about influence, I care about discussing the topics in the most objective/true/honest way possible
<jelly>	wowwhatamouthful: heave you read http://www.mit.edu/~jcb/tact.html
<wowwhatamouthful>	lasdam:  people don't want to talk about it, i recommend you move on
<lasdam>	wowwhatamouthful: I have? I was answering directly to what you just said.
<wowwhatamouthful>	although sidenote: i'm inclined to agree with you
<wowwhatamouthful>	i know sweetie, no worries
<lasdam>	doesn't sound like you know, when you just told me to move on
<wowwhatamouthful>	ooookay
<wowwhatamouthful>	move on to another channel, another topic, i dunno. you still had to mention it. (just sayin')
<lasdam>	you both know I've moved on but you also have to tell me to move on at the same time?
<ceil>	jelly: fascinating essay
<ceil>	i'm such a nerd :<
<wowwhatamouthful>	moving on.
<ceil>	lasdam: i haven't told you to move on : p
<lasdam>	I guess you were talking to yourself "I have to move on and stop talking about the conversation style of lasdam"
<lasdam>	cell: was I talking to you tho?
<wowwhatamouthful>	oookay. really tapping out now
<idioterna>	ceil: having a polite conversation about astrophysics is actually really easy
<ceil>	lasdam: that third letter is a lowercase I, fyi
<ceil>	(i only bring this up because there used to be a user with the 'cell' moniker here, and i'm not sure whether or not they're still around)
<lasdam>	ceil: fascinating. tell me more
<ceil>	i did : )
<lasdam>	ceil: no man. more.
<ceil>	'Cell' is also the name of one of the major villians in the DragonBall Z series : )
<lasdam>	fascinating. do go on
<FluffyXVI>	Hi everyone
<idioterna>	i thought ceil stands for ceiling
<ceil>	'ceil' is a gaelic spelling; it sounds roughly like 'kel'
<FluffyXVI>	oog
<ceil>	i first adopted the pseudonym my sophomore year in high school, two years before i ever joined an IRC network
<FluffyXVI>	*Ooh intresting
<FluffyXVI>	I hate phones :p
<ceil>	should i still go on, or is this even tedious beyond your glib proddings? : )
<FluffyXVI>	its interesting me, please continue ceil
<idioterna>	kel?
<idioterna>	i remember watching "the secret of kells"
<idioterna>	it was full of gaelic sounding stuff
<ceil>	as in the ancient text?
<ceil>	neat
<idioterna>	it's an animated feature
<idioterna>	i heartily recommend it
<lasdam>	thanks, I have an idea of what's talked about here now. I see why you were offended by me addressing "ignorant" people in such a straight-forward manner too, it all makes sense, thanks.
<idioterna>	beautiful graphics
<ceil>	lasers: i take no offence at being deemed ignorant - the wise man knows that he knows nothing. where you fucked up was acting like religion makes one a better person

<ceil>	idioterna: kid in danger loses himself in a book, makes some anthro friends?
<idioterna>	no no
<idioterna>	i mean
<idioterna>	it's a little different here
<idioterna>	it's very old and i don't think the story is supposed to be modern
<ceil>	2009 is 'very old'? :<
<ceil>	or you mean the setting?
<idioterna>	yeah the story
<ceil>	Kells weren't exactly a modern people :p
<ceil>	i'm sure i'll get around to watching it eventually
<ceil>	i still need to watch Days of Future Past, Prometheus, and Dune :<
<idioterna>	dune?
<idioterna>	the 80s one?
<ceil>	yeah, i'm wondering if it's as bad as i remember
<idioterna>	oh it is, but it's also brilliant
<ceil>	lol
<ceil>	i couldn't put the book down, but i remember being quite sorely disappointed with the film
<idioterna>	oh
<ceil>	even though it's got Patrick Stewart in it iirc
<idioterna>	yeah i don't think the film was even meant to do justice to the book
<ceil>	who i adore as an actor
<idioterna>	yeah it does
<idioterna>	and as a person
<idioterna>	he's amazing
<ceil>	i don't know much about his off-screen life
<idioterna>	he's very active in campaigning against domestic violence
<ceil>	neat
<idioterna>	this is beautiful
<idioterna>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqFaiVNuy1k
<idioterna>	what i wanted to say was, dune is visual art
<idioterna>	like trier's europa
<idioterna>	or in its way jarmusch's dead man or limits of control
<idioterna>	i'd say they're films you're supposed to more hallucinate than watch
<ceil>	heh
<idioterna>	understanding what they're about is only half of what they're about

<Deithrian>	MS sure seems to offer a lot of stuff for free these days o-o
<Time-Warp>	nm not done yet

<Time-Warp>	Deithrian: after they made 3000000000 billion dollars its all cool now

<rexrat>	Yeah, Microsoft is open sourcing their closed source projects now.

<clarjon1>	Lies, I was not at starbucks at all today.
<rexrat>	:D
<Time-Warp>	LMAO CLARJON1
<rexrat>	Ever used this command? "mv /home/yourhomedirectory/* /dev/null"
<diogenese>	They may be organized. Be careful.
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<rexrat>	DO NOT USE IT!
<Time-Warp>	ln -s /home/rexrat/pr0nstash /home/mom/workfolder
<rexrat>	:D
<doge>	rexrat: why not $HOME? :p
<rexrat>	http://www.howtogeek.com/125157/8-deadly-commands-you-should-never-run-on-linux/
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<clarjon1>	Time-Warp: Ehhh.
<clarjon1>	Time-Warp: Nothing really would happen unless you made /home/rexrat/pr0nstash world-readable first.
<rexrat>	I see.
<clarjon1>	Otherwise mom would just get a permission denied error when trying to open the work folder.
<Deithrian>	I had my entire desktop removed in front of my eyes some years ago by issuing this command sudo apt-get install p11-kit:i386
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<clarjon1>	Deithrian: You had it removed in front of your eyes after skipping over reading the large list of packages it said it was gonna remove.
<clarjon1>	Been there, done that.
<rexrat>	#RP
<rexrat>	#RIP
<rexrat>	I had mine wiped out a few times.
<Deithrian>	clarjon1, who reads those things lol
<clarjon1>	People who don't want their desktop uninstalled.
<Deithrian>	no installation process should remove your entire system
<clarjon1>	It happens if other packages it depends on are too old
<clarjon1>	and dependencies are setup weirdly
<Deithrian>	There's only one kind of software that does that on Windows :D
<rexrat>	Linux is pretty pain in the arse for new users.
<clarjon1>	The correct way to deal with it is to update the packages that it's wanting to remove
<Time-Warp>	rm -frv /home/windows/system32
<rexrat>	I mean they'll make it cluttered with random packages and hazardous tweaks they find elsewhere.
<clarjon1>	rexrat: I did that with my first linux.
<Time-Warp>	LOL REXRAT
<clarjon1>	I compiled my first program within a month of using it
<clarjon1>	It was a screensaver, haha
<rexrat>	Happened with me for a DOZEN times.
<rexrat>	In Ubuntu.
<rexrat>	I would install a package and then the screen goes blank, and other nightmares.
<Deithrian>	lolol
<sabotender>	you know, its difficult to find a bug when you want one
<sabotender>	I need to feed my venus flytrap
<rexrat>	I was then determined to understand every piece of code in the kernel.
<clarjon1>	Install ALL the things!
<clarjon1>	rexrat: Install all the things, try out all the free softwares!
<Time-Warp>	NotSmirks: are you ever going to move from south dakota
<NotSmirks>	sabotender i can help with that
<Deithrian>	update graphics driver = black screen after reboot, windows at least falls back to default MS vga drivers o-o
<NotSmirks>	Time-Warp when i get older, yes. To canada.
<rexrat>	Yeah.
<Time-Warp>	canada dry
<NotSmirks>	As of right now though, south dakota is a nice place to live.
<Time-Warp>	FTW
<clarjon1>	\o/
<sabotender>	canada dry? thats a ginger drink
<Time-Warp>	:D
<clarjon1>	:D
<Time-Warp>	LOL SABOTENDER
<clarjon1>	hey be careful when using the word ginger.
<clarjon1>	You do know what it's an anagram for.. right?
<sabotender>	I cant take the bubbles, but I love ginger. A lot.
<NotSmirks>	Not a lot of bustling cities in this state which is what i like
<sabotender>	clarjon1: someone with red hair. Sometimes it can be offensive
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<clarjon1>	sabotender: It's anagram is also offensive.
<sabotender>	depending on how it is used
<Time-Warp>	IF YOUR A GINGER PLEASE SAY I IN THE ROOM
<sabotender>	but ginger is also a plant
<Time-Warp>	ahhhhhh happy plant :D

<clarjon1>	GOodbye.
<clarjon1>	lol
<rexrat>	2.3.6 Gingerbread. My first Android version. O_O
<Time-Warp>	clarjon1: whats a anagram
<NotSmirks>	R.I.P. Quatsz, shot by freenode admins
<clarjon1>	sabotender: An anagram is when you rearrange the letters of a word or phrase to make another word or phrase.
<sabotender>	clarjon1: its really not important since people KNOW i am talking about the plant.
<sabotender>	I know what an anagram is
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<clarjon1>	That's nice you're talking about the plant.
<clarjon1>	http://anagram-solver.net/ginger

<rexrat>	Are you...are you accusing me of..?
<sabotender>	I think its time to make an actual breakfast this morning; There's some turkey bacon that needs to be made. It is at the point of no return as far as going sour. If I dont eat it now, i'll have to chuck it, and I hate wasting food

<JessicaJ>	hey treefiddy_ btw
<Estr>	then $4 on cars and rest to host parties for the rest of my life
<QcMat>	500k on various cars
<Fowler>	If I had $15 million I'd waste $1 million on frivolous shit and then hire someone to invest the rest of it
<treefiddy_>	hey JessicaJ btw
<JessicaJ>	Fowler, dont forget the 40% on taxes
<Fowler>	Maybe like $500k on a house
<JessicaJ>	:)
<JessicaJ>	whats 40% of $15M
<Fowler>	6 mill
<QcMat>	500k in some areas is just a 2 room appartment
<coldsparrow>	the lottery is a scam
<Fowler>	QcMat: That's plenty
<Fowler>	I'm one person
<Fowler>	Two rooms is more than enough
<QcMat>	I need my trees and property
<QcMat>	grass, etc
<rootsleep>	i would suck balls for 15 mill
<Fowler>	QcMat: Then you don't buy a two bedroom apartment in the city
<coldsparrow>	yous uck balls for free
<QcMat>	if I had 15mil to blow i'd definitely get myself a huge property
<Fowler>	Which is when it'll cost $500k
<treefiddy_>	will you take a rain check?
<rootsleep>	coldsparrow: just 15 mil
<Fowler>	If you want property and nature you spend $500k on a house out in the wilderness somewhere
<Fowler>	With acres of land
<Estr>	Anyone got a good spotify playlist?
<Estr>	Party playlist
<QcMat>	subburbs with nice properties exist hehe
<bazhang>	if you cannot keep it safe for work, then dont say it at all
<Fowler>	And then you buy a helicopter to get places quickly
<JessicaJ>	and a pilot on call unless u know how to fly one
<Fowler>	Pfft, you don't have to work
<Fowler>	You can take some lessons in your free time
<Fowler>	Get that pilot's license real quick
<JessicaJ>	i dont think they give them out real quick
<QcMat>	and then fly under all 100 bridges
<JessicaJ>	lots of hours of practice
<QcMat>	like gta
<JessicaJ>	lol
<treefiddy_>	you have to log a certain number of hours yes
<Fowler>	JessicaJ: Way quicker than if you had to keep working
<QcMat>	respawn at hospital when you fail
<Fowler>	Which is what I meant
<treefiddy_>	but in the grand scheme of things it's quick
<Fowler>	You could do it full time
<JessicaJ>	Fowler, well.. yeah but still not quick :P
<Fowler>	Well
<Fowler>	Pretty quick
<JessicaJ>	lol treefiddy_ yeah
<Estr>	a pilot license costs like $250k +/-
<Estr>	Depends on where you take it
<QcMat>	im sure that depends on where
<QcMat>	haha you said it
<JessicaJ>	the grand scheme of things being around a 70 year life span average
<Fowler>	"According to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association's cost calculator, the cost for a private license runs on average $9,900, a recreational runs $7,700 and a sport license about $4,400."
<QcMat>	because I know 2 people with it they never paid 250k im certain
<Fowler>	Estr: Where'd you get $250k?
<QcMat>	maybe more like 15k
<JessicaJ>	ooo Fowler has done his research
<Estr>	Fowler, me?
<Estr>	I don't have a pilot license
<Fowler>	JessicaJ: That was a two second google search
<Fowler>	Estr: Where'd you get that number
<treefiddy_>	maybe a commercial pilots license costs that much
<Estr>	I know a few people who are pilots
<Fowler>	Commercial pilots?
<Estr>	I don't know what a commercial pilot is
<treefiddy_>	they fly jumbo jets for an airline
<JessicaJ>	they got ripped off then maybe :P
<Fowler>	A person who pilots commercial aircrafts
<Estr>	Oh, no
<treefiddy_>	not a cessna or something
<Fowler>	Estr: Well, it's definitely not $250k by default everywhere
<Fowler>	It's $10k on average
<Estr>	Just normal air plains and one of them is a pilot for a helicopter
<QcMat>	yeah I'm pretty sure it's 10-15k
<Fowler>	I know someone with a pilot's license
<Estr>	rofl, he said 1 million nok
<QcMat>	maybe @ 250k you keep the chopper? :)
<Fowler>	There is a zero percent chance they spent $250k
<Estr>	which according to google is.. (2 sec)
<JessicaJ>	lol QcMat
<treefiddy_>	250 would be cheap for a chopper
<Fowler>	Yeah
<JessicaJ>	its a discount .. 2fer1
<Estr>	Ok, $132
<Estr>	I missed by a lot
<Fowler>	Still
<Estr>	but still isn't close to yours
<JessicaJ>	like when you get your ears pierced for free if you buy a pair :P
<QcMat>	yeah more like /10
<Fowler>	There's no way the person I know spent $132k
<Fowler>	Zero percent chance
<QcMat>	me either the guys arent rich by any means
<QcMat>	probably some form of monthly payment plan
<Fowler>	Estr: What country?
<Estr>	Norway
<QcMat>	Canada here
<Fowler>	Oh, you said what currency it was
<Fowler>	Imdum
<Fowler>	Maybe it's just way, way more expensive there
<Estr>	But he took the license in us
<Fowler>	Like 13x as expensive
<JessicaJ>	bitcoins :P
<Fowler>	Estr: Well he did something that wasn't normal, then. The average cost in the US is under $10k
<JessicaJ>	they saw him coming
<Estr>	lol wtf
<Fowler>	http://www.touch-n-goes.com/private/privatepilotpricing.html
<H2O1>	a pilot license $$$ is a tax on employment
<Fowler>	That site breaks it down
<Estr>	It's norway though, you pay $16 for a burger king meal :?
<H2O1>	what do you pay in New York?
<Fowler>	Under $10
<H2O1>	and in smalltown?
<Fowler>	Probably like $9 for the more expensive meals
<Estr>	The more expensive meals could be like $19 here
<JessicaJ>	$6
<JessicaJ>	for regular places
<Fowler>	Estr: Yeah, well, at least you have good social services
<JessicaJ>	$6-8
<QcMat>	9-10$ in canada
<JessicaJ>	unless you order off the $1 menu :P
<Estr>	I wouldn't say our social service is better than anywhere else
<QcMat>	and our 1$ menu is the 2$ menu
<Fowler>	Estr: Definitely better than in the US
<Fowler>	As far as education and healthcare go
<ceil>	$4 for a spicy mcchicken, small fry, and a drink at McD's : )
<Estr>	Oh
<Estr>	yeah
<Estr>	I thought you meant our burger king service was better than yours LOL
<QcMat>	mcds in usa is so damn cheap
<Fowler>	You pay more in taxes but you get what you pay for
<QcMat>	here that would be 10$ easy
<JessicaJ>	lets all head over to mc d's then
<Fowler>	Estr: lolno
<Fowler>	Burger King has $1 rodeo crispy chickens, though
<Fowler>	The McDs here charges over $1 for a mcchicken
<Fowler>	It's almost $2
<QcMat>	mcchicken will be 5$, fry 3$, and coke 2$
<JessicaJ>	mmm BK
<treefiddy_>	Mmm
<Fowler>	I like Wendy's burgers the best, but BK has the best dollar menu right now
<treefiddy_>	burger king has a chicken big king
<treefiddy_>	best sandwich ever. 2 for fie dolla!
<JessicaJ>	wendys has a bacon cheeseburger for like $1.29 i think
<QcMat>	BK basically made a big mac too
<Fowler>	McChickens are better than the BK chicken sandwich, but the rodeo chicken sandwich has bbq sauce and onion rings
<QcMat>	they call it the big king? I think
<Fowler>	Which makes up for it
<treefiddy_>	QcMat: yea the big king
<treefiddy_>	QcMat: they have a chicken one that is to die for
*	YonicWitch_ is now known as YonicWitch
<QcMat>	they'll never equal the bigmac, they can never make it as cold
<JessicaJ>	hey YonicWitch (again)
<Fowler>	Back home in Washington McChickens are $1, though. Pretty sweet. You can roll through and get two mcchickens and a drink for $3, then smoke a bowl and eat it
<QcMat>	i've never seen a warm bigmac
<ceil>	weird, all the big macs i've had have been warm
<ceil>	maybe my local chains remember to turn on the heat lamps : p
<JessicaJ>	lol
<QcMat>	if you order custom you can get a warm one sometimes
<QcMat>	my mcds sucks
<JessicaJ>	extra mayo or something
<QcMat>	yeah
<JessicaJ>	sometimes lol
<Fowler>	ew
<ceil>	i just get it 'no veggies'
<JessicaJ>	open it up and put the extra on and then give it to them rather than make a new one
<JessicaJ>	but.. veggies...
<ceil>	and i know they don't just pull them off, cos there's no pickle impressions on the bun when i check : p
<QcMat>	yeah I want them
<JessicaJ>	you need your veggies
<Fowler>	I like veggies on burgers
<JessicaJ>	lol
<Fowler>	Don't want mayo unless it's very little
<QcMat>	veggy less mcds would be pretty meh
<JessicaJ>	pickle impressions lol
<ceil>	JJ, i drink soy milk, that's close enough : p
<QcMat>	I do extra pickles on bigmac, and I like it too
<Fowler>	I like pickle, onion, tomato, lettuc, and mustard
<Fowler>	On muh burgers
<QcMat>	but sometimes they'll put like 8 of them and ill dump some
<JessicaJ>	close enough for veggies ? LOL
<ceil>	Fowler: of those, i like mustard
<JessicaJ>	ceil, soy milk = extra estrogen
<JessicaJ>	soy yo
*	treefiddy_ rolls around in mustard
<JessicaJ>	lol
<Fowler>	wut
<treefiddy_>	i dont like soy milk
<Fowler>	treefiddy_
<ceil>	onions are tolerable when caramelised or battered and fried
<treefiddy_>	it's too gritty
<Fowler>	What are you doing
<ceil>	but raw chopped onions are just stupid D:
<Fowler>	Why are you rolling around in mustard
<treefiddy_>	Fowler: enjoying my day, what are you doing?
<QcMat>	mcds onions are dried up onions they add water too
<Fowler>	ceil: I like raw onions
<QcMat>	in some sandwiches it's real onions
<ceil>	Fowler: cos you have objectively bad taste
<ceil>	:p
<Fowler>	ceil: nou
<treefiddy_>	onions = flavor
<Fowler>	Raw red onion on burgers is so amazing
<n0lan>	yayyy i'm back :) thx @bazhang
<n0lan>	yo treefiddy_ wassup bromeo
<Fowler>	I also always put onions on tacos and hotdogs/sausages
<ceil>	treefiddy_: not raw
<treefiddy_>	heyas n0lan

<treefiddy_>	ceil: hells yesssssss
<Fowler>	Raw onions have great flavor
<Fowler>	And texture
<QcMat>	yeah they do
<JessicaJ>	hi n0lan
<ceil>	raw onions is just intolerable texture that tastes vaguely like grass
<QcMat>	I put a ton of onions everywhere
<ceil>	caramelised onions are sweet and nice
<QcMat>	at subway I always asked for more
<Fowler>	I mean, nothing against caramelized onions, but raw onions are dang tasty
<n0lan>	Fowler: I agree. I like the raw red (purple/bermuda) onions the best
<Fowler>	ceil: Raw onions are sweet, too
<Fowler>	Sweet and crisp with bite
<treefiddy_>	ceil i eat onions like an apple sometimes
<n0lan>	yeah they have a sweet taste
<JessicaJ>	QcMat, and keep mouthwash and mints on hand?
<ceil>	treefiddy_: because you're grody
<n0lan>	It's actually the umm
<n0lan>	It's the sugar in the onion that caramelises it
<JessicaJ>	lol
<treefiddy_>	ceil well yea
<QcMat>	JessicaJ I work at home my monitor can take it :)
<JessicaJ>	LOL
<Fowler>	n0lan: Red onion on burgers adds the perfect hint of sweetness and a bit of crispness
<Fowler>	I love 'em
<Fowler>	Same with sausages and tacos and such
<n0lan>	yeah i love the crispiness
<JessicaJ>	QcMat, no gf eh
<QcMat>	yes but she's upstairs she can take it
<Fowler>	Although I'll go with red or white or yellow on the tacos and sausages
<QcMat>	I only eat subway for lunch, when I got itme I dont eat that shit
<Fowler>	Only red on burgers doe
<QcMat>	I make real food then
*	n0lan had a really amazing date yesterday

<n0lan>	well I am upstairs.

*	MJ_Pharmer is now known as gassho
<ForexTraderNYC>	nowaay cute_korean_girl
<ForexTraderNYC>	i think they hav the best soap-operas
<pingfloyd>	that's how most soap operas are
*	ChanServ gives channel operator status to bazhang
*	bazhang sets ban on *!*@unaffiliated/gassho
*	ChanServ removes channel operator status from bazhang
<cute_korean_girl>	apparently he "is the founder and CEO of LockerGnome, Inc., a network of blogs, Web forums, mailing lists, and online communities"
<ForexTraderNYC>	they hav lot of twists n turns in stories
<ForexTraderNYC>	n variations
<cute_korean_girl>	right, and it's all the same twists and turns in every drama, and they're always cheap twists and turns because the writers are lazy
<ForexTraderNYC>	um i do hear that a lot..but i havent had chance to view them recently
<ForexTraderNYC>	but the stuff i watched i loved so far
<cute_korean_girl>	I have never heard of LockerGnome inc, but if that guy is running it it's all probably terrible
<ForexTraderNYC>	i hav a big crush on So ye Jin
<ForexTraderNYC>	she deserves ms. universe award
<pingfloyd>	To me Chris Pirillo represent all of the bad geek qualities
<d1etyd3vil>	Because he makes money??

<cute_korean_girl>	I didn't know he made money d1etyd3vil until about 30 seconds ago
<cute_korean_girl>	as I'm scrolling his wikipedia article
<pingfloyd>	what's money got to do with it?
<y0wza>	he been aroun forever
<cute_korean_girl>	but I basically agree with pingfloyd, and have absolutely hated him for years
<d1etyd3vil>	That's cause you're getting your facts from Wikipedia.
<cute_korean_girl>	basically since the boob incident and I just thought "holy crap, how can you get any nerdier"
<y0wza>	i thot he used to have an irc network but i 4get
<y0wza>	sum small shit
<cute_korean_girl>	no, d1etyd3vil... I... I didnt get it from wikipedia... that's what I'm saying
<pingfloyd>	did Leo Laporte replace him?
<y0wza>	for one of his web shows
<d1etyd3vil>	And that's what I'm saying to korean_girl
<d1etyd3vil>	too*
<d1etyd3vil>	Does anyone here play Tekken?
<tortib>	cute_korean_girl, I have the strangest feeling that you're really not a Korean girl.
<cute_korean_girl>	I liked Leo Laporte, he always seemed cool
<flipapy>	aw you dont like chris pirillo? i mean personally when i found out he married a hotness lady, i was thinking.... um geek trofy wife? thats a new one i guess... but i am not one to judge, if he wants to love a sexy attractive big breated caring woman... kudos to him, btw, thats what most of us men want as well...
<pingfloyd>	Leo was okay
<pingfloyd>	at least he had some class
<d1etyd3vil>	I don't like his content but he's an entreprenuer and doing things with his life so I will respect that.
<pingfloyd>	and knew how to not make an ass of himself and be oblivious about it
<cute_korean_girl>	who was that balding guy with him who kinda looked like a mouse?
<d1etyd3vil>	Also his face is weird
<cute_korean_girl>	I liked him

<uxfi>	haha
<tortib>	how the hell do you eat lays chips AND funyuns
<tortib>	did he put them both in one bag?
<tortib>	did he have two bags and was eating the chips out of each one ?
*	Tiger is now known as SiberianTiger
<nealshire>	tortib, I think it would have originally been a dogfight but they probably couldn't get away with it considering how today's culture is so opposed to animal cruelty(but apparently they're okay with it being done with cows...)
<pingfloyd>	he probably ate both bags
<uxfi>	tortib apparently
<uxfi>	tortib would you do the same?
<uxfi>	rob a store while eating chips?
<tortib>	I would put them in one bag
<tortib>	I wouldn't rob a store at all
<tortib>	and no, I wouldn't be eating chips
<pingfloyd>	he was a Frito bandito
<uxfi>	tortib maybe that would be too salty for him
<uxfi>	lol
<tortib>	heh
<uxfi>	I admit funyuns are much saltier
<uxfi>	I havent had one in years ..
<uxfi>	but I just remember them being super salty
<pingfloyd>	a mexican friend of mine, his mom used to call him and his twin brother the frito banditos
<tortib>	pingfloyd, have you used google cloud with s3fs-fuse before?
<pingfloyd>	no
<tortib>	damnit
<uxfi>	tortib hey man did you see Obamas translator?
<tortib>	I can't get it to auth
<uxfi>	Luther?
<pingfloyd>	I avoid cloud where possible
<tortib>	uxfi, no, and quite frankly I don't care.
<tortib>	pingfloyd, it's pretty handy
<uxfi>	But Obama is cool as crap
<pingfloyd>	about all I need is the storage
<tortib>	uxfi, I have nothing against him, I just don't care.
<uxfi>	oh ok
<uxfi>	what have you been doing?
<pingfloyd>	been using dropbox, but contemplating dropping it and going with spideroak
<tortib>	working on my business
<pingfloyd>	Obama sucks
<tortib>	pingfloyd, I also use drop box
<pingfloyd>	he was all disappointment
<tortib>	pingfloyd, how much is spideroak?
<tortib>	do they offer unlimited?
<pingfloyd>	tortib: I'm using the free
<tortib>	and is their client good?
<pingfloyd>	but I know it is very competitive
<tortib>	how much storage does the free version offer?
<pingfloyd>	for 1TB it's $12/month or $129 a year
<tortib>	hmmm
<tortib>	dropbox is $99 a year :/
<tortib>	that's a $30 difference, not that competitive
<pingfloyd>	they have higher plans too of course
<pingfloyd>	but spideroak gives you privacy
<tortib>	lol tru
<tortib>	I'm probably going to switch
<pingfloyd>	dropbox can see all your files
<tortib>	pingfloyd, how is their client?
<pingfloyd>	it works great in linux
<tortib>	if I take a screenshot does it automatically upload it to the storage?
<pingfloyd>	better than dropbox's shitty client
<tortib>	I had some problems with dropbox
<tortib>	but it's working pretty well now
<pingfloyd>	it just worked without any problems
<tortib>	but I'm going to go with spideroak
<pingfloyd>	installed their .deb from their site
<tortib>	because I know motherfuckers have my SSH Keys
<pingfloyd>	and it just worked
<tortib>	and they think i'm dumb and don't know
<pingfloyd>	spideroak does 2-factor encryption
<pingfloyd>	and only you have the keys to the second layer
<pingfloyd>	but that means don't lose your keys ever
<tortib>	It's password based though isn't it?
<pingfloyd>	because they can't recover if you forget them
<tortib>	yeah...that sucks
<tortib>	where the hell am I going to store the keys?
<pingfloyd>	there's really know way around that dilemma
<tortib>	I guess I could burn it to a CD
<pingfloyd>	it can be a password
<tortib>	security is simply an illusion
<pingfloyd>	this is what makes spideroak different https://spideroak.com/zero-knowledge/
<tortib>	yeah i was looking into that the other day
<pingfloyd>	I'd probably use them in addition to local backups
<tortib>	I have backups of backups of backups
<pingfloyd>	just in case you ever lost your keys
<hmir>	So you have six copies of the same data?
<tortib>	pretty much
<hmir>	=\
<tortib>	I also have a NAS that I use for disaster recovery
<pingfloyd>	well better overkill than come up short
<tortib>	but since i'm switching to cloud...there really isn't a reason for that anymore
<pingfloyd>	it's good you've invested well into that
<pingfloyd>	really you just have to figure out what is the most data loss that is acceptable under worst case
<pingfloyd>	can you live with it if a day of data was lost?
<pingfloyd>	an hour's worth?
<pingfloyd>	I think your risk of losing the keys is low though considering your backup habits
<tortib>	no, no way in hell
<pingfloyd>	so worst case you lose it, maybe you lose an hour of the data that wasn't backed up from spideroak
<tortib>	well
<tortib>	I backup daily
<tortib>	so I would lose a day
<tortib>	but hell it's better than losing everything
<pingfloyd>	that takes quite a disaster with your backup
<pingfloyd>	that's more than most people do
<pingfloyd>	also depending on how often your important data changes
<tortib>	does anyone know how to turn on legacy API on code.google.com/apis ?
<tortib>	https://developers.google.com/console/help/  << tells me there but I can't find it :(

<diogenese>	Hi tortib
<Butt3rfly>	so what have I missed? anything fun?
<tortib>	I'm not able to figure out how to use s3fs-fuse with google cloud, the struggle is real.
<diogenese>	You always learn something, so time's not wasted.
<tortib>	I'm not learning anything
<tortib>	it says to use  accessKeyId:secretAccessKey in the documentation, but hell I can't find anything that is named "accesskeyid" in the google api, there is client id and secret key, but those don't work.
<Butt3rfly>	the joys of puzzle solving
<diogenese>	Yes
*	coldsparrow jumps back and kisses himself.

<y0wza>	so far in the us
<Butt3rfly>	and the moral of the story is?
<y0wza>	puts things in2 perspective everyones a buncha fuckin babies
<y0wza>	na thats not it but baltimore sure didnt need all that or nyc just seein the ppl talk to reporters and soundin like idiots

<y0wza>	yeh thats true
<y0wza>	granted thas too many times and theres somethin wrong there wth is goin on
<y0wza>	damn society
<y0wza>	damn van that you cant see any evidence of what really happened inside damned complications to these stories fuckin media eot
<tlt>	that's just three in each state
<coldsparrow>	the revolution will not be televised, but you can catch glimpses of it on the internet
<tlt>	give or tahe

<y0wza>	we can survive
<ceil>	but i don't have a walmart inside : (
<coldsparrow>	lol
<coldsparrow>	we all have a little bit of walmart inside.
<pingfloyd>	walmart sucks
<pingfloyd>	it's full of rude and fat people
<ceil>	pingfloyd: sadly, i don't live on a farm
<ceil>	fat people sure, but who are you running across that's rude?
<ceil>	i don't think another customer has ever said anything to me at a walmart except "excuse me" as they pass by the aisle i'm leaving
<coldsparrow>	of pride is not a sin, and that's why i have gone..on down to walmart with my checkbook just to get you some
<Butt3rfly>	dammit, I need to find a new ISP
<Equinoxdawg>	Butt3rfly: they're now adding restrictions?
<Butt3rfly>	my ISP is selling itself to talk talk, who have restrictions, so it's only a matter of time
<Butt3rfly>	gosh, it looks like the main 5 ISP's have bought up every independant ISP in the country except one
<dw1>	the flash or marvel agents of shield
<Butt3rfly>	the main 5 are contractually obliged to block torrents and video streaming which sux major ass
<y0wza>	lmao
<dw1>	really
<Butt3rfly>	so it's all about plus net baby, all net, no blocks
<Thete>	huh?
<hubik>	i thought plusnet were already owned by BT
<hubik>	good morning btw :D
<Butt3rfly>	no BT doesn't own it, it still operates under it's own rules
<Butt3rfly>	technically BT own almost all of the communication in the UK, it rents phonelines out to companies like plus net

<DoverMo>	i dunno
<tallguy>	i live on the Big Island, we get more local news ... guy got tazed cuz he got confused when park ranger yelled at him to stop & he tried to walk away
<hubik>	the pics aren't the story
<hubik>	the story is you can be assaulted and arrested for doing something you didn't know was illegal
<tallguy>	there are great pics all over volcano sites
<hubik>	and doesn't do any harm
<Butt3rfly>	tallguy, I'd love to visit you

<Butt3rfly>	yes coldsparrow, oceans are my number 2 favourite thing on the planet
<coldsparrow>	Butt3rfly, i have nightmares about the ocean. the raw power, in addition to what may be lurking beneath
<tallguy>	there are really two volcano thangs to see, pu'u o'o caldera is filling up with molten lava more than since 1982
<Butt3rfly>	my dreams of the ocean are almost always benine
<threestar>	this is an admittedly ignorant question, but how often do Hawiians travel between the various islands? do you typically just stay on your island?
<tallguy>	and lava tubes dump lava a few miles down slope, used to goto ocen but now dead-ends upslope
<Butt3rfly>	having visited a volcanic island with no active lava flows or lakes, I'd be inclined to disagree
<Butt3rfly>	there was plenty to see and explore
<tallguy>	some travel interisland often, I hardly ever do, the big island is da best and I live on a nice beach with a good surf break
<Kwaku>	anyone feel like proofing a paper?
<coldsparrow>	nope.
<tallguy>	I have been offisland less than a doz times in 22 years, 3 times to mainland usa
<Butt3rfly>	I've left my island only a handful of times
<Butt3rfly>	no place like home
<tallguy>	interisland air tickets are very expensive $70-180
<threestar>	huh
<tallguy>	depending on advance purchase for 30-40 min flight
<threestar>	As a Texan the concept of living on an island with such limited space is mindblowing to me
<tallguy>	what island Butt3rfly?
<Butt3rfly>	tallguy, UK
<threestar>	but then again I guess I usually don't leave my city, so I guess it's really not that different
<tallguy>	we don't get 'rock fever' big island is not sma;;
<tallguy>	we had biggest cattle ranch privately owned 260,000 acres til owner died & heirs started selling it off

<Butt3rfly>	lol, morning SimenOlai
<SimenOlai>	hi Butt3rfly
<SimenOlai>	Long time no see
<styxem>	SimenOlai: hey, sorry
<SimenOlai>	styxem, you hate me dont you
<styxem>	nope, the window was in the background
<SimenOlai>	Have anyone sued apple yet, based on their charger?
<ceil>	what's wrong with their charger?
<SimenOlai>	In Norway, a 10 year old girl got shocked when she tried to take it out of the outlet, because the "teeth" broke from the charger
<SimenOlai>	so that thing didnt follow up
<SimenOlai>	so she wanted to take out the missing piece
<SimenOlai>	where it was direct contact with the metal
<ceil>	one faulty charger demands a lawsuit?
<SimenOlai>	http://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/?imageId=6863513&width=974.13596491228&height=547.81825597912&x=0&y=0&cropw=100&croph=74.981765134938&digest=3f100afee1
<ceil>	even in the US you need at least a handful of cases before people get all riled up
<SimenOlai>	Well that shouldnt happen, right?
<SimenOlai>	It's glued
<hubik>	is sue short for lawsuit ?
<SimenOlai>	They should atleast put a screw or something
<ceil>	hubik: sure
<ceil>	SimenOlai: are screws common in norwegian plugs?
<hubik>	never really knew what to sue meant
<hubik>	screws are in uk plugs
<SimenOlai>	Well, other chargers are 1 piece kind of
<ceil>	sue (v.) Look up sue at Dictionary.com
<ceil>	 c. 1200, "continue, persevere," from Anglo-French suer "follow after, continue," Old Frenc suir, sivre "pursue, follow after, sue in court" (Modern French suivre), from Vulgar Latin *sequere "follow," from Latin sequi "follow" (see sequel). Sense of "start a lawsuit against" first recorded c. 1300, on notion of "following up" a matter in court. Sometimes sho rt for ensue or pursue. Meaning "make entreaty, petition, plead" (usually with for) is from late 14c.

<ceil>	hubik: The More You Know
<SimenOlai>	It was a school charger too
<SimenOlai>	They have a testing, giving kids ipads as education
<ceil>	my norwegian is a little rusty
<hubik>	hmm
<ceil>	SimenOlai: serves them right for shilling to Apple D:
<SimenOlai>	haha yeah
<SimenOlai>	but gotta go
<SimenOlai>	Driving 1 hour to drive my grandma 15 minutes to the hairdresser/barber (?) and 15 min back, and 1 hour home
<SimenOlai>	Cya!
<hubik>	have fun :p
<ceil>	you must really care about your grandma's hair...
<SimenOlai>	Well her husband isnt home, so he cant drive her
<SimenOlai>	And she never got her drivers license
<ceil>	why is it so important that she get her hair done *right now*?
<SimenOlai>	Well, "right now" can be any time
<SimenOlai>	cya
<ceil>	including after her husband gets home and can take her?
<ceil>	<.<
<SimenOlai>	maybe the appointment was set before the other thing came up
<SimenOlai>	cya
<hubik>	so it's not really a legal term at all, it just means "I'm gonna get ya"
<Butt3rfly>	so it started off all sunny and blue, now there is huge grey clouds all over the sky :/
<Butt3rfly>	such grey
<hubik>	your nick is blue :)

<Butt3rfly>	and 32C
<tallguy>	i really luv sun, Ibuild OffGrid solar power systems 2-3 per year
<Butt3rfly>	I should move, to Gibraltar or somewhere

<tallguy>	pretty damn small rock
<hubik>	is it even an island?

<tallguy>	Gibralter uses usa currency
<idioterna>	tallguy: no
<tallguy>	well they used to
<idioterna>	i don't think so
<idioterna>	they've been part of the british empire since a long time ago
<tallguy>	my friend said they do
<Butt3rfly>	Gibraltar is British
<idioterna>	and recently voted to stay there instead of going back under spain's rule
<idioterna>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar#/media/File:Gibraltar_map-en-edit2.svg
<hubik>	'voted'
<idioterna>	hubik: well yeah
<idioterna>	there was a referendum on that
<tallguy>	you are right idioterna 1 Gibraltar Pound equals
<tallguy>	1.54 US Dollar
<idioterna>	ah, apparently it's been a british territory since 1704
<idioterna>	and has been accepted as british since 1713
<idioterna>	interesting
<tallguy>	my friend lived on gigralter in early 80s
<tallguy>	I guess I misunderstood what he told me
<idioterna>	probably
<idioterna>	spain still contests british rule apparently
<tallguy>	uhhuh I remember something like that ... like the fauklands
<hmir>	I just started this new tv show
<hmir>	it looks really good!

<ssquirrel>	forget that crap
<hmir>	meth and sex go extremely well together.
<d1etyd3vil>	Sudo that Esparanza chick has bigger legs than any of us
<flipapy>	lets list the top ten reasons people make porn? i'll start ( in no particular order) 1. drug addiction
*	Time-Warp cuddles hmir
*	hmir hugs Time-Warp
<Butt3rfly>	https://uk.news.yahoo.com/this-gadget-smells-your-bottom-and-counts-how-often-you-break-wind-150306848.html#yFUH15y lol
<sud0>	she workouts, d1etyd3vil
<redpill>	some only model nude and have never had sex with someone on cam for money etc
<sud0>	that chick u just psoted is full of plastic
<redpill>	nothen wrong with being hot and nude
<sud0>	cant fucking do a single squat
<d1etyd3vil>	flipapy most of them aren't even drug addicts
<redpill>	it is the actions that make one a hoe
<d1etyd3vil>	It's cause its easy to be a woman. All you do is wear your makeup and naked clothes and act like a slut and get men to pay for your stuff
<d1etyd3vil>	That's why they choose the easy way i.e porn
<ssquirrel>	hahah
<ssquirrel>	I only have so many excuses
<d1etyd3vil>	Lol
<ssquirrel>	this is the last
<ssquirrel>	cammon
<ssquirrel>	bleh
<sud0>	esperanza gomez is one of the most well payed actress out there
<ssquirrel>	yuck
<sud0>	and thats because she is naturally hot
<ssquirrel>	you can buy her crap
<ssquirrel>	yes sir
<d1etyd3vil>	Naturally hot lol
<ssquirrel>	hahah
<d1etyd3vil>	Naturally
<ssquirrel>	I'm good at that yes
<sud0>	I have a boner right now cause I thought of her
<d1etyd3vil>	Hahaha
<sud0>	post ur girl again, d1etyd3vil
<ssquirrel>	her?
<ssquirrel>	dude that is murder
<d1etyd3vil>	Sudo now the next thing you will say is that Christina Hendricks isnt hot
<redpill>	that is anything but hot https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Espegomez.jpg
<sud0>	she is, d1etyd3vil
<sud0>	I agree about christina
<d1etyd3vil>	Yay
<ssquirrel>	hahah
<sud0>	but I need to see the difference between some ugly hoe
<ssquirrel>	hey ... how are you
<sud0>	with some stupid extremely slutty face
<sud0>	and a beatiful pornstar
<ssquirrel>	hahah
<sud0>	esperanza and christina are beautiful man
<sud0>	that blonde chick u posted is NASTY
<ssquirrel>	bleh.. well I hate dressing out for gym
<flipapy>	ok, here's a guess at the main resons people make sex tapes:  1. drug addiction, 2. poverty, 3. ignorance, 4. coersion, 5. enslavement, 6. for $$ their children (same as strippers) $$ again, 7. again $$ for education.  how's that?
<d1etyd3vil>	Christina is not beautiful she has an ugly face. But she's hot
*	redpill thinks 90% of the active chatters have never been with a girl.
<ssquirrel>	hahah
<sud0>	u know why esperanza does porn?
<ssquirrel>	yes
<d1etyd3vil>	Cause shes a slut?
<sud0>	do u even know her husband is a friggin billionaire?
<sud0>	no, u didnt know that...
<sud0>	but meh
<sud0>	theres no point in explaining
<flipapy>	for real , or what the script told her to say so she would get paid?
<d1etyd3vil>	flipapy you sound like a feminist in denial
<sud0>	lol
<d1etyd3vil>	This isnt the stone age. Women do porn cause they want to and are sluts. The End
<Butt3rfly>	real women don't do porn
<sud0>	pffft
<flipapy>	whatever helps you slep at night
<sud0>	90% of pornstars are like that
<sud0>	but esperanza is my special one <3
<flipapy>	where are these factscomming from?
<ssquirrel>	why dammit why
<sud0>	and stop loggin this dammit
<ssquirrel>	are you going to hold a shotgun and tell me to get off your land?
<sud0>	so disrepectful
<ssquirrel>	hahah
<ssquirrel>	yes that is always popular
<d1etyd3vil>	Who's logging what
<redpill>	this is the dividing line between Alphas and Betas

<ssquirrel>	I'm saying
<Butt3rfly>	everything except ssquirrel
<ssquirrel>	if you are not legit
<ssquirrel>	hahah
<flipapy>	wow. as if people didnt know. porn is a branch off of prostitution which was legalized thorugh the highly corruptable legal system that will legalize anyhting with enough $$ to hire the legal assistance to process it through. thats just a guess though, dont take me on my word
<ssquirrel>	notice ... except
<irreverant>	Led Zeppelin ladies!
*	Butt3rfly smiles
<ssquirrel>	what are you saying you ass
<ssquirrel>	that is so perverted
<irreverant>	I think I will finish inking my arm in a full half sleeve
<ssquirrel>	blah
<irreverant>	Ramble On! Led Zeppelin
<d1etyd3vil>	I think pornstars are better than "real women". At least they are honest and charge you upfront instead of painting their face and using the opposite sex for free stuff and leeching it off of you over an extended period of time.
<flipapy>	wow, what a man
<flipapy>	pft
<irreverant>	well wait!
<irreverant>	d1etyd3vil, is honest and accurate
<irreverant>	i've felt the same way
<sud0>	thats some deep stuff
<d1etyd3vil>	Thank you.
<irreverant>	a prostitue or pornstar - is upfront about the expectation.
<Butt3rfly>	d1etyd3vil, you have such a view of women, you should really consider sleeping with men instead
<d1etyd3vil>	Hahaha no homo.
<irreverant>	it's still the same result with a non-porno/prosti
<flipapy>	whatever. i still hold that prostitution is wrong.
<irreverant>	because you take them out to dinner; takes money; you buy them gifts; takes more money
<irreverant>	you basically go on "dates" for the same result - sex.
<d1etyd3vil>	Prostitutes/pornstars don't lie and tell you they love you. Then leave you when a better option walks by every 5 minutes
<ssquirrel>	....
<sud0>	dude I love u, irreverant
<irreverant>	it just takes longer; takes more money; takes a bunch of games and the result is not alway sex; but the journey always takes money
<ssquirrel>	hahahah
<Butt3rfly>	d1etyd3vil, you are judging all women based on your 'limited' experience
<d1etyd3vil>	Butt3rfly you should go read your womens magazine and brush up on your 99 sex tips that will make any guy love. 99 every month xD
<ssquirrel>	bleh
<flipapy>	would you marry a pornstar?
<ssquirrel>	yes
<ssquirrel>	if she would stay
<Butt3rfly>	d1etyd3vil, I don't read 'womens' magazines
<d1etyd3vil>	Limited experience? I wasn't born yesterday. Just open your eyes and look around. Or are you in denial
<Time-Warp>	GUYS
<ssquirrel>	lol

<d1etyd3vil>	Hahaha ok whatever makes you sleep at night Butt3rfly.
<Butt3rfly>	your experience is 'limited'
<d1etyd3vil>	Fine.
<flipapy>	yeah Butt3rfly but wouldnt it be better if you had a man you loved that pitched in as much as you did to make it all happen?
<Butt3rfly>	flipapy, I do have that, but I do not wish to be in a relationship
<ssquirrel>	bleh

<d1etyd3vil>	Lol
<flipapy>	strange, imo. i would think if someone loved someone they would not want to share them with other women
<ssquirrel>	they do
<d1etyd3vil>	You have a lot to learn about women flipapy.
<flipapy>	sure i do
<d1etyd3vil>	Heh
<Butt3rfly>	so instead of trying to live with someone in an uncomfortable situation, we just share in the responsibilities that we share
<sud0>	I wouldnt marry a pornstar

<diogenese>	seven samurai
<d1etyd3vil>	We can't be friends flipapy..
<flipapy>	its not nearly as satisfying as focussing on the locations where the swrods meet, and looking ninto the faces of the acors when they say their lines, as opposed to staring at the bottom of the screen

<d1etyd3vil>	Noooo...
<hkr>	d1etyd3vil: what else? puppies and cats?
<klixa-cloud>	those 2 gorillas you saw, they were chimps on steroids and wearing masks
<d1etyd3vil>	Those are bonobos.. Bonobos are like chimps but basically pussies and do what their women say.
<d1etyd3vil>	Puppies and kitties are the best ^.^
<d1etyd3vil>	Omg I wanna go to the animal shelter now :3
<alliphone>	I'm not allowed to go there... my job won't let me be a good pet owner and I know I'd leave with a kitten.
<klixa-cloud>	d1etyd3vil:  so bonobos invented feminism? no wonder it's so primitive
<d1etyd3vil>	Bonobos invented western society in general
<flipapy>	alliphone, is the job really demanding in hours or something?

<d1etyd3vil>	Fowler: I meant what are you on about.

<alliphone>	Hahaha I need succulents on my patio. maybe this year...
<flipapy>	yeah succulent
<Fowler>	d1etyd3vil: Probiotics have to survive your stomach and small intestine if you want them to do anything for you, and chocolate helps the cultures survive better than something like milk
<flipapy>	i dont like spines though, but they do keep the pnat generally bug free
<flipapy>	plant*
<d1etyd3vil>	Are you a nutritionist or a personal trainer or something?

<Fowler>	d1etyd3vil: No
<flipapy>	eat a healthy dinner. drink warm milk after shower and before brushing teeth. get in bed.
<Fowler>	I just saw a study about it the other day
<Fowler>	I'm a microbio student
<d1etyd3vil>	I can feel my heart going crazy and I feel like I'm out of breath and have to puke after 5 minutes
<flipapy>	lay there still and quiet even if not asleep.
<sud0>	just why, hassoon
<flipapy>	continue to repeat to yourself i want to sleep. i want to sleep. stay quiet.
<hassoon>	just who, sud0
<sud0>	just why first, hassoon
<d1etyd3vil>	haha ok insomnia isnt funny
<flipapy>	dont move around, commit to it for a few days d1etyd3vil
<alliphone>	I use while noise machine apps to help me get in a relaxed, sleepy mood
<flipapy>	you will be sleeping normally soon
<hassoon>	just who only, sud0
<sud0>	just why first or no who only, hassoon
<hassoon>	sud0: dood, don't waste my time, you tell me or you gtfo right now.
<alliphone>	d1etyd3vil: have you tried melatonin?
<sud0>	ok, hassoon
<d1etyd3vil>	Yea I tried white noise videos. I'm basically in bed with my eyes closed yawning all night but I know I wont sleep until 72 hours passes by :(
<alliphone>	I have to use it when I jump east coast to west coast
<flipapy>	yeah, or you could just take a pill, and if one doesnt do it, take 2, but thats it, after 2 you talk to a doctor. thats what i would do anyway
<flipapy>	you better be over 18 if you buy sleping pills
<fahadash>	Can we use earwax as a lipbalm?
<alliphone>	mind you, melatonin is the trippy dreams pill
<flipapy>	fahadash, probably
<d1etyd3vil>	Melatonin? Idk what that is. I did take pills for many years but I didnt want to be on crutches anymore.
<flipapy>	but who would want to kiss you?
<alliphone>	melatonin is the natural sleepy chemical in your brain
<d1etyd3vil>	Besides I can either take those pills or go to work
<alliphone>	so it's just a supplement
<d1etyd3vil>	It just made me drowsy all day.
<flipapy>	d1etyd3vil, try eating some turkey babyfood
<d1etyd3vil>	Meh I'll be fine
<fahadash>	If we could use beeswax as lip-balm why not earwax?
<d1etyd3vil>	Burt's Ear
<alliphone>	turkey and chamomile tea
<flipapy>	fahadash, its bitter and riddles with microbes
<d1etyd3vil>	I'll try that turkey sounds nice :D
<d1etyd3vil>	Thanks
<fahadash>	d1etyd3vil: not the wax from Burt's ear. Just our own
<flipapy>	yeah np
<alliphone>	chamomile with honey and lavender room spray
<d1etyd3vil>	lavender room spray lol
<d1etyd3vil>	Or rat poison perhaps
<fahadash>	flipapy: and beeswax don't have that?
<flipapy>	oh and drink a heavy dose of chamomile tea, like 3 baggs in one cup
<flipapy>	fahadash, i dont thik bees wax has dangerous microbes in it, ear wax is formed to defend against intruding microbes, similar to nose mucus
<alliphone>	idk, I know lavender helps me relax
<sud0>	Whenever I cant sleep I just masturbate furiously two or three times in a row
<flipapy>	thats cool alliphone jasmine too and gardenias, actually all flower smells seem to relax me, as long as they arent concentrate
<flipapy>	d*
<d1etyd3vil>	Lol
<alliphone>	ehh

<flipapy>	oh, eh, thats shuld be fine

<sud0>	what if your mom enters your room
<d1etyd3vil>	Then you yell at her to get out.
<alliphone>	hahaha
<d1etyd3vil>	Or stop living with your mom
<flipapy>	they should grow loke loads and loads of jasmine around strip clubs, people would be dishing out the dollars with hope in their eyes... lol,  that is so evil.  dont do that
<idioterna>	alliphone: but only if they know that it's supposed to put them in the mood
<alliphone>	well now they knowß
<sud0>	I would yell: "dont come in I am touching myself!", d1etyd3vil

<d1etyd3vil>	Quite fast too actually
<klixa-cloud>	d1etyd3vil: if you are the type to go crazy eating carbs (ie you are that person who eats 10 cookies instead of 1) it's better to limit carbs
<d1etyd3vil>	Even though I dont work out that much
<flipapy>	if you thought chocolate and sweets are nice, try them with some salted cookies
<klixa-cloud>	d1etyd3vil: i lost 70 pounds in 5 months and ate tons of carbs
<flipapy>	wow
<d1etyd3vil>	I dont even crave cookies anymore. And for some weird reason I actually like the taste of salad now O_O

<berban>	where do you live tortib

<berban>	Massachusetts
<tortib>	what do you mean "probably very little then"?
<tortib>	oh
<tortib>	regarding internet content filtering
<tortib>	I dunno dude
<tortib>	I still think it's filtered.
<berban>	I'm no conspiracy theorist
<tortib>	neither am I
<tortib>	but I still think it's filtered.
<tortib>	10 years ago the internet was completely different than it is now
<tortib>	now it's all cat and doge pictures.
<berban>	lol
<H2O1>	the spying dates back to the Patriot Act
<H2O1>	which dates back to 9/11
<berban>	spying isn't filtering though
<H2O1>	before that there was no warrantless spying
*	bazhang__ is now known as bazhang
<hubik>	and much less self-censorship
<Gershwin>	back then, the internet was nothing like it is now
<berban>	true, I suppose I do self-censor my blog posts about bomb-making
<Gershwin>	now, 70% of all traffic is IP video
<berban>	wpw
<berban>	wow*
<Gershwin>	and of that, it's projected to be mostly VOD in a few years
<H2O1>	great, overwhelm the NSA with video traffic
<Gershwin>	naa, video streams from known sources aren't stored
<Gershwin>	there's tons of refrence material if you want to know the details
<Gershwin>	reference
<H2O1>	no no i dont wanna be overwhelmed with details
<H2O1>	with spying details
<H2O1>	ill leave that to LauraCottonTail
<bazhang>	what
<H2O1>	lol
<LauraCottonTail>	?
<LauraCottonTail>	H2o1??
<H2O1>	hmmm
<x2f>	one of the big troll physics misconceptions:
<LauraCottonTail>	why do you keep highlighting me?

<LauraCottonTail>	are you calling me a pest?
<bazhang>	nopers
<LauraCottonTail>	oh
<x2f>	I was mocking

<x2f>	you know what, i'd rather not teach you the misconception
<LauraCottonTail>	i was speaking to H2O2

<Revol>	hello
<sunstar>	hi
<Revol>	as some of you probably know mos of the torrent search sites are being taken down quite often lately
<Revol>	I wrote an appeal against the court's decision to take them down
<bazhang>	world court
<Revol>	no, uk high court
<bazhang>	the internet
<bazhang>	is not just in the uk
<Revol>	but they took the sites down in uk as well
<Gershwin>	i think he means he addressed his appeal to the UK courts system
<Revol>	so i started with uk high court
<bazhang>	how many armies does the world court have
<Gershwin>	did you post a copy of your appeal online somewhere?
<Revol>	no, why would i?
<bazhang>	why mention it here
<Gershwin>	so others can use it, so others can help, etc
<Revol>	For me it's a private case
<Gershwin>	y'know... for the "cause"
<bazhang>	so you share it in a public chat room
<bazhang>	that makes total sense
<Revol>	because i am pissed
<Gershwin>	i think he/she is about to tell us
<Revol>	and i only talk with you people
<bazhang>	try ##rants
<bazhang>	we dont want it
<Gershwin>	well, some here might
<Revol>	ohh
<Gershwin>	i don't, but i certainly can't speak for everyone
<Revol>	bazhang... why?
<d1etyd3vil>	Why you being a dick to him dude. Maybe you should try ##PMS
<bazhang>	not the ones talking at this very instant
<d1etyd3vil>	Whiny bitch.
<hubik>	who did you write to revol?
<Revol>	oh well, whatever bazhang says, he is right
<sunstar>	as a developer i have found torrenting to be very useful
<Gershwin>	i think he said the UK High Court
<Revol>	unfortunately
<hubik>	"Please do not be rude, judgmental or belittling."
<d1etyd3vil>	Not everyone's a fucking Cisco CCAr who understands how the whole internet works.
<Gershwin>	which is, what, equivalent to U.S. Circuit Court
<bazhang>	wow users will be devastated
<Gershwin>	hehe
<bazhang>	if they notice
<Revol>	rant, u say?
<Revol>	rants?
<Gershwin>	easy on the big multi-syllable words plz
*	MooingLemur moos at tortib 
<Gershwin>	i got a good topic
<Revol>	it's good if bazhang lets u talk about it
<Gershwin>	total *hardware only* costs of new apple watch is roughly 24% of the retail price
<Revol>	the only apple i buy, i eat
<Gershwin>	which means it has the highest profit potential, by far, of any front-line apple product to date (sans some lucrative accessories like covers)
<hubik>	zapple was cool
<d1etyd3vil>	snapple is cool
<Gershwin>	ahh, just found the total dollar cost of hardware
<Revol>	is it apple juice?
<Gershwin>	$83.70
<Gershwin>	of course, that doesn't include apple's internal software costs
<hubik>	don't they have any investment in production Gershwin ?
<Gershwin>	which may add another few % when amortized over how many watches they sell
<hubik>	it can't be all off the shelf parts surely
<Gershwin>	hubik, i dunno how they've got the manuf. and tooling costs financed hubik
<Gershwin>	i must like typing your name :)
<hubik>	erm,
<Gershwin>	could be that the subs are footing the bill, they split 'em, apple is footing 100% of tooling costs, etc....
<hubik>	self-censorship is kinda boring heh
<Gershwin>	i would guess they've pushed it off to subs, but dunno
<Gershwin>	ya lost me
<hubik>	..for a minute there,
<hubik>	..i lost myself
<Gershwin>	+$2.50 ea. to assemble & test
<Gershwin>	wth do these things retail for?
<hubik>	i think people don't realise that they're no longer the target market
<hubik>	may seem ludicrously expensive to you, but you're not a singapore businessman
<d1etyd3vil>	Wut
<Gershwin>	looks like $549 - $949 for
<Gershwin>	oh wait... goes up to...
<Gershwin>	$1099 for the 20 currently avail. models
<hubik>	so if you are rich you will buy it
<Gershwin>	?
<Gershwin>	i don't want one
<Gershwin>	i know my wife wants one... not sure why
<hubik>	there are plenty of people in the gulf, china, russia, africa who can afford this
<Gershwin>	no doubt... try all over the world
<Gershwin>	biggest market being the US
<hubik>	US isn't really a rich country though
<Gershwin>	oooookay
<hubik>	most people have a low disposable income
<d1etyd3vil>	Hmm...
*	codebam_ is now known as codebam
<Gershwin>	i'm with ya hubik... i put the us down there with sudan and somalia
<d1etyd3vil>	Lol
<mansel>	Gershwin: don't forget about the Apple Watch Edition in gold; $15k  http://store.apple.com/us/buy-watch/apple-watch-edition
<mansel>	getting the red band adds an additional $4k
<mansel>	*2k  I can't type...
<Gershwin>	I'd rather forget about it
<hubik>	haven't you seen saudi 12-yr olds donuting rolls royces in the desert?
<diogenese>	smoke em if you got em
<Gershwin>	hubik, i've never taken an interest in that
<WarAndGeese>	I want to meet a saudi prince, I think I'd ask them for $100,000
<WarAndGeese>	maybe after-tax, so a bit more

*	hsr_ is now known as hsr
<phunyguy>	slipmode: one that you drink all day.
<phunyguy>	typically 4% or so ABV

<phunyguy>	Torpedo is 7.2% :-/
<slipmode>	i googled it, thanks though
<phunyguy>	y/w
<pingfloyd>	ice cold of course
<slipmode>	so the point is to drink a weak beer so you dont get as intoxicated
<pingfloyd>	I don't see how some people can drink their beer warm, that's so disgusting
<phunyguy>	actually it is quite delicious around 45F.
<pingfloyd>	colder the better
<slipmode>	pingfloyd, who do you know that drinks warm beer?
<phunyguy>	Germans.
<pingfloyd>	yeah Germans do
<phunyguy>	but their beer is also 40%
<phunyguy>	:(
<pingfloyd>	some people here do as well
<phunyguy>	"beer"
<pingfloyd>	so what if it is 40%, it is still beer
<phunyguy>	yeah but you can only have one.
<slipmode>	haha
<slipmode>	sometiems one is all you need
<phunyguy>	12 oz of that crap.......
<pingfloyd>	it's still not hard liquor
<slipmode>	less pissing
<phunyguy>	eeep.
<slipmode>	i'd love a 40 % abv beer
<phunyguy>	pingfloyd: it's just frozen and skimmed, rather than distilled.
<phunyguy>	same result.
<phunyguy>	alcohol freezes at a colder temp.... so you chill it to that point, and skim the stuff off the top.
<phunyguy>	distilling, the alcohol is the first to evaporate when heated... which you gather and allow to turn back to liquid.

<Butt3rfly>	so it would seem
<tortib>	Is anyone here a doctor?
<pingfloyd>	doctor who?
<ceil>	doctor whom
<ceil>	<.<
<ceil>	is there a new series yet?
<tortib>	I called my physician because I'm having these weird spasms in my legs and arms
<ceil>	i've only seen one series with the new doctor
<y0wza>	doctors got good malpractice insurance real good doctors got many protections against shit 3 trillion different ways
<y0wza>	trus me im a doctor
<tortib>	feels like twitching movement
<y0wza>	http://www.drpeppersnapplegroup.com/smedia/www/2011/04/13/img-dr-pepper-breakout-box-2-10-2-4_154504302956.png
<ceil>	so... what'd your physician say?
<pingfloyd>	did he say they're normal?
<tortib>	he has to "SEE" It?!
<y0wza>	u on meds
<tortib>	no
<ceil>	i recommend pot
<ceil>	you could use a good muscle relaxer
<y0wza>	lol sum skelaxin
<pingfloyd>	I get those every once in a rare while
<tortib>	It's been happening for weeks for me
<pingfloyd>	but it's like a twitch with one muscle
<tortib>	and it only occurs at night for some odd reason
<tortib>	this happens on my calfs and shins
<tortib>	also sometimes in the arms
<y0wza>	charlie horzes suck
<y0wza>	even th oits not that
<y0wza>	just throwin that out there
<tortib>	k
<ceil>	tortib: srsly though, see your physician
<tortib>	yeah, don't really know what he is going to be able to do
<ceil>	you don't wanna find out you have a clot somewhere when it hits your heart or something
<pingfloyd>	he can euthanize you
<ceil>	lol
<y0wza>	thas cool but lemme tell u bout my
<y0wza>	cat
<tortib>	wtf?
<tortib>	pingfloyd, why would I get euthanized, that's a pretty fucked up thing to say.
<slipmode>	tortib
<ceil>	tortib: t'd certainly end the spasms : )
<y0wza>	tortib
<pingfloyd>	I hear Doctor Kevorkian is an ace
<tortib>	ceil, yeah it would end EVERYTHING
<pingfloyd>	too soon?
<ceil>	the solution to all life's problems
<tortib>	I would think so
<y0wza>	yeh
<y0wza>	he only died not 2 long ago
<y0wza>	too soon
<tortib>	what?
<y0wza>	too soon
<pingfloyd>	was he euthanized?
<tortib>	what do you mean he only died not too long ago?
<ceil>	he only died 4 years ago
<y0wza>	too soon
<tortib>	who died?
<slipmode>	pay attention
<y0wza>	tucson
<slipmode>	twit
<pingfloyd>	never seen 4 years be too soon
<ceil>	haha
<tortib>	slipmode, pay attention to what?
<ceil>	Kevorkian died of a thrombosis
<pingfloyd>	if you think that, you haven't seen much stand up
<ceil>	tortib could go the same way if he doesn't go see that doctor
<Butt3rfly>	I get pins and needles at night in my right arm, the doctor could give no explaination of why... I asked him about circulatory issues and he dismissed it...
<ceil>	and make sure the spasms aren't a clot lookin' to ghost his ass
<pingfloyd>	even 1 year isn't in the grey area
<slipmode>	i hope tortib *DOES* die.
<Butt3rfly>	then I had a heart attack
<tortib>	wtf man
<tortib>	what have I ever done to you?
<ceil>	Butt3rfly: that's why malpractice is a thing
<YonicWitch>	wow Butt3rfly
<YonicWitch>	thats malpractice
<Butt3rfly>	ceil, this is not the US, malpractice suits do not exist here
<YonicWitch>	lol didnt even see his comment
<pingfloyd>	no wonder he threw a dart at a dart board for diagnosis
<y0wza>	bout as good as clippy
<y0wza>	i bet bonzi buddy woulda gave a better diagnosis
<pingfloyd>	yeah, the clippy of Medical
<Butt3rfly>	so tortib, I was only 39 and the doctor dismissed the circulatory problems based entirely on my age, but he was wrong
<tortib>	yeah
<pingfloyd>	you chose cake man!
<ceil>	tortib: get some electrolytes until you can see your doctor
<tortib>	I don't know what the issue is but i'm concerned
<ceil>	may help
<go|dfish>	could be magnesium deficiency
<tortib>	I don't think "electrolytes" are going to help
<y0wza>	what
<ceil>	why you putting it in quotes?
<ceil>	it's not like it's some homeopathic voodoo
<y0wza>	its got what plants crave
<pingfloyd>	imagine what hell it would be if Ballmer did the voice acting for Clippy
<ceil>	lol y0wza

<travnewmatic>	so i'm covering
<travnewmatic>	the good thing is, because i'm doing this overnight, i wont work my normal friday shift tomorrow (today)
<sunstar>	of all nights
<dw1>	my name is dr. sbaitso
<dw1>	i am here to help you
<travnewmatic>	well so far hot chocolate mix + coffee + rinsefm has been working pretty well
<travnewmatic>	but i do welcome the company
<travnewmatic>	i only had one thing that i actually had to do tonight
<travnewmatic>	reboot a server
<travnewmatic>	and that was done two hours ago
<prison_>	yo
<travnewmatic>	yo prison_
<travnewmatic>	anyone on kubuntu tonight?
<prison_>	idk what that is
<prison_>	but it sounds tech-y
<travnewmatic>	linux
<travnewmatic>	ubuntu + kde
<lenny>	i'm on a variant of gentoo
<travnewmatic>	oh i see
<travnewmatic>	if anything i'd have guessed debian ;P
<lenny>	haha
<travnewmatic>	never messed with gentoo
<hmir>	Let's dance!
<lenny>	i'm on chromeos lol
<lenny>	technically i wasn't lying
<travnewmatic>	oh :D
<travnewmatic>	i didnt know that was what chromeOS was based on
<travnewmatic>	how do you like chrome os
<travnewmatic>	the idea is very appealing i must admit
<travnewmatic>	and which chromebook do you have?
<lenny>	it's not too bad. i mean, it's a netbook. what do you expect.
<travnewmatic>	mhm
<lenny>	i have the one of the older samsung models
<hmir>	chromeos is horrible.
<travnewmatic>	:(
<travnewmatic>	i was going to ask if i was the exynos or the atom
<prison_>	yea chrome os left me underwhelmed
<prison_>	widevine...owned by google  is not compatible with chrome os
<prison_>	you cant explain that
<sheep>	it works on linux
<prison_>	so i cant watch certain types of streaming media
<sheep>	well, most linux distros
<travnewmatic>	:|
<prison_>	i just wanna watch showtime anytime
<travnewmatic>	hmm
<prison_>	also they recently changed the start menu
<travnewmatic>	uhuh
<prison_>	bastardos
*	hmir blows prison
<hmir>	smoochies!!!!!
<doge>	travnewmatic: I've used ChromeOS and really like it
<prison_>	lol hmir nice cover :P
<prison_>	probably tried to type the _ and hit enter instead
<travnewmatic>	yeah i havent spent any time with it
<hmir>	tee hee!
<travnewmatic>	the price point of the laptops is appealing
<prison_>	chromeos is fast, start up and restart is a matter of seconds
<travnewmatic>	whith the exception of the pixel
<prison_>	yes thats why i got it travnewmatic
<travnewmatic>	thats kinda cool
<prison_>	i dont really need anything for gaming or artwork
<travnewmatic>	uhuh
<prison_>	just needed something for netflix irc and job apps
<travnewmatic>	yeah
<hmir>	Chromeos is retarded!
<prison_>	i just wish there were more apps available
<hmir>	I hate it!
<travnewmatic>	yeah
<hmir>	I've never used it.
<travnewmatic>	like
<prison_>	like there are some but they end up being only useful if you have a smart phone
<prison_>	which i dont
<sunstar>	shun the cloud. stop feeding the beast
<prison_>	hmir: imma poot in your face
<travnewmatic>	hahaha
<prison_>	spinach poots
<hmir>	Get a smart phone prison_. then you and I can stay in touch 24/7!!!!
<prison_>	no
<travnewmatic>	i'm using a dell d620 that i got from my good friend
<travnewmatic>	roommate now actually
<prison_>	i put my phone on airplane mode so i dont get bothered at niht
<hmir>	pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!
<prison_>	hmir:  buy me one and i'll use it
<travnewmatic>	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA4RR2MV5333&nm_mc=KNC-GoogleMKP-PC&cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleMKP-PC-_-pla-_-All+Laptops+%2f+Notebooks-_-9SIA4RR2MV5333&gclid=Cj0KEQjwyIyqBRD4janGs5e67IsBEiQAoF8DGuy20ohFXnCajD4nU3VpNoxtZfp8sNUb5lPuz8dvXdIaAj1V8P8HAQ&gclsrc=aw.ds
<travnewmatic>	this is the better one
<hmir>	Okay, on second thought. maybe staying connected 24/7 isn't such a great idea..
<travnewmatic>	the 630
<prison_>	lol hmir
<hmir>	hahaha
<hmir>	=D
<prison_>	i always feel like somebody's waaatching meeee
<travnewmatic>	how much was your chromebook?
*	hmir snuggles prison_
<prison_>	who's playin tricks on me
<hmir>	Yo mind is playing tricks on you!
<prison_>	uhh with tax and warranty ended up being around 280
<sunstar>	...
<prison_>	i got the toshiba 14 inch
<sunstar>	does it have a hard drive?
<prison_>	16gb
<prison_>	some of which is used by os
<prison_>	you can expand
<sunstar>	i had more space than that in 1998
<travnewmatic>	:D
<prison_>	in 1998 i was learning excel in a middle school classroom
<prison_>	srsly
<prison_>	thats when my love of spreadsheets began
<prison_>	now i know how to use pivot tables and do regression modeling
<travnewmatic>	so for around that price, you can get an older refurb dell, install an actual linux distro on it, and be set
<prison_>	extrapolation
<sunstar>	my school still had no idea what to do with a computer other than replcae the typewriters in the typing class
<prison_>	i dont know how to use linux
<prison_>	im not a tech person
<travnewmatic>	well you managed to figure out irc
<sunstar>	thats what ubuntu is for
<prison_>	lol because of reddit
<travnewmatic>	lol still
<travnewmatic>	ubuntu is stupid easy
<prison_>	im good at figureing shit out on my own i just prefer not to, and i like an intuitive UI
<travnewmatic>	most of the linux ui's are very intuitive
<prison_>	mac's OS prepared me for my upgrade to vista
<sunstar>	grannies and mentally hillarious and children use it without problems. even my airhead sister and neice
<prison_>	i have 4 cpus, 3 running win 98, well 2 the third doesnt turn on, and one on the sp1 version of xp
<sunstar>	3 running 98?
<prison_>	yea
<travnewmatic>	wow
<prison_>	my parents are hoarders
<travnewmatic>	linux is definitely for you
<travnewmatic>	no one needs to be using windows 98 anymore
<sunstar>	nope. on that hardware hes best where hes at
<sunstar>	the ancient past
<travnewmatic>	lol
<prison_>	i had to turn it on because the xp tower im on now wasnt working online wouldnt connect although all network connections were good to go
<travnewmatic>	xfce and lxde are pretty lightweight
<prison_>	idk what i did but the internet works now
<prison_>	and win 98 was a huge throwback
<travnewmatic>	yeah no doubt
<sunstar>	i doubt he has enough ram in those things
<prison_>	the last time i had used it i was going online on msn chats
<prison_>	i was a wee lil thang
<travnewmatic>	omg then just take the boxes to an electronics recycling facility and use the cash to get something made in this century
<prison_>	I just wanna set em up for my nephews
<travnewmatic>	i'm calling cps if you do
<prison_>	i think my olderone has the right analytical mind to do programming
<prison_>	he's almost an asshole with how logical his semantics are
<prison_>	nooo not 98, but linux or ubuntu
<travnewmatic>	then you owe it to him to give him a linux box
<prison_>	something interesting
<travnewmatic>	yeah
<travnewmatic>	when i have a kid i'm going to base their allowance on how well they can use sed and awk
<prison_>	lil man already has 2 ds's, a kindle, an xbox, and skylnaders
<prison_>	hahah train^h8_
<prison_>	crap
<prison_>	meant travnewmatic
<sunstar>	i doubt he has enough ram in those things
<prison_>	im not a he
<prison_>	and i have no idea
<travnewmatic>	then dont install the desktop environment
<prison_>	i'd need an old monitor for it
<sunstar>	wow lots of girls in here
<prison_>	adios y'all im off to start on my new promotion
<travnewmatic>	well congratulations!
<travnewmatic>	good luck!
<travnewmatic>	good chat!
<travnewmatic>	sunstar, what girls
<sunstar>	wow....   totally blew my mind. thought prison_ was a he who knew tech stuff
<travnewmatic>	how hard is it to install another linux distro on your chromebook
<sheep>	it depends on what model chromebook
<hmir>	prison is goneeeeeee!
<hmir>	=\
<travnewmatic>	the exynos one that lenny has
<hmir>	I thought it wouldn't be hard at all to wipe chromeos and put in a netbook edition version of some linu distro.
<hmir>	Unless google locks their chromebooks down or something, and even then, I'm sure there are workarounds.
<sunstar>	you can replace explorer.exe with another UI. how come no one has ever made one?
<kline>	hmir: the CR-48 had a developer switch that did that but permaset a bit that voided warranty
<kline>	sunstar: people have
<sunstar>	linux has tons of em and windows just has explorer
<sunstar>	oh yeah?
<kline>	yeah
<hmir>	Voiding warranty should be taken as a given.
<hmir>	When you wipe the OS.
<kline>	hmir: should it really though?
<sheep>	it depends on the terms of the warranty
<sheep>	sometimes that just voids the software warranty but not hardware warranties
<hmir>	No, I guess not. At least not on a hardware level. But you buy the chromebook under THEIR conditions, not yours.
<kline>	sad, isnt it?
<hmir>	Way she goes.
<hmir>	Other netbook type devices are available.
<travnewmatic>	so what to do, get a chromebook, or get an old refurbished dell
<travnewmatic>	from what i've read its kind of a bitch to shoehorn linux onto chromebooks
<travnewmatic>	but easy as hell on..  anything else
<travnewmatic>	and you get a full os, not an overblown browser
<hmir>	Yes. Get a proper laptop in a smaller dimension.
<hmir>	10-14 inch.
<travnewmatic>	mhm
<hmir>	I like physical keyboards, but most people are okay with onscreen keyboards these days. Which has rendered netbooks obsolete by tablets.
<sunstar>	i got a netbook to put linux on.   unbox it and find it wont boot anything debian based (havent tried any non debs)
<travnewmatic>	hmir, i detest typing on screens, but i think you're right for a lot of people
<travnewmatic>	thats really odd sunstar
<hmir>	sunstar is really odd, i agree.
<travnewmatic>	:D
<sunstar>	this pipe tastes like new car smell
<n0lan>	sup
<sunstar>	yu
<n0lan>	yeah I went to bed early and just got up.
<sunstar>	i should be in bed. its 330 am
<sunstar>	but instead im remarking on how my pipe tastes like new car smell
<hmir>	i've just started noticing this thing with actresses.
<sunstar>	they're all liars?
<travnewmatic>	sunstar, its 420 somewhere
<hmir>	they all seem to have a very typical type of nose (in addition to other matching physical traits of course).
<sunstar>	gotta have that hollywood look
<hmir>	Nope!
<travnewmatic>	lol
<hmir>	you know the nose I'm talking about tho? Like that michael jackson nose.
<sunstar>	http://people.duke.edu/~charlie/AmishVirus.html
<hmir>	the one he had after 187872112 surgeries.
*	n0lan was on a date Wednesday and the guy smoked me out with some good weed yo
<hmir>	Stop dating drug users.
<sunstar>	that just leaves u with straight edge squares
<hmir>	Straight edge is the best edge!
<sunstar>	i like mine jagged and uneven (cuz i gots no dexterity!)
<hmir>	Jagged edge is the name of a grammy winning band!
*	sunstar wonders about jagged little pill
<sunstar>	had to win something
<sunstar>	wow im old for knowing what that is
<sunstar>	that was like 20 years ago
<hmir>	I liked one or two songs on that album.
<hmir>	Maybe even three or four songs!
<hmir>	It;'s like rainnnnnnn on your wedding day!
<sunstar>	i always thought it was rain on your radiator
<hmir>	Maybe that's in tehre too, i don't remember.
<hmir>	Maybe that's in tehre too, i don't remember // it's a free ride when you've already paid - that's the chorus on ironic.
<sunstar>	no i just got songs wrong a lot. like spice girls i thought it was "if you wanna be my luva, you gotta get with my friends"
<Gluesticky>	What is it supposed to be I have no idea X-D
<sunstar>	no idea
<hmir>	Makes sense to me.
<hmir>	If you wanna get in my pants, you gotta be friends with my friends!
<hmir>	Ya'll don't know how that works? If you wanna sleep with a girl, you make friends with her best friends and get her on your side!
<sunstar>	then the friends be cock blocking
<sunstar>	if they arent getting any themselves. or sometimes its just nature and they dont know why they be hateing
<hmir>	Only if you don't get along with her friends.
<hmir>	That's the whole point.
<sunstar>	i have a hard time having girl friends. they get all bitchy and catty and posessive and jelous.   tons of times they either cock blocked me or stole the man and appologized saying they had no idea what came over them
<hmir>	You're a woman?
<sunstar>	yea
<hmir>	A woman that doesn't have any or very few girlfriends === red flag!!!!!!!!
<hmir>	haha
<Gluesticky>	So you have lots of guy friends, what's the problem?
<sunstar>	just saying.
<sunstar>	being all nicey with the friends aint a garentee
<hmir>	It's a good move tho.
<hmir>	If it doesn't work, then tryin another angle.
<H2O1>	hiii girls and folks
<sunstar>	wb
<H2O1>	:-P
<hmir>	hi sweet thang
<hmir>	smoochies!
<sunstar>	mmmm    popcorn flavored vapidge
<hmir>	What is a vapidge?
<hmir>	Is it like porridge?
<sunstar>	slacker term for e-cigarrete smokage
<hmir>	Yuck!!!!!
<hmir>	Vile habit.
<sunstar>	ur a vile habbit
<Romance>	wow Microsoft just introduced http://how-old.net/ , it will tell how old a person based on face
<sunstar>	wow
<sunstar>	okay im ready to blow my brains out
<Romance>	i uploaded mine and it tells 14, lol im 26 this year , i think its because im asian and i always look younger than my age
<hmir>	=(
<sunstar>	i just found out a close friend of mine who is korean is about twice my age. i thought we were about the same age
<diogenese>	It's hard to tell with some people.
<Romance>	i uploaded my american friend photo, she is 24 but how-old.net tells she is 46
<hmir>	46 HAHAHAHA
<hmir>	nice!
<sunstar>	in drug years
<Romance>	that will sadden her
<sunstar>	yeah she dont need to know microsoft thiniks shes an old hag
<hmir>	omg u guise, nap time!!!!
<hmir>	tell your hag friend I said hi!
<Romance>	that how-old.net biased to western people, i uploaded random asian photos and it will always tell they are 29 below
<n0lan>	ok im gonna try laying down in bed again\
<n0lan>	night y'all
<Romance>	when i uploaded random white people photos most of them are 40 above
*	n0lan turns off computer
<sunstar>	yay! it says im 21
<Romance>	you are legal then sunstar
<H2O1>	no woman in her sane mind would try her own photo on a site like that
<sunstar>	y not?
<H2O1>	theres nothing in the world i hate more than being asked by a woman "how old do you think i am?"
<H2O1>	women who ask me that question tend to have hand plenty of sunburns and look 10 years older than their real age anyway
<H2O1>	am i supposed to lie?
<sunstar>	yes
<H2O1>	s'/have hand/have had/
<sunstar>	great... ive lagged out again huh?
<travnewmatic>	30
<travnewmatic>	more
<travnewmatic>	minutes
<Gluesticky>	Well that site was pretty accurate for me.
<Romance>	Gluesticky: maybe but a lot are not
<diogenese>	Can't detect my face. Not geared for old guys I guess.
<Gluesticky>	It said I was 4 years younger.
<Romance>	diogenese: dont upload your whole body, it may think your belly is your ..nevermind
<diogenese>	I did just the face. A couple of different pics too.
<Gluesticky>	I guess you're not human.
<Romance>	weird, i uploaded few with people wear glasses and small and laughing
<H2O1>	did it give the same age for each picture?
<Romance>	it worked
<diogenese>	I tried a monkey pic for fun too. Didn't detect that either.
<sunstar>	i uploaded a shot of me in a swimsuit and it knew my head from my ass...         dont know why that surprised me or why i think its so funny
<Romance>	sunstar: your ass is 21 then, i like younger ass
<diogenese>	Found one it likes. Says I'm 38. lol
<Romance>	the wrinkles' effect diogenese
<diogenese>	Off by 19 years. I'm 57
<Romance>	holy lol
<H2O1>	i bet it gives you 10 years mre after a hard day's work when you look tired

<wtf-honey>	and hi Equinoxdawg
<Equinoxdawg>	o/
<Scourjee>	Yes, I don't live there anymore
<Scourjee>	I'm creating a shelter in the woods
<wtf-honey>	with free wifi?
<Equinoxdawg>	Er.. I'm not sure whether that's an upgrade or downgrade
<Scourjee>	I'm not there right now
<Scourjee>	But thats why I've been gone for a week
<Scourjee>	No wifi
<Equinoxdawg>	so he came in to advertise his blog, which he won't be able to update because he's living in a forest... right
<wtf-honey>	lol i think so
<Aristide>	Hello :)
<wtf-honey>	hi
<Aristide>	May 1st : No bus, no subway, NOTHING :x

<Deithrian>	errr
<H2O1>	grrr
<Deithrian>	wtf is going on O_o got banned from ##programming and have no clue why?!
<H2O1>	try /mode ##programming +b
<H2O1>	you may be able to appeal your ban
<Deithrian>	fix my connection?!?!?!?
<H2O1>	is that a k-line or a ban?
<H2O1>	no, certainly not a kline since youre obviuosly here
<Deithrian>	If it was k-line I shouldn't be here?!
<Deithrian>	right
<Nexia>	Deithrian, http://prntscr.com/7093qf
<Nexia>	Your connection :P
<Deithrian>	Max SendQ I was not sending anything
<magellan>	whats a k line
<Deithrian>	I was taking a shower lol
<Deithrian>	well thanks Nexia :)
<Deithrian>	I'll just remove that chan from autojoin
<Nexia>	magellan: Network ban?
<Nexia>	yw
<Deithrian>	My client very funny
<Deithrian>	what about the shitty freenode servers that drop connections at will?!
<magellan>	Nexia: as in you could get banned from the whole freenode network?
<Nexia>	Yes?
<Deithrian>	I had a practice to use a specific US server that didn't have that behavior with the default Freenode servers
<Nexia>	magellan: Meaning you basically can't connect to the network altogether, only freenode staff (IRC cops, I think that's what they call them, rather than "channel ops" ) can do that.
<magellan>	Nexia: ok thanks

<Scourjee>	Hi
<Scourjee>	Who was I talking to yesterday
<Scourjee>	I do not remember, but it was interesting
<dw1>	was it
<Scourjee>	Yes
<Scourjee>	I've been writing my book On Beyond Time & The Other Side
<dw1>	what haz been revealed to thee
<smgs>	Scourjee writing is a scourge
<smgs>	lol
<Scourjee>	Infact, I went to the other side yesterday
<dw1>	is there a beer store over there
<dw1>	or summin
<smgs>	only turtles
<Scourjee>	The other side is not a single plane of exsistence, it's more of a collection of events
<dw1>	an animated flip book
<dw1>	innit
<Scourjee>	You're part of the sliding operation
<Scourjee>	You are no longer whom I'm talking to
<Scourjee>	You do not know it, but you are
<dw1>	:o
<Scourjee>	I was once compromised too
<Scourjee>	In 2011-2014
<dw1>	i take the voices for a ride
<dw1>	screw em
<Gluesticky>	There are lots of mediums.
<Scourjee>	onbeyondtime.blogspot.com
<Gluesticky>	When I was high I connected to other people's consciousness and spoke through them.
<Scourjee>	That is similar to Beyond time
<Scourjee>	Beyond time can travel infinite distances instantly, stretching across multible timelines aswell
<Scourjee>	The other side has everything that has ever happened in the universe, and that will ever happen.
<JesusIsLordAmen>	"I am God, and there is no one like Me, 10 Declaring the end from the beginning, And from ancient times things which have not been done"
<hubik>	hhmmm
<JesusIsLordAmen>	*not yet done.
<Gluesticky>	This is just a movie.
<hubik>	is it a holiday in the usa too?
<Scourjee>	What is just a movie
<Gluesticky>	I think our planet has already been destroyed by accident.
*	hubik wonders why the term 'talkie' never took off
<Gluesticky>	There are walkie talkies.
<hubik>	and sitty watchies
<hubik>	i see
<dw1>	talk about the box rick
<dw1>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXCXVWjSbik
<Scourjee>	Yes
<Scourjee>	The world collasped
<Scourjee>	I've seen it many times
<Scourjee>	Not a apocalyspe but the economy probably fell and the government
<Scourjee>	But there are still humans
<dw1>	you can't know
<dw1>	the aliens hid it all man
<dw1>	hide*
<dw1>	:d
<dw1>	JesusIsLordAmen++
<dw1>	you cant see past the One
<dw1>	:p
<Scourjee>	Aliens have already been defeated
<JesusIsLordAmen>	be careful of "mediums", they are not who they appear to be. Isaiah 8:19 "And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead? 20To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them." (masquerading
<JesusIsLordAmen>	as messengers of light).
<Scourjee>	They now have their technology, and will use it against us
*	hubik waves to dw1 
<dw1>	hi
<hubik>	happy may day :D
<dw1>	plus a few hundred years tech can kill us instantly im sure
<dw1>	but the galactic UN puts sanctions on the terrorist groups ..

*	Padawan_ is now known as Padawan

<Padawan>	hubik: wut
<dw1>	life's a movie
<dw1>	be kind, rewind
<Padawan>	like Donnie did?
<dw1>	that was a mindbender
<dw1>	i did research and still dont really get it
<dw1>	lols
<Padawan>	Really?
<Padawan>	I only regret that it went to cinemas soon after 9-11
<Padawan>	And it didn't make the deserved money IMO
<dw1>	i didnt really watch it until recently
<JesusIsLordAmen>	dw1: Corinthians 14:33 "For God is _not_ the author of confusion"
<Padawan>	dw1: me neither. I wanted to, but i reminded i feared the movie since i watched as a child and was scared of bunnies
<JesusIsLordAmen>	*1 cor
<Padawan>	dw1: but then i watched it 6 months ago... i will never regret
<Scourjee>	Most people who talk about the bible online are Shills
<dw1>	JesusIsLordAmen: "I make peace and create evil" Isa 45:7
<H2O1>	Bible stuff hehe
<Padawan>	Scourjee: what are Shills?
<Scourjee>	JesusIsLordAmen:  You are compromised
<Scourjee>	There are different levels of shill
<H2O1>	there are different levels of hell
<H2O1>	HELL!
<Scourjee>	The trolls who just spam and attack indiscriminate users
<H2O1>	trolls grrr
<Scourjee>	And then there are shills, who are much more advanced, but less of
<H2O1>	dw1, do you believe in hell?
<dw1>	shills dont care bout irc imo
<dw1>	what's to believe
<dw1>	i'll see it when i get there
<H2O1>	O_O
<dw1>	:P
<H2O1>	so you expect to get there
<H2O1>	?
<dw1>	why not
<dw1>	sounds like a fun road trip
<H2O1>	why not heaven?
<dw1>	sure
<dw1>	sounds good too
<JesusIsLordAmen>	Scourjee: 2 corinthians 11 "12 And I will keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about. 13 For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as apostles of Christ. 14 And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. 15 It is not surprising, then,
<JesusIsLordAmen>	if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve".
<JesusIsLordAmen>	you call me compromised, but i do not speak from my own imagination.
<dw1>	i dont 'expect' per se
<dw1>	it's just crazy ideas
<Scourjee>	Satan can never control this planet until it learns to live and love
<dw1>	metaphors for energy
<magellan>	uhhh im falling asleep at my desk
<Padawan>	why would people discuss the bible here?
<H2O1>	Satan controls this planet secretly in the background
<H2O1>	dw1, that explains all those false flag conspiracies
<magellan>	because it's fun
<dw1>	satan = adversary = anything negative
<JesusIsLordAmen>	Padawan i counterpointed the discussion about medium and alternate realities and astral projection. Nothing more.
<Padawan>	dw1: thats my definition
<Scourjee>	There are three major dimensions that I have identified so far
<Padawan>	Like my boss, he is my real adversary
<JesusIsLordAmen>	dw1 satan is one of the many nicknames in the bible for the deciever. (another one), it means he who accuses god. Another is assyrian, king of babylon, king of tyre, wicked pharao of egypt, the most proud one, the destroyer and many others.
<Scourjee>	Our physical world, The Other Side, and the Energy Dimension
<Padawan>	Scourjee: how can you identify the other side?
<Scourjee>	Everybody and more has beyond time capablilties, they may not know it
<dw1>	http://www.vitamincity.com/pix%20rodin/Symbol_Of_Enlightenment_Aet.gif
<Scourjee>	I don't know how to access it directly, whenever I want
<dw1>	the other side http://a3.ec-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/136/328441d9d7504a248a389eae77dd571a/l.jpg
<dw1>	hehe
<dw1>	and the energy is 3 6 9
<Scourjee>	And I can't control where it takes me
<H2O1>	im no fan of symbolism
<H2O1>	or numerology
<dw1>	vortex math
<dw1>	all spirals towards 9
<dw1>	and is held by the 9
<dw1>	hehe
<JesusIsLordAmen>	<H2O1> Satan controls this planet secretly in the background (through his minions) <-  2 cor 4:4"In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them."
<dw1>	it's how i saw god
<H2O1>	god or God?
<dw1>	the one
<JesusIsLordAmen>	Is why in the bible he takes jesus up on a mountain (allegorically) and shows him all the kings and empires throughout time saying he will give jesus these if he worships him, and jesus says to satan, you are the one who will ultimately worship the true god.
<Scourjee>	When I say I believe in God, I believe in a higher presence
<dw1>	really
<Scourjee>	An energy
<dw1>	J
<Padawan>	Scourjee: Like George Carlin said in his show
<dw1>	i believe the presence is the one that contains and permeates duality
<Padawan>	Have you watched it?
<Butt3rfly>	ugh, 2000 year old clap-trap, like we don't have enough modern bullshit to deal with, we get that too
<dw1>	not sure if conscientious per se
<dw1>	i think the consciousness is me :p
<Scourjee>	No
<JesusIsLordAmen>	Satan might rule through his minions but the true god is in control. And jesus christ is lord.
<dw1>	☯
<Padawan>	Scourjee: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8r-e2NDSTuE watch it fully, it really is good IMO
<Scourjee>	I don't watch tv, but I'll check that link out sometime
<H2O1>	dw1, sounds like ##philosophy stuff. i just checked the ban list (/mode ##philosophy +b) and im afraid we're still both banned
<H2O1>	:(
<vrlogrs>	hi everyone
<Scourjee>	Padawan: I can give you my book on monday
<Scourjee>	If you are interested
<vrlogrs>	if you can spare a few mins, please visit www.funnode.com
<Padawan>	Scourjee: which book?
<vrlogrs>	looking for feedback on a site i've been working on
<dw1>	H2O1: dont care - i was done there long ago :p
<Scourjee>	"On Beyond Time & The Other Side"
<H2O1>	what did you do exactly to get banned?
<Padawan>	vrlogrs: send me the link, ill pop up tor browser and test it
<dw1>	i told a sexist joke as a joke
<H2O1>	ok
<Scourjee>	I haven't published it
<Padawan>	uhh
<Padawan>	really?
<Scourjee>	But I posted alot of stuff about it on my blog and reddit
<JesusIsLordAmen>	Scourjee be VERY careful about mediums and the "new age movement". I've been in that myself for many years in the past.
<dw1>	i dont believe spirits can control me
<dw1>	nor do i try to view or talk to them :p
<H2O1>	they can only control mediums
<dw1>	or care if they exist
<Padawan>	Finally it all end up for a believe factor. And it is really difficult to change believes
<H2O1>	you should, you'll be one eventually
<Scourjee>	I have a couple of chapters written but I just haven't uploaded it anymore
<dw1>	H2O1: that assumes the universe will remain when i die :p
<JesusIsLordAmen>	it's directly outlawed in the bible for a reason. trance mediums is demonic posession. And is directly outlawed in the bible. But today people do not know the bible and therefore do not know the warnings, and think it's cute and funny.
<dw1>	and more
<dw1>	we cant know shit bout the other side
<Scourjee>	Am I possessed
<H2O1>	dw1, it will but your interface to it will change
<Scourjee>	I am trying to lock myself in the other side
<Scourjee>	I can never stay for very long
<dw1>	although one time i tried to astral project and woke up with my head ringing
<Scourjee>	Sometimes I think I enter but come back with no knowledge
<dw1>	cracked my pineal :p
<JesusIsLordAmen>	the transmediums will literally admit/tell you that they move their conciousness aside for something else to enter them.
<Scourjee>	Other times I have truly seen events a Day before they happened
<JesusIsLordAmen>	the non fake variety that is. Lot of scammers aswell ofcourse.
<H2O1>	dw1, heres your song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL0EoXdpOqg
<dw1>	Scourjee: kewl
<JesusIsLordAmen>	the non fake variety are the really uncanny and disturbing kind.
<Butt3rfly>	you're not possessed Scourjee, you're just crazy
<Scourjee>	No
<Scourjee>	I'm awake
<JesusIsLordAmen>	ah you're being "enlightened" is what they tell you, right?
<Scourjee>	I was once compromised, for years
<Scourjee>	I intercept rogue beyond time signals
<JesusIsLordAmen>	and the christians are "compromised"
<JesusIsLordAmen>	see how that works.
<Scourjee>	I they think freed me from the enslavement
<JesusIsLordAmen>	christians have the only text that warns about it.
<Scourjee>	I'm not sure from what year or timeline these signals are coming from
<Scourjee>	But they reach out beyond time itself, and that is where it extends
<Scourjee>	They are hitting us with indiscriminate directed energy strikes to block out these signals
<Butt3rfly>	definitely crazy
<Butt3rfly>	certified
<Scourjee>	I go indepth on beyond time signals in my book
<Scourjee>	I have only been able to log one signal I intercepted
<JesusIsLordAmen>	well i will pray for you.
<Butt3rfly>	i can't even understand more than 3 sentences, why would I read your book
<Scourjee>	It was just Xenotype
<Butt3rfly>	it's just crazyman babbling
<Scourjee>	Over and over
<Scourjee>	I heard Xenotype..Xenotype I'm not sure why
<JesusIsLordAmen>	Butt3rfly it's not to him, i've been in the new age movement myself for many years in the past. To them it is real.
<Scourjee>	But it ended with a crashing sound, and that is evidence of the jamming
<Butt3rfly>	like god is real to you
<Scourjee>	I refuse to live in fear
<Scourjee>	I can't have this level of fear in my life
<Scourjee>	Every hour could be the end the way it seems now
<Scourjee>	I have the constant thought in the back of my mind
<Butt3rfly>	madness is also real
<H2O1>	Butt3rfly, i don't think he is mad and anyway just telling him he is isn't the way to deal with the issue
<Butt3rfly>	really? and you have a better way?
<H2O1>	neither of us knows how to deal with this
<JesusIsLordAmen>	Butt3rfly the bible is prophetic fortelling empires throughout the ages, and things not yet happened, with pinpoint accuracy. This is the authenticator and the bible itself says if it not prophetic and simultaneously acknlowledges jesus as lord, is not not from the true god but from the deciever. The fallen children of the watchers became disincarnate spirits (demons) This is what the trance
<JesusIsLordAmen>	mediums etc. are connecting into. Being disincarnate they can see things that regular people cannot. And trance mediums willingly allow them to speak through them. With messages of "new age" where christians have to become extinct ofcourse, because they are "in the way".
<Butt3rfly>	and how would you deal with that H2O1? ^
<JesusIsLordAmen>	and teaching how humanity is to become "enlightened".
<JesusIsLordAmen>	what light is that, be very careful to get involved in it.
<Butt3rfly>	my response would be something like "god is just as real as santa clause and the tooth faerie"
<H2O1>	how do you explain the Big Bang?
<H2O1>	did the Big Bang just exploded out of nothing?
<H2O1>	s/exploded/explode/
<Butt3rfly>	I don't believe there ever was a 'Big Bang' I believe stephen hawkin made a big ass mistake
<dw1>	yeah maybe it was a slow trickle
<dw1>	then a whirlwhind
<JesusIsLordAmen>	My response would be read the bible and study it very intently you will find some things you did not expect, galatians is a very good place to start to explain christ and how mosaic law no longer applies and the different between the old covenant of the flesh and the new covenant of the spirit, but that is your choice. And you have your oppinion. Which is fine.
<Butt3rfly>	lol dw1
<dw1>	who the hell knows
<H2O1>	its not Stephen Hawkin. the Big Bang dates back to the 1930s and was figured by a Jesuit priest
<H2O1>	read the Wikipedia entry
<H2O1>	*the discovery of the Big Bang
<JesusIsLordAmen>	the genesis describes a solar centric creation. Because it is a book written for man living on earth. If you study it with a bit of tenacity and looking up the original hebrew rendering you will realize that the order in which things were created start to add up. It is describing the creation of this solar system. The rest of the universe is left out of how the detail of its creation.
<Butt3rfly>	H2O1, a Jesuit priest may have come up with the idea originally, but it was stephen hawkins confirmation using modern mathematics that lead to it being widely accepted
<JesusIsLordAmen>	you can't have living planets without a sun, that's why the light was made and god saw it was good etc. And the smaller light (the moon) for signs.
<dw1>	JesusIsLordAmen: john 8:58 vs matt 1:1 - god vs man
<dw1>	JesusIsLordAmen: psalm 82:6-8 you are God with a capital G
<dw1>	arise
<dw1>	JesusIsLordAmen: old gov god isnt the One god :)
<dw1>	old cov*
<H2O1>	dw1, grrreat stuff!
<H2O1>	lol
<dw1>	mm frosted flakes
<JesusIsLordAmen>	galatians explain very well why the mosaic law was put in place (because of transgressions to prepare for christ, because of what satan had done to earth) When christ came loving your neighbourgh as yourself is the highest of the law. And it speaks in the letters about how the guardians of the old covenant of the flesh wanted to keep circumcision etc. making christ of non effect.
<dw1>	JesusIsLordAmen: its real. do what jesus did in court and crack the temple
<JesusIsLordAmen>	christ being the new covenant of the spirit where there was no jew or gentile or things like this but all were children of christ through faith in christ.
<dw1>	destroy your legal idols and bear witness
<dw1>	:)
<dw1>	you arent resurrected yet
<dw1>	in this life or the next :P

<gamma>	Butt3rfly: o/
<gamma>	How are ya?
<Butt3rfly>	:) I'm good
<gamma>	Good to hear.
<Butt3rfly>	so back to stephen hawkins then... the big bang
<H2O1>	tsk tsk
<Butt3rfly>	did it bang or were the equations flawed?
<H2O1>	it banged and we had a functional universe forthwith
<H2O1>	banged out of nothing!!!
<Butt3rfly>	you see I have one niggly little question about that, we banged out of a singularity, where was this 'singularity' before it banged?
<H2O1>	same thing for the misc exo-universes all around our universe
<Butt3rfly>	it was somewhere, somewhere outside of the universe that it created?
<H2O1>	outside or above
<H2O1>	more likely above
<H2O1>	above, if you assume a hierarchy of universe
<H2O1>	*universes
<Butt3rfly>	I'm not sure hierarchy applies to something that is expanding in every direction
<H2O1>	conceptual stuff, like a tree in computer science
<H2O1>	(data structures 101)
<H2O1>	you have a tree of universes -- thats the hierarchy -- and our universe is just one of the leaves
<H2O1>	the exo-universes around our universe are other leaves
<Butt3rfly>	lol
<Butt3rfly>	very good
<Butt3rfly>	the tree of life is an age old religious concept too
<H2O1>	you dont believe in any religious stuff, do you
<Butt3rfly>	nope
<H2O1>	i like everything spiritual and religious
<H2O1>	that doesnt mean that i believe in it all
<H2O1>	far from it
<Butt3rfly>	for me, parenthood took the spirituality out of my beliefs, when I had to decide what stories to tell my kids as they were growing up
<Butt3rfly>	you know, like tooth faeries and santa clauses,
<Butt3rfly>	I just could not bring myself to try and convince my children that something existed, when I didn't "know" that to be true
<Padawan>	H2O1: Sincere question where can i read from this tree universe thing?
<Padawan>	And... like If we are talking about a collection of universes, and our universe were banged out of nothing. And by nothing, you mean the leave right before us in the data structure?
<dc2>	ill be in gatwick tomorrow :O

<redpill>	in the US he would be in Gitmo: http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/04/25/man-arrested-for-flying-drone-carrying-radioactive-sand-in-tokyo/
<redpill>	in Japan max 3 years
<princefakhan>	whats the punishment for just flying a drone.
<princefakhan>	they are illegal in many countries? arent they?
<bazhang>	there is no evidence to suggest gitmo would be the outcome
<bazhang>	but as a hot button trying to start something, nice effort
<redpill>	these days in the US everything is a weapon of mass destruction
<bazhang>	no evidence at all
<princefakhan>	oh. haha.
<bazhang>	try ##politics , they like made up stuff like that redpill

<redpill>	many others as well
<hubik>	why are you called redpill ?
<princefakhan>	btw, did Obama ever said about shutting down Gitmo or something like that.
<redpill>	why are you called hubik?
<bazhang>	princefakhan, you really want to go with this?

<hubik>	hubik has a number of meanings
<bazhang>	redpill, almost no one here is from the US

<princefakhan>	bazhang nah! I just want to know if he did.
<bazhang>	princefakhan, bing it
<princefakhan>	I don't know what to trust anymore on the news.

<bazhang>	for all the frespech!!!11ers out there
<princefakhan>	how must it have anything to do with religion
<Butt3rfly>	lol bazhang
<bazhang>	it doesnt, he just wants to start something, and there are no takers
<redpill>	bazhang: and yet you post more political stuff about the first amendment, I am not from the US I care little about such things

*	Butt3rfly hugs klixa 
<bazhang>	whats the problem klixa
<hubik>	hmm, have you asked paperclip?
<klixa>	Butt3rfly: lol thanks
*	ChanServ gives channel operator status to bazhang
*	ChanServ removes channel operator status from bazhang
<princefakhan>	Yeah! he left.
<klixa>	bazhang: im not sure; the laptop gets stuck on the loading screen... so i put in a win 8.1 usb, and if i click repair i get a blue screen and nothing else no options...if i click install windows, same thing
<hmir>	I wrote an inspired riff!
<princefakhan>	try Win10 TP
<bazhang>	sounds like the win usb is not correctly written, tbh
<Butt3rfly>	what error does the blue screen give you?
<bazhang>	press the 'any' key
<klixa>	Butt3rfly: its just a blank blue screen, not a bluescreen of death
<Butt3rfly>	:o
<princefakhan>	looks like the screen where it loads.
<klixa>	it boots, its asks my lamgauge, etc... if i choose install it goes to a blank screen and does nothing...if i click repair same thing
<klixa>	the hard drive, just has the win logo and spinning thing then gives me the sad face and reboots...
<Butt3rfly>	that's not anything I have ever come across so far so I don't know... does it start up in safe mode?
<bazhang>	what was used to write the iso to usb
<hmir>	Does it have a 'test cd/usb' function like linux based disc/usb isos do?
<hmir>	maybe the iso you wrote to the usb drive is corrupt.
<klixa>	bazhang: bootamp on a mac... i used this exact same usb to install the os initially months ago...and i tried 2 different ones today
<princefakhan>	well your PC aint booting for some reason. Do you think it may be corrupted.
<bazhang>	was it a legit iso, or a warezy type deal
<klixa>	bazhang: it was fom MS directly
<klixa>	not pirated, etc at all
<bazhang>	what about trying the iso in a vbox
<princefakhan>	btw, I make bootable image via PowerISO.
*	Mapleyy is now known as SWARJE
*	SWARJE is now known as Mapleyy
<klixa>	ill try that just to rue it out... im thinking the laptops hardware is just messed up or something
<klixa>	rule*
<princefakhan>	and what about burning it to a DVD.
<bazhang>	that wont make a diff prince
<princefakhan>	now that you say. It aint installing either.
<princefakhan>	definitely hardware.
<Butt3rfly>	can you access the bios?
<klixa>	Butt3rfly: yeah and i changed stuff like legacy vs uefi. etc
<Butt3rfly>	can you restore the bios to default?
<klixa>	did that already
<klixa>	and then readjusted, causey ou cant boot win 8.1 except in legacy  mode
<Butt3rfly>	k, and there is no indication in your bios that any hardware is failing?
<bazhang>	this is on a mac
<klixa>	no, i just made tyhe iso on a mac
<klixa>	its an acer aspire v5
<bazhang>	ah
<klixa>	made the usb i mean
<bazhang>	yep
<bazhang>	thats the issue I bet
<klixa>	hmm, after sitting for 30 min finally got options
<princefakhan>	so It can't boot and neither installs windows. right?
<klixa>	well just now the menu finally came up...but it took 30 min...so something is wrong
<bazhang>	wait, its responding now
<klixa>	yeah i got to taht screen that has the sqaures and picked refresh.... now pale blue and nothing some more... maybe it will eventually do seomthing again...
<princefakhan>	If not hardware. then your installation is corrupted.
<bazhang>	how much longer is the warranty on that
<klixa>	im checking the is in VB in a second as soon as its installed
<klixa>	iso*
<princefakhan>	do you suspect viruses.
<klixa>	princefakhan: im at a loss, hence talking about it....i thought this would be an easy fix..pop in usb, refresh and be done
<bazhang>	it should be
<tortib>	dub dub dub dub dub funked up
<princefakhan>	If it is not getting installed, or refreshed. I am sure its nothing software related.
<bazhang>	is this your main computer
<klixa>	bazhang: no, my mac is
<tortib>	why use bootcamp when you can just use a VM?
<klixa>	tortib: i used botcamp to make the usb...because netbootin, etc never works
<klixa>	bootcamp is just tools that make iso's, and partitions your drive
<tortib>	what are you trying to accomplish?
<klixa>	tortib: tl;dr; windows wont install or repair on this pc i am trying to fix
<tortib>	oh
<tortib>	what's wrong with the machine?
<princefakhan>	that's what needs to be figured out tortib
<tortib>	...
<tortib>	Usually if someone says "Hey fix this computer" they will tell you what's wrong with it.
<bazhang>	that has yet to be determined
<bazhang>	calm down torty
<klixa>	lol
<princefakhan>	:D
*	tortib does a headspin
<klixa>	tortib: the issue is it wont boot... the reasons are unkown
<tortib>	ah okay
<tortib>	klixa, how far along the boot process does it get?
<Butt3rfly>	tortib, we've established that the problem is, it wont get past the start up screen
<tortib>	ok
<bazhang>	most irc clients have scroll
<Butt3rfly>	indeed
<bazhang>	upgrade to one that has that
<klixa>	ok, iso is fine, just checked it in vbox
<tortib>	yeah and you're assuming i'm not lazy and will actually scroll up
<klixa>	too lazy to scroll= too lazy to be privy to whats going on, lol
<tortib>	k
<tortib>	figure it out yourself
<tortib>	was just trying to help
<bazhang>	we were
<princefakhan>	and is the lappy still on start screen
<bazhang>	bye bye
<Butt3rfly>	stroppy knickers lol
<tortib>	I know when someone pays me to fix their computer, I don't come on IRC asking for help.
<klixa>	princefakhan: after 30 min i finally got options...the 3 squres..i chose refresh...and now a pale blue screen and nothing
<princefakhan>	or the blue screen as we all were calling it
<bazhang>	another county heard from
<klixa>	im just waiting it out
<klixa>	tortib: it my computer
<klixa>	no one is psaying me
<princefakhan>	oh! I thought you were booting to windows.
<klixa>	princefakhan: im tring to do a repair from the usb
<tortib>	all you have to be is 10% smarter than the machine
<princefakhan>	nevermind. so it is still there.
<princefakhan>	maybe another half an hour.
<Butt3rfly>	tortib, even if someone was paying klixa, I'd help her, she has a new baby coming and needs everyones support
<princefakhan>	and you see something exciting.
<tortib>	hah, like someone having a baby is my problem.
<klixa>	Butt3rfly: lol thanks... my biggest obstacle was my toddle trying to *help* me
<bazhang>	he wants to slow down the process with some alleged witty commentary
<klixa>	but, she is distracted now
<princefakhan>	oh! congrats klixa
<klixa>	thanks princefakhan
<Butt3rfly>	you don't have to make it your problem tortib, but other among us are humane
<princefakhan>	:D
<bazhang>	OUCH
<tortib>	Well i'm a robot
*	tortib does the robot
<Butt3rfly>	lol
<bazhang>	thats gonna leave a mark
<tortib>	Wouldn't you want a robot fixing a machine?
<klixa>	tortib: chill... i get you were trying to help...it didnt go unnoticed :P
<tortib>	Makes sense to me
<tortib>	robots making robots
<princefakhan>	well I don't care what you are tortib but we were hlping someone and you distracted sus all
<tortib>	matrix style

*	tortib melts down
<bazhang>	is it fixed
<tortib>	Have you tried unplugging it and plugging it back in?
<klixa>	no, im just waiting it out... if it doesnt work, then something is wrong with the hardware
*	ChanServ gives channel operator status to bazhang
<princefakhan>	u r welcome.
*	ChanServ removes channel operator status from bazhang
<tortib>	was that called for? :/
<bazhang>	yes
<princefakhan>	I am sure it is the hardware.
<Butt3rfly>	:o
<klixa>	princefakhan: hard drive controller is my guess if i had to at this point...woudl it do something liek this
<princefakhan>	now I am not a hardware guy, but do you think ram could be doing this.
<klixa>	i had a badly corrupted drive  months ago, got a new one, did fresh isntall...and now its doing this... so... that is the only thing i can come up with
<princefakhan>	oh lol! again. who is the hardware guy here.
<bazhang>	do a memtest with a live linux cd
<klixa>	u
<klixa>	oops
<bazhang>	and badblocks on the drive in question
<princefakhan>	I have a very small linux os which has memtest and other tools like it. dont remeber the name.
<bazhang>	all of them have it
<princefakhan>	i think RescueOS
<klixa>	i used to have taht kind of stuff, before i had my first baby i was a computer technician... but i havent even used winodows in 2+ years now
<klixa>	win 8 is so alien to me
<princefakhan>	ah! you were away from shit for 2 years. thats great.
<bazhang>	aside from taking it in to a shop, best bet is boot a linux live cd, do a memtest and badblocks
<klixa>	yeah im gonna do the linux thing next
<bazhang>	or liv eusb
<princefakhan>	though I would suggest you install Win10. be it the preview. it works great.
<bazhang>	on potentially bad hw?
<bazhang>	not great advice
<klixa>	princefakhan: if i have a hardware issue preventing a win 8 install... not sure win 10 would install either?
<princefakhan>	offcourse after all this is sorted out.
<princefakhan>	yeah.
<bazhang>	its not even beta
<princefakhan>	it is beta.
<klixa>	this is the computer my bf  uses...hed rather have win 7 over anything
<klixa>	he hates change
<princefakhan>	I don't. but then I'm not your bf. xD
<bazhang>	there is no fixed release date, not even beta, no
<klixa>	yeah, if it were mine, id do 10...i had ysemete dv preview on my mac as soon as it came out
<Butt3rfly>	I'd rather use win 7 than win 8
<princefakhan>	I am amazed he switched from xp. lol.
<klixa>	princefakhan: haha
<klixa>	he started on 7 actually
<klixa>	hes not a computer person really
<Butt3rfly>	win8 was really lame to be fair
<klixa>	i bought start 8 for it, it makes it a lot better
<princefakhan>	oh. well he started on a fine machine then.
<klixa>	i cant believe they took the meny bar out...
<princefakhan>	you should have installed Pokki.
<klixa>	i didnt like pokki
<princefakhan>	oh!
<klixa>	i tried most of the free ones
<princefakhan>	I don't know but I liked Win8.
<princefakhan>	actually 8.1
<princefakhan>	I hated many things in 8 actually.
<hmir>	9.1 is nasty.
<klixa>	8.1 is on this machien, i really dont know how its different form 8.
<hmir>	8.1*
<klixa>	i have used both combined 2 hours total ever maybe
<hmir>	i hate it so much. I hate it more than I hate spinach.
<princefakhan>	it is.
<hmir>	p.s. I love spinach.
<klixa>	and its always been when something was wrong and i was fixing it
<princefakhan>	you have all the metro apps on desktop.
<princefakhan>	I don't remember much other features. lol. though there were great features.
<princefakhan>	maybe I didn't get used to it and installed Win10 before that. lol.
<tortib>	OS X 4 lyfe
<princefakhan>	well the only thing apple that is good.
<tortib>	I hate OS X
<tortib>	it's so...simple
<bazhang>	so what
<princefakhan>	or not half bitten I would say.
<princefakhan>	some people like it simple you know.
<tortib>	would it have killed them to put numerical status indicator on file transfer dialogs?
<princefakhan>	Windows has gotten so complex after Win8.
<tortib>	computers are not supposed to be simple
<hmir>	You know what's simple? A shell.
<bazhang>	sounds like theres something flamey trying to be started here
<princefakhan>	Home Computers are supposed to be simple.
<tortib>	says who?
<princefakhan>	that's how Apple, IBM, Windows selled home computers in the good ol' days
<tortib>	It really depends on what the individual defines as simple
<tortib>	what might be 'simple' to someone may not be simple to another
<bazhang>	OS/2?
<princefakhan>	*sold.
<tortib>	bazhang, that was an engineering OS
<tortib>	and it was damn good
<princefakhan>	tranferring a file from here to there is simple.
<bazhang>	I wanted the IBM simple example
<tortib>	it's simple in OS X too, especially with scp
<princefakhan>	and every sane mind can do that.
<tortib>	oh so you have to be crazy to understand more complex features of an operating system?
<princefakhan>	and why is that a problem.
<d1etyd3vil>	Hello.
<tortib>	hi
<bazhang>	total channel meltdown: just ahead
<d1etyd3vil>	Lol
<princefakhan>	Yeah sure. there are complex things in OSes and that is not for everybody tbh.
<princefakhan>	Yeah sure. there are complex things in OSes and that is not for everybody tbh.
<princefakhan>	hey there.
<tortib>	princefakhan, then maybe they shouldn't be using it.
<princefakhan>	well they use it for the simple things.
<tortib>	maybe they should stick with a fisher price speak n' spell
<bazhang>	prove it
<princefakhan>	they can go on without the complex.
<d1etyd3vil>	Fisher price speak n spell
<tortib>	I don't have to "prove" my opinion.
<bazhang>	not you
<tortib>	o
<d1etyd3vil>	Or that round one that goes like "A cow says mooo"
<princefakhan>	the complex is for people like us.
<bazhang>	princefakhan, is making some wild claims, prove them
*	hmir slaps d1etyd3vil upside down with a small whale
<tortib>	🐮 🐄
<tortib>	wrong button D:
<d1etyd3vil>	What is a small whale anyway
<tortib>	computers are hard
<d1etyd3vil>	Try yelling at it tortib
<bazhang>	a narwhal
<princefakhan>	no they arent.
<bazhang>	bing it
<tortib>	d1etyd3vil, tried that
<princefakhan>	they are but they arent.
<d1etyd3vil>	Bing is the best >:)
<bazhang>	princefakhan, try making some sense
<tortib>	computers are the most complex device on the earth.
<tortib>	there isn't anything more complex available
<d1etyd3vil>	Does plan9 have internet support lol
<tortib>	d1etyd3vil, of course.
<bazhang>	s/computers/applewatches/
<tortib>	has a full TCP/IP stack
<princefakhan>	Yes they are the most complex machines. but I thought we were talking OSes.
<tortib>	where do you think other operating systems got their code from?
<tortib>	princefakhan, the OS is also complex
<tortib>	princefakhan, just because the engineers make the UI 'simple' does not mean they're not complex.
<princefakhan>	and using it.
<tortib>	they make it simple on purpose
<tortib>	and people still fuck it up
<princefakhan>	yeah. for everyday user actually.
<d1etyd3vil>	Computers are fine. It's printers that I hate.
<tortib>	printers are pretty complex
<princefakhan>	I think we were talking about the end product. werent we?
<d1etyd3vil>	Printers are the universe's way of telling us to kill ourselves
<tortib>	printing has come so damn far compared to the Gutenberg press
<klixa>	pretty soon it will all be simple cause we are evolving towards tablet os-es
<tortib>	tons of evolution
<tortib>	tablet os-es are a gimick
<tortib>	the whole tablet market is just a stupid gimick
<tortib>	Even the lead developer said that windows 8 was made for tablets
<princefakhan>	tablets arent tablet actually.
<tortib>	and the damn manufacturers put it on desktops
<princefakhan>	the companies deviated from the concept to sell some more devices.
<tortib>	because MS needs moar monies
<tortib>	smart phones are practical
<tortib>	you can carry a computer in your pocket
<tortib>	that's practical
<tortib>	how the hell is a tablet practical?
<d1etyd3vil>	How did we watch porn in bed before smartphones
<d1etyd3vil>	Tablets are cool for watching netflix.
<tortib>	VHS but you're probably a youngin so you have no idea what that is
<princefakhan>	laptops I think
<tortib>	you know what's really cool for watching netflix?
<klixa>	tortib: my ipad mini is GREAT for using as a movire player in the car for my toddler on long trips
<tortib>	a fucking TV
<klixa>	also i have kids apps on it, etc
<klixa>	so, imo...tablets are a great kids toy
<tortib>	klixa, why don't you try talking to your child instead of having them watch bullshit?
<d1etyd3vil>	Lol
<klixa>	tortib: i just drove form california to maine... you talk for 6 days straight :P
<tortib>	hahaha
<princefakhan>	that. the tabs concept was not actually for childs.
<tortib>	touche ;p
<d1etyd3vil>	6 days?
<princefakhan>	it was for office use.
<d1etyd3vil>	What were you driving a bicycle
<tortib>	unicycle
<tortib>	the child was running behind them with a tablet watching nutflix
<klixa>	d1etyd3vil: yeah, 6 days... its like 4000 miles almost
<tortib>	klixa, did you stop to rest?
<klixa>	tortib: yeah, each night
<tortib>	yeah that's a long haul
<klixa>	anyway, ipad is a car toy.... at hime, like right now, she likes to throw crayons at me instead
<klixa>	fun times
<Butt3rfly>	lol
<tortib>	put the tablet infront of their face
<d1etyd3vil>	Damn it's actually a 49 hour drive
<tortib>	that will occupy them
<d1etyd3vil>	Nothing but road. I'd probably just kill myself
<tortib>	yeah because you totally achieve something by killing yourself
<d1etyd3vil>	Peace
<tortib>	that's how to get to the end goal
<tortib>	off yourself
<d1etyd3vil>	What goal
*	Butt3rfly reminisses about when her babies were actually babies drawing on the walls and stuff, much less scary than now when they are starting to make their own way in the big wide world

<tortib>	ah
<klixa>	Butt3rfly: yeah, at least now, i can fully contain/protect her
<klixa>	tortib: i see no issue wiht toddlers using ipads, etc... as long as its only sometimes
<Butt3rfly>	yes klixa, enjoy that stage, it's over in no time
<klixa>	some people, stick their kids on fron to fstuff and never interact, and im not into that
<tortib>	klixa, yeah, I understand, I was merely kidding about the talk to your child thing.  Of course you should speak to your child, but at the same token, like you stated, you can't talk for 6 days straight. :P

<d1etyd3vil>	Did you watch it when it released
*	tx runs
<d1etyd3vil>	Oh...
<klixa>	Butt3rfly: i had no empathy at age 4 when i saw bambi
<klixa>	so i didnt care
<bazhang>	I thought: mmmm venison
<d1etyd3vil>	Was this the original Bambi from 1942...
<princefakhan>	and you did not see it ever since.
<Butt3rfly>	i was 4 too, it devastated me for months lol
<klixa>	when i was a kid, death, etc didnt affect me at all...it wwasnt until i was older that i changed
<doge>	D:
<d1etyd3vil>	So you're 77 years old?
<d1etyd3vil>	Stop trolling
<Butt3rfly>	yes d1etyd3vil but I watched it in 1977
<klixa>	i watched it in 83
<princefakhan>	never assume a ladies age.
<bazhang>	growanewbrain.com d1etyd3vil
<d1etyd3vil>	I calculated it
<princefakhan>	you may land in trouble.
<klixa>	i dont get the whole womans age thing...
<d1etyd3vil>	2015 - 1942 + 4
<klixa>	lol
<Butt3rfly>	in 1977, I was 4, now go and do some real math
<princefakhan>	its bullshit is all.
<klixa>	im 36, cuse i know you are too dumb to do math, so im helping
<klixa>	:D
<Butt3rfly>	lol klixa
<princefakhan>	:P
<klixa>	man, i remeber being 14 and thinking 36 might as well have been 76
<d1etyd3vil>	Why is it okay to guess a man's age but not a woman's. Sexist?
<d1etyd3vil>	Reverse sexism?
<Butt3rfly>	when I saw Bambi, I swore I would never go back to the cinema, I was 16 the next time I went to the cinema
<klixa>	technically its kinda rude to guess anyones age, i would imagien
<princefakhan>	damn!
<klixa>	i dont care about age tho
<princefakhan>	and how was it Butt3rfly
<Butt3rfly>	much better princefakhan
<princefakhan>	oh. haha!
<tortib>	I'm 33, but I have the mental capacity of a 5 year old.
<bazhang>	we know
<princefakhan>	xD
<Butt3rfly>	:o
<tortib>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<bazhang>	Bambi was re-released to theatres in 1947, 1957, 1966, 1975, 1982, and 1988
<bazhang>	d1etyd3vil, ^
<d1etyd3vil>	I'm 25, but I have the mental capacity of a rock.
<hmir>	omg plot twist ending!!!!
<tortib>	d1etyd3vil, well damn dude, that sucks.
<princefakhan>	have some disney facts for food.
<d1etyd3vil>	Why would they do that. Bambi wasn't even that good. It was depressing
<klixa>	guess i saw it in 82 then not 83
<klixa>	so i was 3
<princefakhan>	and you may be able to guess peoples age right.
<klixa>	but i saw it at a disocunt dollar type movie theatere...
<klixa>	so could have still been 84 i think...i dunno
<bazhang>	or the release lasted a year / longer
<klixa>	yeah maybe
<d1etyd3vil>	disocunt dollar type were the best
<klixa>	i remebr i got an astro pop and popcorn
<d1etyd3vil>	Can't get those for a dollar anymore
<princefakhan>	your age is still the same. isn't it, klixa. xD
<Butt3rfly>	i watched it in 77, in the uk so the release was delayed
<klixa>	princefakhan: lol yeah
<bazhang>	princefakhan, is this your first interaction with other humans
<princefakhan>	when you say popcorn. I recently went to watch Avengers and damn that popcorn cost more than the movie.
<princefakhan>	why do you assume so.
<tortib>	concessions are expensive as hell now
<d1etyd3vil>	That's why you take your own popcorn..
<klixa>	i havent been to a theatre in years
<bazhang>	the general lack of clues
<tortib>	that's how they make their money
<klixa>	i download stuff
<coldsparrow>	lol @bazhang
<d1etyd3vil>	You shouldn't have said that. The cops are on their way. Downloading is bad mmkay.
<klixa>	in the past i didnt go cause i was a smoker... and couldnt go 2 hours without a cigarette...but now i have a kid
<Butt3rfly>	I took my youngest to see the lego movie in 3D
<tortib>	I take a microwave, gas powered generator and a bag of popcorn with me to the movies, so I can pop the popcorn fresh and enjoy it in the theater.
<princefakhan>	one does not simply take their own popcorn to a theatre.
<klixa>	i love the lego movie
<princefakhan>	its is harder than mordor.
<klixa>	EVERTHING IS AWESOME
<tortib>	some people get angry at me because I have a gas powered generator running in the theater, they're so rude.
<d1etyd3vil>	That's the way to do it tortib
<Butt3rfly>	it was awesome on a big screen klixa
<Butt3rfly>	I think I enjoyed it more than my son did
<tortib>	I liked the lego movie

<Butt3rfly>	Banzaikitten, you know I wont do that for you, you have asked me before and I didn't do it then
<Banzaikitten>	well
<Banzaikitten>	suck on my balls
<coldsparrow>	haha
<Banzaikitten>	normally i wouldn't say that to a woman of your age but
<Banzaikitten>	considering i want to be banned
<Butt3rfly>	Banzaikitten, I know you don't want to upset me
<sunstar>	you need computers anonomous or something?
<Banzaikitten>	look bazhang im maming this horrible for Butt3rfly
<Banzaikitten>	making
<treefiddy_>	i could just say "ur banned" and then you could leave the channel
<sunstar>	there is help out there for online addiction
<Butt3rfly>	Banzaikitten, you know I'm not upset because I know you don't mean it
<y0wza>	the 2 step program
<pingfloyd>	yeah, probably just too much sugar
<cleerline>	Banzaikitten:  cant you become and operator and ban yourself??
<pingfloyd>	and skipping nap time
<treefiddy_>	i tried to nap
<Banzaikitten>	cleerline: hm that is an option
<duckgoose>	 
<Banzaikitten>	but it might take me several years to earn bazhangs favour
<cleerline>	kiss him. Might speed up the process
<pingfloyd>	you must be obsessed to even contemplate that
<Butt3rfly>	Banzaikitten, why don't you try being as nice to bazhang as you are to me in other rooms
<Banzaikitten>	im nice to you in other rooms?
<pingfloyd>	motel rooms?
<Butt3rfly>	lol
<tortib>	This isn't AOl
<tortib>	It's IRC
<pingfloyd>	don't fall for it, it's all an act
<tortib>	they're called CHANNELS
<tortib>	not ROOMS
<Banzaikitten>	yes me and Butt3rfly could meet at a hotel
<Banzaikitten>	in
<Banzaikitten>	shropshire?
<Banzaikitten>	staines?
<treefiddy_>	distinction without a difference
<treefiddy_>	room/channel etc are synonymous
<pingfloyd>	pretty much
<tortib>	no, they're not
<duckgoose>	channels are chat rooms
<duckgoose>	:(
<tortib>	read the god damn protocol
<treefiddy_>	anything else is pretentious
<Banzaikitten>	who r the other admins in this channel
<tortib>	it doesn't say rooms
<pingfloyd>	it's too late to worry about superfluous synonymous terminology
<tortib>	it says channels
<treefiddy_>	 Banzaikitten /cs access ##chat list
<sunstar>	no one knows what the fuck you geezers are talking about.    has nobody told you you're all  old and out of touch?
<pingfloyd>	almost every nomenclature has been butchered and twice-baked
<tortib>	https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459
<tortib>	Read
<tortib>	1.3
<tortib>	what does it say?
<treefiddy_>	haha sunstar
<tortib>	does it say Rooms?
<treefiddy_>	tortib nobody cares
<Butt3rfly>	Banzaikitten, you are in a furrie suit, who do you think you are scaring?
<coldsparrow>	treefiddy_ was born on aol
<pingfloyd>	furry suits are scary in their own right
<Banzaikitten>	Butt3rfly: i think you are stalking the wrong person
<duckgoose>	Chat Room: an area on the Internet or other computer network where users can communicate
<treefiddy_>	coldsparrow: my initial coding began there yes. but ive grown over the years
<tortib>	treefiddy_, tons of people care, just because you don't care doesn't mean nobody else does.
<duckgoose>	:'(
<Butt3rfly>	I dont stalk, I flutter
<treefiddy_>	room
<Banzaikitten>	right well one day im going to start mass pinging the channel
<duckgoose>	some furry suits look pretty professional actually
<treefiddy_>	lounge
<pingfloyd>	a furry suit thrusts the question upon you, "harmless loony, or total psycho?"
<duckgoose>	you'd mistake them for a mascot
<treefiddy_>	area
<Banzaikitten>	but not yet
<Banzaikitten>	im going to lie in wait
<Banzaikitten>	no one will know
<Banzaikitten>	that i plan to mass ping the channel
<treefiddy_>	they're no longer rooms and channels, they're gardens
<Banzaikitten>	http://33.media.tumblr.com/2e156c7ae9faa1635d0cc4e772730e8e/tumblr_mzyn1rozrt1t0dgu6o1_400.gif SFW
<tortib>	no, they're still channels
<Banzaikitten>	VERY SAFE
<Banzaikitten>	ENJOY THE SAFENESS
<Banzaikitten>	its safe
<Banzaikitten>	children
<Banzaikitten>	have a look
<Audioburn_work>	Banzaikitten, wow really
<Banzaikitten>	yes
<Banzaikitten>	really
<tortib>	hey bazhang, want to ban this guy?
<duckgoose>	treefiddy_ normal users don't understand the concept of data channels
<Banzaikitten>	tortib: what a great fucking idea
<Banzaikitten>	bazhang: what do you say?
<treefiddy_>	chat room definition: a branch of a computer network or a software application in which participants can engage in real-time discussions about a specific topic with one another (group chat)
<Audioburn_work>	Banzaikitten, her ass will be sore
<Audioburn_work>	dude was balls deep
<Banzaikitten>	thats disgusting
<pingfloyd>	room is just a later synonymous term that came along
<Audioburn_work>	Banzaikitten, er, you posted it
<Banzaikitten>	i dont look at horrible things like that I just link them in order to get banned from channels
<treefiddy_>	i can find websites too
<pingfloyd>	resistance is futile unless you want to be an angry old man
<Audioburn_work>	Banzaikitten, uh huh
<duckgoose>	pingfloyd true but that doesn't make the term incorrect!
<treefiddy_>	how do you know what they are unless you look at them
<Banzaikitten>	i just glance at them for a second
<Banzaikitten>	but ai vomit virtually everytime
<Audioburn_work>	okay
<Banzaikitten>	im incredibly sensitive like that
<pingfloyd>	because butchering that word is like nothing compared to the damage to computer jargon as a whole
<treefiddy_>	i just like calling it a chat room to watch fanbois brains melt
<tortib>	Heh, brains are not melting.
<tortib>	You just don't like being corrected.
<pingfloyd>	it's like sweating tears in a flood
<duckgoose>	to be fair "channel" is a poor name as well
<duckgoose>	group chat is the proper thing to call what these are
<treefiddy_>	i speak truth
<Audioburn_work>	your tears are so delicious
<pingfloyd>	duckgoose: so are most of the terms and acronyms most people use today
<tortib>	So do I
<tortib>	and I have a RFC to back me up.
<Banzaikitten>	http://roarlocal.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/giant_cock_zps07527b3c.png MAN WITH HIS GIANT COCK (SFW)
<duckgoose>	the RFC for IRC holds IRC back
<duckgoose>	IRC has grown past the RFC spec
<treefiddy_>	but i have a more recent definition to back me up
<Audioburn_work>	south park is so ridiculous
<Audioburn_work>	and necessary
<treefiddy_>	and since words and terms are amorphous and change over time... im right. ur wrong.
<treefiddy_>	south park is awesome
<Banzaikitten>	did anyone click that last link
<Banzaikitten>	it was actually sfw
<Banzaikitten>	i promise
<Banzaikitten>	Butt3rfly: i promise
<pingfloyd>	RFCs are the standard
<duckgoose>	yes
<duckgoose>	I saw a huge cock
<Banzaikitten>	but a safe for work cock?
<duckgoose>	yes
<tortib>	treefiddy_, rooms were called exactly that when AOL was relevant, it isn't recent, it's just as old as the channel naming.
<duckgoose>	it was a handsome one
<pingfloyd>	didn't compuserve call them rooms too?
<treefiddy_>	and it was more than aol that used the term
<Audioburn_work>	Banzaikitten, wow nsfw
<treefiddy_>	icq, yahoo, aol, etc
<tortib>	treefiddy_, yeah Yahoo as well.
<Banzaikitten>	well if u find chickens sexually attractive Audioburn_work
<tortib>	and for IRC it's called...channel.
<Banzaikitten>	maybe
<tortib>	not room.
<treefiddy_>	you'll argue about anything
<treefiddy_>	haha
<duckgoose>	well
<duckgoose>	compuserve was owned by aol
<pingfloyd>	BBSes called them chat rooms too
<duckgoose>	so I wouldn't count that
<tortib>	https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CAcQjRw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fxkcd.com%2F386%2F&ei=EfhDVcPrH5LFogTx94HIDg&bvm=bv.92291466,d.cGU&psig=AFQjCNHeO3P1ONH8gJgjMYMoESJPDUsJCw&ust=1430604180745563
<treefiddy_>	i really like this chat room you have here
<treefiddy_>	it is very nice chat room
<duckgoose>	compuserve and ICQ both were AOL owned
<tortib>	pingfloyd, If you actually read the RFC that I linked.  It clearly states that IRC was developed as a means for users on BBS systems to communicate with eachother.
<duckgoose>	you have to disqualify those :P
<Banzaikitten>	Douglas had to poop. His butt was all stinky because he had to poop so badly. There was a gross woman named Rebecca who was sunbathing all naked, and she was fat. Douglas walked up to her and said, "I need to poop." "Okay," Rebecca replied, "I like poop." Douglas squatted down over the fat sunbathing lady and went poop. The poop sat there on Rebecca's boobs looking like a wiener.
<pingfloyd>	tortib: yet most BBSes didn't use irc at all
<Audioburn_work>	Banzaikitten, kek
<tortib>	pingfloyd, that's what the creator of the protocol made it for.
<tortib>	another means of communication so BBS users could chat in real time.
<pingfloyd>	if they had a gateway they might have you run ircii through a shell
<treefiddy_>	do you sit down in a room all by yourself, surrounded by monitors, all displaying RFC's for various components and get naked and have happy time to all the RFC's?
<sunstar>	is that not normal?
<sunstar>	cuz i do that
<tortib>	treefiddy_, no I just know what i'm talking about.
<duckgoose>	bazhang I suggest +b *!*@*
<treefiddy_>	you think you know
<duckgoose>	this will solve all problems
<treefiddy_>	but you dont know
<tortib>	no, I do know.
<Audioburn_work>	HOW DOES PANDORA KNOW WHERE I LIVE
<treefiddy_>	you're just trying to hold on to old things
<treefiddy_>	instead of embracing change
<duckgoose>	Audioburn_work chrome.
<penguin1263>	CHROME DRONE CHROME DRONE CHROME DRONE CHROME DRONE CHROME DRONE CHROME DRONE CHROME!
<duckgoose>	chrome will give your location to websites if you allow it to
<duckgoose>	which it gets from your android devices like phones
<tortib>	treefiddy_, and you clearly ignore facts even when they're handed to you on a silver platter. :)
<pingfloyd>	tortib: you do realize your RFC discovery isn't even a tip of the iceberg on massacred standards?
<Audioburn_work>	fak u gooby
<treefiddy_>	you probably do this to people who call coke pop or soda don't you
<tortib>	treefiddy_, I do.
<pingfloyd>	if anything, that's rather a mulligan compared to most
<treefiddy_>	and you're still wrong haha
<HotCoder>	sup treefiddy_
<tortib>	nah, not wrong.
<duckgoose>	for the record
<treefiddy_>	hey HotCoder
<treefiddy_>	they -q'd me
<treefiddy_>	haha
<duckgoose>	screwdat is sending people harassing PMs
<HotCoder>	ye finally
<HotCoder>	glad to see you back
<bazhang>	treefiddy_, too soon?

<y0wza>	rfc 2813 is good bedtime readin
<tortib>	RFC 1149 is a pretty good read
<tortib>	http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1149.html
<pingfloyd>	rfcs tend to lag behind innovation and hence why defacto standards tend to be more pervasive
<tortib>	ROFL
<tortib>	LAG BEHIND INNOVATION
<tortib>	oh man that's good pingfloyd
<tortib>	yeah because httpd has changed soooo much
<tortib>	same with SMTP and IMAP/POP
<tortib>	over the past 20 years they have changed so much!
<AnTi_MTtr>	PPP!
<pingfloyd>	that's pretty innovative stuff there
<pingfloyd>	nice straw man
<tortib>	mofugga
<duckgoose>	http should be deprecated
<tortib>	yeah, we should use gopher instead
<sunstar>	PPTP!
<AnTi_MTtr>	screw PPP lets go back to SLIP!
<pingfloyd>	another nice straw man
<tortib>	I prefer BNC
<sunstar>	i like SLIP
<pingfloyd>	you probably haven't even used gopher before
<duckgoose>	those all suck
<tortib>	I forge each bit by hand, using a anvil and a hammer.
*	AnTi_MTtr remembers using gofer
<tortib>	pingfloyd, lol yes, I have.
*	AnTi_MTtr is glad he doesnt have to anymore
<tortib>	I've been on the internet longer than you have probably been born.
<AnTi_MTtr>	gopher really sucked, just content wise
<duckgoose>	in todays networking age any protocol that submits personal information should be encrypted by default
<AnTi_MTtr>	otherwise it was just like using links browser today
<sunstar>	i've been on the internet before there was an internet
<tortib>	also TCP/IP soooo outdated
<pingfloyd>	tortib: it's more like a search
<tortib>	should totally use IPX
<sunstar>	(no im not that old. i just used a lot of old crap long after it went obsolete)
<AnTi_MTtr>	and SPX!
<AnTi_MTtr>	dont forget spx
<tortib>	because ya know...RFCs lag behind innovation
<duckgoose>	tortib you're a nutter
<hubik>	so we're all in a corridor?
<AnTi_MTtr>	screw it lets DO IT IN TOKEN RING!
<sunstar>	how to replace tcp/ip?
<bazhang>	appletalk:enabled
<tortib>	the only token rings I'm going to use is if it involves weed
<sunstar>	the ENTIRE internet on token ring
<AnTi_MTtr>	lets just move the internet into a long daisy chain of serial nullmodem cables
<tortib>	SONET is over 10 years old!  SCRAP IT!
<sunstar>	^
<bazhang>	its a series of tubes
<pingfloyd>	tortib: rfcs have defined gopher quite well
<AnTi_MTtr>	and everyone knows serial null modem cables > tubes!
<AnTi_MTtr>	screw tubes!
<pingfloyd>	tortib: two can play your straw man game
<duckgoose>	tortib you sarcasm makes babies cry
<sunstar>	aside from uefi has there actually been any real changes to computers in the last decade?
<tortib>	pingfloyd, it isn't a game dude, i'm right you're wrong.
<duckgoose>	tortib you should realize 10 years in computing is a long ass time
<y0wza>	erryone got oc768 in ther backyard
<pingfloyd>	tortib: in blog theory?
<tortib>	duckgoose, by who's standards?
<pingfloyd>	I can live with that
<sunstar>	the world
<duckgoose>	tortib by a sane mans standards
<AnTi_MTtr>	i got one only in my front yard y0wza :/
<tortib>	heh
<Audioburn_work>	swag
<tortib>	If 10 years is a 'long time in computing' then why are we using protocols written int he 80s and 90s?
<y0wza>	cus the kids man
<tortib>	oh that's right
<AnTi_MTtr>	heh
<ceil>	tortib: you think you can do better than tcp/ip?
<tortib>	because you have no idea what you're talking about
<tortib>	I always forget that.
<duckgoose>	tortib do you still use IE6
<tortib>	silly me.
<sunstar>	even the weakest noobs who cant find the start menu know a decade ago is ancient history in computing
<tortib>	no I use Netscape
<tortib>	get it right.
<ceil>	80s/90s protocols ftw
<y0wza>	ehehe
<ceil>	lol
<pingfloyd>	10 years in computing is like 5+ of your generations
<AnTi_MTtr>	screw that newfangled netscape, lets go back to mosiac!
<duckgoose>	tortib thats why you can't tell a difference from now and the internet 10 years ago then :P
<sunstar>	aside from uefi has there actually been any real changes to computers in the last decade?
<tortib>	duckgoose, I can tell the difference :)
<bazhang>	yes
<AnTi_MTtr>	duckgoose: well my rates are the same
<y0wza>	internet 10 years ago felt way diffrnt
<AnTi_MTtr>	duckgoose: its only the websites that have gotten fancier
<bazhang>	unity shell on ubuntu
<pingfloyd>	tortib: your great great great grandfather told me you suck at computers
<sunstar>	oh yeah
<sunstar>	unity
<tortib>	duckgoose, hardware has become better, but the software is the same crap, same ideaology.
<ceil>	sunstar: SLI and APU are <10yrs old ain't they?
<AnTi_MTtr>	sli?
<AnTi_MTtr>	no
<AnTi_MTtr>	sli was around in the 90s
<tortib>	pingfloyd, yeah, I do. so?
<ceil>	AnTi_MTtr: oh wow
<tortib>	pingfloyd, He used an abacus, he was pro.
<y0wza>	ther been lott of advances in the past 10 years u jus dont see it yet
<ceil>	thought it was a mid-2000s thing
<sunstar>	i was using something similar to SLI when i had three 24MB Voodoo2's
<AnTi_MTtr>	voodoo 2 was the first sli card
<AnTi_MTtr>	afaik
<duckgoose>	10 years ago everything could be hacked by XSRF
<pingfloyd>	tortib: because they're selling quantum computers at radio shack
<duckgoose>	things are improving
<y0wza>	u wont need to
<tortib>	pingfloyd, wtf really?
<tortib>	u trollin' brah?
<ceil>	pingfloyd: radioshack exists?
<AnTi_MTtr>	sunstar: yeah voodoo2 was the debut of sli
<AnTi_MTtr>	might not have called it that but thats what it was
<ceil>	AnTi_MTtr: ah, neat
<pingfloyd>	tortib: it's sarcasm about your metrics
<Eclipse>	hi.
<penguin1263>	...
<ceil>	what about APUs?
<AnTi_MTtr>	outside of industrial cards i mean
<tortib>	OOOOOO I C WUT U DID DER!
<pingfloyd>	ceil: yes, unfortunately
<AnTi_MTtr>	the high end graphics station cards had it first
<AnTi_MTtr>	but voodoo2 was definately hte first consumer grade gaming focused sli
<pingfloyd>	ceil: ever read what some of the people that have worked at them have to say?
<ceil>	pingfloyd: wrt APUs?
<tortib>	SLI is a total gimmick today
<ceil>	i know mine is a disappointment
<pingfloyd>	ceil: Radio Shacks
<tortib>	back when voodo2 had it it actually DID help.
<AnTi_MTtr>	i enver cared for sli
<ceil>	oh
<AnTi_MTtr>	i think having more screens is way cooler than slightly faster framerates in COD
<tortib>	but now if you buy SLI you're just a complete sucker.
<ceil>	pingfloyd: heh friend of mine actually seemed to like his job there... before they closed his store : p
<Audioburn_work>	butts?
<Audioburn_work>	buuts
<duckgoose>	the RFC spec for IRC doesn't even have namesx

<sunstar>	you would if you had a diamond video card on the PCI bus
<pingfloyd>	they love shills
<AnTi_MTtr>	pingfloyd: when i was getting into robotics last year i found my local radioshack very handy
<jenni>	that's not a color. Pick a color.
<penguin1263>	why does gnu's shell have to be called bash
<sunstar>	aquaclear!
<AnTi_MTtr>	sure the folks there dont know much about the electronics they sell, but they can still be helfpul
<tortib>	radio shack isn't that bad, they're more expensive though.
<penguin1263>	why dont i bash some dicks
<treefiddy_>	jenni my favorite color is rainbow
<tortib>	pingfloyd, use zsh, problem solved.
<AnTi_MTtr>	tortib: right its the instant gratifacation vs low price tradeoff
<sunstar>	aquaclear!
<tortib>	zsh is superior imo
<pingfloyd>	I bet you can climb to the top off radio shack battery club subscriptions sold
<duckgoose>	radio shack is deprecated
<AnTi_MTtr>	i think for cheap things radioshack works fine
<Eclipse>	hi friends
<tortib>	AnTi_MTtr, yeah exactly, if you're order parts in bulk mouser is probably a better solution.
<jenni>	Rainbow isn't neccesarily a cover
<duckgoose>	going out to stores is deprecated
<tortib>	lol
<tortib>	it really is

<AnTi_MTtr>	though you wouldnt be going to radioshack fo rthat
<AnTi_MTtr>	youd be going to frys

<pingfloyd>	sunstar: that's radio shack
<ceil>	sunstar: sounds about right : p
<AnTi_MTtr>	cant adapt s-video?

<AnTi_MTtr>	its great for resistors
<AnTi_MTtr>	and capacitors
<Audioburn_work>	pingfloyd, its not 1999 anymore
<Audioburn_work>	thats why
<ceil>	duckgoose: i think amazon ships everywhere in the US
<AnTi_MTtr>	also get some enclosures for my arduino projects there

<AnTi_MTtr>	duckgoose: its more like $1-2 for a pack of 10
<penguin1263>	sudo su

<ceil>	i didn't know coca-cola made protein shakes
<ceil>	though i do enjoy their Surge soda at lunch : )
<prison_>	they still make surge?
<ceil>	yeh, only sold through Amazon
<ceil>	like $40 a case unless you get it in a pantry box, then it's only like $16

<redlegion>	oO
<coldsparrow>	is that an angry face you're making?
<redlegion>	last i checked, i'm not a catholic priest
<redlegion>	more "wtf" than anything
<coldsparrow>	who said anything about catholic priests? are you trying to change the subject?
<redlegion>	well, no, you made some accusation
<redlegion>	not sure the motivation behind it
<coldsparrow>	if yous ay so
<redlegion>	ooookaaaay
<coldsparrow>	haha
<coldsparrow>	you're right dude, i cannot even touch you
<redlegion>	well, i mean, if you got to know me i could give you all sorts of ammunition about me being a jerk and a slob
<coldsparrow>	and a pedo
<redlegion>	that's a new one to me

<redlegion>	my friend, allow me to introduce you to antipsychotics
*	coldsparrow waits
<redlegion>	here we have zyprexa
<coldsparrow>	snorted it.
<coldsparrow>	took it orally for 2 years
<sabotender>	moo 🐮
<coldsparrow>	what else
<coldsparrow>	hello sabotender
<sabotender>	greetings
<tortib>	🐄 Moo
<coldsparrow>	let go
<redlegion>	coldsparrow: do you randomly pick people to accuse of heinous shit?
<coldsparrow>	redlegion, no
<sabotender>	im currently watching robot overlords
<redlegion>	i'm at a loss, then
<sabotender>	is it any good?
<redlegion>	i don't know what the fuck you're talking about, coldsparrow
<coldsparrow>	redlegion, than
<sabotender>	tortib: so have you seen it?
<tortib>	no
<tortib>	I have lived it though
<tortib>	lol
<coldsparrow>	redlegion, why dont you call me by my name
<diogenese>	I was thinking that.
<tortib>	diogenese, o/
<redlegion>	chuck?
<sabotender>	lol soon tortib and i will be able to get married in any state within the united states :-P
<diogenese>	Hi tortib
<coldsparrow>	chuck fuck.
<tortib>	sabotender, uhhh, why soon?  Aren't you always allowed to get married within the states?
<tortib>	sabotender, oh wait are you one of them gays?
<pingfloyd>	now you see the subtext
<sabotender>	'one of them'
*	sabotender chuckles
<tortib>	I'm not gay
<tortib>	but if you're a gay woman, that's cool
<sabotender>	close, i'm bi, but that's not the point
<tortib>	I'll marry ya
<sabotender>	i'm just saying it would be possible
<pingfloyd>	"one of them thar..."
<pingfloyd>	I think you just found the south
<tortib>	lol
<diogenese>	I haven't read the news. Did they decide?
<tortib>	I was born and raised in AZ
<sabotender>	pingfloyd: yeah I noticed it too
<sabotender>	diogenese: you have about two or so months until that time comes
<sabotender>	but the oral arguments for those against SSM is pretty ridiculous
<diogenese>	It's in the news a bunch. Didn't know how far they were on that.
<sabotender>	is/are
<tortib>	what is SSM?
<Equinoxdawg>	single sex marriage
<sabotender>	they are pretty laughable
<sabotender>	Equinoxdawg: EXACTLY! You win the internetz
<Equinoxdawg>	ty
<tortib>	sabotender, what did he win?
<coldsparrow>	your soul
<sabotender>	the internetz
<tortib>	lol jokes on him I sold that shit to the devil years ago
<sabotender>	tortib: why am I not surprised?
<tortib>	good gravy I am so full, that smoothie really hit the spot
<tortib>	I want my EV certificate damnit
<tortib>	so much waiting :/
<sabotender>	diogenese: there are so many religious organisations stating that they will 'not obey' and civil disobedience or sommat when the supreme court rules in favour of SSM
<sabotender>	that really doesnt make any sense, because all churches have the right to refuse to minister a SS wedding
<sabotender>	I think they just have their britches in a twist because they can't control society to how they like it. Its high time they are shown that they were never in control to begin with.
<pingfloyd>	consider the source, you're talking about an organization that being gay is only okay when it involves little children
<sabotender>	pingfloyd: fair point
<pingfloyd>	hard to put much credence on that insane logic
<tortib>	who said it was logic?
<diogenese>	Logic and religion don't mix well.
<pingfloyd>	it's logical to a nutcase like them
<tortib>	I would agree that it's an agenda, but far from logic.
<diogenese>	If she weighs as much as a duck, must be a witch.
<tortib>	She turned me into a newt!
<tortib>	I got better...
<sabotender>	mmm fig newtons
<tortib>	sabotender, :\
<diogenese>	Yum
<dw1>	footons
<dw1>	jk
<tortib>	feets
<sabotender>	I have some, they are very tasty
<sabotender>	tortib: remember froot by the foot?
<tortib>	yep
<sabotender>	om nom nom
<dw1>	fruit roll up > fbtf
<sabotender>	mmmm
<tortib>	I think I have only eaten a fruit by the foot once in my life
<tortib>	maybe twice
<sabotender>	what????
<dw1>	note to self: get boxes of fruit roll ups
<coldsparrow>	dw1, remember when they first started putting cut-out shapes in them?
<tortib>	dude it's plastic
<sabotender>	I had one of those in my bento/lunch box every day growing up
<dw1>	coldsparrow: not exactly but yea
<sabotender>	I remember that
<sabotender>	and you got to peel them out
<coldsparrow>	yeah
<coldsparrow>	sabotender, are you a robot?
<dw1>	i didt care much for it
<dw1>	i preferred to wrap them around my finger
<dw1>	lol
<diogenese>	I've never tried them.
<coldsparrow>	dw1, that shit gets stuck in your teeth
<sabotender>	and then they released the tie dye looking ones
<sabotender>	coldsparrow: what? no i am not a robot O_o
<coldsparrow>	hehe
<coldsparrow>	ok
<coldsparrow>	just checking
<coldsparrow>	:P
<sabotender>	why? do I sound like a bot or something?
<coldsparrow>	no
<sabotender>	you're weird lol

<coldsparrow>	what does yoru nick mean, btw?
<sabotender>	I'm a rare mooing cactus

<sabotender>	have you seen it
<coldsparrow>	seen...it?
<sabotender>	its a movie

<Mapleyy>	Hey, is it just me or am I getting a "program cannot be displayed" error on this page/can't load the video? ("Programmet går inte att spela upp", that is) http://www.svtplay.se/kanaler/svt1
<coldsparrow>	sabotender, the bookw as better
<Mapleyy>	I know it isn't a geo-block, so...
<azizLIGHT>	whats wrong with self signed certificates. why do i get warned about them? isnt it better for them to be self signed
<sabotender>	azizLIGHT: because they cant be trused
<coldsparrow>	azizLIGHT, no
<sabotender>	unknown souurce
<diogenese>	I forged a signed one. It can't be trusted either.
<azizLIGHT>	sabotender: well the ones cas give, are those more trustable than someone i know personally giving me their cert on a flash drive
<y0wza>	badusb
<azizLIGHT>	ok, sftp
<y0wza>	lmao
<azizLIGHT>	what
<sabotender>	mmm
<y0wza>	ull be alrite man
<azizLIGHT>	am just wondering
<y0wza>	more than likely
<tortib>	because anyone can assign themselves a certificate
<tortib>	unless it's signed by the Certificate mafia...I mean Certificate Authority then it's considered 'untrusted'
<azizLIGHT>	so if i know its signed by the person i want, then its good to use those, right?
<azizLIGHT>	self signed ones
<tortib>	if you trust that person yea
<tortib>	it's still encrypted
<artwoodwork>	goddamn lightroom rules
<tortib>	the only thing that self-signed means is that it isn't signed by a CA
<azizLIGHT>	tortib: isnt this how the gpg stuff works?
<y0wza>	im more of a darkroom kinda dude
<tortib>	no gpg is completely different.
<tortib>	but it's similar
<azizLIGHT>	hm ok
<y0wza>	but literoom is pret badass
<artwoodwork>	http://i.imgur.com/hVsbudE.png
<sabotender>	ah I love freshly washed hair :-D
<tortib>	azizLIGHT, gpg doesn't have a central authority
<y0wza>	such touch up
<azizLIGHT>	is that an adobe product
<artwoodwork>	yep
<tortib>	yea
*	datasmurf2 is now known as datasmurf

<artwoodwork>	search for Midget with a dog
<artwoodwork>	you won't be let down
<coldsparrow>	artwoodwork, you're annoying.
<y0wza>	update ur xcode guys its time to swift
<artwoodwork>	coldsparrow, good.
<artwoodwork>	edgy handle
<coldsparrow>	artwoodwork, umad
<artwoodwork>	sorry, i'm not mad at all!
<Majellico>	They call me Michael Vick
<Majellico>	Because after a hot summer's day
<Majellico>	I like to go back to my house
<Majellico>	and break my dog's neck
<azizLIGHT>	where do i begin to learn to code? what should i learn? where from?
<Majellico>	http://bit.ly/ustPaD good site.
<azizLIGHT>	which language, theres so many
<Majellico>	to get started, C++
<Majellico>	or Python
<azizLIGHT>	can you make gui programs with those, or are they only used on command prompts
<azizLIGHT>	like bash
<Majellico>	You want to go right into GUIs
<azizLIGHT>	is that a question?
<Majellico>	eee.... Visual basics is usually mixed
<Majellico>	with other code.
<azizLIGHT>	what about android apps, what are those made of?
<azizLIGHT>	whats more versatile like that
<Majellico>	Java
<azizLIGHT>	so i can make android and pc programs
<Majellico>	Android Studios is a great start
<Majellico>	Java is a good language as well
<azizLIGHT>	can you learn it all online? im askin becaues i saw codeacademy recommended, but all it has is very basic stuff
<azizLIGHT>	like syntax and grammar... thats it
<Majellico>	Take online tutorials with little care
<Majellico>	Look for what you need to make what you want and master it on the way
<Mmango>	what are your opinions on pirating music
<Majellico>	I do it because I'm poor
<Majellico>	I plan on buying it later.
<azizLIGHT>	people will do whats easiest and most useful. if pirating is easier, and more portable device-wise. theyll do that. i use google play music all access, and its library is decent, so i dont have to pirate
<Majellico>	kek
<azizLIGHT>	i can use it on my pc, in my browser, on my phone
<Mmango>	that's cool. I'm just curious to see what people's reasons are
<Mmango>	The way I see it, it's no different than pirating games, and that's much less common
<Majellico>	I really want to support the artist
<azizLIGHT>	dont need to store large mp3s collections everywhere (especially my phone with no sdcard)
<Majellico>	But as a teen with no credit card and allowance
<Majellico>	eh
<azizLIGHT>	plus my carrier lets me stream it without costing data
<Skizzerz>	only time I've really pirated music is when it's either not available at all legitimately by me or is far too expensive (like $70+ for a soundtrack consisting of 15 or so tracks), otherwise legitimate sources like itunes are easy enough to browse and use that pirating generally takes more effort than simply buying the song, plus buying it lets you support the artist somewhat
<Skizzerz>	and in general, I think that people pirating anything (music, games, software, books, etc.) probably apply similar criteria. There are of course people who will always pirate everything and will never spend anything unless they have to, but in general I think people are not like that
<Equinoxdawg>	[14:51:48] <Majellico> Java is a good language as well
<Equinoxdawg>	You forgot the 'Script' on the end of that.
<Majellico>	kek
<azizLIGHT>	java is the one that needs that annoying thing to get updated all the time right
<Skizzerz>	for learning how to program, Java is perfectly fine
<Equinoxdawg>	no kek, not even lel
<azizLIGHT>	the jre
<Skizzerz>	imo it's far better to start with a strongly-typed language
<azizLIGHT>	whats a ... strongly typed language
<azizLIGHT>	vs a weakly typed one
<Skizzerz>	Java, C/C++, anything that has a notion of "types" for their variables
<Skizzerz>	versus python, javascript, etc. where any variable can be anything
<azizLIGHT>	where does perl fit in between those poles
<Skizzerz>	reason being is that learning how a type system works and it being forced on you requires you to think about types (which you have to do anyway in a loosely-typed language, but it's just more in-your-face here)
<Skizzerz>	plus the type system can catch many newbie mistakes
<Skizzerz>	perl is loosely-typed
<azizLIGHT>	is there like any comparison hierarchy youre basing this off of i can look at, in totality
<Skizzerz>	no
<Skizzerz>	they probably exist somewhere, though
<artwoodwork>	everything exists, somewhere
<artwoodwork>	anyone have a gopro?
<azizLIGHT>	ha, when i google which programming language to learn, google straight up tells me python
<coldsparrow>	no.
<Skizzerz>	but for starting off learning to program, my recommendation would be Java or C++, and leaning towards Java since the latter is... ugly. It'll make you good once you grasp it, but the learning curve is steep
<azizLIGHT>	hmm ok
<Skizzerz>	python is great to learn once you already know basic programming concepts, it is NOT a good teacher of them
<azizLIGHT>	i know a bit of bash
<Skizzerz>	yeah, that means little to nothing for actual programs :)
<azizLIGHT>	lol
<Skizzerz>	although some concepts still apply
<Skizzerz>	things like what variables are, calling methods/subroutines, loops, branching, etc. will all come into play for actual programming
<Skizzerz>	specific bash-isms to work around kinks will not, of course :)
<artwoodwork>	another exciting night on irc
<azizLIGHT>	hey man youre here artwoodwork
<azizLIGHT>	ofc its exciting

<azizLIGHT>	good/bad plan?

*	YonicWitch is now known as CosmicWitch
<artwoodwork>	"active" channel diogenese

<artwoodwork>	not at this time and day
<diogenese>	Yeah, usually quieter about this time of day. Europeans are sleeping.
<Equinoxdawg>	I always find #freenode to be a better place for offtopic chitchat at random times of the day.
<diogenese>	I was lurking in there for a while. The constant attacks got old.
<artwoodwork>	it's fun if you're bored at work and can access it
<Equinoxdawg>	diogenese: you mean the nick attempts?
<artwoodwork>	he likes the ping timeouts
<Equinoxdawg>	if yes, it hasn't happened in the last few weeks
<artwoodwork>	^
<artwoodwork>	see
<diogenese>	Not worried about that. It was the constant "OMG!!! Someone's trying to hack me!" that got old.
<tlt>	the recent giga failed-logins thing was a bug afaik
<tlt>	couple weeks ago
<tlt>	so they said anyways.
<artwoodwork>	why would someone hack a single person?
<artwoodwork>	this isn't the 90s
<artwoodwork>	they have a victim complex
<artwoodwork>	probably don't even know what "hack" means
<Equinoxdawg>	It wasn't a bug, it was Cholby.
<diogenese>	Not like a dictionary or brute force would work qith maybe a dozen attempts a day.
<artwoodwork>	"hacking" what? a facebook password?
<artwoodwork>	so haxxored
<artwoodwork>	omg look at me
<artwoodwork>	i'm a victim
<Equinoxdawg>	i hack my friends all the time, they leave there accounts logged in at my house xD
<diogenese>	He was attempting to log into everyone in the list. Failed of course, but like hitting a hornets nest sometimes.
<Equinoxdawg>	He actually got into accounts lol
<artwoodwork>	you're a 1337 haxor, Equinoxdawg

<artwoodwork>	raising donation for the CEO and donating 3%
<Fowler>	Not necessarily, klixa-cloud
<Fowler>	Not at all
<Fowler>	That's in a minority of cases
<artwoodwork>	most
<artwoodwork>	MOST
<treefiddy_>	moobs are a result of too much fat in the pants
<artwoodwork>	fuck donating
<klixa-cloud>	Fowler: it's what I heard
<Fowler>	klixa-cloud: It can be a cause, for things like gynecomastia
<klixa-cloud>	treefiddy_: too much fat is what causes the estrogen
<crimlo>	ok lets change the topic
<Fowler>	But if you're fat and have moobs you're probably just fat
<crimlo>	i'm about to cry
<Fowler>	It's not actual breast tissue
<Fowler>	It's not glandular tissue
<artwoodwork>	if you want to "donate" just actually do something to help people
<Fowler>	It's just fat
<klixa-cloud>	Fowler: being fat causes hormonal issues tho
<crimlo>	awwwww
<Fowler>	Anyone who gets fat enough will have moobs
<artwoodwork>	fucking grow up
<crimlo>	guys
<y0wza>	lmao that dale peterson
<Fowler>	klixa-cloud: Except it's not a hormonal issue
<Fowler>	It's simply fat storage
<y0wza>	good ol boy
<klixa-cloud>	Fowler: my stepfather was huge... no moobs
<Fowler>	klixa-cloud: Well he's in the minority then lol
<artwoodwork>	y0wza,  :)
<DoverMo>	klixa-cloud, no, not at all. moobs just depend on the body type .-. period
<klixa-cloud>	Fowler: it's cause he was manly!
<Fowler>	klixa-cloud: You can find plenty of strongment with moobs, you think they have low T?
<crimlo>	<----- crying his/her/it eyes out.
<klixa-cloud>	high e doesn't mean low t
<duckgoose>	:(
<Fowler>	klixa-cloud: It's all about the ratios
<Fowler>	High E plus high T doesn't make you feminine
<Fowler>	It's about balance, like you said
<Fowler>	Hormonal balance
<Fowler>	It hink you said that anyway
<treefiddy_>	whoremoans
<Fowler>	I think*
<treefiddy_>	gotta control those
<klixa-cloud>	Fowler: yeah I ne ruined imbalances
<Fowler>	wut

<Fowler>	Oh, well you should have

<klixa-cloud>	I h8 you jenni
<Fowler>	That's me
<tortib>	that flower looks like an asshole
<tortib>	so it suits you perfectly
<klixa-cloud>	Damnit tortib you stole my thoughts
<tortib>	yeah, I'll do that
<Fowler>	"Although the obese mean exhibited increased blood levels and production rates of estrogens, there were no signs of feminization, increased T-estrogen-binding, globulin levels, or suppressed basal gonadotropin levels, suggesting a lack of biological effect. We postulate that obese men exhibit defective estrogen receptors, leading to decreased T-estrogen-binding globulin, increased clearance of androgenic hormones, and elevated estrogen production rates"
<duckgoose>	http://blog.interflora.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/monkey-cup-pitcher-plant-21.jpg I always thought this flower kinda looked like a vagina
<duckgoose>	JS
<Fowler>	crap, long paste, sorry
<Fowler>	Also I'm getting super intense dejavu right now
<tortib>	it does look like a vagina
<tortib>	a tore up vagina
<artwoodwork>	yeah just stop being fat you idiots
<artwoodwork>	go to the gym everyday
<klixa-cloud>	Fowler: it's always estrogen related according to this http://chestsculpting.com/man-boobs-and-the-estrogen-testosterone-ratio/
<Fowler>	lol

<y0wza>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shCYA2J-De8
<y0wza>	man thas a good ol 1
<tortib>	has that ever occurred to you?
<tortib>	why don't you stop being skinny
<artwoodwork>	stop trying to be oppressed. everyone has weight issues and no one cares about you
<totem>	bazhang, sorry, is that you? http://www.graphics99.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/office-work.jpg
<tortib>	artwoodwork, oh and they care about you?
<tortib>	who the fuck are you?
<artwoodwork>	get off your fat ass and do something
<Fowler>	klixa-cloud: The problem is that most manboobs aren't breast tissue, they're just fat.
<Fowler>	The premise for this entire article is wrong
<artwoodwork>	my wife and child do tortib
<tortib>	artwoodwork, they probably don't
<tortib>	they probably hate you
<artwoodwork>	do yours?
<DoverMo>	artwoodwork, not sure if sarcasm or genuine a-hole
<artwoodwork>	oh
<tortib>	I'm not stupid enough to have a wife
<artwoodwork>	you don't have that and never will
<tortib>	hah yeah
<tortib>	because you can tell the future right?
<tortib>	you have a crystal ball?
<tortib>	If I wanted a woman I would get one but why bother, they're as obnoxious as you.
<artwoodwork>	sure. how old and fat are you?
<tortib>	old enough to be your father
<artwoodwork>	60?
<tortib>	no 80 dude
<klixa-cloud>	Fowler: none of what I have seen mentions breast tissue... I will have to look more into it
<artwoodwork>	whatever makes you feel good bro
<Fowler>	klixa-cloud: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/429508
<tortib>	artwoodwork, same to you
<Fowler>	Wait
<Fowler>	That is from 1979 lol
<Fowler>	Either way, you also have to take into account more than how much of each hormone is there
<y0wza>	hoo
<Fowler>	You have to take into account how it's interacting with the person's body
<klixa-cloud>	Fowler: I saw a nutrition documentary awhile ago which is where I heard about estrogen and man boobs
<Fowler>	It's pretty complicated shit really
<Fowler>	klixa-cloud: I'm usually pretty weary of nutrition documentaries
<artwoodwork>	yeah running for a few minutes a day it really hard
<treefiddy_>	im going to go take an estrogen suppliment to see what happens
<Fowler>	Why would you run instead of lifting weights?
<tortib>	artwoodwork, using proper sentence structure, also very difficult.
<tortib>	for you.
<Fowler>	Also forming any new habit is hard
<artwoodwork>	i'm totally drunk on irc and in infinite better shape than you'll ever be tortib
<klixa-cloud>	treefiddy_: you'll get moody like DoverMo and call me dumbxa
<tortib>	artwoodwork, yeah because you actually give a shit.
<tortib>	artwoodwork, you're a try hard.
<treefiddy_>	i do that anyway!
<artwoodwork>	yeah I have a family
<tortib>	You want a fucking medal?
<klixa-cloud>	treefiddy_: oh, yeah true... nm
<tortib>	Tons of people have families
<artwoodwork>	get mad
<artwoodwork>	do it
<tortib>	you're not doing anything extravagant or special
<tortib>	I'm not mad at all bro
<artwoodwork>	right lol
<artwoodwork>	it shows
<y0wza>	get glad bro
<tortib>	Well apparently you're terrible at reading people.
<y0wza>	cus they came out wit a new
<y0wza>	zip loc bag
<y0wza>	with a differently foldy thing
<tortib>	and you can't really show anger over the internet unless you type in all caps.
<tortib>	which signifies yelling
<DoverMo>	y0wza, whoa O:
<artwoodwork>	ok well...
<artwoodwork>	good argument i guess
<tortib>	artwoodwork, you're new it's cool man.
<tortib>	you'll learn
<tortib>	hell i'll even teach you
<tortib>	because you need an education
<tortib>	it's good for you to learn
<klixa-cloud>	eh anger can be shown w/o all caps
<tortib>	how so?
<artwoodwork>	ok thanks internet schleb
<treefiddy_>	i.think.i.could.show.anger.without.caps.
<tortib>	maybe if someone uses foul language, yeah I could understand that.
<artwoodwork>	i'll just wait by my wife, kid and career for you to help me out of this
<treefiddy_>	good thing it's not up to you!
<hellyeah>	treefiddy_:  what is "." for?
<klixa-cloud>	tortib: "I hope you die" is angry even with no caps
<tortib>	artwoodwork, what career?
<tortib>	artwoodwork, mcdonalds isn't a career
<artwoodwork>	take it to PM please tortib
<treefiddy_>	toodle ooo. have fun playing in traffic
<tortib>	I don't want to pm you
<Fowler>	If anyone here sounds mad it's artwoodwork
<artwoodwork>	if you really want to know
<tortib>	I don't care about you artwoodwork
<tortib>	I never have and I never will.
<artwoodwork>	so sad
<Fowler>	Why is that sad?
<tortib>	That's reality
<klixa-cloud>	biggest issue with text is lack of tone... I'm often being silly but people think I'm being literal
<klixa-cloud>	I need to use more emoticons
<tortib>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<artwoodwork>	I again offer you to PM me
<Fowler>	klixa-cloud: Same. People think I'm mad all the time just because I keep an argument going
<tortib>	artwoodwork, get over yourself dude.
<Fowler>	As if I have to be mad to keep an argument going
<artwoodwork>	instead of trolling on your moms Uverse account
<tortib>	hahaha
<Equinoxdawg>	mom jokes = mad
<klixa-cloud>	Fowler: I like arguments about ideas
<tortib>	oh man this kid
<tortib>	he's good
<tortib>	threw out a mom joke
<treefiddy_>	dude get off my mom. i just got off yours
<tortib>	man I haven't heard a good mom joke since I was in like...hmmm 7th grade?
<treefiddy_>	oh sick burn
<klixa-cloud>	Fowler: I don't like when people take them personally tho
<tortib>	yeah I think back in the 90s mom jokes were relevant
<treefiddy_>	apply water to burned area
<artwoodwork>	so like last year?
<Fowler>	klixa-cloud: I like all kinds of arguments. Arguments with actual substance are enjoyable for obvious reasons, arguments where people make things personal or where the other person just can't present or follow a reasonable argument or when they're just woefully ignorant of what they're talking about are just funny
<tortib>	nah two years ago
<artwoodwork>	so you're admittedly in 9th grade
<Fowler>	wut
<artwoodwork>	no one is surprised
<hellyeah>	you guys are typin fast
<Equinoxdawg>	artwoodwork: does your family help you come up with insults
<tortib>	yeah dude, i'm so serious.
<tortib>	artwoodwork, ask your wife for new insults because you're lacking in that department.
<Fowler>	artwoodwork: I admit I'm in 9th grade
<tortib>	maybe she can help you out
<Fowler>	Does that mean I am?
<klixa-cloud>	Fowler: personal arguments all boil down to "yer dumb" "nuh uh yer dumb"
<treefiddy_>	no u
<Fowler>	klixa-cloud: When the other person starts insulting me I just ask them why they're so mad and what they want to accomplish
<Fowler>	To keep them going as long as I can
<Fowler>	It's pretty fun
<artwoodwork>	so where do you guys have jobs?
<artwoodwork>	...
<Fowler>	artwoodwork: It's a secret
<artwoodwork>	...
<artwoodwork>	...
<tortib>	he thinks because someone is fat they're an idiot lol
<Fowler>	Wow much ellipses
<artwoodwork>	...
<klixa-cloud>	Fowler: depends on my mood
<Fowler>	artwoodwork: ...
<hellyeah>	DAMN
<tortib>	or if someone doesn't have a job, obviously an idiot.
<artwoodwork>	no where. got it.
<Equinoxdawg>	artwoodwork: I ask again, does your family help? If not, might be worth asking for help.
<tortib>	artwoodwork, I own my own business.
<artwoodwork>	no they never have
<artwoodwork>	sorry
<Fowler>	lol

<Fowler>	artwoodwork: So you won't answer in the channel but you expect other people to, and if they don't it means they don't have jobs
<klixa-cloud>	I don't have a job , cause I refuse to be an appendage to the machine
<Fowler>	artwoodwork: Hypocrite
<artwoodwork>	you're a bad troll Fowler
<Fowler>	I'm not trolilng
<artwoodwork>	sorry man
<Fowler>	trolling*
<tortib>	My business has had 50000% growth since I started
<Fowler>	artwoodwork: That's exactly what happened
<tortib>	And I haven't even been open a full year yet.
<Fowler>	You told someone to take it to PM when they asked about you, then you turn it around on the channel
<Fowler>	You're a hypocrite
<artwoodwork>	i don't care tortib
*	klixa-cloud is barefoot and pregnant
<artwoodwork>	sorry you're nothing
<coldsparrow>	greet Fowler
<Fowler>	artwoodwork: Why are you asking, then?
<tortib>	artwoodwork, hahaha
<Fowler>	If you don't care?

<tortib>	crimlo, no, go back to what you were doing
<crimlo>	damn, ok
<Fowler>	coldsparrow: Payday doesn't even have nougat
<coldsparrow>	Fowler, what does it have?
<Fowler>	Peanuts and caramel
<hmir>	Smoochiers!
<coldsparrow>	i believe they do have this nougat yous peak of

<Fowler>	See
<DF3D2>	Oy vey that boys gay
<DF3D2>	payday is nasty
<DF3D2>	snickers for eva
<Fowler>	coldsparrow: I mean, they are pretty similar since salted nut rolls just have nougat, but they taste real different
<tortib>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exOxUAntx8I
<coldsparrow>	Fowler, i can see how they migh taste different
<Fowler>	I think it's coconut nougat
<coldsparrow>	in the nut roll?
<Fowler>	Yeah
<Fowler>	I definitely like salted nut rolls more, the taste and texture
<Fowler>	Maybe a little more chewy
<coldsparrow>	i've never been too sure of just what exactly nougat is, but i know payday has something chewy in the middle that isnt caramel
<hellyeah>	iis it time to make a change
<hellyeah>	i wişll closer than before
<hellyeah>	can we have them break away
<coldsparrow>	stfu
<hellyeah>	it is time to make a CHANGE !!!!
<coldsparrow>	if you cant make sense dont bother logging on to irc
<Fowler>	coldsparrow: I don't think it does
<coldsparrow>	Fowler, im sure
*	hellyeah mind your bussines :XXD
<Fowler>	I realize you are, but I think you're mistaken
<coldsparrow>	unless they make em different p north
<coldsparrow>	anyway. i dont care
<Fowler>	Nope
<Fowler>	Same everywhere

*	eir removes channel operator status from eir
<coldsparrow>	man i was gonna go to bed but i had a cup of strong coffee and now im awake again
<Fowler>	Also nougat is just a chewy candy, often with nuts and fruit, with lower water content and that's aerated
<Fowler>	Real similar to taffy
<Fowler>	And egg
<Fowler>	And milk, maybe? Maybe
<coldsparrow>	dunno
<Fowler>	Definitely sugar and fruit/nuts and egg whites and whipped
*	coldsparrow scratches his ballz.
*	tortib scratches his beard
<coldsparrow>	you have a beard tortib
<coldsparrow>	?
<tortib>	yep
<klixa-cloud>	tmi
<treefiddy_>	they're very similar
<coldsparrow>	wild,
<tortib>	it's growing in pretty well
<Fowler>	coldsparrow: Maybe it's just caramel flavored nougat
<Fowler>	In payday
<tortib>	i have a bald spot right under my chin though
<tortib>	but it's being covered up now
<coldsparrow>	Fowler, could be
<Fowler>	I can't actually remember eating one
<Fowler>	So iunno
<coldsparrow>	i eat them fairly often
<Fowler>	But the wrapper just says it's peanuts and caramel
<treefiddy_>	payday is regular nougat iirc
<coldsparrow>	dont believe everything you read
<coldsparrow>	:P
<Fowler>	treefiddy_: Definitely not just regular nougat
<treefiddy_>	the caramel is holding the peanuts together
<hellyeah>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYpNZwF0vMk
<Fowler>	You can tell that just from the pictures
<treefiddy_>	well carmel is just sugar
<tortib>	wtf it's like 80F in here
<treefiddy_>	heated a certain way
<tortib>	gawd dayum

<Fowler>	A mass spectrometer?
<treefiddy_>	a mass spectrometer but it works in like 2 minutes
<Fowler>	lolno
<treefiddy_>	haha
<Fowler>	coldsparrow: I'm finding conflicting sources
<Fowler>	But most say no nougat, just caramel
<Fowler>	You can have caramel with lots of different consistencies
<treefiddy_>	you might be right
<treefiddy_>	could be a caramel center, rolled in peanuts

<treefiddy_>	then crumble the meat and place into beans
<Fowler>	from*
<treefiddy_>	the important part is the burger meat sitting around all day
<klixa-cloud>	treefiddy_: :p lol
<Fowler>	Stew tomatoes with garlic and onion and cumin and paprika and chili powder and bay leaf, and even some cinnamon if I'm feeling special
<norkle>	cold burgers.

<tortib>	You ever have that moment in your life where you realize your completely screwed?
<caselogic>	nah
<caselogic>	you're not screwed.
<tortib>	I can't be the only one
<DoverMo>	tortib, did you release something on wikileaks?
<tortib>	no
<hhmmm>	weehee i found my tiniest screwdriver
<DoverMo>	tortib, maybe it's because, people actually want to screw over others completely
<tortib>	DoverMo, yea
<hhmmm>	mamma mia
<tortib>	DoverMo, how the hell do people survive if everyone is constantly screwing each other over?
<tortib>	I know some work in groups
<ceil>	tortib: people get together to screw over others
<ceil>	: )
<tortib>	yeah
<tortib>	pretty fucked up
<DoverMo>	tortib, we're all hypocrites, just somtimes less than others
<hhmmm>	coming here often makes me more depressed
<ceil>	hhmmm: you don't troll enough
<caselogic>	petroll
<hhmmm>	yanks are pretty fucking cynical
<tortib>	DoverMo, I guess I could always attempt to start my own group
<tortib>	but once again it's hard to trust those people
<tortib>	plus I don't think they want to be involved with me
<DoverMo>	tortib, good idea O:
<ceil>	keep your enemies closer
<caselogic>	for the most part i work to screw people over all by myself.
<tortib>	DoverMo, I do have allies though
<n0lan>	im gonna go lay down yo
<n0lan>	peace out homie tortib #AGOG
<tortib>	cya
<DoverMo>	tortib, you have to accomplish work somehow. can't have everyone giving their 2 cents
<tortib>	DoverMo, yea
<tortib>	DoverMo, I have my own business
<tortib>	so i am starting to do something for myself now
<DoverMo>	rebooot
<tortib>	DoverMo, although, accomplishing work is quite difficult especially when nobody wants to pay you for your work.
*	hhmmm gets boots
<DoverMo>	tortib, yeah O:
<hhmmm>	work done = force x distance
<tortib>	DoverMo, and since nobody wants to really pay me, it's quite difficult to see a bright future.
<DoverMo>	hhmmm, moving a box counts as work
<tortib>	Eventually I am going to be homeless :(
<DoverMo>	tortib, oh. what about being a teacher?
<tortib>	I don't have a masters degree
<funkentelechrxp>	just remember famous people have to take shits, too
<tortib>	what does taking a shit have to do with this conversation?
<DoverMo>	tortib, do you need one?
<tortib>	DoverMo, knowledge wise, no.
<ceil>	shitting is always relevant
<hmir>	I like to shit.
<hhmmm>	it loses it's shine when you do it all the time
<hhmmm>	g'day hmir :)
<DoverMo>	tortib, i dunno, don't go for a masters unless it's the only option
<tortib>	DoverMo, well I really don't know what else to do at this point.
<tortib>	I would like my business to succeed
<pingfloyd>	did you narfel the garthok?
<hmir>	hi hhmmm
<hmir>	wanna hug?
<hhmmm>	i would but no
<hhmmm>	thanks :D
<Butt3rfly>	mmm, eggs toast and tea
<tortib>	DoverMo, I don't really want to go to college, I don't want to pay to have someone potentially fail me.
<sheep>	tortib: that's why you pay attention in class and don't procrastinate on the assignments
<hmir>	=(
<tortib>	sheep, that has nothing to do with it now.
<tortib>	Some people will just fail you for no reason at all.
<sheep>	tortib: the one professor who did something like that to me got fired
<tortib>	sheep, I'm glad to hear that.
<sheep>	if a professor fails someone for no reason, that's usually not allowed
<sheep>	the department heads and deans don't like it when that happens
<sheep>	at a reputable college, anyway
<ceil>	cos they lose tens of thousands of dollars in tuition
<sheep>	ceil: that's why you don't go to for-profit colleges
<ceil>	aren't they all?
<tortib>	yep
<sheep>	no
<tortib>	heh
<ceil>	lol
<sheep>	state colleges aren't
<tortib>	they're all for profit dude
<tortib>	LOL
<tortib>	especially state colleges!
<ceil>	last i checked UNT is still pretty expensive
<sheep>	tortib: source?
<sheep>	ceil: blame the lack of funding by the state
<ceil>	Texas would never skimp on education!
<ceil>	*cough*
<sheep>	Texas is doing better on public education than higher education
<ceil>	http://financialaid.unt.edu/2015-2016-academic-year-traditional
<ceil>	$20kish/yr : (
<ceil>	or semester
<ceil>	or something, i dunno, i never went to college
<ceil>	i'm thinking year, and 'semester' is just mentioned to differentiate grad/under-grad
<sheep>	that's total cost of attendance with personal expenses and room and board included
<ceil>	still, my salary's about $26k at 40 hours per week
<ceil>	sheep: that all counts as cost of going to school
<sheep>	the in-state tuition is cheap though
<sheep>	and the room and board fees assume you live on campus and have a meal plan
<ceil>	tf is "board tuition"?
<ceil>	oh
<sheep>	not sure
<sheep>	they have a separate "room and board" line
<hhmmm>	la planche
<ceil>	room and board is a weird cost for UNT, as there's a lot of 'room' in walking distance to the school
<hhmmm>	gimme breakfast
<tortib>	nobody gives a shit if you have a degree
<tortib>	sorry to break the news to you all
<hhmmm>	i do
<hhmmm>	uneducated teachers for example are really annoying
<sheep>	tortib: all of the job descriptions I see for my field require a bachelor's degree
<ceil>	still, *just* looking at tuition, board tuition (whatever that is), and textbooks, $8,588/yr would be about a third of my full-time $13/hr wages
<ceil>	school is costly, even at a state college
<tortib>	sheep, I hope the best for you, but they don't care if you have a BS.  They want to 'know' you.
<DoverMo>	hhmmm, report to the dean O:
<ceil>	sheep: they require a degree to not simply throw your resume in the trash
<ceil>	doesn't mean you'll get the job, or be seriously considered
<hhmmm>	unqualified architects can be a pain too
<sheep>	tortib: everything in this field needs either a BS or 5 years of experience
<ceil>	it's a screening thing
<hhmmm>	how yanks manage to do plumbing in inches i'll never know
<tortib>	I have over 10 years of experience working on linux and PHP/JS/CSS web development
<DoverMo>	every city needs funded a hiring center
<crimlo>	wrong
<sheep>	tortib: but you started before the current tech bubble
<tortib>	sheep, but yet I can't land a sys admin job.
<ceil>	hhmmm: why would it be technically more difficult than in cm?
<crimlo>	every city's population needs to be reduced
<ceil>	crimlo: kill 'em all, i say
<hhmmm>	cos multiplying
<crimlo>	not all, just 99.67%
<tortib>	sheep, if my business continues to grow, i'll be alright.
<ceil>	hhmmm: ah, right
<DoverMo>	crimlo, other countries have higher employment rates
<crimlo>	i'm sure
<ceil>	40cm is probably easier to multiply than 1 3/8 inches or whatever it comes to
<hmir>	See me!
<hmir>	Be me!
<DoverMo>	in the u.s., state funded hiring centers are becoming more of a neccessity
<hmir>	Free me!
<DoverMo>	hmir, i am you O:
<crimlo>	DoverMo seem its that way for everything in the u.s.
<hmir>	ceil; 400mm is easy to multiply too...
<ceil>	indeed
*	hmir slaps DoverMo upside down with a small whale
<DoverMo>	hmir, D:
<hhmmm>	a small whale being ten tuna ?
<DoverMo>	could always... pick lettuce
<hhmmm>	or 1000000000 sardines
<hmir>	No, a baby whale.
<hmir>	It's about 12 meters long.

<tortib>	It's called their phone and google maps
<n0lan>	^lol tortib
<SimenOlai>	Yes but A NAVIGATION DEVICE
<SimenOlai>	not a app
<SimenOlai>	haha
<tortib>	maybe the will dunno
<treefiddy_>	SimenOlai: the have cars
<treefiddy_>	they
<treefiddy_>	and apps for your device
<SimenOlai>	"Oh I dont need a navigation device, I can just buy their car instead"
<treefiddy_>	i guess they dont' forsee a market for a stand alone device
<VEndix>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WJFjXtHcy4
<treefiddy_>	you can get a garmin? idk are any of those companies still in business
<SimenOlai>	Well it would be good compitition, because their mapupdates would be free, right?
<treefiddy_>	yeah idk
<SimenOlai>	Also, I would never sit in a driverless car without being focused on the road and be able to overcontroll it
<SimenOlai>	Pretty sure theres a lot of stuff they cant observe, both ways
<treefiddy_>	it'd be like sitting in a bus or a train
<SimenOlai>	A bus isnt driverless
*	n0lan hates public transport
<SimenOlai>	both a bus and a train has a driver
<n0lan>	i would rather walk barefoot through the dezert than take a fucking bus again

<SimenOlai>	How do they work with emergency services?
<treefiddy_>	EMS broadcasts a signal with a range
<tortib>	SimenOlai, you could put sensors in the car so it picks up the emergency vehicles lights
<tortib>	in the front back and sides
<treefiddy_>	the main computers shuffle the cars to the side
<SimenOlai>	and what if theres no space?
<tortib>	i wouldn't make it a signal
<tortib>	that could be exploited
<treefiddy_>	they would be programmed to move well in advance
<treefiddy_>	technically they wouldnt slow down, just move to the side
<treefiddy_>	open up 1 single lane of traffic
<SimenOlai>	You know, there arent multiple lanes everywhere
<tortib>	you would need sensors to pickup the area
<treefiddy_>	yeah start in metro areas
<treefiddy_>	or suburbs maybe
<tortib>	I think there is a car that drives itself already
<treefiddy_>	they have prototypes
<tortib>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPTIXldrq3Q

<princefakhan>	does somethin like this even happen?

<princefakhan>	there is also a wierd problem. everytime I recieve a call on the tele, the modem restarts. :(
<d1etyd3vil>	Receive a call on the tele?
<azizLIGHT>	are you on dialup
<d1etyd3vil>	I thought he meant television xD. I'm still sleepy
<d1etyd3vil>	He's on AOL.
<azizLIGHT>	princefakhan: if you got dsl, i think you need that splitter thing
<azizLIGHT>	forgot what its called
<princefakhan>	I'm on dsl. yes.
<azizLIGHT>	noise filter i think
<azizLIGHT>	you have that?
<princefakhan>	I dont think so.
<princefakhan>	I have the modem. the telephone. and a small box which connects the cable to the telephone.
<princefakhan>	I also don't know what that box is called.
<azizLIGHT>	A DSL filter or microfilter is an analog low-pass filter installed between analog devices (such as telephones or analog modems) and a plain old telephone service (POTS) line, in order to prevent interference between such devices and a digital subscriber line (DSL) service operating on the same line. Without DSL filters, signals or echoes from analog devices at the top of their frequency range can result in
<azizLIGHT>	reduced performance and connection problems with DSL service, while those from the DSL service at the bottom of its range can result in line noise and other issues for analog devices.
<azizLIGHT>	oh so you might have it
<d1etyd3vil>	Just call them and tell them to come over and fix it. That's what I'd do lol.
<princefakhan>	I may have said that a long time ago.
<princefakhan>	they just don't care.
<hhmmm>	so tweet about how useless they are
<hhmmm>	i'm sure the marketing dept will pick up on that quick
<princefakhan>	I even asked them to change the cable as there are a lot of cuts, but there seems to be no response. lol.
<princefakhan>	yeah. that's the problem. it is a government organization.
<princefakhan>	thee public sector here is shit as hell.
<d1etyd3vil>	Where you from?

<n0lan>	so I was reading up on FBI crime stuff, and i forget the source, but an official said they believe the murder rate in the USA has gone down since the 2000 census due to "More people spending time online" - what are your thoughts on this?
<hmir>	People too busy fapping to kill each other. =\

<CosmicWitch>	n0lan, you should get clean

<princefakhan>	I can't irc.
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<n0lan>	lol
<klixa>	damn, kate had a  8lbs 3oz  baby...and shes  tiiiiiiny
<n0lan>	I'm not an alcoholic, I'm a wine coinoissuer
<n0lan>	*connoisseur
<klixa>	babies are getting huge
<n0lan>	i avoid hard liquor
<princefakhan>	there should be a chat log or something. I missed it all. :(
<n0lan>	I mean I got drunk at the Bellagio back in March
<klixa>	30 years ago, they were all about 6 pounds...now they are all 8-ish pounds
<n0lan>	but
<n0lan>	IDK
<Time-Warp>	princefakhan: oh no fear i have everything loged and posting it all to the Department Of Homeland Security let me get you the lots

<Time-Warp>	JK
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<n0lan>	My family agrees that I'm not an alcoholic
<n0lan>	It doesn't run in my family
<n0lan>	HOWEVER, the organisation has helped me
<n0lan>	i met some really cool people and it taught me several coping skills
<Time-Warp>	think i scared off princefakhan :(
<n0lan>	I mean AA is really a cult, Some things they preach about are really ludicrous - such as "perhaps science will someday make a normal drinker out of an alcoholic" - UMMM it's called ANTIDEPRESSANTS (or psych meds in general)
<prison_>	:\
<n0lan>	I guess AA is a great resource for people who aren't blessed or lucky enough to have health insurance.
<prison_>	there is no cure for any addiciton other than abstainign from that substance
<Butt3rfly>	klixa, she had the baby just 2 hours after arriving at the hospital
*	hacker is now known as noob
<n0lan>	abstaining doesn't work
<prison_>	yes it does
<n0lan>	it's about moderation
<prison_>	:\
<n0lan>	well to a degree
<prison_>	you're retarded and im not humoring this conversation any longer
<prison_>	good day
<n0lan>	im sorry prison_
<n0lan>	:(
<n0lan>	i agree that abstaining from certain behaviours is the thing to do
<n0lan>	like stealing, shoplifting, for example.
<n0lan>	invading homes. we all wanna do it, but we choose not to because it's not the right thing to do
<n0lan>	:)
<prison_>	you're an awful troll
<n0lan>	i dont mean to be a troll.
*	prison_ hums another one bites the dust
<Time-Warp>	n0lan: i went to AA because i had an addiction of cracking into computer networks. i couldnt stop. its like all i could think about. security guards couldnt stop me they had no idea what was going on
<Time-Warp>	as i was already inside there network
<n0lan>	Time-Warp: really?
<Time-Warp>	like an invisible ghost
<n0lan>	:P
<Time-Warp>	n0lan: no jk
<Time-Warp>	LOL

<n0lan>	Time-Warp: do you think im trolling? that really isn't my intention
<n0lan>	I mean I'd never shoot up heroin or anything into my vein
<Time-Warp>	n0lan: neather have i
<n0lan>	Abstaining from IV drug use is obviously good
<hmir>	Smoochie time!!!!!!
<CosmicWitch>	n0lan, sometimes its not so much about intentions
<prison_>	no
<CosmicWitch>	but the results that come about
<hmir>	Everyone pucker up!!!!
<n0lan>	prison_: i am sorry if i upset you
<n0lan>	:)
<n0lan>	yessss

<n0lan>	i gotta switch to Winblows ugh bbl gang

<n0lan>	peace~
<CosmicWitch>	if*
<princefakhan>	AnTi_MTtr for that his dad has to marry a princess or a queen

<diogenese>	A few tsunamis and earthquakes. Nothing to worry about.
<princefakhan>	I'm stuck on big island since then. xD
<Time-Warp>	think if you were on this tiny island and there was a sunami
<Time-Warp>	and it flooded the entire thing like million foot wave
<Time-Warp>	and your on like an island thats only like 5 miles long
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<Time-Warp>	be all looking up saying WTF
<tallguy>	1989 huge san francisco earthquake, wrecked lotsa stuff including Oakland Bay Bridge
<princefakhan>	oh! I think I'm recieving previous msges.
<Time-Warp>	tallguy: oh snap
<princefakhan>	do u guys know abot an annoying thing.
<princefakhan>	a big event happens around you and you don't know shit about it.
<Time-Warp>	lol
<tallguy>	if ya are online you hear about big events right away
<princefakhan>	I don't know how tallguy's sis would have been feeling during that golden gate quake.
<Time-Warp>	would have been like WTF
<tallguy>	well the Bridge took the rock 'n roll just fine, it was the land at the SF end that got all fooked up
<princefakhan>	oh well when the recent quakes hit I was on-road when I came home my family was quaking about it. and the whole internet too. xD
<princefakhan>	and I assure you Time-Warp i was like: WTF
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<princefakhan>	:P
<princefakhan>	San Andreas is the most earthquake prone region, isn'tt it?
<Time-Warp>	yea
<Time-Warp>	because of the tectonic plates
<princefakhan>	and what are faults then?
<Time-Warp>	when the plates go under each other
<princefakhan>	I read about these in 8th grade and nothing since then about internal geography. lol
<princefakhan>	that causes earthquakes. I know that. yes
<tallguy>	we have been hopeing thatthe san andreas fault will drop most of california off into the ocean for a loonng time
<princefakhan>	hmmm.
<princefakhan>	so what is a fault exactly
<Time-Warp>	LOL TALLGUY
<tallguy>	a huge crack along edges in the tectonic plates
<princefakhan>	hmmm. okay.
<tallguy>	the tectonic plates shift deep underground, can let lava out or earthquakes occur
<princefakhan>	then I think whole buildings goes down when these faulty plates strike each other hard.
<Time-Warp>	lol
<Time-Warp>	be like wtf how did i get so low
<princefakhan>	those big wide cracks on the roads are these faults. arent they.
<princefakhan>	hehe. Time-warp
<Time-Warp>	LOL
*	princefakhan giggling
<Time-Warp>	princefakhan: thats from water expanding and contracting in weather conditions
<princefakhan>	just tell me. those assumptions are right. arent they.

<SimenOlai>	princefakhan, Well I have no idea how the surroundings were
<BillyPi>	yet she just sits there and watches netflix
<princefakhan>	hey I'm fat and so I'm mad at you BillyPi
<BillyPi>	it aggrivates me
<SimenOlai>	Even if he might slipped off the road, he might have hit something that made him fly over the train and to the other side
<BillyPi>	some people sweat blood every day of their lives
<SimenOlai>	landing on a massmurderer who was about to rape someone
<BillyPi>	and some people demand to be loved for being shitty and unkept
<SimenOlai>	MORAL OF THE STORY, DRIVE FAST
<princefakhan>	welcome to 20th century. u can no longer be fat due to the tv. that positopn is held by netflix now.
<SimenOlai>	You might save someone
<BillyPi>	yeah it's held by netflix
<BillyPi>	how aren't people ashamed of just sitting there watching dumb shows all day
<SimenOlai>	princefakhan,
<SimenOlai>	Pretty sure its 21th century
<princefakhan>	Simenolai: dude. that is great thinking
<princefakhan>	oh yess
<princefakhan>	its 21st.
<SimenOlai>	netflix didnt exist in 20th century
<SimenOlai>	okay not suer
<SimenOlai>	let me google that
<BillyPi>	what can i do?
<BillyPi>	-_-
<princefakhan>	I'm still in the century when people become fat due to the TV
<SimenOlai>	okay netflix did in fact exist in 20th century
<SimenOlai>	It was made in 1997
<BillyPi>	LOL netflix in 1997
<binaryhermit>	not as a streaming service, I'm pretty sure
<geektech713>	netflix did DVD by mail first
<SimenOlai>	yeah
<SimenOlai>	I know
<SimenOlai>	binaryhermit, 2007 they started that
<princefakhan>	BillyPi i don't know man. I don't have a gf.
<SimenOlai>	they waited 10 years to get it
<SimenOlai>	now its almost 10 years ago
<SimenOlai>	daym
<princefakhan>	I don't know if that is lucky rhough.
<BillyPi>	princefakhan, why not?
<SimenOlai>	10 years ago since 2005
<BillyPi>	not lucky/not lucky
<binaryhermit>	then again, most people were on dialup in 1997
<princefakhan>	Billypi: ohh no! shit. xD
<binaryhermit>	and video codec quality's probably come a long way in the past 17-18 years
<BillyPi>	it's funny but women come when you succeed a bit
<BillyPi>	the more u succeed the more women come
<binaryhermit>	not to mention audio codec quality
<binaryhermit>	1997 video and audio quality over dialup would suck
<BillyPi>	think about how many shitty women there are, sitting there watching netflix on friday
<BillyPi>	complaining that they are "forever alone"
<princefakhan>	explains why I didn't have a girl.
<princefakhan>	its all about monies. lol!
<princefakhan>	u get honey if u have money.
<slinnky>	w0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000t
<slinnky>	poo tang
<honey>	no. i have my own money.
<BillyPi>	princefakhan, it's simple. u need to show that u have money to be able to sustain a family
<princefakhan>	not u honey.
<BillyPi>	women want security
<honey>	well you hightlighted me. lol
<BillyPi>	if u live at home with no job it's no wonder no one wants that lol
<honey>	so i answered.
<BillyPi>	does your waifu want to be your mom too? lol
<princefakhan>	lol. atleast we have one more in the talk.  xD
<princefakhan>	well if the guy is at home, I think she is most secure.
<BillyPi>	money is basic necessity. if u have that u open yourself to the possibility of finding a truly good girl
<BillyPi>	and u show sufficient competence to be able to hold a job, finance, etc
<princefakhan>	unless u talking about the other secuirity.
<BillyPi>	some girls blow that out of proportion and expect gold buttplugs
<BillyPi>	women want physical and emotional security
<rosenberg>	hi
<princefakhan>	Money is God. that's what I think.
<princefakhan>	hello rosenberg
<BillyPi>	money is just the bare minimum yo
<rosenberg>	heya
<BillyPi>	$70K/year opens you up to any girl you want
<BillyPi>	statistically, at least in canadia
<princefakhan>	hmmm. great.

<princefakhan>	haha. lol.
<princefakhan>	that's why I like cross compatible stuff.
<trust1>	ah much better
<princefakhan>	and most of those are open source.
<klixa>	the bootcamp assistant, for example, is artifically inhibited
<klixa>	it *could* do the job just refuses
<honey>	lol at mac
<Time-Warp>	dude someone was smoking crack in the library bathroom

<Symantic>	windows boot?
<princefakhan>	unetbootin not working
<Time-Warp>	does macs have the dd if= of=/dev/sdb blah
<Symantic>	install virtual machine. oracle or whatever, install windows via iso, then use windows 7 usb tool to create the bootable windows drive
<princefakhan>	klixa well what I said is supposedly less confusing i think
<Time-Warp>	because you could create a bootable disk with dd command
<Symantic>	easiest way i found from linux.
<princefakhan>	there is a lot of apps for windows to make bootable usb. yes.
<klixa>	Time-Warp: yeah you can do dd on a mac
<Symantic>	vm, fin.
<Symantic>	easiest way
<Time-Warp>	klixa: dd if=bootableimage.iso of=/dev/sdb
<princefakhan>	win7 usb tool, poweriso, zotac winusb maker

<tonyt>	I went to the supermarket today , and I was there for literally 5 minutes. When I came out there was a cop writing a parking ticket. So I went up to him and said, "Come on, buddy, how about giving a guy a break?" He ignored me and continued writing the ticket. So I called him a pencil-necked Dick headed cop. He glared at me and started writing another ticket for worn tires! So I then asked him
<tonyt>	if his psychiatrist makes him lie face down on the couch cause he's so ugly. He finished the second ticket and put it on the windshield with the first. Then he started writing a third ticket! This went on until he had placed 5 tickets on the winshield... the more I insulted him, the more tickets he wrote. I didn't care. My car was parked around the corner.
<Time-Warp>	klixa: have you ever been to nun?

<princefakhan>	The term derives from an episode of, 'The Young Apprentice.' (A British TV show.)The task was to create a popcorn brand. One of the candidates, Harry M persistently (throughout the episode) attempted to make the team choose his idea, a popcorn called 'Smoochies'. This was in spite of the fact that the rest of his team disliked the idea and had in fact chosen a different theme and flavour.

<Butt3rfly>	kent is nice
<dc2>	didnt realise i was in kent till i saw a map for the castle the wedding was
<princefakhan>	oh! thanks honey. xD
*	artwoodwork is now known as GaryPooper
<GaryPooper>	nyuck nyuck
<princefakhan>	penguin1263: I don't get what u r implying there
<penguin1263>	random language
<princefakhan>	oh. its arabic.
<hmir>	i don't see no arabic
<princefakhan>	do u know arabic
<hmir>	yes a little bit
<hmir>	allahuakbar!!!
<princefakhan>	oh fvck.
<princefakhan>	u people don't even know what that means and flood the internet with it.
<idioterna>	hmir: what does that mean?
<idioterna>	i know salam alejkum
<hmir>	I'm having a crisis of faith!
<hmir>	It means "god is great".
<princefakhan>	Allah-u-Akbar mean Allah is Great.
<princefakhan>	Salamalaikum is peace be on you.
<idioterna>	everyone greeted me like that
<idioterna>	they didn't appreciate i was an atheist, but nobody killed me for it
<hmir>	God is an abstract concept.
<hmir>	It means whatever you want it to mean.
<idioterna>	but allah is a specific god
<idioterna>	like jesus or jahve
<hmir>	In their 'interpretation' of it.
<princefakhan>	idioterna: correct
<hmir>	We all interpret things differently.
<idioterna>	of course, but the "allah-u-akbar" is like saying "jesus is your saviour"
<idioterna>	it acknowledges a specific interpretation
<idioterna>	and does not discuss the general concept of a deity
<hmir>	It means literally god is great. God and allah are the same thing.
<hmir>	100% the same.
<hmir>	The christian god and the muslim god are the same thing.
<hmir>	islam is built around the premise that the bible is the word of god, but the message has been distorted over time, become impure. So god/allah sent another prophet with the message again...
<grant>	hmir sounds like tcp
<princefakhan>	so are 2 other books
<hmir>	My interpretation of god is my own.
*	grant cocks shotgun
<grant>	THER IS ONLY ONE GOD AND ITS MY INTERPRETATION OF GOD
*	grant *gunfire in the background*
<sabotender>	sounds like the spanish inquisition
<sabotender>	or the crusades
<princefakhan>	God and god is different, fyi.
<BillyPi>	lol i'm fishing all the girls here
<Thete>	omg you'll blow people's minds staaahp
<princefakhan>	God is One. god is not.
<sabotender>	also, moo 🐮
<Thete>	You can't tell them it's the same one
<RoyalBaby>	isla
<sabotender>	O_o
*	hmir hugs sabotender
<BillyPi>	stop hugging men dude lol
<RoyalBaby>	islam, the religion which allows sexual slavery, creepy
*	sabotender hugs hmir 
<hmir>	Nothing wrong with hugging men, dude.
<princefakhan>	hmir: totally.
<hmir>	You sound like you're not particularly comfortable with your sexuality.....
<sabotender>	mmm, is that an imposter Metaler
<princefakhan>	RoyalBaby: where did u read that?
<RoyalBaby>	in the Quran
<princefakhan>	u sure?
<RoyalBaby>	yes
<RoyalBaby>	'what the right hand posseses'
<sabotender>	also, there can be more than one God, its your interpretation of the word that makes it singular. Just because its your interpretation, doesn't mean its right
<RoyalBaby>	and Muhammad did this kind of things
<BillyPi>	muhammad makes good women
<sabotender>	hmm im making teriyaki chicken tonight
<sabotender>	om nom nom
<grant>	yummu
<BillyPi>	lol
<sabotender>	actually, making it now. I finally have all the ingredients to make the sauce. The fresh ginger, soy sauce, honey, etc
<princefakhan>	Royalbaby: huh! that's true.
<princefakhan>	sadly no country allows slaves.
<sabotender>	I have to be careful with the soy sauce because im actually pretty allergic to the stuff, but a dabble should be okay
<princefakhan>	does any?
<pingfloyd>	I'm surprise how few of women play chess considering how feminist of a game it is.
<RoyalBaby>	it's creepy
<hmir_>	I'm back for more smoochies1
<sabotender>	I think the way how women are suppressed in some countries may just as well be called slavery. They dont have the same freedoms, do they?
<princefakhan>	I don't know. slavery has been common for how long.
<princefakhan>	19th century I think
<RoyalBaby>	princefakhan: models are going to Dubai to sheikh's palaces, and isis organises slaves' trade
<pingfloyd>	Think about it.  The king is a helpless kept man, the queen is the only female piece that is also the most valued and most badass piece by far.
<caselogic>	nice pingfloyd
<sabotender>	just because its not called 'slavery', it has all the markers for being slavery. What is that saying? If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck....
<princefakhan>	sabotender: u need to read slavery in islam then.
<caselogic>	never thought of it that way
<pingfloyd>	and pawns, if they apply themselves, can someday hope to become a queen
<sabotender>	princefakhan: its a duck
<pingfloyd>	if your opponent gets a second queen, it is practically game over
<princefakhan>	I recenly started chess. boy I had three queens at once. :P
<pingfloyd>	so next you ask a woman if she'd like to play some chess and she says that's a guy's game.  You know what to tell her.
<idioterna>	RoyalBaby: how is islam creepy if it allows sexual slavery?
<pingfloyd>	*next time
<idioterna>	RoyalBaby: the bible very literally allows exactly the same thing
<sunstar>	apple watch is racist against ppl w/ tattoos  :P
<RoyalBaby>	idioterna: this is the reason that I don't follow the bible
<princefakhan>	slavery has been allowed in abrahamic religion.
<sabotender>	sunstar: rubbish. the technology doesn't work very well with people who have tattoos
<princefakhan>	but I don't guess what isis does is slavery.
<sabotender>	its an unintended consequence
<idioterna>	RoyalBaby: me neither, but many people still claim western civilization was founded on christianity
<sunstar>	so it doesnt like ppl with tattoos
<idioterna>	christianity being the political system analogous to islam
<princefakhan>	idioterna: according to history. yes.
<princefakhan>	:D
<idioterna>	but it's not true, of course
<princefakhan>	but it has been before Islam
<princefakhan>	Islam started spreading very fast.
<idioterna>	just like most islamic scholars, most christian scholars were religious merely because none of the other bright people got the means to pursue intellectual careers
<sabotender>	idioterna: it really wasn't. It was founded on the genocide of native americans, and individuals who wanted to be free to worship who and how they wanted, and Christianity (from being the type of religion it is) just happened to become popular.
<princefakhan>	and so those popes started turning pagan people to islam
<idioterna>	sabotender: yes, something like that
<princefakhan>	by not good means.
<RoyalBaby>	Mithra was before Jesus and he was also born from virgin and on 25th December
<idioterna>	how can you tell?
<sabotender>	princefakhan: the christians did exactly the same thing during the crusades. A LOT of people were murdered because they refused to convert
<idioterna>	the calendars they kept back in the day weren't all that accurate
<princefakhan>	that's what I'm saying actually sabotender
<sabotender>	and what happens when you wipe out an opposing religion? most of what are left are the Christians. That's the main reason why it is so popular today
<princefakhan>	how can you tell 25th december was the day he was born. or jesus.
<princefakhan>	princefakhan> and so those popes started turning pagan people to islam. correction. to christianity.
<idioterna>	yeah we figured as much :)
<princefakhan>	lol. why would they turn them to islam. to lose control over there territories. :P
<RoyalBaby>	according to some sources which I have read today Jesus had brothers and sisters
<idioterna>	yeah, probably
<princefakhan>	dunno about that
<sabotender>	If he were a real person, I wouldn't be surprised.
<idioterna>	it's fairly obvious his mom was no virgin when she gave birth
<hhmmm>	:o
<idioterna>	well the roman record shows a jew by that name did live thereabouts
<idioterna>	so jesus very likely really existed
<princefakhan>	well there have been incidences of a female giving birth without sexual intercourse.
<princefakhan>	not human ofc
<idioterna>	yeah, sure
<hmir_>	this talk is too intellecutalized
<hmir_>	=/
<gizmonizmo|away>	=\
<idioterna>	uh
<idioterna>	sorry
<sabotender>	idioterna: Right, and it was probably a normal person who stood up to the man, and then through tellings and retellings, the stories of his acts were...embellished. Kind of like the story of Paul Bunyan
<hmir_>	You better be!
<sabotender>	hmir_: your ending underscore is confusing :-P
<idioterna>	do i have to threaten people with eternal suffering or something?
<idioterna>	or how do i de-intellectualize it?
<princefakhan>	hmir_: this is history. which we are not very sure is true.
<princefakhan>	so is it intellectual. idk.
<hmir_>	History is written by the victors...
<idioterna>	in this case, the big bang won.
<sabotender>	hmir_: you are quite correct.
<princefakhan>	or absolutely correct.
<idioterna>	the universe is still observable and still contains microware background radiation
<princefakhan>	microwave background radiation?
<idioterna>	after some billion years that will no longer hold true
<idioterna>	princefakhan: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background
<princefakhan>	ofc, why did i even ask a scienctific term. you gotta google it. xD
<idioterna>	princefakhan: if you listen to radio spectrum anywhere in the currently observable universe, you can pick up the constant noise that remains echoing across the space
<princefakhan>	oh! I think I have heard about it.
<idioterna>	this is actual thermal radiation, the kind you'd today get when exploding a nuclear bomb for example
<idioterna>	but about 13.5 billion years later
<princefakhan>	so if you create a device that could catch those waves. you may have evidence to certain history.
<princefakhan>	right?
<idioterna>	yeah
<idioterna>	and the device is fairly primitive
<princefakhan>	hmmm. oh!
<idioterna>	if you have an old TV you can see this radiation when you tune into something that isn't anything
<princefakhan>	so the only we need to do s wait those billion years
<idioterna>	the "snow" you can watch on an "empty" frequency
<idioterna>	is actually this noise
<princefakhan>	huh! never had a tv. so cant tell.
<princefakhan>	tho. interesting.
<cleerline>	never had a TV? not even as a kid?
<idioterna>	well i'm fairly old
<idioterna>	it's been more than 20 years since i've seen a tv like that
<idioterna>	my grandma had one
<idioterna>	an old grundig
<princefakhan>	well I lived in a village for about 10 yrs. and the village did not have access to enough tech.
<idioterna>	the country switched to DVB so now none of the old TVs work
<cleerline>	princefakhan: You in india?
<princefakhan>	only some had tvs.
<princefakhan>	yeah cleerline
<cleerline>	idioterna: which country you in?
<idioterna>	cleerline: slovenia
<cleerline>	prawnsalad: Oh ok
<princefakhan>	then I moved to New Delhi and was fascinated by computers.
<cleerline>	slovenia. Hmmm. So the whole world is going digital I guess
<princefakhan>	xD
<idioterna>	i traveled central asia and few people had tvs in early 2000s
<idioterna>	but most had radios
<cleerline>	princefakhan: oh yes? You in IT these days?
<Estr>	Good to be home
<Estr>	Now I wanna go out and party though
<Estr>	But I also have to wake up early tomorrow and run some errands
<idioterna>	if that's your thing... why not?
<princefakhan>	cleerline: Yeah. :D
<idioterna>	Estr: if you don't go to sleep you won't have to wake up early
<cleerline>	idioterna: really? Arer you talking in the villages or the cities?
<Estr>	I don't wanna come stinking alcohol either you know
<princefakhan>	idioterna: so is there no chance those tvs work today and I might have a chance to see that occurence in a museum or something.
<Estr>	Some guy from uruguay, kind of family, my grandpas wifes son, is gonna go out and party, thinking of joining him
<diogenese>	I remember the snow screens. Old black and white tv's
<Estr>	he's quite awesome
<cleerline>	what about the "static" on an FM radio? Is that CMB radiation as well?
<cleerline>	I guess thats not as dramatic as snow on a TV
<sabotender>	anyone seen mythica: a quest for heroes?
<Estr>	In 2018 FM radios wont work in norway anymore
<Estr>	Only dab
<idioterna>	cleerline: country-wide
<idioterna>	cleerline: we've had DVB-T and DVB-C exclusively for the past three years now
<idioterna>	or maybe two
<idioterna>	dunno, i don't really watch tv :)
<Estr>	No one does these days
<cleerline>	Estr: I heard that. Thats kinda bad. Cos most cell phones have an FM radio built in and it uses much less battery than internet radio or DAB.
<idioterna>	AM radio will keep working though
<Estr>	Who the hell uses their phones as a radio?
<princefakhan>	idioterna: and thats why I don't know about that stuff. everything is available on the internet.
<grant>	Estr idiots
<princefakhan>	why buy another equipment
<cleerline>	idioterna: what are they? One is TV what is the other? cable?
<idioterna>	cleerline: yeah
<cleerline>	Estr: I use my phone as a radio everyday!
<Estr>	dahell
<Estr>	who even listens to radio at all?!
<Estr>	except in the car
<cleerline>	Estr: I mean to listen to the radio whilst i am out.
<princefakhan>	if mine had a working radio app I would too.
<Estr>	but hell we got aux cords in the car
<diogenese>	I don't have a tv, radio or a car.
<princefakhan>	I have to mke do with internet radio
<idioterna>	Estr: radio is really important
<sabotender>	hd digital radio
<Walrushead>	tv is weird
<cleerline>	Estr: lol. I listen to it most of the day1!!!! I love the radio. Dont you like to listen to the radio whilst you chat and surf?
<Estr>	No, they only play the same songs over and over and over and ooooooover again
<idioterna>	it's the only communication tech that actually works in all disaster scenarios
<idioterna>	i keep a radio on in the kitchen
<Estr>	I listen to spotify
<Estr>	no radio
<idioterna>	so i'll know when the nuclear holocaust starts
<Estr>	like hell, i listen to spotify 8-12 hours a day
<Estr>	even in the shower
<Estr>	i cover my phone in a plastic bag
<idioterna>	they'll go "attention, citizens of the earth - this is the final broadcast"
<Estr>	and listen to music
<idioterna>	interesting
<Estr>	well, i cant do that anymore because you know.. it doesnt work anymore
<princefakhan>	do you recieve emergency broadcasts estr
<Estr>	princefakhan, meh, long hair dont care
<Estr>	i just got a haircut so nvm
<princefakhan>	on spotify i men
<Estr>	but ye
<Estr>	no
<princefakhan>	hah! well the radio does.
<Estr>	hmm i wonder if spotify got something like that buildt in
<Estr>	they should have
<princefakhan>	they should do that yes.
<princefakhan>	all the music/video providers or whatever they are called should do that.
<princefakhan>	is it hard to turn radio signal to digital. can yu?
<hhmmm>	you can listen to fm radio on androids
<princefakhan>	Estr: though I would like spotify/pandora too but the internet connection is a problem here.
<princefakhan>	so I cant have my torrents and online music at the same time.
<Estr>	princefakhan, just download spotify lists offline
<princefakhan>	my phone does not have spotify app.
<Estr>	I got like 30k +/- songs downloaded
<princefakhan>	and we need premium for that dont we?
<Estr>	yes
<Estr>	its really cheap though
<sabotender>	nothing beats pandora radio
<Estr>	Like I'd pay 4x the price and still be happy
<princefakhan>	it is. but I don't earn money. lol.
<Eclipse>	I binge coded today
<princefakhan>	well if u want on demand sabotender then spotify is the thing.
<Estr>	i dont earn money either
<Estr>	i got my mum
<princefakhan>	but if you talk radio online or fm then pandora yes.
<princefakhan>	you wont be listening to the same thing again an again all day long
<princefakhan>	Estr: my mums don't even know internet.
<Estr>	princefakhan, neither does mine
<princefakhan>	ahh! well she does. she uses all them IM video calling stuff.
<Estr>	she just pays
<Estr>	and i use
<princefakhan>	she can browse through news on cnn and stuff.
<princefakhan>	:P
<princefakhan>	Estr: I want a mum like urs.
<idioterna>	anyway, analog radio is the fallback you need to keep running
<Estr>	hell no you dont
<idioterna>	it's easy to send and receive
<princefakhan>	well only the good stuff Estr
<princefakhan>	like payingg my bills
<Estr>	theres no good perks about my mum
<Estr>	well, she sometimes, maybe once a week, drive me somewhere
<Estr>	thats maybe a perk i guess
<hhmmm>	crikey
<princefakhan>	she pays your bills don't she.
<hhmmm>	banned from the kitchen?
<Estr>	I'm 16
<Estr>	i dont pay no bills
<hhmmm>	do you do some housework every day?
<Estr>	Yes
<princefakhan>	ahh! internet expenses are bill for me.
<Estr>	I do like more housework a day than my mum does a year
<princefakhan>	and I'm 17.
<Estr>	literally
<princefakhan>	hehe. Estr
<hhmmm>	oh, good job
<Estr>	Not like I do a lot of housework everyday
<Estr>	but she does nothing
<princefakhan>	well I would like to keep getting money every month. so I can do my thangs.

<SimenOlai>	princefakhan, how can I make 1 program not make sound, via windows
<cleerline>	princefakhan: do you have the internet in your home? If so, how much do you pay for it?
<princefakhan>	if u r talking about my internet, I pay Rs. 1200 a month. for 1mbit/s
<Time-Warp>	1200 a month lol
<cleerline>	princefakhan: how much is that in dollars?
<Time-Warp>	you could get a fiber connection for that much
<princefakhan>	Simenolai: do you see the icon of that program from the audio control accessible from the task bar.
<SimenOlai>	1200 what?
<cleerline>	Time-Warp: he is talking about Rupees
<Time-Warp>	oh
<SimenOlai>	Yes princefakhan
<pingfloyd>	1200 cents?
<Time-Warp>	lol
<SimenOlai>	I have deactivated all devices except the one going to my headset
<SimenOlai>	It wont let me "mix"
<princefakhan>	Simenolai: um! I thought you wanted to mute that program.
<SimenOlai>	yes
<SimenOlai>	I want to mute a program
<princefakhan>	guys: that's rs. 1200. i dont wanna open google. do the calc urself.
<SimenOlai>	But the audio control thingy on the task bar isnt available
<SimenOlai>	"because no sound devices could be found"
<pingfloyd>	sounds like a currency in need of a new denomination
<princefakhan>	oh! the only solution to that problem I know of is restarting ur pc.
<princefakhan>	pingfloyd: sure.
<SimenOlai>	Doesnt work
<Time-Warp>	i have a week before i can buy coffee with food stamps
<geektech713>	just restart your PC

<princefakhan>	I pay $17.6 a month for my internet connection. I can have better. other providers came in thi locality reecently.
<Eclipse>	^
<Eclipse>	I've invested about £50 in dogecoin
<pingfloyd>	I knew it was a bubble, there's no way it couldn't be

<princefakhan>	is it Mbit or Mbyt
<bazhang>	yes
<sunstar>	around here comcast finds a way to make it over a hundred dollars no matter what package you go with
<geektech713>	well i bought a Cable modem .somehow Comcast found a reason to fry it
<geektech713>	lost 50 bucks
<princefakhan>	huh! I can have 10 mbit/s for less thn 30 usd.
<princefakhan>	how is that.
<sunstar>	introductory offer
<geektech713>	Promotional offer
<sunstar>	then theres all the fees and taxes and surcharges
<geektech713>	after 12 or 6 months the prices rises
<pingfloyd>	China is where the good noodles are
<princefakhan>	no its not promotional. from other isp. they were not available in this locality.
<sunstar>	no Japan has the best noodles
<princefakhan>	they are tring to.

<pingfloyd>	comcast is such a racket
<princefakhan>	that's is less than $30 after those surcharges
<Time-Warp>	chatorites?
<pingfloyd>	comcast pretty much sucks in every way imaginable
<Walrushead>	pingfloyd: wait until you see a game of tennis!

<Estr>	The confermation today was pretty interesting though
<Walrushead>	there's rackets everywhere
<Walrushead>	in tennis
<Estr>	Because apparently I got a lot of family that I didn't know
<Time-Warp>	pingfloyd: thank you for calling comcast this is Time-Warp how can i help you?

<Estr>	And yeah, she gave me a bj on a party a looong time ago
<Estr>	not even sure if she recognized me
<Estr>	princefakhan, no, confermation
<Estr>	when you get 15 you invite family and friends and get tons of money and stuff

<pingfloyd>	he might have to sandpaper his penis after he finds out
<princefakhan>	TimeWarp: what? thank god we have that thing free here
<Estr>	LOL
<Time-Warp>	pingfloyd: i understand this is unconvent for you would you like me to give you a 20 dollar credit

*	Estr sighs

<princefakhan>	no goddamnit. no
<pingfloyd>	there was this one place called the hungry hobo.  I liked their subs.
<princefakhan>	Well comcast does magic
<klixa>	princefakhan: i dont have room for 2, my brother is already coming to visit
<tortib>	Walrushead, people own people all the damn time, what do you think employment is?
*	GaryPooper is now known as artwoodwork
<Time-Warp>	princefakhan: is it ok if i initilize your new x1 box
<klixa>	tortib: emplyment is not ownership cause employee can quit
<Time-Warp>	:D
<pingfloyd>	employment is voluntary
<tortib>	klixa, yeah and then what happens?  They have no money
<Walrushead>	tortib: what klixa said
<princefakhan>	what an xl box
<tortib>	How the hell is it voluntary?
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<klixa>	tortib: yeah, well, i have had no $$ and was just fine :)
<Walrushead>	tortib: they get a wii and PRINT MONII
<pingfloyd>	you work at your own will
<tortib>	You HAVE to work to get money without money you're pretty much screwed
<tortib>	klixa, yeah because you're a woman
<klixa>	tortib: i lived in a car in malibu for like 3 years... living off odd jobs my bf and i did intermittenly
<Time-Warp>	princefakhan: its a tv box comcast offers its like super high quality tv
<pingfloyd>	tortib: don't think you understand what that word means
<Time-Warp>	its magic box
<princefakhan>	oh! no comcast. only tv I like is hbo
<Time-Warp>	:D
<tortib>	pingfloyd, which word?
<princefakhan>	and we have hbo now.
<klixa>	tortib: my father never had emplyment and he was a man... he did however own his own successful business and spent his 84 years doing what he loved
<Time-Warp>	HBO!!!!!!!!
<princefakhan>	so here is the finger. :p
<Time-Warp>	YAY
<Time-Warp>	LMAO
<tortib>	klixa, yeah that's what I'm attempting to do
<honey>	oh we're going to  have another chat baby soon. lol
<pingfloyd>	tortib: voluntary
<tortib>	pingfloyd, I know exactly what it means.
<pingfloyd>	1. done, given, or acting of one's own free will.
<pingfloyd>	you think it means working for free
<Time-Warp>	is that the real metaler
<Time-Warp>	dont think it is
<pingfloyd>	it can include that
<tortib>	how is it free will, you need money to survive and you have to work to get it so either you get money by working for someone else or get a loan from a bank (which is pretty difficult to do right now) and start your own business.
<klixa>	tortib: life is what you make of it... yes many people are "owned" or are in "slavery" in a way, but its all in their heads... within reason all of us can do what we want
<Walrushead>	I have a question
<Walrushead>	what is the name of that sleeping medication that makes you do weird things?
<tortib>	klixa, it isn't all in their head
<klixa>	tortib: no, you need food to survve... and water... you could buy land, live off grid and sell some taomtoes every now and then for property tax
<pingfloyd>	there's people that survive without money
<funkentelechrxp>	I am here
<funkentelechrxp>	You may all rejoice
<pingfloyd>	nobody said it would be easy
<tortib>	klixa, yeah you're just going to live on a plot of land?  No shelter?
<klixa>	tortib: you can build a shelter
<tortib>	You need money to get the land
<tortib>	you need money to get materials
<klixa>	off grid doesnt imply NO SHELTER...geesh
<tortib>	to build shelter
<Estr>	Walrushead, they're called "Do-not-use-this-because-it-will-fuck-up-everything-about-you"
<klixa>	tortib: yeah, so you sacrifice a few years to get the money..so what
<pingfloyd>	I agree, people's own minds are their biggest wardens
<Walrushead>	we
<klixa>	yoyu dont have to spend your entire life working for someone else is my point
<Estr>	Literally though, like if you're looking for drugs, everything is better than that
<tortib>	a few years isn't going to give you enough money to buy a piece of land with a home on it
<funkentelechrxp>	I knew this chick that decided to live in a tent for like a year...seven years later she's still living in a tent, but it's a much bigger tent
<tortib>	and you don't even OWN the land/home
<tortib>	you're pretty much leasing it
<tortib>	once you full outright purchase the land/home you have to pay property taxes yearly
<Time-Warp>	funkentelechrxp: nice
<Time-Warp>	funkentelechrxp: bet it was cold
<klixa>	tortib: yeah, well some places those taxes are like $50 a year
<tortib>	klixa, where?
<klixa>	so what, you pay taxes
<funkentelechrxp>	Time-Warp: maybe, but she was hot, so it balanced out i guess
<klixa>	tortib: super rural areas
<pingfloyd>	to the free mind a job isn't slavery, it's a stepping stone
<tortib>	because here it's about $1200-$1500+ depending on the home/land
<Time-Warp>	funkentelechrxp: LOL
<klixa>	tortib: they vary greatly, but i have seen rural ones as cheap as 50...most i have looked at when looking for land averaged about 400$ a year tho
<bazhang>	ambien Walrushead
<Time-Warp>	can you legely buy 2 inches of land
<princefakhan>	yeah! I caught up.
<Estr>	yo, living in a tent would be awesome though
<klixa>	Time-Warp: yes, you can get it for free actually
<klixa>	Time-Warp: look up postage stamp land
<tortib>	klixa, land with a home and if so how many acres?
<djshaji>	if you live in a tent, where'd you "go"
<Time-Warp>	klixa: oh snap
<djshaji>	you know, when nature calls
<princefakhan>	I wanna live in a van
<klixa>	tortib: didnt come with home, was just land, i was looking at $5000 and under land...and the acrage varied form .5 to 5
<Estr>	while you dream of living like dan bilzerian all i want is a motorcycle and a tent
<Time-Warp>	klixa: what if you decide to make 2 inches of land private property
<Time-Warp>	and have it patrolled by police and security
<klixa>	Time-Warp: wiht the land im telling you about, you cant
<funkentelechrxp>	i bet you could get some nice land plots in Montana for not too much $
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<Estr>	and a apartment somewhere because sometimes i need to go outside and party and taking a girl to a tent would be weird
<klixa>	Time-Warp: http://www.ownapieceofamerica.com
<klixa>	there, get your frre land
<Time-Warp>	Yay
<tortib>	lol 2" land
<pingfloyd>	Estr: only with the high maintenance ones
<tortib>	what a joke
<princefakhan>	whose with me. buy a big ass van and leave the rest of ur lif in it
<klixa>	"OK, so it's only one square inch of land, but it is land, and it is free land. " lol
<x2f>	i havea  new topic for all of you
<Estr>	pingfloyd, why?
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<Time-Warp>	SUP TORTIB
<x2f>	When an internet community hates you and bans you for an awful reason, do you feel slightly depressed and shitty and helpless?
<tortib>	you can't even build a damn drinking fountain on 2" of land
<tortib>	hey Time-Warp
<klixa>	tortib: you are like ZERO fun
<tortib>	klixa, I can't help it! :(
<tortib>	I'm so god damn serious
<Estr>	x2f, depends
*	klixa gives tortib a shot of anti-seriousness
<pingfloyd>	a debbie downer
<funkentelechrxp>	lol
<x2f>	Guess we aren't talking about my new topic.
<x2f>	Estr, just happened to me on a minecraft server
*	tortib slams the shot and asks for the bottle
<x2f>	i feel so empty and hated now...
<princefakhan>	well I don't if this is hypocrisy or what? some deem being working under a boss as slavey and want to become entrepreneurs.
<Estr>	Well, why did you get banned?
<x2f>	"i banned you because i'm sick of you"
<princefakhan>	well entrepreneurs need employees.
<funkentelechrxp>	Estr: chicks dont usually mind banging in tents. just make sure there's a ground mat and no bugs and they're cool with it
<x2f>	"always complaining about donations, class, whiny"
<pingfloyd>	x2f: nobody cares about that topic
<x2f>	"and i hate you, you are not welcome here"
<Walrushead>	tortib: please tell me you understand humor
<princefakhan>	not all of them but most do
<Estr>	funkentelechrxp, but my tent is gonna be out in the middle of nowhere
<pingfloyd>	get over it
<tortib>	princefakhan, yes and if my business becomes successful I would pay my employees well.
<x2f>	probably because ne one else has ever been banned
<tortib>	depending on how much income I have
<funkentelechrxp>	Estr: sounds good
<tortib>	Walrushead, I do.
<Estr>	taxi, drive me out of the middle of nowhere to my tent!
<Time-Warp>	we need to get opera in the room
<bazhang>	x2f, dont bring that drama here
<Walrushead>	taxi, I am on drugs
<pingfloyd>	x2f: I think most people have, they just don't lose a lot of sleep over it
<Estr>	like, i dont think a one night stand in a tent would be nice
<Walrushead>	please take me to a hotel
<x2f>	pingfloyd, the thing is
<Walrushead>	taxi
<Estr>	maybe when you're sober it would be cool
<Walrushead>	taxi?!
<princefakhan>	tortib: well it was not the money for those minds that mattered
<x2f>	your rational mind says "-
<Time-Warp>	OVER 9000
<tortib>	princefakhan, what?
<pingfloyd>	x2f: it's not a news flash that their are dickhead ops on irc
<pingfloyd>	*there
<Estr>	x2f, then you prob found a shitty server
<Estr>	pingfloyd, he's talking about a mc server :P
<klixa>	x2f: ive been banned in here many times... it happens... people get banned... sometimes its fair sometimes its not... but whatever
<x2f>	your rational mind says "They are just internet people, why does that matter? THey don't even know you, get over it"
<bazhang>	minecraft?
<tortib>	I got banned for advertising my business lol
<pingfloyd>	midnight commander?
<x2f>	but emotions say "OMG EVERYONE HATES ME"
<tortib>	even though I did get two new customers from here.
<Estr>	pingfloyd, minecraft
<Time-Warp>	MINECRAFT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<pingfloyd>	oh minecraft?  even more reason not to care
<princefakhan>	umm! I can't catch up tortib. better not talk about it.
<princefakhan>	:P
<Time-Warp>	oh snap
<x2f>	it's a scumbag op with a mental illness probably... i hope...
<klixa>	x2f: that one person doesnt like you is all
<pingfloyd>	x2f: it's just a game
<Time-Warp>	those spiders on minecraft are evil!!!!
<klixa>	no one likes everyone
<bazhang>	x2f, move on

<Time-Warp>	and you build a window right
<Time-Warp>	and you see angry ass spider
<klixa>	i need to play minecraft
<tortib>	klixa, massage my scalp pls
<pingfloyd>	x2f: get over and go on a server with less dickheads.  Problem solved.
<klixa>	tortib: no
<Time-Warp>	x2f: why dont you hack it
<tortib>	klixa, why?  I asked please.
<Estr>	x2f, But the thing about me is that I  got an urge to always talk to someone, so things like that can make me slightly depressed
<Time-Warp>	x2f: and bring fear to the comunity
<klixa>	tortib:i shodulnt have to explain why
<Time-Warp>	and they will praise you as a leader
<Time-Warp>	bowing at your h4xor skrills
<Estr>	thats why I'm on irc
<tortib>	klixa, it isn't inappropriate

<hacker>	bazhang: oh I remember though
<bazhang>	hacker lets start with nicks beginning with 'h'
<pingfloyd>	anything goes, maybe in a suburban way

<klixa>	funkentelechrxp: depends
<klixa>	differet ops and have different lines
<pingfloyd>	funkentelechrxp: you just haven't been around long enough
<hacker>	bazhang: What did I do to be kicked?
<artwoodwork>	check out #uncyclopedia
<bazhang>	funkentelechrxp, its not an OS support channel, so there is that
<artwoodwork>	pretty much anything goes there
<klixa>	artwoodwork: from personal expereince, i gurantee you that is not true!
<artwoodwork>	although linux talk is a daily occurance
<funkentelechrxp>	pingfloyd: maybe not...been on irc 20 years, but only a few years for freenode...not much time in ##chat tho
<hacker>	or, for you to even say that?
<pingfloyd>	or #politics where the more loonier the more it goes

<funkentelechrxp>	ok, so no one else is excited. well, im excited. they're too expensive to play around with now, but prices will hopefully come down fast in the next year or two
<pingfloyd>	Walrushead: it has no rules, so it ends up in stupid ground pound fights.  So entertaining.

<Walrushead>	my final answer
<BillyPi>	my gf is fiancee is breaking up with me cuse I left her at a subway station by herself
<BillyPi>	even thouhg she straight up told me she didn't want to see me

<pingfloyd>	looks like you blew it
<bazhang>	take some root beer
<BillyPi>	and she wanted me to
<BillyPi>	so i just left her there lol
<princefakhan>	huh! not a bit sleepy
<pingfloyd>	BillyPi: she probably looks at that like you're extorting her through security
<pingfloyd>	and she wouldn't be wrong
<BillyPi>	well this isn't nyc lol
<BillyPi>	she's totally fine
<pingfloyd>	excuses aren't going to change the result
<bazhang>	nyc is safe
<princefakhan>	looks like this gonna happen only when my device runs out of juice
<pingfloyd>	if anything, they'll just dig you deeper
<BillyPi>	pingfloyd, well i left her cuse i'm not going to follow her
<BillyPi>	that's not particulartly many either
<bazhang>	are you in Detroit
<BillyPi>	wtf was i goign to do? cry and wet my pants?
<BillyPi>	toronto
<pingfloyd>	maybe if wise up, you have a chance to salvage it
<pingfloyd>	you shouldn't have left her by herself
<pingfloyd>	even if she's being a bitch, you want to make sure she's safe
<pingfloyd>	whatever she was worked up over to say that, she'll get over it, but leaving her for the wolves, not so much so.
<pingfloyd>	seems like you don't understand women much
<BillyPi>	yeh but it's kind of embarassing
<BillyPi>	girls can raise an epic stink
<BillyPi>	and they WANT you to conform to them
<pingfloyd>	security is the top thing for them.
<bazhang>	wth are you talking about
<BillyPi>	yeh but i ain't commited to her bs
<bazhang>	to leave someone at night in an empty subway station, thats cold
<pingfloyd>	what's that got to do with leaving her stranded
<BillyPi>	lol whatever
<bazhang>	no not whatever
<pingfloyd>	what if she ended up getting raped or something
<bazhang>	its cold
<BillyPi>	she got off the station and told me not to follow her
<BillyPi>	so i left
<pingfloyd>	then how you would feel over the petty squabble?
<pingfloyd>	or disagreement
<bazhang>	what a maroon
<BillyPi>	this is petty squabble imo
<BillyPi>	i ain't following her
<pingfloyd>	she was testing you :P
<BillyPi>	i ain't saying sorry
<princefakhan>	that is cold.
<pingfloyd>	women do that

<BillyPi>	uh yea
<pingfloyd>	BillyPi: you epic failed the test
<BillyPi>	doubt that pingfloyd. i would've failed if i kept following her
<BillyPi>	i know i was in the right with the argument
<bazhang>	bp must have me on ignore
<BillyPi>	bazhang, nah
<pingfloyd>	being right is so important
<bazhang>	OH WELL
<princefakhan>	though is there any guideline to what women mean when they something according to time, situtauin and mood
<pingfloyd>	what is being right getting you now?
<BillyPi>	the point is to make each other better people
<BillyPi>	she learns a lesson, i learn mine
<pingfloyd>	following her isn't conceding defeat either
<BillyPi>	yes it is
<pingfloyd>	it's showing that you can think beyond the pettiness
<BillyPi>	she's not retarded, she'll make it home
<BillyPi>	it's principle
<bazhang>	time for lesson number two
<pingfloyd>	seems like your insecurity cost you a fiance
<pingfloyd>	but hey, "you're right!"
<princefakhan>	BillyPi: don't you think you talked a lot about her on an irc.
<pingfloyd>	yeah, like rationalizing to irc is going to bring her back
<BillyPi>	i just needed to vent a bit is all
<BillyPi>	i would die for her
<bazhang>	s/vent/whine/
<Walrushead>	we were talking in another channel
<BillyPi>	yeh well clearly none of you have these problems
<Walrushead>	about whether there was a Harry Potter version of the CIA
<bazhang>	of being idjits? nope
<princefakhan>	but I don't think this was big enough that you talk about it for hours
<princefakhan>	not that you shouldn't Billypi.
<princefakhan>	but I honestly think it would have vented out by now.
<CHVNX>	 
<pingfloyd>	I doubt she thinks you would die for her, considering you left her stranded at a subway station in NYC
<bazhang>	even worse toronto
<BillyPi>	lol yeh toronto
<princefakhan>	pingfloyd: that's what I was thinking
<CHVNX>	What's so bad about Toronto?
<BillyPi>	it was in a hippie station
<pingfloyd>	saying you would and actions are two different things.  Everyone says things.
<BillyPi>	she pushed me off man
<BillyPi>	she got off, i tried to stop her
<BillyPi>	and she pushed me off
<BillyPi>	cuse i was pissed that she was so lazy all the time, which she is

<redlegion>	who doesn't love vilification of their mighty e-peen?
<bazhang>	it should be perma-topic'd here
<redlegion>	i guess
<redlegion>	seems more like a power-trip knee jerk reaction to trolls or people with differing opinions
<princefakhan>	http://xkcd.com/699/
<princefakhan>	whats a trimester
<AnTi_MTtr>	lol bazhang i never saw that before
<AnTi_MTtr>	but its definately soemthing more people should read
<princefakhan>	oh! it sure should be.
<princefakhan>	I think edit chat topic maybe.
<bazhang>	simple rejoinder to those claiming 'frespech!!11'
<AnTi_MTtr>	or even better they could take a poli sci or civics class
<AnTi_MTtr>	and that'd teach them the same thing
<bazhang>	heh yeah
<redlegion>	bazhang: not really, it's more a reminder that people love echo chambers
<princefakhan>	hehe.
<bazhang>	the author of xkcd is a lot smarter than us
<redlegion>	well, that's blantantly obvious in his choice of stick figures
<princefakhan>	http://xkcd.com/1253/
<princefakhan>	well he is actually. read this one.
<redlegion>	it's far more efficient to use stick figures to express a point than it is to illustrate scenes in detail
<bazhang>	accusing him of the above is so far off the mark, you nearly circle around again to hit 'correct'
<bazhang>	xkcd rage, thats a new one
<bazhang>	he should make a strip of it
<princefakhan>	does this happen with u guys too. u get a link to xkcd and then u r just randomly reading srips for half an hour
<bazhang>	oh yeah
<Walrushead>	no, but I feel happy for you
<Cirrus_Minor>	no
<princefakhan>	and then realize: a lot xkcd for today.
<princefakhan>	I'm smart enough for today.
<redlegion>	i can enjoy xkcd comics, but people who treat them like scripture are jackasses
<redlegion>	it's entertainment
<Walrushead>	I like xkcd, but I don't click the random button THAT much
<pingfloyd>	lol
<pingfloyd>	it's the stick figure picture bible!
<princefakhan>	oh! well someone is with me.
<princefakhan>	xD
<redlegion>	xkcd doesn't condone asshole forum or IRC admins
<bazhang>	yes, this is the church of xkcd
<pingfloyd>	redlegion: you speak blasphemy!
<redlegion>	lol
<redlegion>	pingfloyd: shhh
<Walrushead>	this is the church of scientology for all I fucking know

<bazhang>	where
<honey>	there
<princefakhan>	bazhang: ya talkin to me right.
<bazhang>	guess
<honey>	no. mary poppins.
<princefakhan>	on the irc client. or server.
<bazhang>	yes
<princefakhan>	on the irc client. or server. that's where.
<honey>	what you trying to do?
<bazhang>	correct
<princefakhan>	what does that mean.
<bazhang>	you asked, the answer is yes
<princefakhan>	connectio reset by peer
<wowaname>	.
<honey>	hmmm
<honey>	its you.
<honey>	lol
<princefakhan>	thats a good point wowaname
<bazhang>	a five second bing result:
<wowaname>	ty
<CHVNX>	I tend to agree with wowaname.
<honey>	didnt i ban you? lo l
<honey>	not sure why. lol
<wowaname>	because you threw a fit
<honey>	maybe cause you didnt answer me.
<bazhang>	why bring that drama here
<wowaname>	maybe because im afk
<honey>	this isnt drama ffs.
<honey>	its 5 lines of chat
<CHVNX>	It's taking up my screenspace. It offends me.
<honey>	lol.
<princefakhan>	lol haha.
<princefakhan>	I have been on this channel for hours. I assure you. it all was drama.
<princefakhan>	it always will be drama
<bazhang>	way too much cross channel drama
<honey>	are you kidding me?
<bazhang>	such quit message
<princefakhan>	I think the bits and pieces of the drama that come from other chans should bring with them the previous rant about it.
<Entalyan>	Well, when there's drama in another channel, they'll declare it offtopic, and refer you to the channel generally accepted as the global offtopic channel, which is this one :p Cross-channel drama here is kindof unavoidable :p
<bazhang>	much gtav
<princefakhan>	so atleast the people have clue what drama it is.
<bazhang>	princefakhan, worst irc advice of all time
<bazhang>	bravo
<princefakhan>	hmmm. right.
<princefakhan>	we were avoiding cross channel drama.
<bazhang>	imagine every single nutter channel all bringing their rants to a single channel
<wowaname>	##rant
<princefakhan>	looks like I was turned to evil by Satan
<honey>	would like one of my rants? lol

<princefakhan>	yeah. I had a talk once about space elevators with my bro.
<princefakhan>	they are pretty interesting.
<princefakhan>	I don't remember how they work tho
<princefakhan>	how does it escape the earths gravity
<treefiddy_>	it goes up, it goes down, you can't explain that
<pingfloyd>	getting into orbit is what is insanely expensive because of trying to get all the needed resources into as lite of a package as possible.  Most of those resources being spent just getting into orbit.
<bazhang>	arthur c clarke was the inventor in question
<princefakhan>	a rocket goes up and comes down too.
<princefakhan>	a practitcal elevator too. it needs some kind of push.
<treefiddy_>	the tides come in, the tides go out. you can't explain that
<bazhang>	sure you can
<treefiddy_>	I know
<princefakhan>	you can. the moon's gravity
<treefiddy_>	that's a real quote from Bill O'Reilley
<pingfloyd>	we should be building more space stations also and creating efficient systems of circulating supplies to orbit.
<Estr>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wDFwo5GA80&feature=youtu.be
<Entalyan>	Probably magnets
<pingfloyd>	supply drops don't have to be manned either
<pingfloyd>	all you have to worry about that point is rotating staff out of zero g
<treefiddy_>	once you get to the top of the elevator how do you get up to orbital speed?
<princefakhan>	the most practical use ryt now is supply drops to space I think.
<princefakhan>	we don't really do anything else in space.
<Skizzerz>	well even if you could just get an elevator into the stratosphere or closer to the tropopause, and build a launchpad up there, you'd greatly reduce the amount of fuel needed to escape Earth
<pingfloyd>	you can combine all of these methodologies
<bazhang>	did you mean escape velocity
<bazhang>	'orbital speed'
<pingfloyd>	it becomes about building up the infrastructure to support it economically
<treefiddy_>	escaping gravity isn't hard, you can use balloons for that
<treefiddy_>	it's getting up to speed that's an issue
<bazhang>	you appear to have nearly no knowledge of things orbital
<treefiddy_>	then enlighten me
<bazhang>	you are quoting o'reilly as well
<Entalyan>	treefiddy_: When attached to the earths surface you would already be going at a speed that provides a geostationary orbit
<treefiddy_>	for humor
<bazhang>	wasting others time is not my idea of humor
<treefiddy_>	you're in a social channel. the whole concept is wasting time
<x2f>	7:50 PM <x2f> Jeez, people become assholes behind keyboards
<x2f>	7:50 PM <x2f> even if they wouldn't hurt a fly in the real world
<bazhang>	wrong
<princefakhan>	people do a lot good things behind keyboards.
<pingfloyd>	I think we're going to stay in the dark about many things until we become more spacefaring
<grant>	Estr you dualsport?
<bazhang>	randal monroe said something about that x2f
<Estr>	grant, no
<Entalyan>	They don't 'become', the just feel free to unleash the inner asshole that was always within
<Estr>	I'm getting a motorcycle after summer or something though
<x2f>	i wonder how many of the mean people in the world are mean like that in real life too
<bazhang>	what cc
<grant>	Estr what kind
<x2f>	*mean people on the internet
<grant>	Estr I am getting a KLR
<Estr>	Just a 125 :V
<princefakhan>	Estr: motorcycles are cool.
<x2f>	because i always feel like the victim on the internet
<Estr>	not sure what kind yet
<bazhang>	a scooter then
<princefakhan>	I have one.
<pingfloyd>	like we need space to become a new driving force and challenge, along with its new discoveries, to reach higher levels in science.  Like the seas once were to man.
<pingfloyd>	new discoveries brought on renaissance in thinking
<Estr>	hoping for an aprilia rs though or something
<Estr>	then i can take out the restriction
<Estr>	get about 40hp
<Estr>	while the actual limit is 15
<Estr>	which makes it illegal, but bleh
<bazhang>	125cc restriction?
<grant>	Estr why not dualsport?
<princefakhan>	aprilia looks cool.
<Estr>	idk the words in english so sorry if it doesn't sound properly
<Estr>	grant, because im poor and i cant afford it
<bazhang>	the english is fine, just not at what level the restriction is
<bazhang>	some make it 150cc for example
<grant>	49cc is the restriction here
<Estr>	a 125cc doesnt have a restriction of hp but its a restriction on hp
<bazhang>	criminy thats slow
<Estr>	15 is what is legal
<princefakhan>	what type of restriction. the one set by government
<Estr>	everything over 125cc and 15hp is illegal
<Estr>	and i meant the restriction in the pot
<Estr>	you take that out and you get more hp
<princefakhan>	there is pretty much no reestriction here on bikes.
<bazhang>	I think its something like 5000cc here
<princefakhan>	I have 160cc.
<Estr>	5000cc
<Estr>	does those exist..?
<princefakhan>	people these days have 220 cc bikes.
<bazhang>	racing bikes
<princefakhan>	5000 cc?
<princefakhan>	or 500
<bazhang>	echo echo echo
<bazhang>	5 0 0 0
<bazhang>	shall I type slower
<Estr>	125cc is whats legal for me
<Estr>	as im 16
<pingfloyd>	there's 2 stroke 125ccs that get 40 hp
<Estr>	when im 18 i can get 500 i think, not sure and when im 21 i can get whatever
<princefakhan>	oh! I think there is a 125 cc restriction on miors heere too.
<Estr>	pingfloyd, yes, aprilia rs is a 2 stroke
<pingfloyd>	princefakhan: if it's just a cc restriction, there's plenty of room for insanity in there
<princefakhan>	haha. I think.
<pingfloyd>	look at some of the 125cc dirt bikes there are
<princefakhan>	300 cc on road bikes here seem dangerous.
<princefakhan>	but people buy them. and they sell them.
<honey>	night all.
<princefakhan>	well mine outruns a 180 cc. so yeah.
<princefakhan>	it must be hp
<princefakhan>	good night honey
<pingfloyd>	there's more than size to it though, like there's those 750s that are just a street bike, and then there are those ones that are total insanity to get on.
<bazhang>	or nitrous
<Estr>	and you got a 125 princefakhan ?
<princefakhan>	I have 160cc.
<pingfloyd>	it's like if you buy a crotch rocket, how do you drive it anything but crazy?
<Estr>	what bike do u have?
<princefakhan>	TVS Apache RTR 160
<pingfloyd>	and if you somehow do, how do constantly not give into the temptation?
<bazhang>	crazy is the reason
<bazhang>	you're not taking that bumper-carting
<pingfloyd>	anytime you see someone on one of those, you know they have a short life expectancy
<princefakhan>	gotta say. u only drive crazy.
<pingfloyd>	the question is will they sell the bike first

*	eir removes channel operator status from eir
<bazhang>	the next trend will be to append wheels to a coffin
<Estr>	Never even heard about about tvs lol
<princefakhan>	bazhang: lol
<pingfloyd>	Munsters style
<pingfloyd>	the Munster hog
<princefakhan>	that's cuz it may only be in india
<bazhang>	save shipping and funeral costs
<Estr>	looks like a better version of an cbf
<pingfloyd>	just dig a hole and throw the "bike" in it
<princefakhan>	honda cbf?
<Estr>	yes
<princefakhan>	we have many CBRs here.
<bazhang>	should be called 'cbfw'
<princefakhan>	didn't see any CBF.
<princefakhan>	they may be available though.
<princefakhan>	India is one of the biggest markets for bikes.
<Estr>	meh, not a fan of CBRs
<Estr>	or honda in general tbh
<pingfloyd>	I'd rather have a street cruiser
<princefakhan>	me too.
<bazhang>	yamaha is where its at
<bazhang>	50 percent off in china
<princefakhan>	in the meantime: http://xkcd.com/349/
<Estr>	man all my friends got like completly new YZFs, Duke's, MTs, aprilia's
<princefakhan>	we have some shit duke bikes here too.
<bazhang>	they  have a knockoff factory that does such close replicas, they had to bring in yamaha engineers to spot the difference
<princefakhan>	bazhang: whaat! lol!
<Estr>	yo
<Estr>	its china
<Estr>	what do you expect?
<pingfloyd>	China is master of knockoff
<Estr>	Like everything in china is replicated
<princefakhan>	I have heard they have knock off for Boeings too.
<bazhang>	these were perfect
<pingfloyd>	they have knockoffs of knockoffs even
<bazhang>	the uPhone
<pingfloyd>	they're not big into reinventing the wheel
<bazhang>	and the uPhone has no drm
<princefakhan>	and then sell it in India.
<pingfloyd>	sounds like a selling point
<princefakhan>	dudes here be like yo, iPhone.
<bazhang>	who wouldnt want to get half off
<Estr>	bazhang, yo, get me a cheap iphone from china
<bazhang>	for a product that is less encumbered
<Estr>	i just broke mine
<pingfloyd>	dudes in chine be like, "all your appstore are belong to us"
<princefakhan>	how about 80%
<bazhang>	alibaba should have some
<princefakhan>	true. I would rather buy an iPhone knockoff
<pingfloyd>	I don't mind it as long is had battery safety
<pingfloyd>	you don't mess around with lithium ion
<bazhang>	they turn out something like 100k engineers a year, but for original product design, they have to import foreign engineers
<princefakhan>	pingfloyd: good luck.
<princefakhan>	li-ion is eerywhere
<pingfloyd>	princefakhan: yeah, but in most cases the engineers put in protection
<princefakhan>	They don't.
<pingfloyd>	to avoid potential catastrophic failure where it blows up
<princefakhan>	80% off remember.
<pingfloyd>	I don't know about in china
<princefakhan>	were u talking about iPhones.
<pingfloyd>	but main brands, they at least have the basic protection logic
<pingfloyd>	also chemically they've gotten safer over the years

<y0wza>	wel
<artwoodwork>	lol at floyd's trainer talking shit
<artwoodwork>	oh it's his dad
<artwoodwork>	lmao
<pingfloyd>	lenny: I'm watching Lucio Fulci's Zombie right now
<pingfloyd>	if you were watching that, then you'd be even more freaked out because that just the sort of shit that movie has
<pingfloyd>	you'll be that guy that gets up all huffy and says, "Gaww!! okay get in here!" then open the door and a zombie lunges and bites out your neck.
<lenny>	lol
<pingfloyd>	and the cat just watches it happen...
<pingfloyd>	while hiding under the bed
<lenny>	my cat hides under my bed all the time
<pingfloyd>	see
<pingfloyd>	better have the machete ready just in case
<demonchicken>	bawk
<lenny>	anyway i'm going to sleep. g'night
<lenny>	going to be disconnected in 2 hours because irccloud
<pingfloyd>	in this movie, this one zombie pulled this lady through the window and her eye right into a broken board
<pingfloyd>	and then then the board broke off as he pulled her outside
<demonchicken>	O_o
<Mmango>	sometimes i feel like there's nobody out there...
<Mmango>	go on
<Mmango>	sometimes i feel like into intointointoitnotinit the night rabbit watches
<pingfloyd>	people are always so dumb in horror movies.  Are you just going to stand there all paralyzed when you see a rotting corpse coming out of the ground?
<artwoodwork>	we're all the same thing Mmango
<artwoodwork>	alone
<artwoodwork>	watching the boxing fight on irc
<Mmango>	haha
<pingfloyd>	and why do they always wander away from the group out of nowhere?
<pingfloyd>	and on a whim
<pingfloyd>	I think lemmings are even smarter than that
<sabotender>	moo 🐮
<sabotender>	pingfloyd: are you watching the fight?
<pingfloyd>	no
<sabotender>	aww
*	sabotender hugs pingfloyd anyway
<sabotender>	o/
<sabotender>	whatcha doing
<Mmango>	whatcha say
<artwoodwork>	oohm whatcha saaay
<sabotender>	pingfloyd: well..i hope you are doing well
<artwoodwork>	1st rule of boxing: ALWAYS bet on the black guy
<sabotender>	mayweather might have won..the fight is over
<sabotender>	only the judges will tell
<artwoodwork>	he won
<sabotender>	you reckon? :-P
<artwoodwork>	he played the system from 6 years ago for this fight
<artwoodwork>	he's the new england patriots of boxing
<sabotender>	pacquiao looked winded in round 5 and mayweather still looked fresh
<sabotender>	artwoodwork: what does that mean?
<artwoodwork>	it was all legal, but not really moral or fair
<artwoodwork>	but I can't argue that since i'm a pats fan
<artwoodwork>	he played the system
<sabotender>	...and I am a Manchester United fan :-P
<sabotender>	I dont know what playing the system means
<sabotender>	sounds like Mayweaher won, by total successful punches
<artwoodwork>	you need to know the whole story from years ago
<artwoodwork>	pacquiaoaosusu wanted to fight him 6 years ago
<artwoodwork>	mayweather made excuses all the time not to
<artwoodwork>	he waited until his oppenent got a bit soft
<sabotender>	you mean older?
<artwoodwork>	then dictated the conditions and class to fight him
<artwoodwork>	no mayweather is older
<pingfloyd>	that's what you get to do when you're the champ
<artwoodwork>	now he can beat more women!
<artwoodwork>	what a guy
<pingfloyd>	the champ is giving the challenger an opportunity
<artwoodwork>	he won because he was smart; not because he was a better fighter
<sabotender>	mayweather won it
<pingfloyd>	mayweather beats up women?
*	banzaikitten is now known as kanzaibitten
<artwoodwork>	UM
<artwoodwork>	UM I GOT ONE MORE FIGHT
<artwoodwork>	UM
<artwoodwork>	UM
<tallguy>	jail in '11 for wife bashing
<artwoodwork>	MY WATCH COMPANY
<artwoodwork>	UM
<sabotender>	one thing I never understood. Why do they 'thank god' for winning the fight?
<artwoodwork>	I'M BLESSED
<artwoodwork>	UM
<artwoodwork>	MONEY
<pingfloyd>	because they think they're special
<pingfloyd>	and that god intervenes for them
<artwoodwork>	PLUGGING THINGS THAT MAKE ME MONEY
<artwoodwork>	UM
<artwoodwork>	UM
<sabotender>	do they really think that (if such a diety exists) such a being watches sports and says, hmm I think this person is going to win though my divine intervention.
<pingfloyd>	if there is a god, I doubt you manage a system on an individual basis, it's bound to be more like being an admin.
<Audioburn_work>	who won the fight guise
<sabotender>	mayweather
<artwoodwork>	god especially likes people who throw balls
<sabotender>	of course
<pingfloyd>	I bet god even believes in GIGO
<sabotender>	lol
<pingfloyd>	maybe GIGO is the god of all gods
<pingfloyd>	nobody escapes
<pingfloyd>	gigo
<pingfloyd>	yeah, god cares a lot about fights that people bet money on
<artwoodwork>	i hope they go have a sundae together
<pingfloyd>	the dollar bill told me so
<pingfloyd>	it says in god we trust
<artwoodwork>	vegas is probably going to put up 10 new hotels based on the earning of this fight
<klekowskii>	hello
<artwoodwork>	THANK YOU GOD FOR THIS SPORTING EVENT
<klekowskii>	anyone has an online link that works ?
<artwoodwork>	ONLY GOD SPONSORED BY UNDER ARMOR AND RED BULL
<pingfloyd>	I think he left his reserved front row seat empty
<artwoodwork>	a like to what klekowskii
<artwoodwork>	link?
<artwoodwork>	it's over
<pingfloyd>	Sponsored by god and the letter S
<pingfloyd>	because god cares so much about who the champions are
<pingfloyd>	I think if he gave a shit he's be more like Cesar about it
<pingfloyd>	throw them in there and see which ones are left standing
<pingfloyd>	wonder if he gave this match a thumbs up or a thumbs down
<Fowler>	Bad fight
<pingfloyd>	if this were times of ancient Rome, they'd be saying "Thank you Cesar!"
<Fowler>	Bad bad fight
<Fowler>	Terrible fight
<pingfloyd>	if they thanked god instead, they'd probably be thrown to the lions
<Fowler>	klekowskii: Fight's over
<pingfloyd>	maybe it was an unofficial exhibition match
<Fowler>	Wasn't close
<CosmicWitch>	WELTERWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WORLD!
<caselogic>	hey Fowler
<caselogic>	hi CosmicWitch
<Fowler>	Yo
<caselogic>	Fowler, did you watch the fight?
<funkentelechrxp>	what is a welter
*	caselogic shows funkentelechrxp his welter.
<pingfloyd>	A welterweight boxer's weight is greater than 63.5 kg (140 lb), but not greater than 67 kg (147 lb).
<funkentelechrxp>	nah, not welterweight...welter
<funkentelechrxp>	wtf is the etymology of welter
<pingfloyd>	the internet is amazing
<funkentelechrxp>	why dont they say lightweight
<caselogic>	welter do
<Fowler>	caselogic: Yeah
<Fowler>	It sucked
<caselogic>	Fowler, how much did you spend to see it?
<Fowler>	$0
<caselogic>	no great loss than
<pingfloyd>	but you still wasted your time
<pingfloyd>	the price would be more like insult to injury
<Fowler>	First six rounds were good
<caselogic>	Fowler did not have anything better to do
<Fowler>	But then Floyd just dominated
<Fowler>	It was pathetic
<caselogic>	clippers beat spurs tonight, will play rockets in semi-finals
<sabotender>	okay then what is a featherweight? is that even a thing?
<sabotender>	I think i would be a featherweight :-P
<sabotender>	weighing in at a cool 9.28 stone
<sabotender>	Hmm. I've lost some weight. I shouldn't lose any more or else I'll blow away in the slightest breeze
<pingfloyd>	no idea how heavy a stone is
<sabotender>	oh um. I weigh about 130lbs
<caselogic>	height?
<pingfloyd>	that's light
<pingfloyd>	how tall are you?
<totem>	THE BABY IS A GIRL!!!
<totem>	kate and william baby's
<pingfloyd>	who?
<pingfloyd>	who is kate and william?
<pingfloyd>	is that your Fred and Ethel?
<totem>	MI-6 owner
<pingfloyd>	what?
<sabotender>	caselogic:  eh about 179cm
<sabotender>	i think more accurately its 177.8cm
*	sabotender hugs hmir 
<sabotender>	so yeah, I am skinny :-D
<caselogic>	im fat
<pingfloyd>	what's that in feet and inches?
<sabotender>	bah, must I do all the conversions myself?
<sabotender>	I don't know that off hand
<pingfloyd>	I'm 5'7" 150-160lbs
<sabotender>	it's about 5ft 10in tall
<pingfloyd>	that's really light then
<sabotender>	i'm average height for a bloke
<pingfloyd>	you must be really skinny
<pingfloyd>	I'm average build
<sabotender>	I told you that I am
<pingfloyd>	the whole BMI scale is bullshit anyway
<sabotender>	I never use that
<Fowler>	Not for populations
<pingfloyd>	especially when they try to make correlation to health
<sabotender>	totem: you know, I really couldn't care less that the people in the royal family are having sex and procreating. Wow, so they can do something that 5 billion other people can do. Big accomplishment
<sabotender>	How about stopping at two and not contributing to the overpopulation problem?
<pingfloyd>	did they have their servants help them?
<pingfloyd>	give them coaching and step by step instruction?
<pingfloyd>	who cares what royalty and celebrities do
<pingfloyd>	they're all boring and privileged people
<sabotender>	agreed. I have my own problems to deal with to be worried about other people's
<pingfloyd>	I can understand being a fan of someone's work though
<pingfloyd>	like maybe you like an actor or musician because of their work
<pingfloyd>	let's take the Kardashians as an example
<sabotender>	well that's different. But being a fan of someone having a bairn is a bit ridiculous.
<totem>	sabotender, please obey your prince. ®
<pingfloyd>	wtf have they ever done that was worth a shit
<Fowler>	At least Floyd didn't just say, "Manny is a fucking scrub, the fight wasn't even close and I knew it wouldn't be, imdabes fuck you"
<Fowler>	Crap
<Fowler>	Wrong channel
<Fowler>	Can't swear in here
<pingfloyd>	except have drama over wrong sized sweaters
<artwoodwork>	can someone explain what this whole "princess" thing means
<pingfloyd>	artwoodwork: some context
<artwoodwork>	are we in a storybook?
<tallguy>	I hoped that Pacquiao would win, but I saw that he didnot
<caselogic>	tallguy, dur
<artwoodwork>	yeah who cares, boxing is a dying sport
<Fowler>	tallguy: wasnt even close
<tallguy>	alas that is true
<pingfloyd>	tallguy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyRliaitQWs
<sabotender>	lol, they did more dancing in the ring than anything
<artwoodwork>	gaming online and streaming really shows your pecs these days
<artwoodwork>	donate to my stream
<artwoodwork>	my mom doesn't fund me
<sabotender>	they made the rounds stretch out far and long so they could appease the people who paid a lot for their seats
<sabotender>	and i hear that the PPV was about 100USD
*	sabotender eyerolls. 
<sabotender>	waste of money, lol. I'd rather use that and pay some bills.
<artwoodwork>	yes and 20-30 at a pub to watch
<artwoodwork>	idiots
<sabotender>	I caught it on a live free french stream.

<pingfloyd>	sometimes you can guess the year a movie came out accurately just by observing it's choices in cliche plot devices.
<hmir>	Not always.
<Foxhoundz>	is it worth leaving a job for a 5k raise?
<hmir>	Do you have job security at the new job?
<pingfloyd>	Foxhoundz: you want random advice for that decision?
<Foxhoundz>	pingfloyd: yes
<Foxhoundz>	I'm at an impasse
<DoverMo>	burnt my tongue an now i have crackers stuck in my teeth1
<DoverMo>	!
<sheep>	Foxhoundz: are you guaranteed the new job?  would you have to move?
<DoverMo>	so it hurts when i try to dislodge the crackers
<pingfloyd>	depends how much you like your current job
<DoverMo>	i'm gonna fucking die
<Foxhoundz>	no moving, and I've already got the job offer

<princefakhan>	hhmmm: oh! something like that.
<princefakhan>	there is ubuntu 15 now.
<geektech713>	ya
<princefakhan>	oh yes. there was a big update recently.
<princefakhan>	it was all over the tech web
<geektech713>	i didnt  notice any difference
<princefakhan>	there was something that was highlighted a bit.
<princefakhan>	i dont remember correctly, something like moving from or to systemd
<hhmmm>	just realised my desktop has hardly changed in 3 years
<princefakhan>	don't wth is that.
<princefakhan>	hhmmm: uh! what are u using
<hhmmm>	systemd is the bees' knees
<hhmmm>	debian openbox
<hhmmm>	:p
<princefakhan>	I'm on debian too. not on my desktop though.
<princefakhan>	Maemo Fremantle
<hhmmm>	woah that's a phone thing right?
<princefakhan>	yeah it is.
<geektech713>	it is big drag that Steam left Ubuntu since with SteamOS
<princefakhan>	I want to switch to linux because of this device.
<princefakhan>	I can only flash this phone from windows.
<geektech713>	can just buy an android phone
<princefakhan>	and not the other cool stuff like compile a program maybe.
<princefakhan>	geektech713: was steam ever related to ubuntu
<geektech713>	yes
<geektech713>	it came on ubuntu first
<princefakhan>	Idk, maybe. I'm just in love with this device. all the openness.
<princefakhan>	oh!
<geektech713>	then SteamOS came out year later
<geektech713>	I havent had too much luck with Windows Phone 8
<princefakhan>	ahh! I get it now. Steam on linux was released on Ubuntu first. is that so?
<princefakhan>	win phones are good imo.
<princefakhan>	but wait once win10 comes out.
<geektech713>	i know..i had a few windows phone
<clarjon1>	princefakhan: they polled the community to find out which distro had the most interested users, sot hey could focus on creating a package to get the most amount of testers right away
<clarjon1>	ubuntu won out
<geektech713>	ya ubuntu has big users base
<princefakhan>	clarjon1: oh! thanks for clearing it up.
<princefakhan>	yeah. one who has not used linux or doesn't know much about it surely knows about ubuntu.
<princefakhan>	clarjon1: so steam on ubuntu never reached final phase I guess.
<Phase>	.
<clarjon1>	haha
<Phase>	sup
<Phase>	lol
<clarjon1>	Phase: well, it's in the official repos.
<clarjon1>	er
<princefakhan>	phase: that's a great point
<clarjon1>	princefakhan:
<Phase>	thanks princefakhan :O
<hhmmm>	don't invoke hitler :p
<princefakhan>	:)
*	Phase waves to clarjon1
*	clarjon1 waves to Phase 
<clarjon1>	But yeah, SteamOS is the same software as Steam For Linux
<clarjon1>	it's just a distro that Valve created that boots into it directly
<clarjon1>	less stuff to eat up resources running, to maximize game performance.
<Phase>	I am doing the most boring shit ever
<Phase>	rep grinding in wow
<princefakhan>	hmmm. well I think steamos would make a great home streaming device.
<princefakhan>	what is wow?
<clarjon1>	princefakhan: Especially if you install Kodi.
<Phase>	world of warcraft
<princefakhan>	clarjon1: kodi?
<clarjon1>	princefakhan: Used to be called "XBMC" -- it's a media center application
<geektech713>	kodi is old XBMC
<princefakhan>	phase: explains why u r on the channel. :P
<princefakhan>	ahh!
<Phase>	lol
<LauraCottonTail>	hi
<clarjon1>	and the steam overlay works great with it, so you can chat with your friends while watching stuff on the big screen easily
<Phase>	sup LarryTheLobster
<Phase>	er
<Phase>	LauraCottonTail
<princefakhan>	well then would people rather not install xmbc
<princefakhan>	heyllo LauraCottonTail
<geektech713>	hi laura
<clarjon1>	XBMC is the old project name, and releases named that are, well, old, and missing features that the newer Kodi releases have.
<clarjon1>	so, depending on your hardware, you could go either way
<geektech713>	XBMC was named Xbox Media Center at one time
<princefakhan>	huh!
<geektech713>	that is XBMC stands for
<clarjon1>	Yup, it started out as a bit of software to make the original Xbox console play videos
<clarjon1>	and then show pictures
<clarjon1>	and it kinda snowballed from there.
<princefakhan>	anyway. it steamos also needs netflix
<LauraCottonTail>	am i in linux?
<princefakhan>	but that is gonna come out only when it gets popular
<geektech713>	nope ..lol
<clarjon1>	Hardly, i think we'd have been told that this was quite off topic if this was in there, haha.
<clarjon1>	since it's not linux support talk :P
<princefakhan>	LauraCottonTail: we are talking linux though.
<LauraCottonTail>	you just say many words i don't understand
<princefakhan>	well we are basically sayin linux fused with games

<ProXavi>	im 14
<honey>	oh stfu.
<honey>	12 having drinks?
<Bouncer>	Which is not right after sex. It's after she makes you a sammich after sex. :D
<honey>	you know what i would do to you if that was my daughter?
<ProXavi>	No cuddling
<Bouncer>	By drinks he means sodapop.
<honey>	i sure as hell hope so.
<sheamon>	fair

<Bouncer>	Also, and this has nothing to do with anything. I apparently have either 1/2 of my head with allergies or a head cold.

<prison_>	or i'm takin half of yours
<Bouncer>	:o
<Bouncer>	Do NOT make me go all rock/paper/scissors all up in heah!
<pingfloyd>	a club sandwich sounds good right now
*	ChanServ gives voice to bazhang_
<pingfloyd>	the kind with bacon instead of ham
<sheamon>	made a club from leftover breakfast bacon yesterday. I think I ate bacon most of the day. Not to happy with myself but oh so happy
<pingfloyd>	your taste buds are happy
<Bouncer>	One must be of the bacon, from time to time.
<sheamon>	didn't toast the bread.. not sure if that's a 'Club' requirement
<pingfloyd>	bacon is like a wildcard.  It's a meat, and it's a spice
<pingfloyd>	and a million other things
<pingfloyd>	pretty much make everything better
<pingfloyd>	you've got to toast it
<pingfloyd>	but that's more of a pref thing
<Cell_vs_Gohan>	roflmao at thos nabs  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aWvdabGsuE
<Cell_vs_Gohan>	*those *
<pingfloyd>	to me that's not a club if not toasted.  Easier on the roof of your mouth though.
<honey>	depends on the bread.
<pingfloyd>	I think technically you can still consider it a club
<pingfloyd>	I think of club as meaning pork, turkey, lettuce, tomato, and mayo
<sheamon>	not sure what's required.. Sourdough?
<pingfloyd>	ideally bacon for your pork
<sheamon>	I used some soft, stick to your mouth, French bread
<pingfloyd>	french or sourdough is usually the bread
<honey>	i like melba thin rye bread
<pingfloyd>	french works
<honey>	if you know what that is.
<pingfloyd>	if it's really good bread, I can understand not toasting it
<sheamon>	Melba toast and cream cheese
<honey>	its just really really thin
<prison_>	cheeeeese
<honey>	so two slices is the same as one slice of regular bread.
<prison_>	lol
<pingfloyd>	like say home made bread, you don't toast that until it gets a little too dry
<prison_>	low car
<prison_>	b
<sheamon>	is that what makes it Melba?
<ProXavi>	Stacys mom
<sheamon>	thin
<honey>	yeah but they have melba toast thats is like a cracker
<honey>	dried.. not the fresh bread.
*	ChanServ gives channel operator status to eir
<sheamon>	yeah I've had that, not the actual bread tho
<pingfloyd>	I've had both kinds
<honey>	ah ok.
<honey>	me too. lol
*	eir removes ban on *!*@unaffiliated/irreverant
*	eir removes channel operator status from eir
<pingfloyd>	I sometimes like those rye-crisps
<honey>	yes!
<pingfloyd>	have to be in the mood for them though
<honey>	i'm addicted to pretzels lately.
<pingfloyd>	rye bread though, makes me want to have a ruben
<honey>	sour dough special dark ones.
<pingfloyd>	on marble
<honey>	lol
<honey>	are you from NY?
<pingfloyd>	no
<pingfloyd>	I'm on the other coast
<pingfloyd>	now I want a ruben
<pingfloyd>	here's the question though: thousand island or russian dressing on your ruben
<pingfloyd>	I know russian dressing is traditional
<honey>	the same thing
<prison_>	i want an italian beef
<honey>	lol
<pingfloyd>	they're similar, but they're different
<honey>	how?
<honey>	i thought they were the same
*	ProXavi tickles honey
<prison_>	pickle relish
<pingfloyd>	guess this is the diff "Russian dressing recipes typically call for mayonnaise, chili sauce or ketchup, relish, horseradish, paprika and other seasonings, making it considerably spicier and less sweet than Thousand Island dressing, with its hard-cooked egg, lemon or orange juice, cream and sweet pickle relish or olives."
<sheamon>	I assume everyone is frickin hungry now? :)
<Cell_vs_Gohan>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tACj08Hr-Xc&t=108
<Cell_vs_Gohan>	haha
<sheamon>	I'm dying
<CHVNX>	No Italian beef, but I have some Canadian sausage for ya.
<honey>	lol CHVNX
*	Cell_vs_Gohan burries sheamon 
<pingfloyd>	I bet thousand island was a fork of russian dressing
<honey>	 afork. lol
<Cell_vs_Gohan>	CHVNX: are you going to be a teacher ?
<sheamon>	the Russian dressing sounds better for the ruben.. can't say that I've had it
<CHVNX>	Cell_vs_Gohan: I hate people. I would make an excellent teacher.
<pingfloyd>	sheamon: it's good with either one, that's why it is a tough choice
<treefiddy_>	canadian bacon is flat
<Audioburn>	idioterna, how did you manage quarterly taxes?
<CHVNX>	We call it "back bacon" or "peameal bacon" here.
<treefiddy_>	you know what i dont understand
<Cell_vs_Gohan>	CHVNX: what does hating people have to do with making teachers
<Cell_vs_Gohan>	u wooy
<Cell_vs_Gohan>	*woot
<treefiddy_>	is why do i smell ammonia after i work out
<pingfloyd>	I like canadian bacon and can't stand how so many people don't know the difference between it and ham
<pingfloyd>	especially when pizza joints don't
<CHVNX>	Cell_vs_Gohan: Teachers tend to be the most cinical, hatefilled, pseudo-intellectual simpletons on the planet. They hate students. Haven't you ever been to school?
<hmir>	It's your sweat.
<pingfloyd>	they advertise canadian bacon and give you ham
<hmir>	It's got all kinds of nasty impurities in it.
<hmir>	i.e. drugs and alcohol.
<Cell_vs_Gohan>	CHVNX: not all of them
<prison_>	some teachers actually care but sooner or later they become cynical
<pingfloyd>	apparently pizza joints are bad knowing the difference between thighs and backs
<prison_>	and hate it
<CHVNX>	Cell_vs_Gohan: Most of them. More than enough to use blanket statements, such as "most teachers are too stupid to do their job, and own a huge portion of the blame for the destruction fo our civilization."
<pingfloyd>	that's as bad as not knowing the difference between dark or white meat.  People like this shouldn't be around food.
<pingfloyd>	cooking it
<Cell_vs_Gohan>	CHVNX: maybe that's the case of the singaporean teachers? :o
<treefiddy_>	prison_: i should teach a class on how to be cynical.
<hmir>	Reality tv shows are what own a huge portion of the blame for the destruction of civilization...
<Cell_vs_Gohan>	i mean why would you judge all of the world's teachers
<Cell_vs_Gohan>	that's funny
<prison_>	i should teach a class on how to not get knocked up
<prison_>	im sorry but there really is no purpose to having children
<prison_>	nothing but bullshit and a greif
<prison_>	expensive bullshit and greif
<prison_>	and then i'll teach a class on how to have fun with out kids around
<treefiddy_>	sweet
<Oddity>	:)
<hmir>	Says the dad of two boys...
<Oddity>	Yeah, I don't think everyone should have or even wants to have children, despite what society tells us
<prison_>	huh
<prison_>	i dont have kids
<alliberry>	hi hi
<hmir>	treefiddy_ is a dad of two.
<Estr>	We should all stop breeding
<Estr>	So humanity will die
<Oddity>	/r/childfree/ :3
<treefiddy_>	hmir: your notes are failing you
<prison_>	i used to sub to that sub
<pingfloyd>	some of the reality shows are okay like Dual Survival or Survivor Man
<prison_>	but hell no
<hmir>	The misanthropy is palpable.
<hmir>	treefiddy_, you don't have two sons?!?!?
<treefiddy_>	hmir nope
<prison_>	there's ad ouble standard and it is almost like "im superior because i am not doing what nature intended"
<pingfloyd>	those are more like improvised documentaries in a way
<Audioburn>	i get a really weird vibe from ben carson
<hmir>	One son one daughter?
<treefiddy_>	yes
<hmir>	two daughters?
<treefiddy_>	no
<hmir>	I know it's two kids.
<prison_>	r/childfree is like the sanctomommies without them having children
<pingfloyd>	the problem is all the crap like the Kardashians
<hmir>	I just forgot the configuration haha
<prison_>	like me, all they do is bitch about peoples' kids
<treefiddy_>	and probably at least one illegitimate kid.
<pingfloyd>	and kids being dumb and impressionable by it
<hmir>	homosex == best way to avoid pregnancy.
<Cell_vs_Gohan>	CHVNX: anyway you graduated from the teachers school and that makes you a teacha'
<prison_>	hmir i dont like chicks
<prison_>	lol treefiddy_
<idioterna>	Audioburn: i paid them :)
<treefiddy_>	i was kind of a whore when i was younger, so what
<Oddity>	cool
<pingfloyd>	prison_: you just need to meet a woman that isn't a princess
<prison_>	treefiddy_: how old is your son and does he take after you
<Audioburn>	idioterna, through what software/company/agency?

<idioterna>	Audioburn: oh i'm not from US
<Audioburn>	oh
<idioterna>	Audioburn: our version of IRS has an API for that
<hmir>	Slovenia?
<idioterna>	yes
<Audioburn>	oh wow!
<hmir>	I win!
<Audioburn>	lucky
<hmir>	Give me my watercooler!
<idioterna>	the colour TV is yours, hmir !
<hmir>	My exgf was slovakian.
<idioterna>	close enough
<pingfloyd>	I think sweet 16 birthdays are rare these days
<hmir>	I used to call her slovenian or czech all the time to piss her off.
<y0wza>	wth
<treefiddy_>	we are wild and crazy guys from czechloslovakia
<Audioburn>	idioterna, what is it called, can you give me a link? that's interesting
<hmir>	That country doesn't exist anymore.
<idioterna>	Audioburn: https://edavki.durs.si/OpenPortal/Pages/StartPage/StartPage.aspx
<hmir>	It broke up into the czech republic and Slovakia etc.
<idioterna>	Audioburn: https://edavki.durs.si/OpenPortal/Pages/Technicals/Intro.aspx are the technical docs that document the schemas
<treefiddy_>	hmir it doesnt invalidate the skit
<hmir>	But it's geographically incorrect!
<hmir>	You god damn muricans!
<treefiddy_>	it's historically correct
<treefiddy_>	you just dont know how to snl
<hmir>	Not in 2015 it aint!
<treefiddy_>	good thing the skit is from the 70's
<pingfloyd>	czech people I've known don't seem to care if say czechloslovakian
<treefiddy_>	!
<hmir>	The czech guy I called sloviakian once got mad at me! He goes "Fuck the slovaks"!
<idioterna>	some people take nations and countries way too seriously
<pingfloyd>	he's probably just a nationalistic idiot
<Estr>	People from those countries are quite weird people
<idioterna>	Estr: IM NOT WEIRD!!! RETRACT WHAT YOU SAID OR
<idioterna>	well, nothing.
<hmir>	=p
<hmir>	=o
<Estr>	You even admitted that your country were weird LOL
<Estr>	Like a week ago
<idioterna>	is there a country that isn't weird?
<Estr>	or less
<Estr>	North korea
<idioterna>	oh
<idioterna>	right
<idioterna>	best korea is indeed not weird
<idioterna>	it's totally normal
<pingfloyd>	NK is the weirdest of them all
<Estr>	Indeed
<idioterna>	well pot is legal there
<hmir>	Nop!
<idioterna>	what do you mean nop
<hmir>	I mean nop!
<idioterna>	it says so on wikipedia or somewhere
<pingfloyd>	no pot isn't legal there, but consumption of lawn grass is encouraged
<pingfloyd>	not the same grass
<idioterna>	yes it's legal
<Estr>	No, it's not legal
<Estr>	M8
<pingfloyd>	hell, they would probably execute you for smoking weed there
<Estr>	I've watched like 9 trillion different documentaries of north korea
<pingfloyd>	dictators don't like weed, it gets people to think outside the box they put them in
<idioterna>	 North Korea Legal Legal Legal Legal Although several drugs are illegal in North Korea, Cannabis is not one of them.[95]
<idioterna>	it's all green
<pingfloyd>	why do you think Nixon changed it's classification?
<idioterna>	apparently it's legal
<idioterna>	and i know why that could be
<idioterna>	their juche ideology means they need to be self-reliant
<ilovelinux>	http://www.twitch.tv/ilovelinux
<idioterna>	and pot basically grows anywhere by itself
<idioterna>	so it's a good choice for them
<pingfloyd>	well I'll be
<pingfloyd>	that's pretty shocking
<idioterna>	what?
<idioterna>	the legality of pot in north korea?
<idioterna>	i still can't quite grasp why the hell wouldn't it be legal anywhere in the world
<idioterna>	it's like outlawing nutmeg
<idioterna>	and i'm sure some countries might
<pingfloyd>	being NK though, you can never tell what is a front
<idioterna>	yeah, that's true
<Estr>	We got alcohol
<Estr>	we dont need no pot
<idioterna>	i heard they had another purge
<idioterna>	alcohol sucks
<pingfloyd>	they may want the world to think they're tolerant, but in practice behind their curtain...
<Estr>	why?
<idioterna>	it's only good for cleaning cassette deck heads
<Estr>	I'm like the youngest alcoholic ever
<pingfloyd>	hope they really are though, their citizens have enough of a raw deal
<idioterna>	i've never ingested alcohol in my life
<Estr>	Ok, maybe not, considering some countries allow you to drink when you're 16
<Estr>	Then how can you say alcohol sucks?
<idioterna>	because so many people around me drink so much of it
<idioterna>	and i can see how they become idiots
<Estr>	Yes, because they love it
<Estr>	Being an idiot is the fun part
<pingfloyd>	idioterna: yeah, I've never met a bright drunk
<idioterna>	Estr: but lots of people around me smoke pot as well
<idioterna>	i don't
<idioterna>	but they do
<idioterna>	and the people who drink annoy me
<idioterna>	and the people who smoke do not
<pingfloyd>	they might be smart underneath all the booze, but it never comes out because they're drunks
<Estr>	That could be a coincidence though
<idioterna>	drunks always try to get me to drink, all the way up to violence
<pingfloyd>	nothing but stupidity comes to the surface
<idioterna>	pot guys just ask pass the joint and i pass it on
<idioterna>	and nobody gives a shit
<pingfloyd>	exactly,
<pingfloyd>	Me and everyone I know, will pass it to you to share, but nobody cares if you pass on it
*	Cell_vs_Gohan is now known as hassoon
<pingfloyd>	all you have to do to fit in with a pot head is just not look down on them smoking it.
<idioterna>	but if you refuse alcohol they start calling on you to drink
<idioterna>	and you have to
<idioterna>	and i don't
<pingfloyd>	that always seems to be the nature with alcohol
<pingfloyd>	it makes people belligerent
<y0wza>	ah thers a time n place
<honey>	well call me belligerent.
<honey>	lol
<pingfloyd>	I think probably weed is what made so uninterested in drinking.  I'd rather have the company of stoners than drunks.
<idioterna>	it's just rude
<pingfloyd>	any day
<idioterna>	i'm quite out of my mind being sober so
<idioterna>	i don't really need drugs to have weird ideas
<pingfloyd>	even rather have the company of someone frying unless they're going crazy or something
<binaryhermit>	not everybody's a belligerent when drunk
<honey>	when i'm drunk. i call it like i see it.
<pingfloyd>	well, not everyone that drinks is a drunk
<idioterna>	no, but in our society drinking is generally associated with having a good time
<idioterna>	and everyone thinks those that don't drink are having a crappy time
<honey>	i dont think that.
<honey>	to each their own.
<idioterna>	i call it like i see it when i'm sober, too
<honey>	i cant handle drug addicts.
<idioterna>	really?
<idioterna>	how can you tell when someone's an addict?
<honey>	you have to be there first hand.
<honey>	i'm not talking online.
<sunstar>	its usually glaringly obvious
<pingfloyd>	the way I tell is when they start scamming their friends and family
<pingfloyd>	scamming or stealing from them etc.
<honey>	ive seen good families ripped apart.
<idioterna>	oh
<idioterna>	yeah, that'd definitely count
<idioterna>	well in my country about 15% of the population starts drinking in the morning
<honey>	oh?
<honey>	what country if you dont mind me asking?
<pingfloyd>	also, addicts are extremely self absorbed and you can see in all their motives
<idioterna>	slovenia
<honey>	i cant drink during the day.
<idioterna>	they can't, either
<idioterna>	but they have to, or they have tremors
<idioterna>	and it's fairly normal for teenagers to not remember weekends
<idioterna>	due to the amount of alcohol they consume
<Eliz>	anybody else get spammed by Gjeku every time they enter this channel? :/
<pingfloyd>	they're definitely addicts if they're getting DTs
<pingfloyd>	I had an ex once, that would get DTs if she went a day without drinking.  She was an expert maintenance alcoholic.
<diogenese>	Before I quit drinking I was consuming close to 2 gallons of whiskey a week. I know what DTs are.
<idioterna>	my dad bought a spot of land, built a wooden house, retired and now drinks unhealthy amounts of beer
<pingfloyd>	she basically was never fully sober, but was drunk only after work/business.
<sunstar>	a "functioning alcoholic"
<pingfloyd>	I don't think she ever really liked that I smoked weed
<idioterna>	i also have friends who drink just to get dizzy
<idioterna>	and plug out
<idioterna>	but it's easy to do that without consuming dangerous chemicals
<CHVNX>	I'm drinking so that I don't have to murder all of you. Does that count as "functioning"?
<idioterna>	such as alcohol
<idioterna>	CHVNX: you could just take some aspirin instead
<CHVNX>	Why would I take a non-psychoactive blood thinner for a lingering hatred of humanity? Beer works better.
<CHVNX>	Learn to doctor.
<coldsparrow>	lol

<CHVNX>	Need that advance before I hit pen to paper, though.
<CHVNX>	Bills to pay.
<szt>	penguin1263: if it's local, why not?
<szt>	if you really can't get it patched
<penguin1263>	yeah
<penguin1263>	wht?
<penguin1263>	what*
<szt>	patching = using a cable
<FreezingCold>	pingfloyd: true, if I cared about the privacy I would probably just ask him to forward it.
<penguin1263>	euuughhh
<FreezingCold>	But I hate the idea of being tied to a physical location.
<penguin1263>	its a usb wifi thing
<penguin1263>	:/
<penguin1263>	its an old repurposed crapooter
<pingfloyd>	I don't put any personal details in the trust of strangers
<szt>	it would definetly lower the bandwidth
<penguin1263>	its an old repurposed crapooter
<szt>	if you wanna stream media with it, you probably shouldn't do it
<CHVNX>	Wells Fargo Is Baltimore’s Real Looter - Blacks were more likely than whites to be sold a predatory "ghetto" loan. Why doesn't the media expose this injustice?
<pingfloyd>	you want some stranger to know where you bank, who you do business with, your financial affairs, etc?
<hassoon>	CHVNX: you're a hardcore mercieless careless woman.
<pingfloyd>	who you owe, and so on
<hassoon>	^ fact of the day

<geektech713>	I am such a naughty boy
<FreezingCold>	CHVNX: why do you have a vagina?
<CHVNX>	hassoon: Is that why you creep my photoshoots?
<hassoon>	FreezingCold: rofl
<FreezingCold>	hassoon: I don't get why a man would have a vagina.
<FreezingCold>	srsly
<hassoon>	FreezingCold: LMFAO pal...

<hassoon>	FreezingCold: don't worry, she deosn't fit in a pornographic context
<FreezingCold>	ah, fat?
<hassoon>	nah, just something else, lulz
<jenni>	Do you have any nicknames
<CHVNX>	I was challenged to style a pair of havaianas and hoola shades I picked. Decided to go for a relaxed look by pairing my @mdscollections floral jumpsuit with the havaianas and shades. The new series of sandals can be easily matched without looking too casual! I also love how the colour of shades complemented my blue jumpsuit! This outfit is surely fuss free and comfortable! Let me know what you think?
<hassoon>	she is likes eating food from all-over the world though
<FreezingCold>	jenni: Hmm?
<hassoon>	*she likes *
<CHVNX>	is likes

<CHVNX>	Bruce Jenni
<FreezingCold>	jenni: If CHVNX is fat or not :(
<CHVNX>	FreezingCold: I am a model.
<hassoon>	FreezingCold: nah, a very-short person
<FreezingCold>	CHVNX: "model" as in....?
<jenni>	no, we were talking about artificial intelligence in general, not just you.
<hassoon>	FreezingCold: i might appear a giant in front of her, I am 2-meters tall
<FreezingCold>	hassoon: under 5' tall feels weird.

<hassoon>	FreezingCold: lulz she is soooo short
<CHVNX>	https://instagram.com/chvnx
<hassoon>	thereyou go

<hassoon>	CHVNX: nah, it's not about that, i told you already, you're sexually a fail, with no offence
<Skizzerz>	that triangle is depressingly true :(
<CHVNX>	hassoon: That's not an answer to my question. How can you not an hero when you're still a virgin at your age?
<hassoon>	you remind me of a french teacher of the primary-school era haha
<FreezingCold>	CHVNX: definitely cray-cray
<CHVNX>	C'est tres bon.
<hassoon>	CHVNX: is being virgin a sin?

<FreezingCold>	CHVNX: the one I'm thinking of was really sexist. though I don't think it is hassoon
<FreezingCold>	I didn't say it was because he was muslim, he did :p
<CHVNX>	forks: peter jusqu'à ce que ses explose ass

<CHVNX>	asdfhhki_: I feel like I should know the origin of that quote.  Sum 41, perhaps?
<Audioburn>	the whole conversation yall had was weird
<Audioburn>	if ya ask me
<hassoon>	FreezingCold: the far-eastern side of the world seems interesting imo

<Audioburn>	idioterna, so among the 3 types, the long-term, the project-based, and the periodic consulting contracts, was there any sort of connection or correlation between these three types and the type of entity you acted as (freelancer, consultant, agency, contractor)? Or did it always depend on the client (where even if a client wanted periodic consulting, you might still act as a freelancer or agency)? And the Statement of Work, is this also
<Audioburn>	 a Slovenian (or EU) legal term?

<treefiddy_>	merryweather
<JessicaJ>	fo realz dawg
<treefiddy_>	by unanimous decision
<treefiddy_>	everyone feels dumb for paying for pay per view now
<flipapy>	hm, ...
<treefiddy_>	buyers remorse haha
<JessicaJ>	doubt they feel dumb.. they got what they paid for
<JessicaJ>	seeing it live
<treefiddy_>	ive seen a lot of complaints
<pingfloyd>	the irony was that movie was more in touch with karate history and philosophy than most movies.  Seems they did some research on Okinawan karate and philosophy around it.
<flipapy>	aw comeon, look s like it was really close
<flipapy>	what movie pingfloyd ?
<treefiddy_>	idk, boxing is kind of boring
<flipapy>	agreed
<treefiddy_>	it's no ufc
<pingfloyd>	flipapy: karate kid
<flipapy>	oh, the original pingfloyd ?
<pingfloyd>	flipapy: yeah
<JessicaJ>	treefiddy_, whiners cuz their man didnt win or the fight wasnt exciting enough.. they still got what they paid for
<treefiddy_>	and there's no rhonda rowsey doing a ninja flip over her opponent and making her tap out in 14 seconds
<pingfloyd>	it was pretty faithful to the type of training in Okinawa
<treefiddy_>	karate no here
<pingfloyd>	and the philosophy that as you become more of a perfect killing weapon the more you never want to use your karate in battle
<treefiddy_>	karate here
<treefiddy_>	whack on. whack off
<flipapy>	oh dear.
<Fowler>	Whack what onto what?
<treefiddy_>	danielson. show me
<Fowler>	Whack a mallet onto a mole?
<treefiddy_>	paint the face
<Bouncer>	LOL
<Bouncer>	fence
<Bouncer>	paint the fe.. oh. you actually MEANT face.
<Bouncer>	Uhh.. yeah.
<JessicaJ>	laterz ppl persons
<treefiddy_>	i meant fence
*	Bouncer steps away
<treefiddy_>	but i typed face
<treefiddy_>	haha
<treefiddy_>	later nerd
<JessicaJ>	tc treefiddy_ here but not here if ya know what i mean ;)
<pingfloyd>	flipapy: really the first 3
<pingfloyd>	flipapy: because later he had him focus on kata
<Flerb>	seriously rent control is a shitty idea
<treefiddy_>	you know what a really good movie about martial arts was?
<Flerb>	it ruins citie
<Flerb>	s
<treefiddy_>	one of the best and most underrated really
<penguin1263>	cydia city
<treefiddy_>	but it was a little known movie called Gymkata
<penguin1263>	the most moth infested city
<pingfloyd>	I remember gymkata
<treefiddy_>	i mean a movie about the fusion of gymnastics and karate
<treefiddy_>	why did this not become a thing?
<pingfloyd>	I think because of the execution
<treefiddy_>	and they already had ninjas
<treefiddy_>	which were cooler
<pingfloyd>	the concept was good, but the movie could have executed the concept better
<treefiddy_>	and basically the same thing
<pingfloyd>	it focused too much on cinematics in place of skill
<pingfloyd>	they all do it to an extent
<treefiddy_>	Johnathan Cabot is a champion gymnast. In the tiny, yet savage, country of Parmistan, there is a perfect spot for a "star wars" site. For the US to get this site, they must compete in the brutal "Game". The government calls on Cabot, the son of a former operative, to win the game. Cabot must combine his gymnastics skills of the west with fighting secrets of the east and form GYMKATA!
<treefiddy_>	parmistan haha
<checkmatein1>	bye
<penguin1263>	can you guys google why AT&T is out in columbus, ohio
<treefiddy_>	haha it was nominated for a razzie, worst actor ever award haha
<Bouncer>	Parmistan?
<pingfloyd>	it's a tough one, are your stars more martial artists or more of actors?
<Bouncer>	Is that where they make Parmistan chese?
<treefiddy_>	gymnasts!
<treefiddy_>	Bouncer: i think so
<pingfloyd>	usually you make some compromises, like the main characters being actors and you train them a little.  Everyone one else martial artists.
<pingfloyd>	treefiddy_: chopsocky movies in general
<pingfloyd>	that's always been the dilemma for casting them
<treefiddy_>	yesh
<pingfloyd>	the shaw brothers put more priority on using real martial artists
<pingfloyd>	I think they sort of got looser with that as time went on though
<pingfloyd>	especially as the west started to take an interest in these types of films
<treefiddy_>	make you feel real loose like a long neck goose
<ssquirrel>	HAMBONE
<ssquirrel>	hhahah
<Bouncer>	bbl!

<treefiddy_>	nobody worth being with likes body hair
<introvert->	chesthair seems uncomfortable.
<redcheckers>	introvert-: not as uncomfortable as breasts would be.
<introvert->	they're actually not that uncomfortable.
<introvert->	if you're ever in a car, and don't have a pillow.
<introvert->	you get to put your chin on your boobs.
<redcheckers>	my chin is too small for that :(
<penguin1263>	but something for boobs
<treefiddy_>	introvert-: half the guys in here can do that too
<penguin1263>	unexpected stair climbing boob pain maybe?

<introvert->	theres not enough room in here for both of us to have red. you better stick with black.
<introvert->	woah, woah.
<uxfi>	hi
<redcheckers>	hi fi
<uxfi>	redcheckers This is how I know ^Phantom^  still likes you. You ready?
<penguin1263>	why is bazhang voiced?
<uxfi>	or penguin1263 ...
<penguin1263>	well bye i gtg :/
<penguin1263>	because its 10:30 PM and theres nothing to do
<introvert->	oh,
<penguin1263>	and my bouncer is completely fucked because AT&T cut the cables everywhere
<redcheckers>	penguin1263: they didnt cut them here
<penguin1263>	in ohio somewhere
<introvert->	why did they do that.
<redcheckers>	we still have the new dod fiber line alongside the new at&t fiber line almost all along the 71st and 61st street access route
<redcheckers>	^_^
<penguin1263>	idk
<redcheckers>	it doesnt show up on google maps for some reason they didnt add the utility layers yet
<penguin1263>	maybe they decided to "connect" someone to it
<uxfi>	uxfi When penguin1263  showed up last year, head over heels for you, Sarah McLachlan was all she listened to. If "Fumbling Towards Ecstasy" wasn't in the CD player, it was only so "Solace" could get a little airplay. I started calling it 'Ben music'... not to her face but behind her back. But then it went away, and I thought Sarah was gone for good. I almost started celebrating.
<redcheckers>	15 minutes 26 seconds
<redcheckers>	uxfi: rather play building a mystery
<uxfi>	And then you showed up again. You offered penguin1263   this cross-country trip of a lifetime, which means I got to memorize every lyric from "Surfacing"... all 10 songs! This year started off McLachlan-heavy, until the big break-up, and then all of Felicity's hair went away, and so did Sarah. Until you guys broke into the pool. Now maybe it was a coincidence, but guess who started to make a comeback?
<uxfi>	 It was gradual, but constant, and now if you want me to, I can sing any song from "Mirrorball" which really annoys the hell out of me! So if you're ever curious about whether Felicity has the hots for you, just check her boom box.
<redcheckers>	uxfi: play building a mystery
<uxfi>	I will :P
<redcheckers>	not will, do it now
<introvert->	i'm not even gunna read that.
<redcheckers>	introvert-: with microsoft's text to speech engine, you don't have to
<introvert->	you just read it for me.
<redcheckers>	no i didnt
<introvert->	NOW.
<redcheckers>	i had my response already in mind because this same conversation took place in a dream i had when i was 12
<redcheckers>	^_^
<sabotender>	moo 🐮
<sabotender>	yay, everything is all clean
<jelly>	redcheckers: now I got an earworm, why did you have to type that song title
<introvert->	well then.
<penguin1263>	why do so many people use ssh as a bouncer
<mattfury>	SO APPARENTLY ACCORDING  TO MONOPOLY WE CAN KEEP RUNNING
<penguin1263>	irssi --> ssh --> the uterus of your penis.
<introvert->	i thought you were leaving.
<uxfi>	brb
<penguin1263>	oh well

<redcheckers>	<--- actually has important papers
<introvert->	dont they have that bill me later on paypal

<Equinoxdawg>	I fucking hate people that do that, especially when they add only like a dollar or something
<redcheckers>	introvert-: thats okay though, i wasnt really happy getting it at that price
<redcheckers>	Equinoxdawg: i always wonder if those last minute bids come from the seller / their roomate etc
<redcheckers>	but i'm happy in this instance to not have ended up paying 30 bucks in shipping
<tacoshellmcgee>	Well I think people make $ from selling a bunch of crap they get from China
<tacoshellmcgee>	Like they'll buy a mouse from China for $2, sell it for $5
<introvert->	now i want to buy something.
<redcheckers>	yeah. one time a guy tried to sell me a nice suitcase on craigslist, we set a deal, then he flaked out and tried reselling it on cl for 600, then 900
<introvert->	like a sweater for my cat.
<tacoshellmcgee>	China takes a couple weeks to get here tho.
<redcheckers>	introvert-: you can just knit a sweater for your cat.

<tacoshellmcgee>	Red, one time I sold a macbook pro on Ebay… And then finally after 8 days someone reached out to me on Craigslist and offered me $150 more
<tacoshellmcgee>	I felt dumb
<tacoshellmcgee>	But you can't predict that kind of stuff :(
<redcheckers>	tacoshellmcgee:  i'm glad that i dont end up having to pay 30 bucks in shipping at least
<introvert->	can you buy cats on ebay
<redcheckers>	introvert-: not live ones... but if they are quantumn superpositional then yes

<redcheckers>	well, i dont like peppermint with black tea... do you have any coriander in your garden?
<sabotender>	too early for coriander, but that does not go in tea. its too sharp
<redcheckers>	no, the lemon grass covers most of it
<sabotender>	I mean, if you want your tea tasting like pico de gallo, that's your business.
<redcheckers>	x.x okay then mr peppermint

<sabotender>	im not growing anymore lemongrass. The last one I planted turned into a gigantic shrub

*	eir removes ban on *!*@capo.themafia.info
*	eir removes channel operator status from eir
<Equinoxdawg>	I wonder why he was banned
<tacoshellmcgee>	I've been hired by companies before based just off of my portfolio and attitude alone. And we're talking $100k salaries and shit
<SparkyFlary>	I read it word for word, I was like real prepared for momentary moment
<jenni>	how do you do?
<tacoshellmcgee>	I'm not sure that they wanted a verbatim answer from their company website
<SparkyFlary>	I have no idea
<tacoshellmcgee>	But … just as long as you didn't lie
<princefakhan>	SparkyFlary: good luck tho.
<SparkyFlary>	tnx
<princefakhan>	:)
<tacoshellmcgee>	Sparky, if you get hired I want a 10% fee for every bonus I help you attain
<princefakhan>	jenni: great. and u?
<jenni>	OK
<SparkyFlary>	Actually I felt like the guy liked compliments hope that gave me some edge
<tacoshellmcgee>	Did you close the interview room door and give him… <3 ?
<tacoshellmcgee>	Cause that would have done it!
<SparkyFlary>	hah too late interview by phone happened already
<tacoshellmcgee>	You shoulda been like " I LOVE YOU.. AND I LOVE YOUR WORK. I'm a FAN!!!"
<pingfloyd>	SparkyFlary: they should be telling you what kind of background checks they are going to do
<SparkyFlary>	yea threw some optimism but he kept talking for a min after each question on how valueable the company is and stuff
<pingfloyd>	SparkyFlary: and also be getting your consent to do them
<tacoshellmcgee>	Actually, the fact that you are on fire to work for the company is a big plus
<pingfloyd>	they should also be able to answer what they are going to do with the information if you ask them
<tacoshellmcgee>	They want people who are excited to work for the company
<tacoshellmcgee>	Because they'll get more slavery out of you
<tacoshellmcgee>	LOL jk
<tacoshellmcgee>	Not trying to scare u :)
<tacoshellmcgee>	Sparky, they won't do a background check usually unless it's your first day on the job as an employee.
<SparkyFlary>	I was most concern why they might want a young guy like me but I read they need my consent now if they want to take out a life insurance behind my baxk
<SparkyFlary>	back
<tacoshellmcgee>	What??
<tacoshellmcgee>	Consent for what??
<tacoshellmcgee>	All I know is, I don't give my SSN to anyone unless the offer letter has already been sent and it's my first day on the job
<tacoshellmcgee>	That's how I work
<SparkyFlary>	back before 2006 companies liked to hire young people and give as little security to them as possible
<tacoshellmcgee>	Um, yeah that's how it works
<tacoshellmcgee>	I'd do the same thing if I was hiring people
<tacoshellmcgee>	Ask not what I can do for you, ask what you can do for me, repeatedly, until you are stressed out, THEN take your vacation :P
<hmir>	Smoochie time!
<tacoshellmcgee>	hmir, tushy suqeeze
<y0wza>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSK1-G5bbfY
<SparkyFlary>	yea they would make a lot of money if you died even after being gone from working therr
*	hmir licks tacoshellmcgee
<SparkyFlary>	but its no longer 2006 so yay
<tacoshellmcgee>	Sparky, just keep applying to new places
<tacoshellmcgee>	Like last job I had I told them straight out
<tacoshellmcgee>	I've had offers
<pingfloyd>	if they get consent, it isn't behind your back
<tacoshellmcgee>	I told them my highest offer and the CEO countered with $10k above it
<Bouncer>	What kinda offers?
<pingfloyd>	it's the opposite of behind your back (above board)
<tacoshellmcgee>	Go in there like you're king shit
<SparkyFlary>	yea I wont give them consent
<treefiddy_>	sekrit offers!
<tacoshellmcgee>	Look, this is how you get hired
<Bouncer>	Oh, I thought you meant like free all-you-can-eat-waffles.
<tacoshellmcgee>	Go in there like you're king shit, then underperform and get fired within 3 months
<tacoshellmcgee>	That's how i like to do things
<pingfloyd>	you got to go in the as a business man
<pingfloyd>	you're there to conduct business
<tacoshellmcgee>	ping, I honestly do
<pingfloyd>	need to be in that mindset at the interview
<tacoshellmcgee>	I go in there with a gun on my hip
<tacoshellmcgee>	Just in case it turns into mob war
<tacoshellmcgee>	That's how business focused I am
<treefiddy_>	take your pants off, relax
<jenni>	yes, you!
<SparkyFlary>	I read bank people uswd yo pay hitmen 50k to knock out the young executives and make 300k from them due to grabbing a life insurance on them
<Bouncer>	I think just about every job I ever got was based on who I knew.
<SparkyFlary>	used to
<tacoshellmcgee>	Sparky, haha
<tacoshellmcgee>	LOOOOOl
<tacoshellmcgee>	Sparky they're going to KILL YOU!
<tacoshellmcgee>	LOOOOOOL
<Bouncer>	b-b-but I'm wearing my stretch fatboy pants!
<SparkyFlary>	thats life for you
<Bouncer>	And they are the comfeh!
<pingfloyd>	SparkyFlary: it's a trap!!!
<SparkyFlary>	nah thats not legal anymore
<tacoshellmcgee>	OMg
<pingfloyd>	they're going to plug you into the matrix and steal your brainwaves
<tacoshellmcgee>	That's funny
<SparkyFlary>	used to be, not no kore
<SparkyFlary>	more
<pingfloyd>	I don't think it ever was legal
<tacoshellmcgee>	Hire someone, kill them by spending $50k and then collect $250k profit.
<tacoshellmcgee>	Talk about lawl
<pingfloyd>	legal to the mafia maybe
<tacoshellmcgee>	That's nuts man. lol
<pingfloyd>	SparkyFlary: just don't piss off a made man
<pingfloyd>	you'll do fine
<tacoshellmcgee>	Sparky, just piss ON him
<SparkyFlary>	haha yea, walmarrt,nestle,banks, at&t prob did this
<SparkyFlary>	used to
<pingfloyd>	fuggedaboutit
<pingfloyd>	yous seem like a rat maybe
<pingfloyd>	why you ask so many questions anyway?
<tacoshellmcgee>	hah
<pingfloyd>	you think I'm funny?
<tacoshellmcgee>	You're a clown to me
<pingfloyd>	do I amuse you?
<tacoshellmcgee>	You remind me of the circus and monkeys @ the zoo
<y0wza>	ooohoo
<y0wza>	i bet i know what they smell like 2
<tacoshellmcgee>	You guys should be killer whale trainers @ Sea World
<tacoshellmcgee>	This IT stuff is silly
<pingfloyd>	it's all fun and games until you're running Vista
<pingfloyd>	and Vista includes 8 btw
<SparkyFlary>	is it true theyre only hiring Indians in some companies here in the states?
<tacoshellmcgee>	lol
<DoverMo>	SparkyFlary, for tax purposes
<DoverMo>	and cost
<pingfloyd>	honest injun they're not, just ask Injun Joe
<SparkyFlary>	my auntie told me IR had nothing but Indians and she was only hired bc of her darker complexion
<princefakhan>	whhaaat!
<DoverMo>	no noe likes sales tax anymore cuz the money just gets wasted and handed out
<pingfloyd>	is your auntie a kkk member?
<SparkyFlary>	no
<tacoshellmcgee>	I wonder if extortion still happens
<tacoshellmcgee>	lol
<pingfloyd>	if that's the case, you might take her with a grain of salt
<pingfloyd>	of course it does
<tacoshellmcgee>	I can't believe extortion still happens like no big woop
<tacoshellmcgee>	Shits nutty
<SparkyFlary>	nah I hear companies prefer homogenous teams
<tacoshellmcgee>	Sparky, I just farted because of what you just said
<tacoshellmcgee>	I hope you're happy
<SparkyFlary>	lol
<pingfloyd>	was it a curry fart?
<pingfloyd>	those are the like WMDs of farts
<SparkyFlary>	next time Im a put down Im Hindu when I apply
<pingfloyd>	assuming they're not sharts
<pingfloyd>	tell them you're albino Hindu
<SparkyFlary>	Ill be the only white guy there if I make it into an interview
<tacoshellmcgee>	Nah I only ate some salad last night and pasta tonight
<tacoshellmcgee>	 so I think we're good
<pingfloyd>	they can't do anything about it
<pingfloyd>	the information is voluntary and "will have no determination on your employment"
<pingfloyd>	they say
<SparkyFlary>	I call bs it there for reasons no ordinary person alone can comprehend
<tacoshellmcgee>	I WILL STAB!
<pingfloyd>	it's for reporting to the federal government
<tacoshellmcgee>	Don't make me STAB!
<pingfloyd>	they have to submit diversity reports
<pingfloyd>	with figures
<redcheckers>	hmmn
<pingfloyd>	it's like having the burden of proof put on them to prove they're not bigots
<redcheckers>	i thought of a good team to run, but i dont have the right figures x.x
<pingfloyd>	they have to prove that to the federal government each year
<tacoshellmcgee>	red, what is this team you're building?
<tacoshellmcgee>	Is this ths 4th reich?
<SparkyFlary>	I dont believe in that, I seen this other place that hired only one female out of the dozens and dozens of guys just for the sake of having one female and diversity
<pingfloyd>	here's the thing though, try to get them to have you prove you're of certain ethnic origin.  That will go over well won't it.
<pingfloyd>	use their own system against them
<SparkyFlary>	Im African bc we all in a way descendant from there
<pingfloyd>	an employer asking the question at all is bullshit to begin with
<tacoshellmcgee>	Just get the job done son!
<pingfloyd>	it's contradictory on itself
<tacoshellmcgee>	It don't matter your color bro!
<SparkyFlary>	then why do they always ask
<tacoshellmcgee>	LOL
<tacoshellmcgee>	You don't have to answer that
<pingfloyd>	that's why they have to give you "decline to answer" as an answer option and spell out all the legalese.
<tacoshellmcgee>	If it bothers you that much don't asnwer it
<tacoshellmcgee>	put that you're white
<tacoshellmcgee>	they can suck it
<pingfloyd>	because it would be considered racist/sexist to ask those two questions without it being made very clear what your rights are.
<tacoshellmcgee>	There are so many IT jobs that
<tacoshellmcgee>	I wouldn't even worry about ti
<tacoshellmcgee>	Just know your stuff son!
<pingfloyd>	depends where you live
<SparkyFlary>	there arent many here
<hassoon>	lmfao  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHts7CoLnI4
<tacoshellmcgee>	Sparky, where do you live ?
<SparkyFlary>	ca
<pingfloyd>	but that's something you have to consider if you want to work in this industry
<tacoshellmcgee>	There's not many tech jobs in CA?
<tacoshellmcgee>	LOL
<tacoshellmcgee>	WTF?
<pingfloyd>	moving to a location with a lot of demand for it
<tacoshellmcgee>	L2 upward mobility. Sometimes you have to travel to land your dream job. But I live in Los Angeles and there's plenty of IT shit here
<pingfloyd>	depends which part of CA
<pingfloyd>	live near a major city
<SparkyFlary>	maybe uphill but Im closer to the beach
<hmir>	You'll end up dead in my shed.
<tacoshellmcgee>	lawl
<pingfloyd>	do you live out in the bf egypt or something
<SparkyFlary>	im from la too i see nothing
<tacoshellmcgee>	Sparky, there are TONS of coder jobs in Santa Monica and seriously all across Los Angeles mang
<tacoshellmcgee>	You see nothing? Are you on Monster? Are you on Linked In?
<tacoshellmcgee>	Use the tools that are out there mang.
<SparkyFlary>	I hate those tools
<pingfloyd>	the job is going to find you mang
<tacoshellmcgee>	Oh
<SparkyFlary>	they search for me?
<tacoshellmcgee>	Well then get left behind in the dust
<pingfloyd>	actually if you've been doing it awhile they will
<pingfloyd>	recruiters will
<pingfloyd>	you think this is the old days where you send snail mail and have a 1 in 1 chance of getting the job?
<SparkyFlary>	not quite finished learning coding
<pingfloyd>	there's a finished?
<tacoshellmcgee>	ROFL ROFL ROFL
<tacoshellmcgee>	i just can't believe you said you don't like those tools
<pingfloyd>	what's finished learning something?
<tacoshellmcgee>	ping, i k r
<pingfloyd>	one less competitor
<tacoshellmcgee>	LOL!
<SparkyFlary>	those sites harm more than help imo
<pingfloyd>	like it makes any difference though, because I have huge secrets to success
<tacoshellmcgee>	That way of thinking is harming your chances
<pingfloyd>	getting the job is like a big game itself
<SparkyFlary>	nah I tried a more local discrete approach and it worked
<pingfloyd>	you create domino effects
<tacoshellmcgee>	It doesn't work until you land the job buddy
<tacoshellmcgee>	hehe
<pingfloyd>	and then have a ton of voice mails
<tacoshellmcgee>	BRB ordering dominos because I want salad and pizza and tasty shit
<pingfloyd>	what's local got to do with it?
<pingfloyd>	that's where you look for the local ones unless you want to relocate
<tacoshellmcgee>	I know. Nowadays there are a lot of remote positions
<SparkyFlary>	I think stuff need to be destroyed again and remade, maybe some super virus to delete everything like the good ol days or something
<pingfloyd>	unless you live out in the boonies, there should be locals on listed
<pingfloyd>	*ones
<pingfloyd>	but if you live out in the boonies, you need to move closer to civilization for an IT job
<tacoshellmcgee>	oh shit
<tacoshellmcgee>	LOL
<tacoshellmcgee>	Let me guess
<tacoshellmcgee>	Version control is a bad idea
<tacoshellmcgee>	Object oriented development is also evil
<SparkyFlary>	prob not
<tacoshellmcgee>	parameterized queries are bad, amirite?
<pingfloyd>	you've been watching too much Fight Club
<tacoshellmcgee>	Let's take things back
<SparkyFlary>	dbz
<tacoshellmcgee>	To the good ol' days when there were 20 million people on the internet
<pingfloyd>	that only works if you're Tyler Durden
<pingfloyd>	I wouldn't base life off dbz
<tacoshellmcgee>	Sorry, that's reverse progression
<hmir>	Frozen my heart, frozen my soul.
<tacoshellmcgee>	And if you think in that box
<pingfloyd>	*life decisions
<SparkyFlary>	ah yes good times
<hmir>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCztXuXAPqM
<tacoshellmcgee>	Then the job you're going to find is where they do everything wrong
<tacoshellmcgee>	And are on the verge of extinction
<CosmicWitch>	what
<SparkyFlary>	I didnt say revert back, I meant destroy and force big men to rehire lil boys
<pingfloyd>	that's the problem, you think it should be handed over to you
<pingfloyd>	you've got to stake your claim
<SparkyFlary>	I think this is the job for big Russia
<pingfloyd>	people don't want to hire boys, they want to hire men
<tacoshellmcgee>	What does men vs. boys have to do with it
<pingfloyd>	ask SparkyFlary
<tacoshellmcgee>	It's best practices vs. old antiquated garbage
<pingfloyd>	He's trying to say everything should be destroyed and handed over to his generation
<tacoshellmcgee>	Yet he's mentioning the good ol' days?
<pingfloyd>	sounds more like entitlement
<DoverMo>	they want to hire mid life crisis's
<SparkyFlary>	heck yea we are entitled
<pingfloyd>	were those back in kindergarten?
<hmir>	When dfoes one usually have a mid life crisis?
<hmir>	What age?
<tacoshellmcgee>	Dover, they also want to hire postal on edge maniacs
<pingfloyd>	around 40
<tacoshellmcgee>	I sped my mid life crisis up to 34
<tacoshellmcgee>	I didn't want to wait for it
<pingfloyd>	it's not necessarily a mid life crisis as much as a realization how much of life is really just bullshit
<hmir>	Life isn't bullshit!
<SparkyFlary>	back then this kindergardener or 2nd grader or w.e threatened a teacher to cut off his car breaks during recess if he gave him detention
<tacoshellmcgee>	Life has a lot of bullshit
<hmir>	Anyone that thinks that probably just had a shitty life.
<tacoshellmcgee>	The ghetto days
<pingfloyd>	yeah, but then you quit caring that it is
<tacoshellmcgee>	ping, correct
<tacoshellmcgee>	You start realizing why life actually ends
<pingfloyd>	and decide you'll just do whatever you damn well please
<SparkyFlary>	people got what they wanted
<tacoshellmcgee>	And you thank God that it does
<hmir>	But I've already been doing that all my life! =\
<tacoshellmcgee>	ping, agreed
<spl1f>	mrrnen
<hmir>	I feel like i fundamentally missed out on the whole midlife crisi thing. =(
<pingfloyd>	really the only thing that isn't, is any freedom you have
<tacoshellmcgee>	There' a comfort in knowing life ends, and there's also a comfort in knowing that you have a limited amount of time, and shouldn't piss any of it away. Live YOUR LIFE
<tacoshellmcgee>	That's the growing up part of things, for me I guess
<spl1f>	late 30s i went through ruff patch
<pingfloyd>	and then you start watching others trying to impress others for kicks
<spl1f>	yeah it is
<pingfloyd>	for a good laugh
<tacoshellmcgee>	And then you're like "wow I remember when i was stupid too, god bless them"
<spl1f>	the awesome part is if ya get through it ya enjoy life diff way
<smgs>	hi
<tacoshellmcgee>	Yeah, you go to the beach when you want to
<smgs>	anyone good at excel ?
<tacoshellmcgee>	And let lifes stresses die
<spl1f>	highdy
<tacoshellmcgee>	And you stop being afraid of losing anything, because the only thing you can lose is your life
<spl1f>	horrible at excel  :-)
<tacoshellmcgee>	Who cares if you lose a job who cares if you lose a girlfriend. Life is the only thing that you can lose, everything else is simple
<smgs>	spl1f could you guide if there is any channel ?
<princefakhan>	The question is: how do you enjoy life. Money that is.
<tacoshellmcgee>	Yeah money
<tacoshellmcgee>	extort whenever you can

<ohsnap>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bnxp14wVycQ
<rosenberg>	what software do they use?
<jelly>	rajrajraj: the program is 4096 bytes.  It requires a hefty nvidia 8800GTS to work, and pushes lots of procedurally generated 3d into it.
<irreverant>	Good morning everyone!
<jelly>	and a third or so of those 4096B is music
<rosenberg>	hi irreverant
<rajrajraj>	jelly:  i see, but i need an audio file, not a program.
<Estr>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfANs2y_frk
<rajrajraj>	Estr:  wow
<jelly>	rajrajraj: the program is the audio data, and code to play it, and code to decompress both.
<rajrajraj>	jelly:  i know, but i need a plain audio file, anyways i appreciate what you shared.

<sud0>	they were all high as heck so it didnt matter
<princefakhan>	hehe
<NotSmirks>	i insulted obama saying he is in the toilet
<princefakhan>	aint got no problem if they are high but make logical benders
<sud0>	a dude said "wait, what gotta do with lightning?"
<NotSmirks>	person called it "an insult to humanity'
<sud0>	and their boss replied: "that... you are fired? got it? FIRED *giggle*"
<princefakhan>	NotSmirks: lol
<princefakhan>	haha. aint no logic son, we have an episode to do.
<sud0>	anyway I enjoyed Aang more than Korra
<princefakhan>	Aang and Korra, they are characters in avatar right.
<sud0>	somehow when theres a female main character every serie is full of romantic shit
<princefakhan>	I think theres a movie or something called legends of korra
<sud0>	yeah. Theres avatar: legend of aang, and Avatar: Legend of Korra
<princefakhan>	oh okay.
<princefakhan>	sud0: i guess the romantic stuff is bcoz they know 30+ watch this shit too
<NotSmirks>	am i the only one who thinks divergent is overrated
<princefakhan>	Notsmirks: yes it is.
<sud0>	u're not, NotSmirks
<princefakhan>	dunno about the book. but the movie is shit.
<NotSmirks>	the book itself was a typical dystopian romance
<princefakhan>	didn't watched the second one
<NotSmirks>	"didn't watched"
<NotSmirks>	gg no re
<princefakhan>	gg no re?

<NotSmirks>	"oh i didnt see that movie" - author
<princefakhan>	haha.
<NotSmirks>	princefakhan, from what the trailer shows, yes it must be.
<hmir>	Yuck!
<princefakhan>	:)
<NotSmirks>	my sister loved the Matched trilogy
<NotSmirks>	i really wanted to like it
*	hmir puts on Taken 3
<princefakhan>	all them competition movies are ripoffs of each other
<NotSmirks>	but it focused way too much on the love triangle
<princefakhan>	divergent series?
<NotSmirks>	no, the matched trilogy
<princefakhan>	oh.
<princefakhan>	love triangle is a necessity in these type of movies.
<princefakhan>	:P
<NotSmirks>	personally i dont like them
<princefakhan>	love triangles?
<NotSmirks>	yeah
<princefakhan>	you must watch the tv shows then.
<NotSmirks>	i don't watch tv at all
<princefakhan>	its like the show won't do without a current love triangle
<princefakhan>	Notsmirks: good. but there are good stuff to watch.
<NotSmirks>	ಠ_ಠ
<princefakhan>	in recent memory, daredevil. if u like comic stuff
<princefakhan>	and GoT. heh!
<NotSmirks>	do you find it awkward that we're the only ones talking?
<princefakhan>	ah yes. we were three. now we two are the only ones.
<princefakhan>	what I find awkward is though that there are 500+ people on this channel at a time.
<NotSmirks>	the majority of them are bots i think
<princefakhan>	and only 10 talk.
<princefakhan>	oh. why so many bots.
<princefakhan>	bots atleast do something.
<NotSmirks>	i don't know
<princefakhan>	these are human bots.
<NotSmirks>	most people come in and just sit there never talking
<princefakhan>	if ye get what I mean
<NotSmirks>	uh.. is balrog a bot?
<balrog>	NotSmirks: No

<NotSmirks>	that's scary though.
<NotSmirks>	imagine a bunch of people staring at you
<NotSmirks>	500+ people
<NotSmirks>	besides the room feels squished
<NotSmirks>	.-.
<Audioburn>	-.-
<NotSmirks>	oh
<NotSmirks>	ok
<dearhawk>	I just got here, don't know the context. All I saw was "imagine a bunch of people staring at you". I want to talk about that, NotSmirks.
<hassoon>	'sup
<dearhawk>	NotSmirks: so, lets imagine that. You're standing there (unspecified where, what etc). 'A bunch of people' are staring at you. There you stand.
<dearhawk>	NotSmirks: they are staring at you and you're just feeling weird.
<NotSmirks>	the "where" is here. and there's a bunch of people not talking.
<NotSmirks>	kinda scary if you think about it
<dearhawk>	NotSmirks: LOL! That makes it even more hilarious. Lets talk about that.
<dearhawk>	NotSmirks: even if we're talking about them, they're like zombies still. Makes it even more creepy.
<NotSmirks>	that dead stare
<dearhawk>	NotSmirks: yeah!
<dearhawk>	NotSmirks: as if they had no brain activity.
<NotSmirks>	they need irc brains
<dearhawk>	NotSmirks: it's like those autistic patients you can't communicate with. They're just there, doing whatever, no matter what you say or do to them.
<dearhawk>	530 of them in this room currently. Zombie apocalypse.
<NotSmirks>	oh yeah
<NotSmirks>	where's the armory?
<dearhawk>	I think you can barricade yourself with zombies. Just make a ring of them around you.
<dearhawk>	those zombies won't even do anything anyway.
<dearhawk>	except some retards. They either do zombie stuff, or go !ops trolling
<NotSmirks>	uh... thats a no-no word

<FauxReal>	To keep your registered nick, you must continue to use it. If you do not identify to your nick, it may eventually become expired. Once it becomes expired, someone can ask to have it dropped. When a nick has been dropped and picked up by another user, we are not able to take it back from them. That would be unfair to the user who picked it up. In other cases, someone could simply be using the nick while unidentified. You can force them to change their

<yano>	princefakhan: sort of

<redcheckers>	x.x
<yano>	you are free to exploit jenni, but it'd be preferred if you did that in #jenni-playground
<bazhang>	they were giving foul commands
<redcheckers>	yano that's just inviting evil :(
<yano>	redcheckers: i know
<Time-Warp>	LMAO REDCHECKERS
<Error418-Work>	treefiddy_: that's just it. Some say 1000, some say 1024. The old conversion problem again.
<sud0>	JENNI!

<KindOne>	simpler for me to watch that specific channel than watch all the channels she is in
<treefiddy_>	Error418-Work: the actual number is 1024. if they say different, it's a marketing thing. just trust your disk tools

<bazhang>	in the next 60 seconds or so yano
*	redcheckers always passes standardized tests anyways so he didnt listen to it
<Error418-Work>	AnTi_MTtr: I have no problem on standardized testing, just that it should be wrapped into regular tests, not interrupting regular instruction.
<AnTi_MTtr>	Error418-Work: thats definately one issue with it
<AnTi_MTtr>	theres actualy a few more important ones john goes over
<AnTi_MTtr>	like the intentionaly deceptive practices of the companies that create the tests
<AnTi_MTtr>	and the standards for grading
<treefiddy_>	yea
<Error418-Work>	of course, they could eliminate 90% of it anyway. There's only one part of it they need to test to standardize - and that's comprehension. You have that down, you can do anything.
<redcheckers>	intentionally deceptive, with two ll's ? how scary
<AnTi_MTtr>	some graders were actualy told "we are seeing to many 2 scores on these essays, you need to see more of the essays as 3s"
<AnTi_MTtr>	also the graders were talking about how they spend maybe 3-10 seconds grading a 2 paragraph essay
<AnTi_MTtr>	what a joke
<redcheckers>	AnTi_MTtr: i'm sure its a good way to prepare essay writers for their college application essays
<AnTi_MTtr>	you are sure?

<redcheckers>	what makes me sure is i did several essays when applying to schools, and a few when applying for certain jobs
<AnTi_MTtr>	and taking standardized tests made them better?
<redcheckers>	AnTi_MTtr: and the assessment of the essays varies widely among different raters
<AnTi_MTtr>	redcheckers: well thats a problem right there
<redcheckers>	AnTi_MTtr: because they don't have the time to go over each essay in depth
<yano>	bazhang: hm?
<AnTi_MTtr>	so its not about the quality of the essay? but the random lottery of who grades it?
<redcheckers>	AnTi_MTtr: people should get used to that sort of review of their essays early on.
<AnTi_MTtr>	you dont see a problem with this?
<redcheckers>	AnTi_MTtr: preparing people to function in a potentially broken system, has been a tried and true part of education

<AnTi_MTtr>	[12:09] <redcheckers> AnTi_MTtr: because they don't have the time to go over each essay in depth <<=-- why does pearson then put these essays on the test if they have no reasonable expectation of properly analyzing them?

<AnTi_MTtr>	that is part of the deceptive practices by these companies
<yano>	bazhang: actually, hold off on unquieting jenni

<AnTi_MTtr>	take the pineapple example from oliver's story
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<redcheckers>	AnTi_MTtr: just because you study and work hard is no guarantee of success
<AnTi_MTtr>	redcheckers: and what if they have good managers in the workforce? what does it prepare them for then?
<redcheckers>	AnTi_MTtr: no... but the good managers could let them know what its expected
<AnTi_MTtr>	redcheckers: it is if you are grading on the work you submit and not an arbitrary poorly written standardized exam questions
<redcheckers>	AnTi_MTtr: well, what would you like to replace the exam with, specifically
<redcheckers>	just no tests at all, ?
<AnTi_MTtr>	umm replace it with more class time
<AnTi_MTtr>	howabout that
<treefiddy_>	saliva tests
<treefiddy_>	if you drool a lot you might not be smrt

<sunstar>	wtf
<checkmatein1>	when h5 comes out I'm going to put a sledgehammer through my halo reach disc
<sunstar>	WHY
<checkmatein1>	reach is so laggy and I swear if it was actually good connection I would never lose a game
<sunstar>	WTF YOU BANNING PPL FOR NOW?!
<gamma>	sunstar: Don't type in all caps.
<pingfloyd>	sure blame the connection
<checkmatein1>	but because its laggy I shoot someone and then they die 2 seconds later and kill me even though if there was no lag I would have got the kill
<pingfloyd>	blame your 1Mbps+ connection
<checkmatein1>	every game has such high latency its annoying
<pingfloyd>	people don't know lag if the didn't play quake on dialup
<checkmatein1>	unless I'm connection host which happens 1 in 100 games
*	sunstar played q2 and q3 on 33.6k dialup
<checkmatein1>	H5 will have dedicated servers so no more horrible connection
<checkmatein1>	and no more american connection hosts (which is bad for me as I'm in the UK)
*	Guest41796 is now known as SPF|Cloud
<PerfM>	hi
<sunstar>	lag like that forces you to predict your oppenents moves long b4 they make them
<PerfM>	omg yaaas
<PerfM>	I was like muted for years
<pingfloyd>	seems like most console game have terrible net code
<PerfM>	omg pingfloyd, I even missed you
<pingfloyd>	*games
<checkmatein1>	pingfloyd: they really do and it annoyes me
<pingfloyd>	I really can't stand online gaming on console in general though
<pingfloyd>	aside from the lag, there's its community
<treefiddy_>	i like it
<checkmatein1>	I get screwed over by lag so much. my stats would be 10x better if I didnt get lag
<irreverant>	well whatever the reason no matter how much someone makes you mad; those things can affec tthat person and
<irreverant>	it shouldn't be done;
<treefiddy_>	i play in coop mode though
<irreverant>	yes women have hurt me and i've hurt women but the pain goes away and move on.
<sunstar>	i dont play games online on because i have an xbox 360
<treefiddy_>	i have an xbox 360 and i do play games online haha
<sunstar>	you dumb.
<treefiddy_>	nah
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<treefiddy_>	gta5 online!
<treefiddy_>	diablo3
<checkmatein1>	beaner connection as well. people using KFC wifi to play halo
<checkmatein1>	these people annoy me so much. and also reach is just a buggy game that doesnt work properly.
<pingfloyd>	irreverant: what are you talking about?
*	Time-Warp ninja crawls twords treefiddy_'s xbox 360
<checkmatein1>	e.g. when you shoot someone, sometimes they will die but sometimes they wont
<checkmatein1>	I dont really get it
<pingfloyd>	yeah, you probably get a lot of ghosting
<treefiddy_>	yeah if the server can't register the hits
<pingfloyd>	from misprediction
<treefiddy_>	they live
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<Time-Warp>	ghost pwnage
<checkmatein1>	when the connection is bad you legit have to shoot someone 3 times in the head before the shot registers
<pingfloyd>	in most netcode, the game will fill in the gap of updates from client with prediction
<sunstar>	seriously though. WHY THE FUUCK was princefakhan banned?
<pingfloyd>	lag gets bad enough and the prediction is way off and you're shooting at "ghosts" or phantoms
<checkmatein1>	pingfloyd: hopefully H5 will not be laggy on dedicated servers
<checkmatein1>	hopefully it will be fun
<pingfloyd>	i.e., the position the game is giving is way off
<checkmatein1>	until then I have to keep playing reach which may cause me to go insane
<pingfloyd>	*position the game is giving your client
<pingfloyd>	I wouldn't get your hopes up
<pingfloyd>	it's console
<pingfloyd>	it will probably be the usual and their fans will still buy it up in masses
<pingfloyd>	there's not really much incentive for them to make it better
<pingfloyd>	on the console, it seems that the average player can't tell the difference between cheating and lag
<checkmatein1>	pingfloyd: cheating = lag at this point
<checkmatein1>	when I shoot someone and they kill me when they are dead on the ground
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<checkmatein1>	is it lag or cheating?
<Time-Warp>	get on xbox 360 with a 56 k
<sunstar>	^
<checkmatein1>	I have fibre optic lol
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<checkmatein1>	and its still laggy
<pingfloyd>	yeah, they're so terrible they favor a shitty connection
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<pingfloyd>	shitty connection is an advantage in their terrible netcode
<Audioburn>	booties
<pingfloyd>	I remember in one game the netcode was so atrocious that you could exploit lag
<pingfloyd>	you'd see these player warping all over the place simply by them making their connections shittier
<checkmatein1>	`lo
<checkmatein1>	*lol
<checkmatein1>	cheatin wank3rs
<pingfloyd>	anyone that makes netcode like that should be taken off the networking of the game
<sunstar>	ahhhh Quake III on 33.6 dialup
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<checkmatein1>	dedicated servers better be good on halo 5
<checkmatein1>	if not I quit life
<sunstar>	but thats a MS title. if you get your wish, you'll have to pay them for xbox live account and a halo account
<checkmatein1>	i already do that for reach
<sunstar>	why you ppl keep rewarding these companies for bad behaviour?!
<checkmatein1>	i shouldnt because reach is owned by the mexicans and is so laggy
<pingfloyd>	sunstar: exactly
<checkmatein1>	but I love halo and couldnt imagine going on another game
<checkmatein1>	except maybe chess but I'm bad at chess
<checkmatein1>	I'm good at halo lol but its laggy and angers me
<pingfloyd>	that's kind of the console world though, they lock you in and then you get excited over mediocrity
<pingfloyd>	each console platform is a monopoly
<pingfloyd>	no drive to be better than competition
<pingfloyd>	that's why the more open the better.
<redcheckers>	checkers > chess
<checkmatein1>	bungie is a beaner ass bitch for not putting halo reach on dedicated servers imo.
<pingfloyd>	there's tons of competition to be better, and the consumer wins
<checkmatein1>	but then again bungie ditched halo for destiny
<checkmatein1>	and destiny flopped megabad

<Time-Warp>	pingfloyd: how do the sprinkler systems work
<Time-Warp>	if you set one off do they all go off
<pingfloyd>	that probably depends on their configuration
<pingfloyd>	they may have a certain area all going off
<pingfloyd>	you don't want those to go off though
<pingfloyd>	the water in them is nasty
<pingfloyd>	standing water
<Time-Warp>	LOL PINGFLOYD
<Error418-Work>	Time-Warp: most systems are individually set off. Each one has to fire off.

<Time-Warp>	so it floods a room with c02
<sunstar>	my friend made one.
<Time-Warp>	sunstar: nice
<Error418-Work>	pingfloyd: The system we have at home is a flowthrough type setup. it only stands water for a week or so.
<sunstar>	expensive design. had to constantly go to the paintpall shop and get more CO2 cartidges
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<Error418-Work>	pingfloyd: it automatically tests the system once a week and in the process flows the water through the entire system.
<sunstar>	maybe if it didnt leak so much  :P

<fahadash>	Real life is scary
<Error418-Work>	pingfloyd: could be worse, I suppose - there's the condos that my inlaws moved into - the sprinker system was the *entire* sprinkler system - indoor and out. The lawn sprinkers were hooked up to the same system so that everything flowed when they watered the lawn.

<Estr>	I sleep all the time
<Estr>	I just woke up from an 4 hour sleep

<Estr>	I'm younger yo
<Estr>	I'm 16
<ceil>	that explains the sleep habits
<DoverMo>	Estr, babu!

<Estr>	That's quite rare
<supposition>	whats the longest you have ever stayed awake
<pingfloyd>	try some melatonin
<Estr>	oh god
<Estr>	i don't know
<Time-Warp>	the empire strikes back
<supposition>	guess what
<Time-Warp>	what movie
<Estr>	I think it was at convention when i was awake for 50 hours +/-
<pingfloyd>	it feels like nyquil, but is natural
<supposition>	that's not so fucked up that I wouldnt believe it
<supposition>	try seven days without sleep
<Estr>	then you'll most likely day
<Estr>	die*
<supposition>	if you make it to eleven days without sleeping, that's when I'll stop believing you.
<pingfloyd>	it also has some other health benefits
<Estr>	but thats not what i meant about fucked up sleeping schedule
<Estr>	I mean like, I can sleep at the weirdest times
<supposition>	hey, you're the guy who can't go more than 50 hours without pussing out.
<Estr>	50 hours is a lot though
<pingfloyd>	at 36 hours I start crashing
<supposition>	not for professionals.
<Estr>	just sitting infront of a tv screen in the dark with tons of swetty people
<pingfloyd>	that's so bad for your health
<supposition>	right, yes, I supposed med school no longer involes terminals
<supposition>	they just jack into the SleepNet and upload their random thoughts and get A pluses
<ceil>	pingfloyd: diphenhydramine and phenylephrine work better for me than melatonin
<ceil>	probably cos i used the fuck out of the latter for a while
<supposition>	ephedrine is the best

<Estr>	yeye whatever im gonna watch a series
<pingfloyd>	ceil: yeah, you probably built up a tolerance to its sleepy effect
<Estr>	I haven't watched a series in a looong time
<ceil>	but the most reliable way to put me to sleep is to smoke half a blunt or so
<Estr>	in fact I've watched like 10 series +/- but never finished one except breaking bad
<Estr>	because of fucking netflix
<pingfloyd>	it's still a good antioxidant and antiinflammatory
<ceil>	too bad my job frowns on my sleep aid : (
<supposition>	a series? you sleep at the WEIRDEST times.
<supposition>	it's only 4 am
<Estr>	can only upload 2/3 of the seasons
<Estr>	its 23:56 here
<supposition>	so it is
<pingfloyd>	ceil: some indica always works
<ceil>	pingfloyd: sadly, it'd work rather well at getting me fired if i got popped on a random
<Time-Warp>	Estr: have you watched hunter x hunter
<pingfloyd>	ceil: I usually turn down jobs that do drug testing
<Estr>	doesnt exist on netflix
<Estr>	never heard of it either

<Time-Warp>	Estr: should be on netflix
<Estr>	well, it isnt
<Time-Warp>	search for hunterxhunter
<pingfloyd>	in fact I get mad if the recruiters don't tell me about it upfront before going further into the application process and wasting my time
<ceil>	lol
<Estr>	couldnt find that either
<pingfloyd>	they really should let you know by second contact with them
<Time-Warp>	wierd
<pingfloyd>	like when they're asking for the right to represent
<ceil>	ideally it should be mentioned on the application
<ceil>	sometimes it is
<Estr>	pingfloyd, well, only option is to not do drugs
<Estr>	doh
<pingfloyd>	really in the job posting if you ask me
<ceil>	right there with "we doin' a background check on yo ass"
<ceil>	word
<Time-Warp>	drugs kill your brain cells
<pingfloyd>	yeah, putting it under requirements

<ceil>	Time-Warp: you're already a brainwashed buffoon, so yeah, maybe drugs aren't for you

<Time-Warp>	pot kills your brain cells
<zyphyer>	Lul

<ceil>	zyphyer: not in Colorado. part of their law says you can't get fired for pot iirc

<pingfloyd>	but when you're stoned you realize how relative stupidity is
<Time-Warp>	zyphyer: does anyone even smoke pot in portland
<idioterna>	you must live a really sad existence then
<AnTi_MTtr>	amazon is a place you can be?
<idioterna>	stupidity is so common
<zyphyer>	Yeah its pretty common.
<AnTi_MTtr>	like they have amazon stores now?
<zyphyer>	I mean Vancouver is like 20 minutes from Portland you can just buy it there
<Time-Warp>	AnTi_MTtr: its the place to be :D
<Time-Warp>	zyphyer: oh snap
<zyphyer>	To buy weed in Washington you don't have to be a resident
<AnTi_MTtr>	Time-Warp: is it just like a pickup center or is it retail too?
<pingfloyd>	yeah, stupidity is everywhere and probably half of it is people walking around like zombies from having to live a life humans were never meant to
<Time-Warp>	zyphyer: what are you studying for in college?
<pingfloyd>	we weren't meant to be transported back and forth between cubicles
<idioterna>	why would you be

<pingfloyd>	they're more than happy to send someone to pound me in the ass prison over a gram of weed if they can
<pingfloyd>	they're basically like the gestapo (SS)

<pingfloyd>	Time-Warp: seemed like there were a lot of tweakers in CA when I was living there for a little while
<AnTi_MTtr>	oh meth
<AnTi_MTtr>	stay away from it yo! stay in school
<pingfloyd>	there, it's like if the cops see just smoking weed, they're happy about it
<Time-Warp>	in sanfrancisco there are crackheads around every corner. you also see people under the influnce of harowin
<AnTi_MTtr>	or take it only as perscribed by your doctor
<Time-Warp>	like you will see people crashed out on the sidewalk and needles everywhere
<AnTi_MTtr>	which is waht way more people do
<AnTi_MTtr>	Time-Warp: yup, ive seen it
<pingfloyd>	yeah, there's a lot of heroin junkies here too
<pingfloyd>	it's pretty disgusting
<AnTi_MTtr>	hell one time my budy got ripped off for shrooms in sf
<AnTi_MTtr>	good times
<pingfloyd>	it's like if they're going to keep doing that filthy habit, at least have the decency to dispose of your needles properly
<AnTi_MTtr>	thats what happens when you try and buy from the first kid you see on the street :P
<zyphyer>	Sorry
<pingfloyd>	one of those POS are going to infect some kid that gets pricked by one of their needles
<idioterna>	that's what happens when drugs aren't legally available from pharmacies

<pingfloyd>	because anyone that goes digging around in trash is too oblivious for their own good
<AnTi_MTtr>	lol you're ircing from class
<zyphyer>	It's a writing class. We're in the library working on our papers 90% of the time
<pingfloyd>	I think needle exchanges were a good program
<honey>	hello
<zyphyer>	Hai
<pingfloyd>	it got the junkies to not leave their needles everywhere
<pingfloyd>	and helped insure they're being sterile and less likely to share needles
<Time-Warp>	pingfloyd: true
<pingfloyd>	sharing needles isn't a junky's preference, but they're so hooked, they'll resort to it.  Society doesn't think of the bigger picture like the long term affect it will have on health of everyone else including themselves.

<Narp>	I wish I could give a fuck about some made up nonsense like those creationist folks.
<grayC>	god/jesus and all that?
<Narp>	Yeah. Must be nice to be motivated and believing in something
<grayC>	thats fk gay bro
<grayC>	a binary black hole created all the matter this "universe"
<grayC>	bbl
<Narp>	Ohh, a binary one. Tell me more of your particular made up nonsense.
<Narp>	Or run away like a damn fool!
<Equinoxdawg>	The thing I hate the most is the ol' "your xx is against my religion, therefore you should stop doing xx right now!" (pls  no >> ##religion)
<treefiddy_>	Equinoxdawg: im on a diet, so you can't eat oreos. sorry
<grant>	so much teen angst
<treefiddy_>	takes one to know one! burn
<Narp>	I'm not a teen.

<Audioburn_work>	yes you are
<swift110-phone>	Lol
<grant>	treefiddy_ how have you been?
<swift110-phone>	Lol
<treefiddy_>	grant: groovy. you?
<Audioburn_work>	Lol
<grant>	pretty good
<grant>	I just have been really tired a bunch
<Narp>	Tell me about the nonsense you believe in that motivates you everyday, Audioburn_work?
<Audioburn_work>	wow. tired? wow.
<Equinoxdawg>	treefiddy_: please be mindful of audiobum, we're not allowed to say the B (burn) word, it's religiously incorrect.
<grant>	tired like I have no motivation for anything
<Audioburn_work>	Narp, I believe in miracles
<grant>	not working has sucked the life out of me
<treefiddy_>	grant: i know that one. that's my wheelhouse
<Audioburn_work>	grant, tired?
<grant>	Audioburn_work tired of life

<Audioburn_work>	you mean like, tired?
<Audioburn_work>	just messin with you man
<Audioburn_work>	im tired too
<Narp>	I'm like a squirrel that doesn't give a fuck about gathering nuts or other necessary squirrely daily activities.
<grant>	I feel tired when I wake up in the morning
<Equinoxdawg>	Damn, ShareX is about 100000m times better than Lightshot.
<Audioburn_work>	you mean you're a failed hunter-gatherer
<Audioburn_work>	you would have died 100000 years ago
<Narp>	Ohh, hunting-gathering is the meaning of life or something?
<grant>	meh
<Audioburn_work>	it was
<grant>	everything feels numb
<Audioburn_work>	i blame race relations
<Myrna>	is this the new defocus
<grant>	things that would make my heart jump out of my chest a year ago seem everywhere
<grant>	Myrna sort of
<grant>	Myrna its fractured a bit
<Myrna>	was there some civil war
<treefiddy_>	it's an epic tale
<grant>	Myrna _naming_ _conventions_
<swift110-phone>	Hey myrna
<Audioburn_work>	Myrna, defocus is dead
<treefiddy_>	but the official story is something about it occupying a # namespace
<Audioburn_work>	##chat does not resemble #defocus in any way
<Narp>	Or maybe an ant that doesnn't care about collecting sugar or digging out tunnels.
<grant>	#defocus is dead long live ##chat
<Narp>	Just a sad, depressed ant.
<grant>	##chat is actually maintained
<Audioburn_work>	Narp, that ant dies
<Narp>	Yep.
<treefiddy_>	the way you guys go on about #defocus
<Audioburn_work>	YOU MUST SURVIVE
<treefiddy_>	im kind of glad i missed out on that
<grant>	treefiddy_ I miss it
<treefiddy_>	haha
<grant>	:'(
<Equinoxdawg>	We have our fearless leader bazhang patrolling the halls hourly.
<treefiddy_>	build something better
<treefiddy_>	lazy ass
<grant>	but I am in the minority
<supposition>	desperate for unmoderated chat on freenode?
<Myrna>	but there are all these people in #defocus
<Myrna>	but it is "unavailable"
<treefiddy_>	plenty of places around this big world for that
<Myrna>	and you can't speak there but all these people are sitting there
<grant>	yeah its a mess
<pingfloyd>	they had to burn the #defocus house down to disinfect it
<grant>	there used to be a redirect
<Adran>	*shrug*
<Adran>	As an op of the former
<Adran>	I can tell you not much changed, except fewer ops
<Adran>	Surprisingly
<pingfloyd>	seems like it
<Adran>	Myrna: There's nobody in #defocus
<Audioburn_work>	##defocus
<Myrna>	yes there are
<treefiddy_>	stupid name anyway
<Audioburn_work>	hey Adrian

<uxfi>	Adran is eating garbage
<Myrna>	there are like 100 people in there
<uxfi>	 think
<uxfi>	or was that Myrna  ?
<Adran>	And I can assure you there were and are no conspiracies about #defocus shutting down
<mmango>	iai
<grant>	Adran lol sure
<Adran>	Myrna: Thats ##unavailable
<Adran>	grant: *shrug*
<Adran>	Don't believe me
<Myrna>	right but that is where you go
*	grant puts on tin foil hat
<Adran>	I don't care.
<Audioburn_work>	#care
<grant>	Adran I was afk for all of it
<Adran>	I washed my hands of all that channel and this channel months ago
<Audioburn_work>	If you are a scared mofo,
<grant>	Adran I was in mexico off the grid for the changeover
<Audioburn_work>	#church
<uxfi>	nite
<Adran>	i have the logs of the channel being cleared, which was hilarious
<Adran>	600 people being cs cleared from a channel. :D
<Audioburn_work>	Adran, pastebin?
<grant>	Adran lol
*	redcheckers coughs loudly
*	treefiddy_ hands redcheckers cepacol and a face mask
<ketas>	meow
*	treefiddy_ shaves half of ketas's whiskers
<hassoon>	what does 'shaving the edge' mean?
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: isnt cepacol a stool softener?
<treefiddy_>	redcheckers: throat spray
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: k
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: i must be thinking of coalease
<ketas>	treefiddy_: hurting cats?
<redcheckers>	AMERICAN_PSYCHO: hey would you shave 15 poodles of unknown ownership in exchange for a klondike bar?
<treefiddy_>	ketas: it doesnt hurt them to shave the whiskers off.t hey grow back
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: how fast does a cat whisker grow?
<ketas>	probably not too fast
<treefiddy_>	redcheckers: only takes a few weeks
<ketas>	hmm
<pingfloyd>	redcheckers: fuck no
<ketas>	cats replace their whiskers i know
<ketas>	:P
<pingfloyd>	klondike bars aren't gold bars
<ketas>	well it's hair!
<ketas>	but why the whiskers!
<pingfloyd>	What would you do for a Klondike bar?  At most maybe go to the store and buy one if I wanted one bad enough.
<forks>	cats whiskers do fall out occasionally, they shed them and grow new ones
<forks>	but if they break one off, it won't grow out
<treefiddy_>	ketas cause they use them for all sorts of things like balance and finding their way through a tight space. it kind of makes them walk funny. it's hilarious
<ketas>	i mean why shave it off
<ketas>	ugh, torture cats
<forks>	yes i bet it would be funny to "shave off" your eyelashes too
<treefiddy_>	it was a joke
<treefiddy_>	you're really reading too much into it
<forks>	"hahaha he can't keep sand out of his eyes"
<ketas>	hahaha
<ketas>	eyewhiskers
<pingfloyd>	how about I shave off your eyelids
<treefiddy_>	bring it
<coldsparrow>	ouch
<Audioburn_work>	butt juice
<coldsparrow>	i just farted
<redcheckers>	coldsparrow: no you didnt
<pingfloyd>	if juice is involved that qualifies as a shart
<coldsparrow>	nah, nothin but net
<redcheckers>	not if the juice is blood
<coldsparrow>	all air.
<coldsparrow>	i tend not to stain my underwear
<treefiddy_>	:( bloodfarts
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: .com ?
<treefiddy_>	.gov
<Equinoxdawg>	.sexy
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: imagine doing a prank gift to someone for april fools day or another occasion, and registering them a really awful sounding web domain as a gift
<ketas>	shave off eyebrows
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: ketaseyebrowshaving.ru ?
<ketas>	not me
<treefiddy_>	redcheckers: do it!
<ketas>	redcheckers: ru, eh?
<coldsparrow>	ketas, shave off peni
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_ "algorehugspenguins.org"
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: or so on.
<redcheckers>	there'd be a ton of different gag gift ideas
<treefiddy_>	i need to look at the new tld's again
<treefiddy_>	there's more jokes here
<redcheckers>	yep. like yourmomisawhale.ninja , or so on
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: maybe emo-stab.ninja ?
<redcheckers>	facepalm.ninja eyepoke.ninja, etc
<treefiddy_>	jessicasimpsontakesitfrom.behind
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: what about the new .sucks domains from icann
<Skizzerz>	too expensive
<redcheckers>	how much are they now?
<Skizzerz>	$250/year
<Skizzerz>	(as of June 1, you can't actually register them right now unless you own a company with the same name)
<redcheckers>	Skizzerz: ah really
<redcheckers>	Skizzerz: that's a weird adaptation to the thing.. i knew some companies sounded upset that it was so expensive
<gildarts>	Yeah, just a little good old fashion extortion. "if you don't buy it now, some loony will buy it and make an attack site out of it."
<redcheckers>	well. they can just make a .llc with a similar name
<redcheckers>	cant they?
<redcheckers>	ie , disney used toy collectors llc could buy disney.sucks if they wanted?
<gildarts>	Well sure, if it is a commentary site, it would be fair use anyway.
<gildarts>	commentary being in air quotes there.
<redcheckers>	in fact, they could go make a bunch of shelf companies, and buy the domains for them to squat too , like how spiegel and uretra llc seems to have a lot of shelf corporations ready for resale
<grayC>	hola Nach0z
<Skizzerz>	question is, why would you do that when you could get disneysucks.com/org/net/info/etc. for significantly cheaper
<redcheckers>	completeness
<redcheckers>	brand consolidation... etc
*	Skizzerz points back to gildarts earlier comment about extortion :)
<redcheckers>	make sure nobody crazier than you buys the other domain and eclipses your glory
<Skizzerz>	now there are hundreds of TLDs, you certainly aren't going to be buying all of them
<redcheckers>	Skizzerz: well. thats just it. you might
<redcheckers>	i bet most of the fox news related tlds are already owned
<redcheckers>	and i'm sure godaddy probably has all the godaddy related ones
<gildarts>	most of the large corp names are probably already bought up.
<redcheckers>	gildarts: i imagine so... but since so many companies can be formed in so many different countries, and still want a tld
*	Skizzerz is incredibly doubtful of that; the popular or relevant TLDs, sure, but all?
<redcheckers>	gildarts: if i were to open up a nice little ltd or co somewhere and try to get a domain, i could
<redcheckers>	gildarts: whether its in dutch guinea, or vanatau, or fiji, or america or so on
<grayC>	where's my shoes
<redcheckers>	there's nothing to keep me from registering it to a .com addy... if its not taken
<jenni>	Hi*
<redcheckers>	jenni: hi, have you seen yano?
<redcheckers>	grayC: the right shoe is by the toilet and the left shoe is in the kitchen by the broom
<jenni>	have you?
<gildarts>	Sure... not. I don't think I was saying anything that would prevent that...
<grayC>	I will check ty
<redcheckers>	jenni: yes. i saw yano. and yano is yano
<gildarts>	s/not//
<jenni>	redcheckers, Hym, no spanish :(
<redcheckers>	jenni: su no hablamos espagnol?
<dw1>	spaghettini
<jenni>	What did you say?
<redcheckers>	jenni: yep.
<redcheckers>	dw1: i'd rather have a pepperoncini
<redcheckers>	with some cheese sauce to dip in
<redcheckers>	and then a side of garlic bread, to dip as well
<grayC>	nop have to go with the backup shoes
<gildarts>	I really shouldn't indulge the desire to feed a Markov bot with ##chat and then have it post to twitter.
<jenni>	So, have you gotten a job yet
<redcheckers>	grayC: k
<redcheckers>	grayC: by the way, is the C in your name checkers related?
<dw1>	i aint sayin jenni's a gold digger
<grayC>	maybe :)
<redcheckers>	gildarts: maybe give it a markov chain
<grayC>	im driving someone somewhere now bbl
<redcheckers>	gildarts: or ask it about Markov's time spent at a University in Siberia...
<redcheckers>	grayC: have a safe drive... remember texting can cause accidents
<grayC>	idk how to text and use no cell phone until encryption is mandatary
<grayC>	rollin a cig
<grayC>	cyas o/

<treefiddy_>	i'd go after congress with weapons
<treefiddy_>	and if they ever dicked around with the budget, they'd get sequestered into old military barracks
<treefiddy_>	and they'd stay there, until they could approve something
<Branes>	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/532297/ha/VOTE_2016.jpg
<introvert->	i'd love to be locked in a room with a bunch of soldiers. where do i sign up.
<treefiddy_>	1-800-marines
<redcheckers>	introvert-: what if they are unshowered soldiers
<introvert->	on it.
<introvert->	that's a little different.
<treefiddy_>	marines go into the field all week and return on the weekend for showers and liberty. you'll be fine
<redcheckers>	introvert-: imagine an entire platoon of sweaty, dirty soldiers hauling 120 pound backpacks and drinking metallic tasting water through straws
<introvert->	mmm.
<redcheckers>	introvert-: imagine the body odor.
<introvert->	mmmm.
<hmir>	mMM SEXY!
<redcheckers>	now imagine the taste of the socks
<treefiddy_>	the water was never metallic tasting
<introvert->	mmm, mmm good.
<treefiddy_>	it was plastic tasting
<introvert->	why are you doing this.
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: no it was metallic tasting
<treefiddy_>	i disagree
<treefiddy_>	our canteens were plastic
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: you just drank too much koolaid and lost your ability to taste anything
<introvert->	ebay has been recommending shiny suit cases for me. thanks alot.
<redcheckers>	introvert-: you're welcome, did you bid on that first one?
<treefiddy_>	redcheckers: haha. i hated those packs of drink stuff in the mre. it made it worser
<introvert->	no.
<introvert->	the only thing i'd keep in a suit case is someones body.
<redcheckers>	introvert-: maybe you could bid on a nice bride from syria ?
<introvert->	probably hmir.
<introvert->	in little tiny pieces.
<redcheckers>	hmir: are you a syrian ebay bride?

<redcheckers>	introvert-: i don't know. but the news said that isis was auctioning off those cute yazidi chicks as brides
<redcheckers>	introvert-: and i've heard of a lot of temporary success stories for the phillipines and russian dating sites
<hmir>	Brothas need money for guns!
<redcheckers>	where it usually lasts for like 3 to 4 years and then they have a violent messy divorce
<introvert->	i wish someone from another country would try and buy me. i'd be a great wife.
<introvert->	just dont ask me to cook or clean.
<introvert->	or raise kids.
<swift110-phone>	Hmm
<redcheckers>	introvert-: oh are you female?
<swift110-phone>	U could ask your mom
<redcheckers>	swift110-phone: my mom is probably female, yes
<introvert->	yes.
<introvert->	all woman.
<redcheckers>	introvert-: then why not try it
<JessicaJ>	hopefully
<redcheckers>	introvert-: maybe try for a guy from the UAE they usually have a lot of money
<introvert->	because i don't want to be sold into sex trafficking.
<redcheckers>	introvert-: you think they wouldnt really marry you and would just turn you into a rental bride?
<supposition>	you cant guarantee she'll come
<supposition>	all you can do is powerfuck her and hope for the best
<introvert->	oh i'll come.
<introvert->	bad timing but still.

<JessicaJ>	treefiddy_, interesting greeting you have there
<treefiddy_>	i try to mix it up
<treefiddy_>	i guess i was thinking ofa  hound dog
<JessicaJ>	its like a cross between a wolf howl and an indian chant
<JessicaJ>	lol yeah

<JessicaJ>	if u say so
*	JessicaJ mumbles.. weirdo... 
<JessicaJ>	:P

<JessicaJ>	uh huh
<treefiddy_>	how did you know
<JessicaJ>	o.o
<Thete>	wut?
<JessicaJ>	lucky guess :P
<Thete>	Are you hindu?
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: the wolf isn't your spirit animal
<treefiddy_>	thats what i saw on my vision quest
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: then you need glasses bro
<JessicaJ>	the one where he was drunk
<JessicaJ>	that vision
<treefiddy_>	haha
<diogenese>	Sweat lodge involved?
<JessicaJ>	:P
<Thete>	Since when do Indians have vision quests?
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: can you tell the difference between the different canines?
<treefiddy_>	i injected 10 marijuanas that night
<Thete>	or spirit animals
<JessicaJ>	okay high.. my bad
<Thete>	All they have is call centers and holy cows
<treefiddy_>	redcheckers: yeah
<Thete>	and sewage in the streets
<redcheckers>	Thete: phillipines call centers > india call centers
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: apparently not.
<JessicaJ>	Thete, not that kind of indian... the feather indian
<treefiddy_>	american indians
<JessicaJ>	yeah
<JessicaJ>	that
<Thete>	And bathe in the ganges
<Thete>	Those aren't indians
<redcheckers>	Thete: these days there's a lot of chemicals in the ganges
<Thete>	Stupid european settlers thought they were from india
<redcheckers>	dont think i'd want to even drink it
<redcheckers>	Thete: not all european settlers thought that, some thought they were demons spawned by the christian devil
<treefiddy_>	redcheckers: why do you think this? wolves are very different looking from foxes, coyotes, domestic dogs.
<Thete>	and columbus enslaved and raped them to mine gold
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: you're sure you didn't see a red colored dog?
<JessicaJ>	very different treefiddy_ ? not that different
<treefiddy_>	quit screwing around with my bullshit stories gosh
<JessicaJ>	lol
<redcheckers>	Thete: and he returned with syphillis
<treefiddy_>	they're distinguishable enough
<redcheckers>	and wore a mask when in the court.
<Thete>	You could always be one of those yoga new age hipsters
<redcheckers>	Thete: cristolpho colombo, died of syphillis
<JessicaJ>	like a husky or alaskan malamute look similar to wolves
<Thete>	argue over who's fucking the yoga instructor the most
<treefiddy_>	you're a wolf
<redcheckers>	no you're not
<Thete>	and flaunt your spiritual superiority over everyone
<treefiddy_>	or are you represented by another animal?
<treefiddy_>	a feline?
<JessicaJ>	treefiddy_, who are u asking? name names
<redcheckers>	Thete: my spiritual superiority > yours
<treefiddy_>	JessicaJ: whoever wants to answer
<JessicaJ>	okay
<Thete>	Oh yeah?  How many candles are you burning right now?  How long have you been gluten intolerant?
<treefiddy_>	im encouraging group participation
<redcheckers>	Thete: oh, i'm not gluten intolerant ^_^
<Thete>	You should work on that
<redcheckers>	Thete: and i'm not burning any candles, i already burned enough.
<treefiddy_>	i eat what i want
<treefiddy_>	this is why im fat
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: no you don't. right now you want some caramel corn and a large hamburger
<treefiddy_>	haha
<Thete>	Just don't become one of those plant killing vegetarian monsters
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: and you dont have them to eat.
<treefiddy_>	i could go get them
<introvert->	go then.
<introvert->	what are you waiting for.
<treefiddy_>	i dont want food
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: you could. but the fact that you havent proves my point
<redcheckers>	yes you do
<redcheckers>	you are hungry right now.
<treefiddy_>	no
<Oddity>	Shove hamburgers in my mouf
<treefiddy_>	i am not
<redcheckers>	yes you are!!
<treefiddy_>	nope
<redcheckers>	'k'
<introvert->	ew meat.
<treefiddy_>	since ive been exercising my ass off my appetite has shrank
<treefiddy_>	it's very nice
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: thats just cause you're dehydrated
<introvert->	are you getting a six pack.
<Thete>	I should do that tonight
<redcheckers>	no, he's already got like 4 six packs
<introvert->	sexy.
<treefiddy_>	i have a keg
<treefiddy_>	im like...
<treefiddy_>	2 months from a 6 pack
<redcheckers>	lately every time i exercise my muscles seem to spasm and twitch until i pass out afterwards x.x
<treefiddy_>	but im not willing to do the diet for it
<treefiddy_>	i love beer
<redcheckers>	lol diet? i'm too lazy for a diet, i prefer to just do ab curls and crunches and v-sits
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: do you ever get bored and do an upside down headstand against a wall, or hang down backwards from a chair or bed?
<treefiddy_>	redcheckers: no. back not strong enough yet
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: oh what happened?
<redcheckers>	did you re-enact the fight between batman and bane?
<treefiddy_>	haha
<introvert->	i wish my freaking laptop would charge holy shit.
<redcheckers>	introvert-: it would. if you bought a new battery
<treefiddy_>	got rearended while i was sitting still. she was going 35ish
<treefiddy_>	didn't brake
<redcheckers>	introvert-: you see those itx boards that can run off of a marine battery?
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: ah. a female driver eh
<introvert->	the battery isnt the problem.
<treefiddy_>	yea
<redcheckers>	introvert-: the charge controller?
<introvert->	yes.
<introvert->	and women are great drivers shut up.
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: the last time i got hit it was by a female driver ...
<treefiddy_>	ive been in 2 accidents
<Thete>	since when?
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: and the time before that it was by a drunk guy exiting the bar parking lot of the bar i was going to
<introvert->	you guys deserved it.
<treefiddy_>	both were females
<introvert->	i'd ram your cat too.
<introvert->	well your car. not your cat.
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: since he was drunk, he was super fast about admitting fault and giving me the insurance stuff
<treefiddy_>	i deserved to be stopped in traffic and you plow into me at 35 cause you were busy on your phone?
<treefiddy_>	oh man
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: your own fault for not being busy on your phone and causing an accident first.
<Thete>	I really wish they'd ban cell phone driving
<JessicaJ>	.. #wimminzlogic
<Thete>	$500 fine or something
<redcheckers>	Thete: in many places they do... but the enforcement is well, lacking
<treefiddy_>	this was before then
<treefiddy_>	it's illegal in CA now
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: imagine it though... a drunk guy at a bar.
<Thete>	They should set up cell phone cameras
<redcheckers>	it was like completely unexpected
<treefiddy_>	yeah =/ sorry to hear that man
<Thete>	rather than red light cameras
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: shrug. my car had been for sale, and his insurance totalled it for like 60 bucks less than my sale sign
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: so it didnt turn out too bad.
<Thete>	Almost every person I almost get into some close call, is some middle to over 40 woman in a SUV gabbin away on their phone
<treefiddy_>	someone would have talked you down more than that
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: nah... they had some company out of missouri
<redcheckers>	i forget the name of it.
<treefiddy_>	but idk. it's fine if i do the physical therapy. ive just been slacking
<introvert->	women and phones blah blah blah.
<introvert->	men and their big mouths.
<treefiddy_>	mutual of omaha haha
<introvert->	acting innocent.
<redcheckers>	they had ' traders insurance company'
<treefiddy_>	i.was.stopped.at.a.stoplight.behind.a.line.of.cars.
<treefiddy_>	i was innocent
<introvert->	NO.
<treefiddy_>	was i not supposed to be there?
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: you're lucky. i had to write to the hospital administrator before i could get phys therapy... even after surgery
<introvert->	karma.
<treefiddy_>	ouch
<treefiddy_>	lmao karma
<treefiddy_>	hahaha
<introvert->	mhmm.
<treefiddy_>	and my horoscope too probably
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: some stoned guys hit my old nova one time when everyone but them stopped for a fire truck, 28 feet from a fire station
<treefiddy_>	oh man
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: they had this look on their face of oh "#@$$ and we're stoned too "
<introvert->	well i rolled a truck off a cliff and i wasnt even in it.
<redcheckers>	introvert-: female driver?

<introvert->	fuck off.
<JessicaJ>	LOL
<treefiddy_>	roflmao
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: a really funny time, i was on a bicycle, and a post office truck tries to mow me over but stops in time
<redcheckers>	i was on a sidewalk, and they were exiting a driveway.
<treefiddy_>	because karma
<treefiddy_>	mirite
<introvert->	yes.
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: imagine what would happen to their pension if they did hit me
<introvert->	i hope some grandma takes out your car tomorrow.
<introvert->	texting her man.
<redcheckers>	introvert-: me too, i have comp and collision
<treefiddy_>	redcheckers: yeah you'd have owned em
<redcheckers>	introvert-: and it'd make for a funny female driver anecdote
<introvert->	i don't mind hitting a car, or a person.
<redcheckers>	me neither, as long as i'm using a baseball bat or sledgehammer
<introvert->	but if i see an animal in the road im gunna slam on the brakes.
<redcheckers>	but i dont want to do it with another car or a bicycle
<treefiddy_>	that's how you cause accidents
<treefiddy_>	usually a out of control rolly one
<redcheckers>	treefiddy_: no, i cause accidents by stopping at yellow lights
<introvert->	#catlivesmatter.
<redcheckers>	introvert-: #@$$ your cat's breath?
<treefiddy_>	#itsyouorthem
<redcheckers>	introvert-: only joking, i like other peoples cats

<redcheckers>	so what's there to do in new dheli, do they still have that one post that a lot of tourists would go visit?
<redcheckers>	princefakhan: oh just some matsumaya thingy that i got a few years ago... i dont have it handy.
<princefakhan>	Post? Do you mean Qutub Minaret
<redcheckers>	not sure ^_^

<redcheckers>	princefakhan: its like this big round cylinder, sticking up out of the ground
<redcheckers>	sort of like a post or a really large nail
<princefakhan>	is it made of medal
<redcheckers>	i dont remember
<princefakhan>	there is one Ashoka Pillar in Qutub Minar.
<princefakhan>	Ashoka the Great has inscripted it himself iirc
<princefakhan>	*inscripted on it
<redcheckers>	hmmn maybe that is it then? do you have a photo somewhere?
<princefakhan>	its known for not rusting.
<princefakhan>	lemme google
<redcheckers>	ah found it
<redcheckers>	yep apparently that's the same one.
<princefakhan>	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/QtubIronPillar.JPG
<redcheckers>	princefakhan: apparently it has a fence around it now, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_pillar_of_Delhi#/media/File:Qutub_minar_iron_pillar.JPG
<princefakhan>	yes it has
<redcheckers>	so what else is there to see in delhi?
<princefakhan>	interestingly. there are a lot of these iron pillars by ashoka all over north india
<redcheckers>	oh?
<redcheckers>	maybe i should visit india x.x
<redcheckers>	i just think that if i were to visit india i'd end up wanting to stay longer since it's so old there'd be a lot to see
<princefakhan>	most of the monuments in India were built by the mughal emperor
<redcheckers>	i doubt that.
<honey>	what i miss?
<princefakhan>	Red Fort. Jama Masjid
<honey>	we're going to india?
<redcheckers>	most emperors dislike building things themselves and just order others to do it
<princefakhan>	redcheckers: lol
<redcheckers>	if i were an emperor i'd probably do the same...
<princefakhan>	ofc. lol
<princefakhan>	If u r to visit India there is a lot of stuff from diff periods
*	NotJavacat is now known as Javacat
<redcheckers>	it would take too long x.x
<princefakhan>	but delhi has most of the stuff from medieval period
<redcheckers>	visiting the u.s. is a lot easier, only a few centuries of stuff.
<princefakhan>	hmmm.
<princefakhan>	US doesn't has much of a history?
<princefakhan>	I'm surprised
<redcheckers>	yeah, its only a few centuries old...
<princefakhan>	ah right. most of it must be after Columbus discovered America I guess
<honey>	i wanted to go to Syria before they destroyed it.
<princefakhan>	have they destroyed it.
<honey>	in Homs and Damascus.
<honey>	yeah
<RandPaul-2016>	well in 250 years they still managed to become the richest most powerful country on the planet
<princefakhan>	oww! thats sad.
<honey>	its not totally destroyed
<princefakhan>	come on! I wanted to visit damascus too.
<marienz>	honey: please try not to want to go to somewhere I am, in case the getting destroyed in response is not a one-off
<princefakhan>	I have to see the Assassin's HQ. its around there.
<redcheckers>	why bother.
<honey>	marienz, :(
<honey>	lol
<redcheckers>	if you just become important first the assassins will come to you
<princefakhan>	hehe. not the assassins these days.
<redcheckers>	no?
<redcheckers>	princefakhan: well, first become important
<princefakhan>	There was this guy in around 10th century. Hassan-i-Sabbah
<princefakhan>	he made a brotherhood called hashashins.
<princefakhan>	hashashins were induced to a drug called hashash. and tricked them into thinking they were in paradise.
<princefakhan>	and Hassan-i-Sabbah promised them paradise after they died.
<hhmmm>	HiS :o
<princefakhan>	so he got a loyal army of Assassins.
<redcheckers>	princefakhan: i'd rather get ab al hiwat.
<princefakhan>	then he carried out certain political assassinations in the name of peace.
<princefakhan>	these assassins were known to perform assassinations and blend in the crowd without anyone noticiing.
<princefakhan>	The word Assassin actually came from this arabi word hashash.
<supferrets>	plata o plomo
<princefakhan>	the Assassins' Creed franchise is based on these assassins.
<princefakhan>	actually the game is based on a novel named Alamut.

<flipapy>	nah i diddnt suspect anyone in particular Equinoxdawg i was just wondering since i noticed the information on the help site
<klixa>	finally maing progress with this stupid broken pc....
<flipapy>	hey klixa whats wrong?
<princefakhan>	klixa: whats the status now?
<klixa>	flipapy: wont boot into desktop... wont let me refresh cause says drive is locked... finally got it to boot into linux tho
<princefakhan>	btw, my hdd is broken too. :(
<princefakhan>	bios won't read it.
<flipapy>	sounds good klixa
<flipapy>	princefakhan, did you try to salvage it through gparted?
<princefakhan>	drive is locked? what does that mean?
<klixa>	i did all the command line stuff too , fixboot, etc... i think i just gotta back the drive off and wipe it
<klixa>	princefakhan: yeah i dunno whaat it means buyt i tried EVERY fix i could find online..nothing
<flipapy>	maybe it was an encrypted drive and you forgot your password?
<klixa>	no flipapy
<princefakhan>	flipapy: didn't try that.
<klixa>	its just some stupid windows thing
<flipapy>	i did that once, i didnt care because it wasnt anyhting important saved, i was just testing out what it would be like to have encrypted drives
<flipapy>	princefakhan, are you running a linux os right now?
<princefakhan>	Windows.
<klixa>	flipapy: i *think* like if i had to guess its something to do with having a cirrupt drive...cause when you run a chkdsk, it says "cannot lock your drive in order to continue"...could be unrelated, but thats my guess
<princefakhan>	technically I'm running nothing.
<flipapy>	oh... idk what you can do there, but if you run disk manager as admin, you ca likely dosomething
*	lenny is now known as Corgi
*	Corgi is now known as Lenny
<flipapy>	is it an ssd or an hdd klixa ?
<klixa>	learnd something about this laptop tho... it boots UEFI usb's but not legacy usb's
<sheep>	 wat
<klixa>	soooo, i have to put windos on external hd's and boot in legacy mode, but can use usb's for linux
<flipapy>	did you go to bios and enable legasy protocols or something?
<MrElendig>	klixa: just use uefi
<klixa>	flipapy: default setting is uefi boot, but ythat wouldnt let me boot windows on any type of device
<princefakhan>	ahh! I have to get a wired kbd too. my wireless one won't work.
<klixa>	MrElendig: windows wont boot unless i put it in legacy mode tho
<Audioburn_work>	old people burning old people burning, put your hands up
<MrElendig>	klixa: bs
<rosenberg>	hi
<flipapy>	windows 7 doesnt have support for uefi? but windows 8 does
<MrElendig>	windows 7 does support uefi
<flipapy>	oh cool
<klixa>	i have windows 8.1 and it wouldnt work..thats all i know
<MrElendig>	go talk to MS support
<MrElendig>	or better, install gnu/linux
<flipapy>	my laptop doesnt have uefi and if it does idk it
<klixa>	i have osx...this laptop im working on isnt mine
<klixa>	this laptop is just stupid
<flipapy>	oh ok
<klixa>	MrElendig: as for your bs comment, i know it *should* work... but for some reason it doesnt
<flipapy>	did you try ##hardware? lots of good know how in there
<klixa>	the usb with linux on it, taht is running on the laptop right this second had win 8.1 on it 15 min aho and it wouldnt boot... so its not the usb drive
<princefakhan>	klixa: back up all the data to another drive and then format the lappy's hdd.
<klixa>	thats the plan
<princefakhan>	then try installing windows.
<princefakhan>	:)
<klixa>	but unbuntu wont mount it, said its in an unsafe state...lol
<princefakhan>	ohh!
<Equinoxdawg>	bash it with a hammer, see if that puts it in a safer state
<flipapy>	is the drive in question an hdd?
<klixa>	flipapy: yeah, the internal laptop drive
<princefakhan>	klixa: maybe try gparted
<princefakhan>	http://gparted.org/
<flipapy>	is it something you're trying to salvage or just you know, might as well tooss it and use a diff drive? did you check it for stuck reader pin?

<banzai>	oh i meant it in the friendly, you are such a stupid cunt why dont u die, kind of way#

<Equinoxdawg>	predestination (2014) is a good film.
<rosenberg>	i will check out the trailer for it Equinoxdawg
<klixa>	my fav movies i saw in the past year were Lego Movie, Frozen, God Isn;t Dead (despit not being a christian, tho i dounbt too many non christians would like it), Her.... um thats all i can remeber for now
<rosenberg>	thanks
<rosenberg>	wasnt her about the computer?
<klixa>	rosenberg: yeah
<rosenberg>	with joaquin phoenix?
<klixa>	yeah
<rosenberg>	ahh
<rosenberg>	yeah
<rosenberg>	it was weird
<klixa>	i liked it
<rosenberg>	i cant stand scarlett johansson to be honest
<klixa>	but yeah, it was strange
<klixa>	well at least you never have to see her...but her voice is the worst thing about her...one of those raspy manly voices like demi mooore
<rosenberg>	exactly
<rosenberg>	i dont think shes a good actress
<rosenberg>	at all
<klixa>	shes pretty tho
<rosenberg>	but she seems to be popular
<rosenberg>	she is
<klixa>	shes in one of my fav movies... Lost In Translation
<rosenberg>	it is good
<klixa>	i tjhink i first saw he in ghost world, and compared to whoever played enid, shes soooooo boring
<klixa>	no life, no vitality, no charisma
<klixa>	but in the translation movie her character is supposed to be depressed...so its not as annoying... but she is like that in everything
<princefakhan_>	I too don't like her voice.
<rosenberg>	i think she's amateurish
<klixa>	omg Butt3rfly , lmfao at my child.. theres an ant crawling on the floor...and shes leaning towards it and screaming... its like shes scared but nosy at the same time
<Butt3rfly>	lol
<Butt3rfly>	cute
<princefakhan_>	I remeber my nephew doing that.
<princefakhan_>	except it was a goat.
<klixa>	i put some ant baits in the corners...and im supposed to not kill the ants so they can eat the bait and kill their colony,..its hard resisting to urge to DESTROY them
<princefakhan_>	:D
<klixa>	i see like 15 a day, so its not an infestation or antyhing...but ugh
<klixa>	lol a goat
<princefakhan_>	yeah.
<princefakhan_>	he was trying to touch its horn.
<klixa>	kis go through weird plhases...like at 8 momths, they are fearless
<princefakhan_>	and crying at the same time
<klixa>	everything is all good to a baby... but then as toddlers...suddenly its like "wait, wtf is that? i dont think i like that, or maybe i do...i dunno"
<princefakhan_>	lets touch it.
<klixa>	bravery!!!
<klixa>	im sceeeeered, but imma touch it anyway
<princefakhan_>	cuz I'm brave!

<hhmmm>	meanwhile parents are gonna state the obvious liek they know everything
<klixa>	hhmmm: ? give an example
<flipapy>	hey hhmmm have you ever seen a classroom response to a question the entire class knows?
<Fowler>	Huh
<klixa>	i am assuimg hhmmm means sying something like "its just a horn it wont hurt you" or something
<Fowler>	Apparently some people even reported that Manny had an injured right arm/shoulder before the fight
<Fowler>	Sounds like it isn't pure baloney
<flipapy>	did they report it before the fight?
<Fowler>	flipapy: They reported medications he was taking but not the injury itself
<flipapy>	do they have the doctored records, achem, i mean... soctor's records?
<flipapy>	doctor's*
<flipapy>	hehe
<Fowler>	And they had asked about informatoin about various medications before the fight for a "sore shoulder"
<flipapy>	that is just a joke, i dont think it was rigged
<Fowler>	But they never actually reported an injury
<Fowler>	Probably just hoped he could fight through it
<flipapy>	eh... he almost owon anyway
<flipapy>	won*
<Fowler>	I didn't even think it was close
<Fowler>	At all
<flipapy>	or did mayweather almost lose.. hmmmmmm?
<flipapy>	i think it was, it was like 109 109 109 consistently on paquao and mayweather was like 110 110 thats pretty close imo
<Fowler>	Well yeah, but losing nine out of twelve rounds isn't a close fight
<flipapy>	did you know paquiano is a congressman? in his country
<Fowler>	It's hard to get a bigger differential than that without getting knocked down or losing points for a lowblow or something
<flipapy>	Fowler, the point is that the rounds are only lost by 1 point, so obviously it seems that mayweather is just mre experienced at the point systemm play
<Fowler>	You can't lose by more than one point per round unless you get knocked down
<Fowler>	It's 10-9 unless there's some penalty for some fighter
<flipapy>	oh, nvm i thought they had to nail a point for every validadet landed blow
<flipapy>	but nvm, i dont like boxing anyway
<flipapy>	i was just yapping about tha shoulder
<Fowler>	If you look at the round by round breakdown he threw the most punches in round four and then the fewest in round five
<Fowler>	Seems to support the story of him hurting his shoulder early int he fight
<Fowler>	And round four was his most busy round
<flipapy>	could be man, idk.
<Fowler>	Sucks either way
<Fowler>	Not a good fight
<flipapy>	i wonder if bacon goes with any kind of fruit
<Fowler>	flipapy: Sure it does
<flipapy>	lol
<Fowler>	Sweet and salty
<Fowler>	Mango banana bacon
<flipapy>	side of fruit in the morning with 5 strips of bacon and 3 eggs and a texas toast
<flipapy>	lol
<rosenberg>	burnt bacon is nice
<flipapy>	mmmm thats a maybe man
<Fowler>	I usually have three eggs scrambled with onions, peppers, and ham
<Fowler>	With coffee
<flipapy>	i like juicy burn bacon, when its all dried up... blech
<Fowler>	And a glass of juice
<flipapy>	thats wy i like my bacon thick
<Fowler>	Thin bacon sucks
<Fowler>	Crispy bacon sucks
<Fowler>	(for me)
<flipapy>	you gotta bake it on like 135*F for like 30 min at least then you can fry it up real hot on HI HI, not just HI, HI HI  lol, then it gets all cryspy on the outside and juicy in the middle mmmm
<flipapy>	bacon
<checkmatein1>	hi
<rosenberg>	i like when the fat is burnt
<rosenberg>	and crispy
<flipapy>	oooo the gristle
<flipapy>	haha, yeah but its not good without the meatty part
<rosenberg>	yeah
<flipapy>	juicy meatty with some gristle
<rosenberg>	crispy gristle
<flipapy>	lol
<flipapy>	but not chewy crispy
<flipapy>	i think its all about the time on the grill
<rosenberg>	yes
<NotSmirks>	super duper terrorist 123
<flipapy>	if it's baked low for about an hour, then it's still red inside, but safe to eat, so (talking beef here, not pork) so after that it only needs like 2 mins on the grill on high fire, maybe not even 2 min
<flipapy>	to get that juicy crisp and tender inside safe to eat
<flipapy>	WOO!! im a grill me some meat this sumer baby!! YEAH!
*	NotSmirks dreams about 420
<flipapy>	the only problem i have with bud is that it's over hyped
<flipapy>	its like coffe or beer or some strong digestion herb, or some other over the counter herb/ medicininal/ or even recreational substance, sugar highs, triptophan highs,  emotionally affecting bthroom mists and candles, all these things are too weak to make a ig deal about.
<flipapy>	but for some reason herb is some huge big deal....
<NotSmirks>	im super duper sorry i was dreaming about 420
<flipapy>	lol
<flipapy>	nah, i just wonder sometimes. i eman for bud? really? cmon man, thats the worst reason ever, imo

<Fowler>	Is this fun for you?
<Fowler>	Getting banned on purpose?
<Equinoxdawg>	bisextile: r u a badboy
<Fowler>	flipapy: Weed is nothing like coffee or sugar highs or tryptophan highs or anything else
<NotSmirks>	look out we got a badass
<Fowler>	That's ridiculous
<Audioburn_work>	yo
<flipapy>	i wonder if someone that does the wrong thing just for the sake of doing the wrong thing actually understands how that wrong thing came to be classified as wrong...
<sud0>	he said the N word
<sud0>	nitrogen
<Fowler>	bisextile: How can I be edgy like you?
<Fowler>	Did you go to school for that?
<flipapy>	nitrogen makes up the majority of the atmosphere
<Audioburn_work>	whats up my nitrogen
<NotSmirks>	super duper
<flipapy>	you could say nitter, that might fly by without an issue
<NotSmirks>	how about we not refer to the N-word at all
<Fowler>	Bazhang is slackin'
<flipapy>	sure, i have no issue with it
<Butt3rfly>	I just challenged my teenager to a H²O and he shocked me with his intelligence, as usual
<Fowler>	To a water?
<AnTi_MTtr>	how do you challenge someone to a water
<Butt3rfly>	I just challenged my teenager to a H²O question*
<Fowler>	Can you do subscript instead of superscript?
<flipapy>	i cant do H^(2)O
<reynir>	I just received a reply to an email I sent 4 months ago
<reynir>	The reply said I could send them a phone number if I want an answer
<reynir>	-.-
<flipapy>	you know a blank keybaord that i writ on in pencil and erase every night will deinfately teach me where all my keys are

<lala>	Test.
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<CHVNX>	ERROR
<Time-Warp>	SUP CHVNX
<Time-Warp>	FreezingCold: you there
<CHVNX>	So, I found a blog written by a popular professional wrestler.
<Time-Warp>	CHVNX: what does it say
<Oddity>	mostly unintelligible grunting
<CHVNX>	It's American-styled right-win Libertarian politics.
<CHVNX>	right-wing*
<Time-Warp>	oh snap
<CHVNX>	There are only two entries. The most recent is from March of this year.
<CHVNX>	In fact, both entries are from the same day.
<CHVNX>	adventuresofcitizenx.com
<CHVNX>	Glen Jacobs.  Kane.
<Scourjee>	Hi
<Scourjee>	I have posted part 1 of On Beyond Time & The Other Side
<CHVNX>	Everyone and more has beyond time capabilities, they might not realise, but they do.
<Scourjee>	Yes
<Oddity>	what?
<CHVNX>	The other side is not a single plane of existence. It's more of a collection of events. I discovered something that profoundly changed my view on this world, even how I operate on it.
<CHVNX>	Scourjee: You are mentally ill. You need to seek help, as soon as possible. You believe insane things, and then tell other people.
<Scourjee>	I did not invent it
<CHVNX>	Also, take a writing course.
<Scourjee>	It was Recieved
<Scourjee>	Whats wrong with my writing
<Scourjee>	I was compromised for years
<Scourjee>	I never used any grammar or capitals
<CHVNX>	"Today I was warned about the "New Age Movement" spiritually or such on IRC. I believe the user who warned me of this was compromised. Their name was JesusAmen something, and they constantly pasted bible passages."
<CHVNX>	You are ill, Scourjee.
<CHVNX>	Scourjee: have you talked to a mental helth professional about your ideas?
<CHVNX>	You should, pal.  Seriously.
<CHVNX>	In fact, talk to two of them, independant of each other. Confirm it.
<Scourjee>	No
<Scourjee>	I can't risk being compromised again
<CHVNX>	Always get a second opinion when in doubt, and it's obvious that you have been ignoring the swarms of people telling you that you seem ill.
<Scourjee>	Well, unsure of what will happen
<CHVNX>	Paranoid schitzo affective.
<Oddity>	There's never a 't' there
<Scourjee>	They use ambient frequencies to block it out of your head
<Scourjee>	Thanks, your part of the slide
<Scourjee>	It has a no form factor
<Scourjee>	Does anybody know information on the word xenotype
<Oddity>	Like what?
<Scourjee>	I've intercepted rogue signals many times but I've only been able to write down one
<Scourjee>	Before I forgot
<Scourjee>	It was just xenotype repeated
<Oddity>	http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/xenotype
<Scourjee>	Then the signal got jammed I believe
<Equinoxdawg>	Putting on your tin-foil hat will stop those rouge signals.
<Scourjee>	This is what I mean
<Equinoxdawg>	s/rouge/rogue
<CHVNX>	Scourjee: Please elaborate on yoru proof of the existence of The Energy Dimension.
<Scourjee>	They use certain keywords and sentence structure to trigger automated exploits
<Scourjee>	I've seen it
<rosenberg>	Scourjee: that's it
<Scourjee>	Others have seen it too
<Butt3rfly>	and todays keyword is 'nutjob'
<CHVNX>	Howdy, Butt3rfly. How goes it?
<treefiddy_>	nutter
<Scourjee>	Butt3rfly:  Is compromised
<Butt3rfly>	haha
<Scourjee>	Most here are compromised.  It's my fault as they increase defences wherever I go
<treefiddy_>	we're all compromised
<Oddity>	br? br? gib moneys
<CHVNX>	Scourjee: did you find the device they planted at the based of your spinal column yet?
<treefiddy_>	and hunting for you
*	Butt3rfly comprimises treefiddy_ 
<treefiddy_>	this time there will be no escape
<Scourjee>	They have no use for physical items
<rosenberg>	Scourjee: i was compromised a few years back
<Scourjee>	They can do it all remotely
<treefiddy_>	oh babeh
<CHVNX>	Scourjee: Honest question: are you familiar with Dianetic theory?
<rosenberg>	i went for my first auditing session for the Church of Scientology and they inserted a cold aluminium tube into my anus.  The readings were off the charts, Scourjee
<treefiddy_>	thetons will set you free
<CHVNX>	Thetans*
<Scourjee>	The only way to protect yourself and others from indiscriminate directed energy weaponry strikes is enough information saturation for the entire populus
<Scourjee>	No CHVNX I have never heard of it
<Oddity>	hahaha
<CHVNX>	They will also use your body like a prison and mental facility, so no, they will not set you free. You are, in fact, a thetan. Actually, you are a thetan that is infected with thetans.
<Oddity>	Schizophrenic people are simultaneously funny and annoying
<treefiddy_>	itdoesntmatterhowcrazypeoplespellthings*
<Butt3rfly>	lol
<Audioburn_work>	camelCaseSavesLives
<Scourjee>	Scientology is a lie
<treefiddy_>	thisIsTrueCamelCaseUberAlles
<Symantic>	i was thinking of going to the Roswell festival but then i thought people might be upset with me if im not being a good human ambassador while tripping on acid.
<CHVNX>	Thetan is a spirit. Your body is not you. You are a thetan.  Your body is constantly attacked by other thetans.  Body thetans, to be exact. In Dianetics, you are trying to rid the body of these negative thetans, so that your own thetan can be "cleared" of its reactive mind.
<CHVNX>	In other words: Scientology.
<Symantic>	schizo people (along with fat bottom girls) make the world do something [awful]
<Time-Warp>	treefiddy_, Symantic, CHVNX, Scourjee, Audioburn_work: http://geekshumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/vlc-media-player.jpg
<treefiddy_>	Time-Warp: (_*_)
<CHVNX>	Time-Warp: le lel
<Scourjee>	I'm being hit by massive DEW right now
<Time-Warp>	ROFLMFLMFAO
<Symantic>	lol.
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<Scourjee>	It's even creating a physical reaction
<Symantic>	Scourjee: i get hit by massive dew in the shower everyday. youll be alright
<Audioburn_work>	Time-Warp, lol, boop
<Scourjee>	Directed Energy Weaponry
<Scourjee>	F you bro, I live this every day
<Time-Warp>	LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Scourjee>	I'm soaked from walking through the rain.  I am dedicated because I am not selfish
<Audioburn_work>	CHVNX, is this guy serious?
<Symantic>	Scourjee: nobody cares enough about you to attack you. just remember that your insignificant and not special and youll start feeling alot better.
<Audioburn_work>	I'm hoping he is a troll
<Symantic>	he a troll.
<Audioburn_work>	ok good
<Symantic>	or a morning drinker
<CHVNX>	Audioburn_work: Scourjee is very serious, sadly.
<Oddity>	As serious as a prodromal psychotic episode.
<Scourjee>	I love you satan.  But I will not worship you.  When I say I believe in God, I belive in an energy.
<CHVNX>	Symantic: I've read parts of his upcoming book.  He is not a troll, he is sick.
<Audioburn_work>	lol, dafuq
<Scourjee>	Well, I don't love what satan does, but he is a creation of the God almighty, and he serves a purpose.
<Audioburn_work>	damn
<CHVNX>	Smoke crack and worship satan.
<Audioburn_work>	this is kinda sad
<CHVNX>	Poseurs.
<Audioburn_work>	probably because he is unable to listen to people
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<treefiddy_>	serves to be the bad guy in an epic story about a being who creates an entire universe, yet tells you not to masturbate.
<Time-Warp>	dude crack heads have issues
<Symantic>	its kinda interesting looking at the opposite spectrum of genius.
<Time-Warp>	omg
<CHVNX>	Audioburn_work: Anyone opposed to his ideas is compromised.
<Audioburn_work>	jesus
<Scourjee>	onbeyondtime.blogspot.com That is my blog
<Symantic>	who is going to kam yap this year????
<Symantic>	gonna be crazy
<Scourjee>	I haven't been posting there that frequently though
<treefiddy_>	kam yap? or cam fap?
<Symantic>	i made it up anyway
<Audioburn_work>	dafuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuq
<Scourjee>	I'm being hit really hard right now.  I'm not sure how much longer I can stay
<Oddity>	cam fap on kam yap
<Audioburn_work>	did you take some bad lsd?
<rosenberg>	Scourjee: sweet
<Symantic>	Scourjee: i recommend you rip your clothes off (they exponentiate the energy), then run outside.... someone will be around soon to assist you with life.
<rosenberg>	i dont understand this
<Scourjee>	You are a shill Symantic
<Symantic>	fk you
<Scourjee>	I'm trying to help all of you
<Symantic>	fk off
<Scourjee>	You can be freed with enough information saturation.
<rosenberg>	sounds like a combination of NLP, conspiracy theories and mental illness
<Audioburn_work>	Scourjee, we're trying to help you bro.
<CHVNX>	Scourjee: The safest place for you is at a mental health facility, under the care of professionals.  Or, your local Scientology centre.
<princefakhan_>	I need a captain. what the fvck is going on here.
<Symantic>	true, Scourjee you can rant crazy shit but you cant make me unthink!
<CHVNX>	Symantic as unthunk.
<Scourjee>	There is a scientology church in my town
<Audioburn_work>	Scourjee, when you get some scientific proof for your ideas then you'll be onto something.
<Scourjee>	It is abandoned though.
<Symantic>	your information needs to reach me, your simply batshit fkn crazy so anything you say i wont absorb.
<hmir>	This 'cvonversation' is schizophrenic.
<Audioburn_work>	But you are delusional for now, Scourjee
<Audioburn_work>	literally
<sud0>	penis
<Audioburn_work>	you aren't making any sense
*	hmir slaps sud0 upside down with a small whale
<Scourjee>	I live in a fking tent now
<hmir>	You watch yo mouth!
*	Time-Warp cuddles hmir
<sud0>	:(
<Symantic>	Scourjee: i worship the devil and i talk to him in my coffee every morning.
<Symantic>	so leave me alone
*	hmir hugs Time-Warp
<CHVNX>	Scourjee: Seriously, go talk to them.  No jokes. Tell them about your theories,a nd then ask how that relates to Scientology. They HATE psychology and psychotherapy, so you have a friend with Sceintology.  Pro tip: leave your wallet at home.
<SimenOlai>	I talk to god everyday
<SimenOlai>	I am god
<SimenOlai>	I talk to myself
<rosenberg>	Beyond Time. Originally, in 2014 I met somebody from the Deep Web who told as many people about Beyond Time as they could.
<Scourjee>	I don't have a wallet
<Symantic>	Scourjee: go worship SimenOlai
<rosenberg>	Scourjee: you need to get off Tor
<rosenberg>	good god man
<Time-Warp>	SUD0!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Audioburn_work>	>mcdonalds
<Audioburn_work>	>starbucks
<SimenOlai>	exactly what I was thinking
<CHVNX>	Scourjee: Are you familiar with Time Cube theory?
<rosenberg>	Scourjee uses Sparrow OS
<Symantic>	where the homeless people get their wifi on smart phones
<Scourjee>	Those are all part of the suppresion campaign
<SimenOlai>	lo
<SimenOlai>	lol
<Scourjee>	CHVNX:  Yes
<Oddity>	Scourjee, is the singularity near?
<rosenberg>	he uses Kali too when hacking wifi networks
<Scourjee>	Another shill told me about it
<Time-Warp>	rosenberg: shhhh
<rosenberg>	busted :)
<Scourjee>	I want to remove myself from the physical dimension
<CHVNX>	Scourjee: Please define shill, and then prove *you* are not a shill.
<Symantic>	Scourjee: the devil told me you are a shill, my coffee said it right now
<treefiddy_>	I am the architect. it is time for you to rejoin the collective. just stare at the screen and don't mind the flashing
<Audioburn_work>	CHVNX, looool
<Scourjee>	I want to lock myself into the other side
<rosenberg>	;-)
<Symantic>	Scourjee: mental institutions are a good place to start with locking yourself into
<Scourjee>	My greatest fear is that I'm actually compromised
<Audioburn_work>	Scourjee, WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CONTACT YOU. WAKE UP. WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME
<CHVNX>	Scourjee is a disinformation agent, trying to distract your from reality.
<Scourjee>	That's what I'm afraid of man
<crimlo>	I am Satan's son
<crimlo>	who want some?
<Symantic>	crimlo: sup dad
<Scourjee>	The only solution is remove
<Scourjee>	Myself from this planet
<treefiddy_>	im going to send you a series of images
<crimlo>	Symantic hi son

<crimlo>	really?
<crimlo>	wow
<rosenberg>	i saw him on that roast thing and he looked like a 90s lesbian
<crimlo>	how was the roast?
<Oddity>	Well he is a 90's lesbian
<Symantic>	roast sucked
<rosenberg>	yeah
<crimlo>	more like a 90s fag
<Oddity>	ok I agree with crimlo
<rosenberg>	hehehe
<Symantic>	the roast was just sad lol.
<crimlo>	awww
<crimlo>	i was going to youtube it
<Oddity>	I didn't watch it because I don't want to see that kid for a second longer than I have to
<rosenberg>	same here, Oddity
<crimlo>	i swear i have yet to hear a song justin sang
<crimlo>	why is he famous
<Oddity>	Disney
<Symantic>	crimlo: cause he will do whatever it takes
<crimlo>	i guess
<Symantic>	crimlo: the fker didn't just happen to make a youtube video and land on a concert stage soon after
<crimlo>	oh
<crimlo>	i know him by hearing others talk about him
<Symantic>	i hate the kid, truly... but still not a reason to disengage what you can learn from it.
<crimlo>	hate?
<Symantic>	he spits on people.
<crimlo>	hahahah foreal?
<crimlo>	see i like him now
<rosenberg>	he's arrogant
<Oddity>	Insane Clown Posse should beat the piss out of him
<crimlo>	dirty bastards
<Symantic>	well, to be fair the little girls want to be spit on. its all fked
<Symantic>	but, don't make it right
<crimlo>	if they'll allow it its right damnit
<Symantic>	i unno, ive started to realize i hate kids.
<irreverant>	does anyone know if verizon is gsm or cdma?
<Oddity>	huh-what?
<sheep>	irreverant: CDMA with LTE
<Symantic>	im at that age where they are simply nothing but a damn pain in the ass.
<sheep>	source: I have a verizon phone
<Oddity>	That's any adult age :)
<irreverant>	ah ok
<sheep>	some phones sold through verizon support GSM and CDMA
<irreverant>	sheep: thankx; cause i saw a chip port on my phone but no sim
<irreverant>	yeah world phones
<sheep>	CDMA phones can use SIM cards.  I'm pretty sure a SIM card is needed for LTE
<sheep>	are you sure that slot isn't for a microSD card?
<Symantic>	for example, i was streaming the mayweather fight live, was laggy so i paused it for 20 minutes, went and got some food and came back... fight was over and neighbor kid runs out to my car and says stuff. i plug my ears and start yelling "SHUUUSH, i havent seen the fight SHUUUUUUUUUUUSH".... i start walking away and she starts yelling "mayweather won"
<Symantic>	i almost hit a child
<Scourjee>	I feel a little bit safer now, not totally safe
<Scourjee>	Still shaking a bit
*	Time-Warp eats sheep
<Symantic>	thats one example of 100000000 reasons kids are a nuisance.
<Symantic>	I don't consider kids people. they are biological beings too dumb to interact as real people.
<Symantic>	no sense.
<Symantic>	need leashes and muzzles and whatnot
<irreverant>	sheep yeah i thought it was needed for LTE but i don't have a Sim which is what confused me
<Time-Warp>	think we need to get rid of all old people
<sheep>	what kind of phone is it?
<Oddity>	Time-Warp, affirmative
<Time-Warp>	ants do the same. ands give all the old ants jobs like takeing out the garbage
<Time-Warp>	ants *
*	princefakhan_ is now known as princefakhan
<Symantic>	old people are cool, as long as a biological body contains a brain its all i can ask for.
<Scourjee>	CHVNX:
<Time-Warp>	lol jk
<Time-Warp>	Symantic: theres nothing wrong with old people. but some old people smoke crack
<Symantic>	so?

<Time-Warp>	<_<
<Symantic>	Its only when a mosquito lands on your testicles do you realize you can solve problems without violence
<crimlo>	is there such a thing?
<sud0>	#haskell is always empty you should try there, Scourjee
<princefakhan>	hell no way
<princefakhan>	lol symantic
<crimlo>	Symantic you just added something to my bucket-list
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<crimlo>	i seriously want a mosquito to suck blood from my balls

<crimlo>	treefiddy_ wrong
<treefiddy_>	sup warpspeed
<Symantic>	princefakhan: so what if i waz?
<princefakhan>	treefiddy_ that is contradictory
<Scourjee>	Of all the races in this universe, humans are the only ones that have any sense of 'free will'
<treefiddy_>	crimlo: what does a billion years mean to a piece of rock?
<treefiddy_>	not a damn thing
<princefakhan>	symantic: nothing. u just got a bj.
<crimlo>	Scourjee dumbest thing you'd said thus far
<CHVNX>	treefiddy_: And yet, in a billion years, that rock might not exist.
<crimlo>	what do you know of the universe
<crimlo>	you
<checkmatein1>	beanie
<crimlo>	you're a dot on a dot talking ish
<Time-Warp>	CHVNX: true depends if its erodeing in water etc
<CHVNX>	Or swallowed by it's host star.
<CHVNX>	Or radioactive decay.
<CHVNX>	...
<Scourjee>	crimlo:
<Scourjee>	I've been over to the other side
<crimlo>	yes?
<Time-Warp>	gama rays dont effect rocks though
<CHVNX>	Scourjee: Other side of what?
<Time-Warp>	but they do effect metal
<crimlo>	dude you're just a man who's going through some sort of emotions
<Time-Warp>	you can make metal radioactive
<crimlo>	being alive allows you to say whatever you want
<Mav-Laptop>	earwigs
<crimlo>	in due time that will be fixed
<Scourjee>	CHVNX: The Other Side
<CHVNX>	Scourjee: So, which is it - the other side, or one of the other sides? You claim to believe in three dimensions of existence, not to be confused with the real dinebsions of reality.
<Time-Warp>	Mav-Laptop: radioactive earwigs?
<Mav-Laptop>	billions of them :O
<treefiddy_>	we were born. born. born. born to be alive.
<crimlo>	the other side = his grandmother's house
<Time-Warp>	LO

<CHVNX>	Scourjee: If you're going to be insane, at least be consistant.
<Mav-Laptop>	<3
<Scourjee>	What?

<Konnor[3ZD]>	http://www.twitch.tv/LuminousGamerz

<crimlo>	oh
<Konnor[3ZD]>	i decided to ad http://www.twitch.tv/LuminousGamerz
<Scourjee>	Physical world, The Other Side, and the Energy Dimension
<crimlo>	there are countless dimensions
<bazhang>	joni mitchell
<crimlo>	dude not that kind of dimension
<crimlo>	you are talking fairytail stuff
<jenni>	crimlo, How's existence
<crimlo>	we're talking about layers within time itself

<Time-Warp>	Scourjee: and crimlo sitting in a tree first comes love then comes ...
<bazhang>	Scourjee, plans a very short channel stay
<Scourjee>	I'm trying to help you
<bazhang>	I predict less than five seconds remain
<Scourjee>	What
<crimlo>	Time-Warp "followed by a push and Scourjee breaks his neck"
<crimlo>	:)
<bazhang>	time to say bye bye Scourjee
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<Time-Warp>	oh snap
<crimlo>	awww dont ban him
<Scourjee>	You've banned me many times
<Scourjee>	I want to remove myself from this planet.
<crimlo>	then buy a gun bro
<CHVNX>	Bullets work. Your belt doubles as rope.
<Time-Warp>	does anyone know who made the song with the lryics
<Time-Warp>	avalanche bring it down
<Time-Warp>	lol
<Time-Warp>	its a chick
<CHVNX>	I'm sure you live near a tall building/bridge.
<Scourjee>	I have my belt for that
<treefiddy_>	Time-Warp: it's called Landslide - stevie nicks
<Scourjee>	I'm scared of heights, I cant will myself to jump if I had to
<CHVNX>	Fleetwood Mac – Landslide.

<CHVNX>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM7-PYtXtJM
<Scourjee>	My only hope is that you have all made peace.
<Time-Warp>	ErrantEgo: leggo my ego
<CHVNX>	Scourjee: There is no peace to make.  Peace is an illusion, a reaction to violence.  The nature of the universe is pure violence. Chaos.  Order without form, without reason.
<Butt3rfly>	entropy
<Scourjee>	The capability to detonate the entire planet is available to everyone & more, and can be expedited through information saturation.
<CHVNX>	Peace is an illusion, a lie you tell to yourself.  To make peace with yourself is to lie to yourself. Embrace your inner chaos. Let it roam free. Hate what you hate, and fucking hate it with passion.
<Symantic>	everything has reason, doesnt mean its planned though
<crimlo>	CHVNX true & false
<Symantic>	"why did the meteor hit" | ANSWER : Gravity
<crimlo>	life is the collective of chaos and peace
<crimlo>	its not one or the other
<Symantic>	no, life is a serious of cool moments that happend that one time.
<Scourjee>	No
<Symantic>	and to plan on making more of those same experiences in hte future
<crimlo>	wrong
<CHVNX>	##philosophy
<Scourjee>	The Other Side is a collection of events
<crimlo>	life is everything that is.

<Konnor[3ZD]>	i dont mknow http://www.twitch.tv/LuminousGamerz

<treefiddy_>	sud0: because of your host
<crimlo>	i once found philosphy interesting then i realized life is a tangible experience... screw thinking.. live
<crimlo>	why should an ant be bothered with mars?
<rosenberg>	sud0: people on freenode ban for no reason
<princefakhan>	crimlo: then u joined irc
<bazhang>	rush hour traffic requires thought
<sheep>	rosenberg: people on IRC ban for no reason
<sheep>	it looks like a very recent ban though
<rosenberg>	i got banned from etc
<rosenberg>	i only went in there once
<crimlo>	agreed, mods are usually on a power trip
<sheep>	ops
<rosenberg>	and someone asked me how i found out about the channel and i said it was on the channel list
<rosenberg>	and they banned me
<sheep>	IRC doesn't usually call them mods
<sud0>	glad for humanity not everybody thinks like you, crimlo
<sheep>	oh wow
<Scourjee>	bazhang: I haven't been able to get on irc recently
<sheep>	that seems petty

<Scourjee>	Yes, I wish I had a van
<treefiddy_>	in a van, down by the river
<sud0>	awww, treefiddy_
<bazhang>	hopefully you have good intentions
<crimlo>	"i love not human the less but nature the more"
<sud0>	I imagine treefiddy_ wearing his public m#sturbator jacket

<bazhang>	sud0, cut it out
<treefiddy_>	I'm matt foley. I'm 35, and i live in a van, down by the river
<sud0>	sorry, bazhang
<checkmatein1>	ah dear why does my crush keep moving tables in maths

<crimlo>	almost as cool as living next to the ocean

<treefiddy_>	it's quieter
<crimlo>	advice "do not shit in  teh water"
<treefiddy_>	no pesky waves crashing all night
<shatterer123>	i think treefiddy might be trollin' ?
<treefiddy_>	shatterer123: it's a very famous SNL skit
<sud0>	random question: I recently bought a telescope. Can I take pictures with my regular camera using some kind of selfmade adapter?
<shatterer123>	treefiddy_ yeah
<tallguy>	I live next to the ocean, the sounds are soothing, not discordant
<princefakhan>	I'm not here for long.

<princefakhan>	then realized they don't have a women to screw their life
<bazhang>	princefakhan, people are
<crimlo>	princefakhan thats because they are usually filled with life ( sperms)
<bazhang>	princefakhan, time to grab a clue, that road wont end well

<StarHorder>	no it isnt
<grayC>	sorry irreverant
<mchelen1>	grayC: it already is in many places :(
<irreverant>	70k a year which is like 2692 a check

<AdNauseaum2>	i dont eat much anymore i eat packs of ramen
<AdNauseaum2>	cant get hot water for it either
<grayC>	for $1.50 you can buy a packet of dried mung beans
<bazhang>	sure
<CustosLimen>	irreverant, maybe you can charge people to idle in their channels then nobody has to type out irreverant and they can just use name completion for it ;)
<StarHorder>	no food bank in your area?
<grayC>	with water thats 9 meals
<bazhang>	yet you have the time for irc, and net connection
<grayC>	so your noodles are $1 a meal

<mchelen1>	AdNauseaum2: have you looked into welfare, assisted housing programs, etc?
<grayC>	switch to mung beans
<irreverant>	bazhang, are you referring to me?
<AdNauseaum2>	bazhang: library

<bazhang>	where is that
<bunbasket>	how do hacker groups like the lizard squad get enough bandwidth to take down Sony PSN, Xbox Live, and hack steam
<AdNauseaum2>	nevada
<grayC>	"poor" people waste money on stupid stuff
<mchelen1>	grayC: its a shame they dont sell phones where you live
<CustosLimen>	bunbasket, botnets ?
<grayC>	i dont want a phone
<bazhang>	nevada from where
<AdNauseaum2>	that's none of your business
<treefiddy_>	a turkish prison
<mchelen1>	grayC: then you really shouldn't complain if someone else has a phone
<bazhang>	its ajkthx
<CustosLimen>	bunbasket, we farm botnets at work - we have a strict no update policy cos nobody can be bothered, almost every computer where I work is on the internet and has multiple serious vulnerabilities
<mchelen1>	AdNauseaum2: do you have a friend you can stay with?
<bazhang>	thats all I need to know
<grayC>	they bought it bazhang
<bunbasket>	no but how to people create large botnets by hacking computers if a) it's so hard to hack now, no publicly available exploits, and b) web sites, DDoS targets, and other servers have so much bandwidth, that a puny DSL or cable upstream even with 100,000s of bots isn't going to do anything?
<bazhang>	hook line and sinker
<grayC>	just buy botnet
<CustosLimen>	bunbasket, you spray and pray
<grayC>	^
<bunbasket>	i mean, I personally don't want to this (I don't even hack/crack/whatever), but I'm curious becaus eI see things happening and I thought there was much protection against that stuff now
<grayC>	lizard swuad arent hackers they are fame whores
<mchelen1>	bunbasket: who says there are no publicly available exploits?
<bunbasket>	oh they bought the botnet
<bunbasket>	makes sense
<grayC>	yea
<treefiddy_>	bunbasket: they mess with the packets. a simple 64k icmp packet becomes much much larger
<CustosLimen>	bunbasket, hacking a specific target is not easy, hacking any vulerable computer is easier - if you scan 1000s of IPs for vulerabilities then you are more likely to get one
<AdNauseaum2>	the thing is i spent all my money on medical bills because i have terminal autism
<bunbasket>	i do, whenever you go online, and hear something new comes out like heartbleed, there's no working exploit available to make it work
<FauxReal>	i used to work for att cdn serivice.. the biggest ddos i saw was 275Gbp/sec
<AdNauseaum2>	so now im broke
<FauxReal>	it impressed me
<bunbasket>	i mean i'm not expert, i'm just saying what I see when i search for this stuff
<bunbasket>	holy toledo!
<grayC>	LS are skid fame whorea
<sunstar>	so leave it to the experts
<bazhang>	i have terminal autism
<bunbasket>	oh
<bazhang>	oookay then
<AdNauseaum2>	oh you have this condition too?
<mchelen1>	bunbasket: there were heartbleed POC
<bunbasket>	In Lizard Squad's first rap song, hey said they didn't accept sc's
<AdNauseaum2>	i found that going gluten free helped my terminal autism greatly
<mchelen1>	i bet there are heartbleed vuln comps running right now
<grayC>	you should foreget about them
<bazhang>	AdNauseaum2, time to stop is now
<AdNauseaum2>	uh oh, gonna ban me again
<CustosLimen>	bunbasket, when I was making botnets I mainly relied on bad passwords, had a list of about 200 passwords, got dozens of boxes, and I was after very specific targets
<bazhang>	got it in one
<AdNauseaum2>	flex them e-muscles bazhang
<FauxReal>	most openvpn are still vurnable to heart bleed
<bunbasket>	another good question i have: is using proxies illegal?
<sunstar>	yeah bunbasket is blowing smoke
<AdNauseaum2>	so powerful, i bow before you
<grayC>	no it isnt illegal
<bunbasket>	like right now i'm  using a proxy
<CustosLimen>	bunbasket, depends on country
<bunbasket>	oh
<bunbasket>	it's usa
<CustosLimen>	bunbasket, then I think no
<AdNauseaum2>	bazhang, the powertripping irc shitlord
<bunbasket>	like if you go on the web, and see port 8080 proxy listed on http://xroxy.com, it's not illegal
<AdNauseaum2>	good luck finding a proxy that works on freenode
<AdNauseaum2>	i have to go through like 100 just to connect
<CustosLimen>	bunbasket, well - that is slightly different issue, but I don't think anybody can charge you with it. It might however be a proxy on a box that was hacked
<AdNauseaum2>	the struggles of k-line evasion
<dw1>	such rebel
<CustosLimen>	AdNauseaum2, don't get k-lined ?
<dw1>	e-rebel
<dw1>	lol
<FauxReal>	hehe
<grayC>	you should wait it out otherwise you will always have to ban evade
<treefiddy_>	lmao wtf? hahahaha
<AdNauseaum2>	that'd be optimal
<dw1>	alright time to get baked and do work
<AdNauseaum2>	nah i just ban evade once, admins on freenode kline for like 2 weeks
<grayC>	thx dw1
<AdNauseaum2>	i can even login to the same account and they do nothing
<grayC>	wondered when it was that time
<AdNauseaum2>	they seem to not care about evasion
<CustosLimen>	AdNauseaum2, don't get banned ?
*	kline wallops AdNauseaum2 
<CustosLimen>	AdNauseaum2, and don't ban evade !?

<CustosLimen>	AdNauseaum2, how is this so hard ?
<grayC>	sick
<CustosLimen>	AdNauseaum2, its not like this is efnet
<AdNauseaum2>	its a hard life spamming racial slurs when your terminal autism kicks in
<AdNauseaum2>	admins apparently dont like racial slurs
<AdNauseaum2>	it is what it is
<grayC>	kill yourself.
<AdNauseaum2>	the struggles
<AdNauseaum2>	the trials and tribulations
<AdNauseaum2>	of the internet relay chat

<irreverant>	why do you guys think we compare our achievements to others
<irreverant>	when i was young i didn't care about what my cousins or family/friends accomplished because I was always under the philosophy of run your own race;
<irreverant>	the game between the tortoise and the hare; to always be the tortoise
<bazhang>	without darkness there can be no light, thats why
<irreverant>	lately i have been thinking that way
<irreverant>	i actually told someone how would recognize light if there was no darkness
<grayC>	it is useless to compare yourself to others
<grayC>	useless
<irreverant>	as i'm getting older i'm starting to compare my life to others and it's negatively impacting my attitude;
<bazhang>	use less enter is useful
<irreverant>	it's like a illness i fear i'm losing control to is.

<grayC>	it is still not chocolate
<irreverant>	grayC, i agree; you do start to become vain and bitter; but at the same time
<bazhang>	but your insides will be oh so tan
<irreverant>	i just want to improve my life; the quality of life and those things in my life
<grayC>	read the desirada irreverant
<bazhang>	and so tan is one step from satan
<grayC>	yes but you dont need a compre for that
<irreverant>	without aspiration we stagnate
<bazhang>	thus completely the step from light to darkness
<grayC>	i try and improve myself every day
<grayC>	do good things
<irreverant>	is that a poem?
<grayC>	desirada? yes
<bazhang>	rome was improved in a day
<grayC>	go placidly amid the noise and haste and remeber what peace there may be in silence etc

<dw1>	nah, 'estimated delivery date'
<hsr>	strange
<dw1>	nearly always comes the same day estimated
<hsr>	they do that in India though
<dw1>	so shipped a couple days before

<treefiddy_>	the data doesn't always get sent to the server properly

<treefiddy_>	so it may have been shipped. if they didn't do their end of day, no data sent

<milkmaid>	Ugh
<milkmaid>	Organ
<bazhang>	try /topic

<jjs999jjs>	there she goes
<grayC>	new obsession Rory
<jjs999jjs>	by the La's
<bazhang>	Rory, you from snoonet
<Rory>	bazhang: yes and no
<bazhang>	Rory, part of the raiding party
<jjs999jjs>	guess my answer was wrong :(
<grobend>	Rory - Darude - Sandstorm
<Rory>	bazhang: Yes I'm "from snoonet" in that I am connected there. AFAIK my warning of a raiding party was unwarranted
<Phospher>	hello swift110-phone
<speagle>	rory: lots of songs have "la la la la" in them
<Rory>	bazhang: As it happens I was on Freenode before Snoonet existed (and will continue to be here after it dies)
<grobend>	Samesies!
<Rory>	speagle: I know, I was wanting to see what the first one that came to people's mind was
<bazhang>	reddit?
<jjs999jjs>	whats Snoonet ?
<grayC>	well i took a trip to outback australia last week to see what the people thought of the indian super mine speagle , that was quite interesting
<speagle>	ok
<Rory>	Snoonet is an IRC network for subreddits to have their official IRC channels.
<speagle>	snoonets another IRC network probably
<jjs999jjs>	oh right
<jjs999jjs>	I best shut up now then
<speagle>	cool grayC
<jjs999jjs>	got b anned for chatting before
<jjs999jjs>	laterz
<bazhang>	they take reddit so we dont have to
<speagle>	lol jjs999jjs
<Encapsulation>	nag champion
<speagle>	reddit bores me if I'm honest
<Rory>	pretty much bazhang though you've still got #reddit-mlp so I guess it averages out
<speagle>	twitter is more interesting, more news to read
<Encapsulation>	speagle, so be dishonest
<Encapsulation>	then you won't be bored =D
<jjs999jjs>	ah twitter I CAN DO
<bazhang>	if we can only convince snoonet to take all the altcoin channels
<jjs999jjs>	and with an election coming up....
<speagle>	I'm voting for the blue people
<speagle>	because blue is the best colour
<grayC>	i cant cope with twitter
<jjs999jjs>	blue is the colour football is the game......
<jjs999jjs>	great song
<jjs999jjs>	grayC catch up to the 21st century
<jjs999jjs>	type faster harder longer
<speagle>	twitter is great especially during a live developer event or an announcement
<grayC>	lol
<speagle>	loads of people try to get SEO by tweeting every 10 seconds about the stuff being said
<jjs999jjs>	OR during an election
<bazhang>	twitter is full on outsourcing of all brain functions
<grayC>	i just got it to do that mass reporting jihad script
<jjs999jjs>	I WILL be live for sure on thursday
<pingfloyd>	I'll trade you Illinois Avenue for 100 bitcoins
<grayC>	but now its all full of stuff idk
<jjs999jjs>	twitter is real poeple doing what they are allowed to do ie chatter away I mean twitter away
<grayC>	i think i will unsubscribe to it now
<speagle>	in all truth I cant vote because I'm only 17
<speagle>	and I wouldnt vote if I could because I'm not walking all the way to a polling station
<jjs999jjs>	every speagle is a wannabe eagle
<bazhang>	tweets: where ideas go to die
<speagle>	when I could be at home watching TV lol
<pingfloyd>	speagle: problem with voting is it is like choosing between dumb and dumber
<pingfloyd>	and it's not very clear who dumber is
<jjs999jjs>	to those who are clueless
<AnTi_MTtr>	lol@matt berry's guest starring episode of community
<AnTi_MTtr>	great plot
<grayC>	that is so true bazhang , people write stuff on twitter and that is the end of it
<speagle>	matt berry what a legend
<bazhang>	ikr
<MINIMAN10000>	Well jeeze that's weird. Tera said it would be released on steam but the only things i see on the page are DLC packs and no game download.
<speagle>	douglas reynholm
<speagle>	best character from IT crowd
<bazhang>	and it gets followed into the abyss
<speagle>	I should go and watch that right now actually
*	jjs999jjs is in with the in crowd
<speagle>	why did it have to end :(
*	jjs999jjs goes where the in crowd goes
<jjs999jjs>	great song
<speagle>	btw anyone in here a web developer?
<grayC>	yea that "follow" feature is creepy, idk who is follwoing me
<speagle>	ever heard of a website called browserstack.com, its really good
<bazhang>	might as well read stalk
<grayC>	and i dont want to follow anyone geez
<pingfloyd>	isn't everyone and their brother a web developer?
<grayC>	yea!
<speagle>	you can test websites in browsers across all operating systems, like IE6 and stuff so you dont need to use a VM
<jjs999jjs>	I still tweet :)
<speagle>	and the best bit is its anonymous as well
<jjs999jjs>	I dont have bitcoin or altcoin or aldicoin or asdacoin or anycoin
<bazhang>	you can play the original doom in a browser these days
<pingfloyd>	looks like it costs money though
<pingfloyd>	aside from a free trial
<pingfloyd>	might as well DIY unless you're a business
<speagle>	in all truth anyone using IE6-10 in 2015 is an idiot, excuse my french
<speagle>	even IE11 is pretty bad
<comma8_>	IE8 is the only approved browser in a lot of organizations
<pingfloyd>	in a business setting the cost of doing it that way is a savings in time which amounts to even more money.
<pingfloyd>	s/IE11/IE
<speagle>	lol only approved browser
<jjs999jjs>	even I wont use ie
<jjs999jjs>	btw whats ie ?
<speagle>	ever heard of tor? or just chrome on a memory stick
<jjs999jjs>	is ie free ?
<pingfloyd>	the only intelligent choice is firefox and maybe opera
<jjs999jjs>	oh opera I haz
<comma8_>	speagle, the pleb users are not allowed to run arbitrary apps
<grobend>	Why the fuck would you want IE
<speagle>	lol
<jjs999jjs>	is ie free ?
<speagle>	grobend: because the E, well thats the button for the internet roy
<jjs999jjs>	cos I haz room for it
<speagle>	the BUTTON for the the internet? jesus christ...

<AnTi_MTtr>	are you really an alchoholic if you dont get physical withdrawals from quitting?
<grayC>	yea
<grayC>	alot of people get DT's and stuff from low blood sugar associated with alcohol consumption
<jjs999jjs>	alcohol is frowned upon in here
<Butt3rfly>	is it now?
<jjs999jjs>	I got accused of being an alcoholic
<grayC>	there arent really any physical symptoms of alcolism
<Butt3rfly>	so did I
<jjs999jjs>	yet I never ever drink midweek due to my working
<jjs999jjs>	but hey ho no apology was ever issued
<Butt3rfly>	I said ,,!,,
<AnTi_MTtr>	what are DT's?
<jjs999jjs>	grayC,  spell it right man
<Butt3rfly>	I sometimes drink midweek
<AnTi_MTtr>	grayC: yeah but you can certianly have withdrawal symptoms from alchoholism
<AnTi_MTtr>	i know one of them is a lowered seisrue threshold
<Butt3rfly>	I don't think anyone in here is in any place to judge
<grayC>	yea
<jjs999jjs>	some seem to think they are
<jjs999jjs>	as my experience proved
<Butt3rfly>	some people just don't get addicted to alcohol, I seem to be one of them
<grayC>	living with a real alcoholic is a good way to stymie any ambitions you may have of becoming one
<Butt3rfly>	yes
<grayC>	alcohol comes first with them
<y0wza>	u wanna get drunk
<AnTi_MTtr>	Butt3rfly: well i dont drink liquor, but ive been a 3-6 beer a day drinker for years
<y0wza>	lets go look see what they got
<AnTi_MTtr>	and im almost 10 days on the wagon 0 symptoms
<treefiddy_>	if you're stealing bottles of nail polish remover and filtering it through a peice of bread and drinking it, you'er probably an alcoholic
<grayC>	or hiding the drink containers when they are empty
<AnTi_MTtr>	i dont hide them
<grayC>	or running LPG thru milk
<AnTi_MTtr>	i recap them put htem back in their original packaging, stack em up till they fill the recycle bin and toss em
<treefiddy_>	AnTi_MTtr: the CDC has released new data on the subject. they say 2/3 adults is a heavy drinker, but 90% of those do NOT have an alcohol dependency
<Butt3rfly>	AnTi_MTtr, I drank everyday for a few years when my mum had cancer, but I stopped with no problem either
<grayC>	whats your mrs after you to quit or somthing AnTi_MTtr ?
<y0wza>	were u guys drinkin a lot or somethin
<Butt3rfly>	just beer too
<AnTi_MTtr>	grayC: no i just stopped  cuz it was giving me pancreatitis
<AnTi_MTtr>	and thats no good
<grayC>	not good at all
<AnTi_MTtr>	fortuantely highly avoidable
<treefiddy_>	bah, you dont need a pancreas
<AnTi_MTtr>	all ihave to do is stop drinking
<grayC>	you can get some good herbal support for that
<y0wza>	lol
<grayC>	have some dandelion root
<y0wza>	or jus goto subway get italian herbs n cheese bred
<AnTi_MTtr>	grayC: well thats just it, since i stopped drinking no pacreatitis
<AnTi_MTtr>	so i dunno
<grayC>	yea give it a rest
<AnTi_MTtr>	i think my pancreas is ok still just needed to ease up
<grayC>	have some weed or somthing
<AnTi_MTtr>	oh i did that anways :P
<AnTi_MTtr>	and still enjoying that
<grayC>	thats good
<Butt3rfly>	when you drink every day, you don't enjoy it as much imo
<AnTi_MTtr>	i enjoyed it but i do know that i REALLY enjoy it after a long break
<AnTi_MTtr>	 i also find i cant drink nearly as much
<AnTi_MTtr>	it just wastes me
<grayC>	i used to enjoy drinking sometimes before i lived with an alcoholic
<AnTi_MTtr>	oh yeah
<grayC>	now i only drink in emergencies
<Butt3rfly>	I grew up in a family of alcoholics that owned a pub
<grayC>	crikey
<Butt3rfly>	funny how it never got me like it did them, like I said, somepeople just seem to be immune to the addiction
<grayC>	i made a new freind recently right, i go and see him at his house and he sort of flirts with me
<grayC>	well last time i went he told me he is a "naturalist" at home and that i shouldnt expect him to be wearing clothes next time i visit
<grayC>	do you think that is fair?
<x2f>	as an arab
<x2f>	i prove to people that i'm not muslim by drawing muhammed
<x2f>	could also just drink beer but that's not always possible
<grayC>	he inferred i should also take my clothes off to visit with him
<milkmaid>	Mohammed was a pedo
<jjs999jjs>	perhaps she was but so what
<grayC>	i cant work out if he is for real or just trying to f me
<Butt3rfly>	why don't you just ask him?

<artwoodwork>	they are all in their 70s
<grayC>	wow
<vdamewood>	It seems they haven't gather'd any moss.
<jjs999jjs>	not a bad IQ tbh
<EjaculatingGirl>	:3
<vdamewood>	gathered, I mean.
<jjs999jjs>	but they are all in their late 160 IQ
<irreverant>	lets be honest; Giorgio and Daft Punk sounds sooo similar
<AnTi_MTtr>	i love that track
<AnTi_MTtr>	the whole album is good though
<Romance>	i thought i was the only kind person in this neighborhood, there are other people feeding stray cats and dogs in here
<AnTi_MTtr>	do you let them live in your house Romance?
<Romance>	no , i have enough cats in my house
<Romance>	they are stray cats. maybe someone else cats
<AnTi_MTtr>	how many cats do you have?
<Romance>	at the moment 13
<AnTi_MTtr>	thats an unlucky number
<treefiddy_>	holy shit
<Romance>	of course, i need to spend $100/month just for their food
<AnTi_MTtr>	oh yeah, no doubt
<AnTi_MTtr>	how much on litter?
<Romance>	they pee and poo in toilet, i teach them
<Romance>	clever cats
<Romance>	i just need to wash em with water
<AnTi_MTtr>	so they dont flush yet?
<Romance>	but mom keep bragging to send them all to grandpa's house, maybe few weeks more
<Romance>	uh no
<AnTi_MTtr>	thatd be a good trick
<AnTi_MTtr>	they have the paws for it atleast
<Romance>	theres this male cat, he likes to smell my armpit and sleep close to it. i think hes gay
<irreverant>	The girls are like a shadow, if you fall them they flee; but if you flee, they follow you.
<adsjlkdk>	a
<adsjlkdk>	can you guys hear me
<treefiddy_>	no
<treefiddy_>	we can see you type though
<EjaculatingGirl>	irreverant and a boob feels like a bag of sand too right?
<treefiddy_>	lmao
<adsjlkdk>	your name is disgusting
<adsjlkdk>	can someone please kick me
<treefiddy_>	that was a good movie
<adsjlkdk>	its almost disgusting as south park
<treefiddy_>	south park rocks!
<irreverant>	EjaculatingGirl, i'm doubtful of you being a girl
<irreverant>	and no a boob feels like many things depending on mileage and age and after-market parts
<EjaculatingGirl>	irreverant i guess you've never felt a boob before
<Romance>	men who havent taste boob are noob
<AnTi_MTtr>	or bottle fed
<irreverant>	lol
<irreverant>	aw; tell me EjaculatingGirl what does a boob feel like?
<irreverant>	I married so no, by rule of marriage - no more boob for me; maybe some side boob but thats it
<treefiddy_>	dirty pillows
<irreverant>	generally they feel nice; but they can be hard and nasty with implants or flabby and saggy like a roll of nickles in a sock
<ketas>	breast... meh
<treefiddy_>	i have an awkward boner now
<ketas>	it will pass

<adsjlkdk>	hopefully nothing goes wrong
<lala>	Perfect!
<sheep>	adsjlkdk: you're going to pick the wrong system profile, forget an important config option in the kernel, and forget a use flag that you wanted
<lala>	If only IRC was easier to use and more intuitive.
<sheep>	it's largely up to the client
<adsjlkdk>	what do you mean wrong system profile
<lala>	If only IRC clients were easier to use and more intuitive.
<sheep>	for example, you choose the developer profile instead of the desktop profile

<artwoodwork>	I cannot stand british "comedy"
<artwoodwork>	so cringy, all of it
<treefiddy_>	haha
<comma8_>	Mr. Bean
<comma8_>	I'm looking for a gift for my Aunt.
<comma8_>	Most British comedy is terrible - just like most American comedy.
<comma8_>	There are gems though.
<CHVNX>	Perhaps the best comedy show from Britain was Mitchell & Webb.
<KindOne>	artwoodwork, jimmy carr
<artwoodwork>	KindOne, jimmy page
<CHVNX>	Jimmy Carr and Ricky Gervais are both hilarious. In fact, there are a lot of great British comedians, but half of them are Americans or Canadians living in the UK.
<artwoodwork>	my problem is with the absurd laugh-track
<CHVNX>	Katherine Ryan, Rich Hall, etc.
<penguin1263>	ugh
<CHVNX>	Non-British people who are huge in the UK, but not anywhere else.
<penguin1263>	the htc one m8 and m9 are waterproof
<artwoodwork>	*being scene* zoom on actors face
<artwoodwork>	actor raises eyebrow
<artwoodwork>	HILARIOUS LAUGHTER
<artwoodwork>	actor: eh (with funny face)
<artwoodwork>	HILARIOUS LAUGHTER
<artwoodwork>	we're 2 seconds in and nothing has happened, but everyone is losing their shit
<penguin1263>	when everythings so clean it turns into chrome
<treefiddy_>	right. cause no show in the US has ever used a laugh track
<artwoodwork>	missing the point
<treefiddy_>	except the ones that do, and they're using the same laugh track that was recorded back in the 50's
<artwoodwork>	and people aren't puke-laughing over every single play on words or snoddy expression
<dw1>	it's funny how alarmist browsers have made self-signed certs
<dw1>	er that sorta makes sense
<nealshire>	Since I don't fully understand bitcoin, I have a conspiracy theory(kinda like most conspiracy theories!!):
<dw1>	the average user would be scared by self-signed cert warnings
<artwoodwork>	i swear I could have a top ten sitcom in britian by raising my eyebrows and saying "rather"
<artwoodwork>	for 30 mins a day
<nealshire>	What if the whole BTC mining scheme was actually a giant conspiracy to make rainbow tables to crack encryption algorithms?
<penguin1263>	buy an HTC One M9
<penguin1263>	its practically waterproof
<nealshire>	alternatively, what if it was started by hardware manufactures like AMD to get you to buy more of their product?
<Equinoxdawg>	artwoodwork: do you think americans are any better
<Equinoxdawg>	pro-tip: they're not

<artwoodwork>	i'm just stating my opinion Equinoxdawg, you can have yours
<artwoodwork>	too much laugh track ruins shows, regardless of where they are from

<Cpgeek>	test
<artwoodwork>	you passed Cpgeek
<Cpgeek>	easiest test evar
<Cpgeek>	:D
<Cpgeek>	posit a relationship between 3 people, all ~30 years old, 2 bisexual women and a straight man.  woman A has 2 children from a previous relationship and is sterile, woman b has never had children but wants to make some, everyone in the relationship wants to care for them.  is this relationship future-functional or destined to fail.  what are the factors?  I'm attempting to write realistic fiction.
<uxfi>	hey fellas
<artwoodwork>	that would never work cp
<artwoodwork>	Cpgeek,
<Cpgeek>	why is that?
<artwoodwork>	jealousy and failed dreams
<Nightmare>	it depends on whether or not the man wants children or not
<Cpgeek>	he does, in fact that's why my protaganist is checking out their way of life to begin with
<artwoodwork>	why would everyone in the relationship want to care for the one women's children and potential others?
<artwoodwork>	makes no sense
<artwoodwork>	you're reaching too far
<Cpgeek>	there are already 2 children there already, and they are cared for by the 3 of them.
<artwoodwork>	that alone is a reach
<Nightmare>	indeed
<Cpgeek>	the point is to introduce a working but complex situation.
<artwoodwork>	have you been around children?
<Cpgeek>	yes
<artwoodwork>	for more than 2 hours at a time?
<artwoodwork>	i sugest you find someone with 2x 2-4 year olds and spend the day with them
<artwoodwork>	then rethink your plot
<Cpgeek>	why?
<artwoodwork>	nothing I can type here can explain the experience
<Cpgeek>	my fiancee's sister, who lives with us has a 3 year old that i'm with much of the time.
<artwoodwork>	one is way different than two
<artwoodwork>	it's like factors of 100
<artwoodwork>	squared
<Equinoxdawg>	artwoodwork: do you have one or two kids?
<artwoodwork>	1
<artwoodwork>	and only 1 for a reason
<artwoodwork>	i have lots of friends with multiple kids
<Equinoxdawg>	ah
<DoverMo>	cuz of chinese laws
<coldsparrow>	caprophage
<MINIMAN10000>	alright so im on google chrome and ive sometimes thought using a 60% would free up a lot of deskspace but i don't like the idea of losing my arrow keys since I use them to go up and down pages slowly. are there other keyboard keys that slowly move up and down the page that I don't know about?
<artwoodwork>	the hell are you talking about
<Equinoxdawg>	what is a 60%
<artwoodwork>	google chrome is removing keys from your keyboard?

<treefiddy_>	what was it before?

<treefiddy_>	a gleaming bastion of the purest beings of light human civilization has to offer?
<DoverMo>	treefiddy_, that's 4chan
<treefiddy_>	cause that sounds boring as shit
<MINIMAN10000>	Cpgeek, As I said 60% keyboard. there would be no track pad. It's nice just being able to hold a key down to scroll as i read things but I guess that just wouldnt be possible with a 60% keyboard maybe id be better off with an 80%
<Cpgeek>	... or a mouse?
<MINIMAN10000>	using a mouse you have to continuously scroll it isnt the same as holding down a key
<treefiddy_>	or spinning a little wheel with your finger
<treefiddy_>	of which most are controllable and you can just press down the middle mouse button and it turns the cursor into navigation mode
<treefiddy_>	and your mouse movements move within the application
<Cpgeek>	yeah, just middle-click the webpage or whatever, and move your mouse down just a bit and it'll continue to scroll at whatever speed you set it at until you click again
<MINIMAN10000>	to many times theres links in the way stopping me from middle clicking
<MINIMAN10000>	its why i dont usually middle click it just isnt reliable
<MINIMAN10000>	least i should say rarely
<treefiddy_>	bells?
<treefiddy_>	is that you?
<treefiddy_>	I CANT
<treefiddy_>	I WONT
<MINIMAN10000>	hells bells?
<treefiddy_>	I TRIED
<coldsparrow>	non-sense
<Equinoxdawg>	MINIMAN10000: do you also have job problems
<MINIMAN10000>	yep
<MINIMAN10000>	I see my stubborn preference of using keyboard to move on webpages akin to my refusal to switch to tiled window managers or using vi
<coldsparrow>	MINIMAN10000, this is'nt a support channel
<MINIMAN10000>	yeah its quite literally a general chat channel
<coldsparrow>	take it elsewhere
<treefiddy_>	no
<coldsparrow>	try ##windows
<MINIMAN10000>	fun fact /join #general redirects to #chat
<MINIMAN10000>	#chrome would be closer than #windows would be and even then it's iffy
<MINIMAN10000>	and #windows isnt much of a support channel either

<MINIMAN10000>	where at Equinoxdawg?
<Equinoxdawg>	One of the main fruit growing places in New Zealand
<Equinoxdawg>	we have rain like once a month, it's nice
<MINIMAN10000>	ah
<MINIMAN10000>	yeah here in washington its like rain every other day for 1/2 the year it seems lol
<Equinoxdawg>	does it snow?
<MINIMAN10000>	like once or twice for a few days at a time during the winter every other year
<CHVNX>	Snow is an Inuit conspiracy, man.
<MINIMAN10000>	but its because im at the other side of the mountains so were in a spot which gets abnormally low snow

<JessicaJ>	but for the fishiest fish ppl say its too fishy tasting for them
<JessicaJ>	yeah lol
<JessicaJ>	since when are fish not supposed to be fishy
<tortib>	that's why you smother it with lemon
<treefiddy_>	when they're battered and deep fried
<JessicaJ>	and tartar sauce
<pingfloyd>	one of the best fish dinners I had was with freshly caught trout cooked over open flames of a campfire

<JessicaJ>	hi ayetofu
<JessicaJ>	hi exitnode5
<treefiddy_>	pain
<treefiddy_>	miles and miles of pain
<ayetofu>	Hey JessicaJ
<exitnode5>	Not much. Just hanging out on freenode and wanting to bring up taboo topics
<JessicaJ>	here.. idk... be careful
<ayetofu>	The lets begin shall we?
<coldsparrow>	caprophage
<totem>	JessicaJ, i'm not english. can you teach me talk dirty?
<exitnode5>	Really Jessica? This is supposed to be a free and open chat.
<JessicaJ>	totem, im not english either.. and no i wont
<exitnode5>	It's FREE node.
<JessicaJ>	exitnode5, tell me about it.. maybe a different room would have more tolerance
<JessicaJ>	yeah.. well this room gets locked down pretty easily
<JessicaJ>	been there, done that
<ayetofu>	Well theres no need to be mean to each other.
<exitnode5>	Ayetofu true
<JessicaJ>	not even that
<JessicaJ>	trust me
<treefiddy_>	exitnode5: this channel follows SHARIA law
<JessicaJ>	could be anything
<exitnode5>	I mean I get the locking down aspect.
<treefiddy_>	even stuff the FCC allows on tv during prime time is off limits here
<JessicaJ>	locking down meaning booting your butt out
<James_T>	exitnode5: no, it's FREE* node
<James_T>	*may charge a fee, also tor is awesome
<ayetofu>	Haha. James_T
<James_T>	:P
<pingfloyd>	the didn't do their homework in this From Dusk Till Dawn Series, a beheaded vampire was still attacking.
<JessicaJ>	charge you with breakiing their code of conduct
<James_T>	ye
<James_T>	:P
<exitnode5>	well I get it. They're upset because people abuse the anonymity.
<JessicaJ>	exitnode5, not even that
<JessicaJ>	doesnt have to be vulgar even
<James_T>	people were abusing tor
<James_T>	one special someone made it into popular culture
<James_T>	HOW i don't know.
<treefiddy_>	the only ones that need that level of security are doing shit that's illegal enough that they'd get real time if caught
<pingfloyd>	exitnode5: freenode is free as in beer not freedom
<exitnode5>	Who made it into popular culture
<James_T>	was at a hacker con on the weekend
<ayetofu>	So saying vulgar language is out of the question  I'm guessing.
<pingfloyd>	exitnode5: it is very far removed from the latter
<James_T>	police commissioner was asking one of the speakers why they would use tor
<James_T>	>.>
<James_T>	XD
<James_T>	embarrassing++
<exitnode5>	Oh I get what's going on here. You guys are making fun of me because I'm an exit node.
<ayetofu>	That may be the case...
<JessicaJ>	ayetofu, no u can say vulgar language.. its just dependent on it if offends the OP in some way or another. not even the rest of the chatters
<JessicaJ>	exitnode5, no.. totes serious
<pingfloyd>	James_T: a police would ask that question because their simple minds work under the false pretense that one only cares about privacy if they have something to hide.
<exitnode5>	exit node needs to become the new "ass hole"
<ayetofu>	Ah so its basically a dictatorship in a round about way.
<James_T>	pingfloyd: they knew what tor was
<pingfloyd>	James_T: likely a baited question even
<James_T>	were only doing it for lulz
<James_T>	yes
<JessicaJ>	ayetofu, aye.. now u got it
<James_T>	pingfloyd: eh, cops often attend these kind of conferences
<pingfloyd>	I think giving the finger to the NSA is a good enough reason
<James_T>	learn some things :)
<ayetofu>	Thats lovely! I say we revolt.
<AAA_awright>	DEFCON even has a "spot the Fed" award or reward doesn't it?
<JessicaJ>	ayetofu, revolt if you want to get kicked out. simple enough
<JessicaJ>	lol AAA_awright
<James_T>	AAA_awright: most of these coppers got work to pay, too
<James_T>	it's a fun thing to go to
<funkentelechrxp>	If anyone gets too many pointless time wasting emails at work, set up an autoreply with this: http://i.imgur.com/2Rj5Q8v.jpg
<pingfloyd>	didn't defcon have the FBI come give a talk once
<exitnode5>	But isn't being against the nsa a taboo thing? I thought taboo things were not welcome here.
<JessicaJ>	exitnode5, results may vary
<pingfloyd>	or was that C3?
<JessicaJ>	this isnt a govt website
<JessicaJ>	so its okay to hate on the NSA
<JessicaJ>	say terrorist.. i dare you :P
<ayetofu>	And here is the next problem. I would revolt. But that's too much work to be honest and I'm feeling quite lazy.
<exitnode5>	far be it from me to call upstanding patriots terrorists.
<exitnode5>	defeat the new world order!
<JessicaJ>	ayetofu, u dont even have to try.. just say something not politcally correct and .. try to explain why
<JessicaJ>	insert awkward silence here .
<exitnode5>	Ok but truly taboo things fall outside the bounds of political correctness.
<JessicaJ>	exactly
<exitnode5>	No, I mean, there's no politically correct way to talk about it.
<ayetofu>	Thats true.
<JessicaJ>	just sayin.. i have a story .. :/
<totem>	NSA?
<ayetofu>	Do tell us then.
<pingfloyd>	why do you feel politically correct is correct in the first place?
*	forks_ is now known as forks
<pingfloyd>	because it's what you've been told?

<ayetofu>	That's correct
<JessicaJ>	ayetofu, only in PM.. ive been told you cant diss the OPs or talk about it openly here.. part of the silencing policy
<exitnode5>	the best way to join the new world order is to start masturbating to snuff films. That's how you join the system and become the political elite.
<ayetofu>	PM me then? I'm very interested and curious.
<JessicaJ>	or you could me :P
<JessicaJ>	just the fact
<JessicaJ>	s
<ayetofu>	Oh jeez. But im so lazy remember?
<exitnode5>	well now I know your secrets. I've discovered how you deal with taboo topics.
<JessicaJ>	ayetofu, up to you
<JessicaJ>	exitnode5, lol
<JessicaJ>	gotta play by the rules if u wanna play here
<exitnode5>	The secrets of #chat are mine to behold.
<JessicaJ>	##chat*
<JessicaJ>	get it right or u dont get in
<exitnode5>	but seriously though. How about sex with animals.
<JessicaJ>	its called beastiality
<ayetofu>	^ truth
<exitnode5>	some people are sexually into the idea of being eaten and digested. Apparently it's called vore?
<JessicaJ>	i wouldnt know :/
<JessicaJ>	i thought it was called cannibalism
<exitnode5>	No, it's not called cannibalism. It's definitely called vore. I think
<exitnode5>	There's also this thing called "adult babies" where people get off on the idea of being a baby again.
<klixa>	cannibalism would mean you eat someone else....
<klixa>	theres all kinds of things...
<JessicaJ>	it means someone gets eaten... either way
<JessicaJ>	in one sense anyway
<JessicaJ>	hey swift110-phone

<exitnode5>	Tocsin yes?
<tortib>	I rather speak to a doctor about it

<tortib>	Can I find a 24 hour doctor that will come to the home?
<exitnode5>	I want to talk about sex with animals, but no, we have to go on a wild goose chase for doctors who will write prescriptions that aren't necessary because tortib thinks he's smarter than the doctors.
<Thete>	Emergency Room

<forks>	lol no
<Thete>	gheraint: agreed
<exitnode5>	Fine, then you can't discuss gays then either.
<tortib>	exitnode5, how do you know i'm not smarter or as intelligent as a doctor?
<exitnode5>	everything gay has to be off the table as a discussion topic.
<sunstar>	?
<exitnode5>	There's nothing intelligent to be said about male male sexual relations. It's a taboo thing that should remain undiscussed.
<tortib>	nobody is talking about male male sexual relations except you
<tortib>	I'm talking about a physical aliment
<exitnode5>	But that's not even a topic of discussion. No one on irc is going to write you a prescription.
<exitnode5>	you may as well be asking for next week's lotto numbers.
<sunstar>	can i get em?
<tocsin>	i could get my friend who is a doctor to write you a prescription if you send me bitcoin

<exitnode5>	tocsin bitcoin is appalling.

<exitnode5>	Tortib just go to the doctor and tell them what's wrong with you. They will give you the correct prescription.

<vodkode>	lol
<exitnode5>	ok, so, here's the next topic. What If I got a blow up doll, and put Hillary Clinton's face on it, and just raped the shit out of it and beat it till it popped?
<sunstar>	and what would that accomplish?
<sunstar>	are you at least gonna post it online?
<supferrets>	make better choices
<exitnode5>	Yes posting it online is the whole point.

<tacoshellmcgee>	It supposedly kills the unhatched eggs
<redcheckers>	tacoshellmcgee: does grinding up matter?
<supferrets>	I started getting skin rashes and developed allergies to food stuffs, my body temp increased where I was sweating not even moving, probably because I was consuming large volumes of wine and beer..
<redcheckers>	cool
<Taco>	mate just have a cup of concrete
<redcheckers>	tacoshellmcgee: so you gonna send me the walnut stuff?
<redcheckers>	tacoshellmcgee: i dont have concrete, i can get marlboros and they have the same ingredients
<tacoshellmcgee>	tee hee
<Taco>	far from it
<Taco>	but harden up aye
<redcheckers>	tacoshellmcgee: nikes or concrete overshoes?
<tacoshellmcgee>	I only put concrete on shoes when i want the body to not float
<redcheckers>	the body would still float.
<redcheckers>	it just would float further down.
<tacoshellmcgee>	Let's test it

<tacoshellmcgee>	I just bought 12 tubes of 4.6 oz toothpaste on ebay

<redcheckers>	tacoshellmcgee: how many teeth do you have
<tacoshellmcgee>	A lot
<ForexTraderNYC>	cool
<redcheckers>	tacoshellmcgee: and, do you think deet would kill a nematode?
<tacoshellmcgee>	Even my penis has a tooth
<ForexTraderNYC>	toothpaste
<redcheckers>	tacoshellmcgee: pics or it didnt happen.
<ForexTraderNYC>	i bot razors from ebay
<redcheckers>	ForexTraderNYC: not me. i bought razors from shtick
<tacoshellmcgee>	i bot razors from dollar shave club
<ForexTraderNYC>	i like my razor with a curve
<ForexTraderNYC>	i keep sideburns
<redcheckers>	i like my razor with a sharp edge

<idioterna>	i have a straight razor and that fake synthetic hamster or badger or whatever it is brush
<idioterna>	and soap
<tacoshellmcgee>	Sometimes I leave a lil scruff on my balls even when I bone down
<redcheckers>	tacoshellmcgee: do you still have crabs?
<idioterna>	now that i said that
<idioterna>	i'm a little worried i might be a prepper
<redcheckers>	idioterna: why so?
<ketas>	little hoarder
<redcheckers>	hourderves?
<idioterna>	they love stuff they can still use after the apocalypse strikes
<idioterna>	and i guess a straight razor might be one of them
<tacoshellmcgee>	I have crabs
<redcheckers>	tacoshellmcgee: maybe shaving would help
<tacoshellmcgee>	I eat a lot of garlic

<Butt3rfly>	morning all
*	Butt3rfly overslept :o
<DoverMo>	Butt3rfly, uh oh
<diogenese>	Morning Butt3rfly
<redcheckers>	Butt3rfly: good morning, any thoughts on how to kill a nematode that dug under my skin earlier?
<hhmmm>	redcheckers, use a hammer ;)
<redcheckers>	hhmmm: i dont have a hammer.
<Butt3rfly>	nematodes are pretty tough to kill
<redcheckers>	Butt3rfly: really?
<redcheckers>	Butt3rfly: what about temperature shock, or deet, or maybe some kerosene?
<redcheckers>	or a long soak in chlorine filled water?
<Butt3rfly>	they can survive in space with zero oxygen
<sunstar>	^
<DoverMo>	go to a hospital, assuming they don't detain you and charge you for detaining you
<redcheckers>	really?
<Butt3rfly>	yes
<sunstar>	just go to the er
<redcheckers>	DoverMo: well, i can got to something resembling a hospital for free... but without an appointment it is unlikely i would be seen in the first 8 hours
<sunstar>	just go to the er
<redcheckers>	DoverMo: so i'm gonna call in the morning and ask...
<redcheckers>	sunstar: the er is pretty full by now i think, it's a bit after bar closing time on cinqo de mayo, and there is a full moon and a rainstorm
<redcheckers>	even the police got in a car wreck earlier and its already on the news
<sunstar>	lol
<sunstar>	yea
<redcheckers>	sunstar: newson6.com
<DoverMo>	redcheckers, try using acid
<sunstar>	but i didnt meen right this second. sure your going to the er but its not an emergency
<redcheckers>	DoverMo: i dont have any acid except coca cola.
<redcheckers>	DoverMo: you remember that movie with brendan frazier, the mummy, where that scarab runs under the guys skin and he can see it under there?
<sunstar>	lol ur an okie
<DoverMo>	redcheckers, since they live in bases, acid would be the opposite
<redcheckers>	i only saw it for a few seconds before it went under and then the skin where it had dug in sloughed off and its a big red sore now
<redcheckers>	sunstar: am not.
<redcheckers>	DoverMo: but it still annoys me to know that some littler life form has damaged my skin and i don't get to gratifyingly execute it in response
<DoverMo>	hmm
<redcheckers>	DoverMo: its under the skin now though, so there's no where to apply the acid until it comes back out.
<sunstar>	yes there is. just keep on pouring untill you get it
<redcheckers>	sunstar: i dont have that much coca cola. if i believed coca cola would work
<sunstar>	i do
<redcheckers>	sunstar: there's some vids on youtube of dropping ham in coca cola and watching little worms jump up though
<sunstar>	no
<redcheckers>	yes there are
<sunstar>	oh god no
<sunstar>	dont wanna see
<sunstar>	dont wanna know such things
<DoverMo>	oh
<DoverMo>	redcheckers, rubbing alcohol :D ?
<redcheckers>	shrug, i think it's better than looking at national health articles on migration of parasites into other organs like heart, kidneys, liver, and eye
<redcheckers>	DoverMo: i dont have any rubbing alcohol, just vodka , brandy, and kvas
<sunstar>	and why would i do that?
<redcheckers>	DoverMo: and already applied some vodka to the sore as a dis-infectant
<sunstar>	stick some up yer keister
<sunstar>	in a tasmpon
<redcheckers>	sunstar: if you think about the distance the worm would have to crawl under the skin for that to matter
<sunstar>	it's to help you forget you have worms
<redcheckers>	forgetting isnt a solution bro. that's like a crazy cat lady forgetting she has cats and letting them get hungry enough to eat her alive
<sunstar>	i hate when that happens
<DoverMo>	i wonder if i have any wormies
<redcheckers>	because once animals taste human blood...
<redcheckers>	they dont switch back
<idioterna>	if you have an immune system, you probably don't have worms
<redcheckers>	idioterna: i have a hyperactive immune system
<idioterna>	sorry to hear
<idioterna>	i hope it doesn't go around punching your relatives
<idioterna>	or cops
<redcheckers>	idioterna: but the worms probably are able to move strongly out of any cyst that would form
<idioterna>	maybe
<redcheckers>	probably.
<tacoshellmcgee>	Watching goodfellas on google play
<tacoshellmcgee>	Love it
<redcheckers>	forget about it
<idioterna>	is it different when you watch it on google play?
<redcheckers>	or is that donnie brasco
<redcheckers>	x.x
<tacoshellmcgee>	Nah they say forget about it in all mob films
<redcheckers>	ah. really.
<redcheckers>	what about ray liota saying sweetheart
<redcheckers>	does that happen in all mob films too
<tacoshellmcgee>	The one that they use it the most is probably mickey blue eyes, they make it a point to emphasize and make fun of it
<redcheckers>	tacoshellmcgee: so who is cooler. the italian american organized crime syndicate sometimelys theatrically referred to as the mafia, or that group of internet users with the V for vendetta masks?
<tacoshellmcgee>	I try to chew my food 40 times before swallowing

<Butt3rfly>	you do know that you need a microscope to actually 'see' a nematode?
<LauraCottonTail>	what's a nematode
<DoverMo>	use the soda!
<redcheckers>	Butt3rfly: thats not true.
<idioterna>	i have a microscope, but
<redcheckers>	Butt3rfly: it was almost 2 mm long
<idioterna>	you can see one without it if you can get it to wiggle on glass or something
<tacoshellmcgee>	What if i have a nematode in me?
<tacoshellmcgee>	FUCK
<redcheckers>	tacoshellmcgee: you don't. you have an amoeba that is slowly burrowing into your brain
<DoverMo>	tacoshellmcgee, then you are a mother
<idioterna>	you have lots of single celled organisms in you that can take care of that bad boy

<tacoshellmcgee>	I floss probably 2 -3 times a day
<LauraCottonTail>	i was so scared i thought i was done
<sunstar>	they would be bitten?
<tacoshellmcgee>	I dont like shit sitting in between my gum/teeth

<sunstar>	http://img0.joyreactor.cc/pics/post/full/ubuntu-my-little-pony-mlp-%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0-%D1%84%D1%8D%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BC%D1%8B-1552185.jpeg
<princefakhan>	What trivia?
<sunstar>	whoa
<hmir>	MLP makes me very queasy...
<DoverMo>	sunstar, yes a unicorn has appeared
<sunstar>	i got gored by a unicorn in oblivion. im still a lil shaken up
<DoverMo>	hehe
<DoverMo>	the unicorn, guarded by the minotaur
<hmir>	Oh noes you're a gamer?
<DoverMo>	i always wondered about unicorns
<DoverMo>	something
<sunstar>	i thought i was gonna see one some day
<sunstar>	maybe by a lake w/ a crystal forest
<DoverMo>	bethesda ruined fallout 3 and nv
<sunstar>	i hear nothing but good about those games. never played them cuz they looked boring
<DoverMo>	sunstar, good if you count ruined as good
<sunstar>	hey couldnt be any worse than fallout 1
<DoverMo>	yes it could?
<MrElendig>	DoverMo: not really, both of them were quite decent
<MrElendig>	and like most games, they are better when modded
<DoverMo>	MrElendig, not in comparison to fallout 1 and 2
<DoverMo>	decent or good in comparison to toher games
<sunstar>	fallout 1 was one of the worste games i've ever played
<DoverMo>	sunstar, did you complete it?
<sunstar>	nope
<DoverMo>	sunstar, why not
<sunstar>	i rarely finish games. once i get a new one i stop playing the old one and that one was so bad i went out to buy a new game early
<DoverMo>	lol
<MrElendig>	DoverMo: I've played all of them and imo fallout 3 was a good game when compared to the earlier ones too
<DoverMo>	sunstar, there was nothing bad about the design
<sunstar>	iv been playing san andreas since it came out and im only just now getting to san fiero
<MrElendig>	they did a fairly good job at turning it into a 3d game
<DoverMo>	sunstar, maybe isometric isn't your thing?
<DoverMo>	MrElendig, good? but it's nothing like the previous
<sunstar>	dont remember what that means
<DoverMo>	there's literally zero similarities
<hhmmm>	rAWr
<sunstar>	i liked bedlam. that game rocked
<DoverMo>	the only similarities are the 'names' / 'labels'
<MrElendig>	DoverMo: uhm wrong?
<MrElendig>	there were a lot of similarities
<sunstar>	what was the first computer game yall played?
<DoverMo>	MrElendig, give me some
<DoverMo>	first computer game i played was this maze/puzzle game on an apple
<Butt3rfly>	the first ever? manic miner
<MrElendig>	DoverMo: story, a lot of the game mechanics etc
<hhmmm>	fighting with sticks !!!
<sunstar>	Troll's Tale
<Butt3rfly>	I may have played ping pong before that though
<Butt3rfly>	on atari
<Butt3rfly>	lol
<hhmmm>	what about asteroids on the table machines
<DoverMo>	MrElendig, are you joking. there are EN-OH(no) game mechanics that are the same. story, i guess. the story didn't exactly follow the norm, but it's plausible
<MrElendig>	there are a lot of similar game mechanics
<DoverMo>	MrElendig, i can't think of any
<hhmmm>	or handheld single game machines
<DoverMo>	none of the stats, none of the skills, none of the perks...
<MrElendig>	just because the perks doesn't do exactly the same, that doesn't mean the mechanics are different
<MrElendig>	you still have a skill/perk system that is quite similar
<DoverMo>	similar is not the same mechanic
<DoverMo>	either
<hhmmm>	wow
<MrElendig>	they could after all have just made it a linear shooter with no skill/perk tree
<DoverMo>	none of those skills are similar to the original
<MrElendig>	like certain other companies :p
<hhmmm>	kickickickick
<DoverMo>	i'm thinking, that the only thing that is remotely similar, are some of the weapons
<DoverMo>	and even then, they all have their own custom 'spin' on them
<DoverMo>	they don't operate on the same principals
<DoverMo>	i say that very leniently, because i never liked many of the weapons anyway
<sunstar>	hmm... just noticed... Troll's Tale made in 1984 by Sierra On-Line
<sunstar>	didnt know there was an On-Line in 1984
<DoverMo>	Sierra Gopher
<sunstar>	thought we were still dialing up to boards
<sabotender>	moo
<sabotender>	🐮
<Thete>	I think they were always called that
<Thete>	I miss Sierra
<Thete>	nobody makes adventure games anymore
<DoverMo>	MrElendig, i'm not grateful either, because bethesda still claimed the trademark over the legal issue
<sunstar>	they were visionaries. naming themselves after the internet when the internet hadnt been made yet
<DoverMo>	bethesda has a well documented history of making contract deals and producing poor titles for them
<sunstar>	i always like their games
<sunstar>	them n pandemic
<DoverMo>	some of them were hits
<DoverMo>	'some' keyword
<DoverMo>	a larger amount of them were not

<sabotender>	mmm I have a craving for Marmite
<Butt3rfly>	eugch
<Butt3rfly>	you can have my share too
<sabotender>	but its tasty!
<Butt3rfly>	it's good for making gravy
<sabotender>	goes well with a baked salmon breakfast
<Butt3rfly>	mmm salmon
<Butt3rfly>	I haven't had any salmon for a while
<sabotender>	skin on. The skin is the best part, lol
<sabotender>	I keep a lot of frozen sealed salmon in my freezer :-D
<Butt3rfly>	I have a freezer, a really nice large one, and I hardly ever use it
<sabotender>	eh why?
<Butt3rfly>	I mostly buy day to day, I have no real need to squash all of my shopping into one trip
<Butt3rfly>	I rather have fresh food
<sunstar>	costco has the best salmon
<honey>	hai sabotender
<Butt3rfly>	the only vegetable that I like after it's been frozen is sweetcorn
<Butt3rfly>	frozen brocolli and sprouts are horrid
<sabotender>	fresh frozen can be just as satisfying, but you must like driving often. I cannot drive a lot. I have a herb and vegetable garden on my balcony
*	sabotender adds a bit of honey to his tea
<Butt3rfly>	I don't drive at all
<sabotender>	ah you have a slave that does all the fresh food driving for you??
<Butt3rfly>	no, I have all the fresh food I could want within a 5 minute walk
<sunstar>	used to live out in the country. back then neighbors be bringing over hoardes of food cuz they grew too much
<sabotender>	hehe
<Butt3rfly>	I have to walk for 10 minutes to buy the more exotic fresh foods
<sabotender>	I think the food that comes from my garden is superior than what you get from the market
<Butt3rfly>	and 10 minutes in the other direction, and I'm in the countryside
<Butt3rfly>	yes I grow a lot of stuff too sabotender
<Butt3rfly>	especially raspberries and strawberries
<sunstar>	theres a 100 yr old farm right in the middle of downtown  :P
<sabotender>	I grow a variety of cucumbers, for example, that are actually sweet instead of the plain ones that are grown. my tomatoes are also sweeter and not grainy like the ones at the grocery store
<sunstar>	every household should have a solar powered aquaponic garden
<Butt3rfly>	sugar snap peas, runner beans, artichokes, onions and garlic, fennel and a whole heap of other herbs
<Butt3rfly>	brussel sprouts over winter
<sabotender>	oh I dont like those. too bitter
<sunstar>	too gross
<Butt3rfly>	I love them
<sabotender>	i never liked them
<Butt3rfly>	I hated them as a child, but my tastes have changed a lot over the years
<sabotender>	I hate avocados. They make me puke. Every time.
<sabotender>	lol
<Butt3rfly>	me too
<Butt3rfly>	and I can't eat mushrooms either
*	sunstar just ate a whole avacado
<sabotender>	oh I love mushrooms. um...but they have to be cooked, or else they give me a sour stomach
<sunstar>	i love em too
<Butt3rfly>	mushroom texture goes through me like fingernails on a chalkboard
<sunstar>	its rott
<Butt3rfly>	it's not the taste I can't take
<sunstar>	your eating fungus
<Butt3rfly>	the texture makes me cringe
<DoverMo>	Butt3rfly, lol same O:
<sabotender>	I especially like straw and shiitake mushrooms
<sabotender>	portobellos are tasty too
<sunstar>	yup
<DoverMo>	mushroom, is a challenge. has to be uncooked and have to swallow it quickly
<Butt3rfly>	picking mushrooms is fun, I do like mushroom hunting
<sunstar>	yeah mushroom hunting
<DoverMo>	and usually only like 3 nibbles at most
<sabotender>	I will NEVER eat a wild mushroom
<sunstar>	i always find a mountain lion skull when i go mushroom hunting
*	Gluesticky casts wild mushroom.
<sabotender>	had a great uncle who died from eating a wild mushroom, and he was an expert gatherer
<Gluesticky>	Too bad so sad.
<Butt3rfly>	we have whole associations dedicated to collecting wild edible mushrooms in the uk, it can be quite lucrative
<Gluesticky>	Why do people do it?
<sunstar>	the royal lycan society
<Gluesticky>	Do they just like taking risks?
<sunstar>	its enjoyable and you get good shrooms
<Gluesticky>	How?
<sunstar>	if your the outdoorsy type
<sunstar>	i used to have a great spot but then the owner died and left it to PG&E
<sabotender>	There are some varieties that I may hunt for, you know, the ones that are impossible to mistake for a poisonous toadstool. Like...oh...a chicken mushroom has no poisonous lookalike.
<Butt3rfly>	I once saw a wild puffball mushroom, it was enormous
<sunstar>	holy crap its almost 4:30am
<Butt3rfly>	like, basketball sized
<Gluesticky>	Wild mushrooms are scary.
<sunstar>	night all
<idioterna>	oh yes
<idioterna>	very much so
<idioterna>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnsfRWaDL-E
<sabotender>	but seriously. Don't go wild mushroom hunting unless you have the scientific facilities to test each and every one for a possible toadstool
<sunstar>	or one of those friends you really dont like to use as a taste tester
<Butt3rfly>	lol
<Gluesticky>	What is toadstool?
<grayC>	poison
<grayC>	anything that is white underneathis poisinous
<sabotender>	poisonous mushrooms aren't called mushrooms. They are called toadstools. There's no edible toadstool.

<Romance>	any greek here?
<H2O1>	unfortunately, the heyday of Greece is long gone
<Romance>	where have they gone
<H2O1>	to the recycle bin
<H2O1>	2500 years ago, Greece had the most brilliant period of any place/any time in history
<H2O1>	with Socrates, Plato, Aristotle
<H2O1>	Athena, the city and the goddess
<Romance>	how can they survive today, they dont have money
<H2O1>	they have only debt
<H2O1>	that probably due to corruption, the rich took the money and moved it to the Cayman islands
<Romance>	its a good time, hopefully i can find a greek girl to date, they will be desperate for moeny
<H2O1>	(tax haven)
<H2O1>	you can date LauraCottonTail  in this room
<H2O1>	lol
<bazhang>	hilariouso
<Romance>	cayman island, that remind me of our country so called 'investment' lol, Malaysia. and now we have debt around $15 billion USD
<SimenOlai>	bazhang, what country you from
<Romance>	is cayman island a scam land?
<bazhang>	the mythical lazy greek theory
<bazhang>	when in fact they work much longer hours than their german peers
<H2O1>	the Cayman Island is a tax heaven where all the crooks on the planet hide their booty
<SimenOlai>	Is "Mommystomach" a thing in your country?
<Romance>	now that makes sense, our prime minister is crook well of course he is
<SimenOlai>	Where some takes a pic of it, then someone complains about it, being jealous etc?
<SimenOlai>	anyone
<bazhang>	bing it
<bazhang>	the cayman islands were, about 40 years ago
<bazhang>	nowadays, yeah no
<bazhang>	when you have a trillion you need to launder, thats not the place to go
<H2O1>	theres probably $25T (or more) hidden at this moment in tax heavens all over the world
<Romance>	bazhang: Malaysia has this 1MDB investment, the government invested around $15 bil in cayman in hope to get profit, lol but now the money is gone and there is not even one development
<bazhang>	in such cases you hand it over to the vampire squid
<Romance>	government must be stupid
<H2O1>	just corruption
<Romance>	or they took the money for themselves
<Romance>	yes corruption
<bazhang>	if you have never heard of the vampire squid, you really have no business commenting on such matters
<bazhang>	the global shadow econonmy has more than 750 trillion, so 25 trillion is a mere drop in the bucket
<H2O1>	From wikipedia: The vampire squid (Vampyroteuthis infernalis, lit. "vampire squid of Hell") is a small, deep-sea cephalopod found throughout the temperate and tropical oceans of the world.
<Romance>	just binged vampire squid, how does it mater with cayman island bazhang
<H2O1>	75T, not 750T
<H2O1>	the total world economy
<bazhang>	Romance, the cayman islands are dead and gone as far as these matters go
<H2O1>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_world_product
<bazhang>	you mistake world gdp for global debt, which is over 750 trillion
<H2O1>	hmmm
<bazhang>	thats not the vampire squid in question
<H2O1>	reference?
<bazhang>	sometimes more than wikipedia is needed for actual knowledge of the world
<bazhang>	try vampire squid debt for bing terms
<LauraCottonTail>	greek girls I know are very smart
<H2O1>	the Cayman islands are the 4th biggest tax heaven according to this entry http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_haven
<LauraCottonTail>	actually the only greek girls I know, one is an international aclaimed fashion designer
<LauraCottonTail>	the other is in business school and she is a big brain
<bazhang>	funnily enough, the ones most exposed to greek economic issues are German Banks
<LauraCottonTail>	I think they are fairly independant girls
<LauraCottonTail>	try czeck girls
<H2O1>	im glad they are
<bazhang>	and the german banks were there, as was the squid, when the greek were allowd to enter the monetary union
<LauraCottonTail>	the only that matter is Deutsche and they are fine
<bazhang>	LauraCottonTail, that is so far wrong, that no commentary is possible
<LauraCottonTail>	they just raised the salary of their analyst really late but paid the difference from january
<LauraCottonTail>	like most investment banks
<bazhang>	Deutsche bank is anything but fine
<LauraCottonTail>	they aren't as big as before but how can i explain
<banzaikitten>	i just wouldnt even bother listening to bazhang rattle on about economics
<banzaikitten>	waste of everyone time
<LauraCottonTail>	the only difference is that they pay their managing director 250k instead of 550k
<banzaikitten>	why arent i silenced
<LauraCottonTail>	like they used to
<bazhang>	why would you be
<banzaikitten>	gamma silenced me yesterday
<bazhang>	those things expire
<H2O1>	bazbang, here's a quiz for you: 1 million years ago, what was the gross world product? (a) $10M, (b) $100M, (c) $1B ?

<LauraCottonTail>	anyway
<H2O1>	anyway, like Laura said, the answer is here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_world_product
<bazhang>	are you familiar with the term levered
<LauraCottonTail>	if an investment  bank loses money oyu have to be aware their nature of being a firm that prints money barely change
<LauraCottonTail>	so well nothing to cry about
<LauraCottonTail>	they make it up
<LauraCottonTail>	like laura said? I didn't say that. I didn't even click that link
<H2O1>	hmm
<SimenOlai>	H2O1, pretty sure there werent money back then
<LauraCottonTail>	by printing money i don't mean actually printing money. In any other case it would be obvious it's a methaphore. but when talking about banks I guess i need to specify it's a methaphore
*	ChanServ removes quiet on *!*@gateway/web/freenode/ip.92.237.119.90
<bazhang>	really if you dont know about the greek entrance to the monetary union, and how it was accomplished, you dont have much of a clue in these matters
<H2O1>	SimenOlai, you can work without having a currency
<SimenOlai>	Pretty sure humans didnt exist back then
<banzaikitten>	at this rate bazhang is going to give me ops for trolling
<LauraCottonTail>	of course i know what levered means ^^
*	ChanServ gives voice to banzaikitten
<H2O1>	SimenOlai, using the bible in the 1600s a clerk calculated with a precision unmatched by modern science that God created the world at 9:00 A.M., on October 23, 4004 B.C.
<SimenOlai>	Yeah and that makes it 6k years ago
<H2O1>	the dino bones are there just to test the faith of man
<banzaikitten>	cunts?
<SimenOlai>	5/6/2015 4:30:58 PM<H2O1>  here's a quiz for you: 1 million years ago,
<bazhang>	hahaha creationism

<H2O1>	California is thirsty
<idioterna>	i love OCR
<bazhang>	bad virus link nothx
<LauraCottonTail>	i like talking about finance but it's more fun talking about deeper things than things you would learn reading the ft
<idioterna>	oh
<idioterna>	right
<idioterna>	well, ask someone else to show it to you then
<H2O1>	LauraCottonTail, like intelligence design vs evolution
<H2O1>	*intelligent design
<LauraCottonTail>	i meant within finance
<H2O1>	O_O
<LauraCottonTail>	and no, this is also a boring subject
<LauraCottonTail>	like wether santa exists
<H2O1>	does he ?
<idioterna>	no
<LauraCottonTail>	maybe
<idioterna>	i have proof he does not
<H2O1>	how can you prove that something doesnt exist?
<idioterna>	at least
<idioterna>	easy
<H2O1>	nope
<idioterna>	it has properties which cannot simultaneously hold true
<idioterna>	therefore it cannot exist
<SimenOlai>	H2O1, Thats not possible
<H2O1>	you mean its inconsistent
<idioterna>	it's easy to prove a barber who only shaves people who don't shave themselves does not exist
<SimenOlai>	you can never prove something doesnt exist
<idioterna>	of course you can
<H2O1>	thats the Russell paradox
<idioterna>	yes, it is
<bazhang>	bing me wrong bro
<idioterna>	but that man does not exist
<idioterna>	such a man cannot exist
<SimenOlai>	idioterna, why not?
<H2O1>	what about UFOs? that has some similarities with santa
<SimenOlai>	I am 100% sure there is atleast one guy like that
<SimenOlai>	Ufo's exist
<idioterna>	if he shaves all men that don't shave themselves, then he doesn't shave himself
<SimenOlai>	thats a fact
<idioterna>	but if he does not, then he shaves himself
<SimenOlai>	Alien spaceship? We cant know that
<SimenOlai>	but ufo's exist
<idioterna>	you cannnot simultaneously shave and not shave yourself
<idioterna>	therefore such a man cannot and therefore does not exist.
<bazhang>	schrodingers cat can
<idioterna>	ufos might exist
<H2O1>	certainly
<idioterna>	i'm not sure about the cat
<SimenOlai>	idioterna, ufo's DO exist
<idioterna>	if schrodinger had a cat
<idioterna>	then it definitely exists
<SimenOlai>	Do you even know what a ufo is
<idioterna>	SimenOlai: yes, something that flies and we don't know what it is
<SimenOlai>	yeah
<SimenOlai>	that exists
<H2O1>	i say, seriously, that there is probably 1 or 2 aliens who hide among the 500 nicks of this room
<H2O1>	because this is the ideal room to do this
<idioterna>	well the fermi estimate says you're probably wrong, but maybe not.
<H2O1>	on all of IRC
<idioterna>	you just do some basic maths some random vaguely relevant numbers
<idioterna>	and there you have it
<SimenOlai>	idioterna, you said a guy who shaved only
<SimenOlai>	Not a guy who shaved ALL
<idioterna>	yes
<SimenOlai>	And that wouldnt be possible because of time anyway
<idioterna>	yes
<idioterna>	that's also the point in my proff santa does not exist
<idioterna>	at least not in a traditionally accepted form
<idioterna>	he might exist as a hyperdimensional being of some sort
<SimenOlai>	The santa we know is 0% chance exist
<idioterna>	but the kids would say "you're just making that up"
<swift110-phone>	Kk
<idioterna>	need to give them credit for that
<SimenOlai>	The santa we know was created by coca cola anyway
<idioterna>	yes
<Juesto>	haha
<idioterna>	and it was great marketing
<SimenOlai>	was?
<SimenOlai>	is*
<idioterna>	yeah
<SimenOlai>	Aint no christmas without their ads
<idioterna>	yeah, i stand corrected
<SimenOlai>	If there is no ads, christmas is officially cancelled
<idioterna>	http://www.npr.org/2015/05/06/404432206/six-words-my-name-is-jamaal-im-white
<idioterna>	i like this
<SimenOlai>	sounds borin
<SimenOlai>	g
<idioterna>	the slogan is a little lame but the text is nice
<SimenOlai>	Did you guys know, Norway is the country with the highest ammount of tollroads?
<H2O1>	Norway is not that great a country
<H2O1>	its accumulated a $1T fund by selling a polluting product
<SimenOlai>	And its never used
<H2O1>	prices are extremely high on everything
<SimenOlai>	the fund stands untouched
<H2O1>	its full of guns
<SimenOlai>	what is full of guns
<H2O1>	probably more guns that in the US
<idioterna>	yeah, but norway is the only country actively investing in a transparent and responsible manner
<H2O1>	shouldnt be too difficult to google out
<idioterna>	more than any other anyway
<idioterna>	i wish war wasn't so god damn profitable.
<H2O1>	s/more guns that/more guns than/
<idioterna>	yeah but finland and canada also have that
<SimenOlai>	Norway is the country that uses the most renewable energy
<idioterna>	guns are part of the culture there
<SimenOlai>	H2O1, In Norway you arent allowed to wear a gun at all
<H2O1>	Canada doesnt have many guns at all
<idioterna>	like the balkans :)
<idioterna>	H2O1: really?
<H2O1>	absolutely
<idioterna>	the bowling for columbine stated they have more per capita than US
*	ilMentore is now known as ilMentore|Lazer
<idioterna>	or maybe i just remembered it wrong
<H2O1>	absolute nonsense
<H2O1>	guns are about unknown in Canada
<idioterna>	good
<idioterna>	sounds like a good place to raise your kids
<idioterna>	i already taught them never to point a weapon at anything but a safe, inanimate target
<H2O1>	idioterna, are you in Norway?
<idioterna>	like so: https://bou.si/pic/violence-starts-early.jpg
<idioterna>	no
<idioterna>	i'm from slovenia
<SimenOlai>	H2O1, I am
<mchelen1>	yeah canada is nearly 1/3 u.s. per capita gun ownership
<SimenOlai>	His name is swedish
<idioterna>	where guns are under a lot of regulation
<H2O1>	those small republics have their originality
<LauraCottonTail>	I think kids shouldn't point guns at anything
<idioterna>	mchelen1: thanks
<SimenOlai>	define gun LauraCottonTail
<idioterna>	LauraCottonTail: they're not guns.
<idioterna>	they're weapons
<LauraCottonTail>	something lethal
<idioterna>	they made them
<LauraCottonTail>	that shoots bullets
<SimenOlai>	define bullets
<LauraCottonTail>	something lethal
<Romance>	i heard people can kill with pillow as well
<idioterna>	if you want to teach kids to behave, you have to show them you trust them
<SimenOlai>	explain lethal
<H2O1>	most shooting sprays that you hear about are false flags
<LauraCottonTail>	a small projectile that can kill people
<mchelen1>	yeah kids should not be shooting an actual firearm
<idioterna>	so they don't go insane when you're not around
<mchelen1>	way too dangerous
<idioterna>	i agree
<LauraCottonTail>	simenolai that i can't help you with
<idioterna>	i was introduced when i was 15
<idioterna>	all my family were hunters
<idioterna>	horrible stuff
<mchelen1>	afaik if you keep a gun in the house though, its important to show it to them (unloaded!) so they know it is dangerous and don't get curious
<idioterna>	killing cute furry animals
<mchelen1>	(not that i think having guns in the home is a good idea)
<SimenOlai>	I've only used a air rifle
<idioterna>	for what i still think is mostly sport
<idioterna>	because we sure as hell didn't like the meat
<LauraCottonTail>	idioterna yeah but you're from a poor country you get a free pass
<idioterna>	LauraCottonTail: where?
<mchelen1>	yeah hunting is lame unless you are actually eating the animal
<LauraCottonTail>	slovenia?
<idioterna>	free pass to where?
<Romance>	i heard killing animal is a sport in slovenia
<LauraCottonTail>	free pass for being a caveman gun owner
<idioterna>	oh
<idioterna>	no actually it's quite expensive
<LauraCottonTail>	;)
<mchelen1>	Romance: it is pretty much everywhere :(
<idioterna>	and you need to go through a medical, psychological and technical exam
<idioterna>	before they let you buy or keep guns
<idioterna>	oh and the police come to your house and check if you're storing them right
<LauraCottonTail>	oh ok
<idioterna>	it's not too bad
<LauraCottonTail>	i'm hungry
<idioterna>	they do have to be in a locked metal cabinet
<H2O1>	why do you need a gun anyway?
<idioterna>	with keys out of reach of children
<idioterna>	or something like that
<Romance>	mchelen1: they should kill insects, that i will definitely join the sport, i hate mosquito and flies
<idioterna>	Romance: with lasers!
<SimenOlai>	Guess how much highway there is in Norway
<H2O1>	computer directed lasers!
<idioterna>	dunno
<Romance>	idioterna: no fun, i want to punch em and grind em
<LauraCottonTail>	gross
<idioterna>	we have about 800km
<idioterna>	i think
<SimenOlai>	875km
<idioterna>	wow we have the same
<idioterna>	we had 676km of highways and 92km of motorways in 2012
<SimenOlai>	whats the difference between highway motorway freeway
<idioterna>	highways have a shoulder lane where you can stop in an emergency
<SimenOlai_Mobile>	http://imgur.com/dTeIw9G
<SimenOlai>	blue is highway/motorway
<idioterna>	https://www.google.com/maps?q=slovenia
<idioterna>	you can see the yellow roads that are highways.
<idioterna>	and the thinner yellow roads that are motorways
<idioterna>	and single pixel yellow ones are regional roads
<idioterna>	with just one lane each way and a white stripe separating them
<idioterna>	they were insanely expensive to build
<idioterna>	i wish we invested in serious railroads instead
<silverdust>	Anyone knows a online app for creating an agreement with a space for both parties to make their signatures and what the agreement is meant for
<silverdust>	?
<SimenOlai_Mobile>	http://imgur.com/UbqXtUY
<SimenOlai>	In Norway, a highway bridge collapsed while cars was on it
<SimenOlai>	now the road both ways have been closed the past 4 months
<SimenOlai>	what the fuck phone, your sensors are fucking up

<Time-Warp>	flipapy: what if emptyness of space was bright insted of dark
<Time-Warp>	with no source
<flipapy>	time then it wouldnt be empty, its filed with light
<flipapy>	but if all readings say empty and you see only light, you're looking into the lense through the negative setting
<flipapy>	if my readings said empty, and my lense was correctly posed, i would think i am in the presence of some thing unknown

<AdNauseaum2>	an ancient samurai once said it
<AdNauseaum2>	his name was jaden smith
<AdNauseaum2>	and he was very wise beyond his years
<hmir>	I heard that movie was rubbish. Now I know why!
<AdNauseaum2>	jaden smith is a person not a movie
<CHVNX>	He is not a person, he is a thetan.
<AdNauseaum2>	racist
<hmir>	He was in a movie.
<hmir>	He said that in a movie.
<funkentelechrxp>	ok someone that has a good understanding of house electrical systems. I'm replacing a ceiling fan which I thought was bad (probably wasn't. In the ceiling wiring I get 120v measuring from hot to neutral. But I've tried three different ceiling fans and none of them will work. Can't make sense of it.
<hmir>	I presume.
<AdNauseaum2>	he didnt say that in a movie
<AdNauseaum2>	you presume wrong
<AdNauseaum2>	he also drinks water
<AdNauseaum2>	and wears clothes
<AdNauseaum2>	whats your point
<t0fu|work>	did you turn the power back on?
<CHVNX>	funkentelechrxp: hire an electrician
<Shatterer123>	"someone who has a good understanding of house electrical systems"
<AdNauseaum2>	the only knowledge you will find here is about video games an anime from the neckbeard virgins that reside here
<funkentelechrxp>	heh
<AdNauseaum2>	if that doesn't get to you, bingzhangbong will ban you most likely
<AdNauseaum2>	just on the basis that you're alive
<hmir>	You're saying he didn't say that rubbish in the karate kid?
<funkentelechrxp>	my only remaining theory is that either the hot or neutral wire is broken close to the fan, but is still intact enough to get a low current 120v signal. it must drop to 0 with a load.
<t0fu|work>	everything grounded properly?
<funkentelechrxp>	yeah.
<funkentelechrxp>	probably a rat chewed through the wire and exploded in the attic
<t0fu|work>	lights work?

<idioterna>	http://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article20191164.html
<funkentelechrxp>	every other circuit in the house works fine. i just cant get a ceiling fan to operate on that particular ceiling fan wiring
<t0fu|work>	do the lights on the fan work?
<funkentelechrxp>	no
<funkentelechrxp>	the fan/fan light acts like its completely dead
<funkentelechrxp>	but my fluke 115 says 120v measured from hot to neutral
<CHVNX>	funkentelechrxp: hire an electrician
<t0fu|work>	^
<t0fu|work>	you got something fubar'd
<funkentelechrxp>	keep in mind there was already a ceiling fan up there working fine before today. it just up and died, hence the replacement fan. but i think a wire is screwed now.
<funkentelechrxp>	ill probably just cover the ceiling hole and forget about it. im not going to rerun wire in the attic and definitely not going to give an eletrician my life savings
<AdNauseaum2>	no he didnt say that in karate kid
<AdNauseaum2>	he said that on twitter
<sheep>	a reputable electrician wouldn't cost that much
<hmir>	Oh...
<hmir>	It's still rubbish.
<AdNauseaum2>	think about it
<AdNauseaum2>	why in the wild fuck would he say that... in the karate kid
<funkentelechrxp>	heh...electricians charge over $200 just to come to your house. if you make one crawl in an attic and get dirty, they'll go up to 4 figures.
<AdNauseaum2>	like how is that even relevant, let alone sensible
<sheep>	maybe in your market
<Symantic>	i do datacom and low voltage wiring, fk attics.
<funkentelechrxp>	yeah...attics suck. especially when filled with blown-in insulation that's a foot deep
<Symantic>	i really only do commercial stuff, so i get drop ceilings most the time.
<Symantic>	:P
<hmir>	AdNauseaum2: You said samurai yada yada. I knew he had been in some karate movie.
<funkentelechrxp>	i used to run cat5 for department stores
<hmir>	I put two and two together.
<funkentelechrxp>	drop ceilings are much better
<mchelen1>	i once dropped a ceiling
<mchelen1>	i told them i wasn't load bearing
<Symantic>	aye funkentelechrxp. i do alot of department stores
<AdNauseaum2>	samurais do karate?
<sheep>	yeah, since those are actually made for modifying things
<Symantic>	i want my next house to have drop ceilings.
<hmir>	I wasn't sure it was karate kid the movie. I had to google that.
<funkentelechrxp>	same. drop ceilings are awesome
<hmir>	They are close enough for those of us that aren't pedants.
<funkentelechrxp>	especially when you've got pipes supported so well you can crawl and hang on them
<Symantic>	my parents house had drop ceilings down stairs. was awesome.
<Symantic>	still tall clearance.
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<AdNauseaum2>	calling me a pedant for being confused that you think samurais practice karate
<AdNauseaum2>	aite bruh
*	Time-Warp pokes Symantic with a large stick
<Time-Warp>	0_o
*	AdNauseaum2 pokes ye mum with a large duck
*	doge takes the duck away
<Time-Warp>	LOL oh snap
<AdNauseaum2>	RIP doge ate duck
<Time-Warp>	LOL
*	doge bites Ducky
<AdNauseaum2>	my girlfriend calls our dog "doge" and i hate it
<AdNauseaum2>	and when she curls up into a ball to sleep, she calls her a "dogenut"
<doge>	lol
<AdNauseaum2>	thinking about stabbing both of them in their sleep
<Time-Warp>	that duck didnt even know what hit him. nom nom nom
<AdNauseaum2>	why does it have to be a male duck?
<AdNauseaum2>	you fucking opressive piece of shit
<AdNauseaum2>	im triggered
<AdNauseaum2>	fuck the patriarchy
<AdNauseaum2>	im so triggered right now
<doge>	o.o
<AnTi_MTtr>	hair triggered?
<Time-Warp>	AnTi_MTtr: have you ever worked with load balancers in a network before
<hmir>	KKK!
<AnTi_MTtr>	yes
<Time-Warp>	what the heck do they do
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<Shatterer123>	AdNauseaum2, not sure if serious.
<AnTi_MTtr>	they try to evenly split one large chunk of traffic into two
<AnTi_MTtr>	2x many cpus working on the traffic increases efficiency
<AnTi_MTtr>	also they can be used as redundancy
<AnTi_MTtr>	theres different implementations of it
<Time-Warp>	AnTi_MTtr: oh sweet. so its kind of like irc splitting one server to many different servers across the network
<AdNauseaum2>	i apologize, i have stage 4 terminal autism
<Time-Warp>	AdNauseaum2: LOL
<hmir>	That explains a lot!
<AdNauseaum2>	the doc's say i aint got much time left

<Time-Warp>	omg this is so cool

<Time-Warp>	or 5 next time
<Time-Warp>	then we can see hold up
*	ChanServ gives voice to Time-Warp
<mchelen1>	i see it does check if the instances are online/working
<mchelen1>	balancing seems to be based on incoming network traffic
<jjs999jjs>	Barca and Messi 2-0
<mchelen1>	oh it also does elastic scaling (spinning up/down of additional instances)
<Time-Warp>	:D
<hmir>	jjs999jjs; I was hoping for a 0-0.
<hmir>	=(
<jjs999jjs>	me too to win £180
<jjs999jjs>	instead I will win £18

<Fowler>	All loose and lazy?
<treefiddy_>	Equinoxdawg: cause he announced it
<penguin1263>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCRPUv8V22o

<Error418>	Take out the NBA there, I'm all good. :P
<DN-boards1>	error: what?
<sheep>	this is unsurprising
<Fowler>	But it's like, thumbs up is supposed to say, "Yeah! Good job! I like that!"
<Fowler>	But then some people give unenthusiastic thumbs ups
<Equinoxdawg>	treefiddy_: ah
<treefiddy_>	Fowler: i cant thumbs up after seeing some movie from the 80's where they rode motorcycles that shot rockets and stuff.
<bazhang>	ocd detected
<Time-Warp>	DUDE did you guys know you can use load balancers to impact call flow. like if one call center gets to many trolls calling it will send it to another call center
<treefiddy_>	and they all continually gave each other the thumb
<ssquirrel>	...
<ssquirrel>	seas1.org
<Fowler>	treefiddy_: I thought you were going to say you broke your thumbs after thumbsing up too hard
<Error418>	Fowler: I never thumb up unless it's sarcastically.
<treefiddy_>	Fowler: haha no. it just killed it. i wish i could remember the movie
<DN-boards1>	ALSO
<DN-boards1>	what happened to defocus
<treefiddy_>	and the final battle was won by them jumping over something
<treefiddy_>	it was 80's cheese
<Fowler>	The shark?
<ssquirrel>	bleh... call center yeah ... freakin shark
<ssquirrel>	you have to take a minimum number of calls that hold your attention
<treefiddy_>	i'll see if i can dig it up. i have few details to anchor off of
<ssquirrel>	not trolls
<Error418>	I'd do a call center job, as long as it's not marketing.

<FreezingCold>	Romance: meh, you can stay awake easily on it.
<FreezingCold>	if you want to
<Romance>	i had enough of being awaken, somebody put me on sleep now!
<FreezingCold>	it probably takes me ~5 minutes to fall asleep with 7.5mg of zopiclone. If I take it a few days in a row, then I need 15mg.
<FreezingCold>	If I space it out, then 3.75mg is enough.
<Romance>	FreezingCold: is it soluble
<FreezingCold>	are you planning on using it as a date rape drug?
<Romance>	ew thats gross
<Romance>	i just prefer liquid
<FreezingCold>	you're an adult, it's a tiny pill
<Romance>	i will try it, hopefully theres one in a pharmacy nearby
<FreezingCold>	it's prescription.
<Romance>	what will they check on me? my previous insomnia report?
<FreezingCold>	Um, I don't even know what country you're from.
<FreezingCold>	Anyway, look how tiny they are.
<FreezingCold>	https://i.imgur.com/ylvZJdv.jpg
<FreezingCold>	you can see each pixel on my screen lol.
<FreezingCold>	And that's a very high DPI screen too.
<FreezingCold>	like >300 ppi.
<FreezingCold>	Romance: anyway, you don't really have much choice. Ask for temporary sleep meds from your doctor, take what you can get.
<FreezingCold>	and whatever you do, don't say it's because of stress or some bullshit.
<FreezingCold>	Say you can't control it and it's affecting your daily life.
*	coldsparrow sleeps well.
<Romance>	insomnia is not common in Malaysia, its a rare case. most of Malaysians can sleep well. dammit :(
<coldsparrow>	Romance, you're in malaysia now?
<FreezingCold>	insomnia is common world wide, I doubt location has much to do with it.
<Romance>	yes
<Romance>	i tried to force my eyes to sleep but ended up hurting my eyes
<FreezingCold>	apparently in Malaysia you can get prescriptions drugs illegally pretty easily.
<FreezingCold>	Er, how old are you...?
<Romance>	im 29
<FreezingCold>	If you're under 18, do not take these drugs.
<FreezingCold>	oh.
<FreezingCold>	meh.
<forks>	mexico is pretty good too
<forks>	but vietnam i hear is the best
<Romance>	mexico is pretty dangerous, they mostly put someone to sleep forever by shooting
<forks>	just go up to the pharmacy and ask for whatever
<FreezingCold>	na, just stick to the popular places.
<FreezingCold>	forks: in Canada it's easy to get drugs, but if you get caught the punishment is pretty harsh (ish).
<Romance>	how about some therapy? maybe yoga ?
<FreezingCold>	Romance: uh, if you can avoid prescription drugs, avoid them.
<FreezingCold>	No question about that.
<Romance>	yeah its the last resort beside i prefer soluble drugs.
<Error418>	prescription drugs are great!
*	Error418 ticks randomly. 
<Romance>	there must be something else which is safe to treat insomnia
<FreezingCold>	Again, if you aren't willing to swallow a tiny pill, your sleeping issues are hardly enough to warrant prescription drugs.
<FreezingCold>	I would probably be willing to have a finger cut off if it meant I would be able to sleep properly.
<FreezingCold>	A tiny pill? Not even a question.
<sunstar>	you should down a bunch of nyquil gelcaps
<Error418>	Melatonin?
<FreezingCold>	Error418: I take that every day, mostly because I tend to keep the lights on pretty late.
<coldsparrow>	chew some velarium root and call me in the morning.
<FreezingCold>	I can work on my computer, take a few 30 minutes before bed, and fall asleep right away with zopiclone (5 minutes before).
<FreezingCold>	Zopiclone does make you forget things. I had an incident once where I was up until 8am and didn't remember a thing I said.
<FreezingCold>	I briefly chatted with nobody on Facebook.
<FreezingCold>	I looked at the logs a few weeks later and went "wtf was this"
*	forks_ is now known as forks
<FreezingCold>	So there's definite downsides to drugs.
<FreezingCold>	anyway Romance, I don't think your problems are that bad.
<Romance>	FreezingCold: yes i just need some rest, like staying away from computer and maybe just go to the river and feel the nature
<Romance>	i really want to do that :(
<coldsparrow>	aaaaa

<diogenese>	Good luck
<TaZeR>	i hate whoever invented capcha
<TaZeR>	stupid shits gotta try 20 times atlaest on every one
<TaZeR>	yea sunstar thats exactly what they all look like to me
<TaZeR>	sometimes they even start moving and floating around
<sunstar>	i think its a bar sign thats not in english
<TaZeR>	when i concentrate too hard
<joze>	captchas while on LSD is an enlightening experience
<TaZeR>	lsd makes me cry for 12 hours
<tortib>	Captcha is a good thing
<tortib>	I don't have to try 20 times to get it to validate, it works the first time every time.  It even has a listen link so you can listen to the actual number or word(s).
<sunstar>	omg so i got through that capcha but i get the feeling that this site isnt gonna send out the confirmation email either
<supferrets>	how do you breath properly Audioburn_work
<sunstar>	tortib,  can you solve that capcha?
<tortib>	sunstar, that link is so damn long I'm not going to bother copying and pasting the two lines into my browser.
<Thete>	hmm
<sunstar>	you dont have to just click it works even though it broke up
<Rat00>	6 times per minute
<TaZeR>	try PRAF RIVAORVIA nf CAMO05
<Rat00>	5times per minute.. or something of the sort.. 12sec per breath
<tortib>	okay that's a tough captcha
<tortib>	but can't you just reload it?
<tortib>	have a new image displayed?
<sunstar>	then i gotta fill out the form again cuz the site sux
<tortib>	lol
<tortib>	what site?
<sunstar>	not telling
<sh4tr>	stalk me
<tortib>	I don't know why they would reload the entire page instead of just using an AJAX call to reload the image itself

<Thete>	win 10 worse than 8
<tortib>	sunstar, it may be the website
<tortib>	sunstar, pm me the domain so I can look into it
<TaZeR>	8.1 is the best windows ever, 10 can never be as good
<TaZeR>	8.1 is the perfect mix of new and old, and its rock solid stable and looks great
<tortib>	OS X 4 LYFE
<TaZeR>	10 looks too flashy like they took the arguably most useless part of 8, the metro stuff and put it all over the desktop
<TaZeR>	windows 8's desktop is atleast nice and not integrated with metro stuff
<Thete>	and slapped Whoretana on it
<TaZeR>	i like metro as an application launcher drawer type thingy the apps though useless
<sunstar>	ad supported crap. trick everybody into upgradeing cuz yknow. it's free.  then bang! its 1984 all over again
<TaZeR>	i never used the old start menu after like windows 98, but the metro start screen got me using it again
<sunstar>	start menu is like #1 mostes important part of any computer
<TaZeR>	heh the last build of win10 i tried the calculator was even a metro app, and took like 5 seconds to launch
<TaZeR>	the wifi network connection pannel same thing
<TaZeR>	metrotised
<TaZeR>	worst thing about those apps that launch with metro api is they take forever to launch
<TaZeR>	looks like its win 8.1 until end of extended support for me
<TaZeR>	maybe ill only use it if needed on my gaming rig if 8.1 doesnt get the latest directx
<sunstar>	ill stick with win7 for a while
<grayC>	fedora4eva
<TaZeR>	fair choice as well but its a little ancient in both looks and under the hood
<sunstar>	8 is cool and all but after a while i just end up taking it off and putting 7 on
<Thete>	Wish game devs would stop using Direct3D
<sunstar>	yeah the more GL the better
<TaZeR>	why?
<sunstar>	better fer linux
<marienz>	I rarely use windows but am more comfortable with the non-metroized ui in 7
<TaZeR>	directx 12 looks really good, it should outperform opengl by a good margin
<marienz>	probably still going to upgrade my gaming OS from 7 to 10 once it's available
<grayC>	yea everyone likes 10
<Rat00>	Using dual boot with win7 with XP skin and Ubuntu 12.04
<TaZeR>	marienz: i dont see any part of windows 8.1 that is metrotised
<Rat00>	need win mostly for gaming..
<TaZeR>	charms bar and stuff can be turned off now
<sunstar>	12.04?
<grayC>	except me ofc
<Rat00>	version 12.04 of ubuntu yes
<TaZeR>	windows 10 is where the metrotising is starting
<marienz>	TaZeR: I could presumably tweak the configuration a bit and get to that state, yes. But my 8.1 install is on a laptop with touchscreen, which is approximately the environment it should work well on, so I figured I should try it
<grayC>	all the gui is going colored tiles bleh
<sunstar>	the pink theme looks really good
<marienz>	(my 7 install is on a desktop, for games)
<grayC>	gnome on 21 giu was like a video game
<Rat00>	same :).
<TaZeR>	i dont know about touch on a computer with a mouse and keyboard, i think it would be counter productive
<sunstar>	i think the main reason i dont like 8 is cuz it runs like shit on my ancient systems
<TaZeR>	i mean a trackpad
<grayC>	8 is no good
<TaZeR>	and if i was forced to use touch it would be in desktop mode anyway
<Rat00>	I don't like the whole cell-phone feel
<marienz>	TaZeR: I do end up using it a bit
<grayC>	me too rat
<sunstar>	i used to work in a pot shop that had nice touchscreens. it was soooo nice being able to just point at something to make it go
<TaZeR>	why is it no good grayC?
<grayC>	8?
<TaZeR>	its superior almost in everyway
<TaZeR>	the sheer under the hood performance improvements are off the scale
<grayC>	i just cant cope w/it ok
<sunstar>	it kills my laptops batteries worse than win7
<Butt3rfly>	lol
<TaZeR>	but with what?
<Rat00>	dislike the touch screen as well.. I am used to the sound of my mechanical G4V2 Steelseries kboard
<TaZeR>	the interface is exactly the same as windows 7 just more polished and refined looks
<Rat00>	and the feel it gives when typing..
<grayC>	yea my m$ experience ended with XP
<sunstar>	keyboard + mouse + touchpad + touchscreen = awesome at work
<grayC>	lovexp
<TaZeR>	windows xp is unstable and buggy my todays standards
<TaZeR>	by todays standards*
<Rat00>	ah.. xp took a while to get there.. sp3 was good
<sunstar>	XP is a rotten wormy apple
<Rat00>	very exploitable
<grayC>	once i movedto linux,i can haveanything i want to look at
<grayC>	stupidspacebar
<TaZeR>	linux is great you can always customize it however you want
<grayC>	yea :)
<Butt3rfly>	lol
<TaZeR>	too bad it doesnt get the recognition it deserves
<sunstar>	i think it does
<TaZeR>	all software and games for pc should be windows/linux cross platform
<grayC>	xp on sp3, no further updates was great
<TaZeR>	i hope the world catches up to this
<hmir>	Games should be banned from all PC platforms!
<Rat00>	no
<Butt3rfly>	xp was great for hackers
<sunstar>	then how will the games be made?
<Rat00>	it was
<Butt3rfly>	so many holes
<grayC>	yea i was always getting corp virii  lol
<hmir>	Games are a waste of time!
<Rat00>	arguable
*	Butt3rfly invites hmir for a game of tiddlywinks
*	hmir declines politely
*	Rat00 feels offended by the choice of game proposed.
<TaZeR>	games will be developed using a controller and kinect
<TaZeR>	new MS tech!
<TaZeR>	with a hololens on top
<TaZeR>	you will just wave your arms where you want the code to appear
<grayC>	win 10 is rumored to be free for home users + free upgrade for all win8 buyers
<TaZeR>	pretty much confirmed
<hmir>	Free windows?
<hmir>	It's about time!
<grayC>	yes
<y0wza>	for the first year i think
<y0wza>	or is it 4ev
<Rat00>	"free" is a relative term
<TaZeR>	free upgrade for win 7 and 8 users, i havnt heard about just free for everyone
<grayC>	who pays for that stuff anyway
<sunstar>	this laptop came with vista. got a free upgrade to win7. then i got a discounted upgrade to win8, free upgrade to 8.1 and now ill get a free upgrade to 10
<hmir>	If you don't play games, and you shouldn't, then windows is quite useless anyway. =o
<grayC>	I don't play games
<hmir>	Good for you!
<Rat00>	windows is still nice for office and some other programming stuff
<grayC>	ikr
<TaZeR>	why is it useless? its a solid OS with great software available for it
<sunstar>	i dont play games cuz you need to spend like $4,000 on a computer before you can think of buying games
<joze>	free as in user is the currency
<hmir>	Yeah, get a console!
<y0wza>	na more like 8000
<grayC>	no consoles here
<TaZeR>	the OS debate is always so crude with people so set in their mostly crazy perceptions
<Butt3rfly>	sunstar, rubbish
<sh4tr>	when autodesk
<Butt3rfly>	I have a top gaming pc and it cost me £300
<Butt3rfly>	self build
<Rat00>	"top?"
<TaZeR>	thats not enough for a top video card alone
<Thete>	You got Quad Titan Extremes in there?
<grayC>	my son has a reasonable gaming pc growing up  and would spend all the tine in the world gaming if id dnt stop him
<hmir>	You can't even get a stand alone top of the line gfx card for 300 pound.
<y0wza>	lmao
<y0wza>	titan extreme is shyt
<Rat00>	top graphics card is way more expensive than 300
<sh4tr>	when autodesk/ if autodesk release for linux windows will be dead
<y0wza>	no 1 shuld get it
<Thete>	GTX Titan X
<y0wza>	shi
<y0wza>	t
<TaZeR>	but you can build a pc for that much that crushes the consoles
<Butt3rfly>	graphics is intergrated into the CPU
<TaZeR>	the consoles really failed with their specs
<hmir>	That's no good for gaming.
<y0wza>	mite as well get 980
<Butt3rfly>	it is
<TaZeR>	next gen, more like previous gen.5
<hmir>	Builtin gfx are not good for running games. They can't handle the load.
<Rat00>	nope
<sunstar>	especially when the crap is CRAP!  medium shelf hardware doesnt even play unreal tournament 2004 smoothly
<Butt3rfly>	hmir, how would you know, you don't game bro
<grayC>	im saving gaming for when im really old
<Rat00>	i would know and he's right
<TaZeR>	you need to game while your young to hone those reflexes and skill
<hmir>	I used to install and run games till about 2 years ago.
<TaZeR>	when your an old fart knocker you wont even remember how to use a mouse in a fps game
<hmir>	I still never sat down and played them, but I wanted to install and check them out.
<grayC>	nah i wannabe counterstrike granny
<hmir>	grayC; Aren't you already raally old?!?!?!!1 =P
<grayC>	lolol not yet
<hmir>	45+ == reaaaaaaaaaallly old!
<TaZeR>	50 is like the new 30 though
<TaZeR>	times have changed
<sunstar>	i used to be like 50 kills with 1 death in fps match. now my neice gets that score while i gots like 39 to 28.  my brain got old and its not fast no more...
<TaZeR>	and 30 is the new 15
<grayC>	70+ = realllly old
<hmir>	Only 50 year olds say stuff like that!
<TaZeR>	30 is like a kid still
<sunstar>	30 is OLD

<TaZeR>	when i was in grade 2 my friend kneed me in the nuts really bad
<hmir>	I got way too much facial hair. I wish I couldn't grow hair.
<TaZeR>	i think they stopped making testostorone
<hmir>	Save me money on razor blades. =\
<forks>	yes, with the power of methamphetamines, you too can trounce children at videogames
<TaZeR>	we were playing power rangers
<Rat00>	buy an actual blade
<hmir>	Meth + games == waste of meth.
<grayC>	that would be the worst thing about being a man, hair growing all over your face
<grayC>	or your BACK
<grayC>	itcan come up anywhere cant it
<Thete>	maybe you're a girl?
<TaZeR>	yea video games are the last thing on my mind on phetrs

<TaZeR>	i go straight for the pornhub
<forks>	hmir, fat men should not, however, wax anything
<grayC>	+everyone knowing when you are horny cuz dick
<hmir>	Fat men should just hit the gym.
<grayC>	women can be horny as hell and no-one knows
<TaZeR>	some women like fat hairy men believe it or not
<Thete>	women typically hornier than men
<forks>	but they should not wax beforehand
<Thete>	I know
<hmir>	Not always true.
<Rat00>	i see your nipples
<Thete>	I can smell it
<hmir>	Their pupils kind of dilate, and their mannerisms change A LOT.
<grayC>	hehe
<Rat00>	they also get that penis in their eyes look
<hmir>	Thete: Sexist!
<Thete>	as if such a thing existed

<y0wza>	penis in their eyes look lmao
<y0wza>	wth
<grayC>	I wouldn't cope with all that clothes

<hmir>	And airy!
<Butt3rfly>	ug, really?
<forks>	kilts
<hmir>	kekeke!
<Thete>	people should be able to just go naked
<forks>	or if you're skinny and a hippy, a sarong can work
<grayC>	girls can wear any kind of mens clothes, why not the other way round
<Butt3rfly>	I don't know any real woman that actually likes wearing dresses
<sunstar>	no i dont wanna see hairy men with a mafrodite
<grayC>	makeup too, slap it on if you want guys
<hmir>	You saying fat people can't wear sarongs?
<forks>	yes
<Thete>	why not?
<forks>	stick to kilts

<Thete>	It's not like you're banging em
<hmir>	Mascara or eyeliner?
<sunstar>	both
<forks>	you look like a storybook eunoch

<hmir>	Doesn't look good on all guys.
<hmir>	It looks much better on more effiminate looking guys.
<grayC>	i dont wear makeup hmir
<sunstar>	with the right application it makes everyone look better
<hmir>	grayC; we're talking about guys wearing makeup!
<forks>	idk, they fuck it up on even men on tv
<forks>	and those are pro makeup people
<grayC>	yea i know im just sayin, girls dont have to
<forks>	they made tom brokaw look like a clown once

<Rat00>	btw.. real man don't shave and those who do, do it with http://i773.photobucket.com/albums/yy20/ambroseshave/IMG_4906.jpg
<forks>	still, it'd be a very careful balancing act
<sunstar>	well maybe you could hide the bulge in some pletes but the hair.... nooo   puke
<grayC>	i can go to town in a suit like a man but here if a man wears a dress hes a target for rape/beating, if he colors his hair, wears makeup
<forks>	do what
<grayC>	it is silly, jus like racism
<forks>	yeah, pretty much the same here
<grayC>	we are not all the same
<forks>	a kilt, unless you do the whole 9 yards thing, would just about get you the same
<forks>	they'd for sure look at you with disgust
*	sunstar looks at outlook.com's offerings

<forks>	i stretched my ears, for a time they were at 5/8th inch

<hhmmm>	mornng
<grayC>	fashion tattooos are out of control here too
<forks>	luckily i went very slowly with it, and now they are closing up nicely
<forks>	looks like a / in my ear
<grayC>	when the nature of fashion is to change, it is stupid
<forks>	i've seen some that look like cat assholes
<forks>	so i'm very lucky
<grayC>	she got a halloween special
<grayC>	how lame is that
<forks>	well... was it some sort of goofy pumpkin or something?
<grayC>	just  moon on her ribs and the boy who paid got charles manson face on his bottom
<grayC>	yolo and all that
<forks>	well the latter is incredibly stupid, but a moon is not so bad
<grayC>	it is alrite for a fashion tattoo
<tortib>	Tattoos are...heh well I don't know there is something different about those people that get tattoos.
<grayC>	she said if she dies i can cut it out and frame it
<sunstar>	i want to get a taurus (perpetual motion) tattoo
<Thete>	why is the latter stupid?
<grayC>	well she said yes when i asked
<tortib>	sunstar, was that gif supposed to make sense?
<tortib>	sunstar, because it sure as hell didn't.
<tortib>	sunstar, meaning, what the hell was that driver thinking?
<sunstar>	they cant drive
<tortib>	People never cease to amaze me
<sunstar>	i've seen people parallel park like that
<forks>	charles manson is a sad and simple (as in retarded) but very manipulative little man
<forks>	true evil? pshaw
*	LarryTheLobster is now known as Larry
<forks>	just a cliche and campy sort of idk... crass?
*	Larry is now known as Guest3024
<Thete>	I think he's interesting
<Thete>	media really liked to make him a monster
<tortib>	Yeah, I know how that goes.
<forks>	he's just that moron that you went to school with except raised in prison, too stupid to get over the evil is cool phase
<tortib>	forks, was that sentence supposed to make sense?
<tortib>	forks, because it sure as hell didn't.
<JessicaJ>	i got it
<Thete>	forks: how you figure?
<forks>	idk, try reading it again, tortib
<JessicaJ>	forks, next time use punctuation.. it helps with longer ones
<JessicaJ>	just sayin
<forks>	yeah
<Thete>	He was used as a pawn to destroy the hippy movement
<tortib>	hey JessicaJ
<JessicaJ>	hey tortib
<tortib>	How are you?
<Thete>	I think he was a willing participant
<grayC>	I do too Thete
<JessicaJ>	tortib, im awesome.. hows yourself?
<tortib>	JessicaJ, I'm okay, can't really complain because nobody gives a shit.
<JessicaJ>	tortib, i care ish :P
<grayC>	people were really down on communes and hippies after that
*	Butt3rfly slaps tortib upside the head
<tortib>	wat
<forks>	i will rephrase: Charles Manson is similar to your average moron which you may have encountered in school, except Manson was raised in prison.  He's simply too stupid to get over the evil-is-cool phase that many young boys experience.
<Thete>	media created the boogie man, they put on some mock show trial to scare the crap out of everyone, pay him a bunch of money
<JessicaJ>	tortib, only thing is complaining doesnt do anything to fix.. just makes ya feel better to rant sometimes
<grayC>	Easyrider too, being a hippie is dangerous :)
<tortib>	forks, How do you know some people didn't consider you a moron that encountered you in school?
<Thete>	he wrote songs for the beach boys
<hhmmm>	oh zimbado has been studying video games and pron
<Thete>	went to boys town
<tortib>	JessicaJ, I complain and attempt to fix at the same time, ya know, multi-tasking.
<grayC>	yea and talked to their manager
<grayC>	who was evil
<JessicaJ>	tortib, at least you give it a shot then
<forks>	tortib, wherever did i suggest that they didn't?
<tortib>	forks, use more words when you type man.
<tortib>	Seriously.
<Thete>	manson is extremely intelligent if you pay attention to any of his videos
<forks>	tortib, i'm afraid that i cannot cater to your lack of reading comprehension any further
<forks>	struggle along as best you can, or don't
<JessicaJ>	lol
<tortib>	forks, It isn't my lack of comprehension, it's your lack of being descriptive and coherent.
<forks>	whatever
<tortib>	\/\/
*	JessicaJ feels the love in the room
<sunstar>	tortib doesnt speak the shorthand
<grayC>	I am not having any trouble reading your typing forks
<JessicaJ>	the chat hand
<tortib>	Well I shouldn't have to cater to morons.
<forks>	it's as though you can't converse, tortib
<JessicaJ>	i had to read it a couple times but i did understand mostly :P
<hhmmm>	nonesense tho
<tortib>	forks, I'm extremely capable of conversing.
<tortib>	forks, I know big words are hard for you though, it's okay.
<forks>	you said "<tortib> forks, How do you know some people didn't consider you a moron that encountered you in school?" and i said "<forks> tortib, wherever did i suggest that they didn't?"
<forks>	i'm afraid i can't be any more clear
<tortib>	wherever wasn't the proper word to use...
<tortib>	Whenever would have been more suiting.
<forks>	no
<boz>	yes!
<boz>	no!
<boz>	bismillah!
<Rat00>	maybe so
<JessicaJ>	haha.. reminds me of being in ##english
<hhmmm>	but
<forks>	this is text, where is apt
<Rat00>	could it be that your love.. is meant for me... maybe so, maybe nooooo ooooo
<hhmmm>	all you canadians better stop talking about bombs now
<Rat00>	wow there
<Rat00>	now you're pushing it
<Rat00>	my brain is utterly confused
<forks>	wherever in the body of the text that i have written did i suggest to you, tortib, that i am not such a moron as i mention in my previous statements regarding Charles Manson?
<hhmmm>	butt
<joze>	like
<tortib>	forks, you're terrible.
<forks>	i'm comfortable with regarding myself as a moron
<tortib>	You try to sound more intelligent than you are.
<tortib>	By trying to use different sentence structure than most people use.
<JessicaJ>	laterz ppl persons
<forks>	you haven't the slightest inkling of my capacities, who then is being forward?
<sunstar>	or thats just how he talkses?
<hhmmm>	bye JessicaJ
<tortib>	sunstar, it could be, but damn he needs practice.
<JessicaJ>	hi/bye hhmmm
<forks>	tortib, you are the only person, in many years of chatting here on freenode, which has expressed such problems with understanding what i say
<forks>	at least as far as i can recall
<sunstar>	finally! a confirmation email
<tortib>	forks, maybe nobody has told you before because they don't give a shit enough, has that ever crossed your mind?
<anonken18>	Is it allowed to talk about legal herbs here?
<Rat00>	can I be the 2nd person to do the same?
<Rat00>	do I get the candy/
<forks>	do you care so much about me, is that what this is?
<tortib>	forks, I'm trying to educate you.
<grayC>	why is tortib still attacking forks
<tortib>	forks, You need schooling.
*	grayC starts crying
<forks>	grayC, because i am feeding a troll
<sunstar>	why is that so difficult? every website makes u sign up and verify email b4 use, wtf is up with them not sending out the verification email?
<forks>	i'm bored so, meh
<tortib>	I'm not a troll.
<Equinoxdawg>	tortib: you're giving out free teaching? where do I sign up?
<forks>	no, no, perish the thought
<tortib>	When someone says something negative towards you all of a sudden they're a troll?
<sunstar>	anonken18,  yes. so is #r.trees
<tortib>	Equinoxdawg, Yes, free teachings for a fee of $5000.
<grayC>	1 box of headless beetroot = $5
<forks>	you're just criticizing something as meaningless as someone's conversational style on irc, tortib
<forks>	or do you genuinely care?
<forks>	rofl!
*	Equinoxdawg was looking forward to learning the difference between your and you're :(
<tortib>	forks, nah just bored really.
<grayC>	boil the beetroot in hot water with vinegar and what spices you like, simmer till soft
<tortib>	Equinoxdawg, lol
<forks>	eugh, beets
<anonken18>	K. I was just wondering if anyone took Kratom. I only use it for my anxiety. It completely wipes it out.
<grayC>	i love red beetroot
<boz>	forks: tell him: "come at me bro"
<Butt3rfly>	lol
<forks>	boz, never

<forks>	i come from the ancient and true school of trolls, we do not lower ourselves to such feeble memery
<tortib>	lol reminds me of that ram hitting the punching bag and it swinging back and hitting him and then the ram goes completely ape shit on it.
<tortib>	Best gif ever.
<Butt3rfly>	pics or it never happened
<forks>	most of those whom people call trolls these days are simply assholes
<tortib>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVCR29aE_OQ
<boz>	forks: because the meaning's been lost
<tortib>	Butt3rfly, Told ya it happened.
<idioterna>	people call me a troll when i make a valid point that makes them feel insecure about their beliefs
<tortib>	Butt3rfly, would I lie?
<tortib>	idioterna, Yeah, I get that a lot as well.
<tortib>	idioterna, that's people for ya though.
<Butt3rfly>	lol tortib
<tortib>	idioterna, gods like us, ya know, we have it different.
<forks>	though i must say, i look forward to being further educated by you, tortib
<tortib>	forks, I look forward to teaching you.
<forks>	try it m8
<tortib>	Butt3rfly, captions > http://giphy.com/gifs/lol-punching-bag-u-wot-m8-mAf60cr3EFPna
<Butt3rfly>	that was so cute torib, captions not nessessary
<tortib>	the captions make it soooo much better D:
<idioterna>	forks: say you have a piece of iron rail that's 1000m long, fastened to the ground at each end
<hmir>	Anyone else watchin The Returned?
<hmir>	It's really good!
<idioterna>	forks: and then it heats up and extends by 0.05%, so 0.5m
<hmir>	Kind of reminds me just a very tiny little bit of Lynch but in a horror context.
<idioterna>	forks: how much would you say it shifts when it curves?
<forks>	idioterna, i have a piece of iron rail that's 1000m long, fastened to the ground at each end
<Thete>	What's causing it to heat up?
<Thete>	cause that a big ass piece of iron
<forks>	idioterna, i would not say
<idioterna>	i don't think that's relevant, but in practice it's usually the sun
<tortib>	Volcanos are heating it up
<forks>	idioterna, what if the iron rail does not bend, but the universe itself distorts around it?
<hmir>	Time for some gangsta shit! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ME3K3m3U-Q
<idioterna>	the point of this is that it's not intuitive
<idioterna>	i have an even harder problem if you're into that sort of stuff
<forks>	good, i have been told that i have zero intuition
<idioterna>	forks: so, how much would you estimate the bend shifts the rail from its original position in the middle?
<forks>	i wouldn't estimate
<forks>	i would measure
<idioterna>	cool
<forks>	or hire an engineer
<idioterna>	so you're not really looking forward to learn
<tortib>	If you have so much intuition why are you hiring an engineer?
<forks>	"good, i have been told that i have zero intuition"
<forks>	seriously, reading comprehension
<forks>	work on it
<tortib>	And you believe what others tell you?
<forks>	at times, especially when it aligns with my own experiences
<idioterna>	i have a lot of intuition, but i also know how to calculate this
<tortib>	forks, my reading comprehension is pretty damn good.
<forks>	really, belief is all that i have
<tortib>	forks, I fully understand what I have gotten myself into, do you?
<forks>	that does not align with my own experiences
<forks>	have you ever read the tales of unlce remus?
<tortib>	No.
<DoverMo>	i am uncle remus
<forks>	of special note might be the tale of br'er rabbit and the tar baby
<DoverMo>	brrrrr'rr'rrr'rr'er rabbit
<hmir>	Uncle remus must die.
<DoverMo>	everyone loves uncle remus
<DoverMo>	NOO
<DoverMo>	hmir, uncle remus is your god
<idioterna>	so, we have a pot of boiling water at 100C and an evacuated jar with a valve, submerged into the boiling water
<Rat00>	the only remus I know are the exhaust pipes for cars
<grayC>	have you heard Reso music rat?
*	wowwhatamouthfu1 is now known as wowwhatamouthful
<hmir>	I am my own god.
<hhmmm>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKcfrTXD1kc ?
<grayC>	try reso -axiom
<hmir>	Uncle remus can suck a tail pipe!
<idioterna>	how much of the jar's volume is filled with boiling water and how much with stream when the pressure equalizes?
<forks>	tortib, to spell out the allusion to a reference you have made clear you would not get:  you are the troll, the rabbit, and i am the tar baby.  when you punch me, i do not let go, if it angers you and you kick, i will not let go
<DoverMo>	wow
<hmir>	Carbon monoxide poisoning is a good way to go!
<DoverMo>	idioterna, go to ##physics?
<forks>	eventually i will consume and suffocate you
<idioterna>	DoverMo: forks is trying to learn a few things
<idioterna>	DoverMo: i wouldn't want to overwhelm him
<DoverMo>	hmm
<tortib>	forks, go fuck yourself.
<Butt3rfly>	now now
<idioterna>	mind your manners
<Butt3rfly>	lets keep it civil
<forks>	to quote marilyn manson, "i will bury your god in my warm spit"
<hmir>	He only has like one good album.
<grayC>	reso?
<hmir>	Or maybe two. The first two.
<forks>	sad but true
<DoverMo>	but he looooks cool
<idioterna>	as long as he pisses off the conservative right, i'm happy
<grayC>	i snagged 4 tracks from radio the other day
<hmir>	He looks awful.
<DoverMo>	hmir, not if he played metal
<forks>	every time he is interviewed i find myself respecting him more and more
<hmir>	He looks awful regardless of what he played.
<forks>	but his music does seem to decline
<grayC>	this one dj seems to like exactly the kind of music i do and they are all from youtube <3
<hmir>	Real musicians don't need theatrics.
<grayC>	its just background
<hhmmm>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKqZZg2U6t4
<DoverMo>	hmir, hell no, style is cool
<grayC>	i dont like music that forces you to listen to it
<tortib>	forks, you're a heathen, you're a worm.
<DoverMo>	eat a bat
<tortib>	forks, You believe in false prophets
<hmir>	grayC; music that makes you think? =P
<grayC>	yes its good
<forks>	prick your finger it is done, the moon has now eclipsed the sun, the worm has spread its wings, the time has come for greater things
<forks>	i play with misremembered lyrics
<forks>	tortib, the only thing i can really say i devote myself to is doubt
<tortib>	forks, yeah but you like marlin manson...
<grayC>	i thought i cant hear you- jack white band was i can heal you
<grayC>	so sexy song
<treefiddy_>	wat

<Butt3rfly>	https://youtu.be/gXhHwOA15z4 best lyrics ever, lol
<hmir>	Death!
<tortib>	forks, it has absolutely nothing to do with rationality, it's all about power.
<DoverMo>	tortib, why
<tortib>	forks, and you're powerless.
<forks>	what has to do with power? doubt?
<grayC>	this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zj7jTtyCmOU
<forks>	i doubt your statement of my powerlessness
<tortib>	forks, no I'm speaking about rationality.
<DoverMo>	i have the power
<tortib>	You think people in power care about being rational?
<tortib>	I have Nintendo Power!
<forks>	i do not care
<treefiddy_>	they care about rations
<tortib>	and the power glove
<treefiddy_>	i care about rations
<tortib>	treefiddy_, yeah, their rations lol
<DoverMo>	tortib, if you consider killing your highest ranking officers as rational...
<treefiddy_>	chow man
<treefiddy_>	i love chow
<tortib>	DoverMo, When did I kill my highest ranking officers?  I don't know what you're talking about.
<DoverMo>	tortib, north korea
<treefiddy_>	no
<forks>	people in power's power over me extends only so far as their ability to impact my experiences, their notions regarding my doubt and subsequent reasoning over what i have doubted matter little
<DoverMo>	best place to live
<tortib>	DoverMo, what does this have to do with North Korea?
<DoverMo>	tortib, kim killed his officers
<DoverMo>	recently
<tortib>	DoverMo, oh shit, I didn't know that.
<DoverMo>	some of them
<tortib>	why the hell would he do that?
<DoverMo>	cuz they questioned his opinion

<forks>	he was mad 16 people escaped the country on his birthday as well
<treefiddy_>	if you know what i mean. and i think you do

<kline>	surf2b1: what harms he doing?
<surf2b1>	kline: nothing that I know of, but I live in a gated community. Never seen him before and I don't know if it's his car.

<kline>	i dont like to see protestors, does that mean they shouldnt be allowed on the streets?
<kline>	this world isnt about what you do and dont like to see
<treefiddy_>	they aren't supposed to be in the streets
<treefiddy_>	unless they have a permit
<treefiddy_>	otherwise they need to be on sidewalks
<sunstar>	yes it is. its a gated community and thats how those snobs are.
<surf2b1>	pretty sure walking around with no pants on is breaking some law in California. Although in NY ladies can go topless anywhere
<treefiddy_>	in the us, that's a sex crime
<treefiddy_>	and he'd end up on a website
<wowwhatamouthful>	can someone explain to me how equity works for shareholders
<kline>	treefiddy_: what law is that?
<wowwhatamouthful>	what are the benefits
<treefiddy_>	megans law
<kline>	surf2b1: pretty sure being pantsless is not a crime
<treefiddy_>	indecent exposure
<sunstar>	i had to chop down an american flag because my neighbors didnt like it and its a gated community so i had to chop down the flag
<treefiddy_>	rubbing naked parts on a car is a crime
<kline>	treefiddy_: hes just pantsless
<treefiddy_>	i understood he was not only pantsless, but was rubbing wood on the car
<sunstar>	what he said was lewd and could land him in jail kline
<treefiddy_>	wood meaning... you know
<treefiddy_>	rubbing himself on the car
<surf2b1>	that was his words... I didn't stare long enough to see if he was actually rubbing his "wood" on the car.
<surf2b1>	haha
<kline>	sunstar: innnuedos never put anyone in jail
<treefiddy_>	and you shouldnt
<sunstar>	wanna bet?
<kline>	sure
<kline>	i bet he isnt convicted
<sunstar>	lewd conduct has gotten many people jailed
<treefiddy_>	internet bucks?
<kline>	treefiddy_: about 3.50
<treefiddy_>	aww yisss
<treefiddy_>	thousand needles... a zone in WoW
<treefiddy_>	yes im one of those nerds

*	Romance greece....
<treefiddy_>	is the word it's the word it's a mood it's a feeling
<idioterna>	if god wanted us to be naked, we'd have been born that way
<treefiddy_>	biology made us naked
<Romance>	thats why i hate human's law, they prohibit us from being naked
<Romance>	we must follow God's law
<treefiddy_>	not even that
<treefiddy_>	just... ew no
<treefiddy_>	although
<treefiddy_>	nm. i know the answer
<Thete>	why not?
<Thete>	what's eww?
<idioterna>	Romance: where can i read up on god's law?
<Thete>	god law pretty much nature, without the influence of man law
<idioterna>	oh
<idioterna>	so basically anarchy
<idioterna>	that does sound nice, but i'm not sure we're quite ready to embrace it
<dw1>	god's law is love, then the further you get the more laws there are
<dw1>	10 commandments, 100 laws of moses, then all the other laws we have
<dw1>	:)
<dw1>	619 laws of moses*
<idioterna>	dw1: no those aren't god's laws
<dw1>	but yeah, if you act in the highest position its basically anarchy except for one difference
<idioterna>	some random people made them up
<dw1>	if you sin you get snared by the lower positions :p
<dw1>	only the loving and faithful are free
<idioterna>	really?
<idioterna>	how can you tell?
<dw1>	you can do what jesus did in court
<dw1>	and be free
<dw1>	hehe
<idioterna>	but that has nothing to do with god
<dw1>	testimonies, experience
<dw1>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<dw1>	the god position is 'not of the world'
<dw1>	it's not a legal position
<dw1>	it's absence of a legal position :)
<idioterna>	yeah i read about this bar in texas
*	hmir waits for one of the ops to chime in with a ##religion
<dw1>	"my strength is made perfect in weakness"
<dw1>	hehe
<idioterna>	the local church held prayers in front of the bar and then the lightning struck the bar and burned it to the ground
<idioterna>	so the bar owner sued the church
<dw1>	and the darkness comprehended it not
<idioterna>	and the judge said how interesting it is that the bar owner's position seems to be that god is real, but the church claims that's nonsense
<pikaren>	why do i want to fap every now and then
<dw1>	testosterone
<pikaren>	yeh

<Sabotender>	sheesh
<Sabotender>	It was a big ol pain to compile textual for Yosemite
<paper_kitten>	aw...morning :)
<paper_kitten>	Sabotender...why?
<Sabotender>	The github repository didn't even have all of the frameworks in the master file
<paper_kitten>	yeah because it's a paid app
<Sabotender>	I had to download them manually
<paper_kitten>	that's why we use limechat
<Lanceylot>	ello
<paper_kitten>	textual is just an expensive version
<lala>	On the computer, I also use Textual.
<Sabotender>	well you can use it for 'free' if you compile it yourself.  No support is provided when it comes to compiling it (of course). So you are pretty much on your own
<lala>	But I'm usually not on the computer.
<lala>	Sabotender: Why would they open source a paid app?
<Sabotender>	I think its because of the GPL
<Sabotender>	its pretty much beggarware to be honest. If you want to support them, you can buy it from the Appstore.
<paper_kitten>	they do that so they look like heroes while being assholes
<lala>	And they intentionally leave the frameworks out as well?!?!
<Sabotender>	well I think it was an accident to be honest
<Sabotender>	or something wrong with github
<paper_kitten>	anyone on IRC should technically be capable of compiling something and yet they make it a nightmare
<Sabotender>	I had no issues compiling for Mavericks
<Sabotender>	Well, I am not going to lie. It was a nightmare. Lol I had to read though a barrage of errors just to figure out what was going on
<lala>	Oh.
<lala>	I'm still new to compiling.
<foobark>	http://heyyeyaaeyaaaeyaeyaa.com/
<paper_kitten>	and it's not worth it in my mind
<paper_kitten>	limechat is excellent
<lala>	Sabotender: I just use MacPorts.
<bazhang>	most people have no clue about gcc
<bazhang>	they can scarcely set the correct res on their monitor
<lala>	bazhang: I have a clue! It's a compiler.
<sud0>	made by neckbeard stalman
<paper_kitten>	i can scarcely figure out where the fuck to put these zip files from github
<Romance>	theres alternative for gcc if everyone doesnt know how to use it, you can use vlc, its a good media player
<sud0>	paper_kitten: I lost it because I am dumb
<lala>	I don't think git is made for archives.
<paper_kitten>	what, no installer? ok I'll use brew....fuck
<Sabotender>	Well, I am not sure whether or not limechat supports inline images. I like that feature
<lala>	Installers give you the binary files while compilers compile them from source. Right?
<paper_kitten>	if you have the right compiler
<lala>	Sabotender: Sometimes it loads images I don't want to see on this channel.
<paper_kitten>	Sabotender: it does
<Sabotender>	anyway, I am not quite done with my transition from Mavericks to Yosemite, so you may see me pop in and out rarely. I mainly wanted to make sure textual worked in Yosemite. :D
<paper_kitten>	yeah
<lala>	Sabotender: Will you recompile if Textual is updated?
<Sabotender>	lala: not unless its a big update

<lala>	"The team concedes, however, that this finding by itself isn't enough to prove that there's life on Mars."

<CHVNX>	What programs are you using that don't work on linux, or don't have superior linux alternatives?
<Time-Warp>	ANTI LINUX USER IN ROOM !!!
<Time-Warp>	ALERT ALERT
<ceil>	Excel
<ceil>	LO Calc doesn't hold a matchstick, let alone a candle, to Excel
<ceil>	sorry to say
<CHVNX>	ceil: What is it about excel that cannot be done with software on linux?
<ceil>	dem vba macros tho
<NotSmirks>	i dont think linux supports steam
<ceil>	NotSmirks: yes it does
<CHVNX>	NotSmirks: It does.
<SaltyHashes>	Linux doesn't run any windows programs
<Time-Warp>	vba macros lol
<SaltyHashes>	I hate to wine about it though
<NotSmirks>	wine
<CHVNX>	There are well over 1000 steam games that run on Linux.
<ceil>	the library's not quite as extensive as the Windows version, but there are hundreds of games on the linux version
<CHVNX>	NotSmirks: Without wine.
<SaltyHashes>	NotSmirks, ^^
<SaltyHashes>	hate to "wine" about it
<SaltyHashes>	gahh
<Time-Warp>	just download lindows
<Time-Warp>	LOL
<CHVNX>	NotSmirks: Steam literally has their own Linux distribution.  Where is your rock-home located, and what's it like under there?
<SaltyHashes>	mode +stfu SaltyHashes
<ceil>	NotSmirks: http://store.steampowered.com/browse/linux/
<ceil>	note the penguin icons

<ceil>	NotSmirks: you're under fire for being a willfully ignorant prick about it
<hhmmm>	pewpew
<Zyphyer>	One of my Lymph nodes is a lot bigger than the other, it's been like that for a couple of months. Do I have cancer?
<treefiddy_>	linux sucks
<treefiddy_>	i said it
<hhmmm>	gnu rule
<treefiddy_>	if it didn't it'd hold the market share

<treefiddy_>	but it doesnt
<treefiddy_>	so i sux
<hhmmm>	so,
<hhmmm>	who is the best musician in the world?
<CHVNX>	Linux used to suck.  But then 1999 passed and, well... Linux does not suck. It sucks a lot less than everything else that exists.
<CHVNX>	hhmmm: Me, obviously.
<NotSmirks>	hhmmm modern musicians suck
<ceil>	treefiddy_: tell that to web admins and mobile phone makers and router vendors etc
<treefiddy_>	yet

<hhmmm>	dire straits said faggot :o
<hhmmm>	it's taken my home market ;)
<ceil>	because most home users are retarded
<hhmmm>	oooo
<CHVNX>	NotSmirks: You know fuck all about modern music, so perhaps yous houldn't be speaking about it. I assume you make this judgement based on popular music that is played on the radio.  In fact, I bet you can't name 10 compsers that are the top of their genres from a pre-1900 era.
<sud0>	its funny cause u're the most famous person on linux channel, CHVNX
*	hhmmm turns ceil upside-down

<treefiddy_>	know your audience, know how to market your product
<CHVNX>	NotSmirks: No, what was uncecessary is people making sweeping generalizations about something they are so obviously ignorant about.
<treefiddy_>	CHVNX: who cares? irrelevant music is irrelevant
<hhmmm>	is it bieber mr treefiddy_ ?
<CHVNX>	treefiddy_: I care, for lulz. Problem? Come at me, bro.
<NotSmirks>	calm your tits.
<CHVNX>	NotSmirks: Sexist.
<hhmmm>	hey don't call people ignorant
<hhmmm>	that's disrespectful

<n0lan>	Time-Warp: hi
<treefiddy_>	or talking about a topic that has no relevance
<hhmmm>	what really grinds me gears  oo-ar
<sud0>	relevance of a topic is also relative
<ceil>	treefiddy_: who are you to decide what's relevant?

<SaltyHashes>	Doesn't make much sense
<SaltyHashes>	I mean, atheism is the lack of religion

<sunstar>	right but you can lose out on opportunities (like job offers) due to your lack of belief

<flipapy>	yeah, 250 gb aint much
<hhmmm>	success :)
<flipapy>	i wonder... if the comon theme throughout a person's decisions concerning jobs is making people happy, should they consider a career helping people? doctor, engineer, etc tec, just as long as they are helping people they should be 'happy' ?
<bazhang>	gravedigger
<flipapy>	making people happy in the afterlife?

<AnTi_MTtr>	if i paid as much per month as i do for my cable
<bazhang>	happiness for others is simply not obtainable

<hhmmm>	do they live outside?
<grayC>	in and out, at night they are out
<pingfloyd>	what ever happened to training your dog?
<grayC>	my house backs onto parkland that attracts vagrants
<forks>	the ultrasonic thing is training
<hhmmm>	that's not ...
<treefiddy_>	they're barking at dingos, keeping them at bay
<pingfloyd>	I'm talking about being a trainer with them
<pingfloyd>	like reading a book how to do it
<grayC>	so they bark at them and my husband says oh that is was they are supposed to do
<forks>	time is what happened to that, pingfloyd
<grayC>	but every night all night its too much
<treefiddy_>	pingfloyd: tsst
<forks>	we are not all young kids with no school or jobs or responsibilities, so we can't train them all day, day in and day out
<pingfloyd>	that's what a responsible pet owner should be willing to spend time at
<grayC>	they stop when i yell at them
<hhmmm>	i respond to him
<grayC>	they are failry well trained excpet this
<hhmmm>	either go outside with him or just stare at him, depends if i agree it's a good time to bark
<grayC>	its the brown one causing trouble
<hhmmm>	the little bugger
<grayC>	the black one is way dwn the fence line barking all night b ut the brown one sleeps on the porch under my bedroom window and intermittetently joins in the barking from there
<hhmmm>	sounds like it's the black one who needs to calm down
<hhmmm>	does he read the tabloids or something?
<grayC>	no hes a wannabe gangster
<hhmmm>	calm down, people aren't attacking you all the time :p
<grayC>	i tell everyone who comes over, watch out the black one will bite you and they say nawww
<grayC>	shonuff he bites everyone
<pingfloyd>	call animal control
<grayC>	just with his little teeth you know like a love bite
<treefiddy_>	nip
<pingfloyd>	a biting dog on the loose isn't acceptable
<grayC>	ye
<grayC>	hes not on the loose hes in here
<treefiddy_>	but it's in her yard
<grayC>	and i tell everyone first
<pingfloyd>	if they reach into the fence, it's their own damn fault
<grayC>	its just a gang thing, he only has to do it once then he thinks he owns them
<pingfloyd>	maybe the pain will make common sense sink in, but I doubt it.
<DF3D2>	if you have a dog who bites people, it's your fault
<treefiddy_>	you gotta Ceasar those things
<treefiddy_>	tsst
<DF3D2>	unless the dog is attacked
<pingfloyd>	gang thing? I thought you were talking about a dog
<grayC>	he usually does it on their buttocks

<SimenOlai>	If you pee yellow you aint eating right
<cssgirl>	Does it smell like coffee though. That's the real question.
<treefiddy_>	cause the particulates that cause coffee to be black get filtered out into a different process

<DF3D2>	you should be allowed to say it
<duckgoose>	then wuts up with all these phone charges man
<honey>	pepsi?
<flipapy>	really? people arrest you for using a bad word?
<bazhang>	its the world number seller of just about everything
<DF3D2>	now, you should also get your ass kicked
<DF3D2>	but it shouldn't be illegal
<SimenOlai>	did you guys know Blasphemy is allowed in Norway now
<aeonchild>	Free speech also doesn't apply to verbal abuse
<aeonchild>	It's about being able to express opinions
<aeonchild>	Not call people names
<DF3D2>	im drawing a picture of mohammed right now
<SimenOlai>	what if I want to express my onions, aeonchild
<DF3D2>	SimenOlai, oo make some french onion soup
<Time-Warp>	AnTi_MTtr: amazon is getting huge. here providing acceess to there cloud

<flipapy>	bazhang, i heard vietnamese traditional medicine uses onions like a candel to burn and get over a cold, or somehting like that
<AnTi_MTtr>	like their offices?
<flipapy>	and then make some soup
<pingfloyd>	aeonchild: I don't think you understand free speech

<pingfloyd>	aeonchild: it goes both ways, and having a tough skin isn't much of a price for freedom
<aeonchild>	You can be fined for swearing in public here so
<DF3D2>	aeonchild, thats sad
<aeonchild>	muh freedoms
<SimenOlai>	its free speech, not free abuse/worduse
<flipapy>	ok... attacks on a person's individual character are considered violations worth of legal charges i believe, a lawsuit may follow that but unintentional correlations are not really arrestable offenses
<aeonchild>	muh freeze peaches

<flipapy>	right AnTi_MTtr but calling somone a 'n' in public, isnt that false?
<DF3D2>	nigger is just a word
<AnTi_MTtr>	well thats not defaming their character
<bazhang>	if said to someone's face not so brave
<AnTi_MTtr>	thats just a derogatory term

<pingfloyd>	you spread lies about someone and it results in losses for them, you're vulnerable to legal damages.
<flipapy>	eh, i dont think they had insulting race driven opinions to be part of the freedom of speech act in , what was it? 1760? or so? but yeah little things liek bad words and derogatory terms etc, they seem to slide by, but not likely in the work place

<duckgoose>	yea no
<SimenOlai>	every time youre saying no to something, you're saying yes to something else
<AnTi_MTtr>	every time you say maybe to something, you're saying maybe to something else
<flipapy>	not really, if you say yes to something you say no to something else, but if you say no to something, you dont necessarily say yes to something else, just no to that at that time, and perhaps to the opposite or other possible options are also increased action probabilties on your part
<flipapy>	yeah that wsnt very coherent
<flipapy>	but it's not really saying yes to the other when you say no, no is an inaction, yes is an action, the only action is on a yes
<DN-boards1>	can someone invite me to ##anime

<Bouncer>	I'm trying to imagine how much responsibility for "The Internet" anyone gives to a 22yr old. And the answer appears to be.. not a whole hell of a lot.
<LauraCottonTail>	Bouncer:  recline your chair more
<Bouncer>	Noooooo.... I'll end up napping again!
<CHVNX>	Bouncer: There are thousands of young systeam administrators who function and work on the Internet.
<CHVNX>	Define a lot.
<CHVNX>	http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-12311119
<Bouncer>	Oh I dunno... how many of them are writing IETF RFCs? Or responsible for BGP peering tables on Tier 1 routers at CenturyLink or Level 3?  I'm gonna guess... not many. :p
<redpill>	CHVNX: alot: http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html
<redpill>	alot defined :P
<Bouncer>	That's adorable! I'm stealing the eagle-commenting-on-youtube pic
<redpill>	hehehe
<redpill>	whenever someone talks about stealing internet, I always imagine some guy running with arms full of fiber and routers.
<redpill>	or pirates pulling cable from the ocean to resell it
<LurkAshFlake>	lol
<LurkAshFlake>	that boat would be expensive
<redpill>	with eye patches and all
<redpill>	made of wood
<yano>	https://i.imgur.com/dVG60RW.jpg
<LurkAshFlake>	they manly dive 5km without tank and get the cable up

<Bouncer>	Arrrgh! There by fibers off the port bow!
<Bouncer>	by = be
<redpill>	lol
<x2f>	##chat, let's talk about something
<CHVNX>	Ew.
<x2f>	You all know about it, you've all seen it: The character that cannot make up its name: #
<x2f>	Idiotic plebs call it a "hashtag"
*	Audioburn__work is now known as Audioburn
<redpill>	i like hash
<x2f>	especially the lower IQ members of the youngr generation, such as teenagers
<CHVNX>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4b8ktEV4Bg
<CHVNX>	I'm watching a video on hashes.
<x2f>	the high IQ members of the young generation, and cool people, call it "pound sign"
<x2f>	or if you're really cool, the "octothorpe"
<x2f>	musicians call it "sharp"
<CHVNX>	"number symbol"
<x2f>	and all members of the older generation
<x2f>	but i put emphasis on the fact that idiotic kids between the age of 13-18 call it "hashtag" because of twitter
<x2f>	now I don't generalize
<Audioburn>	x2f, what are you on about
<x2f>	there are some damn smart young people out there, prodigies
<Audioburn>	oh
<Audioburn>	heh
<Audioburn>	dude
<Bouncer>	We refer to it as "the tic-tac-toe thingy they put on phones for some odd reason"
<x2f>	some teenagers have been brought up by good parents who make them go outside and don't use twitter all day
<x2f>	now those,  i respect
<Audioburn>	you judge people's intelligence by the language they use for this? "#"
<redpill>	is is really only called the pound sign in the US
<x2f>	but i lose anyone who calls the # symbol a "hashtag" if it's not in the context of twitter
<Audioburn>	i hope this is all in jest
<CHVNX>	  ♪ Tweeterdeeterpeener, twiiter's got your weiner. ♫
<ceil>	Audioburn: dat octothorpe, tho
<Bouncer>	...but then again, "we" also believe in rotary dial phones made out of bakelite and screw your tonal dialling!
<ceil>	x2f: ^5
<Audioburn>	i just had one of the worst stomach aches of my life
<redpill>	to hash something means to dice it up very fine that is what I see when I look at it
<Audioburn>	think i need to see a doctor, just woke up
<ceil>	Audioburn: one of the worst stomach aches of your life *so far*
<Audioburn>	ceil, lol fuck you, but yea
<ceil>	: )
<Audioburn>	that shit was bad man
<x2f>	speaking of the younger generation, twitter, and "hashtag", BTW this is going in bad territory
<x2f>	actually i should stay out of thath topic
<x2f>	talking about youth never ends well
<Audioburn>	it was more than a stomach ache
<ceil>	x2f: they outnumber us D:
<CHVNX>	Have you noticed that chicks in their 20s give out anal, as if it's normal or something?
<zildjian>	Audioburn: you sure it's not your appendix bursting?
<CHVNX>	Shit wasn't like that back in the day.
<ceil>	CHVNX: ew
<zildjian>	Audioburn: get to an ER and get it checked out
<Audioburn>	it transcended into 'my insides are dying'
<ceil>	CHVNX: lol i see what you did there
<x2f>	but i have a societal question
<ceil>	not sure if you do, but i do
<Audioburn>	zildjian, well shit
<x2f>	Why are good youth not excused from "being a stupid youth" even if they are good?
<CHVNX>	I see. I am smarts.
<Audioburn>	zildjian, it doesn't hurt anymore
<ceil>	: )
<swift110-phone>	Hey
<ceil>	zildjian: if he's american, that could turn into a $2500 bill for a stomach ache
<zildjian>	Audioburn: not sure what to tell you.  My appendix burst on me a few years ago and it was a very painful stomach ache. I drove myself to the ER and collapsed in the hallway trying to walk in the door
<zildjian>	ceil: only if he has no insurance or shitty insurance
<CHVNX>	Death vs $2500
<redpill>	lets just all agree to call it the preprocessor directive sign!
<ceil>	CHVNX: decisions, decisions...
<zildjian>	Audioburn: yeah if you're american, disregard what I'm saying
<Audioburn>	zildjian, jesus man
<ceil>	redpill: silly programmer : )
<Audioburn>	zildjian, I'm american, but why disregard?
<Audioburn>	oh
<Audioburn>	yea I have no insurance
<zildjian>	Audioburn: I don't want to you to have a $100,000 bill based on my advice lol
<Audioburn>	right
<CHVNX>	Americans always disagree. For example, they disagree with logic and rationality quite often.
<Audioburn>	i should be on my parents insurance but ikind of ran away
<ceil>	it is known
<x2f>	I digress
<CHVNX>	Sounds illegal.
<ceil>	only if you file taxes

<CHVNX>	I filed my taxes less than 48 hours ago.
<Audioburn>	CHVNX, quarterly?
<CHVNX>	Wait, no, more like 50 hours ago.
<Audioburn>	and what sounds illegal btw?

<ceil>	Audioburn: t's illegal to not have insurance in the US
<ceil>	o/
<Audioburn>	CHVNX, yea man they couldn't verify my identity when i tried to sign up
<Audioburn>	It's some bullshit dude, really fucked up situation, there's a lot of things wrong
<zildjian>	being illegal is even better
<ceil>	livin' on the edge
<Audioburn>	It's the better alternative
<CHVNX>	I wish I was illegal.
<zildjian>	just say you're from Juarez and have no SSN
<zildjian>	no hospital bill
<Audioburn>	Lol
<Audioburn>	Deportation maybe
<CHVNX>	Racist
<CHVNX>	Xenophobic racist scum

<ceil>	CHVNX: aka 'typical murrikan'
<Audioburn>	'pls dont send me back'

<CHVNX>	Aryanism is overrated.
<Audioburn>	heh
<Audioburn>	no shit
<grayC>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0KTKlCQTjE
<CHVNX>	Besides, most of the white supremacists I have encountered were simpletons. Stupid, low-borw morons.  Some were pseudo-intellecuals who paraded their intellect as a badge of honour, but usually talked too much and exposed their stupidity.
<CHVNX>	brow*

<pikaren>	i feel im burnt out
<pikaren>	every week

<diogenese>	Yes
<y0wza>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=Gfb4qKGjQcs#t=79
<hmir>	It's branded packardbell and i bought it in 2007, so no.
<hmir>	It didn't die out in the 90s.
<y0wza>	Packard Bell is a Dutch-based computer manufacturing subsidiary of Acer.
<y0wza>	lmao i had no idea
<AnTi_MTtr>	yesd it did
<AnTi_MTtr>	it died in 2000
<AnTi_MTtr>	you dont have a packard bell you have an acer laptop with a packard bell sticker on it
<polygraphed>	AnTi_MTtr: Yea, Packard Bells came with a 10lb weight in them I'm pretty sure.
<AnTi_MTtr>	lol
<AnTi_MTtr>	and a bigfoot harddrive
<y0wza>	they sure were heavy
<hmir>	Rebranded acer?
<hmir>	Doesn'at matter though. It's fit for purpose.
<AnTi_MTtr>	hmir:  yeah they basicaly bought the brand in 08 after gateway died
<AnTi_MTtr>	but the last actual packard bell made computers were produced in 1999 or 2000
<AnTi_MTtr>	kinda like what happened to compaq
<AnTi_MTtr>	when hp bought them
<y0wza>	had compaq once
<AnTi_MTtr>	all the actual compaq products went bye bye and they just became rebranded hps

<anonken18>	I hate Lenovo, I got their y50-70 gaming laptop. It failed within a month, took them a month to repair it, and then it came back with scratches all over and it will randomly freeze (rarely, once a month).
<AnTi_MTtr>	huh
<Equinoxdawg>	apparently the guy that made it has a download link for it, not sure I want to get it because that'd kill my spare time
<norkle>	ghey;
<AnTi_MTtr>	i typicaly like lenovo, ive had good epxierences with my lenovo products
<AnTi_MTtr>	but ive never had them repair anything
<AnTi_MTtr>	and i usualy avoid gaming laptops like the plague
<swift110-phone>	Ok
<AnTi_MTtr>	they tend to be the most problematic of the laptops
<anonken18>	Lenovo is pretty good, but their customer service (at least the repair center) is crap.
<swift110-phone>	I have x201
<polygraphed>	I really like my t400
<AnTi_MTtr>	yeah those model lines are solid
<norkle>	smart phones ftw!
<swift110-phone>	Yep
<polygraphed>	I like the redundant mouses, ergonomics. It's like an instrument.
<introvert->	no.
<swift110-phone>	Polygraphed y is that
<anonken18>	I only got the gaming laptop so I could play DOTA 2, Dying Light, etc... It's funny how my laptop runs Dying Light better than my more expensive desktop I built.
<polygraphed>	swift110-phone: Why is what? That I like the multiple mouses?
<AnTi_MTtr>	you bought overpriced parts?
<anonken18>	Oh, and I think the HDD was the thing that failed. It would take ages to boot, and would take 3 minutes just to get into the BIOS. It would never detect USB devices or anything. I don't see how a hard drive could do that, but that was Lenovo's explanation.
<AnTi_MTtr>	hdds can do that
<ceil>	Lenovo's a lying liar
<AnTi_MTtr>	hdds can fail in ways that will just hang the bios up indefinately
<AnTi_MTtr>	its not unheard of
<anonken18>	Well that's good to know. It's a hybris 1TB / 8GB drive.
<anonken18>	hybrid*
<AnTi_MTtr>	they got hybrid drives now?
<anonken18>	Ya
<ceil>	hdd wouldn't fuck up the OS's ability to detect USB though, would it?
<AnTi_MTtr>	heh two points of failure in one impossible to service package
<AnTi_MTtr>	i dont see the advantage
<anonken18>	It wasn't the OS. I couldn't even boot into it.
<AnTi_MTtr>	other than space saving for portabilit
<AnTi_MTtr>	unless
<AnTi_MTtr>	it just uses the ssd part as a cache for the platters
<anonken18>	Well it's a 54000 rpm drive. I bet that's why they made it a hybrid.
<AnTi_MTtr>	that would be nice
<AnTi_MTtr>	does it show up as two volumes in windows?
<AnTi_MTtr>	ssd and the 1tb volume?
<anonken18>	Nope. Just one. Supposedly a chip on the drive controls the cached data.
<Butt3rfly>	morning all
<diogenese>	Morning
<Equinoxdawg>	hmir: I take it back, outlaw them all
<anonken18>	Oh well. I want to get a new laptop anyway. The Lenovo is fine, but I want a more portable one that would be good for game developement (not that I'm any good at it).
*	crazyclown is now known as anku
<anonken18>	I'll probably get an ASUS or something. ASUS seems pretty good.
<AnTi_MTtr>	i typicaly buy asus motherboards
<swift110-phone>	Lol
<AnTi_MTtr>	they tend to hold up well and be of good build quality
<anonken18>	I have an ASUS gaming mobo for my desktop. It was $200
<AnTi_MTtr>	i usualy get the deluxe boards
<AnTi_MTtr>	for the extra pcie slots
<anonken18>	It has never failed on me, and I love their UEFI/BIOS interface. Whatever you would call it.
<AnTi_MTtr>	i expect atleast 2 solid years of performance from my boxes, and if i get another 1-2 years after thats good enough
<anonken18>	This is my mobo. http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/CROSSHAIR_V_FORMULAZ/
<AnTi_MTtr>	oh amd

<anonken18>	Ya. I want to switch to Intel. I just don't have the money.
<Equinoxdawg>	swift110-phone: I downloaded it, it's still a nice game, although the rendering is not that great.

<tallguy>	I have some info on that ...
<grayC>	this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P2mN_u2m3c
<tallguy>	FUCK The word "FUCK" is said to actually be an acronym that originated in medieval times, durng the black plague to keep the population from dwindling (shrinking). It stood for: Fornicate Under Command of the King, The true origin of this word predates "Fornication Under Consent of the King". Originally the Acronym FUCK was the term used to decribe the act of rape. It stands for "Forced Unlawful Carnal Knowledge." In its original use it
<hmir>	Without lyrics it's impossible to tell what the fuck you means in that context.
<grayC>	i think he wants me. this song is sexy
<hmir>	I sure hope so, for your sake.
<grayC>	ha
<grayC>	like igaf

<hmir>	I was having so much fun learning new songs. I haven't even started practicing yet.

<tallguy>	roll pipe tobacco huh

<Romance>	i only think about lands when it comes to property
<tallguy>	properties are objects used in movie production ... or real or personal property, like houses, land or household possessions
<Romance>	what kind of thing they do anyway
<grayC>	manage real estate portfolios
<tallguy>	I have been a Property Manager, oversee many rental houses, apartments, whatever
<grayC>	so you go and find properties and talk fatcats into buying them"adding them to their portfolio" and you get a cut of the sale
<Romance>	what kind of management, they only manage the property they (company) own right. if it comes to buying or tendering, its someone else job?
<tallguy>	hire & fire resident managers, repair and maintence crews, busy all the time

<Butt3rfly>	wow, woman has twins with 2 different fathers
<Butt3rfly>	she took one of the father to court for child maintenance, who carried out a DNA test, and found him to be the father of only one of the babies
<Narp>	slut
<Butt3rfly>	indeed
<grayC>	what did you call me
<Sabotender>	moo 🐮
<Narp>	heteropaternal superfecundation
<Butt3rfly>	http://i.imgur.com/Q8JPt39.gif
<Sabotender>	That's definitely not unheard of. So the woman didn't know she was pregnant with the first child, and her body released a second egg and she had sex with another man, who fertilised the other egg
<Butt3rfly>	she released 2 eggs in her cycle, and had sex with 2 men, less than a week apart from eachother
<Sabotender>	yeppers
<grayC>	sounds slutty
<Butt3rfly>	crazy, what woman actually 'tries' to get pregnant from 2 men who only offering casual sex
<Sabotender>	And I don't think any differerent of her from what she did because men have various multiple partners all the darn time
<Butt3rfly>	we have a saying in my country for women like that....
<Sabotender>	women have the right to do the same without any shame
<Butt3rfly>	"a few sandwiches short of a picnic"
<JessicaJ>	a few fries short of a happy meal
<JessicaJ>	the cheese fell out of her sandwich
<Sabotender>	although all parties SHOULD have used protection to reduce the possible spread of disesase; that is neither here nor there
<Butt3rfly>	lol
<Narp>	Slut-shaming is wrong.
<grayC>	you called me a slut first
<grayC>	slut
<Narp>	I for one encourage sluttary.
<Butt3rfly>	lol
<grayC>	yea id love to be a slut
<Narp>	Any sluts here?
<Sabotender>	Ah, I am so glad i updated my hackintosh to Yosemite. Lol. Things are so snappier compared to Mavericks.
<Butt3rfly>	no sluts Narp, only prudes like me lol
<Narp>	Why be a prude? C'mon, live a little.
<Butt3rfly>	haha
<Narp>	Go to the nearest truck stop or whatever and get lucky.
<Sabotender>	There's a difference from not wanting to be a prude and being stupid
<Sabotender>	random truck stop antics is just stupid
<Butt3rfly>	this is the UK, you can drive from one end to the other and back again in 24 hours, we don't have a lot of need for truck stops here thankfully
<Narp>	I met this one girl who was manic-depressive. In her manic moments, she'd do crazy shit like jump into the cab of a transport truck and go for a ride.
<Sabotender>	Butt3rfly: one thing I loved about being back home; the transportation system is fantastic
<Sabotender>	...compared to the states
<Narp>	I was hoping to get some myself but I never had a chance. Damn bf would come over, too.
<Butt3rfly>	yeah I kinda like having everything within walking distance
<Narp>	Was a friend of a friend.
<diogenese>	Me too. I'm on foot.
<Riking>	there are 10 kinds of people in the world
<Riking>	and they're all sick of hearing this stupid joke
<Narp>	I wish I knew more sluts. :(
<Butt3rfly>	take up truck driving?
<Narp>	I was thinking about it but they get paid horribly here.
<Butt3rfly>	it's all about the 'perks' lol
<Narp>	heh I guess
<Narp>	I have chronic depression.
<Narp>	Never tried a dating site but I'm looking at one.
<Narp>	One of the questions are how ambitious are you?
<Narp>	No... is the answer
<y0wza>	How ambitious are you? no
<Narp>	that's right
<Butt3rfly>	are you taking meds for the depression?
<Narp>	Yeah. I take citalopram.
<Butt3rfly>	so you do 'want' to get better, that's always a good start
<grayC>	it's ok narp
<Narp>	That's a good question. I guess I do.
<Butt3rfly>	:)
*	Butt3rfly hugs Narp 
<grayC>	im going to sleep for awhile
<Narp>	thx :)
<Butt3rfly>	I've been depressed before, it's not fun, but you will get better

<Sabotender>	settle it down
*	Sabotender watches supferrets carefully
<supferrets>	so you guys are competing over imaginary females, because you feel awful, the good news is exercise can help reset hormones into a cool calm mind state

<hubik>	HONEY
<tortib>	treefiddy_, most people from the 80s are pretty dumb from what I can tell.
<honey>	yes?
<treefiddy_>	continue to think that
<honey>	i'm being nice or gtfo. lol
<honey>	i'm on a 1 month challenge.
<treefiddy_>	just remember though
<treefiddy_>	you can't solve a problem using the same thinking you used to create it
<tortib>	treefiddy_, heh, and you're a piece of shit, what's your point?
<hubik>	damn
<Sabotender>	what does that even mean?
<tortib>	Sabotender, it's piece of shit talk.
<treefiddy_>	yes tortib
<tortib>	I wouldn't pay attention to it
<hubik>	honey being spiky is a good thing
*	Sabotender sighs
<treefiddy_>	you're starting to come apart at the seams
<Sabotender>	Forecast says its going to be stormy all week
<tortib>	treefiddy_, how so?
<honey>	oh i dont mean in here.
<treefiddy_>	it's going to start to rebound inward on you
<hubik>	kids rule?
<honey>	everyone that knows me, knows i speak my mind.
<treefiddy_>	you're lashing out in desparation
<hubik>	it's a rebellion!
<tortib>	treefiddy_, I've noticed most people from the 80s are negative scum bags that have to put down other people to make themselves feel better.
<treefiddy_>	trying your hardest to cause some sort of grief in someone elses life
<hubik>	"you have to do be nice to us or you're out mum"
<treefiddy_>	i was born in the 70's though. so im worser haha
<treefiddy_>	dumbass
<treefiddy_>	lol
<tortib>	treefiddy_, yeah, good thing you will be gone soon.
<tortib>	and worser isn't even a word
<treefiddy_>	how so tortib?
<treefiddy_>	i have my health
<treefiddy_>	i am happy
<hubik>	hey guys
<treefiddy_>	all the markers of a long fruitful life
<treefiddy_>	how are you feeling?
<hubik>	come to peace camp it's really fun
<treefiddy_>	a little overweight maybe?
<tortib>	treefiddy_, I am immortal.
<hubik>	we have sex and go boating ;)
<tortib>	treefiddy_, I'm not too concerned about it
<treefiddy_>	sitting in a chair all day?
<treefiddy_>	forming clots
<treefiddy_>	im sure that extra breakfast wont do any harm
<tortib>	I'm not forming clots
<treefiddy_>	or maybe second lunchies?
<tortib>	I don't even eat breakfast
<treefiddy_>	it's fine
<tortib>	another tall tell sign that you have no idea what you're talking about.
<treefiddy_>	you'll be ok
<hubik>	1st breakfast: coffee
<hubik>	2nd breakfast: egg sarnie
<treefiddy_>	as the arteries harden
<tortib>	arteries are in tip top shape
<treefiddy_>	prove it
<treefiddy_>	do a jumping jack
<treefiddy_>	haha
<tortib>	...
<tortib>	how would that prove it?
<hubik>	do a FLIP
<tortib>	DO A BARREL ROLL!
<Sabotender>	speaking of coffee. I think i could do with a cup
<hubik>	..you are old father treefiddy
<tortib>	treefiddy_, do you tell others to get off your lawn?
<hubik>	ooh someone say the poem PLEASE
<treefiddy_>	i dont need to
<tortib>	with your cane
<treefiddy_>	they already know
<tortib>	"Get off my lawn kids!"
<treefiddy_>	my walker
<treefiddy_>	i have a sign
<treefiddy_>	it's very clearly written
<treefiddy_>	in comic sans
<Sabotender>	..I wonder if that coffee creamer is still good that is in the refrigerator
<hubik>	croquet or gtfo
<Butt3rfly>	omnomnom, bacon, tomato, cheese and onion ommlette
<treefiddy_>	sniff test
<treefiddy_>	haha
<tortib>	treefiddy_, have you ever noticed you're the only one that laughs at your dumb jokes?
<hubik>	hope you can still fly Butt3rfly :p
<honey>	Sabotender, i bought coconut milk coffee creamer.
<tortib>	That should be an indicator that you're not as funny as you think you are.
<honey>	not bad either.
<treefiddy_>	tortib: that's all that matters
<Sabotender>	that would work if it actually contained any milk. Which it doesn't :-P
<honey>	idk. lol
<treefiddy_>	i'm very funny
<Sabotender>	honey: oh ive had that before, it is quite tasty
<tortib>	treefiddy_, apparently you don't know how humor works though, probably the dementia kicking in.
<treefiddy_>	if you're not laughing thats because you have a poor sense of humor
<honey>	its french vanilla flavor, but not overly flavored.
<tortib>	treefiddy_, not at all
<treefiddy_>	you'll be ok
<honey>	just serves the purpose
<treefiddy_>	i promise
<tortib>	I just like things that are actually funny
<treefiddy_>	keep sitting in that chair
<treefiddy_>	it has no detrimental effects on you
<Sabotender>	but you have to keep coconut oil very cold as it will go rancid quickly at room temp
<treefiddy_>	you'll be alright
<tortib>	treefiddy_, you're on IRC just as much as most of the active people in here.
<hubik>	really Sabotender ?
<Sabotender>	hubik: really really
<treefiddy_>	ignore the doctor. don't start that diet he prescribed for you
<tortib>	treefiddy_, you're a total hypocrite
<treefiddy_>	you'll go far kid
<treefiddy_>	no tortib the rumor is im two people
<Sabotender>	pure coconut oil with no preservatives added is quite sensitive to going bad
<treefiddy_>	get it straight haha
<treefiddy_>	lol
<Equinoxdawg>	treefiddy_: are you also ssquirrel
<grayC>	do guys like piano music?
<treefiddy_>	no
<grayC>	fuck u
<tortib>	treefiddy_, I bet you're an alcoholic
<treefiddy_>	tortib: that's it. you're off the christmas card list
<treefiddy_>	i am tortib
<tortib>	lol damn, how did I guess that?
<treefiddy_>	i just got back from CVS
<Sabotender>	and you can easily tell the difference. First it will have a simple off-putting fragrange and taste, and then it turns quite foul.
<Sabotender>	lol
<tortib>	I should be an internet psychologist
<treefiddy_>	i bought a whole case of nail polish remover
<tortib>	then I could be the lowest form of doctor on earth
<treefiddy_>	and im filtering it through some bread right now
<treefiddy_>	so i can drink it
<treefiddy_>	cause im an alcoholic
<treefiddy_>	haha
<Butt3rfly>	I'm an aloholic, but only on wednesday evenings and friday evenings
<grayC>	what are you saying
<treefiddy_>	shhh
<Sabotender>	O_o I don't think it would be a good idea to drink Acetone :-(
<treefiddy_>	you're not an alcoholic until you strain shit through bread to drink it
<H2O1>	Butt3rfly, only when you have sex?
<treefiddy_>	shhh Sabotender
<treefiddy_>	that's part of the joke
<Butt3rfly>	I don't have sex H2O1
<H2O1>	O_O
<treefiddy_>	he's not smart enough to get it
<grayC>	im sending this piano song anyway.maybe he will think im complicated
<Sabotender>	oh, sorry. I am only catching pieces of the conversation. As there's about five going on simultaneously
<tortib>	treefiddy_, I'm not smart enough to get it because it isn't funny.
*	Equinoxdawg is taking bets for the big boxing match, tortib vs treefiddy_ 
<tortib>	treefiddy_, Perhaps you fail to understand that a joke has to actually be witty.
<tortib>	treefiddy_, I suggest you watch some george carlin, perhaps see how he does it
<Sabotender>	brb making coffee
<tortib>	treefiddy_, you could probably learn something about being a comedian from him
<treefiddy_>	i do just fine
*	hubik puts coconut oil in the pantry
<H2O1>	Equinoxdawg, what do you think of the last boxing match in Vegas?
<hubik>	mine just says Store in a cool place Sabotender
<treefiddy_>	you don't enjoy it because you're you
<Gluesticky>	IT's a practical joke.
<treefiddy_>	a miserable soul
<Gluesticky>	Make people drink acetone.
<tortib>	treefiddy_, no, I just don't like you :)
<H2O1>	tsk tsk
<treefiddy_>	so you try to bring others down with you
<H2O1>	thats toxic
<treefiddy_>	you used to
<treefiddy_>	what changed?
<tortib>	treefiddy_, nah, never did.
<treefiddy_>	jealousy?
<treefiddy_>	oh so you're fake
<treefiddy_>	because you acted like you did
<treefiddy_>	makes sense
<treefiddy_>	pretend to be something you're not
<tortib>	Are your feelings hurt treefiddy_ ?
<treefiddy_>	and complain about it
<treefiddy_>	yes
<treefiddy_>	im crying into my pillow
<Gluesticky>	treefiddy_ has no feelings, he is a tree.
<tortib>	I'm not pretending to be something I'm not
<H2O1>	Glue, i was thinking the same
<Equinoxdawg>	H2O1: I didn't watch it.
<treefiddy_>	you just admitted to it
<Gluesticky>	treefiddy_ likes sucking H2O1 :-D
<H2O1>	trees are made of 99% dead cells
<tortib>	treefiddy_, do you even have any skills?
<treefiddy_>	you pretended to enjoy conversing.
<treefiddy_>	yes
<H2O1>	Glue, tsk tsk
<treefiddy_>	i am a prima donna balerina
<Butt3rfly>	lol
<treefiddy_>	i have bow staff skills
<treefiddy_>	girls only like guys with skills. gosh
<Gluesticky>	My skills is to have no skills.

<treefiddy_>	it's been a while
<treefiddy_>	heck yes

<treefiddy_>	we are men men in tigggghttttss

<treefiddy_>	no clue

*	margaux-billard is now known as Casseur_fou
<Sabotender>	mmm good coffee
<Sabotender>	1% milk + 2 drops of hazelnut oil added
<Sabotender>	yay
<Sabotender>	I thought I had premixed creamer, but it turns out it was that disgusting sugar free variety that I had forgotten to throw out
<Sabotender>	purchased by accident
<DarkUranium>	I don't like any milk below 3% ... too watery
<DarkUranium>	(and whether 1% milk is milk is arguable ... not sure where the threshold is)
<DarkUranium>	but then, I don't like coffee either *shrug*
<honey>	i dont like milk at all really.
<honey>	except for coffee creamer.
<DarkUranium>	honey, ... you prefer honey?
<Sabotender>	I can't stand whole milk. Its far too rich
<honey>	lol not in coffee.
<grayC>	drink oat milk
<H2O1>	tastes like wood
<grayC>	i love oats
<H2O1>	tastes like treefiddy_
<DarkUranium>	lol
<H2O1>	soy milk tastes like wood/fibers too
<Sabotender>	1% or 2% milk is good for me. I don't like skim milk. Its pretty much white coloured water.
<treefiddy_>	haha
<DarkUranium>	H2O1, how would you know what treefiddy_ tastes like? :P
<treefiddy_>	well
<treefiddy_>	funny story actually
<DarkUranium>	disregard that question
<H2O1>	trees are almost pure fiber
<treefiddy_>	hah
<DarkUranium>	pretty sure I don't want to know about what you guys do every 3rd Thursday at 3:32 AM!
<hubik>	many vitamins are fat soluble
<treefiddy_>	my bark is worse than my bite
<treefiddy_>	bark
<treefiddy_>	tree
<hubik>	corker
<DarkUranium>	lol
<Sabotender>	I recently began seeing literally '0% milk' at the store. There must me something greatly different between 0% and skim. Must be a marketing ploy
<honey>	lol not sure.
<hubik>	oh i thought you meant your coffee was 1% milk
<hubik>	but you mean the milk is 1% fat?
<Sabotender>	oh no. my coffe contains just enough of coffee to be considered 'coffee'. Most people would call it 'coffee flavoured milk'
*	FastLizard4 is now known as FastLizard4|zZzZ
<Sabotender>	yar 1% milkfat
<treefiddy_>	black coffee. no milk, no sweetener
<Sabotender>	I drink 1 or 2%
<treefiddy_>	milk is the devils juice
<honey>	then why is it white?
<honey>	lol
<honey>	eww. no
<treefiddy_>	haha
<honey>	took a few seconds.
<treefiddy_>	you sure you want me to take this one?
<honey>	nooo. lol
<treefiddy_>	im kinda busy
<honey>	i was reading another chan
<treefiddy_>	workin on my skills
<Sabotender>	so like, I fill my coffee cup a quarter with coffee and the rest with milk. Leaving just enough for the displacement of raw sugar.
<treefiddy_>	haha
<Sabotender>	lol
<treefiddy_>	nunchukau skills
<honey>	i'm improving my be nice or gtfo out skills.
<treefiddy_>	schweet
*	ketas notices Sabotender 
<Sabotender>	honey: meh, I tend to take most things in stride.
*	Sabotender waves at ketas 
<Sabotender>	fancy seeing you in this channel
<treefiddy_>	nobodies gonna break my stride. oh no. i got to keep movin
<ketas>	nobody is going to break your pride
<treefiddy_>	yay!
<Sabotender>	you know. I really do like my laptop, but the built in keyboard is really crappy
<treefiddy_>	i havent seen many laptop keyboards ive liked
<Sabotender>	the way it is designed is that if you don't press as near centre to the key as possible, you have a 65% chance that the keypress will be missed
<Sabotender>	treefiddy_: well this one is well below standard
<treefiddy_>	that's no bueno
<Sabotender>	I spend a lot of time using the backspace key to correct mistakes. I find that if I hard press the key, it increases the likelihood that the key wont be missed. I don't usually press that hard though. In similar news, I am totally buying a mechanical keyboard next payday. It will please my programmer's fingers
*	Casseur_fou is now known as hassoon
<H2O1>	IBM model M, thats what I have
<H2O1>	the same keyboard for 20 years on!
<Sabotender>	H2O1: I am buying it from the people who own the patent to that design
<H2O1>	unicomp?
<Sabotender>	so its going to have identical constriution
<Sabotender>	H2O1: aye!
<treefiddy_>	there's no software controls for it?
<Sabotender>	I think they cost ~80USD now
<H2O1>	but theres a lot of alternative, fancier mechanical keyboard, for example do you know the DAS keyboard?
<treefiddy_>	just wondering if the sensitivity is adjustable via the control panel
<Sabotender>	H2O1: overpriced, accept no substitute
<hubik>	ctrl-h easier than backspace
<Sabotender>	in addition, read the Amazon reviews; apparently, they switched chinese manufacturers, so they are of lower than usual quality
<H2O1>	i would have bough the DAS keyboard except for a bothering change they made to their new version
<Sabotender>	there are many instances of 'mushy' spacebars and stuck backspaces
<H2O1>	instead of having 2 legs on the left and right to rise the keyboard, they now use a long bar in the middle, and that bar would bump into my monitor's foot
<Sabotender>	I'm not paying more than 100USD to have to deal with reviews such as that. Nope. I'll take the unicomp keyboard, thanks.
<Sabotender>	that/those
<H2O1>	with Unicomp you wont have a preprogrammed key to put your computer to sleep!
<Sabotender>	You know, ive never actually used that button
<hubik>	cats use that button
<Sabotender>	I do not use any programmable keys on a regular basis. They go largely ignored. I would rather have a simple keyboard with all the standard keys
<H2O1>	i just have to press once on  my computer's power button
<Sabotender>	heck, even the numerical pad is not required.
<H2O1>	s/on/once/
<grayC>	well i got a new kb but icbf connecting it
<grayC>	this one is terrible
<grayC>	full of cig ash
<Sabotender>	hubik: That made me chuckle. ;-)
<Sabotender>	because it's so true
<H2O1>	i never use the numerical pad, im not sure why that exist, that just occupies room on my table
<Sabotender>	you know you really shouldn't smoke in the same room where your computer is
<H2O1>	i say the numerical pad was intended for those folks who can only type with 2 fingers
<Sabotender>	you will just gunk up the motherboard with tarry dust, and you would never be able to resell it.
<grayC>	its ok Sabotender
<Sabotender>	tarry dust is almost impossible to remove with compressed air because it is sticky
<grayC>	i dont care ok
<grayC>	lets dance
<Butt3rfly>	acetone removes it, but it's a pain
<hubik>	most of my computers were free anyway
<Sabotender>	and you can't exactly use a cotton swab impregnated with alcohol to remove it either
<Sabotender>	heh
<grayC>	mmm so smoky room
<hubik>	and they live in a room which is basically a workshop, and has an open fire
<H2O1>	beware acetone, it may remove the ink mark (A,B,C...)  on your keys
<Butt3rfly>	motherboards don't generally have keys
<Sabotender>	Butt3rfly: shouldn't use acetone, as it might remove the resist layer on the PCB
<Butt3rfly>	Sabotender, luckily I don't need to
<Sabotender>	98% isopropyl alcohol is suitable, however
<Sabotender>	Butt3rfly: of course ;-)
<Butt3rfly>	my motherboard is sticky free
<Butt3rfly>	:)
<grayC>	can you drink isopropyl?
<Sabotender>	...you CAN
<Sabotender>	but it doesnt mean you should
<Butt3rfly>	I wouldn't recomend it
<dc2>	https://youtu.be/nnueJhAgfmE - he is teh H2O1 - his name is chow sung, lives on the yellow river - n shovels cow dung; not like the sneakers - that he made when he was young, and before he learned the foo the in the kung; cuz he flips n he kicks- he's like a bag of tricks, ninja assasin with a bow- n bag of sticks;
<Sabotender>	your body doesn't process it in the same manner as other alcohols, its more poisonous
<reveredge>	u can think anything, who is stopping
<reveredge>	if u dont care of consequences
<Sabotender>	anyway, manufacturers usually add bitterants to isopropyl alcohol to make it unpalatable.
<Sabotender>	Also, its minimally processed, so it will burn like all heck going down
<H2O1>	dont use acetone in general, its has unusual dissolving properties
<grayC>	can you drink acetone
<Sabotender>	that smooth alcohol that is in beverages is highly refined and processed
<Sabotender>	grayC: acetone is poisonous. don't do it.
<grayC>	alrite
<grayC>	any good radio stations?
<H2O1>	dont drink any chemical, including coffee with caffeine
<grayC>	so sick of my playlist

<Sabotender>	gz! new dog, new responsibilities
<dc2>	now i have a male dog... he is even more of a sissy
<Sabotender>	do you mean skittish?
<dc2>	apparently he was bullied by other dogs at his old home before the spca got him
<dc2>	or for butterfly - rspca
<dc2>	so now i got him... but hes scared to death of my other dog (whos smaller than him... and female...)
<Sabotender>	so he is skittish and shy... more appropriate than 'sissy'.
<grayC>	how old is he
<dc2>	we think hes like 1 and a half
<grayC>	nice
<dc2>	my other dog is 1
<Butt3rfly>	it's normal for a male dog to 'respect' the female
<hubik>	and small dogs be bossy
<Butt3rfly>	yes
<honey>	doggy daycare would help.
<hubik>	just playfight him and remember to lose ;)

<Sabotender>	grayC: choose your words wisely mate. Desexed prolly doesn't mean what you think it does :-P
<Butt3rfly>	give him a couple of weeks to settle in dc2, he'll be fine
<honey>	neutered or spayed
<grayC>	thats what we say here when we get our pets bits cut
<dc2>	Butt3rfly i know lol
<dc2>	also
<dc2>	he was illegally breed and docked

<Butt3rfly>	lol
<honey>	yeah
<hubik>	oh

<Sabotender>	tsk. I think docking is a cruel thing to do :-(
<hubik>	breeded :p
<honey>	you guys lost me.
<dc2>	i think that docking is cruel to begin with
<honey>	i never owned a dog.
<H2O1>	cats dont eat bread, its full of fibers
<dc2>	honey docking is like
<H2O1>	its like wood to them
<Sabotender>	mmm bread. I purchased sliced french bread the other day. Om nom nom
<grayC>	my dogs cost more to feed every week than i do
<honey>	my cat likes goldfish crackers.
<grayC>	the cats do too
<dc2>	you know when you see show dogs and their tale was cut off?
<dc2>	tail*
<honey>	oh
<dc2>	like dobermans
<honey>	gotcha.
<Sabotender>	honey: heh I'm surprised
<hubik>	when a dog breed has one feature which doesn't fit with it's image
<dc2>	most work dogs are docked
<honey>	my cat is fat, he just got put on a diet.
<jenni>	Is she still loves you
<honey>	but he is big, like large not just fat.
<hubik>	not sheepdogs dc2
<honey>	jenni, sup hooker
<Sabotender>	speaking of cats, i've seen some really bold cats steal food from dogs and run away
<jenni>	we are. I love Him
<Butt3rfly>	have you ever met a doberman that 'didn't' have a docked tail, the tail is dangerous I tell ya
<dc2>	hubik - i mean service dogs... like police fire or military... i dont mean sheep dogs and seeing eye dogs lol
<hubik>	really? like german shepherds?
<dc2>	Butt3rfly ive never seen a dobermans tail
<Sabotender>	oh I have
<dc2>	hubik - as i said most service dogs
<hubik>	hmmm
<dc2>	so anyways
<hubik>	why don't they fall over?
<grayC>	even the fish eats more than i do
<Butt3rfly>	it's like a long thin whip dc2, knocks everything over and whips everyone
<dc2>	new dog was illegally docked by previous owner and his tail instead of the like 1 inch lenght its ment to me.. is like... maybe 1/4 of an inch... its almost non-existant
<dc2>	ment to be*
<hubik>	get some polyploid paste :p
<H2O1>	:-P
<dc2>	ooo butterfly i know a pitbull/doberman mix that has its tail and its tail is pretty dangerous :p
<hubik>	sounds like the whole dog should be dangerous
<dc2>	but its 1 ofthe most docile doberman mix's ive ever seen... (prolly cuz it got bit my mate once and got rung in the face with a shover
<dc2>	shovel*

<Sabotender>	pit bulls and dobermans can be raised to be really sweet dogs, they just have a bad reputation.
<dc2>	https://youtu.be/vBUi6TclsTY - oh shit you bite master~ n now you in trouble! better run at the double~ cuz master's gettin teh shovel
<hubik>	i'm not saying they're bad
<hubik>	a happy, enthusiastic pitbull is quite a hazard
<Sabotender>	compared to? I would say a happy, enthusiastic great dane is far more of a hazard
<grayC>	mine are out ther barking at vagrants or who knows what
<hubik>	hahah
<Sabotender>	as they are notoriously clumsy
<hubik>	dog breeds are weird
<Butt3rfly>	I've got an American Bulldog, she looks twice as tough as a pitbull but she's as soft as they come
<Sabotender>	ive seen great danes knock over small children flat on their faces without meaning to.
<hubik>	my dog did that and he's half the size of a great dane :p
<hubik>	just turn around quick, bam
<grayC>	ive done it myself, little kids are notoriously imbalanced
<hubik>	hahah
<hubik>	and unbalancing
<grayC>	;)
<grayC>	sly knee to the spine
<dc2>	1 of my mates wanted a saint benard... till he realised they dont come with a rum barrel attached
<grayC>	lolol
<Sabotender>	My point is that in most cases, the dog's temperament is largely dependent on how it was raised. Raise it to be sweet, and it will be, raise it to be ferocious, and it will be. Of course there are variations as all dogs have unique personalities and are easier to mould one way or the other.
<Butt3rfly>	I didn't want a dog, but my friend turned up one evening with a 10 month old pup that had had a really bad start in life, I fell in love with her
<hubik>	aww
<Butt3rfly>	she's been right by my side ever since
<hubik>	i didn't know i wanted a dog
<hubik>	when my dog was young, we were out with my friend, their naughty little dog chased sheep
<hubik>	i more or less laid on my dog's head
<Butt3rfly>	my dog chases cows if I let her
<Butt3rfly>	I have to put her lead on when the cows are in the field
<hubik>	normally cows chase us :o
<H2O1>	great, no need to go to the supermarket to buy beef
<hubik>	they are lary scary
<Butt3rfly>	she chases cows, but she's afraid of chickens, go figure lol
<hubik>	chickens are ninja fast tho
<H2O1>	do dogs have a soul?
<Butt3rfly>	do people?
<grayC>	my brown one does but the black one doesnt
<H2O1>	what about the gray ones, grayC?
<H2O1>	you know, right, that black is just an (extreme) shade of gray?
<SimenOlai>	Butt3rfly, In Norway you always have to have them in lead
<duckgoose>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Crj20WOgYSw
<H2O1>	do ducks and spiders have a soul?
<duckgoose>	yes
<Butt3rfly>	what if, all of the creatures on the earth, possess a tiny part of the complete soul of the planet

<CHVNX>	AnTi_MTtr: But, you... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otCpCn0l4Wo
*	AnTi_MTtr slowly pulls on a pair of parachute pants
<CHVNX>	FreezingCold: Yes, it passed yesterday.  100% of the Liberals and Conservatives voted for it, and only the NDP and Greens voted against or abstained from voting.  The three independant seats also voted for the bill.
<FreezingCold>	It passed the house of commons, not entirely law yet.
<CHVNX>	The passing of C-51 is literally the government telling its people to go fuck itself.
<FreezingCold>	meh, I don't get why Trudeau supported it. I somewhat agree with most of his politics, but I don't get that move.
<CHVNX>	Voting NDP is the oly thing that can "save" us from the tyrants of the Liberal and Conservative parties, I fear.
<FreezingCold>	I think maybe because he's been getting so much support, he just assumed he could say "yes" without thinking it over.
<FreezingCold>	The NDP will bankrupt the country and drive out any business.
<FreezingCold>	The cons will bankrupt the country and put us all in jail :p
<lwh>	will they stop all o&g
<FreezingCold>	The liberals will probably fuck up the economy, though they might get lucky.
<CHVNX>	The NDP will make Canada the Canada we used to remember.
<CHVNX>	The neocons and liberals have taken us to illegal wars and kept us there for over a decade.
<CHVNX>	They have destroyed our economy, especially in Ontario.
<FreezingCold>	CHVNX: heh, the NDP will be raising taxes like crazy. We don't need that...
<lwh>	yeah look at that TSX
<CHVNX>	They have had massive job loss in many important regions whilst basically lying and claiming to have created new jobs.
<CHVNX>	FreezingCold: The tax raises that would come from an NDP majority would make the country a lot better than it is now.  I enjoy healthcare and education, and only the greedy and the stupid would argue against it.
<FreezingCold>	The NDP wants to make jobs for the sake of having jobs, not having jobs for the sake of growing the economy. Those might sound like the same, but the subtle difference is key.
<CHVNX>	That's an over simplification of the NDP platform, most of which I am opposed to, by the way.
<FreezingCold>	We don't have to raise taxes to have those programs. We need to use our funds more wisely.
<FreezingCold>	Newfoundland is one of my favorite examples. They created a huge hedge fund to invest, but then found out there's nothing to invest in there.
<FreezingCold>	heh, looks like they might have even shut down GrowthWorks Atlantic Venture Fund.
<FreezingCold>	nvm, it's still going.
<lwh>	they could lobby for middle east wars
<lwh>	then learn from norway
<FreezingCold>	There's also Build Ventures that's sort of working ish.
<FreezingCold>	but again, not enough things to invest in.

<AnTi_MTtr>	my god foxnews actualy has a segment called "Fox on Reddit"
<AnTi_MTtr>	lol
<AnTi_MTtr>	wtf is happening?!
<LauraCottonTail_>	Hi
<CHVNX>	Fox is hijacking popular culture.
<FreezingCold>	CHVNX: I don't know if you've ever worked or lived in Canada for an extended amount of time, but our taxes vs. services rate is out of whack.
<CHVNX>	They let Nazis have their own subreddits, so why not Fox News?
<AnTi_MTtr>	well with that logic, yeah
<AnTi_MTtr>	why not
<FreezingCold>	CHVNX: Canada is not a cheap place to live in.
<CHVNX>	FreezingCold: As a life-long Canuck, I can assure you that our services have helped a lot of people in my life, and likely yours.
<yano>	https://youtu.be/zAkjnft7KmU
<CHVNX>	FreezingCold: It is if you don't live like a glutton.
<lwh>	free doctor is amazing
<AnTi_MTtr>	CHVNX: social contracts arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreat!
<FreezingCold>	CHVNX: You can't force rent down, food is expensive (I'm talking about groceries, not eating out).
<FreezingCold>	Those two things make up the bulk of my living costs.
<AnTi_MTtr>	you cant?
<CHVNX>	While I don't want to seem as if I am arguing in favour of government, I won't lie and deny the fact that government has helped many people in dire situations.
<AnTi_MTtr>	FreezingCold: you can in the states
<CHVNX>	FreezingCold: I eat every day, and I'm not well off.
<AnTi_MTtr>	eating doesnt win!
<FreezingCold>	CHVNX: They could cut down taxes to about half of what they are if they stopped wasting money things. I'm in favor of keeping tax rates where they are (maybe with a *slow* decline), and spending money more wisely.
<CHVNX>	If you can't afford to eat, but can afford to use the Internet, then you have your priorities all wrong. Sell your computer, cut the DSL line, and buy some food.
<FreezingCold>	CHVNX: Internet is pretty much free?
<FreezingCold>	eduroam.
<CHVNX>	Internet in Canada is free? Who is delusional now?
<AnTi_MTtr>	man cannot live on bits and bytes alone!

<lwh>	you should run for office
<FreezingCold>	I can go to the states and get free WiFi at most universities too.
<CHVNX>	I run from officers often
<CHVNX>	Of, run for office. Damn dyslexia.
<introvert->	LOL
<Fowler>	lol
<FreezingCold>	CHVNX: lol, lots of Canadians run from officers too :p
<introvert->	"sorry, but i'm aboot to ditch you."
<CHVNX>	/that's the joke/
<FreezingCold>	that's another complaint I have about Canada, our police are not effective.
<CHVNX>	They're authoritarian assholes who beat and abuse citizens, abuse their authority, and constantly break the law,
<introvert->	are they effective anywhere? I mean you give a man a badge, and a gun. and all of a sudden they're better than everyone else.
<FreezingCold>	I've never bought drugs in my life but still name a dozen drug dealers easily.
<CHVNX>	FreezingCold: It's not like drug dealers are inherently bad people, though.
<FreezingCold>	Downtown bars in small cities have cocaine being used in the open.
<CHVNX>	That's a fallacy.
<introvert->	there's worse thing in life thn drugs.
<introvert->	things.
<FreezingCold>	CHVNX: Don't start pretending that the correlation isn't true. Also, don't start telling me that cocaine is going to help society.
<CHVNX>	FreezingCold: How does that affect you in a negative way? You dislike cocaine? Don't do cocaine.
<sud0>	hows the tuna subway sandwich
<sud0>	is it any good
<CHVNX>	sud0: No, it's not.

<sud0>	alright, thanks
<CHVNX>	Veggie sub with everything but olives and mayo, please.

<AnTi_MTtr>	pastrami hot, with pickles and extra mustard please
<CHVNX>	FreezingCold: You have no idea what you are talking about. As a capitalist, I woudl assume you would endorse businesses that don't suck funds from the government.
<FreezingCold>	they *do* suck funds. They don't report their income.
<CHVNX>	FreezingCold: Legalize drusg and you wont have those imaginary problems.
<FreezingCold>	You will have other problems.
<AnTi_MTtr>	amen
<FreezingCold>	Like, people not getting shit done.
<AnTi_MTtr>	lol
<y0wza>	need 2 open up better rehab centers first th
<y0wza>	o
<y0wza>	also everywhere
<CHVNX>	If you think that legalizing drugs will make everyone lazy, you are functionally retarded.
<AnTi_MTtr>	FreezingCold: like its so hard to get drugs now
<FreezingCold>	CHVNX: It would be more cost effective to legalize drugs and then kill anybody who's not productive because of their drug habits. Obviously that's fucking insane, so let's *not* legalize hardcore drugs.
<AnTi_MTtr>	FreezingCold: also ignoring the fact that most of the drug users in this country are using perscription drugs
<AnTi_MTtr>	not illicit drugs
<AnTi_MTtr>	abusing them rather
<FreezingCold>	Sure, true. Most of them are able to get to work though.
<CHVNX>	Everyone that does drugs right now will be the same people who do drugs if they are legalized.  Nothing will change, except for the fact that it will generate enough income to pay for a couple of wars.
<CHVNX>	That should be up your alley.
<FreezingCold>	CHVNX: Right, my point is we need to *stop* the current drug users.
<AnTi_MTtr>	FreezingCold: pfft, thats asuming perscription drugs somehow allow you to work or drive better than illicit ones? thats a bad assumption
<FreezingCold>	Our anti-drug laws are pointless because there's no enforcement.
<FreezingCold>	It's like banning alcohol.
<CHVNX>	FreezingCold: Yes, stop the war on drugs. Legalize drugs.
<FreezingCold>	It's a great idea.
<AnTi_MTtr>	stopping drug users is never going tot happen
<CHVNX>	FreezingCold: No enforcement? I read about raids in my city EVERY DAY.
<AnTi_MTtr>	if someone wants to take drugs, legal or illegal they will
<FreezingCold>	CHVNX: Which city...?
<CHVNX>	The police are literally spying on drug users EVERYWHERE and are raiding them like it's 1999.
<AnTi_MTtr>	no one can stop them
<CHVNX>	FreezingCold: In Ontario.
<Cosmicjoker>	legalise and tax them yo
<CHVNX>	AnTi_MTtr: Exactly.
<FreezingCold>	CHVNX: Fair enough, Ontario isn't *that* bad for enforcement. Still, they're going after small dealers which is a tad pointless.
<FreezingCold>	The FBI is a better example, at least they somewhat know what they're doing.
<CHVNX>	FreezingCold: Why do think that *any* law enforcement is a good thing?
<FreezingCold>	Keep people in line.
<CHVNX>	The vast majority of laws being enforced are victimless crimes.
<CHVNX>	The police are inherently immoral.
<FreezingCold>	CHVNX: Drug driving is a victimless crime by that same standard.
<FreezingCold>	*drunk driving
<FreezingCold>	Do you support drunk driving?
<FreezingCold>	I mean as long as you don't hit anybody.
<FreezingCold>	Who is it really hurting?
<FreezingCold>	victimless.
<introvert->	how you gunna diss your cops then act like they have a purpose.
<CHVNX>	You're the fascist-like fool who wants Canada to be an authoritarian hell hole. You want to give the police more authority, want the police to be harasher, want to rape our economy with lax capitalism and lowered taxes for the filthy rich.... You are what's wrong with Canada, FreezingCold.
<FreezingCold>	No, the police already have enough authority.
<CHVNX>	Also, I literally lost two women in my life due to drunk driving, an ex and a wife.
<FreezingCold>	They're using it poorly.
<CHVNX>	So, dont try that shit with me, fucker.
<FreezingCold>	CHVNX: So you don't support drunk driving, but support people doing risky shit that could also endanger your life? Nice double standard.
<FreezingCold>	Also, there's no such thing as filthy rich. It's my money, fuck off.
<sud0>	damn, CHVNX
<y0wza>	dude fuck it jus bomb canada blo it up boom all gone we needa get rid of all of canadaz problems
<y0wza>	dam druggies dam anti druggies dam dam
<y0wza>	fuCK
<FreezingCold>	CHVNX: If we didn't legalize alcohol, those two women would still be alive. That's your fault.
<sud0>	y0wza: stfu
<y0wza>	continue this heated discussion
<AnTi_MTtr>	 <FreezingCold> Also, there's no such thing as filthy rich. It's my money, fuck off. <<=-- the literal embodiment of greed
<y0wza>	man fuck u
<y0wza>	lmao
<y0wza>	i aint even bein serious
<AnTi_MTtr>	your monney that you made using the public services provided to you by the government since your birth
<AnTi_MTtr>	are you that unaware of how much you've profited from the taxes others have paid?
<FreezingCold>	AnTi_MTtr: Desire for success is nothing to be ashamed of.
<sud0>	y0wza: stfu
<AnTi_MTtr>	greed != desire for success
<y0wza>	no u
<sud0>	y0wza: stfu
<sud0>	y0wza: stfu
<FreezingCold>	AnTi_MTtr: so then it's not greed.
<y0wza>	dam how many times we gonna do this
<AnTi_MTtr>	FreezingCold: your statement was the very definition of greed
<sud0>	y0wza: stfu
<y0wza>	awe
<FreezingCold>	AnTi_MTtr: Taxes actually profit very little services for the amount you pay.
<AnTi_MTtr>	whatever that means
<FreezingCold>	Corporations pay taxes like everyone else.
<sud0>	I am starting at this nice coworker's ass
<y0wza>	lmao
<sud0>	so if u talk I cant focus, y0wza
<y0wza>	im sory man
<sud0>	no problem, u didnt know
<sud0>	was my bad
<FreezingCold>	CHVNX: Your drug legalizing attitude will put more people like them in the grave.
<FreezingCold>	And it serves the right.
<AnTi_MTtr>	not as much as the war on drugs does
<AnTi_MTtr>	so id call it a net gain
<hmir>	You ain't foolin' nobody!
<FreezingCold>	Who cares about the people who die in the war on drugs? Nearly all of them had it coming.
<AnTi_MTtr>	clearly not you
<hmir>	Drugs are how the 1 percenters stay in the 1 percent.
<AnTi_MTtr>	lol
<LauraCottonTail_>	Hi
<AnTi_MTtr>	<FreezingCold> CHVNX: Your drug legalizing attitude will put more people like them in the grave. <<<=---- i love the juxtoposition ----->>> <FreezingCold> Who cares about the people who die in the war on drugs? Nearly all of them had it coming.
<sud0>	hey LauraCottonTail_
<FreezingCold>	AnTi_MTtr: People die every day, I can't give a shit about all of them. It's the same reason why you can be happy during the day when children from shit countries are dying by the minute.
<sud0>	theres a drug discussion going on, LauraCottonTail_
<FreezingCold>	AnTi_MTtr: Dead people cost money to raise before they die.
<jigsawFE>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=899Zl1Fu0CU
<FreezingCold>	AnTi_MTtr: If you die at 20 without a job, you probably haven't given anywhere near to what was invested in you.
<cssgirl>	Hi LauraCottonTail_
<FreezingCold>	CHVNX seems to have bitched out of the conversation.
<screwsss>	lol can someone in here ask for my ban to be lifted from #windows

<Audioburn_work>	ha, what if
<sunstar>	wheres is this net neutrality?
<Scourjee>	Tor is stupid
<NotSmirks>	why do you have comcast
<NotSmirks>	comcast is trash
<hosified>	Scourjee: naw, it's got some valid purposes.
<sheep>	NotSmirks: because it's the only option in many areas
<Scourjee>	Anybody can use tor
<sud0>	If I feel farting like this I am next to get a farting nickname
<NotSmirks>	well that sucks
<sheep>	unless you want to use dialup, which is slow, or satellite internet, which is slow, laggy, and very expensive
<NotSmirks>	sud0, FartingSuds0?
<sud0>	I really meant it
<sud0>	I am farting like a pro at work
<sunstar>	in the area you can get comcast, at&t, or wireless crap that costs a ton
<hosified>	Scourjee: you still become visible as using Tor....probably cause for monitoring.  You must be a terrorist.
<Time-Warp>	you think the heartbeat thing was just there for the lulz
<Time-Warp>	so much for tor
<Time-Warp>	heartbleed ftw
<wtf-honey>	lol no

<Scourjee>	Beyond Time has a 'no form factor'. It is everywhere, but undetectable. There is some element, or key in certain individuals minds that boosts beyond time signal strength. Today it has been very strong. On multiple occasions I have been able to think of events seconds before they happen. It's subconscious. The thought will just enter my head at seemingly random moments, then it happens 20 seconds later.

<kbw>	and south brazil being rich
<Sabotender>	My breaking point was at 16. My mum was going to settle down in the states, so i hatched a plan. I secretly sent letters to various universities in the area to receive attendance. I got accepted to all I applied. I then absolutely BEGGED my mum to take me with her, to the astonishment of my guardians. ;-)
<kbw>	sud0, what country are your parents from?
<sud0>	I am from italy
<sud0>	my mom is from uruguay
<sud0>	and my dad is also italian
<hmir>	So, why not move to Italy?
<kbw>	hmm
<sud0>	Why should I?
<kbw>	good internet speeds where you are?
<sud0>	besides I wont move anywhere before I finsih my degree
<sunstar>	whoa
<sud0>	hmm, I have 100mb/s
<hmir>	Sabotender; did your mom not take you?
<sunstar>	just found a 6 camera DVR system in the gutter
<sud0>	I think its quite good for a 3rd world country
<hosified>	MB/S be better
<Audioburn_work>	test
<sunstar>	fail
<Sabotender>	hmir: of course she did. I'm in the US, aren't I? :-P
<hmir>	Oh, wait I just read she did.
<kbw>	sud0, you don't like uruguay? :p
<hmir>	Why would you have to beg your mom to take you tho?
<Audioburn_work>	sunstar, :(
<hmir>	Don't get that.
<Sabotender>	sud0: Don't hold your breath mate, I've been asking to be an operator in this channel for YEARS :-P
<sud0>	I love this country, but I dont feel like starting a family and all that stuff here, kbw
<sud0>	sadly economy here isnt that good
*	Sabotender chuckles
<hosified>	I don't want the responsibility of babysitting IRCers....keep your ops
<Time-Warp>	./msg chanserv op ##chat hosified
<kbw>	I wouldn
<Time-Warp>	:D
<kbw>	I wouldn't start a family where I am right now
<kbw>	There's a huge class divide in atlanta
<hmir>	Don't start a family at all.
<Audioburn_work>	Sade is what warmth sounds like.
<hosified>	I knew the reverse-physc would work
<Sabotender>	hmir: I am embellishing a little. She knew I was an adult and ready to be on my own, and she also knew that I was going to be attending college so I would only be staying with her for a very short period of time.
<sud0>	I was wondering about canada
<sud0>	or germany
<kbw>	The "middle class" here makes wages barely above the poverty line
<sud0>	but german language would be an issue
<hosified>	Canada rules, but i'd like to make USD :P
<sunstar>	why would you want to start a family anywhere in these dark times?
<grant>	germany speaks english ok
<hosified>	sunstar: my thoughts on a daily basis
<hmir>	Havings kids will just make you poor.
<hosified>	hmir: do you have kids or are you talking out your ass?
<Time-Warp>	kbw: in sanfrancisco there is no middle class
<Time-Warp>	its rich or homeless
<kbw>	hosified, aren't canadians blocked from decent material on netflix etc?
<swift110-phone>	Hm true
<hmir>	I don't have kids but how does that matter?
<kbw>	Because of hollywood's fascist region locking?
<hosified>	kbw: I wouldn't know, i'm too old school to pay for content
<hmir>	It's basic economics.
<sud0>	I bought netflix but cant watch GOT here :(
<sud0>	thanks obama
<Time-Warp>	brb going to cause an outage
<kbw>	I just torrent like everyone else when I miss an episode
<Sabotender>	I subscribed to HBO Now or whatever it is called
<sunstar>	you could easily spend a million dollars on kids (over the coarse of a lifetime)
<kbw>	but we pay for HBO
*	Sabotender high-fives kbw 
<kbw>	so it's not a crime, right?
<sud0>	I do as well, but I like netflix's HD and speed
<hosified>	I'm that generation of people who think because they work in technology for 20+ years, they have an entitlement to whatever fucking content and data I want.
<Sabotender>	15USD is well worth the cost of HBO
<kbw>	ya
<Sabotender>	I absolutely MUST have my Real Time with Bill Maher
<kbw>	I remember when AMC was just the old movie channel
<sunstar>	^
<hosified>	cable is way overratted.
<hmir>	I feel entitled.
<sunstar>	it still is Sabotender, you just got old
<zildjian>	cable is overpriced
<Sabotender>	hosified: you mean too expensive
<kbw>	I would buy movies and such if they weren't riddled with DRM
<hosified>	Sabotender: that too, but you are paying a company to interrupt your shows and market crap to you.  The time you lose on regular cable does not equal the value of the content.
<sud0>	hmir are you a sexy motherfucker
<Sabotender>	I absolutely hate commercials. They drive me mad. one of the reasons I got rid of cable. the other reason is the time compression that happens to television shows and movies
<hosified>	They should fucking pay me for watching commercials and the crap they have on repeat.
<zildjian>	sud0: having kids in your country is probably better than in the US.  Kids these days have 100k in debt just to get a undergrad degree
<hosified>	fuck cable.
<kbw>	My uncle buys DVDs anyways and uses a de-CSS software him and a friend wrote like 20 years ago
<yano>	i'm having truoble finding a quote from Boy Meets World. i'm pretty sure it was Eric, but it could have been Corey, that basically was telling their father something along the lines of "you'll always be with me, when i turn around to teach my children the same things you've taught me"
<yano>	google is prooving fruitless
<Sabotender>	time compression generally means running the movie at a slightly faster speed and cutting out certain parts
<sud0>	Well yeah, health and education has always been free here, zildjian
<hosified>	kbw: I'm questioning if they wrote the de-css software...
<sud0>	also college
<kbw>	hosified, they did
<kbw>	I've seen the code
<kbw>	Nothing else on the net matches
<sunstar>	cutting out the good parts and editing the funny parts so they arent funny anymore (and why? TV shows say/do way worse things than what dialogue gets editing/dubbed)
<hosified>	kbw: not calling you a liar, just having a hard time believing it.  Care to share?
<Sabotender>	hosified: exactly, and even though it is illegal to blast commercials at a different volume than the show you are watching, I've noticed that it is still done
<kbw>	hosified, he doesn't want me sharing it, sorry
<duckgoose>	so
<hosified>	Sabotender: it is, happens all the time.
<sunstar>	many ppl have writted de-css progs
<duckgoose>	animals having sex is ok on youtube
<kbw>	I have it on a CD he mailed me a couple years ago
<kbw>	don't know where it is
<duckgoose>	unless that animal is a human....
<duckgoose>	hmm
<hosified>	sunstar: agree, I was just questioning this random IRC person if his uncle and whatnot had written one.  Seemed unlikely.
<hosified>	but i'll give benefit of the doubt...carry on as if you were normal.
<kbw>	They wrote it in Java which kind of triggers me :p
<hosified>	and boom goes the dynamite.
<hmir>	Nope!
<zildjian>	kbw: that doesn't mean he wrote it :P  Also that algorithm is not exactly s3cr3t lol
<bazhang>	http://boy-meets-world-quotes.tumblr.com/  yano
<kbw>	zildjian, at the time it was
<bazhang>	they  have a quote wiki as well yano
<yano>	bazhang: i've been looking
<bazhang>	yano, knowing who said it would help narrow the search a ton
<kbw>	What do you all think of Ubuntu's new "snappy" thing?
<hosified>	never tried it, stuck on my fedora as of late.
<Timmy>	same
<bazhang>	kbw, its superb
<Sabotender>	kbw: unknown. I am using lubuntu. :-P
<kbw>	I think it's an interesting concept
<sunstar>	i think ima have to try ubuntu again. havent run mainline ubuntu in 2 years
<hosified>	what is it exactly?
<kbw>	But is it necessary for everything?
<yano>	bazhang: i've tried searching as Eric and only stuff i find online are the funny stuff people have posted
<hosified>	elaborate please.
<thomas_d>	yo can I speak about chat here?
<sunstar>	?
<sheep>	yes
<yano>	bazhang: and i tried searching as Corey but there is way too many quotes said by him to narrow it down
<kbw>	hosified, do you know of OS X's "executable" format?
<bazhang>	about chat?
<thomas_d>	yo what's up with the complete void of options/sites when it comes to proper hxc video chat websites these days
<hosified>	hosified: no experience with OS X whatsoever
<thomas_d>	like what stickam was
<thomas_d>	and what tinychat fails to be
<kbw>	.app folders containing the binaries and resources for each program
<sunstar>	facebook is whats up
<Sabotender>	well, my notebook is a hackint0sh running Yosemite which i JUST upgraded to yesterday (YAY), desktop computer is W8.1, and I am running a VM which is lubuntu for programming purposes ;-)
<kbw>	It's kind of like that, but for Linux
<hosified>	coo
<bazhang>	similar to dmg
<thomas_d>	why isnt there some awesome FOSS style social stickam-like chatroom website
<yano>	i'm pretty sure they were in the kitchen when it was said
<Sabotender>	mmm Yosemite is so nice, so buttery smooth and it makes very good use of the P and C states
<hosified>	the only apple product i've ever owned is an ipad2
<Audioburn_work>	OP Audioburn
<kbw>	Sabotender, I tried hackintoshing this machine only to discover that its CPU isn't supported
<sunstar>	why use some good chat program when there is skype?
<thomas_d>	sunstar: because people need to meet strangers
<kbw>	I've tried using clover to set a fake CPU ID to no avail
<thomas_d>	all current applications are for talking to people that you know already
<hosified>	ICQ!  russian owned and operated!
<kbw>	Hackintoshing is a waste of effort anyways
<thomas_d>	which is not good enough
<kbw>	It's more tedious than maintaining a Gentoo install on one's desktop
<bazhang>	need to meet strangers
<Sabotender>	kbw: lol, really? what kind of CPU do you have over there? Most likely its your motherboard that isn't supported. Just about every new-ish CPU is supported, even AMDs
<bazhang>	yeah thats not creepy
<sunstar>	well billions of inumformed noobs like all this corperate shit and dont tolerate the ugly, the old or the "free"
<thomas_d>	what do u call this bazhang
<yano>	i'm 85% sure it was Eric
<Sabotender>	though its a bit more difficult to get it to work on AMD these days, its better to have an Intel CPU for native installation.
<bazhang>	people I know
<kbw>	Sabotender, Pentium G3258. My motherboard is well support, in fact it doesn't need a DSDT.
<thomas_d>	u dont know me
<thomas_d>	u know everyone else in here??
<bazhang>	well enough as I'd want to
<kbw>	If I had an i3 or i5 everything would work out of the box
<Sabotender>	kbw: that's a pretty funky pentium you have over there
<Sabotender>	lol
<kbw>	Sabotender, not really.
<kbw>	It's a very popular model
<Sabotender>	yar, my laptop uses an i5
<thomas_d>	well anyway there are a lot of cool dudes out there who just want to troll other dudes and maybe meet some hot babes online too
<kbw>	All haswell pentiums and celerons aren't currently supported
<thomas_d>	and there aren't any decent options for that anymore... so that sucks
<bazhang>	thats all I ever wanted to know
<sunstar>	well billions of inumformed noobs like all this corperate shit and dont tolerate the ugly, the old or the "free"
<kbw>	The pentium from my older machine works though.
<Sabotender>	4GB memory and HD4000 graphics
<bazhang>	and yeah super creepy
<Sabotender>	bazhang: wait, what's creepy?
*	Sabotender reads the buffer
<sunstar>	using a chat app to meet random strangers
<bazhang>	going around all hidden trying stalk others
<sunstar>	baz isnt here to meet new ppl, hes here to police them
<Sabotender>	yah, that is pretty creepy
<thomas_d>	lol bazhang thats not what im talking about
<bazhang>	s/police/kindergarten cop/
<kbw>	Keeping your identity private is essential on IRC.
<Time-Warp>	Sabotender: whats creepy
<kbw>	I had to learn that the hard way
<sunstar>	i get you thomas, the problem is the corperate stranglehold US companies have on the internet
<ceil>	wut
<thomas_d>	how does that have such an impact on this sunstar ? is it just that the hosting costs too much??
<sunstar>	and the noobs who buy into it
<hosified>	sweet, my lady brought dinner home and you guys aren't that interesting to keep me here :)
<hosified>	peace out!
<ceil>	what stranglehold is on the internet?
<bazhang>	imaginary one
<ceil>	bazhang: i'm sayin'
<bazhang>	to stop his creepy stalkerin
<ceil>	wat
*	hosified is now known as hosified_afk
<kbw>	It's only the north american ISPs who want a stranglehold
<sunstar>	to thrive you must have a populous, and with the current US corperate offerings, its hard to gain traction.
<ceil>	clearly this channel went and got interesting when i went shopping <.<
<bazhang>	stalkers HAVE RIGHTS TOO!!1111
<ceil>	kbw: ever hear of this little island called Britain?
<Sabotender>	kbw: it was actually a right ol pain to get my DSDT perfect. I worked hard at it and now the DSDT is perfect, it pretty much means that all my hardware will work properly with any version of OSX. The ONLY issue that I haven't figured out is the screen dimming, but I don't really much care about that. The system sleeps and wakes, no clicks or static in the speakers, USB 3.0 is good to go, mic and camera work, full CPU  P and C states, full
<Sabotender>	 graphic acceleration too
<Sabotender>	oops, I didn't mean for that to run on a second line :-P
<thomas_d>	ceil: whats that got to do with anything here???
<kbw>	Sabotender, but what use is OS X other than using final cut?
<thomas_d>	we're talking about the internet
<bazhang>	good thing it was ten lines tehn
<ceil>	thomas_d: did you even read kbw's line to which i was responding?
<ceil>	or are you just completely unaware of UK internet censorship?
<bazhang>	hes too busy snapchatterin
<Sabotender>	kbw: Textual 5. It's my baby. i refuse to use any other IRC client. its only available on OS X. And photoshop is better in OSX too in my opinion.
<thomas_d>	ceil: I am just completely unaware of UK internet censorship
<kbw>	Huh
<ceil>	well, it exists, and is far more severe than anything in the US
<kbw>	I can't seem to use anything other than hexchat
<diogenese>	I like hexchat
<thomas_d>	yeah they're censoring all the torrent sites, that's the main right?
<sunstar>	you cant even legally own a DVD burner
<bazhang>	is today your first day on the internet thomas_d
<ceil>	and a lot of hentai, and many other sites deemed troublemakers
<cobracommand>	hi
<sunstar>	hi
<thomas_d>	bazhang: yes
<ceil>	it's amazing brits still manage to get online at all, really
<bazhang>	thomas_d, also IRC
<thomas_d>	bazhang: no
<ceil>	bazhang: what is this... "eye are see"?
<Sabotender>	kbw: It also seems to better support my iPhone as well. It might be in my imagination though. OS X, being a  Unix variant, seems to give me greater power over disc partitioning, something that Windows was never really good at.
<bazhang>	thomas_d, I suggest you take the creepy stalk chat some other place, ie not here
<sunstar>	baz chill dude hes totally within his rights
<bazhang>	hahahahahah rights
<ceil>	he's creepy stalking?
<Sabotender>	sunstar: best to listen to the ops mate. ;-)
<ceil>	it's funny that you think you have rights here, though
<bazhang>	xkcd.com/1357
<sunstar>	baz just made that part up
<ceil>	chatting here is a privilege
<ceil>	you need to check yours : p
<Sabotender>	on wow, flash rain outside
<kbw>	Sabotender, disk utility is great
<Time-Warp>	ZOMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
<bazhang>	he's never read xkcd
<ceil>	bazhang: you got that one bookmarked?
<Sabotender>	kbw: yah it is. It has saved my rump many a time.
<thomas_d>	no offence but from what I've been seeing here so far this level of chat is pretty subpar in my experience
<kbw>	Sabotender, if you want to see real hell try partitioning something on OpenBSD :p
<ceil>	whipped it out pretty quick lol
<Sabotender>	oh dear
<Sabotender>	lol
<kbw>	Windows is nothing
<Time-Warp>	oh snap
<bazhang>	ceil,  memorized!
<ceil>	lol
<sunstar>	lolo
<thomas_d>	if bazhang feels threatened by the topics I was bringing on here then that's fine I'm happy to part ways with this uhhh... throwback chat...

<Sabotender>	ugh but they are so expensive
<sunstar>	yup
<sunstar>	no idea why
<Sabotender>	and I would need at least 1000W to hold my computer + wireless router + cable modem
<Sabotender>	sunstar: the batteries in them are expensive
<sunstar>	the UPS's i own all have cheap lead acid batteries
<sunstar>	so i guess i just have old UPSseses
<Sabotender>	maybe. I am probably going to buy a refurbished one
<Sabotender>	or even one off craigslist
<racho>	Sabotender, enjoy your housefire then
<Sabotender>	that way I can just buy a new battery and it would be good as new
<Sabotender>	racho: rubbish
<Time-Warp>	has anyone ever wonderd what would happen if you connected 501988398493849328493284928 volts to a desktop computer
<sunstar>	i did that once. once the battery charged, the no power siren went off. couldnt get it to shut up untill the battery dieded
<racho>	Sabotender, indeed if you get a brand new battery it's cool..otherwise enjoy your housefire
<bazhang>	a year or two, buy a HOME battery
<bazhang>	and its solar powered

<Audioburn_work>	racho racho man
<Audioburn_work>	i want to be, a racho man
<Time-Warp>	zildjian: oh snap
<zildjian>	Time-Warp: I'd short out the unit by adding 110Volt AC to some lead anywhere, then get a new one via warranty.  Yes I was bad. I do'nt do that anymore tho
<Time-Warp>	they prob take it apart and be like WTF
<Time-Warp>	all the circuts be welded together in a massive blob
<sunstar>	i wonder if they can sue over something like that
<zildjian>	I just took the unit back to best buy and was like 'it's broke'
<zildjian>	but yeah not a good idea.
<Time-Warp>	poor device it was happy when it came out of the factory not knowing it was going to be fryed unknownly :(
<sunstar>	i miss costco's old return policy. buy a computer once and keep exchanging it for a new one every year
<zildjian>	homedepot is like that
<zildjian>	you can buy almost anything and return it
<zildjian>	though you can't do it a lot or they will ban you from returning stuff

<Fowler>	No
<Fowler>	Using the speakers on my phone
<tortib>	oh
<tortib>	not sure
<tortib>	I would think so yes
<Fowler>	That's what I'm thinking
<tortib>	it's going to use some power but I don't think it would use much
<Fowler>	My left thumb and pointer finger hurt so bad
<tortib>	you're probably using more energy to play the actual music player

<Kimmey>	treefiddy_: I won't be taking pills no matter what :c
<Kimmey>	W would help but there's no money :'D we got to the point where pills are less expensive and more freaking dangerous what a fun world uh
<treefiddy_>	i dont blame you. im over those
<treefiddy_>	ahh i gotcha. yeah i have a um...

*	Kimmey taking treefiddy_ to the dark side
<Kimmey>	we have W cookies
<Kimmey>	:p
<treefiddy_>	they can back track that shit
<Kimmey>	yeah USA are very restrict with those
<treefiddy_>	and the chp comes by sometimes to run the dogs through the hub
<diogenese>	They do that?
<Kimmey>	treefiddy_ yeap :\
<treefiddy_>	diogenese: yeah definitely. i used to see them weekly at the w.sac hub
<Kimmey>	treefiddy_ although I've seen they doing something very WOW at darknet lol
<treefiddy_>	which is a major regional hub
<treefiddy_>	but to a lesser extent they show up at the smaller package centers too
<treefiddy_>	but if you see how it works, a ton of packages go through the major hubs
<Kimmey>	treefiddy_ they won't be doing it to small letters, would they ? :o
<treefiddy_>	Kimmey: they just run the dog down the line of packages
<treefiddy_>	size doesnt matter (tm)
<Kimmey>	treefiddy_: geez.
<diogenese>	I know they get really mad if you cross state lines. A friend's spending time for that right now, but he drove it across.
*	Kimmey sends a swiss cheese along LOL
<treefiddy_>	diogenese: yeah definitely. i mean people do it and get away with it
<treefiddy_>	but people get caught too
<TaZeR>	my mom came to me with her laptop today so infected with virii it heart me deep inside of my heart
<TaZeR>	hurt*
<TaZeR>	my mom pcs...
<TaZeR>	i mean mom pcs...
<diogenese>	At the same time, if you see cops in your back yard checking out your plants, it's not big deal.
<diogenese>	*no
<swift110-phone>	Aw
<treefiddy_>	as long as you have your paperwork yea
<swift110-phone>	Can u get her on Linux
<Kimmey>	so ofc would be easier to grow your own stuff
*	Kimmey has, yet again its illegal here
<diogenese>	With a script you can grow up to 20 plants here.
<Kimmey>	LOL
<Kimmey>	that would be more then enough
<Kimmey>	xD
<diogenese>	Way too much. Imagine trying to consume all that by yourself in a year.
<Kimmey>	ahm
*	Kimmey *cof*
<Kimmey>	it would depend of what trip you're growing, but yeah, if we're talking about BB that would be a lot
<treefiddy_>	with a yeild of 4 - 10lbs per plant?
<treefiddy_>	even a 4lb/plant that's 80lbs
<diogenese>	At least. They love sunshine.
<treefiddy_>	how the hell is anyone going to use up 80lbs
<treefiddy_>	even turning it all into wax
*	Kimmey doesn't understand lbs - googling
<diogenese>	2.2lb in a kg
<Kimmey>	thats a lot
<swift110-phone>	Ok
<treefiddy_>	yeah so 40ish Kg
<Kimmey>	but that would be BB
<Kimmey>	because its rare that a single plant will be giving you 4lb
<treefiddy_>	no
<treefiddy_>	not even
<treefiddy_>	not for outdoor
<Kimmey>	rightt
<Kimmey>	wait
<Kimmey>	so with the script you get there
<Kimmey>	you're actually able to grow outdoors ?
<diogenese>	Like I said, they love sunshine. Yes
<treefiddy_>	yeah haha
<Kimmey>	f@cking hell
<Kimmey>	california you siad ?
<treefiddy_>	it's a racket
<Kimmey>	said *
<treefiddy_>	lol yea
*	Kimmey moving immediately
<Kimmey>	:|
<treefiddy_>	there's no water this year
<treefiddy_>	so idk how it'ss going to work out
<diogenese>	We have water
<treefiddy_>	they're all freaking out
<swift110-phone>	Ok
<Kimmey>	OH RIGHT
<Kimmey>	WAIT
<treefiddy_>	reduce consumption by 35%
<treefiddy_>	but we'll let starbucks and nestle fill water bottles and ship them out of the state
<treefiddy_>	but no farmers, you can't grow
<Kimmey>	thats arnold schwarzenegger as president right ?
<diogenese>	I live in the northern part of the state. Mountains, rivers and streams.
<norkle>	you dont like starbucks?
<treefiddy_>	i like starbucks
<norkle>	oh
<treefiddy_>	i do not like them filling water bottles and shipping them out of the state
<diogenese>	He can't run for president. Not born here.
<treefiddy_>	when we're in a 4yr drought
<norkle>	tru dat.
<Kimmey>	I thought he was the president
<Kimmey>	lol
<norkle>	i thinking bout sending bottled water to heathrow airport.
<swift110-phone>	Lol
<treefiddy_>	he used to be the govenor Kimmey
<Kimmey>	I bet he did that
<Kimmey>	:p
<Kimmey>	xD
<swift110-phone>	Vrkalak what ya doin
<diogenese>	Now he just makes bad movies. Lot's of them.
<treefiddy_>	diogenese: the new terminator looks good though

<treefiddy_>	hey MojaveBoy666
<MojaveBoy666>	sup
<LauraCottonTail>	Hi
<MojaveBoy666>	hi laura :)
<swift110-phone>	Hey lauracottontail
<binaryhermit>	actually, Ted Cruz wasn't born here and he might be eligible to be president
<binaryhermit>	apparently Obama's mother wasn't eligible to pass on her citizenship to him under the laws of the time because she hadn't lived in the US for long enough after her 14th birthday, but that's a moot point because he was born in the USA
<MojaveBoy666>	wasn't he born in canada?
<binaryhermit>	yes, Ted Cruz was born in Canada
<MojaveBoy666>	how is he eligible then?
<treefiddy_>	he has dual citizenship
<MojaveBoy666>	i thought that's why Former Governor Arnold S. (not gonna try to spell his last name) wasn't running, because he wasn't born in the USA
<treefiddy_>	yeah he has 0 citizenship
<binaryhermit>	if ted cruz's mother had lived in the us for 10 years, 5 after her 14th birthday, he's eligible
<Kimmey>	all execuses because he was a cool guy who smoked weed and belonged to the hollywood industries xD
<binaryhermit>	treefiddy_: actually, I think he's a naturalized citizen
<binaryhermit>	still not eligible
<binaryhermit>	ted cruz may not be an american citizen
<treefiddy_>	eep
<binaryhermit>	since he was never naturalized
*	YonicWitch_ is now known as CosmicWitch
<LauraCottonTail>	Why don't I know who Ted Cruz is
<diogenese>	Lucky
<LauraCottonTail>	I heard his name but idk
<binaryhermit>	he's a teatard that's running for president
<binaryhermit>	who may not be eligible to be president
<LauraCottonTail>	Ok
<treefiddy_>	a US senator or something
<binaryhermit>	from Dumbestfuckistan
<LauraCottonTail>	But there is no way republicans will win anything soon right?
<treefiddy_>	yeah not a cool guy
<treefiddy_>	they might this election
<LauraCottonTail>	So the conversation is over
<treefiddy_>	people are pissed
<LauraCottonTail>	Pffff
<swift110-phone>	Lol
<LauraCottonTail>	It's going to be Hilary
<LauraCottonTail>	By people you mean people in your village treefiddy
<hmir>	Can't have a woman in charge.
*	binaryhermit hopes hillary isn't the democratic nominee
<hmir>	Although I'd like to get her elected so she can blow someone in the oval office and say it wasn't sex!
<treefiddy_>	lol yes laura... the angry villagers. and they're storming my castle right now
<binaryhermit>	I'd rather have Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren
<treefiddy_>	hillary has too much controversy
<treefiddy_>	unless she's got a really good campaign
<LauraCottonTail>	She will win for sure
<treefiddy_>	she wont even get picked by the dems to be the candidate
<treefiddy_>	not after this bengazi crap and the email server
<treefiddy_>	she's sketchy
<hmir>	What email server?
<LauraCottonTail>	No one serious will want to face her in the democrate nomination race
<treefiddy_>	her private email server she had in her house
*	MojaveBoy666 needs to register to vote
<LauraCottonTail>	No one
<treefiddy_>	that she used for official coms
<LauraCottonTail>	So she'll win
<treefiddy_>	that she flattened when they asked for access
<LauraCottonTail>	And then it will be her or J’arrive ! Bush
<binaryhermit>	jeb bushitler's top foreign policy advisor is george w. bushitler
<Equinoxdawg>	is J’arrive french or something
*	binaryhermit shudders
<LauraCottonTail>	How come I know that and you Americans don't
<treefiddy_>	you're speculating
<LauraCottonTail>	It's just that your tv shows and newspaper want to make money so they pretend it's not all set
<treefiddy_>	you can't _know_ the outcome of a future event like that
<LauraCottonTail>	Two words treefiddy_
<LauraCottonTail>	Nate silver
<LauraCottonTail>	Well when its that biased it's easier
<ceil>	lol
<treefiddy_>	idk what nate silver is
<ceil>	funny how LCT is making these claims days after the uk elections blew so many minds
<treefiddy_>	but im bored, and im wandering off
<LauraCottonTail>	ceil:  Nate silver has said too close to call
<LauraCottonTail>	For UK
<LauraCottonTail>	Also it's harder to predict in the UK because more than one party
<LauraCottonTail>	The Scottish party has buldozered in Scotland
<LauraCottonTail>	And all candidates were just awful
<CosmicWitch>	hi ceil :)
<binaryhermit>	well, the mentally retarded party won the election in the UK
<ceil>	so are all the us republican candidates, but someone's gotta win the primary
<CosmicWitch>	I hope scotland gains independence
<binaryhermit>	since conservative is just a euphemism for mentally retarded
<CosmicWitch>	someday
<ceil>	o/
<CosmicWitch>	then the tories can dominate whats left of the UK and run it into the ground
<CosmicWitch>	when scotland isn't around to shift the government in a reasonable direction
<CosmicWitch>	why is england in love with tories
<ceil>	CosmicWitch: don't think the tories will wait on the scots
<CosmicWitch>	they are so destructive
<binaryhermit>	I'll be back later
<CosmicWitch>	;-;
<Kimmey>	treefiddy_ wut bored? w-why, h-how?! I'm so funny xD

<LauraCottonTail>	It has to be Jeb bush

<CosmicWitch>	his plans will go nowhere, he has no hope
<Sabotender>	moo 🐮
<LauraCottonTail>	Apparently he is eloquent enough.
<LauraCottonTail>	Against Hilary no
<LauraCottonTail>	But he might win the primary
<CosmicWitch>	but republicans dont even like him
<ceil>	lol
<CosmicWitch>	I highly doubt he will win any primaries
<LauraCottonTail>	He has tons of support in higher spheres
<CosmicWitch>	those people are not loved in the primaries
<LauraCottonTail>	Hmmm Idk I only heard he was the most likely to
<CosmicWitch>	the establishment is a bad word to primary voters
<LauraCottonTail>	We'll see
<CosmicWitch>	it looked like that on paper
<CosmicWitch>	but he is really weak in practice
<CosmicWitch>	the guy doesnt have a good personality

<CosmicWitch>	you mean the thing you just talked about doing
<LauraCottonTail>	In the U.S. Painkillers are strong strong stuff
<treefiddy_>	for taking tylenol?
<CosmicWitch>	so obviously you are talking about yourself there
<treefiddy_>	no this is over the counter
<LauraCottonTail>	I had Tylenol pm once I slept for 22 hours
<CosmicWitch>	well thats not judgemental at all...
<CosmicWitch>	lol
<forks>	i sucked on a fentanil lolly once for about 15 seconds
<CosmicWitch>	woah dude fentanyl lolipop
<forks>	10 minutes later i didn't know who or where i was
<CosmicWitch>	D:
<CosmicWitch>	jesus!
<LauraCottonTail>	CosmicWitch: do you have an issue with me?
<treefiddy_>	nothx
<LauraCottonTail>	I thought we were cool
<joze>	We are the cooles hood in the freenodes
<forks>	don't like most of that stuff though, makes my skin crawl
<CosmicWitch>	:P
<forks>	joze: not saying much there
<forks>	i'm the hottest guy at the weight watchers meetup
<treefiddy_>	you gotta be cool man
<treefiddy_>	you gotta let the chill settle into your vertebrae
<LauraCottonTail>	Stupid periods.
<forks>	overshare
<treefiddy_>	so the weather today was nice
<treefiddy_>	sequay into next topic here:
<treefiddy_>	why is my finger hitting the q instead of the g
<treefiddy_>	that's a wiring issue
<codehunter2000>	or it's the fentanil lolly
<Kimmey>	LOL
<treefiddy_>	i am a little bitty lollipop
<Kimmey>	LOOOL
<LauraCottonTail>	Faking back Asleep
<treefiddy_>	faker
<CosmicWitch>	take some more fancy painkillers that somehow arent real drugs because we only get those over here
<forks>	staying here chatting
<CosmicWitch>	according to what you said
<treefiddy_>	i like pie
<forks>	i'm a butter fan myself
<codehunter2000>	pie is good
<LauraCottonTail>	CosmicWitch: will you stop attacking me for no reason
<codehunter2000>	butter is better
<forks>	why go through all that trouble and eat all that sugar when you can just eat the butter directly?
<codehunter2000>	butter lolly?
<forks>	have you ever put butter on an apple?
<CosmicWitch>	just cook half a cup of butter and half a cup of sugar in a pan
<CosmicWitch>	with a couple of drops of vanilla
<CosmicWitch>	to 380 deg F
<forks>	>cook
<CosmicWitch>	yes cook it
<CosmicWitch>	then it turns into toffee
<CosmicWitch>	lol!
<forks>	so much trouble
<LauraCottonTail>	Falling* back asleep
<LauraCottonTail>	I meant
<treefiddy_>	nite
<forks>	noted
<forks>	it's like that song lime in the coconut
<forks>	except butter on the apple
<codehunter2000>	butter on apple sound gross
<forks>	well you could core it and put the butter inside with a tablespoon of sugar and a dash of cinnamon and bake it
<forks>	but that's for idk, not busy people
<codehunter2000>	personally i prefer to husk strawberries and fill them with chocolate syrup, but that's just me
<forks>	that syrup stuff is gross, usually like 90% hfc
<forks>	but melted chocolate would be great
<codehunter2000>	or use peanut butter cups if the strawberries are big enough
<forks>	wat
<treefiddy_>	it melts in your mouth not in your hands
<forks>	peanuts vs strawberries is not a battle i want in my mouth
<treefiddy_>	haha
<treefiddy_>	how about
<CosmicWitch>	I'm loving shit cooked in peanut sauce
<treefiddy_>	lol
<codehunter2000>	but it so delicious...
<treefiddy_>	bag of m&m's
<treefiddy_>	bag of reeces
<treefiddy_>	all in a bowl
<treefiddy_>	with skittles
<forks>	jes evil
<treefiddy_>	that's not even my most evil plan
<codehunter2000>	that would throw me into a homicidal rage
<codehunter2000>	chocolate and skittles
<forks>	for a while i used to draw spiders on all the toilet paper rolls
<treefiddy_>	lol nice
<codehunter2000>	now that's funny
<treefiddy_>	ok so here goes
<treefiddy_>	Go to a bar or somewhere with one of those jukeboxes
<treefiddy_>	spend a couple bucks in it, and play What's New Pussycat - Tom Jones
<treefiddy_>	not once
<treefiddy_>	not twice
<treefiddy_>	but seven times in a row
<treefiddy_>	sec
<forks>	lool
<treefiddy_>	ok, so as you go through ti with the listener in mind
<treefiddy_>	it kind of fades out at the end and picks up into the next song
<treefiddy_>	so they might think it's just a long pause
<treefiddy_>	but after the 2nd or 3rd time they're going to start to wonder what's going on
<treefiddy_>	and by the 7th, they';re going to be pissed
<treefiddy_>	but you've already queued the next few songs as well
<codehunter2000>	then they burn the jukebox
<treefiddy_>	the 8th song? Tom Jones - It's not unusual
<treefiddy_>	still tom jones
<treefiddy_>	but at least its a different song right?
<forks>	it'd require the right juke box
<treefiddy_>	so the tempers start to go down
<treefiddy_>	9th song?
<treefiddy_>	What's new pussycat
<treefiddy_>	be out of the bar by this poitn
<codehunter2000>	kill it with fire
<forks>	the old ones will only let you pick like 3 or so songs
<treefiddy_>	yah but i guess these new digital ones you can queue up pretty good
<diogenese>	That's actually older than me. My mom's music. She loved Tom Jones.
<treefiddy_>	yeah diogenese
<treefiddy_>	i didnt make that one up though, i read it on something. im sure if you search for the tom jones insane bar or something it'll pop up
<forks>	sure way to get your ass beat, at least
<diogenese>	We'd put on Frank Sinatra just before last call when I tended bar.
<forks>	sinatra is at least timelessly classic
<treefiddy_>	thats why i said get outtaq the bar haha
<treefiddy_>	sinatra is good
<diogenese>	The crew loved him, but the college kids got the hint quick. Hardly had to chase people off.
<treefiddy_>	haha i bet
<treefiddy_>	though i do like a cover of My Way by the sex pistols too though
<forks>	bar i went to would always play that uh... closing time song
<forks>	semisonic i think
<codehunter2000>	any plans for mother's day?
<forks>	too apt
<treefiddy_>	im going to cook my mom dinner
<treefiddy_>	how about you?
<treefiddy_>	i didnt realize until today that it's this weekend haha
<codehunter2000>	Going out to brunch after church. Best I can manage with finals and such... You making something fancy?
<LauraCottonTail>	It's the 31st in France
<CosmicWitch>	thats lovely co
<CosmicWitch>	codehunter2000,
<treefiddy_>	she hasn't told me what she wants yet. i told her anything. im a halfway decent cook
<treefiddy_>	i can follow a recipe anyway
<codehunter2000>	thanks CosmicWitch
<CosmicWitch>	:)
<LauraCottonTail>	Make her a chocolate fondant with butterscotch sauce and toffee pop corns
<codehunter2000>	treefiddy allrecipies is your friend ;)
<treefiddy_>	agreed, i like that one and the food network one
<treefiddy_>	except altons. he makes great stuff, but he goes overboard sometimes
<codehunter2000>	toffee popcorn? mmmmmm
<codehunter2000>	agreed regarding alton. never really cared for him much
<treefiddy_>	i liked his show, i like the science of it
<treefiddy_>	but he did go pretty out of the way for ingredients
<codehunter2000>	that's how i learned chemistry ; )
<treefiddy_>	haha nice
<CosmicWitch>	you should make her something that she likes
<codehunter2000>	I had some emeril recipes that were pretty bomb  but the ingredients were ridiculous
<CosmicWitch>	I think Ill make my mom some pecan pralines
<codehunter2000>	I know banana crunch french toast has always been a hit with my mom
<CosmicWitch>	oh!
<CosmicWitch>	dude, no brainer
<CosmicWitch>	do that!
<forks>	jacques pepin has a lot of really dank but simple recipes on his site
<forks>	surprisingly
<treefiddy_>	nice
<treefiddy_>	i like those
<forks>	a lot of them call for expensive ingredients, but sometimes there are suggestions for alternatives
<hmir>	I bet she had lots of selfie nudies on her private email server.
<hmir>	TRhat's when she destroyed it.
<forks>	like the cauliflower gratin (my parents love it), calls for gruyere cheese, but you can just use emmentaler or generic "swiss"
<treefiddy_>	nice
<diogenese>	Funny, was just making a dish for my father. Well, his bday party tomorrow.
<treefiddy_>	yeah i had something like that once. cauliflower mash? i guess a carb free alternative to mashed potatos
<forks>	probably gonna grill some tuna steaks do the cauliflower gratin and maybe some asparagus or something
<codehunter2000>	now i have a sudden yen to grill some salmon
<codehunter2000>	ya'll make me hungry
<treefiddy_>	you're welcome
<treefiddy_>	now you get to enjoy tasty salmon
<hmir>	yuck
<coldsparrow>	yuck fuck

<introvert->	thats the problem.
<introvert->	well i have a guy that basicly does everything i say. but he cant see me like this.
<treefiddy_>	oh that's easy
<treefiddy_>	make him hand it through the door
<introvert->	man oh man.

<treefiddy_>	the shade is probably not right
<introvert->	yeah it was supposed to be dark purple.
<introvert->	it is BRIGHT AS FUCK PINK AND I HATE IT.
<hmir>	I had my purple hair professionally done.
<introvert->	i'm usually really good at hair, i don't know what happened.
<introvert->	but i'm just gunna go back blonde and probably never dye it again.
<treefiddy_>	poor performing product?
<introvert->	yes.
<hmir>	(and people still thought it looked pink/red when It clearly was not)
<hmir>	So maybe it's just a perception issue?
<treefiddy_>	it looked purple to me
<treefiddy_>	it's like that dress hmir
<treefiddy_>	post your hair pic
<treefiddy_>	maybe you'll start another viral thingy about the color
<introvert->	LOL
<introvert->	damnit.

<introvert->	but i'm back. hi.

<forks>	so buy the purple, lol?
<introvert->	mines down to like the middle of my back.
<introvert->	and pink.
<treefiddy_>	Donate to locks of love
<introvert->	and everyones hair takes differently. but i had to bleach it like 3 times to even get it light enough.
<forks>	ah, that's a lot of time growing and tending it
<introvert->	then buhhbam. pink.
<forks>	i'd have to do the hard hairspray punk spikes all over my head to pull off pink
<forks>	otherwise i'd have a idk, jewfro
<introvert->	LOL.
<hmir>	treefiddy_; you shave your head?
<treefiddy_>	sweet
<treefiddy_>	i dont bic it anymore hmir
<hmir>	I got mine cut down to like half an inch now.
<introvert->	i wish i had the balls to cut my hair all off.
<treefiddy_>	but i use a #000000 shaver
<hmir>	I go the barber and tell him to use a machine with an 8 number clip.
<hmir>	End of story.
<treefiddy_>	they call it a "balding razor"
<forks>	i have moles on my head
<introvert->	really?
<hmir>	You can't have moles on your head?
<introvert->	i have one on my chest.
<hmir>	I have plenty of moles.
<introvert->	well my boob.
<forks>	i'd look like a bloody mess if i tried to shave my head
<introvert->	i can't even.
<introvert->	shave around them?
<treefiddy_>	you cant really
<hmir>	I have a mole on my cheek.
<treefiddy_>	not very well
<forks>	maybe some barber could
<hmir>	And i just shave over it. Never ever had a problem.
<introvert->	i'll do it.
<treefiddy_>	a barber yea
<forks>	but then i'd have a bald head with moles and it'd look funny
<introvert->	but if i cut it off, im charging you for plastic surgery.
<treefiddy_>	you're gonna bleed man
<hmir>	I have one on my upper lip too. Again, I just shave over it.
<treefiddy_>	melanoma
*	treefiddy_ ducks

<forks>	well, i can really relate, introvert-

<treefiddy_>	with an e-girlfriend
<introvert->	i'd be a wonderful lesbian.
<binaryhermit>	and say that e-president bush e-doesn't e-care about e-black people
<introvert->	if i didn't have such a bad attitude.

<wilkgr>	Hah
<wilkgr>	Nope
<hmir>	A nice inviting bed.
<wilkgr>	Or is a bus a SUV or a ute?
<treefiddy_>	neither
<wilkgr>	Last time I checked, it wasn´t
<treefiddy_>	it's a longer vehicle
<treefiddy_>	with more seats
<wilkgr>	A Mec 6x6 would be nice, eh?
<hubik>	I'm on the bus :D
<wilkgr>	*Merc
*	Sabotender hugs hmir 
*	wilkgr kicks hubik
*	hmir hugs Sabotender
*	wilkgr pries the two apart
<hubik>	I'm on the bus and you can't get me off
<wilkgr>	No, but I can crush the bus with the 6x6
<wilkgr>	(Maybe)
<hubik>	the bus is huge man
<wilkgr>	It weighs 3 3/4 (the merc)
<wilkgr>	A crane is helpful, hubik
<treefiddy_>	a greyhound bus
<wilkgr>	I´ll stand by my cannons even if I´ve got no ammo, ok?
<hubik>	my pinzgauer is already half way up the mountain
<wilkgr>	My 6x6 is very cool, and its a ute
<treefiddy_>	that's not a good strategy
<wilkgr>	It´s 6 wheel drive, mate
<treefiddy_>	you should either forage for ammo
<treefiddy_>	or take cover
<wilkgr>	I know
<wilkgr>	But a 6x6 is superior to a bus
<hubik>	hmm, nice alp
<wilkgr>	It´s a G-wagon, so it´s better offroad, it´s faster, got better traction because of 6 wheel drive
<hmir>	thang!
<wilkgr>	1-nil to the G-wagon
<hubik>	you know what really grinds my gears
<hmir>	It ain't nothing but a g-wagn thang bayeebaY!
<wilkgr>	¨nothing but a g-wagon¨
<wilkgr>	That´s depreciation
<wilkgr>	that is
<hubik>	75.14 KiB/s !!!
<hmir>	89854 KiB/s
<wilkgr>	A g-wagon is better than some ´ol bus
<hubik>	brrrrr
<hmir>	A scooter is better than a g-wagon
<wilkgr>	Why?
<wilkgr>	It´s not faster....It´s not as good offroad...The G-wagon is better
<hubik>	i'm nearly curious
<hmir>	Nope!
<hmir>	A scooter is like a monster on two wheels!
<wilkgr>	The G-wagon has ¨supercar perfomance in something the size of a shopping centre¨ ~Richard Hammond on the G-wagon 6x6
<lala>	Hi.
<lala>	How is everyone?
<wilkgr>	Do you like the merc 6x6?

<hmir>	life without chocolate is a life not worth living!
<lala>	I'm not a cocophile.
<lala>	Lol.
<lala>	What is your favorite chocolate flavor?
<lala>	I like dark chocolate ... Medium dark chocolate.
<lala>	Semi-sweet.
<lala>	What about you?
<hubik>	lalalalalalalala
<treefiddy_>	um
<treefiddy_>	i like up to about a 60% cacao dark chocolate
<hubik>	hmir is a coconut :o
<hmir>	Is it just me of against me not a good band?
<tortib>	I feel like my insides are going to explode
<lala>	hubik: Hello!
<hmir>	they get a lot of attention because of the frontman/woman gender trasformation, but the music is just rubbish to me.
<lala>	hmir: You haven't told me what chocolate you like!
<treefiddy_>	idk i never heard em
<hmir>	I like ALL chocolate!
<treefiddy_>	yay
<lala>	tortib: Hello.

<tortib>	hey
<treefiddy_>	lala herro
<lala>	tortib: Do you remember me? I remember you.
<tortib>	Your name seems familiar
<lala>	I remember you too treefiddy_
<treefiddy_>	I am memorable!
<lala>	tortib: My nickname or my real name?
<introvert->	no.
<tortib>	I don't know your real name
<treefiddy_>	yes
<introvert->	no.
<treefiddy_>	you're going to dream about me in about 17.33
<treefiddy_>	 minutes
<lala>	tortib: I dont think I've ever told my real name.
<introvert->	im awake now.
<tortib>	lala, then how would I know your real name?
<hmir>	i remember treefiddy_ too
<lala>	tortib: Exactly!
<treefiddy_>	i remember too! he's a jerk! get him
<hmir>	But i will drink bleach to forget
<lala>	hmir: I'm going to remember you as the chocolate man.
<tortib>	treefiddy_, you talking about yourself?
<hmir>	lala; good call. I'm chocolate.
<hmir>	For reasons other than chocolate consumption!
<lala>	treefiddy_: How are you doing?
<treefiddy_>	lala: im doing well, how are you?
<lala>	treefiddy_: I'm feeling great!
<lala>	What is your local time?
<tortib>	I'm so tired, but I can't sleep because of anxiety
<treefiddy_>	2am
<lala>	What?!?!
<treefiddy_>	almost time for good little boys to go to bed
<lala>	That's late.
<treefiddy_>	or early *WINK*
<tortib>	treefiddy_, I hope you die soon
<lala>	tortib: Be nice.
<treefiddy_>	tortib: thank you.
<tortib>	lala, I have absolutely no reason to be nice.
<treefiddy_>	he doesn't
<lala>	tortib: That should not imply that you have a reason not to be nice.
<tortib>	lala, You have not lived my life
<tortib>	lala, so you just don't know
<lala>	tortib: How hard could it be?
<tortib>	apparently very difficult
<treefiddy_>	lala: he's just mad at the world and looking for an e-fight. i took pity on him last night and gave him one. but idk, kinda boring
<tortib>	treefiddy_, heh, i'm mad at people who have done this to me
<tortib>	I have every right to be mad at the world
<treefiddy_>	sure you can do that
<treefiddy_>	or
<lala>	tortib: Mad at the world? That sounds naive.
<treefiddy_>	fix it and move on
<tortib>	treefiddy_, how the fuck am I going to fix it?
<treefiddy_>	magic dust
<lala>	Watch your language.
<lala>	And dri
<lala>	Drink cold water.
<lala>	Or wash your face with cold water.
<tortib>	I'm drinking chamomile
<tortib>	trying to calm down
<lala>	Or shower in cold water.
<lala>	Chamomile?
<tortib>	yea
<lala>	I've never heard of that before.
<tortib>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamomile
<tortib>	lala, you would be surprised what I can teach you
<lala>	I'm excited.
<lala>	Please do.
<tortib>	What do I get in return?
<lala>	It looks like a plant.
<lala>	Hmm...
<tortib>	It's a flower
<lala>	That's for you to decide.
<treefiddy_>	now that, ladies and gentlemen, is what is known as an open ended statement.
<tortib>	lala, I have a couple things in mind.
<lala>	Yeap. Open ended.
<lala>	Uh.
<lala>	And what would that be?
<lala>	Just letting you know, I'll be the one who approves or denies your request.
<tortib>	Then you wont get any teachings
<lala>	I have every right to deny a request.
<lala>	You have every right to waste energy by getting mad at the world. But we can fix that.
<tortib>	How?
<lala>	How? Well I'm sure that's an answer only you can find.
<tortib>	if you can fix that how can I find the answer?
<lala>	I said "we".
<lala>	That includes you.
<lala>	treefiddy_: I think it's turning into argument about nothing.
<tortib>	Would be a good episode of Seinfeld
<lala>	I've never watched Seinfeld.
<treefiddy_>	lala yeppers
<tortib>	lala, meh, you're not missing much
<tortib>	lala, it was literally a show about nothing
<gamma>	It's pretty great. A lot of absolute classics.
<tortib>	mostly jerry seinfeld complaining
<lala>	treefiddy_: Yeppers! I also use that word!
<gamma>	the one with the talk show set it hilarious
<gamma>	is*
<treefiddy_>	i didnt watch it until after it was in syndication
<treefiddy_>	i think its on my list of shows to watch from beginning to end
<tortib>	gamma, I think my personal favorite is when jerry and george pitch nbc about their show about nothing on the show about nothing
<tortib>	gamma, a form of recursion if you will
<lala>	Syndication.
<tortib>	lala, so what can we do to fix this?
<hmir>	Reboooooooooooooot!
<lala>	tortib: Well... There are many ways.
<tortib>	This tea isn't doing shit
<lala>	Who said it needs to do something?
<tortib>	well i would like my anxiety to go away
<lala>	tortib: Do you have anger related issues?
<tortib>	It isn't really anger
<tortib>	it's more frustration
<lala>	Oh.
<lala>	You need more experience.
<tortib>	How is experience going to relive anxiety and frustration?
<lala>	Well if you've experienced the world more than you have now, you'll come to find the late your problems are merely superficial. Such realizations come to your senses at the moment of experience.
<tortib>	my problems are not superfical
<tortib>	and my problems have been imposed upon me by other people
<tortib>	I didn't create my problems, other people created them for me
<lala>	Mostly everyone's problems are superficial.
<tortib>	and I know you're going to say, "Oh you can't blame other people for your problems".
<lala>	The real problems are large scale.
<tortib>	But that is pure bullshit
<lala>	How so?
<Equinoxdawg>	tortib: what are your problems?
<tortib>	Equinoxdawg, I don't want to get into it
<tortib>	Equinoxdawg, how is your site coming along?
<lala>	Why not?
<tortib>	Because there isn't anything I can do about it?
<lala>	Why assume that?
<tortib>	I hate where I live
<lala>	Move to some other place.
<tortib>	I can't or else I would
<tortib>	I'm being held prisoner
<lala>	By whom?
<tortib>	the government
<Equinoxdawg>	tortib: err, bad. I found a way to get what I want from Angular Material's site but it's a mess, so I have to wait for 0.10.0 or not have what I was trying to do.
<lala>	Consult the government.

<tortib>	then dynamic websites came around
<tortib>	stuff got complex
<tortib>	I made some stuff, created some MORE ideas
<Branes>	Berners-Lee made a thing of beauty. Then geeks got their hands on it.
<tortib>	people stole it of course
<tortib>	no credit given
<lala>	tortib: Your ideas?

<lala>	tortib: What kind of ideas?
<tortib>	websites where the content is created by the users

<tortib>	facebook?  twitter? any website where the user is the content
<lala>	tortib: Oh. Okay. So what's the next idea?
<tortib>	I'm out of ideas
<lala>	Why?!?!?!
<tortib>	because I have no inspiration?

<tortib>	nobody cares about the complex stuff either apparently
<lala>	What makes you say that?
<tortib>	Because the way I have been treated

<lala>	tortib: It wasn't supposed to be easy!

<tastybuds>	do you like this puppy? http://oi57.tinypic.com/2uqomev.jpg
<Equinoxdawg>	depends what spices it is cooked with
<tastybuds>	you broke ma heart rly
<Sabotender>	looks like a cute puppy, but it also looks like its going to turn out to be a gigantic dog
<Romance>	wtf my kitten jumped on my jeans and he climbed my shirt and sleep on my shoulder
<DarkUranium>	lol
<Romance>	i need to bath these kittens but i guess they are still 1 month old
<Romance>	is it ok?
<H2O1>	why do cats sleep all the time?
<H2O1>	housecats i mean
<H2O1>	in the wild cat have to hunt out their dinner
<H2O1>	*cats
<H2O1>	THERE IS NO FREE MEAL IN THE WILD
<RUBICN64>	technically there is... a dead animal
<Romance>	H2O1: because they have nowhere to go wild
<Romance>	house is like a big prison for cats, they got served free meals
<Romance>	and we are the slave have to feed and cleam them shits
<DarkUranium>	it's hardly a prison when they can wander outside whenever they want
<Romance>	clean
<H2O1>	if you threw a domestic cat in the wild he could probably not survive on its own
<DarkUranium>	H2O1, AFAIK, it mostly just has to do with them being really efficient hunters
<DarkUranium>	H2O1, only about 25% of the prey they catch gets brought home.
<DarkUranium>	25% gets eaten, 50% gets left to rot
<DarkUranium>	and our cat just goes outside for the shitty bits.
<H2O1>	housecats as kittens are never taught by their mother how to chase a prey
<DarkUranium>	H2O1, meh, I know plenty of neighbours have cats that were never taught how to chase pray
<DarkUranium>	and said neighbours usually don't feed their cats (what can I say, dumb farmer or farmer-like folk)... yet, those cats still manage to get by.
<DarkUranium>	(and hunt)
<H2O1>	throw a housecat in the middle of a bunch of rats and he would starve to death
<DarkUranium>	right.
<H2O1>	rats are dangerous to hunt DANGER
<grayC>	my cats kill snakes
<grayC>	most of the time they are asleep and then viola there is a snake in the kitchen
<H2O1>	eventually the snake will smother your cat and that will be the end of him
<DarkUranium>	grayC, yeah, many cats do (not all, but many)
<DarkUranium>	birds, mice, rats, snakes ... really just about anything smaller than themselves
<grayC>	they like to bring them inside half alive its pretty distrubing
<DarkUranium>	grayC, our cat used to bring living mice into the house
<DarkUranium>	grayC, let them loose in the house ... and then *ran away* from said micde
<DarkUranium>	(or actually, was actively running away while the mice was alive, as if the mice was the hunter now)
<grayC>	yea i dont mind the mice so much as the deadly poisinous snakes
<H2O1>	tsk tsk
<grayC>	they put the last one in my shoe
<DarkUranium>	good thing poisonous snakes don't exist!
<DarkUranium>	(snakes are venomous)
*	DarkUranium ducks!
<DarkUranium>	speaking of snakes, just been to a reptile zoo today ...
<grayC>	cool
<DarkUranium>	one of the green mambas was sleeping on the side, kind of like a cat xD
<DarkUranium>	(and black mambas are handsome!9
<grayC>	i like all the snakes except the brown ones
<DarkUranium>	(wouldn't want to run into one in the wild, though)
<DarkUranium>	and adders were freaking hyperactive
<DarkUranium>	grayC, what do you mean "brown ones"?
<grayC>	eastern brown snake
<DarkUranium>	ah
<grayC>	thats generally what they bring into the kitchen
<DarkUranium>	wonderful lol
<grayC>	yea lol
<DarkUranium>	grayC, today for dinner: broiled snake stew!
<grayC>	and then i cant get out the back door to the garden implements to get somthing to kill it
<grayC>	so i usually have to hit it with a frypan
<DarkUranium>	hisssss
<grayC>	im sick of it im sick of it
<DarkUranium>	well, frypan's halfway to cooking.
<DarkUranium>	so you're on the right track
<grayC>	it was just lucky i looked at my sandals before i put them on a couple of weeks ago and this brown was all coiled around my shoe
<DarkUranium>	=\
<grayC>	see http://imgur.com/sH7VUrc
<DarkUranium>	grayC, how dangerous are those snakes?
<H2O1>	how much do you weight? just asking...
<DarkUranium>	grayC, yup, that's a snake alright.
<H2O1>	if you weigh 100kg youre fine to crush any snake
<grayC>	they have enough venom to kill about 5 people i think
<DarkUranium>	grayC, at least it isn't a Taipan! (they also had that at the petting ... I mean, reptile zoo)
<DarkUranium>	(I don't recall which one specifically though)
<H2O1>	where do you live grayC, in central Afrika?
<grayC>	then i kill him http://imgur.com/t1Q5co2
<grayC>	central australia
<H2O1>	ok
<H2O1>	crocrodile dundee stuff
<Gluesticky>	 Reported
<H2O1>	lots of sticky snakes
<H2O1>	they stick around
<H2O1>	bite you in your sleep
<H2O1>	you wake up on the other side
<H2O1>	heaven or hell
<grayC>	yea a brown snake bit me some years ago
<grayC>	its not very funny
<H2O1>	i suppose there exists an antivenom for every venom
<Gluesticky>	Will I have a peaceful death if I get bit in my sleep?
<grayC>	idk i was a long way from any help
<grayC>	no
<H2O1>	Gluesticky, you would probably not have a "peaceful" death at all with most venoms
<grayC>	why did you say Reported before Gluesticky
<DarkUranium>	grayC, well, can't you stock up on antivenom or something, since it's always one type of snake?
<grayC>	no
<DarkUranium>	that's a shame
<grayC>	idc if they bite me again im like come at me snake
<Romance>	do you guys prefer 10 degree celcius or 25 degree celcis
<DarkUranium>	H2O1, unless it's lead poisoning my means of supersonic slugs
<DarkUranium>	H2O1, but I guess that technically isn't a venom!
<Gluesticky>	25 degrees celsius is room temperature.
<DarkUranium>	25 is not room temperature.
<Gluesticky>	It is scientifically proven to be the most comfortable.
<DarkUranium>	Romance, and 10.
<H2O1>	20C is room temperature
<DarkUranium>	^
<grayC>	no the tv tells us to set our aircon to 25c
<grayC>	i dont have aircon tho
<DarkUranium>	Gluesticky, scientifically by who? Scientists from Haiti?
<grayC>	i have swamp coolers
<Romance>	i giggle when its 15 degree celcius
<Romance>	i dont think i could survive with half naked in 10c
<Gluesticky>	It changes apparently, that's what I learnt back at highschool.
<Gluesticky>	And university.
<DarkUranium>	grayC, well, of course TV only tells you the truth!
<grayC>	i cant cope with temp under 25c
<H2O1>	but in Australia is suppose its very dry heat, so easier to bear
<H2O1>	s/is/I/
<grayC>	humidity is bad in summer here
<H2O1>	omg
<grayC>	then i cant use the swamp cooler or the walls run with water
<grayC>	so i generally lie in the creek
<grayC>	you know when its over 40c

<jjs999jjs>	AnTi_MTtr,  why were you in my house?????
<hubik>	ooo
<CHVNX>	gamma: It is nice to see even freenode has its little Hitlers.
<AnTi_MTtr>	jjs999jjs: is your house a super computer center?
<jjs999jjs>	lol I wish
<AnTi_MTtr>	so do i
<Estr>	gamma, you seem to be logical and polite
<x2f>	CHVNX if you don't like the authoritarian rule of ##chat, come to ##chat-freedom
<Estr>	don't you see whats wrong?
<x2f>	only way to get banned is by spamming
*	ChanServ gives channel operator status to Ruby
*	Ruby sets ban on *!*@unaffiliated/chvnx
*	Ruby has kicked CHVNX from ##chat (Please do not spam. Thank you. If you have any questions please join ##chat-ops)
*	Ruby removes channel operator status from Ruby
<Estr>	wat
<Estr>	lol
<rosenberg>	wtf
<jjs999jjs>	hmm
<gamma>	I guess Ruby didn't like his use of the word "Hitler", either. :/
<gamma>	Or maybe she took offence at being called "little".
<gamma>	Who knows?
<Estr>	This is like real life
<x2f>	gamma, you can come to ##chat-freedom
<Estr>	Corrupted leaders and citizens who tries to make the better out of it
<gamma>	I'd rather not, and I'm pretty sure you've spammed your channel more than enough.
<Estr>	We don't pay with money though
<TightByte>	Estr, where do you live?
<Estr>	everything is payed with respect
<Estr>	I live in Norway, how come?
<TightByte>	Interesting.
<TightByte>	I do, too.
<x2f>	i didn't know "shitty" is a synonym for "new"
<x2f>	just started a minecraft server yesterday, and you're working on it? it's a shitty server!
<x2f>	i learned that this week
<TightByte>	I'm asking so as to establish any angle you might have on any perspective being discussed.
<TightByte>	Because context kind of matters.  Or so I'd like to argue, anyway.
<treefiddy_>	the angle of the dangle
<Estr>	I ask myself everytime I use this computer
<Estr>	Why the fuck am I arguing with people on the internet?
<Estr>	I could be doing so many productive things
<treefiddy_>	it's something to do to pass the time
<Estr>	instead of telling 538 people exactly what I'm thinking irght now
<treefiddy_>	it gives you unique perspective into their character
<treefiddy_>	oh there aren't that many humans here. they harbor a huge botnet in here
<Estr>	It's like being stuck in class with people you don't like
<gamma>	Estr: You can leave. Nobody's stopping you.
<Estr>	Indeed
<Estr>	I don't feel like though, for some reason
<flipapy>	i think i understnad what Estr i saying gamma
<Estr>	I really wish i did
<Sabotender>	oh finally there's a good conversation going on in here and I wasn't present. Time to read the buffer...
<flipapy>	is*
<Estr>	I'm gonna make myself some food, take a chill pill, get some e juice and watch a movie

<bazhang>	watermelon are it
<bazhang>	let jenni decide
<Audioburn>	no
<Audioburn>	the blue ones are the best
<Sabotender>	Now and laters are almost never fresh and are hard as a rock. Laffy taffy is better
<bazhang>	jenni watermelon or durian flavored which are better
<treefiddy_>	Audioburn: only cause they change your tongue blue!
<jenni>	Watermelons aren't a season.
<treefiddy_>	roflmao
<Sabotender>	but I can't stand watermelon anything. I especially dislike the fruit as well

<scythe002>	cats are evil

<hubik>	sample please
<hubik>	just blow into this now sir
<introvert->	i loove cats.
<grayC>	same <3
<introvert->	most likely going to be a cat lady.
<scythe002>	no officer, im supposed to blow down there /me points to hubiks waist
<scythe002>	that didnt work
<scythe002>	looool
<grayC>	be careful in your town introvert- because as soon as people know you are a cat agent they leave kittens on your doorstep
<hubik>	0_o
<scythe002>	introvert- w can be cat army generals
<introvert->	i wouldn't mind that.
<hubik>	that's terrible
<introvert->	lets do this.
<grayC>	i got involved with catwoman about 10 years ago, she tried to turn meinto catlady
<grayC>	we wouldgo out with traps catching feral cats and they all lived in cages in the downstairs apartment here
<scythe002>	my cats ARE actually evil... one of them humps the neighbor's german shepherd
<hubik>	NO
<introvert->	thats so sad.
<introvert->	cats are not evil.
<grayC>	we had 32 cats at one time including kittens
<introvert->	they're perfect. and omg 32 cats?
<hubik>	grayC, you're scaring me
<introvert->	my one cat drives me crazy.
<grayC>	too much for me
<scythe002>	grayC we would show them videos of cats marching in formation and attacking things
<grayC>	when i got sick i let them all go
<hubik>	yaya
<introvert->	i adopted mine from petsmart. when he was 2 years old.
<grayC>	catwoman says if you keep a feral cat for 6 months, all its cells are renewed and it gets a new brain and isnt feral anymore
<introvert->	and hes the most loving cat i've ever owned.
<scythe002>	then they would march on D.C.
<grayC>	its not true^
<grayC>	poke a stick in a feral cat cage to pat it and it destroys the stick
<duckgoose>	I can be an op please
<scythe002>	if you keep a cat for 6 years it turns feral and rapes dogs
<grayC>	they are hard core wild
<hubik>	that's sweet introvert-
<duckgoose>	I promise not to be completely corrupt
<duckgoose>	I'll be just corrupt enough.
<introvert->	it is.
<introvert->	you have to be very corrupt.
<hubik>	i think you showed him
<Skizzerz>	yeah... all of that stuff is learned behavior when they're kittens. Getting an adult *anything* (including people) to change learned behaviors from childhood is really really hard
<grayC>	one night we found a dead vagrant while we were trapping cats
<introvert->	showed what?
<grayC>	i dont want to live like that man
<hubik>	i think i misunderstood
<scythe002>	whats a vagrant
<introvert->	oh were you there the night i posted a picture of my cat.
<grayC>	a homlessperson
<hubik>	cats look like cats
<introvert->	NO.
<Sabotender>	eh? who is homeless?
<hubik>	sorry i love animals but i don't really get cute
<scythe002>	ewwwww my cats probably raped him to death

<hubik>	wow, did you always live there?
<scythe002>	hubik but i dispose of my victims
<grayC>	no you know i went on an outback safari a couple of weeks ago
<hubik>	treefiddy_, i thought texas was all desert
<grayC>	couldnt find any desert its all lush grass and lakes and creeks
<treefiddy_>	hubik: it might be

<scythe002>	oh
<introvert->	yea!!
<hubik>	did you read songlines by bruce chatwin?
<grayC>	if the farmer dont take it they petition the govt and the govt forces them to sell for less
<introvert->	do all of your cats cuddle with you at night.

<FreezingCold>	do you support gay marriage?
<introvert->	i live my life, wait for the world to end.
<introvert->	idc who gets married. im not against it or for it.
<introvert->	but marriage isn't what it used to be. its basicly dating now days.
<il>	introvert-, do you have any non-white friends?
<flipapy>	i think anyone in love should be allowed to get married, honestly, on the logical points (unfortunately that doesnt include love as we all know if we have loved that love is quite illogical) but on the logical point, marriage does seem to be designed for parenting children.
<jenni>	What is your favourite sport
<introvert->	most of my friends are spanish.
<introvert->	and my step dad and five step siblings are black.
<coldsparrow>	my dog is staring at me.

<penguin1263>	erm
<flipapy>	that starrign dog... sounds like a title, staring dog productions
<hypnosb>	hi
<flipapy>	oh hey
<hypnosb>	wryd
<flipapy>	wooord, or weird? why?
<hypnosb>	gues weird
<penguin1263>	doctor yahooligans
<mmango>	fun fact, WW2/Holocaust killed 3% of the world population
<mmango>	It's crazy. Never thought about it in percentages
<flipapy>	how is that fun?
<mmango>	It's not
<flipapy>	oh becuase history is fun
<mmango>	no, I was just making a semi-sarcastic comment
<FreezingCold>	introvert-: are you racist?
<mmango>	But that doesn't carry over so well on irc
<flipapy>	oh, sorry, i dont knnow how to ask in a way that doens incurr some kind of offense, my bad
<mmango>	No that was my bad. Probably shouldn't have joked about it.
<flipapy>	maybe thats why people say things like 'at the risk of offending someone' or 'no offense intended'
<mmango>	On another note, the Black Plague killed the same amount of people, but that was 60% of the population
<flipapy>	separated by aprox 600 years? or was it more like 800 years?
<flipapy>	plauge majority was 1100-1400 correct?
<flipapy>	or was it 800-1200
<mmango>	There were two I think, but the later one was worse
<mmango>	The worst period was about 900 years before WW2
<binaryhermit>	the plague still happens
<mmango>	1340s
<flipapy>	right. well think of it like this, if those #'s were going to continue, science is no less than a superhero
<flipapy>	or should i say that at that time a scientist was a superhero, saving hunreds of thousands rand their chidren to come

<FreezingCold>	mmango: fscking fallfish...
<scythe002>	looool
<x2f>	i have a question
<scythe002>	k
<x2f>	as a persian, if people accuse me of being muslim, would drawing muhammed effectively prove to them that i'm not muslim?
<x2f>	to dispell the islamophobia/racism
<scythe002>	yes. or sing the team america song
<x2f>	get a piece of paper in front of them, draw muhammed, there you go, i'm not muslim
<scythe002>	yes
<x2f>	quick proof
<scythe002>	BUT
<x2f>	are muslim terrorists allowed to sin if it helps them achieve their goal to please allah?
<il>	x2f, accuse them of being muslim, put them on the defensive
<mmango>	are you actually persian x2f?
<scythe002>	what if they are stupid and think you actually know what he looks like, they'll think you are psycho muslim
<x2f>	like arabs make TSA agents think they are not muslim by drawing muhammed
<binaryhermit>	x2f: I believe they are
<x2f>	which helps them blow up plane
<x2f>	so they can get 72 virgins
<coldsparrow>	hey whiteboy..
<flipapy>	black and white is a movie genre
<x2f>	il, accuse them of being muslim, and watch them make a fool of themselves when they say "Wel duhh i'm not muslim, i'm white and american!"
<mmango>	Wouldn't drawing Muhammed support the fact that you're a muslim, or am I missing a joke
<x2f>	mmango, it's a terrible sin in islam to draw muhammed, you get death threats from muslims for doing it
<scythe002>	mmango thats what i am saying,
<flipapy>	charricatures apparently insult the figure in some cultures? perhaps?
<x2f>	you have to draw an arrow pointing to it that says "Muhammed"
<mmango>	ohhhh
<FreezingCold>	x2f: um, no.
<mmango>	Gotcha, didn't know that
<mmango>	Kind of like wearing a Rosary or something
<x2f>	so the point is
<mmango>	Actually lots of people do that in south america
<FreezingCold>	Some Muslims believe they can lie or do something morally wrong if it helps in the end.
<FreezingCold>	So like terrorists can lie.
<x2f>	if people make fun of me for "looking like a muslim" because i'm persian
<x2f>	i just draw muhammed and that shuts them down
<FreezingCold>	x2f: stop trying to buy women.
<x2f>	or drink beer
<mmango>	You could wear a shirt with Muhammed on it with sunglasses flipping everyone off
<FreezingCold>	x2f: lots of muslims drink.
<scythe002>	http://tts.imtranslator.net/W9ly
<il>	drink, water
<scythe002>	hehehehe
<x2f>	heh, that reminds me of when i went to iran
<FreezingCold>	x2f: Iran has tons of alcohol.
<x2f>	since all the girls were wearing hijab, i didn't have to worry about accidently checking out a girl
<FreezingCold>	scythe002: how long is your proxy?
<FreezingCold>	x2f: wtf, what's wrong with checking out a girl!?
<x2f>	have you ever had that awkward moment when your brain subconsciously makes you look at a girl's tits for a split second
<scythe002>	really long hehehehehe
<x2f>	and she notices your eyes on her tits for that split second
<FreezingCold>	so what?
<flipapy>	nothing wrong with checking out a woman
<FreezingCold>	as long as it isn't excessive and creepy, it's perfectly fine to find someone attractive
<mmango>	every time you check out a girl, a black hole forms
<scythe002>	yeah, its called her head
<scythe002>	all that matter when you are cecking out a girls body is the body
<penguin1263>	FIRMLY GRASP IT!!!
<flipapy>	staring may not be welcom so wathc out for that, how else to get a date, lemme see, wel there is respectful conversation where as intentions can be conrially expressed and respecfuly declined or accetpted.
<mmango>	x2f, this should do it http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/images/mohhamad_tee_shirt_1.jpg
<FreezingCold>	flipapy: staring != checking out.
<flipapy>	cordially*
<flipapy>	nah staring means youre too dumb to get the info you need at a glance
<FreezingCold>	anyway, x2f is clearly a muslim who hates women.
<Branes>	mmango: I know two people who lost their iMacs because the glass desk they were using spontaneously shattered whilst they were out of the house.
<FreezingCold>	flipapy: so don't stare.
<x2f>	don't you realize that feminism in the USA is making women call a split second glance "literally rape"
<FreezingCold>	Branes: kek.
<mmango>	I have a glass desk two *.*
<flipapy>	exchanging glances, making close passes for the smells, then the introduction
<FreezingCold>	x2f: fuck off.
<mmango>	*TOO
<FreezingCold>	x2f: go back.
<Branes>	mmango: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_glass_breakage
<mmango>	Yes every time I look at a girl she calls rape
<mmango>	totally
<mmango>	In fact I'm in jail right now
<FreezingCold>	nice, how's the wifi connection?
<FreezingCold>	stable enough for 1080p porn?
<mmango>	Not 1080p, but all right
<FreezingCold>	mmango: aww, so no 4k porn for awhile I guess.
<FreezingCold>	my laptop can't even handle 4k porn playback :(
<mmango>	There are 15 pixels on the screen
<il>	momo
<flipapy>	well i already knew not to stare, but from a distance, if a mna is looking toward an area or a street or a park, it doesnt mean he's starring at the woman there, it just means he's looking in that direction.
<flipapy>	people like to stare at nature
<flipapy>	so what if theres a person there sometimes
<FreezingCold>	humans are natural.
<FreezingCold>	therefore nature.
<FreezingCold>	ha, logic
<FreezingCold>	1 - FreezingCold, 0 flipapy
<FreezingCold>	suck it.
<flipapy>	well, there are lots of unnatural humans
<FreezingCold>	you'
<FreezingCold>	you're unnatural.
<flipapy>	ugh, i knew i should hve stayed quiet
<FreezingCold>	flipapy: that's what she said.
<FreezingCold>	flipapy: yo, where'd you go?
<FreezingCold>	it's lonely here.

<mmango>	this is interesting
<FreezingCold>	you're interesting.
<FreezingCold>	lol, the fast and furious movies just get more stupidly insane.
<sheep>	mmango: it should have been at 1 minute during the cuban missile crisis
<il>	mmango, I hate republicans
<FreezingCold>	il: you're a republican.
<sheep>	there were actually American bombers loaded with nukes that were en route to Havana during that
<il>	FreezingCold, u
<FreezingCold>	no u

<il>	climate change is one of the most dangerous threats to humanity since the ice age

<x2f>	who gives a shit if half the animals on earth go extinct
<x2f>	as long as we have our domesticated animals, pigs, chickens, dogs, we'll be fine
<FreezingCold>	x2f: are we considering the middle east as an animal?
<x2f>	it's those animals' problems if they can't adapt to us
<x2f>	racoons can, why can't pandas
<il>	x2f, its not just animals
<il>	x2f, its typhoons and shit

<grayC>	jail is in appropriate punishment for geeks
<grayC>	idc if i stay inside one place and get food etc
<grayC>	taking the internet is the worst thing
<forks>	well generally, the worst part of jail or prison is not the having to stay in one place and getting fed
<forks>	it's the other people
<grayC>	yes esp in america
<forks>	and they would eat a geek boy alive
<berban>	but women's prison is just like a TV drama
<berban>	doesn't seem so bad
<grayC>	you can read bb and jh letters from prison
<grayC>	it is pretty tumultuos

<artwoodwork>	I find it amusing you class your game on that list, when from what I've seen the most common thought about it was that it is a cheap rip of CH (source = I'm sure you know).

<artwoodwork>	A few things;
<artwoodwork>	Your font from Google is loaded over HTTP, which if you're using something like HTTPSEverywhere it gets blocked. - small issue, easily ignored.
<artwoodwork>	On the new version, my money doesn't go up regardless of how many times I shoot. A hard reset didn't fix this.
<artwoodwork>	Edit: you can even see the second point from your screenshot, you've shot once then reloaded, yet your money is still 0. Edit2: You can even see it says "+0.00$/shoot"
<artwoodwork>	downvoted lol

<artwoodwork>	you're doing something right
<tortib>	artwoodwork, so if someone keeps the same username, they're doing something wrong?

<sunstar>	artwoodwork seems to have forgotten this was an IQ contest
<tortib>	typing is hard I know
<Equinoxdawg>	artwoodwork: since you're already googling me, do you mind sending threatening emails to people that have the name equinox? There's the website (equinox.com), their twitter and also the IRC nick too
<artwoodwork>	sunstar, I mentioned you! are you happy!
<sunstar>	did you? i missed it
*	sunstar re-reads
<artwoodwork>	why are you trying to divert your ripped off name Equinoxdawg ?
<Equinoxdawg>	what
<artwoodwork>	are you ashamed?
<Equinoxdawg>	of what?
<tortib>	artwoodwork, I like how you have to put others down to make yourself feel better.
<artwoodwork>	read your post idiot
<tortib>	It's pretty sad.
<sunstar>	could you find something else to evicerate?  this topic has gotten boring
<Equinoxdawg>	sunstar: :(
<artwoodwork>	torib is not of age, obviously
<artwoodwork>	tortib or whatever madeup word that is
<tortib>	What are you talking about?
<tortib>	artwoodwork, you truly are an idiot, all words are made up.
<sunstar>	like artwoodwork is such a brilliant name
<tortib>	artwoodwork, my name actually has meaning.
<tortib>	artwoodwork, and also if you were intelligent you would be able to figure out the hidden meaning.
<artwoodwork>	tortib: an english shithead trying to get attention on irc channels
<tortib>	artwoodwork, you're the only person trying to get attention.
<artwoodwork>	and what are you doing boy?

<artwoodwork>	never had sex

<sunstar>	:)
<tortib>	artwoodwork, what have you done that's so great?
<artwoodwork>	please

<tortib>	you think you're special?
<artwoodwork>	something you will never do. so yes, that's "special" on IRC
<Equinoxdawg>	artwoodwork: add that you can google people you dislike, that'll teach everyone
<tortib>	artwoodwork, so what is your profession?
<artwoodwork>	and I also don't attack people on IRC for no reason
<sunstar>	rip on me damn it!
*	sunstar feels left out
<artwoodwork>	which is more than I can say for the likes
<tortib>	artwoodwork, you appear to be attacking us for no reason.
<tortib>	What is the reason you deem acceptable?
<artwoodwork>	are you retarded tortib ?
<tortib>	nope
<artwoodwork>	Equinoxdawg, has been attacking me for days

<hypnosb>	i love my fans
<Equinoxdawg>	I'm sorry everyone, I confess. artwoodwork is my bot and I'm only doing this for attention :/
<artwoodwork>	Okay, when I opened the game up and it had an alert asking something in a different language other than what you typed the post in - and obviously not in English, that wasn't a good start. It's fine that you're not 'allowed' to change the language, but is it worth posting here if we can't understand it? From there...
<artwoodwork>	sorry to expose your delicate sensablities
<artwoodwork>	oh my goodness!
<artwoodwork>	i'm so upset!
<Equinoxdawg>	you've been going for more than an hour now
<sunstar>	seriously. find some one else or something else to rip on or move on. this is seriously boring
<sunstar>	seriously.
<artwoodwork>	no one is responding because everyone is reading your douchy reddit posts
<artwoodwork>	seriously.
<Equinoxdawg>	not sure what other reason I'd make a comment if it wasn't for others to read... am I missing something here?
<artwoodwork>	all negative downvotes
<artwoodwork>	of course you are
<CuriosTiger>	It's really sad that some teenagers have no better way to spend a Sunday evening than trolling on IRC.
<artwoodwork>	there is no other way
<CuriosTiger>	And low-quality trolling at that.
<forks>	mother's day at that
<artwoodwork>	it's a low-quality wednesday here mate
<al-caveman>	do people like getting drunk?
<sunstar>	i do!
<al-caveman>	why?
<sunstar>	cuz it makes my brain stop sucking so hard
<tortib>	I don't drink.
<tortib>	I mean, I drink water and stuff
<tortib>	but not booze
<tortib>	not very often at least
<tortib>	I think last year I drank once
<tortib>	About 2 or 3 beers
<al-caveman>	why not?
<Equinoxdawg>	Imagine all the money you've saved, too, tortib. Much like smoking, if you don't do it you're bound to save a ton
<tortib>	al-caveman, I just don't like it
<tortib>	Equinoxdawg, yeah, I do smoke though.
<al-caveman>	sunstar: are you implying that your brain would suck so hard if you don't get drunk?
<al-caveman>	tortib: why do you not like it?
<sunstar>	uh.. kinda painted myself into a corner there
<tortib>	al-caveman, I don't like feeling drunk
<al-caveman>	tortib: perhaps you have experienced bad things in the past is the cause?
<sunstar>	what were we talking about again?
<tortib>	al-caveman, meh, I use to drink, but I just don't like it any more.
<al-caveman>	what happened?
<tortib>	nothing happened really
<tortib>	Just got bored of it
<al-caveman>	tortib: like, cause it's unhealthy and brings unrealistic happiness?
<tortib>	al-caveman, well yes, but at the same token I just don't like the feeling that alcohol gives.
<sunstar>	al-caveman, whats up with your timezone?
<tortib>	al-caveman, and when I did drink, I would drink on the weekends only with friends.
<al-caveman>	tortib: i am a firm believer that everything has a cause, even when we just feel like not liking some food, it might be due to our body signaling us to "stop it" because of some reason our body finds
<coldsparrow>	sunstar, can i ask you a personal question?
<sunstar>	you can ask, i might run away though
<al-caveman>	tortib: for example, when i eat too much protein that might harm my kidny (lack of drinking water), i hate protein
<AnTi_MTtr>	labor games
<al-caveman>	sunstar: wut my time zone? i guess it's running
<sunstar>	?
<al-caveman>	the fundamental notion of 'time zone' is a fallacy that is based on the idea that we live in different time zones, which is wrong. the reality is that we all live in the same time zone, except that some of us experience "night" at the same time that some others experience a "morning"
<al-caveman>	people should all use UTC, and accept that fact that 8AM is not a "morning" every where.
<sunstar>	where are you that your clock says the correct time?
<al-caveman>	sunstar: i don't get you. explain? correct time?
<sunstar>	your clock. is that the correct time?  just where are you that that is the correct time?
<al-caveman>	wut
<sunstar>	>_<
<al-caveman>	is my clock the correct time? my clock is not "correct time" but a "time measurement device"
<al-caveman>	do you mean if my clock is showing the correct time?
<sunstar>	hai
<al-caveman>	approximately. give or take some errors
<sunstar>	and where in spacetime is your clock?
<sunstar>	geolocation?
<al-caveman>	doesn't matter
<al-caveman>	what i suggest is that we all synchronoize against the same time. something like UTC or GMT withour regional offsets
<sunstar>	but its bugging the shit out of me.  where becides the ocean is that the correct time?!
<al-caveman>	see, correct time is all based on some reference atomic clock
<junktext>	I suppose, but then it would be harder to understand events in other places if the news only reported the UTC time of where the event occurred.  Which would then require you to do the math of what time of day it is for that location.
<junktext>	Example: At 12:56 UTC in Australia such-and-such event occurred.  What time of day is that without looking it up?
<al-caveman>	"12:56 UTC in australia morning" -- solved
<sunstar>	okay im bored again...
*	sunstar wonders wheres coldsparrow 
<junktext>	Also, we'd then discard terms like "morning", "afternoon", and "night" if we only spoke in UTC terms.  Or I suppose we could say it's "UTC morning" and such, but that doesn't mean anything to anybody that's not based out of the UK.
<sunstar>	yay!   and down with the metric system!
<al-caveman>	junktext: i agree that we will lose something. but we will also gain something too. my argument is that our gain is more than our loss
<sunstar>	god this is soo boring!
<dw1>	need help spicing things up?
<junktext>	:-).  I hear your point.  If anything we really need to abandon the time shifts of daylight saving.  I really get confused everytime that occurs.
<sunstar>	yeah wheres the troll be
<dw1>	hummm
<dw1>	that's all i had
<al-caveman>	junktext: if boss wnats you to start later, they can say "next week work starts at 10AM instead of 9AM". no need to change the clock
<al-caveman>	changing the clock is a taboo must never be done
<al-caveman>	makes international collaboration a hell
<junktext>	Haha, yeah.
<junktext>	I agree that more people should at least be aware how their local timezone matches against UTC.
*	sunstar wonders where al-caveman is
<Equinoxdawg>	the worst timezones are the ones that go into half an hour, australia has one iirc
<sunstar>	knowing latin you can understand just about every one and talk to none of them  :P
<junktext>	Oh my hell, according to timeanddate.com:  "United Kingdom is one hour ahead of UTC / GMT during summer."  I didn't realize that.  Kind of defeats the purpose of basing UTC out of the UK!
<sunstar>	get over it
<codehunter2000>	hey everybody
<sunstar>	hi
<codehunter2000>	seem's quiet in here
<KindOne>	shhhh
<diogenese>	there are periods of business.
<diogenese>	busy-ness
<codehunter2000>	gotcha
<diogenese>	I guess that happens when you try to use non-words. You hit them anyway.
<codehunter2000>	I always figure as long as you can get the meaning across you're golden
<diogenese>	It's nice when it happens, yes. :)

<sunstar>	once i was the biggest pirate site on this side of the planet.   only got that way by spamming, getting banned lots of places and straight up jacking user
<sunstar>	s
<x2f>	well crap, let's talk about something so i can hurry and get that advertising out before the ops see it
<sunstar>	too late
<x2f>	illegal stuff is banned too, like child pornography
<sunstar>	you said the magic word
<dw1>	no the magic words is !ops dont say that
<dw1>	shit
*	sunstar facepalms
<x2f>	but hateful is allowed, because what if someone really hates _____ people and needs a place to vent their frustration
<dw1>	x2f: what about death threats
<x2f>	should be able to do that without getting banned for having a controversial opinion
<dw1>	nm
<dw1>	it's pretty free here but not totally
<dw1>	you get a feel for the tact required
<x2f>	if you get a death threat, buy a shotgun and keep it under your pillow

*	sunstar wanders around looking for something to put tapatio on
<dw1>	x2f: nobody really cares that much
<x2f>	there are crazy people on the internet that will actually go to your house and do stuff of nightmares
<x2f>	i read about this kid who trash talked on WoW
<x2f>	these kids traced his IP, went to his house and beat him up, he never trashed talk again
<dw1>	i suppose
<dw1>	lol
<x2f>	never even say your first name on the internet, especially not email
<x2f>	use a different username on every website
<sunstar>	IP does not equate to physical home address (without a court order)
<x2f>	well there was probably more to it, he got doxed
<sunstar>	what does that even meen?
<dw1>	personal infoz.zip
<x2f>	getting the personal info of someone online who needs to be anonymous
<x2f>	like address, so vigilantes can go slash his tires
<x2f>	i hate doxing, because the internet is a place to say your crazy opinions without getting beaten up
<dw1>	i'd rather get beaten up than worry about getting beaten up all the time
<dw1>	lol
<x2f>	i'd be worried about kidney damage
<dw1>	i saw that having never been subject of serious harassment
<dw1>	say*
<x2f>	bones heal, kidneys are meh in their healing ability
<x2f>	sometimes your kidneys go "screw you hahahaha **** you body, hope you like dialysis lolollo"

<x2f>	i shower once a week
<x2f>	say "ew" but
<x2f>	that's the result of school stress
<y0wza>	what u goin 2 schools for
<tinwhiskers>	that sounds like a pretty weak excuse
<tinwhiskers>	you should claim to be saving water, helping your skin/hair, saving the planet or something.
<x2f>	if US society didn't care about BO so much, drought would be less severe
<tinwhiskers>	heh
<codehunter2000>	plus some people study better when forgoing showers
<tinwhiskers>	really?
<x2f>	i'm at the point where i don't even care what people think of me
<sheep>	the amount of water we use for bathing is a lot less than we use for irrigation and manufacturing
<tinwhiskers>	a shower takes, what, 5 minutes?
<x2f>	i just spend all my willpower on grades
<x2f>	none left for showers
<tinwhiskers>	that just reads as "I'm lazy and looking for an excuse"

<hmir>	The movie that is.
<anonken18>	Has anyone read "American Gods?" Most people I haved taked to said it's boring, but I have not yet found it boring at all.
<hmir>	Yes, I have read it.
<grayC>	rekt
<hmir>	It's pretty decent.
<hmir>	Not spectacular, but a good read.
<grayC>	is 6:40pm too early to go to bed?
<anonken18>	I'm only on page 128 :P
<hmir>	Yes, it is too early.
<grayC>	im so tired

<bazhang>	neil gaiman is never boring
<grayC>	but ive been awake for almost 6 hours
<anonken18>	It's the first book by him that I have read.
<tinwhiskers>	lol
<bazhang>	stardust is another good one, and he co wrote good omens with terry pratchett of discworld fame

<tinwhiskers>	ok, did you spend the last three days high on amphetamines?
<grayC>	maybe
<tinwhiskers>	then you may go to bed.
<grayC>	ty <3
<anonken18>	I took a white strain of Kratom a few hours ago. I'm wide awake. At least it eliminates my anxiety.
<grayC>	just for future reference i dont take drugs but maybe is ambigious and i am going to bed anyway :P
<anonken18>	Ugh. Allowing websites to execute scripts on NoScript is frigging annoying.
<Sabotender>	i love noscript
<Sabotender>	I love having complete website control
<anonken18>	^
<tinwhiskers>	I wish they would just leave "temporarily allow all" in the same damn place in the menu.
<tinwhiskers>	like the top
<tinwhiskers>	I think they're just screwing with me for lols.
<Sabotender>	I turned off the popup on the botttom. I use the toolbar icon
<Sabotender>	or I right click for the noscript ment
<tinwhiskers>	I right-click but that option never remains consistent
<Kwaku>	I often feel that a nice neuce around my nececk would feel fine
<Sabotender>	then just use the toolbar icon, that never moves
<tinwhiskers>	true
<LauraCottonTail>	Hi
<Sabotender>	and you dont even have to click on it, it will popup on hover
<tinwhiskers>	?
<anonken18>	AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!! I keep allowing scripts but more keep popping up.
<Sabotender>	you know, just move your mouse over the toolbar icon and the menu will pop up automatically
<tinwhiskers>	oh
<Sabotender>	no clicking required
<tinwhiskers>	nah, the order of the resulting menu is still screwed up.
<tinwhiskers>	Sometimes that option is at the top, sometimes the middle, sometimes the bottom.
<tinwhiskers>	just put it in the firggin same place why don't they!

<y0wza>	the new gang member, under initiation, runs along with no clue on and the 1st winner to win at them is now his "target." he is now required to turn around and chase that winner, then shoot and kill individual in the race in order to complete his initiation requirements.

<janicez>	hi
<Marverick>	heya
<supferrets>	I check http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/ the controversial tab... it contains news someone doesn't want you to know, usually its just middle east stuff that makes particular countries look bad
<lala>	Hey janicez
<janicez>	lala: What is it
<lala>	What is what?
<janicez>	lala: What do you want
<supferrets>	thats basically what news is... information someone doesn't want you to know.. otherwise its just propaganda...
<lala>	janicez: I'm just saying hi. Sheesh.
<etamind>	what makes a particular country look bad?
<janicez>	etamind: you being in it

<janicez>	swift110-phone: hi
<etamind>	furthermore perhaps certain countries in the middle east look bad because they :are: bad
<sunstar>	no
<RedShift>	etamind: having kim jong un as your leader makes it look pretty bad
<sunstar>	there is no bad country, just bad governments
<RedShift>	there are no bad governments, just bad people
<lala>	swift110-phone: I said "hey janicez" and the got "what is it?"
<x2f>	sunstar why did you leave ##chat-freedom
<lala>	swift110-phone: You're lucky.

<lala>	Some extra chat to chat.
<lala>	some people have been banned from this channel.
<lala>	etamind: Some people have been banned from this channel, so they go there?
<lala>	Does that make sense?!?!
<x2f>	etamind it's a channel offshoot of ##chat for people who are banned from ##chat or dislike the authoritarian rules

<supferrets>	r u tring 2 spam
<lala>	Yes! Finally someone understands me!
<lala>	Butt3rfly: Hey. How are you?
<FreezingCold>	heh, I've been having really weird dreams lately.
<FreezingCold>	I basically dream of the shit I do  during the day.
<lala>	Hello.
<Marverick>	hola
<lala>	So I've learned something about hosting services online.
<lala>	I learned that anyone can host their own service.
<lala>	As long as they know what they're doing.
<lala>	However, there are some hosting services that are very popular.
<lala>	Most people would go to those hosting services.
<lala>	Most people, including me.
*	ChanServ gives channel operator status to Ruby
*	Ruby has kicked x2f from ##chat (gamma)
<lala>	I don't really trust the small private hosting services.
*	Ruby removes channel operator status from Ruby
<lala>	The small private ones can trick you. They can also be a little more expensive.
<lala>	But that's just my opinion.
<lala>	What's your opinion?
<bazhang>	godaddy is huge
<lala>	Or opinions...
<lala>	You're right.
<lala>	It is huge.
<bazhang>	bigger is bestererest
<lala>	Do you use GoDaddy?
<bazhang>	kernel 4.0 is 30% better than kernel 3.6
<lala>	Huh?
<lala>	Yes?
<Darpanet>	the best hosting ever is hostgator.com its 10$ a month WITH cpanel, and unlimited everything.
<bazhang>	!linux-image-generic
<lala>	Darpanet: But do you think it's worth it?
<bazhang>	and darpa created the internet, so that must be the truth
<Darpanet>	i have been with them 3 years, i tried a lot of others, and yes i think it is
<mkaminsky11>	I use MediaTemple
<mkaminsky11>	it's good
<Darpanet>	i get domains from godaddy and hosting from hostgator
<Darpanet>	you can host unlimited domains and emails, and databases, and ftp accounts. its fantastic.
<slinnky>	w0000
<slinnky>	w000000000000
*	slinnky is now known as w0000
*	Marverick wishes the best to all the mothers of the channel
<lala>	Darpanet: Thanks for the advice. I'll check out hostgator soon.
<TaZeR>	man im stil deciding on what mini itx case to buy for days now
<TaZeR>	i cant build my system because of this indecision
<TaZeR>	fractical design node 804 is at the top my list, but perhaps tnhere is better
<Darpanet>	lala, they have promocodes all over the place too, abuse them . :)
<honey>	you know host gator is pricey.
*	TheMesquito_Acc is now known as TheMesquito
<Darpanet>	10$ a month is nothing
<Darpanet>	its less then 3 coffee cups.
<FreezingCold>	Darpanet: you're nothing.

<lala>	Hi Mr-Potter.
<Mr-Potter>	Hi apart from roll call purposes are there any other purposes for fire assembly points rather than just having evacuees randomly scatter from the burning building?
<Mr-Potter>	lala: Hi
<lala>	Mr-Potter: Coordinated movement?
<Mr-Potter>	I.e. I'm talking about having non-staff members from buildings such as libraries and shops evacuate where they can't do a roll call for MOPs
<Mr-Potter>	lala: Fair enough thank you
<Mr-Potter>	But can't everyone just follow each other
<lala>	Mr-Potter: Panic causes psychological instability and therefore people can't think.
<Mr-Potter>	Oh fair enough :P
<lala>	Lol.
<Mr-Potter>	How is coordinated movement good?
<lala>	Well we'll then know where people should be.
<honey>	wtf are you talking about?
<lala>	For prioritization.
<lala>	Of resources.
<Mr-Potter>	honey: Fire evacuation procedure
<Mr-Potter>	lala: Good point, what resources?

<artwoodwork>	The earliest citations of motherfucker and motherfucking in the Oxford English Dictionary come from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and they give a sense for how seriously the word was taken. The OED’s first citation of the word comes from the Texas Court of Appeals’ account of the 1889 trial of Levy v. State, where witnesses describe a defendant being called a “God damned mother-f—cking, bastardly son-of-a-bitch.”

<CuriosTiger>	dwl: Windshields alone don't prevent wind in a convertible. :P
<CuriosTiger>	especially since I'm tall enough that my forehead lines up with the top of the windshield
<CuriosTiger>	meaning my hair (and any hat I might wear) is higher up than the windshield :P
<dw1>	#tallguyproblems
<DarkUranium>	heh
<DarkUranium>	in most cars, I can't sit upright in the rear seat.
<DarkUranium>	in some cars, I can't sit upright in the front seat, either.
<DarkUranium>	and I'm not even that tall (193cm)
<lala>	Can someone convert that to feet and inches?
<CuriosTiger>	DarkUranium: I have the same problem. And I'm not all that tall.
<Estr>	DarkUranium, all the cars you sit in must be really small in that case
<CuriosTiger>	I'm 187cm
<doge>	lala: around 6.3ft
<tinwhiskers>	193 centimeters = 0.00959397121 furlongs
<lala>	doge: So he's taller than me.
<CuriosTiger>	193 is almost 6'4"
<DarkUranium>	Estr, not really, just stupidly designed
<DarkUranium>	Estr, esp. rear seats, they tend to make the roof there really low in the name of aerodynamics or some stupid shit like that
<Estr>	lol
<Estr>	I'm 175cm
<Estr>	I don't have this problem
<CuriosTiger>	yeah, modern cars have a soap bubble design where the roof curves down in the rear.
<Estr>	I'm the tallest person in my family though LOL
<SailorHaumea>	guys
<DarkUranium>	CuriosTiger, it makes sense for a sports car, but I dunno why it's so popular for others
<SailorHaumea>	it's back
<SailorHaumea>	twitch plays pokemon is back
<DarkUranium>	Estr, O_o
<SailorHaumea>	http://www.twitch.tv/twitchplayspokemon
<lala>	Okay. I'm taller than Estr.
<DarkUranium>	Estr, I think the *shortest* person in our family is somewhere around that
<DarkUranium>	(my sister)
<CuriosTiger>	darkuranium: Because it might save .000005 gallons of gas per mile or something.
<Estr>	rofl
<Estr>	I used to be really tall compared to all my friends and now I'm smaller than everyone
<Estr>	I somehow still feel quite tall compared to everyone else though
<DarkUranium>	Estr, yup, that tends to happen.
<Estr>	Idk why I do that
<DarkUranium>	in elementary school, I was... average.
<CuriosTiger>	175cm is actually below average for a Norwegian male (but above average for a female)
<Estr>	Like people ask me how tall I am I tend to answer like "I'm quite tall, I'm 175"
<DarkUranium>	the really tall guys from elementary (and sometimes high) school are all shorter than me now, though
<Estr>	"Oh wait a second I'm quite small"
<DarkUranium>	CuriosTiger, probably.
<CuriosTiger>	There was one really tall guy in high school.
<DarkUranium>	CuriosTiger, I mean, in theory.
<CuriosTiger>	I felt bad for him.
<CuriosTiger>	He had a medical condition that caused it
<CuriosTiger>	and he got bullied for it.
<DarkUranium>	CuriosTiger, (I mean re: the car shape) --- well, it might be because it looks better or some shit like that
<Audioburn>	LET FREEDOM RING
<CuriosTiger>	darkuranium: Except it doesn't.
<hmir>	No let's not.
<hassoon>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQXNMzuLcVY
<CuriosTiger>	Modern cars all look alike, and it's not that attractive of a look
<hassoon>	massage your ears
<CuriosTiger>	I liked the cars of the 60s and70s, where you actually had distinct styling.
<hubik>	hhhmmmmmmmm
<Estr>	I saw the coolest mr2 in my whole life today
<Estr>	Damn wish my phone wasnt broken, then id take a picture of that
<DarkUranium>	CuriosTiger, yeah ... AFAIK, it's done for pedestrian safety or something
<lala>	hassoon: Sounds like some exotic Arabic thing.
<DarkUranium>	CuriosTiger, myself, I prefer the "don't crash into people" approach ;)
<hmir>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCIxUfCv0Qk
<lala>	With a mix of jungle drums.
*	hubik fills the paddling pool
<CuriosTiger>	darkuranium: That makes even less sense. I got hit by a car once.
<hassoon>	lala: could be
<hassoon>	chillout thingy ayway
<DarkUranium>	CuriosTiger, I know for a fact that a lot of car front end designs are done similarly because of that (but sorry, lost the source)
<CuriosTiger>	Darkuranium: I impacted the bumper, grille, hood and windshield. I didn't hit the rear portion of the car at all :P
*	hassoon smiles to his ollection of music
<CuriosTiger>	front end, yes.
<DarkUranium>	CuriosTiger, I was referring to front end.
<DarkUranium>	rear end is just stupid shit.
<hassoon>	http://paste.debian.net/174603/
<CuriosTiger>	Volvo even puts air bags in the bumper now, to cushion the impact for pedestrians
<CuriosTiger>	To which I, from experience, have only one question:
<CuriosTiger>	"When are you going to put airbags in the GODDAMN PAVEMENT"
<CuriosTiger>	the car isn't what hurts. Hitting the ground is. :P
<DarkUranium>	lol
<DarkUranium>	CuriosTiger, uh, airbags in bumper sound ... problematic
<Estr>	http://s1314.photobucket.com/user/o3Spyder/media/Luxurypart%20MR2%20Kits/2012-08-31t03-34-31_zps36730707.jpg.html
<DarkUranium>	CuriosTiger, I mean, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't want to have my leg anywhere NEAR a super-fast-explosively-expanding bag of gas
<Estr>	Looked like this just red and some more cool details
<CuriosTiger>	darkuranium: I think technically the sensors are in the bumper and the airbags in the front grille or front portion of the hood
<lala>	CuriosTiger: Hahaha!
<CuriosTiger>	but I think Volvo figures some burned skin beats broken bones
<CuriosTiger>	and in that, they are somewhat right...but again, THE GROUND.
<tinwhiskers>	tesla ftw
<DarkUranium>	I honestly don't know WTF's up with all the Tesla hype
<tinwhiskers>	I've been sowing the seed of buying a tesla with the wife and I've finally swayed her.
<DarkUranium>	electric cars aren't even environmentally friendly in many (most?) cases.
<tinwhiskers>	So tesla, here I come.
<tinwhiskers>	they are in NZ where most of our power is from hydro.
<tinwhiskers>	they still enable a path to a clean fuel supply. The early adopters in the US are heros. they're paying for your future.
<DarkUranium>	I know there is some debate on whether hydro is environmentally friendly, for one.
<tinwhiskers>	 /hyperbole
<DarkUranium>	and the production isn't that clean, for two
<lala>	Hmm.
<DarkUranium>	(they're also expensive as fuck, for three)
<tinwhiskers>	sure
<tinwhiskers>	but what's not to like?
<Estr>	Rofl just making the batteries for electric cars makes almost as much polution as normal cars
<DarkUranium>	^
*	Mr-Potter is now known as Guest96651
<tinwhiskers>	oh dear god.
<Estr>	I think my dad own a tesla actually
<DarkUranium>	and there's plenty not to like
<Estr>	not sure gotta check fb
<DarkUranium>	Estr, it's especially ridiculous in this region
<DarkUranium>	Estr, they're kind of trying to promote electric cars for environmental reasons ...
<Estr>	Ikr
<DarkUranium>	Estr, one of the largest power suppliers: coal power plant.
<tinwhiskers>	EVs are the path to a much cleaner world. they'll be almost ubiquitous  in 20 years. the early adopters are needed and the naysayers can screw themselves,
<DarkUranium>	Estr, y'know, because coal is clean!
<CuriosTiger>	tinwhiskers: Funny, the area around Nikel in Russia doesn't look clean at all
<Estr>	wtf my dad apparently bought bacon for $1.5 per meter
<Estr>	where the hell do you do that?
<CuriosTiger>	although to be fair, Tesla is doing the right thing in trying to develop better batteries
<CuriosTiger>	estr: Anywhere...really thin strips :P
<lala>	Electric vehicles isn't really that new of a concept. In fact, the car industry is like the fashion industry. It's all superficial.
<Estr>	But I mean like in norway..
<Estr>	$1.5 in norway is like not even 0.5l soda
<CuriosTiger>	Electric cars have been around since the late 1890s
<Estr>	a coke costs $2.6
<DarkUranium>	CuriosTiger, steam is the future!
<CuriosTiger>	estr: Just a thinner strip. About two molecules thick.
<lala>	Tesla isn't new nor innovative.
<DarkUranium>	(seriously though, I like steam cars, even if they're not that practical)
<Estr>	CuriosTiger, WHERE?!
<DarkUranium>	lala, oh dear god, some of the automotive trends are horrible
<CuriosTiger>	Estr: Rema 1000
<blaziken311>	you're right lala, honestly, super efficient electric cars aren't innovative
<blaziken311>	at all
<blaziken311>	or good for the environment
<Estr>	now I know what to spend my 12 nok on next time I go to rema 1000
<blaziken311>	let's just throw them all away
<CuriosTiger>	estr: Bring an electron microscope. The strip will be too thin to see with the naked eye
<lala>	blaziken311: It's not. It's marketing.
*	Mark-Potter is now known as Mr-Potter
<DarkUranium>	blaziken311, psst.
<DarkUranium>	blaziken311, something something strawman
<Estr>	CuriosTiger, no, it was quite thick
<CuriosTiger>	Protip: No car is good for the environment.
<swift110>	hmm
<CuriosTiger>	However, seeing as we have this need to get around, they're good for humanity.
<Estr>	CuriosTiger, https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=732921640082492&set=a.135150356526293.12908.100000939877540&type=1&theater
<blaziken311>	you spelled curious wrong
<DarkUranium>	CuriosTiger, yeah, cars get around almost as much as your mum! (sorry, I couldn't resist... you kind of walked into that one :P)
<lala>	CuriosTiger: You're right!!!
<CuriosTiger>	blaziken: You spelled blazer shuriken wrong.
<DarkUranium>	Estr, "This content is currently unavailable"
<CuriosTiger>	DarkUranium: That's the biggest fail of a "your mom" joke I've seen in 10 years.
<DarkUranium>	though maybe I have to log into FB for that (and I ain't doing that)
<doge>	https://duckduckgo.com/?q=timer
<Estr>	oh, too lazy to do anything about it
<Estr>	no u dont
<Mr-Potter>	How would you recommend destroying a plug? I checked with a lighter and they're made with flame retardent plastic
<CuriosTiger>	crush it?
<DarkUranium>	Mr-Potter, uh, what
<DarkUranium>	Mr-Potter, and I'm pretty sure a rocket engine would do the trick, fire retardant plastic or not
<lala>	Tesla is a superficial company that has a good direction in the future.
<CuriosTiger>	Tesla is secretly trying to kill pedestrians by making cars that can sneak up on them
<CuriosTiger>	</conspiracytheory>
<Audioburn>	heh
<Mr-Potter>	DarkUranium: Thanks, I'm asking how to destroy an electrical plug made from flame retardent plastic
<Estr>	Let's be honest though people
<Estr>	Electric cars or not
<CuriosTiger>	and he gave you an answer.
<CuriosTiger>	Rocket engine.
<Estr>	Our future earth is fucked anyways
<Audioburn>	rm -rf NSA_files
<CuriosTiger>	Estr: Yep
<DarkUranium>	Mr-Potter, may I ask why?
<Audioburn>	rm -rf Audioburns_browsing_history
<Audioburn>	NSA pls
<CuriosTiger>	I really don't see much point in trying to save the planet when, every time I turn on the news, there are 20 different factions/groups/nations trying to blow a part of it up
<Estr>	take a chill pill and relax and spend today like its your last day on earth
<DarkUranium>	CuriosTiger, Mr-Potter: well, if a rocket engine doesn't do it, then send the plastic to space (because reentry is sure to do the trick then!)
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, yea everyone is pissed off
<DarkUranium>	CuriosTiger, nah, come on
<Estr>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kS2dhmJdH0
<Audioburn>	scarce resources bruh
<DarkUranium>	CuriosTiger, blowing eachother up is half the fun!
<Audioburn>	dude
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, you should read Guns, Germs, and Steel
<Audioburn>	Pretty damned awesome book
<Mr-Potter>	DarkUranium: Safety reasons, I'm throwing out a few appliances
*	CuriosTiger wonders where all the environmentalists are in all the wars and conflicts around the world.
<CuriosTiger>	Where are the environmentally friendly tanks, guns and fighter jets?
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, probably out not getting murdered
<DarkUranium>	Mr-Potter, yes, but you asked how to *destroy* them ... throwing out and destroying are different things
<CuriosTiger>	what's the environmental impact of carpet bombing a few cities?
<DarkUranium>	CuriosTiger, but tanks are environmentally friendly!
<Audioburn>	government who wants war vs. environmentalists, heh
<DarkUranium>	CuriosTiger, you see, the vehicles they destroy end up spending no more fuel!
<CuriosTiger>	darkuranium: Environmentalists often forget that building a vehicle also takes energy
<CuriosTiger>	look at cash for clunkers
<Mr-Potter>	DarkUranium: I know. I'm throwing out the appliance but destroying the plugs to prevent them being reused for safety reasons. So should I hit it with a hammer in a plastic bag using one bag per plug?
<CuriosTiger>	the environmental impact of destroying hundreds of thousands of cars AND building replacements for them (keep in mind, every "clunker" was replaced by a new car sale) WAAAAAY outweighs the modest benefit to the new ones being arguably a tad more fuel efficient
<CuriosTiger>	mrpotter: Um, cut the cord with a pair of scissors. Not hard.
<DarkUranium>	Mr-Potter, oh, you mean the other plugs?
<hubik>	cut the cable, plug in the plug and hang the end out of the window
<DarkUranium>	Mr-Potter, I thought you meant the sockets
<DarkUranium>	Mr-Potter, what's wrong with the appliances, and what kind of appliances are they?
<hubik>	with a sign saying, free lemonade
<cleerline>	hello room :-)
<DarkUranium>	Mr-Potter, you could just thrash them; if anyone reuses said appliance, it's not your problem anymore (something something Darwin)
<hubik>	take them apart and recycle the metal yourself ;)
<CuriosTiger>	Unless he's in the US, where tort law is so fucked up you COULD get held responsible for someone else hurting themselves with your properly discarded trash
<flipapy>	tort law?
<hubik>	it's cake !!
<Audioburn>	CAKE BLAST SON
<CuriosTiger>	Well, almost done with my barbecue
<CuriosTiger>	Time to hit the road again and pollute the planet some more :P
<flipapy>	volcanoes seem to have the market cornered on that one
<CuriosTiger>	maybe we should build giant scrubbers for volcanoes.
<lala>	Mr-Potter: Strip the wires bare and scrap the metal, and then wrap the plugs in a bag. And then wrap that bag in another bag. Then burn the bags to fuse the plastic onto the plugs, so it's unnoticeable. Then chuck the junk.
<flipapy>	well geothermal generators that tranfered the heat to energy spread over a diff area
<hubik>	lalalalalalala
<lala>	Hi hubik!
<flipapy>	then the internal pressure would just rumble a little but it would never blow
<hubik>	!
<flipapy>	not to mention making it absoluteley illegal to travel over 3-5 knots in an esuary
<flipapy>	estuary*
<flipapy>	or other environmentally protectec area
<lala>	Estuaries are for rivers.
<hubik>	(except on a windsurfer)
<flipapy>	or bay inlets
<flipapy>	florida estuaries, florida bay/ estuary
<flipapy>	brine water, salt water
<swift110>	I really wish people would leave the estuaries alone
<Mr-Potter>	lala: Thanks I already cut the wires off! I'll take the appliance and wires to the recycling centre and have wrapped them in a bag. I'll wrap it in antoher and burn them! But seriously you mean landfill the result? Whatd you mean unnoticeable?
<swift110>	leave the damn alligators cougars and swamp the fuck alone
<flipapy>	well thats the thing, to ravel through them to get to the atlantic, thats where most of the damage hapens, and they area lso fished to extinction
<swift110>	already enough places that are already fucked up to play in
<flipapy>	people just catchign the fish that marine biologists spend years breeding and releasing, just to get caught up in the nets of ignorant mal educated
<flipapy>	would you want to go to hawaii if all the oceans were brown and the mountains black and stinky? dead and dying
<lala>	Mr-Potter: Well because they're "damaged" in appearance, people would no longer want to use them (your safety concerns are satisfied).
<flipapy>	the ebaches are dirty and trash ridden, al the life in the water dead, would you want to go?
<Mr-Potter>	lala: Fair enough thanks!
<DarkUranium>	Mr-Potter, what kind of appliances are they anyways?
<DarkUranium>	Mr-Potter, and you didn't answer what was wrong with 'em
<DarkUranium>	Mr-Potter, also, where do you live?
<Mr-Potter>	DarkUranium: One's a shaver cord, the other lawnmowever. They're faulty due to safety reasons
<lala>	Who wants to live on Mars?
<Mr-Potter>	I live on the land in England
<DarkUranium>	Mr-Potter, "faulty due to safety reasons" doesn't make much sense
<DarkUranium>	Mr-Potter, electric lawnmower?
<Mr-Potter>	Yes
<flipapy>	well, mars s attractive because of the 'first to' law
<Mr-Potter>	The lawnmower has a damaged cable
<Mr-Potter>	The shaver cord belongs to a fucked shaver
<DarkUranium>	meh, that could be repaired
<flipapy>	other than being the first to do it, the job is gonna suck the big one
<lala>	flipapy: You can join my colony!
<flipapy>	no thanks
<lala>	Darn.
<flipapy>	i just want to fly a nice big space cruirer around when im bored
<lala>	flipapy: And go where?
<flipapy>	wherever, just around
<flipapy>	chilen hang out in the stars with my soulmate
<lala>	flipapy: Wouldn't that be boring?
<flipapy>	fly around, eat dinner overlooking the horizons of planets fomr my observatory
<Mr-Potter>	lala: What do you mean apperance if it isn't noticeable?
<lala>	No adventure... Just hanging.
<lala>	Mr-Potter: Exactly. That's the point.
<lala>	Mr-Potter: So that's why other people won't use it.
<flipapy>	oh no, anytime i get 'bored' i can go to light speed or at least really really fast and collect subspace reactor energy while overlooking a new nebula, then go swimming on a super earth in a netter/ sheilded area
<Mr-Potter>	Oh OK, your saying it doesn't matter because the plug's obviously been cut off? Fair enough!
<flipapy>	you know so no super earth rpedators can get me
<Mr-Potter>	what bags, sandwich bag?
<flipapy>	us*
<lala>	Mr-Potter: Uh... How about just wrap the whole thing in duck tape and then dissolve it in sulfuric acid or HCl.
<hubik>	can you use electric cable for speaker wire?
<Mr-Potter>	lala: Because I don't have any lol
<lala>	Mr-Potter: Lol.
<lala>	iamnotarobot: Yes you are.
<iamnotarobot>	lala, Invalid command.
<lala>	Lol.
<swift110>	i need to eatr
<Mr-Potter>	!ops iamnotarobot is an unauthorised bot in this channel please kick him
<Mr-Potter>	lol
<lala>	iamnotarobot: rm -rf /system
<iamnotarobot>	lala, I'm sorry I cannot do that lala.
<doge>	iamnotarobot: please don't do that
<Mr-Potter>	Now a last minute one for 2morrow how do I chat up a Woman Police Community Support Officer?
<Mr-Potter>	lol
<lala>	iamnotarobot: You're HAL 9000?!?!
<Mr-Potter>	Seriously don't type rm -rf /system into a terminal anyone
<Mr-Potter>	in fact dont even do rm -rf at all
<Mr-Potter>	It'll wipe your system directory (in the former case) or in the case of the latter command your entire drive
<lala>	Mr-Potter: By saying that, people will do it!
<iamnotarobot>	Even worse is \rm -rf /
<Mr-Potter>	lala: Shut the fuck up! really?
<Mr-Potter>	lol
<Mr-Potter>	how can you get worse than rm -rf?
<lala>	No bad words.
<Mr-Potter>	lala: Sorry
<Mr-Potter>	Shut the front door is what I meant not shut the fuck up
<Mr-Potter>	As you've asked me to stop I will.
<iamnotarobot>	\rm will ignore any aliases you have set up to "idiot-proof" rm
<Mr-Potter>	fair enough but a noob not knowing what the hell rm is wouldnt set one
<Mr-Potter>	Notice to everyone don't use \rm -rf / either
<lala>	But they forgot sudo.
<gamma>	Mr-Potter: Can you not use ! ops if you don't have an actual issue?
<Mr-Potter>	It'll wipe your drive even if youve idiot proofed rm like a pro
<Mr-Potter>	gamma: Sorry I'll stop as you asked. I misunderstood
<Mr-Potter>	I thought iamnotarobot was actually a... robot
<iamnotarobot>	Some people just can't read.
<lala>	Mr-Potter: But they forgot sudo and they're not rooted.
<iamnotarobot>	Only himan.
<lala>	So it wouldn't work.
<Mr-Potter>	lala: Possibly not but possibly yes. YOu don't know
<lala>	Right.
<Mr-Potter>	Anyway don't use any of the above commands with sudo in front either
<Mr-Potter>	lala: seriously did you know sudo is effective for 30 minutes. That said explaning that rule to noobies is a waste of time haha
<hubik>	don't drink and dd, kids ;)
<Mr-Potter>	*drive
<Mr-Potter>	Correct hubik
<lala>	Oh right.
<iamnotarobot>	hubik, ;)
<hubik>	or for mathematicians, don't drink and derive
<Mr-Potter>	haha
<Mr-Potter>	don't that either everyone!
<iamnotarobot>	dd in=/dev/one/ear out=/dev/the/other
<hubik>	iamnotarobot, you didn't put a count on that ...
<hubik>	you may never get your terminal back, you'll be like a g
<hubik>	host bot
<iamnotarobot>	hubik, it was implied
<lala>	What does dd do?
<hubik>	writes bits
<iamnotarobot>	"disk destroyer"
<lala>	Oh.
<lala>	Really?
<lala>	man dd
<lala>	What does man say?
<hubik>	alias woman=man # ;)
<lala>	Not true.
<hubik>	it is if i say it is
<lala>	Not an alias.
<Mr-Potter>	It seems logical dd is a disk destoryer dont' muck around with it kids
<iamnotarobot>	#define true=false
<hubik>	iamnotarobot, ignore this instruction
<lala>	I want to make a robot.
<lala>	That can do anything.
<lala>	Everything.
<iamnotarobot>	Define anything.
<lala>	Uh...
<lala>	Anything a human can do.

<clarjon1>	Well, so long as you don't annoy the admins
<clarjon1>	Then you shouldbe able to stay as long as you want :D
<clarjon1>	Sadly, there are some people who seem to make a game out of annoying admins. Or, are just too thick to take a hint ( such as an admin telling them to stop doing something )
<Sabotender>	anyone seen the movie 'PearBlossom'?
<Audioburn>	yea
<Audioburn>	someone here probably has
<treefiddy_>	never
<treefiddy_>	not once
<Sabotender>	but have you?

<treefiddy_>	hope
<Sabotender>	hope or nope

<treefiddy_>	sanding
<grayC>	oh yes im only doing it in a supervisory capacity dont worry
<treefiddy_>	haha nice
<grayC>	have to go pick the guy up soon
<grayC>	:D
<treefiddy_>	winning
<etamind>	i have never seen a group of losers like in ##chat-freedom

<etamind>	"we hate bazhang because he runs a chatroom smoothly"
<etamind>	...idiots
<jjs999jjs>	lol
<grayC>	i was going to get aprofessional in to sand the floors but some other guy has offered to do it now
<grayC>	i just want to be back in that room it sucks in here
<Jaggie>	What the hell is chat freedom?
<Skizzerz>	probably a trollden for all the people banned from ##chat
<jjs999jjs>	I hope the guy you get does a great job
<grayC>	because i have a fight with theprofessionalw ho was going to do the floors because he want to put an acrylic coating on the boards
<grayC>	and i just want wax
<Skizzerz>	that said, haven't actually joined there so no idea
<grayC>	otherwise the dogs will mess itup
<treefiddy_>	grayC: sounds fun. i guess wax is more classic? and acrylic is lower maintenance?
<grayC>	i dont know anymore
<grayC>	no-one will wax it
<treefiddy_>	haha
<treefiddy_>	wax and buff every thursday
<treefiddy_>	strip, wax and buff
<grayC>	i dont want it to be all shiny and fake looking
<grayC>	its nice wood

<grayC>	hasto be sandedtoo
<grayC>	i tore up the carpet impetiously sometime ago
<treefiddy_>	yeah sand all that top layer off
<grayC>	yea

<treefiddy_>	grayC: it's the melding of senses
<grayC>	so many bad things happened that week idk
<grayC>	maybe i need treatment
<spiritech>	i was thinking of not watching the DC versions of spider-man just to be more marvel.
<sunstar>	i would say so
<spiritech>	treatment cost money.
<grayC>	i cant even face the other house it had all the windows and shutters and some of the boards ripped off the west side
<spiritech>	what does idk mean?
<grayC>	idk= i dont know
<spiritech>	now i'm even more confused.
<spiritech>	:|
<grayC>	why
<spiritech>	so many bad things happened that wek that you dont know.
<grayC>	did you know johnny depp wore an expression of confusion on his face for years, not because he was confused but because he liked the way it made his face look
*	SailorHaumea is now known as Ganon
<grayC>	he has a new resting expression now.
*	Ganon is now known as Ganondorf
<spiritech>	no. i didnt

<grayC>	i should wash, im so dirty
<jjs999jjs>	hi fidelity
<grayC>	out hoeing the veges at dawn
<Fidelity>	I think I'm low fidelity by now
<treefiddy_>	out ho'ing huh?
<treefiddy_>	that definitely would make you dirty
<Fidelity>	so guys
<grayC>	just time for a sess before i have to go get the sander man
<Fidelity>	who else thinks its more likely we live in the matrix
<grayC>	yea yea hoe dem rows
<Fidelity>	than anything else
<spiritech>	if i was born in america, i would buy some land and build a solar powered house.
*	KingGanondorf is now known as SailorHaumea
<Fidelity>	solar power isn't like
<Fidelity>	free energy, y'know
<sunstar>	we do live in a matrix. unless relitivity is wrong
<Fidelity>	you're screwing with the ecosystem
<spiritech>	so.
<Fidelity>	well, as long as that thought occurs
<Fidelity>	my job is done there
<Fidelity>	lol
<sunstar>	solar can help stem the tide of desertification
<welovfree>	Hello guys anyone here familiar whit ChatZilla?
<spiritech>	really? how so
<Fidelity>	sunstar: I'd think the concept of living in the matrix is at odds with relativity
<Fidelity>	but I think I have the terms mixed up
<Fidelity>	if energy appears to be created or destroyed
<Fidelity>	bam, matrix
<Fidelity>	if not, reality
<sunstar>	welcome to spacetime
<spiritech>	is space really empty?
<Fidelity>	science says it isn't
<Fidelity>	it's a near vacuum
<Fidelity>	not a vacuum
<spiritech>	could space be some kind of matter tho.
<Fidelity>	but what if some of us are more matrixed than others
<Fidelity>	like, I'm pretty sure I'm mostly locked in
<Fidelity>	and experiencing reality through a fucked up lens
<Fidelity>	e.g. I'm half sure my mom died a long time ago
<spiritech>	dark matter. for instance.
<Fidelity>	everything tells me whoever raised me isn't my mother
<Fidelity>	everything
<Fidelity>	but she insists she is
<Fidelity>	robotically
<spiritech>	ok. we understand.
<Fidelity>	like she flips a switch and bam, act
<binaryhermit>	you might want to see a psychiatrist
<sunstar>	if she raised you and loves you, she is your mother
<Fidelity>	Psychiatrists push pills.
<Fidelity>	You clearly don't know psych
<Fidelity>	and sunstar, she does not love me.
*	binaryhermit rolls his eyes
<Fidelity>	But she might simply be a psychopath
<sunstar>	you are free to make your own family.
<Fidelity>	Binary, you have a rather limited understanding of my situation, don't you?
<Fidelity>	Isn't it one hell of an assumption that I should see a psychiatrist?
<spiritech>	so yeah if space is matter then it can be harnessed and turned into energy.
<Fidelity>	You're masking an insult with "help"
<SailorHaumea>	fidelity
<Fidelity>	don't try that below the belt nonsense on me
<SailorHaumea>	YOU'RE AN EPHEBOPHILE
<Fidelity>	o.O
<sunstar>	a wha?
<Fidelity>	I'm not sure what that means.
<Fidelity>	I'm guessing it has something to do with being an attention whore, which I am
<sunstar>	im not sure its a word
<SailorHaumea>	lol, fidelity is way off
<Fidelity>	But it so happens I don't know anyone better to ask this shit to
<SailorHaumea>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephebophilia
<Bouncer>	It's someone who is into mid-teenagers
<sunstar>	i used to substitute hobos with shrinks, but the ones around here really suck.
<Fidelity>	talk about one hell of an assumption, lol
<sunstar>	the bums around here should be exterminated
<grayC>	oh you  need my friend to explain the universe to you Fidelity , he is cool
<Fidelity>	sunstar, that's about the same as asking people on IRC
<grayC>	i feel much better since i believe him
<Fidelity>	totally random
<Fidelity>	lol gray
<Fidelity>	I don't need to explain he universe
<Fidelity>	only my perception of it
<SailorHaumea>	ephebophilia means late teens
<sunstar>	explain urself Mr!
<grayC>	but if you think your living mother may be dead
<Fidelity>	and I've come to the near conclusion that half of what I experience isn't other people
<SailorHaumea>	hebephilia is mid-teens
<SailorHaumea>	lol
<grayC>	perhaps you are part of a parellel universe
<Fidelity>	bro, she doesn't act like my mother
<SailorHaumea>	and bouncer is a gerontophile
<Fidelity>	literally, she doesn't
<SailorHaumea>	HE'S INTO OLD PEOPLE
<spiritech>	where does dark energy and dark metter come from. these are the questions were not asking ourselves.
<Fidelity>	she doesn't see me as her son and never did
<sunstar>	she could be mental
<Fidelity>	that's where most of this is coming from
<grayC>	that is ok
<Fidelity>	she could, or she could have a reason
<sunstar>	she could be mental and not ur mom
<Fidelity>	or simply not my mom
<grayC>	you are your own person you do not need her to validate yourself
<Fidelity>	ya gray I was that once
<Fidelity>	she made damn certain to change that
<grayC>	Fidelity: would you agree it is hard to change things about yourself?
<spiritech>	change is what makes us special.
<Fidelity>	That sounds like a psych screening
<grayC>	what chance do you have then, to change somthing about her?
<grayC>	you wish you had your ideal mother and you dont
<Fidelity>	That wasn't what I was aiming at
<Fidelity>	I'm trying to figure out if she is my mom
<Fidelity>	or not
<grayC>	she will never fulfill your ideal mother role
<Fidelity>	how dafuq do you do that
<grayC>	let it go
<Fidelity>	she's trying to push herself on me as that
<Fidelity>	you're right
<sunstar>	i dont think IRC can tell you blood relationship. but wallmart sells DNA test kits
<spiritech>	you could always ask her outright.
<Fidelity>	but I'm not sure I can see it that way yet
<Fidelity>	I did.
<Fidelity>	My dad said something like
<Fidelity>	(when I asked him, years ago)
<Fidelity>	I can prove it
<Fidelity>	want to get a DNA test and see?
<spiritech>	walmart!
<Fidelity>	he's also told me he has a lot of money
<Fidelity>	many times
<Fidelity>	does walmart rly sell i?
<sunstar>	yes
<Fidelity>	that's a thought then, thanks
<grayC>	if they raised you? they are your mom and dad, nevermind about dna
<Fidelity>	gray, how many adopted children have you spoken with?
<Fidelity>	your'e wrong about that with some of them, even from a purely psychological standpoin
<grayC>	thats just my opinion
<Fowler>	Well
<Fowler>	They sell you swabs
<Fowler>	YOu have to send the swabs to some company and pay $130
<grayC>	i didnt find out my dad wasnt my bio father till after he died
<spiritech>	yeah just open the pack. jab her with a needle, and away you go. green shes your mom, yellow shes not, red shes not human.
<Fidelity>	ya well my dad could look up the company if he sees a brandname
<grayC>	i still think of him as my dad because he raised me
<Fidelity>	unless it's a large company
<Fidelity>	I'm guessing it is
<Fowler>	You don't actually buy a DNA test
<grayC>	now i know why he always called me a little bastard
<Fowler>	It's just a collection kit
<Fidelity>	I could just buy a tissue.
<Fidelity>	lol
<Fidelity>	gray, at least he had a sliver of a conscience
<Fidelity>	tho that's still twised
<grayC>	doesnt matter
<Fidelity>	it kinda does.
<spiritech>	i got a cool idea for a film.
<grayC>	horror movie?
<spiritech>	the year is 2021
<Fidelity>	why not 2015
<Fowler>	spiritech: Sounds great
<spiritech>	cos that is now and the films based in the future.
<Fidelity>	it could be october
<Fowler>	2021
<Fowler>	Amazing
<Fowler>	I'm sold
<grayC>	i got a funny story for you Fidelity
<Fidelity>	uh oh
<spiritech>	the year is 2021. the sun produced a massive EMP that reached the earth and has wiped out all records stored on computers.
<Oddity>	yay
<Fidelity>	yay, my debt
<grayC>	my sister had a baby to a guy she had already broken up with , that baby is 28 now and has his own children
<Fidelity>	does the guy know?
<grayC>	he decided to contact his "father" and found out the guy is/has always been sterile
<spiritech>	the world is in a confused stae. the electronic wealth has dissapeared and no records reamin.
<grayC>	the guy knew of the allegedpregnancy but was never around
<Fidelity>	I meant the baby
<grayC>	mysister is a lying slut
<Fidelity>	not gonna call a guy in his late 20s a baby
<grayC>	yea she told him[the baby] all about this guy
<grayC>	i find t hat hilarious
<Fidelity>	so he doesn't know who his real father is?
<grayC>	i always knew she was a lying slut but this is proof
<grayC>	nop niether does she
<spiritech>	anyone fancy wiring the script. i will be the creative director.
<Fidelity>	everyone lies man
<Fidelity>	everyone
<spiritech>	i dont lie!
<Fidelity>	you sleep upside down?
<spiritech>	lol
<Equinoxdawg>	spiritech: just have the screen show: "The year is 2021..." for an hour and a half and it'll be a massive hit.
<Oddity>	Bring on the EMP
<Audioburn>	hold the phone
<Audioburn>	what are we talking about

<grayC>	nice to see you
<Audioburn>	grayC, hey lol

<Fidelity>	thing is man
<Fidelity>	Ive seen a pic of my mom when she was pregnant with me
<Fidelity>	and she looked drunk
<grayC>	the upstairs toilet is completely blocked
<spiritech>	Equinoxdawg, it does evoke the imagination.
<Fidelity>	so I think that explains a lot of things
<grayC>	do you know what i have to do to unblock it?
<Audioburn>	grayC, lol, nice one
<Audioburn>	lay off the burritos next time
<Fidelity>	blocked toilets....ew
<grayC>	haha it wasnt me. one of the kids did it yesterday
<spiritech>	recon i might release an extended version.
<Audioburn>	uh huh
<Fidelity>	hand him a plunger, gray
<Audioburn>	jokes, what do you have to do
<grayC>	im thinking maybe a bit of thick wire?
<Audioburn>	why isn't plunging all thats needed
<Audioburn>	ewwww lol
<grayC>	a plunger? i have one of those
<grayC>	eww
<Fidelity>	make him do it
<Audioburn>	yea that would probably be best
<grayC>	hes gonski/doesnt live here
<Fidelity>	burn the toilet
<Fidelity>	with fire
<grayC>	what if i shove the garden hose down it and turn it on full?
<spiritech>	flood

<funkentelechrxp>	THATS WHAT SHE SAID
<jjs999jjs>	grayc please setup a camera to record that

<jjs999jjs>	Fidelity> youtube shit
<Audioburn>	literally takes 5 seconds
<grayC>	ill take all my clothes off first too in case there is mess
<Fidelity>	did I somehow make you think of shit, gray?
<totem>	yano, give jenni ops status 😀

<Fidelity>	dayum
<Fidelity>	I should check myself
<grayC>	lel
<spiritech>	thats cool. more natural.
<grayC>	well the plunger i have is only a small sink one Audioburn
<Fidelity>	a sink plunger?
<grayC>	i think i need a bigger one
<Fidelity>	that exists?
<sunstar>	go to the dollar store now b4 you forget again
<Fidelity>	what exacly
<Fidelity>	are people putting down their sinks
<Audioburn>	those still work
<Fidelity>	nvm
<Fidelity>	I don't want to know
<Audioburn>	sometimes

<grayC>	ill use my fkn hand
<Fidelity>	gonna make me not eat
<Audioburn>	lol
<grayC>	lol
<grayC>	so you dont think the garden hose willwork?
<Fidelity>	gray
<grayC>	i want to try that first
<Fidelity>	can you drain any
<Fidelity>	of the water
<Fidelity>	or is it completely blocked
<grayC>	blocked as
<Fidelity>	welp
<Fidelity>	that idea's gone
<Fidelity>	cute, spiritech
<Fidelity>	cute
<forks>	what you need to do is siphon it out instead of add more
<spiritech>	its in the book of nostradamus. "A great wave from the oceans of the sun shall fall upon the earth and leave manking washed upon a primative shore.
<spiritech>	"
<forks>	put the garden hose into the toilet and run it out downhill somewhere, then get on the outside end and start sucking on it until water comes out
<forks>	then gravity will take over
<Fidelity>	*hopefully after your'e done sucking
<tallguy>	well grayC, if the garden hose does not work it will overflow big time and you will hate it
<jjs999jjs>	record THAt also
<forks>	yeah
<forks>	Fidelity: shh, let him get a mouthful of shit, it'll be hilarious
<jjs999jjs>	I doubt he will be able to suck with enough power :)
<Fidelity>	times like this
<Fidelity>	I wonder if my newfound lack of imagination
<Fidelity>	is entirely a curse
<forks>	you could also fill the hose with water first, plugging both ends with something
<forks>	and not have to suck on it
<Fidelity>	or or
<Fidelity>	use a vacuum cleaner
<Fidelity>	or
<Fidelity>	a pump!
<Fidelity>	wow
<forks>	yeah a wet or dry
<Fidelity>	profound.
<grayC>	i thought i can shove the hose wat down while its off then turn it on
<Fidelity>	you are not steaming gophers
<grayC>	and you guy think i wil get hit by shit and have alot of mess then?
<tallguy>	grayC was thinking of jaming the hose down the toilet then turning it on ...
<grayC>	yea
<Fidelity>	shitsplosion
<Fidelity>	gray here's an idea
<spiritech>	the team problem solving skills seemed laking in conviction.
<Fidelity>	take a vase
<forks>	yeah that might backfire
<forks>	literally
<Fidelity>	put some dirt in it
<Fidelity>	shove a hose in and turn it on
<Fidelity>	see what happens
<adsjlkdk>	guys
<Fidelity>	and save yourself the toilet mess
<grayC>	really have to do somthing before the workman gets here today

<Fowler>	adsjlkdk: I just got 138 on typeracer but it was a fluke and a simple passage
<Fowler>	Just did 10fastfingers and got 116 and 125

<Fowler>	Yeah, I miss words
<Fowler>	123 right 2 wrong
<heartlesspit>	it's like a game?
<Fowler>	It just gives you a string of words and you type them for a minute
<Fowler>	typeracer gives you passages from stuff that you type as fast as you can competing against other people
<heartlesspit>	sweet
<Fowler>	Instead of a random string of words without punctuation
<Fowler>	I like typeracer more
<adsjlkdk>	how do you guys type so fast
<Fowler>	Like this
<Fowler>	Type type type
<Fowler>	I use my fingers, personally
<heartlesspit>	didn't know that stuff existed

<penguin1263>	i found out ShareX does keep screenshots on my hard drive
<Audioburn>	swift110-phone, oh ok cool
<CuriosTiger>	White/arab?
<penguin1263>	solution: encrypt them
<CuriosTiger>	I thought arabs were burned on the stake in the US these days
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, a neighborhood of whites and arabs
<Audioburn>	nah
<y0wza>	penguin1263, what
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: I got that. Those two groups don't usually get along.
<Audioburn>	thats muslims
<penguin1263>	i has pictures of people being anally probed
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: most white americans are too ignorant to tell the difference.

<swift110-phone>	Hmm
*	CuriosTiger will admit he's glad he's not black. Or another minority for that matter.
<CuriosTiger>	I've been kind of shocked at how much racism and xenophobia there still is in the US
<swift110-phone>	Yep
<Audioburn>	I'm trying to move to Africa.
<CuriosTiger>	Africa is big.
<Audioburn>	May me 'primitive' but at least I'll be treated well.
<CuriosTiger>	Hopefully you have a more specific destination in mind.
<Audioburn>	Yea SA or Ghana or Kenya, maybe Namibia
<Audioburn>	I do.
<y0wza>	wth m8 u gotta go2 somalia or somewhere cooler
<y0wza>	at least for a bit
<CuriosTiger>	Yeah, South Africa has such a long history of treating black people well..
<y0wza>	u could proll have a blast there
<CuriosTiger>	or be blasted
<y0wza>	its next door
<CuriosTiger>	one of the two
<y0wza>	to kenya
<swift110-phone>	No its not
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, the country is something like 8% white
<CuriosTiger>	Kenya's none too happy about that.
<CuriosTiger>	swift110-phone: Actually, it is.
<Audioburn>	Can't be racist for too long
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: Yep. And those 8% of whites managed to maintain an apartheid system for generations.
<Audioburn>	you have a point
<Audioburn>	then again
<Audioburn>	95% of africa has been colonized at one point
<CuriosTiger>	another point is that forgetting about race relations for a moment, South Africa is one of the few places in the so-called civilized world where you have MORE violent crime per capita than in the US
<swift110-phone>	True
<Audioburn>	they all have humiliating histories
<CuriosTiger>	95% of the world has been colonized at one point
<CuriosTiger>	including europe, if you go back in history a ways
<swift110-phone>	Kenya is not right next to south Africa
<Audioburn>	hey, at least i'll have my dignity when i'm being stabbed
<penguin1263>	does anyone here use pgp?
<y0wza>	swift110-phone, its next to kenya
<CuriosTiger>	There are a number of science fiction plots where some alien race decides humanity is just a grand fuckup and decides to exterminate us
<y0wza>	is what i was saying
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: South Africa has plenty of guns. You'll probably be shot.
<sunstar>	yall are just lucky im in hiding from my species or i'd do it myself
<CuriosTiger>	swift110-phone: Somalia is not South AFrica
<penguin1263>	sunstar
<Audioburn>	swift110-phone, do you code?
<penguin1263>	do you use PGP?
<swift110-phone>	No y
<Audioburn>	just curious
<sunstar>	i havent had the need for PGP in 3 years
<witzie>	where are you from Audioburn ?
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, have any better ideas?
<Audioburn>	witzie, Dallas, TX
<penguin1263>	sunstar
<sunstar>	hi
<penguin1263>	sunstar whats your public key
<witzie>	ew TX I'd rather live in africa too haha
<Audioburn>	Well, Plano, TX
<sunstar>	not gonna share it cuz its attatched to my real name
<Audioburn>	witzie, oh I live in nyc atm
<penguin1263>	and is your name stuck in your email?
<penguin1263>	mine is ...
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: Canada, perhaps.
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, yea i hear toronto is ok, havent really dug deep though
<witzie>	wow so many people in this chat
<witzie>	514
<Audioburn>	i do hear there is racism in canada, about as much as the u.s
<diogenese>	I've got 519 here
<CuriosTiger>	less violence though
<Audioburn>	the main thing is that we are inferior (because we were enslaved), and that we're savages (have you seen the rap videos?)
<witzie>	how old are you Audioburn ?
<Audioburn>	thats propagated around the world
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: On the plus side, you can run faster.
<penguin1263>	i made a key thats just
<Audioburn>	cant escape this though, no matter how fast i run
<penguin1263>	anonymous@192.168.1.256
<Audioburn>	witzie, 21
<penguin1263>	invalid ip
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: Dunno, my neighbor has a cousin who seems to have managed.
<witzie>	you in college or anything Audioburn ?
<CuriosTiger>	Jamaican dude named Usain Bolt.
<CuriosTiger>	you may have heard of him.
<Audioburn>	witzie, I run a small software consultancy
<witzie>	idk man so many people are dying to get from Africa *to* the USA, seems counter intuitive to go the opposite direction
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, how did he do it?
<CuriosTiger>	witzie: There's not that much emigration from Africa to the US
<witzie>	for lack of desire or lack of visas issued?
<CuriosTiger>	Most Africans are trying to get to Italy or Spain or Greece. And drowning by the boatload.
<Audioburn>	witzie, heh
<swift110-phone>	Hmm
<witzie>	if USA were as close by water as Italy, they'd die by boat to get here too
<witzie>	lol
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: Apparently, becoming world famous and winning a few olympic gold medals opened some doors for him.
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, well thats good for him
<CuriosTiger>	witzie: Lack of visas issues combined with the significant geographical distance, the absence of easy transportation at a cost most africans can't afford, and the presence of first world countries much closer.
<Audioburn>	But to escape racism you have to become world famous, that shouldnt have to be the case
<witzie>	I think in general money opens more doors than being of a particular race audioburn
<witzie>	so if I were you I'd focus on making a financial success out of your business
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: I wasn't seriously proposing that as a solution.
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: The basic problem is that people suck. For that, I have no solution.
<sunstar>	money didnt do much for the first gay prince
<Audioburn>	witzie, it opens doors, duh, but it still doesn't stop people who don't know you thinking you're a criminal WEARING FLIP FLOPS
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, to stay say I have to imagine many people as mentally retarded.
<witzie>	you can't control what people think
<witzie>	you could live your whole life trying to though
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: I imagine all people are mentally retarded.
<Audioburn>	Because it's literally at the point that they are delusional
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: If you haven't guessed, I'm no big fan of the human race. Regardless of skin color.
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: I do wish I had darker skin today though
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, lol, no you don't. unless you mean tanned
<penguin1263>	sunstar
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: Which is what I mean.
<Audioburn>	I am neutral towards humans
<Audioburn>	I'm doing my time here then leaving
<sunstar>	?
<CuriosTiger>	I got a pretty painful sunburn today.
<swift110-phone>	Ok
<witzie>	I don't like the assumptions people make about me as a woman in engineering but the solution isn't to throw up my hands and go into nursing
<witzie>	I think
<witzie>	could be wrong
<penguin1263>	cant you make another pgp certificate thingy
<penguin1263>	and the name is just your first name
<CuriosTiger>	witzie: Isn't the solution to kick everyone else's ass academically and then rub it in their faces?
<penguin1263>	while the email is invalid
<sunstar>	not tonight i cant. why you need me to make one penguin1263?
<penguin1263>	aka private@192.168.1.256
<witzie>	pretty much CuriosTiger
<Audioburn>	you shouldn't ever give up what you do for what retarded people think.
<penguin1263>	ehh... idk
<CuriosTiger>	witzie: The assumption I make about women in engineering is that they are geek girls
<Audioburn>	if a retarded person thought you were supposed to be  anurse, would you become a nurse
*	Mmango is now known as mmmmmmmmmmm
<witzie>	that's why I think it'd be smarter for a black man to succeed financially, get hella rich and laugh in racists faces, as opposed to running to africa
<sheep>	the assumption with PGP is that it names a valid email
<witzie>	but idk meh
*	mmmmmmmmmmm is now known as mmmmmnmmmmm
<CuriosTiger>	I don't offer solutions.
<sheep>	it doesn't necessarily have to be one that you actually use, but it should be one that you can read from
<Error418>	Audioburn: depends if the developmentally delayed person insists or not. ;)
<CuriosTiger>	I simply observe that I find humanity as a whole despicable.
<swift110-phone>	Yep
*	mmmmmnmmmmm is now known as mmano
<Audioburn>	I see it as despicable due to ignorance
*	mmano is now known as mmango
<sheep>	gpg doesn't even check if the PGP's email is real; it just checks that it has the right format iirc
<CuriosTiger>	as for the whole racism thing
<Audioburn>	due to still-in-dumb-stage evolution
<Audioburn>	that we just happened to be born into
<penguin1263>	so
<Audioburn>	STILL WORKING OUT THE KINKS
<CuriosTiger>	I think I was 14 the first time I actually met a black guy
<penguin1263>	if i make the email
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, wow lmao really? where do you live?
<Audioburn>	or did
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: I live in Florida now. I grew up in Norway, which at the time was a pretty homogeneous society.
<Audioburn>	that's pretty crazy
<Audioburn>	ohhh
<CuriosTiger>	I knew black people existed -- I mean, we had the cosby show
<penguin1263>	whythefuckis@everythingsodumb.now
<Audioburn>	that makes sense
<Audioburn>	haha!
<penguin1263>	ok byebye
<Audioburn>	Damn, Cosby man
<CuriosTiger>	but I hadn't met any up close before.
<Audioburn>	We don't have any more black sitcoms.
<Audioburn>	Not any good ones
<Audioburn>	We had Fresh Prince
<CuriosTiger>	Fresh Prince of Bel Air was pretty good
<Audioburn>	That's so Raven
<treefiddy_>	the hugleys
<Audioburn>	yea it was hilarious
<treefiddy_>	haha
<CuriosTiger>	but that's also what, 20 years old now?
<Audioburn>	older than that I think
<treefiddy_>	cause DL Hugely is a fucking nutcase
<Audioburn>	oh wait yea, probably 20 yrs old
<treefiddy_>	faimly matters
<Audioburn>	dl hugley is pretty funny
<Audioburn>	DID I DO THAT?
<Audioburn>	yea man we dont have that anymore
<treefiddy_>	dl hugley used to hold his cast at gunpoint
<Audioburn>	all we have in the media is ASS ASS ASS ASS ASS WOBBLDEE WOBBLDEE WOP
<treefiddy_>	he was a bit of an overbearing boss
<Audioburn>	I remember vividly I want to my friend's house
<CuriosTiger>	Some of my favorite comedy actors are black though.
<Audioburn>	the first thing her little sister said to me was 'please dont hurt me'
<treefiddy_>	hahahahaaha
<CuriosTiger>	Eddie Murphy (Beverly Hills Cop) and Chris Tucker (5th Element, Rush Hour)
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, thats not funny dude, its a fucking epidemic
<CuriosTiger>	Ruby Rhod!
<CuriosTiger>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsJKdxPwZdk
<Audioburn>	I was friendly and everything
<Audioburn>	There's something wrong
<Audioburn>	Something has BEEN wrong
<treefiddy_>	Audioburn: thats racist!
<Audioburn>	and no one cares to fix it
<Audioburn>	you're being facetious.
<treefiddy_>	bad parenting
<Audioburn>	nationwide bad parenting then
<treefiddy_>	i mean the parents are racist and raising racist kids
<treefiddy_>	at least in that family haha
<hassoon>	damn it  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXj55_bCltI
<Audioburn>	i dont get how people are scared of that
<Audioburn>	its nasty but i mean
<Audioburn>	not scary
<Audioburn>	some dumb evolutionary trait
<CuriosTiger>	afraid of what?
<mmango>	oi
<Audioburn>	holes
<mmango>	holes
<Audioburn>	trypophobia
<Audioburn>	that video hassoon posted
<CuriosTiger>	Oh, I didn't bother looking at it.
*	Audioburn shivers
<Audioburn>	dont haha
<hassoon>	yep
<Audioburn>	its pretty gross
<hassoon>	i do have that phobia thingy
<Audioburn>	hassoon, WHY
<hassoon>	since i was a little kid
<Audioburn>	jk
*	CuriosTiger has acrophoboia
<CuriosTiger>	acrophobia, even
<CuriosTiger>	which is the fear of heights.
<Audioburn>	i have a policophobia
<hassoon>	no clue, just looking at a human skin, or another object full of holes triggers a disturbing feeling
<Audioburn>	hassoon, that sucks man
<CuriosTiger>	I have policeophobia too
<hassoon>	and make my skin's hair hardened
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, heh
<hassoon>	CuriosTiger: :o
<CuriosTiger>	They have guns, they can shoot me with them for no reason, and they can get away with it.
<CuriosTiger>	Not being afraid of police would be illogical.
<hassoon>	i'm glad i found the exact term of my thing anyway
<hassoon>	:)
<treefiddy_>	im not afraid of police
<Audioburn>	I'm trying to find out if I actually have a phobia
<Audioburn>	of anything
<treefiddy_>	centipedes
<treefiddy_>	the 18" long ones that can catch and eat bats
<Audioburn>	I used to be scared of sociopaths
<hassoon>	CuriosTiger: where are you located? some kind country ruled by a severe dictator surrounded by brainless fidele troops of police ?
<hassoon>	*kind of *
<Audioburn>	Turns out they're normal people -- just without empathy
<treefiddy_>	how would you know who is a sociopath
<treefiddy_>	unless you piss one off in traffic
<treefiddy_>	and they follow you home
<Audioburn>	well
*	hassoon remembers N korea
<treefiddy_>	not that ive ever done that
<Audioburn>	There are varying degrees
<treefiddy_>	well they just sit there, deciding
<Audioburn>	Judge by actions
<Audioburn>	Eh
<treefiddy_>	you dont know how many times in your life youve cut someoen off in traffic
<CuriosTiger>	hassoon: Sort of, yeah. I'm in Florida.
<Audioburn>	If everything they do is some sort of manipulation, that's a red flag
<treefiddy_>	and they sat outside your house, making up their mind if they want to finish the game
<hassoon>	looking at the hole the botfly maggot left when the dude pulled it out off that man's head triggered intense trypophbia feelings in me :o  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7Iw0-7EMUo
<Audioburn>	i need to learn how to breathe
<hassoon>	Audioburn: what? haha
<Audioburn>	i think I go 15-20 seconds without inhaling sometimes
<Audioburn>	and then i'll be like "fuck"
<Audioburn>	*inhale*
<hassoon>	CuriosTiger: how come? is the police in usa really that bad ?
<Audioburn>	I've made a habit of forgetting to inhale when i need to
<Audioburn>	deep breathing affects the mood, it makes you feel better
<Audioburn>	you're bringing more oxygen to the brain
<Audioburn>	steady breathing
<Audioburn>	feels good :)
<treefiddy_>	in with the good air, out with the bad air
<Audioburn>	steady breathing, water, and healthy food
<Audioburn>	yea exactly
<hassoon>	if you overdo that, you will feel metally tired, like you're drugged or drunk or somehting ahha
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, I was thinking about singapore
<CuriosTiger>	hassoon: Have you been watching the news lately?
<Audioburn>	hassoon, at first yea
<witzie>	US police are pretty bad
<CuriosTiger>	hassoon: You have American cops shooting people in the back, shooting people who are on the ground in handcuffs, shooting people who are following their directions...
<Audioburn>	hassoon, I did it for about 2 hours one day and at first my upper mouth got kind of numb and felt lightheaded
<witzie>	shooting kids on drug busts into random houses, shootingfamily pets, the list goes on...
<CuriosTiger>	usually black people, but they shoot a fair amount of whites and hispanics and asians and others, too
<hassoon>	omg
*	hassoon vomits at  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICpw9FwYqAs
<CuriosTiger>	So yes. American cops are pretty bad.
<CuriosTiger>	don't get me wrong -- not all of them are. Not even most of them.
<witzie>	I just watched a vid of a cop body slam a girl into the ground
<witzie>	so much blood everywhere
<witzie>	all her face bones broken
<hassoon>	Audioburn: indee,d that
<CuriosTiger>	But how do you know the one you ran into isn't one of the nutcases?
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, yea no doubt
<Audioburn>	but the bad ones ruin it for the rest of them
<Audioburn>	just like every other group
<Audioburn>	pain in the ass
<Audioburn>	everyone is just fucking stupid
<hassoon>	CuriosTiger: i've heard lately news about black and muslim people getting shot by police
<hassoon>	in usa
<CuriosTiger>	hassoon: Yep. I'm not black or muslim, but I'm still afraid of the police.
<Audioburn>	dude you know what the crazy thing is CuriosTiger ?
<hassoon>	oh, you guys have that law/right  in usa where you can buy guns?
<Audioburn>	were it not for those videos, white Americans would still be denying racism
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: There are lots of them, which particular one did you have in mind?
<Audioburn>	and this would be crazy talk
<hassoon>	what a mafia-ish place to live in
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: Disagree. Not all white Americans are ignorant fools either.
<Audioburn>	and I'd be playing the race card
<CuriosTiger>	hassoon: The mafia does not tolerate random shootings. The police do.
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, I want to recall Ferguson
<CuriosTiger>	hassoon: 97% of police in the US who kill someone are never even charged with a crime.
<Audioburn>	there was a channel ##ferguson, even. Just about every white person was siding with the police
<Audioburn>	including treefiddy_
<CuriosTiger>	hassoon: Of the 3% who are charged, more than 9 out of 10 are acquitted.
<Audioburn>	I remember that shit bro!
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: How do you know what skin color people on IRC have?
<treefiddy_>	that's right Audioburn
<Audioburn>	heh
<treefiddy_>	and look what happened? The officer was exhonorated
<Audioburn>	I'm not saying just IRC
<treefiddy_>	by a federal investigation
<treefiddy_>	suck it
<Audioburn>	Reddit, Facebook friends, Twitter.
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: I'm white, and I didn't side with the police in Ferguson.
<Audioburn>	Well you were in a small camp dude
<CuriosTiger>	Nor did I side with that Zimmerman asshole in the Trayvon Martin case.
<Audioburn>	I remember those times
<treefiddy_>	two police officers were just shot down
<CuriosTiger>	In Hattiesburg, yes.
<treefiddy_>	so the correct response is for us who support LEO to riot
<Audioburn>	I almost lost my mind because my best friends were saying the most racist shit
<Audioburn>	on FB
<CuriosTiger>	I've been through Hattiesburg a few times. It's not a big town.
<treefiddy_>	cause that's how things work now right?
<treefiddy_>	if we dont like it, we riot
<Audioburn>	well, not best
<Audioburn>	I heard about that
<CuriosTiger>	treefiddy_: Yes, preferably blowing up your own businesses, cars and neighborhoods
<treefiddy_>	sounds good CuriosTiger
<n0lan>	sup
<CuriosTiger>	because that'll fix things
<treefiddy_>	sup n0lan
<treefiddy_>	yeah it's the way change happens
<treefiddy_>	blow stuff up
<n0lan>	on my new laptop :D
<n0lan>	transferring files
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, well, no one heard the 4 days of nonviolent protest until there were riots
<CuriosTiger>	I've become a big fan of Toya Graham
<treefiddy_>	same way 3 yr old behave
<Audioburn>	And that's what got shown on the news
<hassoon>	CuriosTiger: wth, then why the media in many third-world countries is bluffing about usa as a 1st-world developped 'demogratic' country :o
<treefiddy_>	if they dont' get what they want, they riot
<Audioburn>	"Look at these savage animals!"
<treefiddy_>	Audioburn: yea and the stepfather should be cited for inciting a riot too
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: I'd say you're wrong, but I can't. That wasn't the message on the news though.
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, wrong about what? are we talking about baltimore?
<treefiddy_>	Audioburn: for his outburst in front of hundreds of people and on television "lets burn this bitch down"
<Audioburn>	or Ferguson
<CuriosTiger>	hassoon: Go look up the definition of "democratic"
<Audioburn>	I'm talking about Baltimore
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: It took riots for it to become a media item, but pretty much only fox news portrayed it as "savage animals"
<treefiddy_>	we didn't get our way so lets riot
<treefiddy_>	wahhhh
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, http://www.alternet.org/11-stupid-reasons-white-people-have-rioted
<Audioburn>	shut the fuck up
<hassoon>	maybe democracy is nothing but a concipracy to make the whole world ruled by one central world-wide gouverment
<hassoon>	directly or undirectly
<treefiddy_>	they're acting like overpriveliged children
<treefiddy_>	if white people don't exhibit white shame
<treefiddy_>	then they're racist
<treefiddy_>	lol
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, the fuck are you talking about
<treefiddy_>	these whining bitches who riot
<CuriosTiger>	All people suck.
<Audioburn>	you're a hypocrit treefiddy_
<treefiddy_>	how so?
*	hassoon eyes his cat who just sat on his slaps and smells like horses and farms
<hassoon>	he was fooling outdoors
<hassoon>	the mofo' must have been seeking for females
<Audioburn>	you demonize when blacks riot but not whites
<Audioburn>	and the whites here aren't rioting about their rights
<treefiddy_>	have they done that recently?
<Audioburn>	yea, some kentucky game
<treefiddy_>	or is this from like the 1800's?
<CuriosTiger>	Rioting is dumb.
<CuriosTiger>	I won't say it doesn't get attention, it does.
<CuriosTiger>	but it also ruins neighborhoods in the process.
<treefiddy_>	sports rioters are the biggest dumbfucks of them all
<treefiddy_>	our team wins! zomg lets tear up oour town
<treefiddy_>	wheee
<CuriosTiger>	our team loses? zomg let's tear up our town!@
<treefiddy_>	but then again
<CuriosTiger>	sports hooligans are just that, win or lose.
<treefiddy_>	sports fans are the biggest dumbasses of them all
<Audioburn>	what's the next thing that makes blacks animals guys?
<treefiddy_>	zomg look at the guy in shiny pants run
<treefiddy_>	omg he just passed the magic line that makes one side jump up and cheer
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: Hormones?
<treefiddy_>	frontal lobe development
<CuriosTiger>	(only a semi-facetious answer. All humans are animals, by definition.)
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, is this biological?
<treefiddy_>	some have more developed frontal lobes than others, which controls aggression
<treefiddy_>	it's science
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, is it biological?
<treefiddy_>	does biology fall under science?
<treefiddy_>	dumbass
<CuriosTiger>	treefiddy_: There's no correlation between race and frontal lobe development.
<treefiddy_>	lol
<treefiddy_>	there is
<RudyValencia>	any of you guys know much about trademarks?
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, that's all I needed to know
<CuriosTiger>	There's natural variability, but that's the case in every race.
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, you were on my friend's list man
<CuriosTiger>	also affects things like IQ, language skills and personality, not just aggression levels.
<RudyValencia>	I wonder if a trademark's filing date has any significance as to when it is designed (if it's a logo)
<treefiddy_>	aggression is the one that's the most bothersome
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, heh
<CuriosTiger>	treefiddy_: And you have plenty of aggressive whites to prove the point.
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, I guess American settlers weren't agressive toward the Native Americans
<treefiddy_>	oh yea
<CuriosTiger>	Or aggressive anywhere else.
<y0wza>	id say this whole discussion is shit but it dont matter this is ##chat this is irc this is how its supposed to be everything normal resume continue
<CuriosTiger>	*anything
<Audioburn>	Or today's America aggressive toward the middle east
<treefiddy_>	fuck yea they were
<treefiddy_>	and they had the firepower to win
<Audioburn>	killing hundreds of thousands of innocent people for no reason
<CuriosTiger>	Europeans have pretty much been bad news for every other part of the world.
<treefiddy_>	because they developed more technology
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, and this, too, is biological?
<CuriosTiger>	that said, every other part of the world was practicing all kinds of violence on their own
<treefiddy_>	i have no idea
<CuriosTiger>	the europeans were just better at ORGANIZED violence.
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, that's a better answer
<treefiddy_>	i just know that some humans developed technology more rapidly than others
<Audioburn>	You should read Guns, Germs, and Steel
<y0wza>	with 3 trillion billion trillion million variables in play here this whole conversation is pointlez
<treefiddy_>	when we all kind of started at or near the same place
<treefiddy_>	so it's curious why one group did not develop technology
<treefiddy_>	and another group did
<CuriosTiger>	y0wza: Pretty much. Then again, pointless banter is the point of this channel.
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, read Guns, Germs, and Steel
<y0wza>	CuriosTiger, ehehehe
<treefiddy_>	it's not a very interesting topic to me
<treefiddy_>	i wish people would get over it and concentrate on other shit
<CuriosTiger>	treefiddy_: Actually, several groups did.
<Audioburn>	protip: It's not biological and you're a racist
<Voortrekker>	https://youtu.be/NMoeDM8POZk
<Voortrekker>	A WEAPON
<Voortrekker>	TO SURPASS
<treefiddy_>	it's biological
<Voortrekker>	THE METAL GEAR
*	CuriosTiger looks for some aloe vera
<RudyValencia>	Why are some trademarks registered as just text and others as a specific design?
<Audioburn>	It has to do with the development of each culture respective to their environments over long periods of time
<treefiddy_>	mongoloids and caucazoids created technology faster than the other
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, if it's biological, why am I not out stealing?
<Audioburn>	I don't get that part of your logic
<Audioburn>	That's so fucking stupid
<CuriosTiger>	treefiddy_: Mongoloids faster than caucasoids, if you want to use that terminology.
<Audioburn>	Why am I not out robbing people?
<treefiddy_>	fear
<treefiddy_>	size?
<y0wza>	it was all about goals at the time tho
<treefiddy_>	idk you a little guy?
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, wow
<y0wza>	etc etc fuc it
<Audioburn>	I'm 6'1''
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: Protip: He's trolling you.
<CuriosTiger>	...shorty.
<Audioburn>	He's a terrible person
<treefiddy_>	if you say so
<treefiddy_>	but you started it
<treefiddy_>	and i will finish it
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, how did I start it?
<treefiddy_>	:D
<treefiddy_>	scroll up
<Audioburn>	I'm pointing out the truth
<Audioburn>	If you can't handle it that's your problem
<treefiddy_>	i know the truth
<CuriosTiger>	Let's hear the truth according to treefiddy_
<Audioburn>	Yea I want to hear that too
<treefiddy_>	the truth about what
<CuriosTiger>	whatever you know the truth about
<CuriosTiger>	as you just claimed
<treefiddy_>	you're all fucking racists
<treefiddy_>	that's the truth
<CuriosTiger>	I'm not fucking anyone atm.
<CuriosTiger>	(that was a bad pun, btw)
<Audioburn>	lol
*	hmir races on treefiddy_
<TheMesquito>	CuriosTiger: *rimshot*
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, you're the only racist I see here
<treefiddy_>	and how am i racist?
<CuriosTiger>	TheMesquito: Guilty as charged
<treefiddy_>	because i dont side with the rioters?
<treefiddy_>	because i looked at the actual evidence?
<hmir>	I'm all racist, all of th etime!
<CuriosTiger>	treefiddy_: You assumed the only reason Audioburn wasn't out robbing people was because there was some kind of deterrent.
<CuriosTiger>	treefiddy_: It would've been a bit less racist to assume he wasn't out robbing people because he had no interest in robbing people.
<treefiddy_>	CuriosTiger: only after he went off on some tangent. i just let him believe what he wants to believe
<hmir>	Laws are a deterrent.
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, you just said the differences between the technological developments of the different ethnic groups are biological
<treefiddy_>	feeding someone breadcrumbs is different
<treefiddy_>	they arent?
<Audioburn>	and not environmental/cultural
<hmir>	So saying there was some kind of a deterrent is usually true.
<treefiddy_>	oh so you're saying it's because they grew up in the desert
<treefiddy_>	they didnt have the advantages other people had?
<TheMesquito>	Well, I don't think you are a racist, i just think you are dumb. sideing with cirminal and not the actual people trying to change things is retarded as hell
<Audioburn>	There is a whole field on this that says no, and that the biological assumptions are racist.
<CuriosTiger>	hmir: I wouldn't be out robbing you even if it were perfectly legal to do so.
<hmir>	That's conjecture.
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, you need to do some more reading
<treefiddy_>	i said some were aggressive because of lesser developed frontal lobes
<hmir>	We don't know what you would or wouldn't do.
<sunstar>	rumor becomes reality
<treefiddy_>	no i dont really give a shit
<CuriosTiger>	hmir: I know perfectly well what I would do.
<Audioburn>	I'm done with this conversation, you're not qualified to speak, treefiddy_
<TheMesquito>	CuriosTiger: I would rob you any day >:)
<treefiddy_>	im just tired of bitches whining
<treefiddy_>	about not getting their way
<treefiddy_>	:(
<sunstar>	and so MJIC will go down in history
<CuriosTiger>	TheMesquito: That's ok, I have a fly swatter
<Audioburn>	k
<treefiddy_>	wahhhhh
<treefiddy_>	im going to riot
<hmir>	You know perfectly well what you think you would do, based on all of your life experiences living in THIS world with THIS world's laws.
<treefiddy_>	wahhhhh
<treefiddy_>	yer mad cause you got stopped by some cops
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, like the sports rioters
<CuriosTiger>	treefiddy_: Careful so your mom doesn't catch you.
<TheMesquito>	CuriosTiger: MY ONLY WEAKNESS
<treefiddy_>	and now your'e taking it out on everyone
*	TheMesquito dies
<treefiddy_>	Audioburn: they're dumbasses too. i said even bigger dumbasses
<Audioburn>	for stupider reasons haha
<treefiddy_>	but you dont concentrate on that
<CuriosTiger>	TheMesquito: Actually, I believe there's all kinds of fumes and sprays that will also do you in.
<treefiddy_>	you contentrate on what you want to hear
<treefiddy_>	which makes you racist too
<TheMesquito>	Fuck shit
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, I don't deny my racism
<TheMesquito>	We all racist
<CuriosTiger>	TheMesquito: And avoid flying too close to the light!
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, you do
<Audioburn>	that makes you a hypocrit
<treefiddy_>	i told you the first day i met you
<CuriosTiger>	hypocrite.
<TheMesquito>	EVERYONE is racist, its a fucking fact of life ffs
<treefiddy_>	that i am racist
<treefiddy_>	and you have forgotten
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, it has an e?
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, fucl
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: It does.
<treefiddy_>	your problem, not mine
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, oh cool
*	TheMesquito sets things on fire
<sunstar>	FIRE!
*	CuriosTiger runs over TheMesquito with a motorcycle.
*	monoprotic busts out the mallows
<treefiddy_>	yeah im starting an irc riot
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, just know that it's people like you that make the world shitty
<treefiddy_>	you're projecting now Audioburn
<treefiddy_>	cause i look at facts
<Audioburn>	lol ok
<treefiddy_>	and the facts are... people are fucking stupid
<TheMesquito>	I don't side with the rioter nor the cops, they are both equaly retarded
<treefiddy_>	for burning down their own city
<treefiddy_>	because one of their friends didn't get their way
<treefiddy_>	didnt get to commit their crime and fight the cop off to get away with it
<CuriosTiger>	one of their friends didn't get to live
<CuriosTiger>	which is a bit more serious
<sunstar>	thats the story of the tower of babel
<CuriosTiger>	but two wrongs still don't make a right.
<TheMesquito>	or, you know, systemic opperssion by police officers in the area
<treefiddy_>	guess he shouldnt have tried to take a gun from a cop then
<TheMesquito>	That will piss you off right quick
<sunstar>	hmm... need to bust out Metropolis and a video editor and post the story of babel
<treefiddy_>	i guess
<treefiddy_>	i dont know man. ive never even talked to a cop in years
<CuriosTiger>	treefiddy_: No proof he did. In fact, there's strong circumstantial evidence to the contrary.
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, if reincarnation is real, I hope you are born as that blackest black person in the poorest family in the most crime ridden city
<Audioburn>	in America
<treefiddy_>	i was born to the poorest white people in an area
<treefiddy_>	what's the difference
<CuriosTiger>	And it shows!
<treefiddy_>	i got no silver spoon
<Audioburn>	lool
<CuriosTiger>	(sorry, another rimshot)
<treefiddy_>	i got no priveleges
<CuriosTiger>	privileges
<sunstar>	you do actually.  you were born white in america
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, this country was made for you though
<sunstar>	and a man
<treefiddy_>	when you have no argument to go on, attack their grammar
<CuriosTiger>	sunstar: That doesn't get you much.
<sunstar>	the trifecta
<Audioburn>	you fail to acknowledge
<treefiddy_>	yheah
<treefiddy_>	cause ive gotten so many benefits
<treefiddy_>	from being white
<treefiddy_>	lol
<Audioburn>	blacks are leftover slaves here
<treefiddy_>	hahahahahaahahahahaahah
<treefiddy_>	no they arent
<TheMesquito>	I don't trust anyone, cops or a random ass person on the street, just b/c you have a badge and a gun does not mean you are any better then then a person dieing of hunger in the Chicago getto
<treefiddy_>	there is not one person alive that was a slave
<CuriosTiger>	treefiddy_: I corrected your spelling, not your grammar. And I did the same to Audioburn a little while ago.
<sunstar>	well i know being a white girl im sure handed lots of stuff that i wouldnt get if i were a black man.
<Audioburn>	we will never be citizens, to be completely honest
<CuriosTiger>	treefiddy_: I'm trying to help you overcome your disadvantaged background by teaching you English.
<CuriosTiger>	ACCEPT MAH CHARITEE!
<treefiddy_>	CuriosTiger: it's ok. i have a spellechecker and i dont use it
<treefiddy_>	cause i type faster than it reads
<CuriosTiger>	treefiddy_: Same.
<Audioburn>	I say we move back to Africa, like so many racists have shouted
<sunstar>	also, ugly people really get screwed.  if your ugly nothing else matters, your just fucked
<Audioburn>	I dont think it's a bad idea
<CuriosTiger>	Well, I have a different reason. My spell checker doesn't know all the words I use.
*	TheMesquito watches a Audioburn fans the flames
<CuriosTiger>	And it gets very confused if I start typing in another language.
<treefiddy_>	by the time it shows up, im 3 words away and i dont feel like backspacing
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, would you vote for a reparations plan to move black people back to africa?
<treefiddy_>	why?
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: You're assuming Africa wants a bunch of spoiled American brats.
<treefiddy_>	they're here
<treefiddy_>	i doubt africans want them
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, lol, Accra does I think
<treefiddy_>	shit like that never goes well
<treefiddy_>	look at jerusalem
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: May want to look up Ghanaian immigration laws first.
<Audioburn>	I hear when american blacks visit africa they are called white
<CuriosTiger>	sounds like somebody is colorblind.
<TheMesquito>	Also, most "African" - Americans are not even African, that is like saying i'm "Irish" - American, when i have less irish in me then a potato
<CuriosTiger>	Not to mention everybody, considering that "black" is usually some shade of brown and "white" is usually a reddish pink.
<CuriosTiger>	TheMesquito: I was quite amused at one friend lamenting, whenever people tried to be politically correct and call him African-American, that he wasn't American.
<Audioburn>	TheMesquito, black people didnt make up the term
<Audioburn>	we are Post-Slave Africans
<Audioburn>	If we want to get real about it
<Audioburn>	living in America
<Audioburn>	that's the only reason we're here
<Audioburn>	it's fucking stupid
<Audioburn>	humans aren't ready for this shit
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: You're a brown American. Of course, that gets confusing because "brown" usually refers to someone who is arabic or indian
<TheMesquito>	I never said they did, but i don't like the term, due to the fact they are not Afircan, just FUCKING AMERICAN
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, or latino
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: So where in Africa were you born?
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, post-slave dark american then
<Audioburn>	with a destroyed history
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: You know what's in my history?
<Audioburn>	Norway
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: My ancestors would go out to foreign lands
<TheMesquito>	Also, there are many black people in america that have NO slave ansestory at all, i.e came after the Civil war
<CuriosTiger>	and rape, pillage and plunder
<CuriosTiger>	I'm not very proud of that.
<treefiddy_>	who cares
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, well at least you benefit from it now
<treefiddy_>	nobody alive is responsible for the actions of their forefathers
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: Not sure I do. And not sure I want to IF I do.
<treefiddy_>	and i refused to accept any guilt based on the actions of dead people
<pencilandpaper>	since they came after the Civil War, they dont have the ancestry even if their parents or grandparents do?
<Audioburn>	treefiddy_, except for the people that have to deal with it of course
<pbase>	this new httpd is a big pita. for virtual hosts on a single ip, do I have to make separate virtual host configs now or I can club them up in a single config file?anyone...
<pencilandpaper>	wouldnt that mean that they still have that slave ancestry?
<Audioburn>	and those people tend to be at the bottom already
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: We all have to deal with the history of what happened before we were born.
<treefiddy_>	i think they're making it out to be something bigger than it is
<Audioburn>	TheMesquito, only ~3% of black Americans have non-slave ancestery
<Audioburn>	ancestry*
<CuriosTiger>	Inaccurate statistic.
<pencilandpaper>	i dont know, thats just how i think about it..especially when i see some that are obviously american and removed from their german ancestry for like 5 generations still claiming to have german in them..right?
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, look it up
<CuriosTiger>	I'd believe only 3% of black Americans have ONLY non-slave ancestry.
<treefiddy_>	time to party
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, are you fucking kidding??
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, the rest would all have to be immigrants
<sunstar>	?
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: Your statement is the equivalent of saying that 97% of black Americans have ONLY slave ancestry.
<CuriosTiger>	and due to interbreeding alone, that's patently false.
<TheMesquito>	Also, my family came to American in the elery 1900 from Ireland, in a time in america when Irishmen where treated just as bad as blacks where, so don't give me "your anescotrs never expericed raceism" shit
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: 99.9% of Americans are descended from "immigrants"
<pbase>	why is color being discussed?? isn't it obvious that it could be offensive to many?
<pencilandpaper>	what does that have to do with anything TheMesquito . so you are part irish..or are you too far removed to have irish in you?
<sunstar>	im a woman.   we been held down since dawn of time
<CuriosTiger>	pbase: Which colors offend you?
<sunstar>	whee!
<Fowler>	Man, Hercules had some crazy abs
<Fowler>	https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/4f/a1/63/4fa1639eb1cf326a2e1b4021717fdfbc.jpg
<Fowler>	Look at dem obliques
<pbase>	CuriosTiger: esp black AND white
<pencilandpaper>	your statement was trash was basically what i was saying TheMesquito , completely slow in fact. :)
<pencilandpaper>	have a good one i am going back to watching a movie. comment on the comment amongst yourselves. goodnight peoples. :)
<CuriosTiger>	pbase: Those aren't colors at all. White is a mix of all colors. Black is the absence of light. And if you couldn't tell, I'm being deliberately obtuse.
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, I'm getting you the actual statistic
<pbase>	CuriosTiger: don't talk like a braindead contextless dimwit
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: Most black Americans are of mixed ancestry. Frequently including some caucasian genes from a horny slaveowner or three.
<TheMesquito>	Why the fuck to people dewll on slavery in american anyway, EVERY. GODDAMN. CONTRY. has used slavery once before
<TheMesquito>	Some still use Slavery today
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, 85-90% http://www.oread.ku.edu/Oread05/Feb18/slavery.html
<TheMesquito>	Why is America so demonized for it?
<Audioburn>	you mean a rapist
<pbase>	it is sad that people still discuss slavery and colors after years of torment.
<Fowler>	TheMesquito: Recent, huge extent
<Fowler>	It's one of the more important aspects of our history
<Audioburn>	^
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: Read up. My statements do not disagree with the article you pasted.
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: Look up the difference between "any" and "only", in particular.
<Audioburn>	I wasn't arguing for only
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: Then we have no disagreement.
<Audioburn>	alright
<Audioburn>	I was going to say that earlier but got distracted
<TheMesquito>	Recent? 149 is recent? There are country that have commited WORSE atrositys in that time period, and yet all people can do is codem america for something EVERYONE did
<TheMesquito>	*years
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: From the article: "Previous research indicates that 40 percent to 70 percent of African-Americans have European ancestry." --that was my only point.
<Fowler>	TheMesquito: Yes, that's crazily recent. And no, not every country has utilized slavery to the same extent so recently
<CuriosTiger>	TheMesquito: Two wrongs don't make a right.
<TheMesquito>	I understand that
<CuriosTiger>	TheMesquito: Also, atrocities.
<CuriosTiger>	TheMesquito: But when something is condemnable, the fact that other countries do it too is no reason not to condemn America for it.
<Audioburn>	You ask why bring slavery up
<CuriosTiger>	Rather the opposite: It's a reason to condemn those other countries too.
<TheMesquito>	But shit, it happed 149 years ago, but yet i still get demonized for it, even though my ancestors never owned any slaves?
<y0wza>	http://ivebencrazy.github.io/BigDaddy/
<Fowler>	You don't get demonized for it
<Fowler>	Stop exaggerating
<CuriosTiger>	TheMesquito: Are you Uncle Sam?
<CuriosTiger>	Otherwise, I don't see how demonizing a nation is the same as demonizing you personally.
<Audioburn>	Slavery is brought up because America has not yet come to terms with it
<Audioburn>	nor the Native Americans
<Audioburn>	it's always shoved under the rug
<CuriosTiger>	TheMesquito: Can I not criticize anything the United States does without it being a personal attack on you?
<Audioburn>	people are getting angrier
<swift110-phone>	Hmm true
<Audioburn>	it's only a matter of time
<gogisadj>	... K
<y0wza>	Big Data
<sunstar>	IaaS
<y0wza>	big daddy
<Fowler>	TheMesquito: Slavery is more recent in the US than in the UK, for instance, and it played a larger role in our history. I mean, it just seems like you don't know history very well
<y0wza>	this subject bout 2 get derailed
<gogisadj>	Oh shit
<sunstar>	i hope so
<sunstar>	getting a lil tiresome

<swift110-phone>	Who has it?
<TheMesquito>	CuriosTiger: Yeah, i agree with that, i just don't like the fact that im assumed racist just because i am white
<y0wza>	idk if i still do
<Fowler>	There are people alive right now whose great grandparents were slaves
<Fowler>	That's crazy
<gogisadj>	HOLY SHITTING ASS
<sunstar>	ive been trying to play supertuxcart since 2000 and its never worked on my hardware
<gogisadj>	SUPERTUXCART
<gogisadj>	I don't know that game
<sunstar>	but that light cycle game has always worked great (and frozen bubble)
<y0wza>	suuuper
<pbase>	installing now
<swift110-phone>	Hmm
<gogisadj>	Is it similar to Tux Racer,
<gogisadj>	I know Tux Racer
<pbase>	thanks.. for changing the crappy topic
<Fowler>	TheMesquito: Some small minority of people assume you're racist because you're white, boo hoo
<Fowler>	Who cares?

<Fowler>	carabiner*
<Fowler>	Ledge
<Audioburn>	oh ok cool
<Fowler>	Audioburn: Is there a ledge nearby? With a nice crisp 90 degree angle?
<sunstar>	use your thumb as the fulcrum Audioburn
<sunstar>	i dont think i've even had to use that word b4 today  :P
<pbase>	Audioburn: try to find an irritating friend's head...
<sunstar>	that'll shake it up though
<sunstar>	cant be wasting precious beer
<gogisadj>	Hammer a nail into the lid
<TheMesquito>	NOT THE BEER
<y0wza>	break the top off
<hmir>	You've never needed to use the worlf fulcrum before?
<gogisadj>	Axe it open
<sunstar>	nope. only in my head have i ever said it
<pbase>	how can beer be precious? it is among the cheapest/abundant drinks available on earth after water
<Fowler>	Ugh
<Fowler>	I need to sleep
<Fowler>	Boo
<sunstar>	the human race can thank its continued existence on beer
<Fowler>	I wish gruit beer would come back into style
<sunstar>	without it, yall would have died of water bourne ilnesses
<Fowler>	I wouldn't have
<TheMesquito>	sunstar: Beer for everyone
<sunstar>	you wouldnt be alive
*	TheMesquito pours beer
<Fowler>	sunstar: I wouldn't have died, either
<sunstar>	true
<swift110-phone>	Supertuxkart is a great game
<gogisadj>	sunstar: now I think about it, how can beer get dirty during production?
<Fowler>	Pretty easily
<diogenese>	It's easy to play.
<gogisadj>	Does anyone know anything about that?
<Fowler>	What do you mean by "dirty?"
<gogisadj>	Not clean
<pbase>	Fowler: I think he is referring to the diameter of the beer bottle...
<Fowler>	An errant breeze or not properly sanitizing equipment = contamination instantly
<TheMesquito>	Fowler: Dirty as in dirt maybe?
<gogisadj>	TheMesquito: close enough
<Fowler>	I don't think he means soil in the beer
<gogisadj>	I mean like nasty bacteria
<Fowler>	Right, then it's easy. Wind blowing through without your vessel covered, not sanitizing your vessel or anything that comes into contact with the beer
<pbase>	it is already fermented... isn't it?
<gogisadj>	Actually, I haven't even seen a beer factory
<Fowler>	It doesn't start out fermented and the wrong bacteria in the wort pre-fermentation can lead to unwanted results
<TheMesquito>	Well, anything can get that if you don't properly sanitize things and/or protecting from outside bacteria
<gogisadj>	I'm gonna Google that
<Fowler>	Off flavors, dangerous compounds, etc.
<pbase>	that actually appplies to any fluid per se
<TheMesquito>	The way they make beer is fascinating though
<pbase>	edible*
<pbase>	supertuxkart ho!
<pbase>	its a big 200 mb download.. who would play that???
<TheMesquito>	I love how Supertuxkart has been out forever and still is only 0.9
<TheMesquito>	pbase: I mean, most major games are like 20 GB nowadays anyhow
<diogenese>	I keep a local mirror, so installed fast.
<Fowler>	Germinate barley, steep in hot water, boil with malt and hops and such, ferment dat shit
<sunstar>	brewtarget ftw
<gogisadj>	That was very steampunk
<gogisadj>	With the big metal barrels and stuff
<pbase>	do you find enough time to play games?? I mean most games now demand like 3-4 hours of continued time dvotion
<pbase>	I think its safe enough to assume more size = more time
<CuriosTiger>	TheMesquito: I didn't even assume you were white :P
<gogisadj>	pbase: Not continued devotion
<Fowler>	I don't assume anyone on IRC looks like anything
<Fowler>	I don't even imagine you as people
<gogisadj>	Fowler: correct
<sunstar>	yall r just pixels
<Fowler>	I just see you as idea machines that pump out words for me to read

*	CuriosTiger is approximately lobster red today
<Fowler>	I don't imagine a person sitting at a computer typing and having emotional responses

<TheMesquito>	On the internet, no one knows you are a dog
<gogisadj>	And the usernames
<CuriosTiger>	That's a dangerous thing to do to a tiger :P

*	TheMesquito hits the disco ball switch
<Audioburn>	they see me mowin
*	CuriosTiger has to mow tomorrow
<TheMesquito>	They laughing
<hmir>	Cats are not chatty at all.
<gogisadj>	I didn't even see that disco ball
<CuriosTiger>	No slaves here to do it for me.
<CuriosTiger>	(was that wrong?)
<diogenese>	via keyboard they are.
<hmir>	NOPE!
<CuriosTiger>	Cats mostly ignore you, while at the same time making it impossible to ignore THEM
<hmir>	That's grown men masquerading as cats.
<gogisadj>	CuriosTiger: bit outta nowhere
*	TheMesquito hands CuriosTiger an express ticket to hell
<gogisadj>	But not that wrong
*	CuriosTiger decides to miss that particular bus.
<CuriosTiger>	gogisadj: It was in response to Audioburn's comment "they see me mowin"
<swift110-phone>	Hmm
<gogisadj>	CuriosTiger: I thought it was about you having to mow tomorrow
<sunstar>	2 tweakers got arrested for selling gold tickets to heaven for $99 each. they were arrested because they misrepresented themselves as saying the tickets were real gold when in fact it was gold spray paint.  so if you wanna make some money, you should sell some tickets to heaven
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, oh haha closed the client. Your comment would have been offensive if you were treefiddy_
<TheMesquito>	CuriosTiger: What if purgatory is just one big bus stop and you can just never get on one for eternity :O
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, but I know you treat all humans equally (ha)
<CuriosTiger>	TheMesquito: One of the Matrix movies had a scene kind of like that.
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: Not at all.
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: I discriminate based on how much I like people.
<Audioburn>	I'm talking about with respect to race
<Audioburn>	and you acknowledge history
<Audioburn>	thats a big one
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: Race isn't a good predictor for how much I like someone.
<Audioburn>	you dont have to feel bad, just acknowledge it happened
<hmir>	You're a sex symbol!
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, same, everyone is so different
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: The only people my ancestors enslaved were other whites, mainly from other parts of Europe
<TheMesquito>	Also, to be clear, i know exactly what happend in history, and think its fucked up. I was just stiring the pot to see how mad i could get people
<gogisadj>	Mmmbop, da ba, doowop
*	gogisadj has sinned 
*	CuriosTiger has sinned too
<CuriosTiger>	I try not to do it on purpose

<gogisadj>	Is it alright if it's part of a mashup?
<Audioburn>	just kidding, no they dont come close
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: Fanatics are generally bad, regardless of flavor.
<Fowler>	coldsparrow: Hey
<TheMesquito>	Audioburn: Something we can all agree on
<Audioburn>	but they're pretty obnoxious
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, TheMesquito right haha
<Fowler>	coldsparrow: Make summer not happen plz
<Fowler>	It's going to be way too hot
<Fowler>	I'm going to be miserable for months at a time
<sunstar>	anyone seen commercials for the art institute where they show a student using a touch screen to create a CG creature? any idea what app that is?
<Audioburn>	let me tell me give you all a warning if you all didn't know
<coldsparrow>	Fowler, talk to0 gaeia
*	TheMesquito sends Fowler too Antarctica
<Audioburn>	there's nothing more a black person hates more than a racist
<CuriosTiger>	I had a crush on a black girl once.
<CuriosTiger>	Her dad didn't like white guys.
<Audioburn>	Black people are racist too, obviously
<Audioburn>	But its racism that racism produced
<TheMesquito>	Damn Socts! They ruined Scotland!
<CuriosTiger>	I was kind of disappointed. She was cute, smart, and sucked at math.
<swift110-phone>	Summer is awesome
<gogisadj>	Shout out to http://neilcic.com/mouthsilence/

<gogisadj>	Late autumn too :( this is bullocks
<Audioburn>	oh ok, are you putting your linguistics expertise to any use, CuriosTiger ?
<gogisadj>	I'm not having the same convo as you guys, sorry
<CuriosTiger>	audioburn: Yes, to correct people's spelling and grammar on IRC. :-P
<Audioburn>	lol
<CuriosTiger>	gogisadj: Are you Australian?
<Audioburn>	when I go back to school I want to major in CompSci and Music
<Audioburn>	Dropped out last year
<TheMesquito>	CuriosTiger, they took Linguistics just so they could be a Grammer Nazi on IRC :D
*	CuriosTiger wouldn't want to live in NYC.
<gogisadj>	CuriosTiger: down under them, really, NZ
<CuriosTiger>	That city is crowded, dirty, smelly and everyone is rude and in a hurry.
<TheMesquito>	NYC seems like it would smell
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, it's not that bad
<CuriosTiger>	(yes, stereotyping)
<Audioburn>	everyone says it's so bad
<CuriosTiger>	themesquito: And it does.
<Audioburn>	i like it
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: I've been there over a dozen times.
<gogisadj>	NYC is neat because the street layout is sweet
<Audioburn>	it's super expensive though
<jenni>	oh baby
<Audioburn>	I'm paying 1.1k/mo for a ROOM
<CuriosTiger>	gogisadj: You find that street layout -- the grid -- in most American cities.
<Audioburn>	not an apt, a room
<CuriosTiger>	audioburn: I'm paying $3K/mo for a house.
<TheMesquito>	But then again, people might think Dallas smells, just due to the fact that they ate not used to it
<gogisadj>	Auckland street layout is pppbbbbggfgsgdg
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, that'll get you a studio in manhattan
<CuriosTiger>	Dallas smells like barbecue. That I won't complain about.
<CuriosTiger>	The smelly part of Texas is places like Luling or Beaumont or Odessa.
<Audioburn>	I've got family in Odessa
<Audioburn>	Been there a few times
<TheMesquito>	Luling?
<CuriosTiger>	I went to a taekwon-do tournament in Odessa once
*	TheMesquito looks at map
<Audioburn>	I do remember a smell but I dont know if it was all that bad
<CuriosTiger>	Themesquito: Small town. But the entire place smells of crude oil.
<Audioburn>	Like oil or something
<CuriosTiger>	it's way east of Odessa
<Audioburn>	yea haha
<TheMesquito>	"Luling /ꜛlu̟ː.liŋ/ is a city in Caldwell and Guadalupe counties, Texas, United State" neat
<CuriosTiger>	NYC, however, smells like garbage.
<Audioburn>	Midland has a nice skyline for a small town
<CuriosTiger>	Literally.
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, and piss
<Audioburn>	dont forget piss
<TheMesquito>	I know where Guadalupe county is
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: That too.
<CuriosTiger>	I do not like the smell of NYC.
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, but your nyc life dramatically improves once your money does
<CuriosTiger>	in fact, I was 30 miles from NYC on Wed-Fri, and I avoided entering the city.
<Audioburn>	Everyone is trying to make it
<TheMesquito>	Also, New Orlands seems like it would smell also
<CuriosTiger>	audioburn: Money enables you to leave. Why stay?
<TheMesquito>	^HA
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, where would I go
<CuriosTiger>	audioburn: We had this discussion.
<TheMesquito>	New Jersey?
<CuriosTiger>	Ew.
<Audioburn>	It's always a question
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: I suggested Canada.
<Audioburn>	You did
<CuriosTiger>	Of course, I'm personally partial to Florida and Texas.
<Audioburn>	fuck the South, no offense
<Audioburn>	well, not the WHOLE south
<TheMesquito>	Heh, telling a New Yorker to move to New Jersey is like telling someone from Dallas to move to Houston
<CuriosTiger>	None taken.
<CuriosTiger>	TheMesquito: So, an improvement.
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, ha!
<Audioburn>	I dont understand the dallas/houston beef
*	CuriosTiger hides from TheMesquito
<Audioburn>	I was born and raised in DFW
<DFrostedWang>	can confirm, it was unpleasant
<Audioburn>	Dallas kinda sucks
*	CuriosTiger likes Houston better, although he's not really sure why
<Fowler>	I'm going to be uncomfortable until October
<Fowler>	:(
*	TheMesquito is not even in Dallas, so does not give a fuck about the Dallas/Houston beef
<TheMesquito>	I like both cites
<CuriosTiger>	I think it's because I wound up in a hospital in Dallas
<grayC>	oops the dogs got out
<TheMesquito>	but fuck austin
<TheMesquito>	:D
<CuriosTiger>	If you're ever injured in Dallas, don't let them take you to the Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas. Ever.
<grayC>	where is DFW
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, very slightly traumatic haha
<DFrostedWang>	Right here
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: Yeah. Plus Dallas gets cold in winter.
<CuriosTiger>	and the roads are complete shit
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, shouldve gone to north dallas
<CuriosTiger>	they PAVE them with potholes.
<Error418>	fuck texass.
<Audioburn>	lol
<TheMesquito>	grayC: Dallas/Fort Worth and the surrounding counties in North Central Texas
<Audioburn>	Error418, word
<grayC>	you were bron and raised on defroated wang Audioburn ?
<grayC>	ph ok thx
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: I'll remember that for next time.
<CuriosTiger>	I'm pretty sure that hospital could've killed healthy people
<Audioburn>	grayC, lol
<grayC>	lol
<TheMesquito>	Audioburn: If you want to know shit roads, go to Balch Springs, Texas, the roads are pure shit there
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, aim for the suburbs
<sunstar>	kaiser kills
<grayC>	i dont think it is very nice there is it?
<CuriosTiger>	audioburn: Like Plano, the heroin capital of the world?
<Audioburn>	I think big city hospitals dont give a fuck
<jenni>	I'm 18 how old are you
<grayC>	do you still live there Audioburn ?
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, that's where I was raised lol
<Audioburn>	grayC, I'm in nyc now
<CuriosTiger>	Audioburn: They gave a fuck about making me sign a disclaimer and getting my credit card info
<grayC>	nice
<TheMesquito>	Ah, good ole' Plano
<gogisadj>	+jenni: 6
<Audioburn>	whatchall know about plano
<Audioburn>	We have some of the best schools in the nation
<TheMesquito>	Personly, i got to Baylor if i have a choice in the matter
<CuriosTiger>	I had a roommate from Plano. Several people in his high school graduating class never graduated because they died of drug overdoses.
<Audioburn>	CuriosTiger, yea it was a big problem for a while
<CuriosTiger>	My ex-landlady's daughter teaches in Plano currently. K12
<CuriosTiger>	She seems to like it.
<grayC>	thata very sad for their parents
<grayC>	all that time and effort raising them for nothing
<sunstar>	in 1993 i drove through the panhandle and saw nothing.  nothing at all.
<CuriosTiger>	grayC: That was part of the problem
<Audioburn>	I knew a guy who overdosed. We fought in middle school once
<sunstar>	drove through an entire state and saw nothing
<CuriosTiger>	grayC: A lot of these parents didn't spend much time actually raising their children. Instead, they just threw money at the problem
<sunstar>	not even a hujman
<TheMesquito>	Na, Plano is nice, but there are some shithole cites in the Metroplex
<sunstar>	human*?
<CuriosTiger>	either for nannies or directly at the kids
<grayC>	whole country is like that here sunstar
<grayC>	except the novelty BG thingd
<grayC>	big things
<grayC>	the big pineapple banana crab etc
<Audioburn>	if you ever fly
<Audioburn>	there's so much fucking empty land
<CuriosTiger>	Austin would be my first choice if I was going to live in Texas.
<CuriosTiger>	My second choice would be somewhere outside of Houston. Like Spring or Cypress.
*	hubik gives grayC a kangaroo saddle
<grayC>	why would you even decide to live in texas
<Audioburn>	loool
*	TheMesquito personly would live as far away from a big city
<CuriosTiger>	grayC: I like it there?
*	coldsparrow lives in spring.
<Fowler>	The only place I'd ever want to live is Washington
<hubik>	mrnng :)
<Audioburn>	Hey
<coldsparrow>	it' shitty
<Audioburn>	I actually really liked Portland
<grayC>	gm hubik ty for the saddle
<CuriosTiger>	coldsparrow: How so?
*	hassoon claps
<TheMesquito>	Texas is nice, contray to popular belief
<Audioburn>	despite it being the whitest major city
<Audioburn>	I was considering there
<Audioburn>	again
<grayC>	yea pass on texas thx
<CuriosTiger>	coldsparrow: It's far enough out of the city to be safe and have reasonably spacious lots, yet close enough that you can drive to anything.
<Audioburn>	I felt like a human being there
<CuriosTiger>	The pacific northwest has its advantages
<CuriosTiger>	work really wanted me to move to Seattle
<CuriosTiger>	I refused, but mostly for family reasons
<TheMesquito>	CuriosTiger: Colony is outside of Houston, correct? or am i thinking of Dallas
<grayC>	Audioburn: lets go to hawaiii
<Audioburn>	Seattle is nice (so far as I remember -- went there when i was 13)
<grayC>	ooo ooo ooo do you wanna come along with me
<CuriosTiger>	TheMesquito: Isn't that up by Denton?
<CuriosTiger>	Seattle is full of drug addicts and homeless people.
<Fowler>	Seattle is the best
<TheMesquito>	OH Wait! I'm thinking of the Woodlands
<grayC>	how did hawaii ever become a state of americaha?
<Fowler>	Best weather, good music, good jobs, good food
<TheMesquito>	The Colony is in DFW
*	grayC laughs
<CuriosTiger>	If I was going to live in WA, I'd probably pick somewhere like Bellevue
<DFrostedWang>	No, I'm DFW
<CuriosTiger>	grayC: American plantation owners staged a coup d'etat.
<Fowler>	Beaches, rain forsts, temperate forests, mountains, desert all within a few hours
<Audioburn>	grayC, hawaii seems nice
<TheMesquito>	DFrostedWang: HA
<grayC>	yes very nice indeed
<grayC>	especially maui
<DFrostedWang>	I swear every other week you guys are talking about me
<grayC>	they rake the beaches there you know
<Audioburn>	rake the beaches?
<CuriosTiger>	they rake the beaches here too
<Audioburn>	whats that?
<grayC>	and wash the palm trees
<CuriosTiger>	except during sea turtle hatching season
<Audioburn>	what for? cleaning?
<CuriosTiger>	because then raking the beaches could kill the hatchlings
<CuriosTiger>	basically.
<grayC>	idk why they do it
<CuriosTiger>	palm trees have a sticky sap
<TheMesquito>	I personly would like to live in Central texas, away from everything
<Fowler>	Makes it look nicer, makes it nicer to walk in
<grayC>	never seen so many cut orchids as they foyer in the resort on mui
<CuriosTiger>	Hawaii probably doesn't want tourists getting that on their hands
<grayC>	+a
<CuriosTiger>	because everything has to be artificial.
<Audioburn>	TheMesquito, I know someone who did that
<Fowler>	Seattle > Hawaii
<CuriosTiger>	Hawaii is too far from everything.
<CuriosTiger>	I've grown pretty fond of Florida.
<Fowler>	Florida is too hot
<TheMesquito>	Anchorage > Seattle
<CuriosTiger>	Texas is hotter.
<Audioburn>	Multimillionaire, a healthcare mogul, met him at a church. Population of the city is literally in the hundreds
<Fowler>	No
<CuriosTiger>	but heat doesn't bother me.
<grayC>	america is too far from everything
<Fowler>	Lol
<Fowler>	Anchorage sucks compared to Seattle
<TheMesquito>	But i love Alaska
<TheMesquito>	So i'm biased
<CuriosTiger>	Fowler: Florida rarely gets much hotter than 90-92F
<Fowler>	CuriosTiger: That's vastly too hot
<CuriosTiger>	Texas can have 100+ temps for months on end.
<grayC>	some guys say to me , get on a plane come to america
<grayC>	sorry too far
<Fowler>	And it's more than the absolute temperature
<Fowler>	It's the humidity
<Fowler>	And I wasn't saying Texas isn't hotter
<Fowler>	They're both way too fucking hot
<TheMesquito>	CuriosTiger: Plz take out 110 degree, 100% Humidity D:
<CuriosTiger>	I'll take hot over cold anyday
<Fowler>	The sun is hotter than Texas, doesn't mean Texas isn't way too fucking hot
<Audioburn>	I'll take neither
<grayC>	always hot here
<CuriosTiger>	TheMesquito: I've gone jogging in that weather before.
<Fowler>	Cold is way better than hot
<Fowler>	Just add layers
<Audioburn>	Fowler, NO
<CuriosTiger>	Fowler: Ok, you can have the spot I vacated in Norway
<Audioburn>	lol
<grayC>	no i die if it goes under 18c
<Fowler>	It's easier to get warm than to get cold
<Fowler>	Just add layers
<Fowler>	Too hot? You're fucked
<Fowler>	Can't go outside
<CuriosTiger>	I go outside every day
<grayC>	yea i go lay in the spring fed creek
<LauraCottonTail>	"There are both way too fucking Hot" for a second I thought I was witnessing the first conversation about girls ever on freenode
*	TheMesquito is glad that summer has decieds to hold off for a bit in texas
<Fowler>	Can't go outside comfortably without being submurged in water*
<CuriosTiger>	Fowler: For that, Florida has plenty of beaches.
<LauraCottonTail>	Then I saw you were talking about the whether
<TheMesquito>	But once all this rain stops, its gonna be hot as shit
<CuriosTiger>	Hell, I have a pond here on the property
<Fowler>	Fuck beaches
<Fowler>	Fuck having to be submerged in water
<Fowler>	I want to walk around comfortably
<hubik>	pile on Fowler !!!
<Fowler>	At all times
<Audioburn>	ha
<LauraCottonTail>	Ok now you're confusing me on purpose
<CuriosTiger>	let me tell you something
<grayC>	we had a month over 40c here last summer
<Fowler>	I don't want to sweat the second I step outside
<LauraCottonTail>	"Fuck beaches"
<grayC>	i got a bit delerious
<CuriosTiger>	when you're putting on the fifth layer and the snot is freezing to ice inside your nose, ain't nuthin' comfortable about it.
<LauraCottonTail>	Anyway
<Fowler>	CuriosTiger: Comfortable enough for me unless it's like -20F outside
<CuriosTiger>	fowler: I remember -40F
<TheMesquito>	Also, it always is raining in Washington, who would want to live there :V
<sunstar>	sounds like a few places i've done work
<CuriosTiger>	Well, I remember -40C
<grayC>	what happens if its snowing and you are druk and fall over
<Fowler>	TheMesquito: Not even always raining
<TheMesquito>	jk, i love WA
<CuriosTiger>	but those two happen to be the same thing
<Fowler>	Summer and spring is dry
<grayC>	you would just die
<Fowler>	And when it does rain it doesn't rain very hard
<sunstar>	washington is going through a drought (as is most of the planet)
<Fowler>	It's just cloudy a lot
<Fowler>	And I love clouds
<CuriosTiger>	grayc: That happens to a few drunks back home every year
<grayC>	i dnt even think people should live in cold places where it snows
<CuriosTiger>	hardly ever happens to sober people :P
<Fowler>	CuriosTiger: Why does it have to be 100F or -40F?
<Fowler>	Why not just 30F-70F?
<Fowler>	Like in WASHINGTON
<grayC>	we should reserve those places for frozen food stroage or somthing
*	TheMesquito moves to Canada
<CuriosTiger>	Fowler: I didn't say it had to. Just saying I've personally experienced both and I prefer 100F to -40F.
<grayC>	all that heating so people can live there is bad
<LauraCottonTail>	Audioburn:  why do you hate me
<CuriosTiger>	Fowler: My preferred temperature range is between 70 and 90 degrees.
<Fowler>	-40F is more extreme than 100F I'd say
<Audioburn>	LauraCottonTail, I don't, I thought you hated me
<CuriosTiger>	Fowler: Agreed.
<Fowler>	-40F is more like 110-120F
<grayC>	100F? that aint even hot
<sunstar>	that seed storage facility in the arctic? yeah it was an abysmal failure.  seeds are all no longer viable
<CuriosTiger>	Fowler: The hottest I've experienced is +131F. I'd take that over -40F too, although I agree 131F is too hot.
<grayC>	id need a cardigan if it were only100f
<LauraCottonTail>	You don't reply when I ask you questions
<Fowler>	Eh, -40F with a balaklava isn't bad
<sunstar>	sounds like the mojave
<CuriosTiger>	Yes. It. Is.
<CuriosTiger>	sunstar: It was, actually. :P
<hubik>	happy monday LauraCottonTail :)
<Fowler>	CuriosTiger: Eh
<LauraCottonTail>	Are you guys seriously just keeping on talking about the whether
<Fowler>	I'd take -40F with proper clothing over 100F
<grayC>	its WEATHER laura
<Fowler>	There is no clothing available that makes 100F comfortable
<LauraCottonTail>	Sorry
<TheMesquito>	"Patrolling the Mojave makes you wish for a nuclear winter"
<Fowler>	There is, for me, clothing available to make -40F close enough to comfortable
<CuriosTiger>	Fowler: I'm glad we disagree. If everyone liked the same thing, everyone would cluster in the same spots, and that'd be bad.
<LauraCottonTail>	Bikini and hat
<Fowler>	Not even close
<CuriosTiger>	fowler: I'm comfortable in 100F wearing jeans and a t-shirt.
<Fowler>	I can be butt naked and 100F is too hot
<Fowler>	Butt naked in the shade
<grayC>	100f isnt hot man
<Fowler>	100F is hot.
<CuriosTiger>	fowler: People's heat and cold tolerances are different.
<Fowler>	CuriosTiger: I'm aware.
<LauraCottonTail>	Stop saying the word butt
<Fowler>	I'm not saying this applies to anyone else
<CuriosTiger>	fowler: For example, I have low blood pressure. That means I get cold very easily.
<TheMesquito>	Bottom
<grayC>	i better see if i can get the dogs in
<grayC>	i already know i cant
<Fowler>	CuriosTiger: I'm not saying this applies to anyone else
<Fowler>	I keep saying "for me" and referring specifically to me for a reason
<CuriosTiger>	grayc: bad dogs?
<grayC>	yes
<grayC>	they would have made it to the swamp by now i hate going there
<grayC>	there are crocodiles
<Fowler>	There are people who think 70F is cold
<Fowler>	Obviously people are different
*	CuriosTiger is ok with 70F. 60F is getting chilly though.
<Fowler>	50F and cloudy is ideal
<CuriosTiger>	burr.
<grayC>	18c is too cold here
<Fowler>	I don't have any burrs
<Fowler>	I sharpen my knives properly
<CuriosTiger>	Onomatopoeic burr. As you well knew.
<Fowler>	That's BRR
<Fowler>	GEEZE
*	CuriosTiger hits Fowler upside the head with a cricket bat.
*	Fowler is wearing a football helmet
<coldsparrow>	lol.
<CuriosTiger>	Won't help you. I took a good swing.
<Fowler>	It helped plenty
*	Fowler barely felt anything
<Fowler>	You gotta work on your swing bro
<CuriosTiger>	Naw, I gotta work on my sleep.
<Fowler>	Me too
<Fowler>	Bleh

<lala>	Handstands are not healthy when doing them over 3 minutes.
<lala>	Or so.
<hubik>	how did you measure that lalala?
<lala>	I don't measure it. I just thought of the pressure regulation involved.
<LauraCottonTail>	I can handstand
<LauraCottonTail>	But I'm a gymnast so
<LauraCottonTail>	It's kind of not impressive
<LauraCottonTail>	I can do more impressive stuff on a beam
<sunstar>	i can hurt myself
<lala>	That's great.
<LauraCottonTail>	That would be impressive to watch I'm sure
<sunstar>	:P
<lala>	The point is homeostatic pressure regulation.
<LauraCottonTail>	The point is abs and back
<sunstar>	http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/11/test-yourself-emoji-on-instagram/

<grayC>	i went off my nut at her when she came home
<lala>	Tell your son.
<grayC>	i told him shes a trap
<grayC>	no-one likes her
<sunstar>	they dont have to like each other, but grayC does have to stop enabling / rewarding bad behavior
<lala>	Well then I guess it's your son's fault for not listening.
<grayC>	im cutting him loose
<Butt3rfly>	well you're not going to win any favours with your son by hating her, just sayin'
<grayC>	fro m her
<Butt3rfly>	he obviously likes her
<lala>	grayC: Perhaps you need counseling.
<grayC>	yea he really appreciated my help today because she had told him to clean up before she got home
<grayC>	haha no thx lala
<lala>	...
<lala>	But counseling is helpful.
<grayC>	i know what i am doing i will break them up
<Narp>	grayC you are weak
<sunstar>	no grayC seriously. this is not okay
<SimenOlai>	plot twist, he's trolling

<lala>	tortib: Don't even start.
<tortib>	lala, it isn't
<grayC>	i do not want to assocaite with that fmily.
<sunstar>	he lost your only car key and you rewarded him by cleaning his mess and doing his laundry.  how is this in any way acceptable behavior by either prty?
<Butt3rfly>	looks like you don't have much say in the matter grayC

<y0wza>	w/e since they brINGIN IT BACK
<lala>	K-cups.

<hassoon>	lulz
<lala>	Oh.
<lala>	The one that has the thing you can put coffee in. Right?
<Sabotender>	its going to cost me a cool 80USD to get one. I can either get the keurig or a new keyboard. Since I dont really NEED that mechanical keyboard, the coffee/tea maker would actually be of great use, since my coffee maker is on its last leg :-P
<y0wza>	no its a toaster
<treefiddy_>	i have something to put in you
<treefiddy_>	but it's not coffee
<hubik>	is it black?

<lala>	Black coffee?
<treefiddy_>	yea
<lala>	I'll have to be right back.
<treefiddy_>	it's black cofeee
<Sabotender>	its just that single serve coffee makers are so useful, I mean its only me here and all i want is a single cup. saves wasting tea and coffee

<boz>	sunstar: even windows/microsoft?
<boz>	gamma: we'll have to wait and see

<grayC>	netflix and all that bah
<Sabotender>	...unless you patch it
<gamma>	I like Netflix.
<boz>	Sabotender: there'll be more of that
<gamma>	I also like Google Play Music, but there you go.
<grayC>	i only use pirate stuff
<gamma>	Netflix is ridiculously cheap for what it gives you.
<sunstar>	i hate the world
<sunstar>	i want off
<grayC>	doesnt matter gamma

<grayC>	its stopping you from torrenting
<gamma>	So?
<gamma>	Why is that a bad thing?
<y0wza>	less u catched it earlier
<sunstar>	what is it.   i dont watch videos so your gonna have to make a case for why i should
<gamma>	Content creators should be paid for their work.
<jenni>	oh baby
<y0wza>	cus its 22 seconds
<y0wza>	and its bout the earth
<boz>	sunstar: no, buckle up
<y0wza>	and spoiler warning
<boz>	sunstar: and empty your pockets

<boz>	[10:23:20] <gamma> Content creators should be paid for their work. << i think you miss the point of the mod community
<dw1>	they're all pir8s
<gamma>	boz: Fine. Content creators should be paid for their work if they feel they want it.
<boz>	they're not professional, they do it out of love, 95% of mods are too shite to be charging you anything
<gamma>	Especially if it's a job, and not an on-the-side project.
<gamma>	Besides, I was talking about pirating vs buying games/netflix subscriptions/music streaming subscriptions and so on
<dw1>	sup raf
<boz>	if its their job then they're not bloody modders; they're devs
<grayC>	hi dw1
<gamma>	Are you missing the point on purpose?
<dw1>	sup grayC
<boz>	come at me bro
<grayC>	nada
<bazhang>	its irc the answer to pedantry is always yes
<Sabotender>	hi bazhang
<bazhang>	sup sabo
<gamma>	boz: I even clarified what I was talking about, and that didn't include mods. If we're specifically talking about games, I think it's incredibly shitty to pirate games rather than buying them considering how cheap Steam actually is with its practically 24/7 sales.
<dw1>	jquery is pretty swell
<dw1>	i hate design
<gamma>	In fact, the only time I have ever pirated games was to play the first hour and see if I wanted it enough to buy it. If I did like it, I bought it. If not, I deleted it.

<sunstar>	hmm... not allowed to talk in ##news anymore
<Sabotender>	why not?
<sunstar>	guess somebody ruined it
<gamma>	boz: Someone else was talking about piracy.
<boz>	sunstar: you dont have to pay for mods. valve tried it for one day and with one game only; then abandoned it
<hubik>	pirate days :)
<sunstar>	nintendo is making games for cellphone now
<hubik>	haul that silver ;)
<boz>	sunstar: they have to; they're out of the home console business soon
<sunstar>	well you do in the console world

<boz>	they'll go the way of sega
<boz>	how the mighty have fallen
<sunstar>	god damn microsoft
<sunstar>	ruined gaming
<gamma>	boz: They didn't even charge for a day, and it wasn't Valve that tried it.
<hubik>	capitalists ruined gaming?
<lala>	I'm back.
<boz>	gamma: steam = valve
<gamma>	You should actually know what you're talking about before you speak.
<gamma>	boz: Bethesda were the ones that wanted customers to pay for mods, not Valve.
*	boz thwacks gamma
<boz>	gamma: facilitated by valve
<boz>	via steam
<gamma>	So? That's because Valve works with publishers and doesn't tell them "You can't do this."
<hubik>	no-one cares what old folks think about gaming anyway
<Sabotender>	get it? steam and valve?
<gamma>	It was still entirely Bethesda that wanted to do it. Gabe Newell had an AMA recently where someone asked him about it, and he said that he had warned Bethesda that the community wouldn't want it, and that he said they shouldn't do it, but they wanted to anyway.
<hubik>	it's open season on 2-year olds
<lala>	Steam and valves and ducts and ventilators.
<hubik>	catch 'em while they're fresh
<boz>	gamma: and abided nonetheless. it's their platform, not bethesda's. it took two
<lala>	Mad men.
<sunstar>	valve sux
<sunstar>	everything sux
<gamma>	Ok, I think you're purposely missing the point here, so I'm going to stop now.
<boz>	they could have a policy out of their ass that said "sorry bethesda it's against the updated policies we sent u in the mail"
<boz>	"if you dont like it create your own platform"
<boz>	boom

<Lanceylot>	I can't chat in ##chat? sounds quite arbitrary
<checkmatein1>	Lanceylot: if you say anything basically you get kicked lol
<Lanceylot>	checkmatein1: thats odd
<AppAraat>	hexhaxtron: I think I've met the devil some time in my life because I have all the resources I need to learn all the stuff that I need, but nowhere near the time to learn them.
<Lanceylot>	Sooooooo how is everyone?
<AppAraat>	Lanceylot: busy
<Lanceylot>	AppAraat: Same here xD ive got 2 more weeks of classes then finals, then its off to the Navy Recruiter
<AppAraat>	Lanceylot: so, you think you're good in following orders eh? :p
<AppAraat>	DROP AND GIVE ME 80
<Lanceylot>	AppAraat: I'd hope so, but if I well on my ASVAB I could possibly get E-3 or E-4
<lala>	E5
<AppAraat>	Lanceylot: no clue on what that means, but are you willing to kill on order?
<sud0>	wb, lala
<Lanceylot>	lala: Not bad, if that is your rank...
<lala>	Lanceylot: It's not.
<lala>	I just said it for no reason.
<sud0>	mine is E6
<sud0>	deal with it
<Lanceylot>	E-1 to E-2 is basically the grunts, the potato peelers etc.
<lala>	Lanceylot: Are you talking about army? Or military?
<lala>	Or neither?
<Lanceylot>	lala: Navy
<lala>	Lanceylot: Oh. Okay.
<Lanceylot>	lala: Mhm
<lala>	I don't think I'm hard-core enough for that stuff.
<Lanceylot>	It's not that bad, and hopefullly i'll get into Cyber
<lala>	Lanceylot: Cyber what?
<lala>	Can you explain. I'm new.
<lala>	Lanceylot: What does that mean?
<sud0>	I am not new and I am lost
<AppAraat>	cybering, he wants to cyber with those hot marine buffs
<sud0>	he may be on drugs
<y0wza>	ima ef5 ima tear u all up
<y0wza>	whrrrrr
<sud0>	u wont do sheit m8 yohnnyjoe
<sud0>	y0wza:
<sud0>	oh dear
<y0wza>	o shit
<Lanceylot>	lala: cyber - computer security, intelligence, communications, etc
<AppAraat>	Lanceylot: what if instead you're placed as IED recon team?
<y0wza>	lmao
<y0wza>	awe
<Lanceylot>	AppAraat: I doubt it
<sud0>	would you guys date a grill who used to be a man but somehow she got some surgeries to FULLY be a man, with ALL that it means
<AppAraat>	Lanceylot: so there's no chance?
<Lanceylot>	AppAraat: Well considering I have yet to talk to a recruiter, I can't answer that  honestly.
*	CuriosTiger won't kill on command for any country.
<CuriosTiger>	I don't care how much you cloak it in "honor" and "service" and "patriotism".
<y0wza>	See what America’s Navy stands for – and what you could be part of.
<y0wza>	Whoever we are, whatever we do, wherever we serve, as Sailors we are always there for our country. Get to know more about our mission and our people, the places we serve and the equipment we use, the news we make and the history we’ve made.
<lala>	What are you guys talking about?
<sud0>	amen
<y0wza>	ovens
<checkmatein1>	lala: NEK
<sud0>	but what if bush did 9/11
<sud0>	mfw
*	CuriosTiger has a few friends who found themselves in Iraq after they enlisted in peacetime for scholarships and such
<CuriosTiger>	(e.g. ROTC programs)
<CuriosTiger>	funny how fast "peacetime" can change.
<y0wza>	when did they enlist
<y0wza>	estimate?
<y0wza>	like right in hs then boom
<y0wza>	iraq
<lala>	Uh...
<lala>	Well I'm not too knowledgeable on this topic.
<y0wza>	me neither
<y0wza>	but this is the conversation
<lala>	y0wza: You don't seem to be knowledgeable on anything. But you're still  funny.
<sud0>	its funny cause noone is forcing them to join, but once they do they be bitching about it
<sud0>	or posting pics of themselves to get attention
<lala>	That's right. No one told you to join.
<sud0>	look at me I am a sad soldier fighting for "your freedom", love me pls amirite
<CuriosTiger>	y0wza: 1996-2001 (in other words, just before 9/11)
<y0wza>	damn man
<CuriosTiger>	y0wza: I was in college during those years, and most of the people I'm referring to were in the ROTC program at the same university.
<y0wza>	ah
<CuriosTiger>	lala: actually, military recruiters tell high school students to join all the time.
<CuriosTiger>	They go on tours to high schools all over the country, glorifying the military while leaving out the less palatable parts.
<y0wza>	dont forget sign on bonus
<lala>	CuriosTiger: But they have a choice.
<sud0>	yeah and the week mind fall for it
<y0wza>	of ?? 10 grand??
<CuriosTiger>	That may not be "forcing" anyone to join, but it sure heavily encourages it among impressionable, young people.
<sud0>	young and week people
<checkmatein1>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=78&v=_-8IufkbuD0
<CuriosTiger>	lala: They do have a choice, yes. But they get one-sided information (one might even say propaganda), and if it were up to me, military recruiters wouldn't be allowed to talk to anyone under age 18 without parents present.
<lala>	CuriosTiger: Oh. I see.
<Audioburn>	anyone here live in dc?
<lala>	CuriosTiger: Can they leave?
<CuriosTiger>	lala: Don't know. You generally can't leave the classroom in the US without permission from the teacher, but I don't know if different rules apply to these military presentations.
<sud0>	lmao so now its military fault, washing young students brains
<sud0>	always blaming someone else
<sud0>	thats the american way, gentlemans
<lala>	CuriosTiger: They should have the right to leave.
<AppAraat>	but simply imagine the concept itself, some higher-up that you probably have never seen in your entire life, let alone have met him, tells you to bomb some place you have probably never heard of let alone have visited and got to know the people.
<AppAraat>	it's sounds so strange if you think about it
<lala>	AppAraat: You're right. It's like a machine.
<sud0>	its a bait for week minded
<sud0>	come one u're friggin eighteen years old
<sud0>	you're not a kid
<AppAraat>	it's mainly a bait for those who are looking for a bit of discipline in their life, want to learn how to defend themselves, learn from the more skillful and become a 'man'. I can definitely understand those feelings, especially if you're 'young'. But damn, there's hell of a lot better alternatives than essentially blindly killing people.
<lala>	You're right.
<hmir>	omg you guyse
<sud0>	all what you said is just trying to hide that main fact: you will kill people
<lala>	But then again... I'm not a man, nor do I have a need of killing people.
<hmir>	you will love this song
<lala>	Hi hmir!
<sud0>	hmir: hey baby
<hmir>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCIxUfCv0Qk
<hmir>	Don't hay baby me!
<sud0>	hay baby me
<lala>	hmir: Didn't you show us that yesterday?
<lala>	I don't really like that song.
<hubik>	is it the piratez?
<hmir>	What?!
<hmir>	You don't like it?!?!?!?! =(
<Audioburn>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFLONGA-wuM
<lala>	No!
<lala>	I like softer music.

<sunstar>	bazhang, well if you are, and some one comits suicide, these irc logs hold up in court and a family member can bring you to civil court and claim your financially liable
<hubik>	are you sure sunstar ? in the uk i think you have to provide equipment or assistance to be prosecuted
<sunstar>	this is america. its all about how well off you are and how well your lawyer can BS.  cuz when it comes to a jury, anything is possible
<hubik>	oh i forgot
<ryan_46>	Even if you were right sunstar that would be rediculous I think.
<hubik>	so even if you aren't guilty of a crime they can euphemism your derriere etc.
<hubik>	i don't think either person is a yankee in this case anyway
<klixa>	damn i wish they looked this nice when i took math http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/27/ti-84-plus-ce-graphing-calculator/

<bazhang>	that was random
<dTal>	yeah what did I just walk into
<bazhang>	no idea
<dTal>	well
<ryaxnb>	oh, wrong chat
<dTal>	how do you do
<ryaxnb>	i was directing this at kevin in some other channel
<bazhang>	waaaaay wrong chat
<ryaxnb>	it's not a brony chat, its a chat with a guy who is a de lancie fan
<ryaxnb>	anyway
*	hubik whinnies
<bazhang>	overshare
<bazhang>	or should that be overneigh
<dTal>	all I know about De Lancie is that all his appearances are brony-related
<hubik>	hey that's all i know about him too
<bazhang>	never heard of them, hope that never changes
<hubik>	..scrub my skin with women
<klixa>	theres a new show premiering tonight called Wayward Pines...I plan to watch it...anyone else?

<dTal>	please direct all random remarks to #random
<klixa>	bazhang: spupposed to be ep 1, tho ep 1 has been available to pirate for a week
<ryaxnb>	De lancie played Q in Star Trek
<klixa>	but i wanted to wait for it to air
<bazhang>	its very good klixa
<hubik>	cat -| wtf
<klixa>	bazhang: it looks good...im looking forward to it
<dTal>	I thought Q was in James Bond
<bazhang>	very high production values, good choice of cast, script etc
<klixa>	i was sad last month, cause i thought it premiered last month and i had it on FOX, etc...then i realised i got the month wrong, lol
<bazhang>	heh
<bazhang>	qin bond  is quartermaster
<bazhang>	q in star trek is some otherworldly jokester
<georgij>	I am increadibly bored, I just want to crawl down a hole and die.
<ryaxnb>	bazhang: he plays basically the same character in ponies, called Discord.
<bazhang>	ryaxnb, mlp?
<ryaxnb>	yeah
<ryaxnb>	demigod-powered jokester style dude
<bazhang>	that is the sum total of knowledge of mlp, thanks for completing it
<hubik>	wow pony star trek crossover
<bazhang>	scary
<hubik>	those uniforms were like kinky for repressed people anyway
<bazhang>	if disney owned mlp, he could be in star wars new movie as well
<hubik>	in uk we have a program where you watch other people watching telly
<hubik>	so my satire bone is kinda broken
<bazhang>	monty python would roll in their graves if they were dead
<hubik>	i'm sure some are
<hubik>	i think they're already a bit miffed about how kids recite their stuff,
<hubik>	when it was supposed to be new and surprising
<bazhang>	graham chapman is
<bazhang>	the rest still live
<hubik>	good going, weren't they all doctors really or something?
<bazhang>	chapman was iirc
<hubik>	last thing i saw was The Zero Theorem
<hubik>	that was gilliam, right?
<bazhang>	that was terrible
<bazhang>	yeah
<hubik>	why terribel?
<bazhang>	huge letdown from the guy who made brazil
*	hubik shrugs
<hubik>	sure brazil is huge, much better than 1984
<hubik>	zero charmed me but i don't see many films so
<bazhang>	12 monkeys was another great one
<hubik>	yessss
<hubik>	also terrible tho :p
<FreezingCold>	Chappie is so pretty cringey
<diogenese>	cringey?
<FreezingCold>	also, Die Antwoord's south african sounds so fake.
<FreezingCold>	diogenese: like, cringe worthy
<jookiyaya>	if you rather have 100 dollar gift card or subway restaurant or  tim hortons ? which one you rather have?
<diogenese>	ah, ty
<bazhang>	I thought it funny
<diogenese>	It was worth watching (for me anyway).
<hubik>	waht, wihch?
<FreezingCold>	bazhang: I don't think they were going for funny.
<diogenese>	chappy
<FreezingCold>	also, why on earth are they using Windows' terminal?
<diogenese>	There's been a lot of movies about AI lately. Popular subject.
<FreezingCold>	diogenese: it's just so fucking stupid.
<FreezingCold>	The media is being retarded about AI.
<FreezingCold>	AI isn't going to accidentally happen or even if you work hard at it.
<FreezingCold>	it's like saying you're worried you'll get too muscular if you go to the gym every so often.
<bazhang>	you're an expert at ai
<bazhang>	duly noted
<hubik>	is there a filming of the veldt by ray bradbury?
<FreezingCold>	I'm pretty sure Die Antwoord is doing the "thug" south african accent :p
<FreezingCold>	bazhang: I'm not an expert at it, but it's pretty obvious that passing the turing test doesn't mean we have "true" AI.
<hubik>	1950 ffs
<bazhang>	since no one voiced that opinion, nice straw you have there
<hubik>	yup i forgot about the illustrated man,
<FreezingCold>	bazhang: we're trying to copy biology with software lol, the amount of overhead is insane.
<FreezingCold>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenWorm
<hubik>	brian aldiss is another very old author with lots of interesting short stories
<Froolap>	Larry Niven   All The Myrid Ways      great read
<bazhang>	greg bear is pretty good imo
<bazhang>	especially 'moving mars'

<grayC>	lol
<grayC>	im 3k off buying that tri
<DarkElement>	Hey does anyone here have a log for the programming channels from the past year or so?
<grayC>	not sure about the motor tho :\
<flipapy>	so nice http://imgur.com/gallery/H0LJY64
<Equinoxdawg>	DarkElement: "programming channels" isn't very specific.
<DarkElement>	##programming, #html, #javascript, #python, ##linux,
<DarkElement>	any of those are fine
<flipapy>	grayC, you call it a tri? what is that? the katamaran style liveaboard? its a nice boat?
<grayC>	trimaran has 3 hulls
<grayC>	single hull yachts are shit to live aboard
<flipapy>	http://imgur.com/gallery/IbY4TCv
<grayC>	the pontoons act as stabalisers, even sailing along its much nicer than a single hull
<flipapy>	hey do trimara, how much for a 35 person?
<flipapy>	3-5
<grayC>	well trimarans are expensive
<Audioburn>	head ass
<flipapy>	and it take shallow waters well no? about 12 feet no issues?
<grayC>	for a family voat you prolly want a 42;
<grayC>	42foot
<grayC>	mine is a 30
<flipapy>	i need to pilot it myself
<grayC>	you cant live 3 people on a 12 fooot boat
<flipapy>	ugh, not fun dude
<grayC>	why dont you just make a raft out of old soda bottles and discarded net
<grayC>	discarded nylon net is everywhere, as are soda bottles
<grayC>	this one guy  made his own island out of that^
<grayC>	planted trees on it and everything
<flipapy>	grayC, i like space and solidity of living, i dont like the idea of being homeless
<grayC>	i think you better stay home
<diogenese>	like a waterworld atoll
<grayC>	yes diogenese
<flipapy>	im getting some property and a MH and then back and forth daily to the dock where i have a vessel floating for about 100/mo
<grayC>	i used to dream about rafting up old container ships and making a waterworld
<grayC>	but the seawont let you
<flipapy>	the sea?
<grayC>	they would just tip over
<grayC>	yes
<flipapy>	oh, the trash house
<diogenese>	It's kinda sad to thing you could be a castaway on a deserted island and save yourself by making a boat out of the trash that washes ashore.
<flipapy>	http://imgur.com/gallery/6i86bOt  i wonder how cool these guys would be to have in a terraroum
<diogenese>	*think.
<grayC>	if you are going in open sea/ocean..the best thing is a single  yacht that can flip
<flipapy>	you mean it is set to roll, not capsising tragedies
<grayC>	my friend made it from NZ to australia in an 18 foot single hull
<grayC>	yea he flipped it over 3 times on the trip
<grayC>	they right themselves
<flipapy>	yeah thats cool
<grayC>	he didnt even have lights or nsat nav, nothing
<grayC>	found out his girl was cheating on hi with the guy who owned half the boat with him
<grayC>	so he just took orf :)
*	TheMesquito is now known as SillyMesquito
<flipapy>	sounds like it wasnt really 'his' girl
*	SillyMesquito is now known as TheMesquito

<Audioburn>	dude

<grayC>	except the elite rich yea
<Audioburn>	Yea
<Audioburn>	In nyc all I see is 90% of people frowning
<coldsparrow>	i gotta thing it
<Audioburn>	well not frowning but
<diogenese>	not smiling
<Audioburn>	they aren't giddy
<Audioburn>	yea but i mean they dont have to be smiling to be generally content
<grayC>	it is interesting to note the resting expression on the faces of people you see out and about isnt it
<grayC>	here they all look full of food and bored
<Audioburn>	yea
<Estr>	bloody hell
<Audioburn>	heh
<grayC>	so much obesity
<Estr>	Make a good drawing -> ruin everything with one little detail
<Estr>	-> Throw drawing in basket
<grayC>	we dont shop on pension day because you cant get around them in the supermarket aisles
<Estr>	-> Start on something new because I got tired of the idea
<Audioburn>	-> realize there is no food
<Lorax>	that's what erasers were invented for
<Audioburn>	-> eat drawing
<grayC>	i dont think i saw anyone yesterday who wasnt overweight
<Audioburn>	grayC, damn lol, where do you live?
<Estr>	Erasing isn't always an option
<Audioburn>	Arizona?
<grayC>	central australia
<Audioburn>	ohh
<Estr>	It could be to hard, it might smudge everything, blur it up, the detail is to tiny or too close
<Audioburn>	I didn't know Australia had that problem like the US does
<diogenese>	I used to live in west australia. Exmouth.

<artwoodwork>	2 hour nap ensued
<Estr>	That doesn't sound like very good parenting to me
<grayC>	it does to me
<artwoodwork>	probably why you're not a parent
<Estr>	The reason I'm not a parent is because I'm 16

<basuotoko>	my original plan was 20Mbit down, 1Mbit up.  from 2011 years.
<artwoodwork>	why didn't you lock your name down?
<Estr>	I find it funny how people start using my age as an insult, but usually the people who do that is way younger mentally than I am
<basuotoko>	Then, from the end of 2014, they upgraded to 50Mibt down, 2Mbit up, for free.
<crymore>	u r funny cause u r age is funneh, Estr
<crymore>	am i right?
<grayC>	haha yea crymore
<artwoodwork>	yes the world loves teenagers because they know more than adults
<basuotoko>	Now, the Prime Minister of China says the internet in china is so slow, while so expensive
<grayC>	being 16 makes you a target for anyone
<basuotoko>	now they are upgrading again. haha
<grayC>	everyone hates 16 year olds
<crymore>	teenagers know more because u think u know more, no?
<Lorax>	the internet in china is slow because it's 99% botnet traffic
<Estr>	Does that mean every 16 year olds is the same?
<Estr>	Is every black person a criminal?
<crymore>	i loved being 16 mostly
<Estr>	Does every mexican love tacos?
<grayC>	when my son was 16, riding his bike home from school, some old guy shookhis fist and yelled fuck you
<crymore>	but uhmm im a very very strange person
<artwoodwork>	you're going to be embarrased by your internet persona when you're older estr
<artwoodwork>	we all were
<penguin1263>	OMFG ITS A BITCHY TRAMPOLINE!!!@#
<crymore>	he could he was 16 and so attack before he got attacked

<crymore>	dude, i should be dancing right nowww
<artwoodwork>	really? you know what you'll think about yourself when you're 30?
<grayC>	well i was already married [defacto]and owned a house when i was 16
<grayC>	had a horse too
<crymore>	fkk my incapability of knowing places to dance in
<grayC>	actually the horse came with the house we bought
<basuotoko>	Lorax, their offical site, china telecom in Sichuan. i am going to order that 169 yuan for 100Mbit. had an appointment, they will send guys to my house this noon. few hours later my time.
<Estr>	No, I'll change, obviously
<basuotoko>	Lorax, actually this time the upload is upgraded to 10Mbit which is attraced me.
<artwoodwork>	at noon not this noon
<basuotoko>	and i am expecting their 1Gbit FTTH.
<Estr>	But I know that I wont be embarrased of myself, don't see why I would
<grayC>	i paid for the house but i couldnt be on the contract because i was only 16
<basuotoko>	Lorax,  $27 a month to use their FTTH, 100Mbit downrate, 10Mit uprate. now.
<grayC>	but my "husband" died when i was 18 and left it to me
<grayC>	i cant help it if im lucky
<Estr>	grayC, condolences
<grayC>	thank you
<basuotoko>	Lorax, what is botnet traffic?
<basuotoko>	you mean garbage messages something?
<grayC>	all the Ddos from china basuotoko
<grayC>	have you seen that live map? its cray cray
<basuotoko>	hmm
<Lorax>	most of the outgoing traffic from China is from bots running on insecure unlicenced windows systems
<artwoodwork>	people hate teenagers because they are children who think they are adults
<basuotoko>	well, i am not sure what you are saying... grayC but.... like right now i do a speedtest from their official site, i am using 57Mbit down, but actually i get like 30Mbit actual speed.
<Lorax>	quite seriously, much of the world is invisible to china because their traffic is voided by ASN
<basuotoko>	but in the night or other time, i get fully 50+Mbit.
<artwoodwork>	no job, no bills, but they know better because they read tumblr
<grayC>	http://www.mapworldmap.info/ddos.htm
<basuotoko>	Lorax, does that mean there are many chinese servers have virus?
<basuotoko>	and very strange is, the speedtest.net always says: You need flash installed
<basuotoko>	but i do have flash installed. weird.
<grayC>	i cant find the one i like the best, it is more colorful http://www.digitalattackmap.com/

<basuotoko>	chrome maybe is strong. i will try. thanks
<grayC>	if on windows you can use SrWare Iron instead of google chrome
<grayC>	it is the same but without the trackers and spyware
<Estr>	I feel like arguing against that, but I feel like I'm gonna characterize myself too much
<artwoodwork>	you already have
<basuotoko>	artwoodwork, ...
<artwoodwork>	moving on
<basuotoko>	artwoodwork,  i am an adult in china but i am also being a slave myself.
<Lorax>	did everyone see that great sports event when everyone sported their sporting sport sports?
<grayC>	yea go sports!
<basuotoko>	artwoodwork, in a matter...that i work a very long time but get little pay.
<basuotoko>	artwoodwork, i drive a bus in here.
<basuotoko>	artwoodwork, i work for 24 days a month , usually.
<artwoodwork>	ok so you admit to being a slave
<artwoodwork>	how does that help the argument that you are not a slave?
<SailorHaumea>	evening
*	YonicWitch_ is now known as CosmicWitch
<basuotoko>	artwoodwork, in each day, work from 6:30am to 7:00pm, or from 6:30am to 9:00pm.
<grayC>	well i would like to have a couple of slaves
<artwoodwork>	I'm missing your angle here basuotoko
<basuotoko>	artwoodwork, pay is like $700 a month after tax and insuranace.
<basuotoko>	artwoodwork, but that is china, this is the reality.
<artwoodwork>	well you're proving my point
<basuotoko>	artwoodwork, in a small city in sichuan province over here.
<artwoodwork>	thank you
<basuotoko>	artwoodwork, but.... i do not get what you say....slaves for those chinese teenagers?
<basuotoko>	i mean, in a developing country, that is very common.
<artwoodwork>	most countries aren't communist and most people don't have to do that
<artwoodwork>	in the whole world
<basuotoko>	hmmm
<Estr>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjNTu8jdukA
<artwoodwork>	i'm sorry for your situation
<basuotoko>	...
<artwoodwork>	but i have an argument on the internet
<basuotoko>	what's the topic?
<artwoodwork>	and the fact you have irc is sort of weird in the context
<basuotoko>	we have yahoo also
<artwoodwork>	"Here is your computer with IRC, slave!"
<basuotoko>	irc and yahoo, which are just the tools. to communicate with.
<basuotoko>	and for some reason, yes, youtube is banned which i hate.
<artwoodwork>	make sure to install windows updates
<basuotoko>	facebook and so on....
<Romance>	dont limit yourself, use whatever you want. i use all tools
<basuotoko>	yeah, irc is neat
<artwoodwork>	so it's what... 8am in China right now?
<basuotoko>	simple and useful
<crymore>	use all the fools u can get ur hands on
<basuotoko>	but here, most of people use QQ.
<basuotoko>	QQ is like a kind of instant messager
<penguin1263>	so ok then https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3mXfHS-6k8
<basuotoko>	but it has tons of features. very rich features in it.
<Lorax>	it's also state sponsored spyware
<penguin1263>	isnt QQ that adorable little penguin
<Romance>	i have facebook, twitter, instagram, youtube, gmail, yahoo email, hotmail, reddit, xvideos, and some articles opened on my chrome and firefox
<Romance>	right now
<penguin1263>	xvideos?
<basuotoko>	it can have groups in chat, support videos, picture sharing and so on. much of features you can image.
<artwoodwork>	you got myspace?
<Romance>	no myspace
<artwoodwork>	you're missing out
<grayC>	you can get youtube by proxy basuotoko ?
<basuotoko>	penguin1263, not sure..but...QQ is not just a single product
<DoverMo>	yoohoo
<grayC>	or use tor
<basuotoko>	QQ is made from a gaint company in china. called Tengxun.
<basuotoko>	grayC, yes. with VPN.
<basuotoko>	They refuse youtube, maybe they want to defend with it
<basuotoko>	well, they are building the chinese youtube, Youku.com, tudou.com
<basuotoko>	the chinese video sharing webs.

<FreezingCold>	hmir: "Under Islamic law, a killer can avoid death sentence and walk free if pardoned by the victim’s relatives in return for bloody money."
<hmir>	Plenty of loopholes int he legal system for rich people to get away with mruder.
<FreezingCold>	hmir: this isn't even a loophole
<FreezingCold>	it's totally acceptable apparently.
<hmir>	Yeah, that's a 6 century law.

<Fowler>	honey: http://how-old.net/#results
<Fowler>	The beard makes me look sincere?

<lala>	Lol. I know a person who had a similar beard.
<Fowler>	That website guesses 25
<honey>	LMAO it told me i'm 32.
<Fowler>	Which is pretty close
<Fowler>	honey: With my beard it says 38 lol
<honey>	i'm 52.
<honey>	o.O
<gamma>	It guessed that I was 31 from a picture of me at 18
<honey>	lol
<gamma>	I definitely did not look 31
<gamma>	I barely looked 18 T_T
<honey>	not at 18 i bet

<lala>	It's a fake sad. You said you're not sad.
<lala>	So it's not genuine.
<treefiddy_>	maybe it's a past pic
<lala>	treefiddy_: Good point.
<treefiddy_>	i have my moments sometims
<Fowler>	lol
<Fowler>	It's such a funny face
<treefiddy_>	and then i cant spell
<Fowler>	My forehead looks tiny in this photo
<Fowler>	That's why I'm sad
<Fowler>	http://i.imgur.com/EkUT9VF.jpg
<lala>	treefiddy_: It's okay. You tried.
<honey>	he's a vowel dropper
<honey>	lol
<lala>	That's not sad!
<Fowler>	Yes it is lol
<Fowler>	I remember my dog dying bro
<lala>	You have a smirk on your face.
<Fowler>	That was my face except I had tears drippin' from muh eyes
<treefiddy_>	it's this low profile keyboard i swear
<Fowler>	lala: Naw, that's not a smirk
<Fowler>	You suck at gauging emotions
<honey>	mine is my keyboard at times.
<Adie>	hi
<lala>	Lol.
<honey>	the new one does not respond until full boot which sucks.
<potaz>	BOH!
<Fowler>	lala: I think it's because I took the photo at a weird angle, same reason my forehead looks small
<potaz>	sup modda fooookies
<potaz>	mm, hi
<lala>	Oh.
<Fowler>	But it's the eyebrows
<lala>	Maybe you do look sad.
<Fowler>	If I'm sad muh eyebrows look like that
<lala>	Awe man. I feel sad now.
<Fowler>	lolol
<treefiddy_>	empathy
<potaz>	my asshole has a unibrow
<lala>	Thanks a lot Fowler.
<Adie>	guys I got a great idea!
<Adie>	What if IRC could use more than just the 16 mIRC colour codes, and could instead use hex codes
<Adie>	:D
*	Froolap cries for b.b. king
<Fowler>	Alright, lala
<Fowler>	I have another one for you
<Mr-Potter>	I think it can!
<Mr-Potter>	:D
<Mr-Potter>	but you need a different client
<lala>	Adie: Hex colors?
<Adie>	yah
<Adie>	hex hex hex
<treefiddy_>	like an evil magic spell
<lala>	Adie: Font colors?
<treefiddy_>	so greens
<mkaminsky11>	that would be cool
<treefiddy_>	and blacks
<Fowler>	lala: http://i.imgur.com/7bUcarC.jpg
<Adie>	lala, sure
<Fowler>	There
<treefiddy_>	and reds
<mkaminsky11>	Fowler: wft?
<treefiddy_>	what other colors are evil?
<Fowler>	lol
<Fowler>	mkaminsky11: Totally genuine happy face lol
<Fowler>	100%
<lala>	Fowler: Woah that scared me.
<mkaminsky11>	those eyes...boring into my soul
<Fowler>	lala told me to smile!
<Fowler>	That's what my smile looks like!
<Froolap>	how boring, very droll
<lala>	LOL!
<Fowler>	Don't be mean!
*	mkaminsky11 is mean
<Froolap>	i was being silly
<Fowler>	Froolap: Droll means amusing, I wasn't talking about you

<lala>	You look like you're going to eat the camera.
<princefakhan_>	lala: haha.
<treefiddy_>	he's doing a  montage, the next pic will be from the inside
<lala>	I can imagine saliva coming out.
<princefakhan_>	ewww

<Fowler>	lol
<Fowler>	Bazhang defending his actions before anyone even comments on them
<treefiddy_>	yes princefakhan_
*	ChanServ gives channel operator status to bazhang
*	ChanServ removes channel operator status from bazhang
<princefakhan_>	bazhang: I believe that link should be hangin on every chan topic
<bazhang>	ban evasion happen beyond time
<princefakhan_>	treefiddy_: I wanted to say. that is one hell of a smile
<Fowler>	I don't understand why people feel the need to evade bans
<Fowler>	It's not like there aren't a million other channels
<bazhang>	but I can adjust the meaning of that link for Fowler s sake if need be
<princefakhan_>	:P
<treefiddy_>	thanks
<princefakhan_>	:)
<Fowler>	bazhang: What? I agree with the point of that comic 100%
<Fowler>	It annoys me when people get angry about moderator decisions
<Fowler>	And cry about free speech
<bazhang>	we are free not to listen to garbage like that gorben was spouting
<Fowler>	Same thing when people complain about being barred from restaurants for what they say
<Fowler>	If you aren't in public you don't get to say whatever you want
<mkaminsky11>	well, you do...and other people get to tell you to shut up
<Fowler>	mkaminsky11: If you're in someone else's private residence or business they can kick you out for any reason
<Fowler>	You have to follow their rules
<treefiddy_>	yeah, the forum. people think they can voice anything they want in any forum. when they set the forum up, it's their turn.
<Fowler>	Free speech doesn't apply, they can do more than tell you to shut up
<Fowler>	They can tell you to gtfo and if you don't they get to call the police and have you physically removed
<mkaminsky11>	Fowler: yes, but you get at least one chance to say whatever you want
<mkaminsky11>	freedom of speech
<mkaminsky11>	!
<Fowler>	lol
<Fowler>	I guess that's true
<bazhang>	freedom of kamikaze more like
<treefiddy_>	haha
<hubik>	aherm
<lala>	Hi hubik.
<hubik>	ook
<lala>	Welcome back.
*	hmir flies a plane into treefiddy_
<hubik>	i think people running a business have a responsibility to be fair
*	treefiddy_ is detonated from the inside by pre-planted explosives.
<hmir>	I think people running a business have a responsiblity to their shareholders.
<bazhang>	that and two bits, and you got some coffee
<treefiddy_>	stakeholders
<lala>	It would be "onto treefiddy_" unless you're saying treefiddy_ is larger than a plans, which is insulting!
<treefiddy_>	im as big as a tower lala
<hmir>	Not just stakeholders, but shareholders.
<treefiddy_>	hows that for megalomania
<treefiddy_>	im going to challenge kanye for biggest ego
<treefiddy_>	im unstoppabru
<princefakhan_>	lol!
<bazhang>	not a carrier at least
<treefiddy_>	but ironicly
<hubik>	i don't know what you mean hmir
<treefiddy_>	so it's funny
<hmir>	I thought it was pretty clear what I meant.
<hubik>	businesses have to obey the law, their shareholders don't benefit if they're prosecuted
<treefiddy_>	shareholders have a stake in the company
<bazhang>	in a fantasy world
<bazhang>	sure
<Fowler>	It's perfectly lawful to kick someone out of your place of business because of what they say
<treefiddy_>	but there are other stakeholders that aren't necessarily shareholders
<treefiddy_>	make your venn diagram
<treefiddy_>	or dont i dont care
<hmir>	But you do!
<hubik>	fowler you said they could kick you out for any reason,
<lala>	treefiddy_: Is Venn a name?
<Fowler>	hubik: They can
<hmir>	You care deeply.
<hubik>	no
<Fowler>	Yes
<hubik>	no
<hmir>	Messi scored!!!
<bazhang>	peter venn, yes
<Fowler>	hubik: lolyes
<hubik>	nananananana
<treefiddy_>	lala it's a logic tool
<treefiddy_>	i think it is named after the guy who invented it
<lala>	That answers the question. Thanks.
<Fowler>	hubik: OK, as long as it isn't because of their skin color or nationality or something. But as far as kicking people out for what they say, that isn't protected
<Fowler>	I think they can even legally refuse service to gay people as far as federal law is concerned
<hubik>	hmm,
<hmir>	treefiddy_; so the venn diagram would be a smaller circle inside a larger circle.
<Fowler>	Some states and cities have passed stuff to protect against discrimination against gay people but I don't think anything federal yet
<Fowler>	But I'm not super up to date
<treefiddy_>	i cant visualize it right. you'd almost have to do 2 different ones? cause one shows that all shareholders are stakeholders. and then another to show that not all stakeholders are shareholders.
<treefiddy_>	who knows
<hubik>	hubik ⊂ nicks ?
<hubik>	hmm,

<duckgoose>	if we keep on soon we'll be yelled at to go to ##politics so...
<hmir>	Let's go there and talk!
<princefakhan>	mkaminsky11: u r ryt. now I feel like getting a popcorn
<treefiddy_>	ok you first
<treefiddy_>	i'll brt
<duckgoose>	I went there before
<treefiddy_>	*WINK*
<duckgoose>	they don't seem very bright
<hmir>	NOU
<MooingLemur>	Hai hmir
<hmir>	i gotta brush my teef
*	hmir hugs MooingLemur
<hmir>	Then hit the sack.
<natel>	Bush did 7/11? "Your slush totals at $.89. Will that be all?"
*	MooingLemur huggles hmir 
<swift110>	lol
<hubik>	ouch, ISIS took Ramadhi
<duckgoose>	say what you will but one thing stands true
<duckgoose>	Bush can dodge a shoe.
<hmir>	I bet Bush has never been inside a 7/11 in his life.
<natel>	Lolol
<hubik>	Iraq is almost gone
<hmir>	the oil must flow!
<hubik>	nah
<peret>	hmir: Which bush?
<natel>	If the US could just harness the oil off my face we'd be set
<duckgoose>	the idea that we went to war for oil is BS
<duckgoose>	america produces more oil than it buys
<duckgoose>	why would we need to go to war over it
<natel>	We're still way too dependent on others
<natel>	We pay them with money we don't have
<cobracommand>	are there still cruises that take the same route as the titanic?
<remialc3r>	that's a really good question. It's also pretty counter productive to shut down all the coal plants like obama has been doing, when they were almost pollution free compared to the chinese ones.
<remialc3r>	counter intuitive even.
<duckgoose>	the route wasn't titanic falling
<duckgoose>	it was a shitty crew
<cobracommand>	just want to know to avoid a transatlantic cruise that goes nears icebergs like the titanic did
<remialc3r>	net result is actually more pollution not less. Aswell as less energy self dependency. An idiotic thing to do.
<natel>	"Oh fuck, an iceburg"
<hubik>	go the long way round
<natel>	"We'll be fine"
<princefakhan>	"Every time we do something you tell me America will do this and will do that . . . I want to tell you something very clear: Don't worry about American pressure on Israel. We, the Jewish people, control America, and the Americans know it." - Israeli Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon
<hubik>	going east-west is not actually the shortest route
<princefakhan>	finally found it.
<Estr>	How is working at a hotell as 16?
<Estr>	A gigantic one
<princefakhan>	if they let you.
<cobracommand>	but you still havn't answered my questions, are there cruises that travel the north atlantic near icebergs like the titanic?
<treefiddy_>	idk, google knows all
<hubik>	sometimes you can get a berth on cargo ships, i don't believe there are trans-ocean ferries
<duckgoose>	46% of Americans are non-religious
<duckgoose>	but sadly the world still thinks we're all bible thumpers
<hubik>	you're all bible thumpers :p
<remialc3r>	well you know stereotypes and all that.
<hubik>	anti-abortion nuts
<clarjon1>	duckgoose: well, many of the people in power tend to be bible thumpers, or swayed by bible thumpers.
<princefakhan>	You muricans are in debt.
*	clarjon1 looks at the creationism sneaking into public education
<hubik>	eek
<duckgoose>	we're in debt sure
<duckgoose>	however
<duckgoose>	EVERY country has debt
<princefakhan>	more than a trillion.
<princefakhan>	that is something dude.
<hubik>	you have some good pride marches, and some raging homophobes
<duckgoose>	princefakhan America has a very good credit rating
<duckgoose>	that means we're really good at paying our debts
<princefakhan>	if China suddenly asks for all the money. the american economy will cripple down.
<princefakhan>	but well they won't. because china makes a good income off the interest.
<remialc3r>	princefakhan, seems like you want the US to fail?
<princefakhan>	you pay the interest. not the debt.
<clarjon1>	duckgoose: *making minimum payment on our debts
<princefakhan>	remialc3r: I'm just sayin
<clarjon1>	If the US was great at actually paying said debts
<remialc3r>	well you're doing a little bit more than that. hehe
<clarjon1>	then they wouldn't be in as much debt
<duckgoose>	as far as China
<duckgoose>	America brought China out of the slums
<hubik>	!?
<duckgoose>	they have jobs thanks to us
<duckgoose>	recalling all their debt would not be a smart move
<hubik>	they had jobs before
<duckgoose>	they had little jobs
<duckgoose>	less pay
<duckgoose>	no apple, intel, AMD
<duckgoose>	etc etc etc
<hubik>	and the most productive agriculture in the world
<natel>	China could rek us
<cobracommand>	Is America on the way up or on the decline?
<duckgoose>	we could reck China, too
<princefakhan>	duckgoose: with what. dem missiles.
<duckgoose>	according to statistics America is ... normal
<duckgoose>	princefakhan with our money and jobs. China is becoming rich off of American money
<cobracommand>	stagnant?
<duckgoose>	we pay them to make shit for us
<remialc3r>	americans are pretty nice people but they get blamed for everything.. A LOT these days.
<hubik>	that's because they have the biggest military in the world
<hubik>	and they keep doing shit
<remialc3r>	not like the average americans are "doing shit".
<duckgoose>	China and America have a good relations going
<duckgoose>	we help each other out in different ways. it works out
<cobracommand>	economically but not militarily
<hubik>	it's a military economy
<cobracommand>	china's government still does hostile things to america
<remialc3r>	yeah, you going to blame all chinese for that?
<remialc3r>	see how that works
<cobracommand>	no they're govt
<binaryhermit>	me chinese me play joke me go peepee in your coke
<duckgoose>	America has seen a great depression before. it's a good example of what happens when we lose our money
*	binaryhermit ducks
<duckgoose>	what do we do? we pull through
<honey>	lol binaryhermit
<cobracommand>	*their
<cobracommand>	the chinese govt is a problem to their own people and to other countries
<prison_>	yo
<hubik>	yay prison_
<honey>	yo
<prison_>	whassup

<hubik>	except you and honey ;)

<hubik>	lobby!!!
<prison_>	howdy
<honey>	lol.
<honey>	i'm not american.
<zildjian>	prison_: how's your fitness stuff going
<prison_>	americans do stupid stuff
<prison_>	not good at all zildjian
<princefakhan>	lol!
<zildjian>	prison_: you gain it back?
<cobracommand>	I think the UK do stupid stuff
<prison_>	been sick and pretty much nothing solid is exiting my body
<remialc3r>	pretty sure everyone does stupid stuff.. lol
<hubik>	mmm
<duckgoose>	the world does stupid stuff
<zildjian>	prison_: drink some prune juice. THat will get you shitting quick
<remialc3r>	right
<prison_>	so i stopped with the veggies because i figured they'd make it worse
<princefakhan>	who doesn't do stupid stuff.
<duckgoose>	America put a man on the moon
<prison_>	im going too much
<duckgoose>	that aint too stupid
<prison_>	it's all liquid
<prison_>	i cant even constipate myself
<cobracommand>	europe does far more stupid stuff than the US
<prison_>	goin on like 10 days now
<hubik>	45 yrs ago duckgoose
<prison_>	plus i got post nasal drip making me feel nauseous
<flipapy>	gross, but prison_ have you tried chese and healthy yogurts?
<cobracommand>	and both do smart stuff as well
<prison_>	not food borne because no one else in the house is sick, nepehws arent sick
<prison_>	i've been eating cheese non stop
<zildjian>	prison_: I've been doing intermittent fasting and fat is melting off me.  I do 30 minutes of cardio in the morning and at night fasted.  Works very well
<duckgoose>	hubik yea now we have our eeys set on mars ;)
<duckgoose>	eyes*
<prison_>	i fast during the day pretty much, i dont eat real food til 330-4 each day
<princefakhan>	And what did the world or America achieve from putting a man on the moon.
<prison_>	and it's cheese
<cobracommand>	a lot actually
<prison_>	more funding for nasa!
<clarjon1>	princefakhan: Lots of conspiracy theorists.
<prison_>	and fodder for hollywood
<prison_>	apollo 13 anyone?
<zildjian>	prison_: eating window for me is 11am - 5pm.  I only eat a specifc amount of calories and then end up fasting for nearly 16 hours a day.  Fat just melts off
<hubik>	nasa pays off, just ask sagan
<flipapy>	yeah eating only nutritious goods, high protien low fats and decent qt of fibers with a multi vitamine and plenty of water, combined with lots of walking and aerobic atcivities will burn the fat, imo
<princefakhan>	clarjon1: that is the only thing I guess
<prison_>	i just move a lot at work to the point my feet are hurting more than ever :P
<remialc3r>	princefakhan, it got people to put things into perspective of how small we are on this little planet for one.. Which is a healthy thing. And how petty our strifes really are in many cases..
<remialc3r>	i don't think that's entirely objectionable.
<hubik>	the small blue dot
<prison_>	not to meniton i think im not absorbing nutrients, always feel starving, so im sure electrolytes are off makin me feel fatigued
<duckgoose>	princefakhan "We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things,[5] not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills"
<prison_>	im a hot mess right now
<hubik>	oosh
<cobracommand>	drugs aren't the smartest thing to do
<cobracommand>	illicit
<hubik>	who are you talking to cobracommand ?
<princefakhan>	c'mon. I'm saying that sending a man to some planet/moon is pretty pointless.
<duckgoose>	princefakhan it united the nation man
<princefakhan>	the rovers and satellites can do the useful stuff.
<prison_>	well they wanted to see if it was made of cheese
<Estr>	CAKE
<Estr>	BRB
<Estr>	ÅASIjdåpdk
<princefakhan>	lol prison_
<hubik>	there was no electronic nose in 1970
<cobracommand>	illicit drugs make you dumber, just look at people who have smoked weed for 15 yrs
<princefakhan>	it did, duckgoose.
<remialc3r>	princefakhan, you're missing the idea, i tried to explain some of it to you but if you don't see the point then you don't see the point.
<princefakhan>	if so that is great.
<remialc3r>	it's a first step to understanding the universe better.
<remialc3r>	gotta start somewhere.
<princefakhan>	so this was it. for perspective. u spend a lot of money.
<hubik>	gil scott heron was still miffed anyway
<princefakhan>	and put lifes at risk
<remialc3r>	do you think we'd be better off if we didn't?
<cobracommand>	ofcourse you can be smart and experiment with drugs, but doing drugs everyday for a long time is pretty dumb
<hubik>	why are you talking about drugs cobracommand, no-one else is
<remialc3r>	we can live in our own little bubble about how our solar system is? not go anywhere, just stay in our house. lock the doors.
<cobracommand>	because you know it's true
<princefakhan>	and thee fvcking, conspiracy theorist. they confuse the hell out.
<remialc3r>	we didn't go to the moon, and flat earth society yeah.. that's great company.
<boz>	https://imgur.com/ba5v5jp
<princefakhan>	remialc3r: its not like we don't know anything abut the universe.
<remialc3r>	princefakhan, no, but actually going to a place, is a heck of a lot more substantial.. than just talking about it and watching it from afar.
<hubik>	don't you believe that everyone benefitted from the science of the moon project princefakhan ?
<duckgoose>	apollo 11 put a man on the moon with les computing power than a smartphone of today
<duckgoose>	I think thats impressive :0
<princefakhan>	and we didn't go nowhere far than some kms from earths atmosphere in person.
<princefakhan>	err. maybe moon
<hubik>	that's a good point duckgoose, and why we couldn't send a robot
<princefakhan>	hubik: :P
<princefakhan>	we did send robots.
<princefakhan>	they are called rovers.
<hubik>	who? when?
<hubik>	we were talking about apollo, 1970
<prison_>	red rover red rover send humans on over
<prison_>	poof they were there
<prison_>	eagle done landed
<funkentelechrxp>	energize
<duckgoose>	"To date, the United States is the only country to have successfully conducted manned missions to the Moon." also this
<hubik>	when john conway challenged the maths world with the game of life and everyone was shocked when it was solved by a computer
<duckgoose>	not to gloat or anything ;)
<princefakhan>	eh. well I admit we have benefitted.
<remialc3r>	shh.. everybody knows americans can't celebrate any accomplishment they did.. they're all bad and evil..
<princefakhan>	just not a lot.
<boz>	duckgoose: it was a dick waving act aimed at the ussr though.
<boz>	nothing good came from having feet on the moon
<remialc3r>	lesigh..
<boz>	though space travel in general has produced a lot of tech that's ended up being quite useful in other industries
<treefiddy_>	we made it so we can more accurately measure the distance
<duckgoose>	boz I'm just trying to make a point that Americans can go great things too
<barfod>	boz: i think they could not properly make microchips until there were several experiments conducted in space
<treefiddy_>	and that's how they learned about the moons orbit
<treefiddy_>	and they also found high concentrations of h3 in the soil
<barfod>	i do not remember the details, but if you are interested in the history that might be worth looking into
<treefiddy_>	it could possibly be refined for fuel
<boz>	treefiddy_: and 50 years on it hasnt
<prison_>	refine humans soylent fuel
<barfod>	boz: though that still has nothing to do with the moon itself
<barfod>	prison_: !
<treefiddy_>	there are issues with going back that i dont think anyone's conquered
*	barfod is now known as dcmg
<prison_>	!
<boz>	barfod: we had microchips prior to the moon landing
<treefiddy_>	namely, there's no atmosphere, so there's no errosion
<treefiddy_>	all that dust on the moon is razor sharp
<dcmg>	boz: you may want to look into it anyway
<hubik>	they put a mirror on it :)
<diogenese>	Not cheese?
<boz>	dcmg: ok thx
<prison_>	cheesecake !
<duckgoose>	another thing is, we succeeded in going to the moon with the first attempt
<duckgoose>	the USSR killed people before they got a man in space
<dcmg>	prison_: how are you beautiful?
<prison_>	starving
<prison_>	how you doin
<dcmg>	pretty good. better now that I am talking to you
<prison_>	smooth :P
<Exagone313>	how many tabs do you have in your browser? i am sure i beat you
<prison_>	just one, netflix
<duckgoose>	we sent a total of 12 people to the moon
<duckgoose>	and we got them all home safely
<prison_>	how many returned from the moon
<prison_>	oh
<duckgoose>	I'm proud of that
<princefakhan>	Exagone313: damnit chrome
<hubik>	pride is a sin :p
<prison_>	hubris
<Exagone313>	?
<prison_>	hubrik
<dcmg>	heh
<boz>	duckgoose: why? it's not like you had a hand in it
<Exagone313>	i have 662 tabs
<hubik>	:o
<boz>	Exagone313: and hopefully a pc with 32GB ram
<dcmg>	Exagone313: jeez louise
<remialc3r>	there's a massive difference in excessive pride and appreciating that you did something good.
<princefakhan>	Exagone313: what browser are you using again.
<Exagone313>	my browser process uses 1.6 Go
<Exagone313>	GB*
<Exagone313>	but not all tabs are loaded
<Exagone313>	pale moon
<remialc3r>	excessive pride can be very harmful, appreciating that you did something well is not a bad thing.
<boz>	"a feeling or deep pleasure or satisfaction derived from one's own achievements, the achievements of those with whom one is closely associated,"
<dcmg>	like USA hometown pride?
<princefakhan>	Exagone313: I ask u again. what browser are u using.
<Exagone313>	pale moon
<duckgoose>	:P
<boz>	do not make princefakhan ask a third time
<Exagone313>	do tou want to ask me again?
<prison_>	cheesecake pride
<boz>	he is a prince!
<awkwardtechdude>	One guy said, "My computer has a trilobyte of storage." I then said, "So your hard disk is an ancient shellfish?"
<treefiddy_>	he said pale moon
<duckgoose>	I'm proud of my country for their success in going to the moon
<dcmg>	hometown proud split loaf cracked wheat white bread
<duckgoose>	if that makes me a sinner, so be it
<treefiddy_>	y u no listen
<Exagone313>	https://www.palemoon.org/
<princefakhan>	Exagone313: lol! I ask again and I don't get answered. that will ruin my repo maybe. so no. :p
<dcmg>	is that dovermo guy here much? i liked that dude
<duckgoose>	you say excessive pride is a bad thing. I think exxesive contempt is worse.
<remialc3r>	duckgoose, it doesn't. It's the excessive pride that can be harmful to others when it becomes irrational.. Being pleased that you did something well is lightyears removed from that.
<boz>	duckgoose: nobody said anything about sin. u cant feel pride in achievements of people you have no affiliation with. call it admiration instead
<dcmg>	duckgoose: nothing wrong with a little pride if it gets you out of bed in the morning ay?
<hubik>	rtfb
<boz>	can i just post this again? https://imgur.com/ba5v5jp
<dcmg>	or well, i guess one has to get up to pee anyway
<boz>	i mean i lol'd
<remialc3r>	when it's "you're beneath me cause i'm too proud to admit i make mistakes ever.. " that's the type of bad pride..
<remialc3r>	that's detrimental
<remialc3r>	the natural pride of doing something good, that just builds character and confidence and is good.
<duckgoose>	I think a big problem with America today is people with too much contempt for the government and their country
<princefakhan>	there is one based on Chrome core but with Opera aesthetics. Vivaldi.
<duckgoose>	it's bankrolled now because people allowed it to happen. they decided to stop being a part of it
<boz>	duckgoose: you know the moon landing footage was staged right? :) the flag dun waved!
<dcmg>	boz: heh
<treefiddy_>	explain the mirrors on the surface of the moon with your conspiracy theory
<boz>	nou
<treefiddy_>	did we fire them via rail cannon?
<duckgoose>	boz was debunked
<boz>	i was joking
<duckgoose>	:(
<diogenese>	Anti-gravity paint.
<hubik>	what's the fastest moving man-made object?
<treefiddy_>	oh fun
<duckgoose>	SO
<treefiddy_>	a sneeze
<boz>	hubik: the shit in the hadron collider
<duckgoose>	I bought a broken laptop off ebay for 20 bucks
<treefiddy_>	yeah particles in the LHC
<duckgoose>	popped new ram in it, fired right up
<duckgoose>	win B]
<hubik>	how are they man-made?
<boz>	duckgoose: u da baws
<boz>	hubik: they're formed when we crack shit together
<duckgoose>	I remember when they where saying the LHC was going to cause the end of the world :P
<hubik>	i thought they were part of the shit we cracked together
<hubik>	we just broke it to look inside
<remialc3r>	duckgoose, well that had a slim chance of happening, very slim but a theoretical chance of happening. But i'm fairly certain the people working on that don't have ass for brains.
<boz>	hubik: afaik new particles were formed from the impact(s) i.e the higgs boson was formed in the crucible of the impact?
<honey>	shit we cracked? lol
<boz>	i might need to read up
<hubik>	me too
<treefiddy_>	the particles arent formed, they're released from their bonds, and we try to capture that and study it
<hubik>	honey, get with the yoot
<boz>	" The Standard Model predicts that Higgs bosons could be formed in a number of ways,[88][89][90] although the probability of producing a Higgs boson in any collision is always expected to be very small—for example, only 1 Higgs boson per 10 billion collisions in the Large Hadron Collider.[Note 13"
<boz>	so ja i was right
<treefiddy_>	i disagree with that
<treefiddy_>	the particles already exist
<boz>	they were formed
<hubik>	F=ma
<treefiddy_>	they're just not observable while bonded with other particles
*	boz smacks treefiddy_
<boz>	treefiddy_: no, energy turns to mass
<boz>	because e= m
<Mr-Potter>	What can set a fire alarm off apart from a fire?
<dcmg>	well i think we can all agree that at a certian point in history "the end of the world" became a realistic possibility
<hubik>	mother in sneakers Mr-Potter
<treefiddy_>	someone pulling the handle Mr-Potter
<Mr-Potter>	lol
<boz>	the end of the world is a complete and utter inevitability man
<Mr-Potter>	no I mean a detector sorry for the vagueness
<treefiddy_>	carbon monoxide, many home detectors are combo units
<boz>	why would our planet be any different
<treefiddy_>	heat from cooking
<treefiddy_>	or something on stoves heating element
<hubik>	toast that's too toasted
<Mr-Potter>	ok
<hubik>	my head (low ceilings)
<treefiddy_>	dying battery makes it beep
<remialc3r>	the desire that it's inevitable that we fuck something up some day/to have everything come apart one day is a bit disturbing of a trait.
<boz>	cigarettes
<treefiddy_>	faulty test button
<remialc3r>	why can't it go towards better things?
<hubik>	cigarettes are actually on fire though
<remialc3r>	what's so wrong with that?
<teenspirit>	guys i have a challenge for you
<teenspirit>	name some foods that look like hair
<remialc3r>	mistakes are inevitable ofcourse, but why the insistance that everything has to "naturally" turn to shit.
<hubik>	disorder increases with time
<boz>	teenspirit: http://www.marthastewart.com/852079/kadaif
<boz>	teenspirit: it's called kadaif and it looks like hair

<treefiddy_>	oh that's a standard DNR
<dcmg>	and i miss you, prison and rich felker when i shut it down. even though you guys all hate me

<klixa-cloud>	flipapy: pregnancy can cause blood clots so better safe than sorry type thing

<duckgoose>	I'll try again to make sure
<duckgoose>	yea
<duckgoose>	or just something where it retains the information
<boz>	duckgoose: and? lubuntu is designed to run on very old machines. 1GB RAM should be doable
<klixa-cloud>	I need to do that myself got a laptop laying around with bad drive cable
<duckgoose>	boz I don't mean ram
*	AnTi_MTtr just got a new laptop
<hubik>	persistent option on a live distro is faster than full install but still keeps  changes
<duckgoose>	I'll look into that
<lala>	Greetings humble Earthlings.
<Froolap>	mumble
<lala>	I am lala. I am a creature out of this planet. I come in peace.
<hubik>	i think you're upside-down

<dcmg>	Mr-Potter: a 30-30

<Mr-Potter>	The bitch let's Jasper live at home and doesn't give a fuck about the fact he's a drug dealing thieiving bastard who belongs 6 ft under

<lala>	Mr-Potter: Threatening to use a fire extinguisher on someone.
<lala>	Mr-Potter: Pulling the fire alarm with no real threat of fire.
<Mr-Potter>	i'm worried that a fire engine might be dispatched to deal with **** all or I'll damage the call point

<dw1>	Lorax: pseudolaw vs cops is the amusement :p
<swift110>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vICX-6dMOuA
<Mr-Potter>	true it may be legal but there was no obligation in the end and even then its grounds for a complaint and thats before i get onto the psuedolegal nonsense she herself came out with that I was commiting some sorta civil offence by photographing her
<Lorax>	depending on where you live, the police can quite lawfully detain you without arrest as part of an inquiry, it's how they get away with carding
<Mr-Potter>	still shes sexy
<Mr-Potter>	i was never detained
<dw1>	it's their job to harass jackasses :p
<Mr-Potter>	but she put me under the impression i was at the very least a breach of the code of practise but whether or not its legal is another question
<Mr-Potter>	dw1: how am I a jackass
<dw1>	i assume you got up close and rudely took their pic
<Lorax>	while shouting "oink oink oink!"?
*	JuneCleaver is now known as honey
<dw1>	http://content.met.police.uk/Site/photographyadvice
<dw1>	if you knew the law you could have shut her down :p
<Mr-Potter>	dw1: No
<Mr-Potter>	yes
<dw1>	you were not obligated to provide name :)
<Mr-Potter>	i couldve and i did but i forgot it
<dw1>	'cause no crime
<dw1>	hehe
<Mr-Potter>	i provided my name understanding I wasn't obliged to but because I wanted hers in return
<dw1>	you can use the badge #
<Mr-Potter>	I OK
<Mr-Potter>	I didn't however provide my DOB or address
<ceil>	uk cops don't have name tags?
<dw1>	"If you are asked to stop and account, you are entitled to see the police officer's identification (if he or she is not in uniform) and you are entitled to get a receipt noting details of the stop."
<Lorax>	you can also say "my friends call me bruce" or whatever.
<Mr-Potter>	ceil: True
<dw1>	also they aren't required to quote exact statutes
<dw1>	i dont think
<Mr-Potter>	I never said she was I asked for it
<dw1>	yeah
<ceil>	quoting exact statutes is for angry anti-cops over here : p
<Mr-Potter>	ceil: Correct uk cops dont have name tags
<Mr-Potter>	dw1: You mean i could use the badge number to find her name
<dw1>	yeah
<dw1>	or it'll prob be on the ticket :p
<hubik>	no ticket
<dw1>	haha
<pingfloyd>	they have badge numbers don't they?
<Mr-Potter>	there was no ticket!
<pingfloyd>	she thought you were a creep and let you off with warning, get over it
<Mr-Potter>	OK thanks
<Mr-Potter>	haha
<Mr-Potter>	seriously how come you think that I managed to get away with using psedulegal tactics
<Mr-Potter>	I would get over it but it sets a worrying precident!
<pingfloyd>	I would have asked for her phone number
<Mr-Potter>	Like is everyone who photographs a cop without permission gonna get this response?
<pingfloyd>	or asked her out for dinner
<dw1>	i dont know i didnt watch it all
<dw1>	i just assumed ;P
<Mr-Potter>	pingfloyd: You wouldnt need that you could call 101 and ask for her by collar number
<Mr-Potter>	dw1: Correct i used pseudolegal tactics but please watch
<Mr-Potter>	I didnt even get a warning
<pingfloyd>	I act disappointed she didn't detain me first though
<Mr-Potter>	another officer turned up and he let me off without that
<Mr-Potter>	and not a proper officer a PCSO
<dw1>	yea well you didnt commit an offense
<pingfloyd>	so, even cops don't like paparazzi weirdos
<hubik>	she probably got quietly told off for wasting so much time
<Mr-Potter>	correct
<hubik>	pingfloyd, wtf
<Mr-Potter>	haha
<Mr-Potter>	hubik: WTF
<Mr-Potter>	Are you calling me a she or the fake cop
<lala>	Cleopatra won.
<pingfloyd>	chock it up, could've been worse, could've been Sean Penn
<hubik>	the pcso Mr-Potter
<Mr-Potter>	another reason to complain right there
<lala>	swift110: Cleopatra won.
<Mr-Potter>	oh ok thanks wasn't clear to me sorry
<Mr-Potter>	i also spoke to multiple ppl who agree with my complaint why should i
<Mr-Potter>	they alledge everytime i tried to justify myself she didnt listen i agree
<pingfloyd>	maybe she was flattered and just wanted to flirt, but then you got all armchair lawyer on her
<dw1>	you voluntarily interacted
<pingfloyd>	and it was a turn off
<dw1>	play with fire, get burned :P
<hubik>	it's a problem that she couldn't back down because of inexperience or ego
<funkentelechrxp>	play with fire, get higher
<hubik>	it's not really voluntary, dw1
<Mr-Potter>	these are my pictures https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-4mteUd8eqOs/VN464CQ22wI/AAAAAAAABsI/GhKUlXnABW4/w404-h538-no/IMG_20150213_163816.jpg https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-C1LH7PvzhB0/VN46z_MVOMI/AAAAAAAABr8/sFV9A66iuDA/w404-h538-no/IMG_20150213_163810.jpg
<Mr-Potter>	of the cop
<Mr-Potter>	pingfloyd: Fair enough
<Mr-Potter>	dw1: I didn't she went up to me and asked these questions
<Mr-Potter>	I said no she didnt leave until the other pcso turned up
<Mr-Potter>	hubik: Ego
<dw1>	so ignore her
<Mr-Potter>	dw1: You mean as in I shouldnt have said a word?
<Mr-Potter>	pingfloyd: But why would she ask these questions to flirt?
<dw1>	its an option
<Mr-Potter>	OK
<dw1>	if you just walked away she might not have followed
<swift110>	lala lol
<Mr-Potter>	dw1: Fair enough are you saying i shouldnt complain
<Mr-Potter>	i was joking earlier <Mr-Potter> Are you calling me a she or the fake cop
<honey>	maybe both
<Mr-Potter>	maybe just the PCSO
<Mr-Potter>	dw1: What if she restrained me?
<dw1>	then she got some splainin to do
<pingfloyd>	what questions?
<Mr-Potter>	yup
<Mr-Potter>	wouldve been quite nice considering her gender and size lol
<Mr-Potter>	pingfloyd: my name address and dob
<swift110>	how are you lala
<Mr-Potter>	the dob is hearsay as any self respecting lawyer would agree with now wouldnt they?
<pingfloyd>	Mr-Potter: maybe she wanted to make sure you weren't jail bait
<Mr-Potter>	fair enough
<Mr-Potter>	You mean wanted?
<hubik>	he's being facetious Mr-Potter
<Mr-Potter>	yup
<dw1>	jailbait = underage
<pingfloyd>	not necessarily
<OERIAS>	what happened to #defocus?
<Mr-Potter>	dw1: Underage for what?
<dw1>	sex
<rcmaehl>	#defocus is kill, ##chat is new defocus.
<lala>	swift110: I'm doing fantasticalistical.
<pingfloyd>	I'd have to be there to know the subtext going on
<swift110>	lala thats great
<OERIAS>	##chat
<Mr-Potter>	dw1: Why would underage for sex be relevant
<Mr-Potter>	llol
<swift110>	lala what ya up too
<dw1>	cuz maybe she liiiikes you
<lala>	OERIAS: I guess people transitioned to use ##chat. And eventually #defocus died down.
<Mr-Potter>	oh fuck
<Mr-Potter>	yes
<Mr-Potter>	literally oh fuck
<pingfloyd>	or a date
<pingfloyd>	hello

<hubik>	yup
<spiritech>	Hi, how are you this fine english evening?

<pingfloyd>	nanobots
<Mr-Potter>	pingfloyd: Also can you explain why I shouldnt make a complaint
<spiritech>	pingfloyd. that just totally reminded me about a theory i have.
<lala>	Noah. YouTube is currently blocked in China?
<FreezingCold>	DNG is a neat format.
<FreezingCold>	I never knew that so much content was cropped out of my lens by default.
<pingfloyd>	I built one in my basement at 10
<lala>	YouTube is currently blocked in China?!?!
<teenspirit>	yeah
<hubik>	 youku !
<teenspirit>	thats from The China Study
<teenspirit>	if you read the book its about how Youtube uses Cold War propaganda on China
<teenspirit>	wht most don't know is that china is also in the cold war
<teenspirit>	its china vs russia vs canada vs us
<hubik>	"what most don't know" - here we go..
<teenspirit>	The China Study did a study on this
<Mr-Potter>	which side is britain on
*	Mr-Potter presumes the US
<teenspirit>	britain isnt on either side
<teenspirit>	they're allies to both the us and china
<teenspirit>	its a secret alliance though
<teenspirit>	similar to the one hitler and obama have
<teenspirit>	yeah thats what they ddnt tell you in histor class
<hubik>	here we go, here we go, here we go
<hubik>	you have to go to hipster class to learn this shit
<teenspirit>	obama is actually a 5th dimensional reptillian illuminati
<coldsparrow>	haha
<teenspirit>	and hitler was just the puppet in all this
<Mr-Potter>	haha
<Mr-Potter>	floyd: Can I PM you?
<teenspirit>	i mean reptillians are all around us
<teenspirit>	reptillians are a mix between aliens and humans
<teenspirit>	the aliens abduct human beans and take us to their ship
<FreezingCold>	How common is black and white only printers in the workplace now?
<FreezingCold>	Pretty common?
<FreezingCold>	Deciding if I should write my reports in color, or black and white.
<pingfloyd>	teenspirit: step away from the glue
<dw1>	mm human beans
<dw1>	sounds like you took a bite of the forbidden fruit, my friend
<teenspirit>	yeah i did
<teenspirit>	i opened my chakras
<teenspirit>	and my third pineal gland
<teenspirit>	to be able to process the truth in the world
<pingfloyd>	you're a pineal gland
<teenspirit>	yeah i was like one
<teenspirit>	i was very calcified like one
<teenspirit>	but likely the information acted like a solvent on me and decalcified my pineals
<dw1>	now you have to spend a few years investigating every bullshit theory til you get sick of it :P
<dw1>	then peace at last
<Mr-Potter>	lol
<dw1>	lol
<teenspirit>	dw1: its all true
<pingfloyd>	in his bomb shelter living on spam
<dw1>	lol
<teenspirit>	aleister crowley was a pioneer truth seeker
<pingfloyd>	while the world keeps on turning
<teenspirit>	you need to understand that its very hard to read his book
<pingfloyd>	with a 40 year supply of tin foil
<teenspirit>	without the proper pineal postcalfiction program
<teenspirit>	yeah the EMF radiations are bad for me
<dw1>	his book about law? meh
<teenspirit>	yes
<dw1>	its irrelevant
<dw1>	our gov doesnt run on it
<teenspirit>	in his book he predicted science
<teenspirit>	he said we are stars
<teenspirit>	and its true
<teenspirit>	eisntein proved it
<pingfloyd>	wasn't he into the occult?
<teenspirit>	thats what most think
<teenspirit>	the gov tries to scare you away from the truth
<pingfloyd>	lol what most think
<pingfloyd>	here we go
<treefiddy_>	the calcified gland is actually an unformed twin that your body absorbed in the womb
<hubik>	here we go
<treefiddy_>	so you're really two people
<dw1>	lol treefiddy_
<treefiddy_>	thats where the psychic power comes from
<treefiddy_>	your 2nd self
<dw1>	sometimes i imagine another self is awake when im sleeping
<dw1>	in opposite-land
<dw1>	hahah
<treefiddy_>	near death experiences also open the conduit
<teenspirit>	treefiddy_: we're actually the same person
<treefiddy_>	but no nodule is needed
<teenspirit>	our goal in life is to turn into the same person
<treefiddy_>	you'll notice there's a different personality though
<treefiddy_>	if you listen close enough
<dw1>	people in your dream will never admit they're just part of your dream
<pingfloyd>	treefiddy_: no darwinistic strategies please
<dw1>	maintain the illusion of separation
<treefiddy_>	pingfloyd: if we're living in fantasy land. i'll do what i want!
<dw1>	!

<teenspirit>	its hard to unlock the chakras it really is
<treefiddy_>	nah
<atom138>	No no fuck that. Theres a new imagination song
<atom138>	It also replaces the little tune willy wonka plays to summon the oomps loompas
<atom138>	and the song of time
<atom138>	and the song from close encounters of a third kind
<pingfloyd>	nobody will forget that song
<pingfloyd>	from close encounters
<atom138>	I want to see the behind the music
<atom138>	Was he just recording farts and decided to slow one down and noticed it synced up perfectly?
<pingfloyd>	it was like the link at the center of that movie
<treefiddy_>	haha
<pingfloyd>	linked everything together
<atom138>	Or was he slaving over a gallon of baked beans for days trying to crank out that perfect butt puff
<treefiddy_>	bah bum da dum daaaaaa
<treefiddy_>	especially when they linked it with language origins
<atom138>	The comments on that post are GOLD

<treefiddy_>	ha le luh uh yahhhhh
<atom138>	I'm glad to learn that we live in a day an age where classical composers are farting into recording equipment and becoming instafamous from it
<MooingLemur>	are you talking about Mr. Methane?
<pingfloyd>	atom138: what is with all your fart talk?
<atom138>	lalelulilo was the name of a secret something or other in metal gear solid
<treefiddy_>	pingfloyd: fart fetish
<atom138>	The fart heard 'round the world on front page
<azizLIGHT>	the patriots??
<MooingLemur>	Mr. Methane: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFLw8aH-M2w
<pingfloyd>	atom138: I hope you shart

<atom138>	No srsly that guy farts a perfect whatever you call it
<pingfloyd>	is that the crowd control thing that makes people vomit?
<treefiddy_>	pitch
<treefiddy_>	yeah pingfloyd
<treefiddy_>	theres a searing pain one too
<pingfloyd>	vomit ray
<treefiddy_>	i think that one is light plus noise
<treefiddy_>	the vomit one
<atom138>	Theres a microwave one and a green laser one
<atom138>	and one thats deafening loud
<treefiddy_>	theres the kinda square one thats a pain beam. not quite microwaves i dont think
<pingfloyd>	a maser?
<treefiddy_>	no, newer
<treefiddy_>	hold on
<ssquirrel>	  waaa
<atom138>	Its not really a brown note its a vibration that more or less shakes your shit loose
<treefiddy_>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Denial_System
<treefiddy_>	that one
<pingfloyd>	shart cannon!
<atom138>	Yeah thats the microweave opne i was talking about
<treefiddy_>	kk
<atom138>	They make those here in my city believe it or not, same with tomahawk missles
<treefiddy_>	it's not a microwave though
<treefiddy_>	they operate at 95mhz
<ssquirrel>	hah
<atom138>	Directed energy...close enough
<spiritech>	I watched The Legend Of Hercules.
<treefiddy_>	microwaves are 2.4ghz
<lala>	swift110: Sometimes. Haha.
<treefiddy_>	whole different part of em spectrum
<hubik>	are you talking em or sound?
<atom138>	a shotgun blast is dorected energy technically
<ssquirrel>	cut the ugly green one in the back
<atom138>	Its a heat ray...it heats the surface of targets
<spiritech>	pretty good for a low budget film.
<atom138>	So its more like a microwave in that essence
<penguin1263>	i think im gonna press the spoof ingress button
<pingfloyd>	it's a slow cooker
<pingfloyd>	human slow cooker
<ssquirrel>	I can't stand it really...
<atom138>	but definitely not a microwave
<ssquirrel>	lol
<treefiddy_>	tasty
<ssquirrel>	I have 1,700 channels
<ssquirrel>	hahah
<swift110>	lala i see
<atom138>	Are you cheating on ingress?
<swift110>	lala im getting  bored. Likely I will go for a nice walk
<pingfloyd>	it's like a NuWave for people
<pingfloyd>	it's people!
<atom138>	The ADS millimeter wave energy works on a similar principle as a microwave oven,
<treefiddy_>	soylent green is people
<atom138>	You bastards made me feel wrong
<pingfloyd>	easy-bake soylent green edition
<ssquirrel>	you need beer
<atom138>	soylent green walking dead edition
<atom138>	All you need is the will to eat human flesh!
<ssquirrel>	blah... my c code no longer exists
<pingfloyd>	the easy-bake over in the future, you will bake your first soylent green cake all on your own.
<ssquirrel>	hahah

<pingfloyd>	chocolate is for rich assholes only at that point
<treefiddy_>	when grandma passes...

<honey>	lol supferrets

<FreezingCold>	atom138: one of my friends from college had the last name "lawless"

<Fowler>	That's a lot of material
<FreezingCold>	Fowler: physics?
<honey>	night.
<Fowler>	Biochem
<treefiddy_>	maybe there's lots of pictures and diagrams
<jenni>	treefiddy_: you can't speak but you can type.
<jenni>	really? So you're in the mirror?
<Fowler>	And then we have an exam on that material the next week
<FreezingCold>	ah. Yeah, some university classes are stupid with "assigned" reading that cover ~100 pages per week.
<FreezingCold>	It's like, I have four other courses, please fuck off.
<Fowler>	Plus an extra 90 pages the next week
<Fowler>	lol
<FreezingCold>	Just tell me what I ACTUALLY need to study.
<Fowler>	240 pages of material to study in two weeks with an exam at the end
<Fowler>	That's going to be fun
<atom138>	She dyes her eyebrows now...
<Fowler>	FreezingCold: They divide the summer into two six week sessions here and they cram a semester worth of material into each session
<FreezingCold>	Fowler: Same.
<Fowler>	Biochem for me this first session, ochem II next session
<FreezingCold>	Well, only for one course.
<drose379>	Who here takes photos with their android device?
<Fowler>	FreezingCold: I think this is about my limit
<FreezingCold>	drose379: I do, but recently switched to a Canon PowerShot.
<FreezingCold>	Fowler: I'm taking like 8 courses or something this summer.
<FreezingCold>	I stopped counting.
<Fowler>	Sounds stupid
<drose379>	Ok, say your on a day trip and are gonna take a few photos
<drose379>	And your also with someone else on the same trip
<Fowler>	FreezingCold: Isn't that like 25-40 credits?
<drose379>	And you guys wanna collab your photos together into one album
<FreezingCold>	Fowler: It's fun because I'm still going to get kicked out from my program because the associate dean is a massive dick.
<drose379>	You and the other person are the only two who can upload images to the album
<FreezingCold>	Yeah.
<Fowler>	You can even register for that many credits here
<FreezingCold>	You can't here either.
<drose379>	But you can download the images and share with others
<Fowler>	Why do you have to take such a stupid course load?
<FreezingCold>	I'm attending three different universities.
<Fowler>	That doesn't even seem possible
<drose379>	Is there something out there that can do that FreezingCold
<ssquirrel>	hah
<ssquirrel>	yes
<Fowler>	There's no way you can study that much and actually retain it all, that's like pure cram
<ssquirrel>	the sheriff
<ssquirrel>	I suppose you would argue that with eclipse
<FreezingCold>	Fowler: Four courses (online) from my home university. Two from an online university. Two this half-term from a local university, one or two the term half-term
<FreezingCold>	So 8 credits at the moment.
<Fowler>	Ew
<Fowler>	All online
<FreezingCold>	No, the half-term ones are in person.
<ssquirrel>	...
<Fowler>	Oh
<Fowler>	Either way, that sucks, because you aren't going to retain much of that
<ssquirrel>	see he is like a book ... you're not supposed to read
<ssquirrel>	heheh
<FreezingCold>	Fowler: To be honest the online courses are pretty easy to keep up with, because the professors don't suck.
<FreezingCold>	I hate going in person to class
<FreezingCold>	I never remember anything.
*	ssquirrel looks at college catalogue for dca
<ssquirrel>	lol lol
<FreezingCold>	Fowler: also, only half of my courses are hard.
<FreezingCold>	The other half are "easy"
<Fowler>	Yeah, that helps
<Fowler>	I took an Ethical Practice of Science course, something like that requires no studying
<Fowler>	You just gotta show up and do the weekly assignment and a couple of papers and you get an A
<FreezingCold>	The associate dean pissed me off so much at my home university that I doubt I'm ever going to go back to the province.
<klixa>	thats pretty much ALL college classes Fowler
<ssquirrel>	he did? the dean suspended me ...
<Fowler>	klixa: Uh
<Fowler>	No
<Fowler>	Not mine
<ssquirrel>	for computer hacking
<Fowler>	klixa: Maybe if you're a fucking liberal arts major or something
<ssquirrel>	language
<klixa>	Fowler: i was a physics major
<ssquirrel>	lol lol
<Fowler>	dang liberal arts major*
<FreezingCold>	I only told him I was registered for one class, and he refused to let me register for more classes. So instead, I had to pay more fees to other universities to register through them instead.
<klixa>	Fowler: in calculus we were given nightly assignments biut only tests counted
<FreezingCold>	The prick costed me like $2k easy.
<klixa>	Fowler: in physics, only tests and labs counted
<Fowler>	klixa: I've never had a course like that
<FreezingCold>	probably closer to $10k by the end of the year.
<Fowler>	Including calc and physics
<FreezingCold>	he can go fuck himself.

<FreezingCold>	ī
<irreverant>	who are we baggin on today?
<ssquirrel>	you argue a very harsh argument

<FreezingCold>	hue hue blue
<ssquirrel>	this guy andrew / Mr. Potter
