<duncannz>	When I nmap my server I have 22/ssh, 80/http, 111/rpcbind and 6667/irc open. I recognise ssh, http and ssh but not rpcbind. I tried googling what it is but I'm not really clear. Is it safe to leave open?
<brucelee>	it doesnt show up in mount BenjiWiebe
<ayecee>	duncannz: probably related to nfs
<BenjiWiebe>	brucelee: Very interesting...wanna bring your computer over? I'd love to poke around in it.
<duncannz>	ayecee: don't have that
<brucelee>	BenjiWiebe: that would be the best :p
<brucelee>	wouldnt that be awesome if we could just do that
<BenjiWiebe>	brucelee: Do you happen to live in central Kansas? :)
<brucelee>	BenjiWiebe: california
<ponyrider>	brucelee: brucelee we can just give me your admin password and open ssh for me
<brucelee>	BenjiWiebe: in /proc/mounts it shows up as rootfs / rootfs rw 0 0
<BenjiWiebe>	brucelee: Yeah, what ponyrider said...that'd work.
<brucelee>	haha
<brucelee>	cant do that either :)
<ponyrider>	lol
<ponyrider>	are you sure?
<ponyrider>	lol
<duoi>	hi, i tried installing vestacp to manage my debian VPS but i can no longer SSH into my machine (times out). any ideas?
<ayecee>	duncannz: cleaning lady hit the power cord
<duncannz>	ayecee: uhhh?
<duncannz>	it's a VPS by the way
<ayecee>	you think that vps are wireless?
<brucelee>	ponyrider: 100% :)
<BenjiWiebe>	brucelee: What distro/version are you using?
<duncannz>	ayecee: no I just don't get the reference
<duncannz>	...
<xeon-enouf>	duoi: no idea wth vestacp is, try ssh -vvv and check logs
<ayecee>	xeon-enouf: swing and a miss
<xeon-enouf>	duncannz: stop or uninstall sunrpc
<xeon-enouf>	yp/NIS related
<ayecee>	oh.
<ayecee>	it was me that made the error.
<xeon-enouf>	batter up!
<ayecee>	duncannz: sorry, didn't mean to confuse you.
<duncannz>	ok haha
<duncannz>	xeon-enouf: sudo service sunrpc status => sunrpc: unrecognized service
<xeon-enouf>	well; ps auxf
<xeon-enouf>	ss  #see what the name of service is     or ... netstat -tuap  or -tunap
<xeon-enouf>	duncannz: grep 111 /etc/services
<duncannz>	xeon-enouf: heh, sunrpc		111/tcp		portmapper	# RPC 4.0 portmapper
<xeon-enouf>	yes, it's just a reference file; not a conffile
<duncannz>	so how do I find out what package introduced it? (debian)
<xeon-enouf>	what service?
<ayecee>	duncannz: probably nfs-common
<duncannz>	port 111/tcp is open on my server when I scan it from my laptop.
<duncannz>	firstly is it something I should be worried about?
<ayecee>	no
<xeon-enouf>	install harden-doc  #debian pkg
<xeon-enouf>	and debian-reference
<xeon-enouf>	apt-file search doesn't return anything useful
<duoi>	xeon-enouf, vestacp is a cpanel alternative
<duncannz>	alright I'll just ignore it then
<xeon-enouf>	um..    rgrep sunrpc /etc/rc*.d/
<xeon-enouf>	don't  #learn to find out wtf is going on
<xeon-enouf>	don't ignore it, i mean
<xeon-enouf>	duoi: that's nice
<xeon-enouf>	hrm Documentation/sysctl/sunrpc.txt.gz
<xeon-enouf>	in 3.2
<xeon-enouf>	yikes, doc text mentions kernel 2.2  O_o
<SirLagz>	I remember kernel 2.2...I tried playing around with ipchains on 2.2
<xeon-enouf>	never got untangled eh?
*	xeon-enouf runs
<SirLagz>	xeon-enouf: lol
<xeon-enouf>	shackles and cackles :-p
<xeon-enouf>	hrm, something keeps altering my /etc/resolv.conf ; but it's definitely not the resolvconf pkg .. :-(
<onthemic>	Hello, I had my site running perfectly fine with nginx, but I decided to uninstall and recompile nginx with rtmp module, now I am getting 403 & 500 errors
<onthemic>	Can anyone offer advice for troubleshooting?
<xeon-enouf>	so, since no immutable flags avail on this FS, i just chmod'd 0000
<ayecee>	should be easy enough to revert
<xeon-enouf>	onthemic: reinstall pkg from distro?
<onthemic>	uninstall compiled version with rtmp?
<onthemic>	that is good idea
<Loshki>	xeon-enouf: quite a few things will mess with resolv.conf, notably network managers...
<xeon-enouf>	Loshki: no nm here ...
<DLange>	systemdeeeee?
<Loshki>	xeon-enouf: how do you get your network connectivity?
<xeon-enouf>	no systemd, and ifup/down ... one sec #old debian
<xeon-enouf>	dhclient even
<Loshki>	xeon-enouf: I believe dhclient will overwrite /etc/resolv.conf if it receives dns info in a dhcp reply.
<xeon-enouf>	but, what happens is the /etc/resolv.conf is entirely overwritten it seems; all comments/edits gone.. It's adding my ISP router addy as the single nameserver entry; rather than opendns, as i had it
<xeon-enouf>	yea; i'm going to check out the files in /var now
<Loshki>	xeon-enouf: presumably there's a dhclient flag to prevent this, or some other magic config.
<xeon-enouf>	ahh... old entries in /var/lib/dhcp3/dhclient.eth0.leases  have old options lines
<xeon-enouf>	imma gonna delete this POFS :-)
<DLange>	xeon-enouf: sudo fatrace -o /tmp/trace # and you see anything that mangles stuff on your box
<Loshki>	Piece of Fine Software
<sauvin>	s/fine/freaking/;
<xeon-enouf>	nothing in apt-file for fatrace
<xeon-enouf>	though, i know my apt-file is broken for the backports Contents.gz , i'll fix it soon
<ayecee>	the missing command macro says the package is called fatrace
<DLange>	xeon-enouf: https://launchpad.net/fatrace
<onthemic>	Hello, I had a simple web site running with nginx, and decided I wanted to try nginx with rtmp module, so I uninstall nginx (sudo apt-get remove nginx) then compiled nginx with the rtmp module, the compilation was successful as rtmp works however I am getting 403 & 500 http errors
<xeon-enouf>	DLange: ok. let me see
<ayecee>	onthemic: it looks like you left the autorepeat on.
<DLange>	xeon-enouf: https://packages.debian.org/jessie/fatrace # only in jessie+
<xeon-enouf>	oh, so it runs as a daemon, then you just check the /tmp file periodically for datestamps/filenames/processes?
<xeon-enouf>	yea - i'll get it soon - thanks ;-)
<justanotheruser>	anyone want to share their opinion on this debian upgrade? It looks like it wants to remove some critical stuff to fix conflicts including xserver-xorg-video-<a few things> http://hastebin.com/ewifaroqum.vhdl
<xeon-enouf>	i suppose inotify-tools could've also helped
<ayecee>	justanotheruser: i'd love to share my opinion.
<xeon-enouf>	inotifywait/inotifywatch
<xeon-enouf>	thanks DLange
<justanotheruser>	ayecee: ?
<ayecee>	justanotheruser: it's broken. take backups and reinstall. or, take backups and try one of the suggested solutions from aptitude. either way, take backups first.
<justanotheruser>	aww
<justanotheruser>	okay thanks
<justanotheruser>	anyway I can try to find the source of the breaking so I don't do it again?
*	era is now known as Guest18508
<xeon-enouf>	it's likely a one-off
<justanotheruser>	hm?
<ayecee>	justanotheruser: sure. just pore over the recommendations from aptitude until blood starts leaking out of your ears.
<xeon-enouf>	try apt-get install -f   #prior to upgrading
<ayecee>	that's the way i do it.
<xeon-enouf>	did you add do a dist-upgrade prior to changing sources.list?
<justanotheruser>	no
<xeon-enouf>	then you did an update, prior to upgrade?
<justanotheruser>	I only updated
<justanotheruser>	no
<xeon-enouf>	well you should've
<justanotheruser>	well I haven't upgraded yet :P
<xeon-enouf>	justanotheruser: well..
<ayecee>	dist-upgrade doesn't change the distribution version, despite the name.
<xeon-enouf>	apt-get -s ....
<xeon-enouf>	I presumed he was doing an upgrade ; it can ayecee
<ayecee>	apt-get install -f is a good idea, though.
<xeon-enouf>	if one has stable in their sources rather than wheezy
<xeon-enouf>	then BAM
<xeon-enouf>	you go from wheezy -> jessie
<justanotheruser>	yeah, but I am still on wheezy, no jessie stuff installed as of now
<xeon-enouf>	justanotheruser: what does sources.list say? wheezy? or stable in the lines
<xeon-enouf>	if it says stable, change it to wheezy; unless you really want to upgrade to jessie
<ayecee>	justanotheruser: you could also try apt-get install each of the broken packages individually. could reduce the complexity of the solution that aptitude has to prepare.
<xeon-enouf>	and even if you do
<justanotheruser>	xeon-enouf: wheezy
<xeon-enouf>	change to wheezy first ; then dist-upgrade ; then change sources.list to jessie, then update, then upgrade
<xeon-enouf>	READ RELEASE NOTES PRIOR!
<DLange>	justanotheruser: follow the system-clean-up steps from https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/amd64/release-notes/ch-upgrading.html before the upgrade
<justanotheruser>	xeon-enouf: well I already am on wheezy
<ayecee>	justanotheruser: backup/reinstall sounds easier now, eh?
<justanotheruser>	ayecee: if I had access to an external drive, yes :P
<justanotheruser>	it wants to remove almost identical packages if I dist-upgrade with wheezy :/
<justanotheruser>	I don't know what I did to break it, but I did a good job of it
<justanotheruser>	yeah, sounds like a backup /home and reinstall
<justanotheruser>	always is a pain since I have an encrypted drive though :P
<xeon-enouf>	no, try to upgrade first; after backing up.. if you don't go through the entire procedure, you'll never learn anything
<xeon-enouf>	now, i'm going to finnaly look at your pastebin -- few mins
<silverdust>	Does du command stores cache?
<xeon-enouf>	i don't see anything
<silverdust>	I ran `du -h` on a file before compression and after compression and still gives the same result
<silverdust>	stat gives the accurate results
<xeon-enouf>	it's blank - use a different paste site justanotheruser - and make the url short; spruge.us even
<xeon-enouf>	sprunge.us
<duoi>	xeon-enouf, tried ssh -vvv, came back with "Could not resolve hostname xxxx: Name or service is not known"
<justanotheruser>	xeon-enouf: do you have js?
<xeon-enouf>	no js
<justanotheruser>	http://hastebin.com/raw/ewifaroqum
<xeon-enouf>	silverdust: try echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches ; echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
<xeon-enouf>	silverdust: or lsof | grep deleted
<penos>	hello my friends
<xeon-enouf>	ok - got the raw
<penos>	a bit nauseous so listening to meditation music
<xeon-enouf>	whoa ... justanotheruser  1800+ pkgs? hahah that's worse than me
<xeon-enouf>	justanotheruser: you likely should be upgrading squeeze first! :-P
<justanotheruser>	xeon-enouf: hah please
<xeon-enouf>	the xorg-* pkgs are likely not needed on your system
<justanotheruser>	Yes, I need to learn to maintain
<justanotheruser>	On that machine I tend to just get things to work and leave them
<xeon-enouf>	you can tell pretty easily via grep drv /var/log/Xorg.0.log
<xeon-enouf>	yep
*	metastableB is now known as metastableB|away
<xeon-enouf>	well; if you had squeeze prior, you should really go back to upgrading that; then moving up to wheezy; when did you alter sources.list last?
<justanotheruser>	a minute ago
<xeon-enouf>	2GB of software
<xeon-enouf>	justanotheruser: haha...
<xeon-enouf>	justanotheruser: fail
<justanotheruser>	I had wheezy then I went to squeeze then back to wheezy
<xeon-enouf>	oh?
<justanotheruser>	s/squeeze/jessie/
<xeon-enouf>	explain that better
<xeon-enouf>	no no no..
<justanotheruser>	but I only updated, never upgraded
<xeon-enouf>	squeeze -> wheezy -> jessie
<justanotheruser>	I don't think I've used squeeze on this machine?
<xeon-enouf>	release notes release notes release notes  ... Installation Guide!
<xeon-enouf>	heh
<xeon-enouf>	updating just refreshes the local cache
<xeon-enouf>	so you can see if there are new pkgs
<xeon-enouf>	apt-cache policy... etc
<justanotheruser>	I know
<justanotheruser>	I didn't upgrade *because* of all these conflicts
<xeon-enouf>	yea - welp, the time has come ;-)
<xeon-enouf>	but yea, make backups; then do the magic
<justanotheruser>	1) saw new debian was out 2) changed sources.list 3) updated 4) tried upgrading, saw conflicts 5) came here and asked 6) switched sources back to wheezy
<xeon-enouf>	i tend to do major ones like that from console only, least amt of soft running
<y0wza>	o lord
<xeon-enouf>	justanotheruser: aha!
<xeon-enouf>	justanotheruser: one sec
<duoi>	xeon-enouf, it worked! i had to -p the port (not sure why) but it worked in the end
<xeon-enouf>	mv the files that reference jessie from /var/lib/apt/lists/
<xeon-enouf>	duoi: cool
<xeon-enouf>	justanotheruser: ^
<xeon-enouf>	then, with wheezy still in sources.list, run update and upgrade, then dist-upgrade -- use apt-get -s ... for simulation
<silverdust>	xeon-enouf: echo 3 was fine, echo 0 failed
<justanotheruser>	xeon-enouf: no files there have jessie in their name
<xeon-enouf>	see if it wants you to reboot (new/fixed kernel patches)
<silverdust>	Error while writing to stdout
<xeon-enouf>	justanotheruser: what's there?
<silverdust>	write_loop: invalid argument
<Bose>	personally I like sudo rm -rf / :) But then I get kicked out of channels to suggest that :D
<xeon-enouf>	silverdust: try again
<NoSpace>	then make rm -rf /bin/login
<justanotheruser>	ftp.us.debian.org_debian_dists_X_Y where X is wheezy, testing, stable and Y is something like backports, updates, or something else
<xeon-enouf>	silverdust: you probably used a : rather than a ; ?
<xeon-enouf>	but just echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
<Bose>	Good suggestion NoSpace :D
<xeon-enouf>	justanotheruser: well jessie = stable now
<xeon-enouf>	see the conundrum?
<justanotheruser>	no
*	metastableB|away is now known as metastableB|clou
<justanotheruser>	when those files were made wheezy was stable
*	metastableB|clou is now known as metastableB|clwd
<NoSpace>	:-p
<xeon-enouf>	justanotheruser: so - look at time stamps
<justanotheruser>	so I'm not sure what you're saying
<xeon-enouf>	i'm saying the Stable ones are likely referencing Jessie
<xeon-enouf>	not wheezy
<xeon-enouf>	and wtf? Testing?
<xeon-enouf>	o m g
<xeon-enouf>	ok - we're done
<xeon-enouf>	:-P
<penos>	hello my linux friends

<justanotheruser>	xeon-enouf: most created yesterday
<justanotheruser>	xeon-enouf: we're done?
<justanotheruser>	lol
<justanotheruser>	I think I only used testing for by chroot
<justanotheruser>	*my
<justanotheruser>	okay, thanks for your help
<xeon-enouf>	justanotheruser: you broked it beyond help from properly fixing via backtracking .. you'll be best served attempting to just mv up to jessie  - if anything about testing/codename is in sources.list, you'll be f'd
<silverdust>	xeon-enouf: I had ran the command without everything after ; then I copied it all and pasted as you gave
<xeon-enouf>	justanotheruser: still; there
<justanotheruser>	?
<justanotheruser>	yeah, I guess backup, install jessie and hide
<xeon-enouf>	s pinning for that .. and it wouldn't be in there, if you used a chroot
<xeon-enouf>	silverdust: still errors?
<silverdust>	yes. Same error
<justanotheruser>	maybe I should just use lenny
<silverdust>	I'm doing this as root
<xeon-enouf>	right, hrm.. so .. sysctl -a | grep vm.drop_caches
<silverdust>	output is vm.drop_caches = 3
<penos>	!gnu
<penos>	...
<penos>	which one is better? microsoft office 2016 or emacs?
<xeon-enouf>	silverdust: echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches   #shows exactly what?
<xeon-enouf>	silverdust: you're not using a O are you?
<xeon-enouf>	it's a Zero silverdust
<xeon-enouf>	man proc  #to learn more about what you're doing silverdust
<xeon-enouf>	justanotheruser: Benny and the Jets is likely a better choice :-P

<snkcld>	what rules are typically used, in a .desktop file, in order for the window manager to know to group different windows together?
<snkcld>	i ask because, my chrome browser windows, and my chrome "app shortcuts" are grouped into the same
<snkcld>	and id prefer if they were seperate
<xeon-enouf>	no idea; try freedesktop.org perhaps.. and also review /usr/share/apps/*/* files
<xeon-enouf>	if using gnome; irc.gnome.org perhaps
<xeon-enouf>	find /usr/share -name '*.desktop'    take a peek inside
<naptr>	grouping windows on the desktop?
<naptr>	what window manager?
<snkcld>	gdm
<xeon-enouf>	ahh, under /applications/
<snkcld>	im looking at the files
<xeon-enouf>	the WM is likely more likely responsible, or the app
<snkcld>	hmm
<xeon-enouf>	gdm is a Display Manager
<xeon-enouf>	not a WM
<snkcld>	sorry yea
<snkcld>	gnome shell
<snkcld>	im looking at the desktop entrys and nothing seems obvious
<xeon-enouf>	well.. apps also store config under ~/.cache
<xeon-enouf>	and under ~/.local
<xeon-enouf>	so search there too
<snkcld>	yea im looking at ~/.local/share/applications
<xeon-enouf>	though not in .desktop format
<snkcld>	.cache though? hmm
<xeon-enouf>	yep
<xeon-enouf>	see ~/.cache/chromium for ex
<xeon-enouf>	meh, i see caches basically; but like for ex, something like midori has an /icons dir there
<xeon-enouf>	snkcld: update-alternative --list x-window-manager   #does it really list gnome-shell?
<xeon-enouf>	snkcld: update-alternatives --list x-window-manager   #does it really list gnome-shell?
<xeon-enouf>	note the added s
<snkcld>	let me see
<snkcld>	eh, im on gentoo
<xeon-enouf>	oh
<xeon-enouf>	heh
<snkcld>	 /shrug
<xeon-enouf>	nvm ;-)
<snkcld>	idk, if i could just find the code
<snkcld>	for gnome shell
<snkcld>	where it decides how to group, then i can make the change
<xeon-enouf>	i suppose you could ls -l /var/run ; or just /run
<xeon-enouf>	i don't even know what you mean by "app shortcuts"
<xeon-enouf>	i have used google-chrome browser in the past; but.. meh, a while ago
<snkcld>	yea uh, so, with chrome... you can make any page a "application" i guess, by hitting "create application shortcut"
<snkcld>	so, it creates a desktop file etc for you, with the icon and all that jazz
<snkcld>	and the app looks like a regular ol' app, outside of chrome
<snkcld>	obviously its really just chrome
<snkcld>	which is why its getting grouped together ig uess
<xeon-enouf>	oh dear
<xeon-enouf>	that seems highly app specific
<xeon-enouf>	not that you cannot mimic it
<snkcld>	wel
<xeon-enouf>	maybe something in gazillion gconf-*
<xeon-enouf>	maybe something in gazillion gconf2-*
<snkcld>	hm
<xeon-enouf>	editor, etc
*	xeon-enouf is going back a few yrs even
<snkcld>	meh, i just disabled "window grouping" in alt tab
<snkcld>	its never really been helpful to me
<snkcld>	i dont understand the workflow behind it
<snkcld>	 /shrug
*	xeon-enouf joins in on the /shrug
<snkcld>	 /shrug is probably my favorite expression
<doug16k>	since 15.04 my i915 GPU lockup is fixed (great!) but my battery life is wrecked because it screws up the counts for power wells, many dmesg spams for WARN_ON(!power_well->count)

<xeon-enouf>	doug16k: hrmph, someone here suggested fatrace pkg for me, for entirely other reasons; but i noticed, from its Description its doing some power-usage monitoring and using powertop? might either powertop or fatrace be the issue?

<nikio_>	hey can someone help me install this: http://www.pdal.io/compilation/unix.html
<nikio_>	I am already stuck at the very first step: git clone git@github.com:PDAL/PDAL.git pdal

<xeon-enouf>	justanotheruser: at command
<xeon-enouf>	justanotheruser: man at

<xeon-enouf>	make sure atd is running
<nikio_>	hydraidm801, perhaps not
<NoSpace>	http://www.pdal.io/docs.html
<hydraidm801>	nikio_: lol you might want to install that first
<xeon-enouf>	k_sze[work]: no idea; but i use things like 'parted /dev/sdX u b p q' often
<xeon-enouf>	ah, -s = script
<xeon-enouf>	just put all commands in the script
<nikio_>	it said i have git version 1.7.10.4
<xeon-enouf>	yea, installing git isn't going to fix a publickey issue
<k_sze[work]>	xeon-enouf: because I'm looking at this and I'm quite surprised: http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/manual/html_chapter/parted_8.html
<xeon-enouf>	you need the key
<k_sze[work]>	(look at step 10)
<mAniAk-_->	nikio_: looks like its the wrong git link, copy it from his git site instead

<MrNaz>	When I create a shell script by pasting the script into a putty window with vim, my script works. When i try to save it to the same dir using notepad++ (over ssh) i get what appear to be character encoding errors, even though the locale on the server is utf8 and notepad++ is set to save as utf8...
<MrNaz>	can anyone give me any pointers as to where to look for whta i'm doing wrong?
<xeon-enouf>	maybe try other editors, geany, gedit, nano etc.. to see if it's a notepad++ issue?
<MrNaz>	perhaps... i've been using notepad++ for this sort of thing for years
<MrNaz>	web dev and stuff
<MrNaz>	even prepping ebooks, which are very sensitive to char encoding
<MrNaz>	but i am doing the right thing, yes? saving as utf8?

<nikio_>	mAniAk-_-, where did it clone to/
<nikio_>	it said cloning into PDAL
<nikio_>	but no path
<doug16k>	xeon-enouf, doubt it - that assert is in device-specific code, it messes up the counts on power wells. it asserts to dmesg when it is about to decrement a zero refcount - which should never happen
<doug16k>	the assert is in kernel code, in the i915 driver
<MrNaz>	_|x|_ / xeon-enouf  http://paste.linuxassist.net/view/b3328abf  <-- that's a cat of both scripts, and the output
<nikio_>	rtyx@rtyxy:~/PDAL/makefiles$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"
<nikio_>	CMake Error: The source directory "/home/rtyx/PDAL/makefiles" does not appear to contain CMakeLists.txt.
<nikio_>	thats what happened after their Configure base library step
<xeon-enouf>	doug16k: ah, so you've dug into the exact code and found where the error lies; file bug report, offer patches? ;-)
<nikio_>	http://www.pdal.io/compilation/unix.html
<xeon-enouf>	MrNaz: run a diff on them
<MrNaz>	http://paste.linuxassist.net/view/f0db4eb6
<nikio_>	any suggestions? I am just following hei install guide.
<nikio_>	*their
<doug16k>	xeon-enouf, I dug into the code a bit yeah, but not enough to find the bug :)
<MrNaz>	one's in ASCII and the other is in UTF8
<xeon-enouf>	comm -3 <(sort file1) <(sort file2)
<xeon-enouf>	why? both were supposed to be utf8, one from notepad++, one from another editor
<MrNaz>	xeon-enouf http://paste.linuxassist.net/view/f0db4eb6 so the one that works is in ASCII... that seems very odd to me
<MrNaz>	the one from vim is the ascii one
<xeon-enouf>	doug16k: well, you get where i'm saying; #intel-gfx or even kernel drm subsystem might be best
<nikio_>	mAniAk-_-, ?
<mAniAk-_->	nikio_: i wouldnt know
<Sbroker`>	greetings
<nikio_>	kk : /
<MrNaz>	xeon-enouf http://paste.linuxassist.net/view/0e1eff38
<xeon-enouf>	nikio_: cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../
<xeon-enouf>	you forgot the ../
<doug16k>	xeon-enouf, debugging a display driver is not fun - can you remote kernel-debug in linux?
<xeon-enouf>	MrNaz: hopefully someone else can help ; i'm terrible at this stuff (fonts/encodings)
<doug16k>	I've done kernel-debugging in windows before
<xeon-enouf>	sure; gdb, and kgdb -- but then ask in ##kernel please
<nikio_>	xeon-enouf, ty
<xeon-enouf>	doug16k: show them what you've learned ; and give them a day or so to reply if needed
<nikio_>	now i got CMake 2.8.11 or higher is required.  You are running version 2.8.9
<nikio_>	what command to best use to update?
<xeon-enouf>	it's slow there
<MrNaz>	xeon-enouf fair enough... thanks for the suggestion of trying file... at least im closer than i was before :)
<xeon-enouf>	doug16k: perhaps even start with a git bisect, heh
<nikio_>	im on Debian
<xeon-enouf>	cool MrNaz
<MrNaz>	xeon-enouf thanks :)
<xeon-enouf>	MrNaz: ah, sorry, it's cat -A   #see man cat :-)
<doug16k>	xeon-enouf, scary part is, the last update fixed my gpu hang issue and introduced power use issue. if they fix the power issue, it might bring back the gpu hang D:
<MrNaz>	yep i figured that too :)
<ronh>	how to achieve highest video quality on a tv connected to htpc? should I 1) output full rgb and set TV input to full rgb (this will clip whiter than whites, though) or 2) output 16-235 from PC and set TV to limited RGB. if second, where should I set limited rgb? in the
<xeon-enouf>	doug16k: i realize! but ... regressions happen all the time (or is it a new feature? the power_well thing)
<xeon-enouf>	MrNaz: ;-)
<xeon-enouf>	ronh: #videolan , and/or  #v4l
<xeon-enouf>	or ##hardware
<doug16k>	xeon-enouf, pretty sure that is a hardware thing, that the driver needs to mess around with on demand
<ronh>	xeon-enouf thanks
<xeon-enouf>	doug16k: well, there's some kernel-parameters.txt params you might try, like iommu= .. perhaps
<doug16k>	my understanding is, each thing that wants to keep the gpu spun up, increments the power well count. when you no longer need it spun up, you release the power well. if those counts get off by 1, it stays spun up forever
<xeon-enouf>	doug16k: hrm, i don't see any specific linux-{gfx,gpu,drm} subsystems listed at vger.kernel.org -- perhaps shoot a mail to linux-kernel mailing list (lkml)
<doug16k>	oh almost forgot to mention https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1449893
<xeon-enouf>	the /Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt
<xeon-enouf>	doug16k: oh wait - a ubuntu kernel, right?
<doug16k>	I did end up asking in #ubuntu-kernel
<doug16k>	yes
<xeon-enouf>	hit them up FIRST! -- ok .. heh
<xeon-enouf>	yeah, upstream would be like ...
<doug16k>	lol
<xeon-enouf>	ok
<xeon-enouf>	;0
<nurupo>	any idea why this 3-line bash script doesn't run? http://pastebin.com/XSFrxFht
<nurupo>	0expected to get printed 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18
<xeon-enouf>	nurupo: add set -x on 2nd line
<doug16k>	nurupo, need do on line 4
<xeon-enouf>	doesn't run? it's not +x ?
<doug16k>	wait no that isn't bash
<nurupo>	oh
<xeon-enouf>	they said bash - but i didn't look :-P
<nurupo>	looks like i missed "do"
<nurupo>	derp, works
<doug16k>	oh it is bash, nevermind lol
<nurupo>	thanks
<xeon-enouf>	haha
<colo-work>	other than that, don't use backticks, and don't use seq.
<doug16k>	I played around with the kernel parameters for the i915 driver - no difference
<doug16k>	oops wrong chat
<nikio_>	why did I get : http://pastie.org/10119800
<nikio_>	?
<peetaur2>	nikio_: "recompile with -fPIC" is what it says
<peetaur2>	if you want to ask why and not how to fix it, maybe ask in #C
<nikio_>	peetaur2, where does it say it?
<barq>	On my Kubuntu shell the autocomplete is not working anymore when I press tab. How can I fix this?
<peetaur2>	nikio_: on the end of the longest line at the end; just search for the text I quoted
<nikio_>	ok
<peetaur2>	barq: are you sure it isn't just more selective and annoying? like  unzip blah.zip.tmp   will not autocomplete, but  unzip blah.zip will?
<nikio_>	peetaur2, so what do I do now? im following the steps here: cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../
<nikio_>	http://www.pdal.io/compilation/unix.html
<barq>	Directories will autocomplete, files will not (anymore=
<peetaur2>	nikio_: somewhere in the Makefile or in the ./configure options, you add that. Look for a variable in Makefile like CC_FLAGS or LD_FLAGS or something like that
<barq>	It doesn't give me options either if I tab twice.
<peetaur2>	it is at the ld step, so you'd think LD_FLAGS, but it says "recompile" so I guess it means ld failed because CC_FLAGS needed it
<peetaur2>	barq: if it is what I described like adding .tmp breaks it, then double tab also won't work
<nikio_>	peetaur2, http://pastie.org/10119807
<nikio_>	which do  I chose?
<MrElendig>	barq: depends on which shell you ae running
<MrElendig>	are*
<peetaur2>	nikio_: "Makefile"
<peetaur2>	the "make" command uses "Make
<peetaur2>	file"
<peetaur2>	and others are only relevant if called from that Makefile
<barq>	Konsole Version 2.13.2 Using KDE Development Platform 4.13.3.
<peetaur2>	barq: shell, not console
<peetaur2>	barq: $0 --version
<barq>	GNU bash, version 4.3.11(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)
<barq>	MrElendig: ^
<alonewater>	a
<nikio_>	peetaur2, http://pastie.org/10119815
<nikio_>	no flags
<peetaur2>	nikio_: "CMAKE generated file: DO NOT EDIT!" to make a claim like that, they must have provided you another way to do it... maybe with whatever command generated the Makefile
*	vparad0x is now known as viralex
<nikio_>	peetaur2, no: http://www.pdal.io/compilation/unix.html
<nikio_>	I honestly am following everything step by step
<peetaur2>	nikio_: "cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../"    try cmake --help and see where you can add such flags
<Orbixx>	Is there a channel here that prints kernel commit messages?
<peetaur2>	and I don't see it in the man page... maybe also ask in #C :D
<nikio_>	peetaur2, i think this is cpp
<nikio_>	http://stackoverflow.com/a/12898561
<nikio_>	should i just add CXXFLAGS = -FPIC in the beginning of the Makefile?
<peetaur2>	also add CFLAGS just in case. and lower case f (-fPIC)
<nikio_>	ok
<Filystyn>	how to see what character sets i have on my linux
<Filystyn>	nvm  got it
<k_sze[work]>	How do I find the ENV{ID_TYPE} of a block device?
<k_sze[work]>	I mean the ENV{ID_TYPE} that I'm supposed to put in udev rules.
<k_sze[work]>	udevinfo -q env?
<xeon-enouf>	k_sze[work]: udevadm info -a -p /dev/name
<xeon-enouf>	k_sze[work]: udevadm info -a -p /dev/name | grep ENV  #even
<xeon-enouf>	udevinfo is deprecated, for udevadm {monitor,info,control..}
<k_sze[work]>	I see
<k_sze[work]>	thanks
<xeon-enouf>	k_sze[work]: gah, use -n rather than -p
<xeon-enouf>	the -p is for /sys/ paths; the -n is for /dev/ paths
<xeon-enouf>	and the -p doesn't even require the /sys/ prefix; so -p /class/net/eth0  would suffice
<xeon-enouf>	bah
<k_sze[work]>	hmm, there is actually no occurence of 'ENV' in the output.
<k_sze[work]>	and no ID_TYPE (or anything that hints at that) that I could spot.
<xeon-enouf>	right; which is it for?
<k_sze[work]>	which what?
<k_sze[work]>	you mean which node?
<xeon-enouf>	what type of device
<k_sze[work]>	It's a RAID volume
<k_sze[work]>	attached to an Adaptec RAID card.
<k_sze[work]>	'/dev/sdb1' in this case
<xeon-enouf>	ahh ; try perhaps /dev/sdb | grep -i id
<dob1>	hi, how can i get detailed information about a shutdown ?   i am not able to identify which user has shutdown a pc. i used lastlog, last, look in /var/log/syslog but i am not able to understand who execute a shutdown
<k_sze[work]>	nope, nothing like that either.
<k_sze[work]>	And the udevadm manpage doesn't list the short options.
<Sbroker`>	My Jessie Ferrari Customized: https://plus.google.com/photos/107634984391828157026/albums/6143083860116157457
<k_sze[work]>	-a corresponds to --attribute-walk?
<k_sze[work]>	(or maybe the manpage sucks only because I'm on Debian 7?)
<xeon-enouf>	yea
<xeon-enouf>	rgrep ENV /usr/share/doc/udev/
<xeon-enouf>	which also isn't much, just says ENV={some_var}
<xeon-enouf>	heck, even rgrep -l ENV /etc/udev #shows very little odd things using it
<xeon-enouf>	yikes!  kernel.org udev docs redirects to freedesktop.org libsystemd  O_P
<naptr>	xeon-enouf: what's your version of a script to list all files, recursively, from $cwd to display as "filename: " + name
<xeon-enouf>	er libudev-> systemd/libudev    and udev/ -> /systemd
<xeon-enouf>	filename + name?
<xeon-enouf>	find
<naptr>	"filename: " + name_of_file
<naptr>	"filename: %s"
<xeon-enouf>	filename = name of file
<naptr>	something to the effect.
<naptr>	echo "filename: %s"
<xeon-enouf>	wtf?
<xeon-enouf>	somefile: %s
<naptr>	naa, a string "filename: "
<naptr>	with the name of the file after it
<xeon-enouf>	so say that; you want to print the word filename: before each file
<naptr>	right.
<naptr>	i came up with something using 'ls' but, want to see this with find.
<thms>	.
<thms>	I'm having a hard time understand what the -H of rsync does. It treats hard-linked files (which is just the location of the actual file if I googled it) as if they were separate files (by default) and -H copies the hard links.
<thms>	s/understand/understanding
<naptr>	thms: so, it copies the hard link as a file, instead of copying the file that the hard link is trying to link to.
<xeon-enouf>	for i in * ; do find . echo "filename: $i" ; done
<xeon-enouf>	er
<xeon-enouf>	for i in * ; do echo "filename: $i" ; done
<xeon-enouf>	find . -exec echo filename: {} \;
<xeon-enouf>	naptr: ^
<naptr>	ok, without the entire path, just the name of the file.
<xeon-enouf>	thms: a hardlink is another entry in the same inode, but with a different name
<xeon-enouf>	thms: find /bin -samefile /bin/uncompress -ls
<xeon-enouf>	naptr: what? the find .  #does that
*	naptr could always use more regex in his life.
<xeon-enouf>	oh
<xeon-enouf>	use basename
<naptr>	ahh ok.
<xeon-enouf>	or ... find ParameterExpansion on mywiki.wooledge.org
<naptr>	rather than piping to awk/sed ?
<Filystyn>	what default charset uses linux? (utf-8 ??? )
<xeon-enouf>	yea
<xeon-enouf>	Filystyn: grep NLS /boot/config-$(uname -r)
<xeon-enouf>	Filystyn: grep NLS /boot/config-$(uname -r) | grep DEFAULT
<Filystyn>	yep utf8
<Filystyn>	thx
<xeon-enouf>	np
<xeon-enouf>	Filystyn: though note; mounts like say CIFS could be mounted other ways; see man mount.cifs and the iocharset= option and codepage= options
<xeon-enouf>	cat /proc/mounts
<Filystyn>	eee ? i need it  only to convert a charset i gave to all kinds of charsets i have than ill memcpy it  back and see the resoult
<k_sze[work]>	Just me or this is just wrong? http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/6.2/chapter07/symlinks.html
<k_sze[work]>	ENV{ID_PATH}=="pci-0000:00:07.1-ide-1:1"
<xeon-enouf>	k_sze[work]: that info exists in both ls -l /dev/disk/*  and /sys/ in places
<xeon-enouf>	in /by-path
<spaceone>	is there a fast way to produce a segfault? (for testing purposes) → best would be without compiling
<xeon-enouf>	in /dev/disk/by-path  #which are just symlinks udev creates/uses
<k_sze[work]>	xeon-enouf: but I'm trying the exact same thing, except with my RAID volume, but it's not working.
<xeon-enouf>	well, if it's a hardware raid, as i think you mentioned, it has it's own BIOS and everything
<Penguin>	xeon-enouf: its own
*	xeon-enouf snuggles the sugarplum Penguin 
<xeon-enouf>	k_sze[work]: what are you trying to do? and which module are you using megaraid?
<xeon-enouf>	oh Adaptec; so aac*
<k_sze[work]>	xeon-enouf: Adaptec 6405E
<k_sze[work]>	yeah
<xeon-enouf>	modinfo aacraid
<k_sze[work]>	I'm trying to write a udev rule so that there's always a /dev/my-raid symlink.
<xeon-enouf>	lspci -nn will show you the matching possible aliases
<xeon-enouf>	oh, ok - hrm
<k_sze[work]>	I can see in /dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:02:00.0-scsi-0:0:0:0-part1 -> ../../sdb1
<xeon-enouf>	yeah, so /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/*  perhaps has info?
<emperiz>	spaceone: As far as I know, you can send signals to processes using "kill". SIGSEGV should be the one you're looking for.
<xeon-enouf>	that too
<k_sze[work]>	oops
<k_sze[work]>	anyway
<k_sze[work]>	I have host0 to host5 under /sys/class/scsi_host
<k_sze[work]>	What I don't understand is, why doesn't a rule like SUBSYSTEM=="block", ENV{ID_PATH}=="pci-0000:02:00.0-scsi-0:0:0:0-part1", SYMLINK+="my-raid" work
<spaceone>	emperiz: yes, i just found also http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2045314/why-cant-i-cause-a-seg-fault
<spaceone>	thanks
<xeon-enouf>	k_sze[work]: it seems it should.. missing one or two things? like.. hrm.. did you --reload-rules?
<k_sze[work]>	I even rebooted.
<k_sze[work]>	For what it's worth, a rule like SUBSYSTEM=="block", ENV{ID_CDROM}=="?*", ENV{ID_PATH}=="pci-0000:00:1f.2-scsi-2:0:0:0", SYMLINK+="cdrom", ENV{GENERATED}="1" is clearly working here.
<xeon-enouf>	this could get ugly, but grep . /sys/class/scsi_*/*/*   #heh
<xeon-enouf>	no need to reboot, IIUC  the udevadm control --reload-rules
<xeon-enouf>	k_sze[work]: subsystem = class perhaps?
<xeon-enouf>	k_sze[work]: or other? just ls /sys  (for list of SUBSYSTEM==) ?
<k_sze[work]>	block  bus  class  dev  devices  firmware  fs  hypervisor  kernel  module  power
<xeon-enouf>	k_sze[work]: do your devices exist anywhere under /sys/block/ ?
<Filystyn>	guys how do i download a char set?
<xeon-enouf>	Filystyn: perhaps you want locales?
<Filystyn>	well yes
<xeon-enouf>	install locales-all pkg? #or one of them?
<Filystyn>	niiice
<k_sze[work]>	xeon-enouf: /sys/block/sdb -> ../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1c.3/0000:02:00.0/host0/target0:0:0/0:0:0:0/block/sdb
<k_sze[work]>	and under /sys/block/sdb, there is sdb1
<xeon-enouf>	k_sze[work]: looking at output of a grep -r SUBSYSTEM /etc/udev/
<xeon-enouf>	i see ACTION== and DRIVERS==
<xeon-enouf>	ahh
<xeon-enouf>	ACTION=="add"  for my eth0 nic
<Filystyn>	ok nice but
<xeon-enouf>	SUBSYSTEM=="net" ; DRIVERS=="?*"  ;
<Filystyn>	i want for example charset R8
<Filystyn>	how do i get it i want fucking all not only utf8
<xeon-enouf>	ahh in hdparm.rules k_sze[work] i see KERNEL=="[sh]d[az]" RUN+="/etc/init.d/hdparm hotplug"
<xeon-enouf>	gr8 ?
<k_sze[work]>	I have *very* few udev rules on my system
<xeon-enouf>	gr8 d8 4 a m8?
<k_sze[work]>	like 6
<m8>	:o
<xeon-enouf>	k_sze[work]: yea; i'm winging it here; i never got good at adding/creating udev rules... and now.. systemd monster
<C0MPAQ>	I must say, the "Flash is outdated and deactivated" stuff is quite handy in firefox
<C0MPAQ>	flash won't hog my resources
<C0MPAQ>	and I can just activate it
<Filystyn>	i want for example charsets:  JIS_C62291984B, JOHAB, JP-OCR-B, JP, JS, JUS_I.B1.002, KOI-7, KOI-8, KOI8-R, how to get those?
<peetaur2>	I find NoScript is enough to block flash
<C0MPAQ>	peetaur2: can noscript do the same?
<C0MPAQ>	peetaur2: it is nonsense to block JS by default
<peetaur2>	C0MPAQ: by default it replaces all flash with an icon you have to click and then confirm "yes" to let flash run
<xeon-enouf>	cafuego.net/2007/11/11/time-machine-kinda  #try something like there k_sze[work]
<C0MPAQ>	peetaur2: oh ok, that's nice
<peetaur2>	and it's not nonsense at all to block JS like noscript does it... more work sure, but it's fine when you get used to it.
<C0MPAQ>	peetaur2: per plugin container, or per site?
<peetaur2>	I think you can tell it to always allow a site if you want
<peetaur2>	and I think the click+confirm is only that site
<C0MPAQ>	peetaur2: I had it on for a day, virtually all pages that relie on JS didn't work, then disabled
<xeon-enouf>	Filystyn: grep NLS /boot/config-$(uname -r)  #see if those are as modules; then modprobe each
<peetaur2>	hehe yes, you had a short bad experience :D
<xeon-enouf>	Filystyn: modinfo nls_     #hit TAB a few times
<peetaur2>	but you can appreciate the benefit right? you can enable just a few sites adn have a site work without all the bitcoin mining JS in the background eating your resources since you can select specific things to allow, not globally allow (exaggerating about bitcoin of course)
<C0MPAQ>	peetaur2: I have to actually use the Internet for work, I can't have a partially functioning browser
<C0MPAQ>	JS is a big mess
<xeon-enouf>	Filystyn: if they say =m  they are modules you can modprobe to provide support
<C0MPAQ>	one thingy doesn't work, it doesn't display something particular, you spent an hour searching for it
<vin-ivar>	i'm back again
<C0MPAQ>	just too crazytt
<Filystyn>	lol
<Filystyn>	this is like
<spreeuw>	java shit
<Filystyn>	nothing
<peetaur2>	I find NoScript very manageable... and if you give up for a while just enable globally and try again tomorrow; you will get used to it and like it if you give it a chance
<peetaur2>	my wife also uses NoScript, and she doesn't mind
<spreeuw>	yes I use noscript also
<vin-ivar>	with odder problems every time
<spreeuw>	cant browse without
<spreeuw>	and adserver dns blocks
<vin-ivar>	actually wait
<spreeuw>	also for usual spyware like twitter google and facebook
<C0MPAQ>	peetaur2: it is 1: too much effort, 2: silently defective
<Filystyn>	and some of them are not even listed
<IP92>	how should I resolve this http://pastebin.com/udD6Kzes
<C0MPAQ>	peetaur2: if you could at least tell the defects for certain, if they occur
<C0MPAQ>	peetaur2: but if you can't it is unusable
<Filystyn>	so basicly linux is utf-8 friendly and othere charsets unfriendly ?
<peetaur2>	it's not silent... by default it has a popup status bar line ... and I prefer to disable that and have the icon on the url bar intsead (which is red when something is blocked)
<Filystyn>	i can understand that but
<Filystyn>	when i listed all existing
<C0MPAQ>	peetaur2: maybe they could bind JS to user events, so that after each keystroke or mouseclick it times out after 1 second or XY CPU cycles
<Filystyn>	and now your telling me  like 95% or more can not be used ;(
<C0MPAQ>	peetaur2: that would make sense I agree with
<peetaur2>	C0MPAQ: I wouldn't want it to choose defects for me... I'll decide if I want a feature to work or not, and enable more scripts if necessary
<Filystyn>	is there some distro that has like all char sets?
<Filystyn>	but i mean it all
<peetaur2>	C0MPAQ: you mean a cpu time limit on every javascript file multiplied by keystrokes or something? that would be interesting for resource limiting, but wouldn't fight malware well
<Filystyn>	ill go on debian simply and cry there
<C0MPAQ>	peetaur2: you don't understand what I mean ... when a website uses JS and you disable it, that causes potentially everything that interacts with the JS to be defective. That, in a manner which you are unable to tell apart from how the website functions with just HTML
<thms>	xeon-enouf: so how does it differ from a symlink ?
<thms>	a symlink is a file with it's own inode ?
<metaspike>	IP92, does apt-get update'
<peetaur2>	C0MPAQ: yes that's what I thought... a site has some parts broken if you disable JS, and still some parts broken if you enable a bit; and I like that fine
<metaspike>	apt-get update resolve it,
<C0MPAQ>	peetaur2: it could be a div not loading, or a search result getting weird, or a false redirect, anything
<peetaur2>	yes and you can't know for sure if defects are caused by the block, unless you unblock it all to test
<IP92>	metaspike: no, but  sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/* -vf resolved it
<metaspike>	cool, thanks for sharing
<peetaur2>	but use it for a while and it's perfectly comfortable to know some things don't work sometimes, and are only annoying if you can't submit a form usually
<peetaur2>	(unblocking reloads the page which clears the form :P)
<C0MPAQ>	Lazarus form saver
<peetaur2>	yes I have used that and like it, but I don't often need it, so haven't installed it this time
<peetaur2>	(yet)
<C0MPAQ>	doesn't work with AJAX forms unfortunately
<C0MPAQ>	AJAX forms are the biggest nonsense
<Furah>	This the correct channel for Linux-related issues?
<vin-ivar>	at certain zoom levels
<vin-ivar>	Github displays their default font as monospace
<vin-ivar>	an ugly monospace
<metaspike>	Furah, appearances aside - yes :)
<peetaur2>	AJAX is okay for some things, like picking country before it populates the state/province list
<C0MPAQ>	"oh, text fields come with HTML! Let's just reimplement that in Javascript instead!"
<peetaur2>	but pure javascript anything is just stupid (no js = blank page means your devs are retarded :P)
<vin-ivar>	it's their own font
<xeon-enouf>	thms: a symlink is a file, whereas a hardlink is a dentry; the former can cross FSes/Volumes; hardlinks cannot, since inode numbers would get all askewed (one set of inum for each FS)
<vin-ivar>	not one from my PC
<C0MPAQ>	peetaur2: JS is the way to go
<peetaur2>	JS means code I have not audited is running on my machine... that's a no go
<peetaur2>	:P
<C0MPAQ>	we no longer have just websites, but webapps
<C0MPAQ>	more and more program stuff will move into the browser
<peetaur2>	speak for yoruself... I avoid the "webapp" type pages
<C0MPAQ>	look 20 years ago, you just had styled text pages
<C0MPAQ>	now you have UIs
<C0MPAQ>	just how it is
<C0MPAQ>	use a VM with X11 over SSH
<C0MPAQ>	if you are concerned with malware
<Furah>	Well I have a bit of a doozy. I cannot get WiFi working, and don't have access to a wired connection. I've connected to the network via netctl/wifi-menu, and have an IP address. However, I cannot ping anything besides my own IP address and 127.0.0.1, nor can I access the internet. Googling the issue hasn't yielded any success.
<peetaur2>	C0MPAQ: and apparmor :)
<peetaur2>	C0MPAQ: I'm not paranoid... just I don't see that it is sane to run such JS while viewing random sites
<metaspike>	Furah, what distro of linux are you using
<Furah>	Archlinux.
<metaspike>	been through the wiki page? https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wireless_network_configuration
<Furah>	I have (Arch Wiki is my go-to site), but their only solution is if you've not been assigned an IP.
<xeon-enouf>	thms: yes, a symlink has it's own inode, inumber; ls -li `which rename`
<Penguin>	xeon-enouf: its own
<xeon-enouf>	it's
<xeon-enouf>	it's a tit :-P
<Furah>	The grammatical correct usage would be its, it's is 'it is', and not 'it owns'.
<metaspike>	Furah, you've been assigned an IP address- but is it a legitmate IP address? if authentication fails, i've seen linux assign a bogus one
*	suresh is now known as Guest645
<Furah>	How do I check that my IP is legitimate?
<metaspike>	ip addr
<irgendwer4711>	hi, where to look for rejected code patches journal for the kernel?
<peetaur2>	Furah: you should use a private network  address https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network
<peetaur2>	Furah: but anything you set will work, as long as all the devices have a consistent subnet (network address, which is the address after applying the subnet mask)
<eirirs>	10/8 , 172.16/12 and 192.168/16
<xeon-enouf>	Furah: perhaps you'd like to talk the bot known as Penguin in private more often
<metaspike>	a bad one will probably start with 169, you might be able to get one with dhclient [myadpater], or just assign like peetaur says, best to start at the router level
<metaspike>	find out what the correct subname is and just statically assign one, could work
<eirirs>	I've seen government departement using 169 addresses for local comm :S
<metaspike>	subdomain*  eg 192.168.1.x
<eirirs>	server/clients
<eirirs>	I were like WTF
<Furah>	I just remembered that my phone has a networking app on it, and my computer does show up, and is successfully pinged.
<metaspike>	ffs
<metaspike>	:s
<metaspike>	what's the IP?
<Furah>	192.168.1.13
<metaspike>	that's fine
<peetaur2>	Furah: and same mask and 192.168.1.x on every device?
<Furah>	Yes.
<stangeland>	Shouldn't it be possible to make a symlink inside /usr/bin which references a binary located elsewhere like in /home/myname/stuffa ?
<eirirs>	hai mr. stangeland. greetings from mr. stangeland
<eirirs>	stangeland: and, yes it's possible
<eirirs>	as long as that in /home have sufficent permissions so other users can run it
<stangeland>	eirirs, i see :) ok...
<stangeland>	eirirs,but if i try and run it i ust get command not found
<eirirs>	stangeland: did you run with ./ ?
<stangeland>	eirirs, ls /usr/bin/procrunner exists, but i cannot just write procrunner and execute it
*	jeffree is now known as Zero_Charisma
<stangeland>	eirirs, no i did not because its not in current path
<stangeland>	its in /usr/bin as i said
*	Zero_Charisma is now known as jeffree
<eirirs>	so you ran with full path
<stangeland>	eirirs, i did procrunner
<eirirs>	and still it said command not found?
<stangeland>	thats it
<stangeland>	no, not full path
<eirirs>	did you run ls too?
<stangeland>	just $procrunner
<stangeland>	ls ? that just list the files - yeah its there
<limbo>	stangeland: check that $PATH has /usr/bin in it
<stangeland>	it does ....../usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:..........
<eirirs>	stangeland: are you using "" or  '' ?
<stangeland>	no
<kaushal>	Hi
<kaushal>	Is there a way for non-root processes to bind to “privileged” ports for example port 80 on linux?
<limbo>	kaushal: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/413807/is-there-a-way-for-non-root-processes-to-bind-to-privileged-ports-1024-on-l
<peetaur2>	heh the url has his question almost word for word
*	peetaur2 suspects someone didn't duckduckgo or startpage the question
<stangeland>	Shouldn't it be possible to make a symlink inside /usr/bin which references a binary located elsewhere like in /home/myname/stuffa ?
<limbo>	peetaur2: that was kinda intentional from my part :P
<peetaur2>	stangeland: yes but ideally you should use /usr/local/bin for things not installed by the package manager.  man hier
<jpcooper>	hello
<jpcooper>	does anyone know the simplest way to limit how long a gnu parallel job runs?
<jpcooper>	that is, total running time
<peetaur2>	sleep $time; cd /proc/; killl -9 *              (don't run that; ;) typo intentional)
<stangeland>	peetaur2, ahhh ok...good point. However when i try and run it $procrunner i just get command not found
<peetaur2>	stangeland: sometimes /usr/local/bin/ isn't in PATH, so you should add it
<jpcooper>	peetaur2: thanks peetaur2
<peetaur2>	jpcooper: in case you took me too literally, make sure not to kill everything... use something like & and then $! to find the right pid
<peetaur2>	I never tried parallel ... I just use & and manage the pids in arrays and stuff
<jpcooper>	yeah, I got that
<stangeland>	peetaur2, it is. this is my path: http://paste.ubuntu.com/10938875/
<peetaur2>	and file based IPC :)
<jpcooper>	peetaur2: I just found out about http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/timeout-invocation.html . Seems more suitable
<peetaur2>	stangeland: yes it's in there... is the file executable?
<stangeland>	peetaur2, its just a symlink
<stangeland>	peetaur2, can symlinks be executable ?
<peetaur2>	stangeland: no but check the target
<thms>	xeon-enouf: thanks for you explanation about hard/symlinks
<kaushal>	limbo: I am not sure if i understand "setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /path/to/program"?
<kaushal>	what does +ep mean
<kaushal>	as per the link provided
<kaushal>	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/413807/is-there-a-way-for-non-root-processes-to-bind-to-privileged-ports-1024-on-l
<stangeland>	peetaur2, ahh yeah i think it was a dangling link :)
<limbo>	kaushal: e = effective, p = permitted, i = inheritable
<thms>	kaushal: I assume permitted from http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html
<thms>	ho, limbo was faster than me
<thms>	limbo: I've a question
<thms>	I done man "setcap"
<limbo>	thms: thats a very small manpage
<thms>	in the see also section I see
<thms>	 cap_set_file(3)
<thms>	but when I run man 3 cap_set_file
<thms>	says there is no manpage for this
<thms>	"No manual entry for cap_set_file in section 3
<limbo>	thms: http://linux.die.net/man/3/cap_set_file is the manpage at least
<thms>	limbo: yes sure but am I missing a package or something ?
<limbo>	I'm not all that into the man3 pages for that stuff since I never coded stuff using the capabilities stuff :)
<limbo>	thms: libcap-dev
<limbo>	thms: most likely provides them
<thms>	ho, ok
<limbo>	normally the .h files come with dev packages, and so do their manpages :)
<thms>	nope, no luck with libcap-dev
<limbo>	for ubuntu it is that package at least
<thms>	but I didn't know you only have the manpages of package installed.
<thms>	I use ubuntu; installed libcap-dev and still no luck
<thms>	it works for you ?
<limbo>	http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/saucy/man3/cap_get_file.3.html
<limbo>	I don't run ubuntu :D
<limbo>	I'm on OSX on my workstation, and don't wanna install it on any of the servers I'm working on right now
<thms>	limbo: thanks for the link, they are liars!
<limbo>	thms: it worked for me
<thms>	limbo: did you see this: https://threatpost.com/bypassing-os-x-security-tools-is-trivial-researcher-says/112410
<limbo>	thms: I spun up a vagrant vps and installed libcap-dev
<thms>	15.04 ?
<limbo>	14.04.2 LTS
<thms>	ok may be missing in 15.04 :)
<thms>	I need to get into Vagrant
<thms>	the way you did this so fast is amazing me.
<limbo>	thms: dpkg -L libcap-dev
<limbo>	thms: provisioning a new vagrant machine takes longer, but I had a lab one I dont need any more, was fast to just boot it :)
<thms>	hooooo, libPcap I installed.
<thms>	indeed, it works. :)
<limbo>	thms: haha, thats not the right stuff no :) but awesome for sniffing networks! :)
<thms>	yup
<thms>	limbo: may I ask your age ?
<limbo>	thms: born in 1981
<thms>	OKOK
<thms>	I always feel bad when I see people awesome like you and wonder if they are younger / same age as me p
<limbo>	and I did my first install of linux in 1994 or so :)
<thms>	'92 here
<thms>	First install was Debian Sarge
<eirirs>	:)
<eirirs>	redhat 5.2 here
<Psi-Jack>	Heh. I got you both beat. :p
<thms>	so 2005
<limbo>	thms: 1998 I switched to FreeBSD, and then around 2004 or so I came back to using both BSD and Linux :)
<thms>	I assume it's BSD that made you so awesome
<limbo>	haha, BSD did very little hand holding :)
<thms>	tried it, really makes you know what you do
<limbo>	but so did linux back then
<Psi-Jack>	I started with Linux 0.99plX
<thms>	I always stuck with Debian / ubuntu, tried Gentoo
<limbo>	nowdays lots of people are running linux but all they did was press next on an installer
<blind>	lol
<thms>	Gentoo was awesome tbh
<Psi-Jack>	Bleh.
<Psi-Jack>	Gentoo was a great idea, until it wasn;t.
<Pessimist>	atleast it doesn't force systemd garbage on you
<Psi-Jack>	I love systemd.
<Psi-Jack>	The fact you can't even install systemd on gentoo pisses me off.
<Pessimist>	I didn't have you in mind
<Pessimist>	You can :)
<Psi-Jack>	So, forcing you NOT to have it.
<Psi-Jack>	You can, but it breaks so many things it's not even funny.
<Psi-Jack>	It's broken by their own design. Hence it's hard masked.
<thms>	limbo: what BSD should I install ?
<flughafen>	i have a problem with alpine not using the terminal colors I set in xdefaults.
<thms>	I was thinking openBSD or netBSD
<jelly>	Psi-Jack: it takes a LOT of work to integrate systemd into a distro
<Psi-Jack>	thms: Off-topic in ##linux
<Psi-Jack>	jelly: Yep. I know.
<thms>	Psi-Jack: ho, yeah.
<jelly>	Psi-Jack: so why are you pissed off at someone not doing lots of work?
<imsc>	hello guys.. i need your help.. i have killed a process with "kill -9 <pid>" but the PID was not the right one and i have killed wrong pid.. is there any way we can find the relative details of that particular pid which i have killed?
<peetaur2>	Psi-Jack: you make gentoo sound great
<Psi-Jack>	jelly: I'm not, Gentoo clearly states they don't support it. :p
<peetaur2>	the people must give a sh*t about their users
<imsc>	i am using rhel6.3
<Psi-Jack>	imsc: I'm sorry to hear that. You should upgrade to RHEL 6.6
<peetaur2>	unlike a Debian distro I heard of called Debian
<jelly>	peetaur2: yeah, how dare they CHANGE THINGS
<peetaur2>	heh yeah why would you use .3 if .6 is available?
<Psi-Jack>	peetaur2: Heh. Funny thing. I hate Debian, but I have met Ian Murdock once.
<peetaur2>	change things despite overwhelming rejection by the users
<jelly>	peetaur2: no such thing has taken place
<peetaur2>	you don't know about it, therefore it didn't happen. Sound logic. :)
<AF04FB9290474265>	Anyone aware how to forbid all root userland processes but init on the kernel level?
<jelly>	peetaur2: no, I'm just comparing the number of happy and unhappy users in #debian and #debianfork
<AF04FB9290474265>	Any patches?
<Psi-Jack>	AF04FB9290474265: What is your actual goal?
<jelly>	peetaur2: there has been a small number of loud users, not a large or overwhelming number of medium-noisy users.
<Psi-Jack>	And why does your nick suck SO freaking much?
<peetaur2>	anyone talking about how much they hate being forced to use systemd in #debian was thrown out, and that is why #debianfork was created.
<AF04FB9290474265>	To forbid any userland root-owned processes to appear after init
<eirirs>	hex nick? heh
<Psi-Jack>	...
<jelly>	peetaur2: probably because they're not forced.  I'm running jessie w/ sysvinit.
<Psi-Jack>	AF04FB9290474265: There is nothing that can do that.
<peetaur2>	force is force
*	iflema is still rolling with systemd on gentoo
<jelly>	peetaur2: so yes, loud complaining about things that aren't true, got some people banned
<peetaur2>	how is a regular user going to replace such a nested tightly coupled system? they won't. They'll give up, and fall back to what they were forced to use.
<AF04FB9290474265>	Psi-Jack, Just wanted to ask if there are any ready patches somewhere, or should it be done by my self
<AF04FB9290474265>	iflema, Use EPOCH
<jelly>	peetaur2: force is useful, applied properly
<jelly>	just ask Psi-Jack
*	Psi-Jack flexes his muscles.
<peetaur2>	force against people who are not your property is unjustified
<AF04FB9290474265>	peetaur2, I assume everything is my property by default
<Psi-Jack>	Red Hat used force to get gcc on the right track once. What happened? People finally started moving forwards.
<jelly>	peetaur2: disclosure: as an op in #debian, it's my duty to keep the channel usable for the other 1500 people, that sometimes means the one rehashing old, partially true, partially false arguments, sometimes get shown the door
<Psi-Jack>	jelly: Heh, you're an op of #debian? Nice to know.
<jelly>	peetaur2: actual users not willing to experiment with systemd just go and read the release notes, follow the instructions and continue not using it
<jelly>	those that try to stir shit up... get the short end of the stick
<iflema>	AF04FB9290474265 for wat
<Psi-Jack>	Yep. #debian people are pretty liberal for the msot part.
<AF04FB9290474265>	iflema, FOR TEH POWA!
<peetaur2>	old liberal (libre) or liberal (follow whatever political agenda is hot today)?
<Psi-Jack>	iflema: Obviously, AF04FB9290474265... Is a strange cookie. I'd stay away from such odd cookies.
<iflema>	good for a laugh
<Psi-Jack>	I'm sure that'll pass, too.
*	Samuel_Najdowski is now known as noob
*	iflema passes to the left
<watmm>	I have a mirrored /etc/php5 and /etc/nginx on two servers, and have enabled pm.status_path. When i visit the status page the response headers from a varnish cache tell me i've hit server 2, yet i always see the fpm processes of server 1. Any ideas?
<Psi-Jack>	watmm: How is nginx setup to utilize fpm?
<Psi-Jack>	And also... Check your logs. :p
<xdexter>	Hello, how to convert files with invalid encoding filename? Ex: "DECLARA\?\?O.doc to DECLARAÇÃO.DOC"?
<Wulf>	xdexter: mv
<Psi-Jack>	xdexter: There's nothing invalid about that.
<xdexter>	Wulf, Yes, but I have thousands of files ...
<Wulf>	xdexter: have fun
<Psi-Jack>	Indeed, have fun.
<xdexter>	convmv ?
<Wulf>	xdexter: next time, don't damage your file names in the first place
<watmm>	Psi-Jack: How do you mean "how is it set up"?
<Psi-Jack>	watmm: I mean exactly what I said.
<xdexter>	Wulf, convmv no?
<Wulf>	xdexter: what would that be?
<xdexter>	Wulf, https://www.j3e.de/linux/convmv/man/
<Wulf>	xdexter: how would a program know if ? means Ç or Ã or ¶ etc.
<xdexter>	Wulf, I thought so ...
<watmm>	Psi-Jack: But what specifically?
<xdexter>	Wulf, ok, thank you
<Psi-Jack>	...
<Psi-Jack>	watmm: Good luck.
<watmm>	I don't do general questions.
<Psi-Jack>	I don't help vague people that can't understand English.
<Psi-Jack>	So, as I said, good luck.
<bosnjak>	here's a puzzling question. I have two laptops, both running xubuntu, on the same WiFi network. I want to copy a big amount of files from one to another (50GB). To get bigger speed I connected them via Ethernet cable, and manually configured the network so they both have additional IP's for wired connection, and they can ping each other. Now, when I start copying files (using samba), the copy goes over WiFi interface. How can I make it use the wire
<bosnjak>	d interface (without disconnecting from the WiFi)?
<Psi-Jack>	bosnjak: Re-configure samba to only bind to the ethernet.
<Psi-Jack>	Those things communicate and broadcast by multicast, so they're broadcasting, currently, over wifi.
<Psi-Jack>	Or... Disconnect Wifi, and not have to reconfigure anything,. :p
<Psi-Jack>	Or... Stop using samba, and use alternatives like scp.
<bosnjak>	Psi-Jack: hm, disconnecting WiFi is the easiest, but it's not the solution the little geek in me wants :D Anyway, scp seems like a very good alternative, since I'm not sure where to start with configuring sambe
<bosnjak>	s/sambe/samba
<Psi-Jack>	scp will be slower, though. :p
<bosnjak>	why?
<Psi-Jack>	Encryption
<bosnjak>	right
<bosnjak>	I'll google for samba config a bit to check it out
<Psi-Jack>	The difference in speed will easily be, depending on network speed overall of course, 50MB/s to as low as 5MB/s
<bosnjak>	wow
<bosnjak>	that's huge
<Psi-Jack>	Yes. Yes it is.
<Psi-Jack>	rsync, for some stupid reason, can be even worse.
<bosnjak>	that makes me wonder, why is the default for network sharing in Linux samba? Since that's an implementation of  Windows sharing standard afaik?
<Psi-Jack>	It's not?
<mAniAk-_->	bosnjak: nfs
<Psi-Jack>	But, CIFS is definitely a faster protocol, since it itself doesn't actually encrypt. NFSv3 is slower than CIFS, NFSv4 is comparable.
<bosnjak>	hm, I installed Xubuntu clean, and in Thunar I can only see samba shares
<mAniAk-_->	though to just transfer files i would use sftp
<bosnjak>	mAniAk-_-: I need SSH server on the target machine, right?
<mAniAk-_->	bosnjak: yes
<Psi-Jack>	sftp basically has the same slowdowns as scp would have.
<surs>	How can I detect a memory card in a usb card reader
<Psi-Jack>	surs: Plug one in.
<bosnjak>	Psi-Jack: how do I copy the files using CIFS?
<Psi-Jack>	bosnjak: Samba == CIFS. :p
<surs>	dmesg / lsusb only show me the different slots, not the actual card
<bosnjak>	surs: lsusb?
<bosnjak>	Psi-Jack: ah :D
<Psi-Jack>	bosnjak: The alternative to using CIFS over ethernet would be to access the shares by IP. instead of name.
<Psi-Jack>	So, smb://192.168.x.x/blah instead of smb://mycomputerA/
<bosnjak>	Psi-Jack: hm, good idea, let me try it... brb
<surs>	in fact, lsusb only shows the card reader, not even the slots
<Psi-Jack>	surs: And? This is normal. :p
<Psi-Jack>	Slots aren't controllers.
<janus_>	surs: lsblk or cat /proc/partitions
<surs>	I need to mount the card, I don't care so much about the slots, or the reader itself
<MrElendig>	surs: plug it in, post dmesg
<surs>	janus_: the slots all start with 'sg'. lsblk shows no block device starting with sg
<surs>	right away MrElendig
<kichuku>	in #kichuku
<Psi-Jack>	kichuku: Not that we care.
<Haris>	hello all
<kichuku>	Psi-Jack: that was a typo. sorry
<Haris>	can cp show progress info or speed info ?
<Psi-Jack>	Haris: No
<janus_>	surs: you can also have a tail on your syslog running in a corner :)
<surs>	http://pastebin.com/kpCEXC26 MrElendig
*	MrElendig can't open pastebin.com
<bosnjak>	Psi-Jack: yes, it is working. This is so simple and logical solution, that I feel stupid for not figuring it out.
<Haris>	I have a new hdd. a usb 3.0. wanted to check the speed of transfer of files/bytes
<bosnjak>	Psi-Jack: thanks :)
<Psi-Jack>	bosnjak: It took me a few minutes, still waking up, only 1st cup of coffee. LOL
<surs>	MrElendig: which paste bin can you open?
<MrElendig>	bpaste.net gist.github.cpm
<MrElendig>	com*
<MrElendig>	unlike pastebin.com they are not complete shit either :p
<Psi-Jack>	surs: And paste.linuxassist.net as noted in the topic. :)

<Psi-Jack>	Keeps bots out.
<MrElendig>	except it doesn't really
<Psi-Jack>	Doesn't require captcha to view. :p
<Psi-Jack>	It does.
<Psi-Jack>	I run the very same stikked paste site on paste.linux-help.org, never bots.
<MrElendig>	surs: just mount sdi
<MrElendig>	or whatever
<MrElendig>	what a silly card reader
<surs>	hm
<MrElendig>	what type of card are you using?

<BluesKaj>	Howdy folks
<baxx>	Psi-Jack: just tested that, nope. I'm guessing I'll have to delete the synlinks then move them all from the directory? then symlink them somewhere else.
<Psi-Jack>	baxx: rm removes symlinks.
<Psi-Jack>	Simple as that.
<Psi-Jack>	If you want to /replace/ a symlink with the file it points to you have to do that in addition to rm. :p

<Psi-Jack>	No magic.

<thms>	Why does virtualization solve many drivers issues ?
<thms>	(it's a question from an assignment, I graduated, but I don't know the answer so I feel like an idiot)
<Psi-Jack>	thms: It.. Doesn't?
<SkunkyFone>	thms: a virtualized "machine" uses the same standard "hardware" every time... so if you write a driver for the virtualized machine, it's always the same hardware you're writing for...
<Psi-Jack>	But it does technically reduce the amount of possible drivers needed, by only virtualizing as a few specific devices.
<thms>	that's what I was thinking.
<SkunkyFone>	thms: that assumes that whatever you're using to virtualize your hardware does a decent job of what it's supposed to do... passing off the problem to a different place is all.
<thms>	So nothing to do with the virtualization itself, just the virtual device drivers ?
<Psi-Jack>	Not really "solving" the issue so much, since we have things like virtio, lsi-scsi, etc.. Still a set amount of devices overall. virtio being the most specific.
<triceratux>	the virtualisation layer can use the notion the host os has of how the drivers are installed, which tends to be better than that presented by an arbitrary guest os
<thms>	triceratux, SkunkyFone, so when you virtualize it uses the host's drivers ?
<Psi-Jack>	In the end result, yes.
<thms>	interesting.
<Psi-Jack>	virtualizing hardware to the guest OS ultimately gets translated back to the host.
<thms>	I get it now. :)
<Psi-Jack>	Emulated, per-se, unless using virtio or similar paravirtualization.
<thms>	thanks !
<Psi-Jack>	Emulation of course is a bit slower, while paravirtualization is faster, but requires guest support for it to be used.
<Psi-Jack>	Hence: It doesn't really "solve" the problem. It's technically a bogus question.
<thms>	Psi-Jack: is VMWare paravirtualization or emulation ?
<Psi-Jack>	VMWare has both.
<thms>	gah, and Oracle ?
<thms>	I have a hard time making the difference
<Psi-Jack>	One emulates hardware, one paravirtualizes, which requires vmware guest "additions" to be installed on the guest to utilize.
<thms>	Oracle Virtual Box.
<thms>	ho.. ok. VirtualBox does the same too then.
<Psi-Jack>	VirtualBox has /some/ paravirtualization, but not much.
<thms>	and it is those "guest additions tools" that "solve" the driver problems ?
<Psi-Jack>	VirtualBox doesn't paravirtualize the more critical things, like network devices and hard disk devices.
<Psi-Jack>	thms: No.
<Psi-Jack>	Those are what re-adds the "driver problems" in the first place, back into virtualization. :p
<Psi-Jack>	Hence: Bogus question.
<thms>	Psi-Jack: thanks.

<baxx>	Penguin: i wasn't in that directory, i'll try it from outside both though.
<baxx>	Penguin: so running that command from ~/ it still makes that loop... i thought that I was just telling it to link ~/DOTTEST/vimTEST/after to ~/.vimTEST/after

<baxx>	Penguin: yeah I'm sure it's something daft on my part. Running this from home still creates that aftera dir loop; ln -s ~/DOTTEST/vimTEST/after ~/.vimTEST/after

<Psi-Jack>	VeiledSpectre: What is that "specific reason" you want to use an insecure simple password?

<Psi-Jack>	(note, you could sudo to root and run passwd <username>" and it'll override it. UNless it's LDAP.

<VeiledSpectre>	Psi-Jack: A build script needs to use super user access to the system for its build activities and the password is hardcoded into the script... it is more effort to change the script than my password...

<peetaur2>	but I doubt you can find an off button for cache... maybe just some limits and other stuff, but not totally off without kernel compiling
<Arven>	peetaur2: the main thing I'm trying to discover is whether cache can actually be freed past a certain point (to make way for actual processes)
<Arven>	it seems that at around 7.5M of "slabs", nothing is freed, even though the vast majority is indeed dentry/inode
<webstrand>	With readonly, is that just a bash utility, or does the kernel prevent modification of environmental variables? I want to prevent any modification to my PATH after I set it initially.

<Arven>	peetaur2: that's completely up to the vfs cache pressure according to documentation, but even that seems like it doesn't affect anything
<VeiledSpectre>	Thank you for your help Psi-Jack and peetaur2
<oehansen>	yawn
<UukGoblin>	http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/121345254089 <- not supported, is it?
<compdoc>	going to record secuirty cams?
*	eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee is now known as eeee
<UukGoblin>	yeh
<compdoc>	I use ip cams. no need for cards, ect
<VeiledSpectre>	It worked.  As for your recommendation Psi-Jack :   Ive tried before... Many times... it is just no longer worth the frustration...
<UukGoblin>	compdoc, yeah, but they're expensive
<compdoc>	less than $150 each
<UukGoblin>	so if you want a hundred of them... that's $15k
<compdoc>	heh, if you need a hundred of them, then you could afford that
<Psi-Jack>	VeiledSpectre: Remove frustration by not giving a damn until the actual core problem is solved. :)
<peetaur2>	VeiledSpectre: did you end up getting sudo passwd to work? or a more low level approach like I suggested?
<UukGoblin>	compared to 6 such cards for 360 quid + 100 cheap ass weatherproof composite cameras at 1 quid each... total is less than 500 quid, 30x cheaper
<UukGoblin>	the only problem is finding out a cheap multi-channel PCI card that will work under linux :-D
<UukGoblin>	hopefully with hardware h.264 compression
<UukGoblin>	and configurable I-frame period
<webstrand>	Lets say a malicious user got access to my profile, say through firefox. Not having my password or a root password, all they can do is mess with my stuff. If they put this: https://gist.github.com/Timesquare/327b85e94d6e7e0a3f43 in my .profile, they can easily log my sudo password. Short of chown-ing my shell's rc files is there any way to prevent this?
*	eeee is now known as EriC^^
<UukGoblin>	webstrand, get rid of sudo, first of all
<webstrand>	UukGoblin: And su as well. I was hoping there was a better solution
<UukGoblin>	hmm, although this way... they might just as well steal your 'su' password, I'm afraid
<UukGoblin>	they can do that also by running a special X program
<EriC^^>	they can't see your password with that
<webstrand>	EriC^^: With my script? yes they can
<webstrand>	unless there's security settings i need to set
<UukGoblin>	although I think su/sudo should do some trickery to ensure the input is coming from a real terminal
<UukGoblin>	but an X keylogger would do the trick for sure
<webstrand>	UukGoblin: if you permit virtual terminals that's basically impossible
<UukGoblin>	I guess one way would be to ensure that you're always logging in as root from a dedicated console
<peetaur2>	webstrand: put firefox in apparmor, without write access anywhere except the firefox config and the download dir
<bls>	what threads are trying to defend against?
<bls>	threats
<EriC^^>	they can't see your password
<EriC^^>	also it's badly written
<peetaur2>	flash obviously ... where else can malware come from? ;)
<webstrand>	An application such as firefox interacts with a malicious webpage that escalates to shell access. OR the user runs a malicious script
<peetaur2>	and Javascript
<EriC^^>	they should use script -a to append and save it not to /tmp
<peetaur2>	webstrand: shell access is also impossible with a thing like apparmor... they can't exec any programs except what you whitelist
<bls>	noscript can prevent both those threats
<UukGoblin>	bls, no it can't
<peetaur2>	noscript protects very well, but not if you allow JS to make some non-working page work again
<UukGoblin>	bls, noscript won't secure against bugs in firefox...
<webstrand>	EriC^^: Care to qualify that any more? I ran the script to test it (putting it into .profile) and it works
<MetaNova>	UukGoblin: actually, yeah, it can
<UukGoblin>	besides, noscript is just a pain
<peetaur2>	it will protect you against many bugs exploitable by flash or scripts, which is mostly all
<MetaNova>	UukGoblin: no, it's not
<EriC^^>	webstrand: it saves the log of the session, but if you type sudo, and enter your pass, it won't be in the session
<MetaNova>	unless you're lazy
<peetaur2>	noscript is pain only until you have experience
<peetaur2>	or unlazy yes ;)
<webstrand>	EriC^^: do you see the tee before it?
<EriC^^>	webstrand: type script ~/sessionlog and when you're done type exit and cat ~/sessionlog
<UukGoblin>	MetaNova, well, not all of them, there can be firefox bugs outside of javascript
<UukGoblin>	yeah I'm too lazy to read every bit of obscured javascript on every page that requires it
<webstrand>	EriC^: The tee redirects stdin to script, which then sets isatty on the pipe going into the terminal
<UukGoblin>	webstrand, actually, other than apparmoring, I would consider running firefox as a separate user with a separate homedir
<EriC^^>	webstrand: no it doesn't
<peetaur2>	webstrand: so seriously, look up apparmor, selinux, or LSM in general... it is the general solution to adding very strong protection to anything (and IMO it should be on any network accessible app, as it is on my machines... especially Skype...)
<EriC^^>	tee directs it to the log's location,
<UukGoblin>	(although, again, X doesn't have enough control to combat a keylogger)
<EriC^^>	webstrand: also it's badly written and an improper use of tee
<EriC^^>	at least they could have used tee -a /tmp/sessionlog
<UukGoblin>	peetaur2, actually, the same X keylogging problem applies even when firefox is in apparmor
<peetaur2>	separate user is nothing compared to apparmor though... apparmor won't even let them execute things to try to change user again, to exploit other bugs on the system
<webstrand>	peetaur2: Alright
<peetaur2>	UukGoblin: they won't be able to modify his shell profile
<UukGoblin>	peetaur2, depends on how much permissions you give to that other user
*	Malsasa is now known as Guest99529
*	Malsasa_ is now known as Malsasa
<UukGoblin>	peetaur2, no, but they can steal passwords in other ways
<webstrand>	EricC^^: I wrote it, it's a proof of concept. tee -a would be necessarry if I were to actually use it, but i don't care too
<UukGoblin>	(i.e. an Xorg-based keylogger)
<peetaur2>	UukGoblin: not really.. there are always other ways, like back when pulseaudio was setuid root on distros instead of using capabilities, it was trivial to exploit it to turn off LSM and have full control
<peetaur2>	UukGoblin: but prevent them from running pulseaudio at all, and you're safe.... why should firefox run pulse? it should just use the libs, not the executable
<EriC^^>	webstrand: ok, then how come you think tee is "redirecting stdin"
<peetaur2>	(and why anyone would use pulse is another matter entirely :P)
*	peetaur2 goes home
<webstrand>	because it is: tee takes stdin and writes it to a file as well as to it's stdout.
<UukGoblin>	peetaur2, that other user definitely shouldn't have any access to any setuid binaries! :-)
<UukGoblin>	peetaur2, unfortunately, pulseaudio is about the only sensible way to get audio working via bluetooth AFAIK
<UukGoblin>	it may work via pure ALSA, not quite sure... but virtually no DE supports that
<EriC^^>	webstrand: anyways it could be written as script -qa ~/.session-log -c "bash -i"
<EriC^^>	that would be better
<EriC^^>	webstrand: no tee doesnt do that
<UukGoblin>	I actually think the main security hole there is Xorg
<webstrand>	peetaur2: The problem with app armor is that if the user has unrestricted sudo access (read trusted user) it is very onourous to require they cannot execute any file that's not whitelisted by app armor. I worry that such inconvenience could lead to lax security practices, such as running every script as sudo
<webstrand>	EriC^^: What does it do then?
<UukGoblin>	besides, there are always local root exploits that circumvent both apparmor and separate user permissions
<Fohlen>	webstrand: such a security practice sounds retarded.
<webstrand>	Fohlen: Can't trust the users, but the users must have the ability to modify the system at will :\. I just need to make sure the user is the one actually doing the modifying
<Fohlen>	webstrand: that's what ACL and sudo were created for
<Fohlen>	and letting them execute ALL within sudo is just your own stupidity
<EriC^^>	webstrand: it's writting the output of the script command
<EriC^^>	*writing
<EriC^^>	man script
<Arven>	what sorts of things are safe to allow from sudo?
<EriC^^>	script -q -c "bash -i" | tee /tmp/stdin_log would have done the same thing, and if you read man script, you'll see script takes an output file
<webstrand>	Arven: Only specifically vetted commands
<webstrand>	Fohlen: I'm assuming you're using linux right now. How do you have your sudoers file set up on your personal machine? For mine, I have unrestricted sudo, though in light of this discussion I may not soon.
<Fohlen>	webstrand: for my personal needs I share the same configuration
<Fohlen>	I pressumed setting up user accounts for machines with multiple users
<Fohlen>	or servers
<Arven>	You do need a fully unrestricted shell of some sort, if only a local console-only root login.
<webstrand>	It's a shared computer,  where each user is trusted.  But some of them aren't as savy as I am and may make mistakes. See the ubiquitous curl | sh
<webstrand>	Fohlen: Perhaps I can run each user in a container with a union mount.
<Fohlen>	webstrand: welcome in the world of chroot
<webstrand>	Fohlen: It's better than chroot. Cant escape from a container quite so easily

<MouseTheLuckyDog>	I have a basic problem: I often write small "utility" programs. For example I am logging steps in a script, function calls, return calls right now.  I am writing a script that seperats out the steps, one that matches function calls to return calls and a bunch of others. They are highly reusabke, Where should I store them?
<ayecee>	~/bin
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	aycee, but multiple usrs might use them.
<Penguin>	/usr/local/bin
<EriC^^>	/usr/local/bin
<bls>	MouseTheLuckyDog: then /usr/local/bin, man hier for the justification
<EriC^^>	1 sec
<EriC^^>	/usr/local/bin
<EriC^^>	holy.. i didn't use // and it wrote that
<EriC^^>	O.o
<Penguin>	/usr/local/bin
<Penguin>	like that?
<Penguin>	You must use irssi.
<EriC^^>	yeah, usually i have to type // to get it to escape it
<EriC^^>	no, i use xchat
<Penguin>	neat
<EriC^^>	it's escaping /nickserv though

<hid3>	Hello. Any ideas what options should I be looking at enabling in the Linux kernel for it to suport the "UUID" entries in /etc/fstab? This is on Intel architecture
<Penguin>	Why would you need to take special action for that to work?
<hid3>	I'm building a custom kernel
<Penguin>	Just put in something like   UUID=4234-2345-683467 /media/usb-1 noauto defaults 0 0
<Penguin>	and it should be fine.
<hid3>	Currently the only thing fails is the recognition of UUIDs in fstab
<Penguin>	Oh, interesting.
<hid3>	I'm asking about kernel options and not fstab entries
*	diego_ is now known as diegoviola
<ayecee>	hid3: does blkid show the uuids?
<Penguin>	It works with the same device and file system if you define the device node rather than UUID?
<phoenixz>	I have a 1TB drive with bad blocks, right now running 2efsck -f -y -c -c on that, ad from what I understand, these bad blocks should be marked as bad and no longer be used. BUT, I have a number of large files on that drive, which I want to copy but until now, because of those bad blocks, the copy failed. Will 2efsck fix those blocks in the files, or will these files still be using these bad blocks?
<RailRoadRunner>	phoenixz: e2fsck will try to fix those files and put stuff into /lost+found
<hid3>	ayecee: yes it does. The problem is only when booting/mounting. In fstab I've replaced it with the classic /dev/sda1, as well as in grub configuration and it boots OK
<phoenixz>	RailRoadRunner: you mean, the files having bad blocks will be moved to /lost+found? Or what would the "Stuff" be that is moved there?
<ayecee>	phoenixz: the files will no longer use those bad blocks, and the files will be damaged.
<phoenixz>	ayecee: Yeah, I figured that the files will be damaged, but at the very least I want to be able to copy the contents of the drive, but I cannot do that because of the bad blocks, mc keeps hanging
<RailRoadRunner>	phoenixz: e2fsck will try to save pieces of your files in /lost+found but no guarentee that you'll get everything back
<RailRoadRunner>	phoenixz: Is mc the same thing as dd?
<phoenixz>	RailRoadRunner: That's alright, just as long as I can copy the files that are not damaged, rightn now that is a pain in the ass
<phoenixz>	RailRoadRunner: mc: midnight commander
<ayecee>	RailRoadRunner: /lost+found is for files with no directory entry or damaged directory entry, not damaged files per se.
<phoenixz>	RailRoadRunner: dd would be for the entire drive, no? I want to only copy the files, not the entire drive
<RailRoadRunner>	phoenixz: Ah, OK.
<RailRoadRunner>	phoenixz: So something like rsync isn't working?
<ayecee>	if mc doesn't work, rsync wouldn't work either.
<phoenixz>	RailRoadRunner: but so, when this (frustratingly slow) e2fsck finishes, I should be able to copy the contents of the drive without mc hanging, stalling and breaking its neck over these bad blocks again, right?
<RailRoadRunner>	ayecee: I'm pretty sure rsync can ignore errors, no?
<ayecee>	no
<diegoviola>	nothing can ignore errors, right?
<phoenixz>	diegoviola: I can
<phoenixz>	diegoviola: dd also can, "conv=noerror"
<RailRoadRunner>	--ignore-errors (not quite the option I had in mind, but should work?)
<phoenixz>	RailRoadRunner: that would be for rsync, right?
<diegoviola>	phoenixz: I see
<fred1807>	I am looking for a simple alsamixer web gui *--*
<phoenixz>	That actually might be a good idea, over mc..
<RailRoadRunner>	phoenixz: Yes, but the description isn't quite what I was hoping: "delete even if there are I/O errors"
<ayecee>	phoenixz: were you getting errors in mc, or was it just hanging?
<RailRoadRunner>	phoenixz: I've had to do this before. Basically, you can at least rsync piecemeal. If rsync stops, you can ignore the one file it hangs on and proceed. It won't recopy the files it's previous copied.
<phoenixz>	RailRoadRunner: well.. it should not delete.. if at least it could leave a 0 bytes file name or something, at least I know something is wrong with the file, and at least I know that there was a file... over it just disappearing..
<phoenixz>	ayecee: it would hang for the longest time, then show IO error which I could "ignore all", but then it would say "delete partial file or not" and I could not do "all" on that so I have to stay here watch the progress, and its a 1TB drive, I have other things to do :D
<ayecee>	ok
<phoenixz>	RailRoadRunner: alrighty.. But, once 2efsck finishes, it should not again have these errors, right?
<RailRoadRunner>	phoenixz: In theory yes. Or at least hopefully fewer errors, since you're using the badblocks option.
<phoenixz>	Another question.. What happens if I suspend my laptop (gotta go home soon) and then wake up again.. will e2fsck continue working normally? Or can this process not be interrupted?
<ayecee>	should continue working normally
<RailRoadRunner>	ayecee: Really? I never knew that.
<RailRoadRunner>	phoenixz: I assume you're not creating a hibernation file on the drive in question and the drive is unmounted?
<phoenixz>	RailRoadRunner: No, just suspend to memory
<phoenixz>	And.. How trustworthy is a harddrive that is showing bad blocks like this?
<ayecee>	phoenixz: are you running e2fsck on a mounted filesystem?
<phoenixz>	ayecee: nope, unmounted
<baegle>	when I pipe stdout to /dev/null it seems like I lose the return code. Is this expected behavior? I can't find documentation that describes this behavior
<diegoviola>	I think Linux is the best OS/kernel ever, I can't see why Windows still have the majority userbase on the desktop
<ayecee>	ok
<RailRoadRunner>	phoenixz: If it works well after badblocks, it might be reliable... if it fails in new ways, bad.
<phoenixz>	ayecee: I want to imagine that 2efsck would not allow me to do that if it were mounted
<RailRoadRunner>	phoenixz: It will warn you, but you can still do it
<ayecee>	phoenixz: it complains, but it lets you if you insist
<RailRoadRunner>	beagleGuy: How are you checking the return value?
<phoenixz>	diegoviola: welcome to nearly every linux user our there...
<hassoon>	disappointing, havent found any competent pdf reader, so i chose to install adobe's
<phoenixz>	ayecee: Ah? I thought it would outright refuse because of the risk to corrupting your fs
<RailRoadRunner>	hassoon: You dislike evince and xpdf?
<hassoon>	though okular exists, but i don't want to download it's 100MB+ dependencies
<RailRoadRunner>	phoenixz: Unix lets you shoot yourself in the foot if you really want to :)
<hassoon>	RailRoadRunner: the first has problems with displaying pictures embeddeed in the pdf document, and the latter is so laggy
<phoenixz>	RailRoadRunner: Yeah, there is that philosophy :) Could have known
<baegle>	RailRoadRunner: Using the command in find with -execdir
<hassoon>	iceweasel can open pdf files onlin,e but the irony is that it does not open my local pdf files, it asks to download it instead
<RailRoadRunner>	baegle: OK, and how are you printing the return value? Remember the return value of "ls>/dev/null" is different from the return value of "ls"
<diegoviola>	phoenixz: what do you mean?
<bls>	tried zathura to read PDFs? it's pretty lightweight, uses vi keybinds, and is plugin based for file support (pdf, ps, djvu, etc)
<hassoon>	*theù instead
<hassoon>	*them
<phoenixz>	e2fsck finished 88% of harddrive scanned, 88/0/0 errors so far... This is a 2.5" 1TB internal laptop harddrive in a laptop I bought new last october, would that be worrysome?
<hassoon>	bls: will try it now
<ayecee>	phoenixz: yes
<baegle>	RailRoadRunner: It is? I haven't been able to find documentation on the difference
<phoenixz>	diegoviola: That most linux users think so..
<diegoviola>	phoenixz: right, but I can't really think why linux is not more popular on the desktop, it's easier to use than Windows these days
<desayuno>	it's only superficially easier to use
<diegoviola>	I personally think it's always been
<desayuno>	once you need to do something a bit different than usual people get scared
<desayuno>	also remember that less technically proficient people tend to stick to what they know
<baegle>	diegoviola: it's because hardware manufacturers write drivers for Windows first
<RailRoadRunner>	baegle: Maybe I was thinking of pipes. Redirect is a pipe of sorts, but perhaps only in my mind
<phoenixz>	diegoviola: Everybody else has microsoft stuff, games (though that finally is catching up), adobe stuff like photoshop
<diegoviola>	baegle: but that is changing right?
<desayuno>	they've got the filesystem down and they know the desktop and yada yaday
<baegle>	RailRoadRunner: I think you're right, but I can't figure out what the difference it
<desayuno>	most people don't realize they have a choice
<hassoon>	is there somethin i need to install so my pdf readers display pictures inside pdf documents?
<desayuno>	they think that computer = windows (and OSX is just some weird not-computer shit)
<phoenixz>	baegle: diegoviola: Then there is the driver issue as well though ironically, linux supports more hardware out of the box than any other OS
<ayecee>	desayuno: mind the language, please.
<phoenixz>	But nvidia and ATI should start playing nice or we'll never get out of the driver mess
<desayuno>	jeez really?
<baegle>	phoenixz: more in total, but what matters is newest, not most
<diegoviola>	phoenixz: when it comes to drivers, I think I have a much better experience with Linux than with any other OS out there, when I boot a recent distro with a recent kernel, most of my hardware is already detected out of the box
<phoenixz>	baegle: Therein lies the problem, manufacturers need to support it.. Though on servers that wont be a problem, on desktop it is a major pain in the butt
<ayecee>	diegoviola does this crap every day.
<phoenixz>	diegoviola: not to mention that a linux driver can be as much as a few kb, and a windows driver is at least a DVD with crap :D
<ayecee>	he likes it when people talk with him.
<diegoviola>	ayecee: excuse me?
<phoenixz>	ayecee: lol
<phoenixz>	ayecee: I haven
<diegoviola>	ayecee: I don't care about your attention or anyone else's if that's what you mean
<phoenixz>	ayecee: I havent been on #linux for a while, so I forgot the names I see coming by
<bls>	at least he's not on a "why isn't everyone worshipping pulseaudio/wayland/systemd/new tech of the week"
<diegoviola>	ayecee: also, please don't ad hominem me or I'll report you, thank you
<phoenixz>	diegoviola: easy now, we're all having a good time here
<ayecee>	diegoviola: it's difficult to tell the difference between a sun-blinded zealot and a troll, but neither is welcome.
<diegoviola>	ok I admit I have been repetitive with those questions, sorry
<triceratux>	diegoviola: linux is for headless ssh tunnelbeards in framebuffers & it always will be
<phoenixz>	bls: talking about systemd.. I just installed Kubuntu 15.04 on my laptop.. Which is kind of the reason I'm doing that HD scan now because I need to backup my entire laptop.. And I need to do that backup because systemd messed up my machine badly.. I don't have too got an impression atm of it..
<phoenixz>	IS it true that systemd does binary logs instead of normal text?
<fred1807>	cant belive there is no alsamixer web gui
<ayecee>	phoenixz: yes
<bls>	phoenixz: that's correct
<phoenixz>	And I like binary logs because....?
<ayecee>	phoenixz: wasn't it bad sectors that messed up your system?
<phoenixz>	I mean, text logs, great, binary logs... I need logs in case of problems.. problems might corrupt binary stuff like binary logs..
<bls>	systemd has (maybe had, I think they've fixed it) serious issues if the main drives in your fs tab don't come up cleanly and immediately
<phoenixz>	ayecee: Well, those bad blocks came after... My system got messed up by 15.04 systemd, so I wanted to reinstall, I started to make a backup and decided to also backup this 1TB drive which is just storage of large backups...  Then I started seeing mc hanging on the bad blocks
<ayecee>	phoenixz: a casual observer might think the problems were related.
<phoenixz>	ayecee: well, my laptop has 2 drives, a 256GB SSD and 1TB HDD which is just for storage.. The mess was on the OS level with systemd absolutely hanging itself.. Could no longer boot.. I could still boot with upstard though, so with that I started backing up
<phoenixz>	And yeah, I should have done backup before the upgrade, guilty as charged..
<freeone3000>	Hi. I have physical control of a machine, but the admin password seems to have been lost to the winds. Is there any way I can reset the root password without bringing down the server's networking stack?
<ayecee>	freeone3000: no
<phoenixz>	Just out of curiosity, no flames intended.. What was / is the reasoning behind systemd doing binary logs? What, in their eyes, is the advantage over text logs?
<ayecee>	freeone3000: needs reboot
<FauxReal>	boot into single user mode freeone3000
<pclover>	^
<phoenixz>	FauxReal: freeone3000: single user mode will bring down network stack
<bls>	phoenixz: they claim they're faster
<FauxReal>	i know this is sans network... option #2 is let it run w/o root pass and get ass owned.
<phoenixz>	bls: But in order to see them, I need to run that through another program.. How much faster woudl that be? Any documentation on that?
<bls>	phoenixz: the speed is supposed to come from being able to better index, search, and filter binary data over arbitrary textual data
<freeone3000>	phoenixz: FauxReal: ayecee: Alright, thanks.
<phoenixz>	bls: At least we did not get a windows like registry for configuration..
<bls>	I'd imagine it's coming
<FauxReal>	sysd in cent/rhel7 has given my at least 4 ulcers
<bls>	gconf already exists. no experience with it though
<FauxReal>	pisses of splunk bastion host too
<phoenixz>	bls: I see no practical reason for that.. speed increase? nope.. and with the history that windows has with its registry, I think that would be a very very bad idea (tm)
<ayecee>	phoenixz: probably best not to fight with straw men.
<phoenixz>	ayecee: straw men? where?
<FauxReal>	behind you.. with velcro zipper
<phoenixz>	ayecee: If you're referring to the windows history with its registry.. I don;t know how it is now, but when I used windows (like 10 years ago) the registry has been hell since day one, always a mess and problems, so yeah, windows has a bit of bad history there
<ayecee>	phoenixz: you want to argue that systemd is bad, and you're picking on a third-hand report of one of its features to do so.
<phoenixz>	ayecee: Though yeah, I'm referring to personal accounts, but I doubt I was the only one
<Pessimist>	registryd
<Pessimist>	coming soon (tm)
<balloonface>	is there a way to tell "openssl s_client" to close once it successfully sets up the SSL connection?
<bls>	looks like dconf/gsettings is the current effort
<phoenixz>	ayecee: Well, I'm not arguing its bad at all. I do argue that it made my laptop crash becase.. well, it did.. Also not arguing that binary logs are bad. I'm highly skeptical, and was asking why they are using binary logs, and what the suposed advantage is (over risk of corruption on the other hand)
<mejo>	hello

*	triceratux anticipates plenty of first-hand reports :P
<ayecee>	fwiw, went off without a hitch here. that's my anecdote.
<maarhart>	I don't know if I should ask here... I reboot my laptop with the lid closed and I can see that it is turning on, I see grub for example, the ubuntu splash for some time, and then the display turns off. Also the internal display turns off, and I have no way tu turn it back on. I just have to press the power switch to turn it off
<triceratux>	me too but i only run from the install iso & wouldnt consider running the installers
<ayecee>	maarhart: does it work with the lid open?
<maarhart>	ayecee: yes

<ayecee>	maarhart: could go into the power settings and change the action that it does when the lid is closed.
<ayecee>	i usually set it to "do nothing" when on AC power
<maarhart>	I did that
<ayecee>	ok
<phus>	i have a process that runs @ 100% CPU every now and then I see it drops to .05% then goes back up to 100%
<phus>	what could be causing this
<ayecee>	magentar: i got nothing, then :(
<phus>	I'm trying to figure out what's taking away the cpu
<maarhart>	also in systemd ignored lidhandleswitch
<MetaNova>	phus: watch 'top' or 'htop' for a while and see which one it is?
<phus>	MetaNova i've tried that can't see anything
<phoenixz>	phus: If you know a process goes to 100%, then you also know which one
<MetaNova>	phus: if it's so quickly going from 0.05% to 100% and back again that you can't even see it while watching top/htop, then you need to stop worrying
<phoenixz>	maarhart: what distro, and also, do you have nvidia or ATI video card?
<phoenixz>	maarhart: also, can you CTRL-F1 or CTRL-F2 to one of the text consoles?
<RailRoadRunner>	phoenixz: CTRL-ALT-F1 ?
<phoenixz>	RailRoadRunner: maarhart: Oops, CTRL-ALT-F1, my bad
<maarhart>	ubuntu, I have an old white macbook... ati radeon I think. I can't go to consoles.
<maarhart>	phoenixz: the laptop display goes off and nothing seems to change it. But I can connect to the IP of my computer (it is a mythtv server)
<phoenixz>	maarhart: My first guess would be ATI driver issue then, but since you're saying ubuntu, I take it 15.04? I've had a dumpload of problems with that distro (Granted, Kubuntu, but its basically the same) since it came out and Ubuntu has been having issues with new distros for the first few weeks after release since the last 3 releases or so.. It used to be that I could install alpha version and I could work okay, now even the main release barely
<phoenixz>	installs.. IMHO they should spend some more time on testing, but thats just me. Either way, wait a few weeks for the first batch of bug fix updates, and ask in #ubuntu
<maarhart>	phoenixz: yes, the ubuntu vivid.
<maarhart>	lubuntu, whatever

<PercyB>	It seems so, as the last plasma-active image I found is from 2013. Somehow the development got stuck

<}>	err not zathura, zenity
<}>	I mixed the names up
<maarhart>	I forgot to mention, I get an error with X --configure
<maarhart>	number of created screens does not match number of detected devices
<maarhart>	phoenixz: would this be related?
<ayecee>	that error doesn't appear with lid open?
<maarhart>	that error only appears with lid open.
<phoenixz>	maarhart: Could be, maybe with the screen closed it does not detect the device, and just assumes no screen available.. Again, we're talking 15.04, right? It all has been a very  (20+ bugs so far) buggy ride for me, so far, so I want to imagine this will be fixed with bugfix updates.. Also, check #ubuntu, loads of people with more experience with systemd there..
<maarhart>	I don't know what happens with lid closed :)
<phoenixz>	maarhart: you can SSH into the device? do a tail -F /var/log/X.log (I think its X.log, or perhaps xorg.log)
<phoenixz>	maarhart: then you get log output from X server
<phoenixz>	maarhart: ah frack, systemd, binary logs.. You need to do that in a different way, not sure how atm...
<}>	phoenixz, systemd still has Xorg.log
<phoenixz>	maarhart: Again, #ubuntu is probably overflowing with people having systemd issues atm...
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<}>	but you can use journalctl if you wish
<maarhart>	I will try ssh. I want to see if there is a gui at all.
<Psi-Jack>	and you can always look at the systemd journal's, even have rsyslog pick up journal and log to individual files.
<phoenixz>	}: IT does? great.. well, I suppose I should start learning journalctl soon though
<}>	phoenixz, journalctl <enter>

<superboot>	Psi-Jack: Ah, I'll see if I can find it.

<haasn>	“make nconfig”, however, does not reset it
<haasn>	Ah, I can use “make nconfig” and re-save it
<ayecee>	haasn: normally need to run "make oldconfig" when taking a config from a previous version.
<triceratux>	phoenixz: im not defending systemd itself but its up to the inividual distros to deploy it properly so im sure #ubuntu is an interesting place right now

<IIT>	The main point ^
<FreezingCold>	Can't KVM do nasty crap?

<problema>	Hello all, i am about to make a disk cloning from a 500gb disk (only 20gb used) to a 40gb partition on another disk.

Is there a way to tell DD to only copy the used space? thanks
*	Cybert1nus is now known as Cybertinus
<dixie__>	IIT: okay, well if you're hosting files (audio, video, documents, etc.) I'm going to suggest that the most efficient way of hosting them will be with standard ass apache, lighthttpd, or some other httpd.
<IIT>	Ok
<problema>	i've read also that using "dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/delete.me bs=8M; rm delete.me" is a way to make the empty disk space full of zeroes. But i am not sure if that will stop DD from making a 500gb img
<dixie__>	IIT: while you technically *can* virtualize a media server, you really shouldn't unless you have a good reason.  what's going to cause you problems will be bridging the network interfaces to make your vm outside accessible. vm's are norioriously picky about such things.  For what you'd like to build, that's an unnessary headache.
<dixie__>	EriC^^: ahh.. you mean that ii.
<IIT>	Yeah that can be useless more work to do.
<bls>	and the current trend with containers (docker especially) is to deploy a bunch of them, not be happy with the way they're configured, then resort to all kinds of ugly hack to punch holes through the containerization
<EriC^^>	dixie__: yeah, anyways i used apt-cache policy instead
<EriC^^>	for i in $(apt-cache rdepends xserver-xorg-core | sed 's/|//'); do if [ "$(apt-cache policy $i | awk '/Installed/ {print$2}')" != "(none)" ]; then echo found in $i; fi; done

<dixie__>	EriC^^: awk has it's own scripting language.  I generally try to use sed or grep over awk if possible.  Awk scripting is one of those things that's been on my list to spend time learning more about too.
<}>	My experience with awk is that its often easiesr to just use vimscript
<miketo>	nevermind,  rereading your comment, it looks like you're just complaining about how it's difficult to setup the networking.
<dixie__>	miketo: I know that bridged interfaces are noriously unpredictable.  better to tunnel if possible.
<koala_man>	EriC^^: the reason it didn't work for you is that variables don't expand in single quotes. if you want to do it right, you can pass in variables using -v or the environment. if you want to do it sloppily, you can fix the quoting so that the variable expands

<problema>	i don't understand koala_man
<Thesaurus>	freezing thats a really generic question with specific answers
<dixie__>	miketo: yup.  when left to it's own, the bridge seems to drop out every so often.  we tried taps, but they didn't work how we wanted.  I established a tunnel from an app server to it's master node to streamline a startup script and the network stabalized.  seemed to work for me, and we've been very happy with the results.  That's now part of our standard app server init script.
<koala_man>	problema: it writes the entire disk to a file called mbr.mbr. if you want just the first 512 bytes, use  bs=512 count=1

<jushur>	tortib: i just joined channel, what was your question?
<tortib>	hey everyone, I'm looking for a cloud storage solution that is fairly cheap that also has the capabilities to be mounted with CIFS.  Does anyone have any recommendations?  (I need a lot of storage 2TB+ but for now I'm starting at about 100GB).
<FreezingCold>	tortib: If you want an insane amount of storage, this is the cheapest I found when I did my research. https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/dedicated-servers/storage/2014-FS-30T.xml Costs $6 per TB.
<tortib>	wtf
<FreezingCold>	30TB is probably more than what you want though, so saying 2TB+ isn't really narrowing it down.
<problema>	can i restore a disk that i copied with "cp" to it's original state if needed?
<tortib>	$6 per TB?!@
<tortib>	that's insane cheap
<Thesaurus>	I've never dropped the 14.04.2 LTS ubuntu kernel into CentOS 7.1.  I doubt it would boot, it might though, but they're other routes to changing the kernel used in CentOS which seems more sane and safe
<miketo>	dixie__: now i'm interested.  are you using kvm?  how's the vm connected to the host (TUN, TAP, ??? -- bridge only makes sense if bridging an existing tap to another interface)
<FreezingCold>	except you have to buy 30TB at once.
<FreezingCold>	so...
<tortib>	ah yea
<tortib>	I want to pay as the data grows
<tortib>	Google Storage is an awesome solution but they don't have the capabilities to mount with CIFS or NFS :(
<FreezingCold>	it also is going to take several days to even write 30TB lol
<FreezingCold>	tortib: you probably want a cheap VPS.
<tortib>	FreezingCold, VPS does not have the storage
<FreezingCold>	sure they do.
<tortib>	where can I get 1TB for about $50 a month?
<FreezingCold>	https://vpsdime.com/cart.php?gid=2
<tortib>	because that's how much google storage charges
<FreezingCold>	$14/m for 1TB.
<FreezingCold>	well... they're sold out right now.
<bls>	this is ##linux, not ##cloudstorageshopping
<ohcanada>	$14 a minute seems quite expensive
<tortib>	FreezingCold, nah it would be a pain to implement multiple of those
<FreezingCold>	bls: but he wants a server that runs Linux.
<tortib>	I need one mount point with a lot of storage capacity
<FreezingCold>	tortib: hence why they offer larger storage.
<FreezingCold>	did you even look at the page?
<tortib>	yes it only goes up to 6TB...
<damaddy>	http://www.kimsufi.com/us/en/
<bls>	find then, it's also not ##vpsshopping either
<tortib>	and that's $84 a month
<tortib>	which is expensive
<damaddy>	has some cheap and good servers
<FreezingCold>	tortib: you can ask them to expand your disk space as you use it most likely.
<FreezingCold>	It's still $14 per TB.
<tortib>	damaddy, capacity isn't there
<FreezingCold>	[15:24:12] <tortib> where can I get 1TB for about $50 a month?
<FreezingCold>	I gave you one for $14
<FreezingCold>	how is $14 > $50?
<tortib>	lol
<damaddy>	says "disk 2TB" ;)
<tortib>	FreezingCold, because the VPS will eventually run out of bandwidth allocation, with google drive you pay 0.002 for 1TB of traffic
<tortib>	pretty good deal
<tortib>	FreezingCold, i'm looking for seamingless scalability as well
<FreezingCold>	again, they're using OpenVZ, nearly any VPS provider will be able to "upgrade" your account.
<tortib>	I don't like that companys webpage either
<tortib>	they say they have -2 available...some is bad with the maths
<ohcanada>	negative isn't too bad, if that number was imaginary, then i'd start worrying
<tortib>	true, I guess the negative number means they have some on back order?
<tortib>	hell I don't know.
<FreezingCold>	srsly? their webpage is fine...
<FreezingCold>	who cares.
<tortib>	Tons of people do
<FreezingCold>	it's a VPS.
<tortib>	and one of those people is me.
<FreezingCold>	You shouldn't have to go to the provider's page EVER after signing up.
<FreezingCold>	Then use Google. They have fancy GUIs to impress you.
<dixie__>	miketo: VMs are run on their own VPS or within qemu.  bridge is started as normal at boot, then an ssh tunnel is established 'home'.  nothing too crazy, and definately no tap/tun outside of the VM.  just bridge to the outside world and direct the traffic.
<tortib>	But they don't have CIFS or NFS :/
<dixie__>	I was messing with googlecl.  that was a really cool project.  I'm sorry it's no longer being actively developed.
<FreezingCold>	tortib: news flash: CIFS and NFS isn't something most GUI-happy users even know about.
<dixie__>	truth. ^^^
*	cheapie_ is now known as cheapie
<FreezingCold>	really a VPS or dedicated server (for several TB) is the best way to go.
<}>	ohcanada, it is, -2 + i0 :)
<miketo>	dixie__: qemu -netdev bridge creates a tap then bridges it to another interface (eth0) .    Are you sure you mean bridge?
<tortib>	FreezingCold, it wouldn't work for me, cloud storage would be a better solution
<tortib>	I just need cloud storage with CIFS or NFS
<tortib>	I prefer CIFS
<blind>	cifs over the public internet sounds really scary
<tortib>	why is that?
<blind>	smb allows for unencrypted data transfer.
<tortib>	nobody mentioned SMB
<tortib>	I'm talking about CIFS
<blind>	CIFS is an implementation of SMB
<tortib>	o
<dixie__>	miketo: no command line switch.  this is all done from within the VM.
<dixie__>	miketo: that's one reason why this is now our standard solution.
<dixie__>	SMB's a bad idea.
<e66>	I need a directory where everyone should have write access. Which user should own this directory? nobody?
<tortib>	hmmm
<miketo>	dixie__: ^^;;  it doesn't matter, if the vm communicates to the outside world then there must be a channel.
<tortib>	anyone familiar with gsutil?
<dixie__>	e66: good question. I'd say nobody:users
<MetaNova>	e66: as long as group and other have rwx I don't think the user matters.
<dixie__>	anyone else have an opinion?
<MetaNova>	nobody:users sounds like what I'd go with, too
<e66>	MetaNova: I can use a 777 mode. But I want to assign it to a specific user so that no one owns it. Want to generalize it.
<dixie__>	miketo: qemu and the VPS both create outside interfaces.  All we do is reinforce the interface.  it's really not as crazy as it sounds.
<MetaNova>	e66: then use nobody
<dixie__>	e66: you should probably use something like 077. ;-)
<MetaNova>	^
<dixie__>	...because no one owns the directory.
<dixie__>	or even 066
<dixie__>	unless you need execution.
<MetaNova>	dixie__: well the directory itself would need +x
<adoniscik>	how can you concisely feed arguments to a pipe? when I use xargs args | foo |bar, bar sees the results of foo args, whereas I want a separate output of foo | bar for each element of args.
<}>	:o 4.0.1-1 is in arch stable
<dixie__>	MetaNova: shouldn't unless users are executing code.  directories get d flags.
<dixie__>	}: kernel?
<MetaNova>	dixie__: directories require +x to be traversable
<}>	dixie__, yes
<dixie__>	}: how is that?
<}>	dixie__, ?
<MetaNova>	dixie__: +x is NOT about executing code when it comes to directories
<}>	adoniscik, could you explain what you're trying to do?
<dixie__>	MetaNova: eh.  whatever.  either way, 066/077 is probably the way to go.
<MetaNova>	dixie__: no, 066 is NOT the way to go
<spookah>	066?
<adoniscik>	} I just tried. Which part is unclear?
<spookah>	directory without +x = can't cd into the dir
<MetaNova>	^
<}>	adoniscik, It seems you want a loop iterating over each argument, and running foo arg_n | bar
<adoniscik>	precisely
<}>	adoniscik, just use a for loop in bash or zsh
<MetaNova>	what's more, +x on directories is required in order to read the contents of files located within those directories
<MetaNova>	there was a discussion about directories and +x earlier in this channel
<MetaNova>	[2015.04.28-22.58.50] <MetaNova> so, in summary, +x on directories is required for reading the contents of files within directories, and +r on directories is required for reading the contents of directories
<MetaNova>	dixie__: you are quite mistaken
<adoniscik>	thank you, }
<dixie__>	MetaNova: fyi, mkdir creates directories as 755 or drwxr-xr-x
<MetaNova>	dixie__: correct
<}>	adoniscik, I'm not entirely sure where you get your arguments, here's a possible solution if they're in a file : while read -r line; do foo "$line" | bar ; done < q
<dixie__>	MetaNova: so congradulations, no one cares.
<MetaNova>	dixie__: I'm not sure what your point is
<}>	adoniscik, where the filename is q
<adoniscik>	} I enumerate them manually, but I am getting a a"missing end of string" error
<dixie__>	MetaNova: it's a moot point.
<}>	adoniscik, enumerate? could you show an example
<dixie__>	there is no point.
<MetaNova>	dixie__: it's not a moot point, you shouldn't be giving invalid information to people seeking help
<adoniscik>	for arg in (a b c) ; do ...
<dixie__>	it's a chicken shit discussion.
<MetaNova>	dixie__: it's a discussion which highlights the limitations of your understanding of permissions
<dixie__>	oh lord.
<MetaNova>	dixie__: you could have simply gone, "oh, I didn't realize that" and that could have been the end of it, but instead you're saying it doesn't matter
<MetaNova>	dixie__: seriously, what's wrong with you?

<MetaNova>	dixie__: then state your recommendation as u-rwx, not something incorrect

<FreezingCold>	tortib: you could be lazy like me and use sshfs
<MetaNova>	FreezingCold: sshfs is hugely convenient at times
<FreezingCold>	my ssh connections get saturated to hell haha
<dixie__>	MetaNova: novel concept, I'm sure, but if you're the expert on modes, why didn't feel compelled to answer the question in the first place?

<dixie__>	might want to take a look.  the question was about ownership, not permissions, and yes - ownership _does_ matter.  but thanks for the input.  even though you answered a question (badly) that wasn't asked.
<FreezingCold>	tortib: k, so here's some comparisons. Local ramdisk is 1.9 GB/s, local hard drive (with LUKS) is 60.5 MB/s, "remote" (same network over WiFi) server (on LUKS) with SSHFS is 5.5 MB/s
<FreezingCold>	those are bytes, not bits FYI.

<FreezingCold>	44 Mbps is probably the limit of my wireless network
<drag>	Is there a way to do that?
<dixie__>	so it seems the correct user:group for an unowned directory is nobody:users and the correct mode should be 377, so EVERYONE was wrong, but anarchy still works because we've eventually arrived at a correct solution.  everybody write that down: nobody:users 377
<dwhite>	drag: adding a umask command to /etc/profile would apply to all users.
<FreezingCold>	oh how I love ramdisks
<FreezingCold>	best things ever.
<drag>	dwhite, I don't want it to apply to all users.  Only to those in a particular group and only for a particular directory.  Is that possible?

<tortib>	FreezingCold, I don't think I can use SSHFS with google cloud storage though :(
<dixie__>	}: apparantly, according to our friend here the x flag is necessary for directory traversal.  I have no problem believing that, but the nobody:users allows everyone to be part of the group and gets rid of the ownership.
<}>	I see
<FreezingCold>	tortib: you definitely can't.
<FreezingCold>	tortib: native speed is 47.2 MB/s
<dixie__>	so 377 leaves the x flag for everyone, but removes the rw for the non-user.  should work.
<tortib>	I can't believe nobody offers cloud storage solutions with sshfs or cifs

<drag>	dixie__, I am a grader at my school and in order to grade, we run scripts that does the copying of submitted work and grades them for us.  However, when run, those scripts create files and directories that are owned by the person who owned them with the default permissions of 754.  I have set the group's sticky bit for our grading directory, so that the group owns them, but I also want the group to have write access to the directory by
<drag>	default.
<dixie__>	}: seems like the real question was more about 7xx or 0xx - or something else that keeps the directory from being stolen, but that's besides the point.
<FreezingCold>	a OpenVZ instance is exactly what you want.
<FreezingCold>	It can be scaled.
<dixie__>	drag: so what's the problem?  seems like you've got the situation well in hand.
<dwhite>	drag: sounds like you want something akin to /tmp: chmod 1777 <dir> (hide this directory underneath a protected directory)
<tortib>	FreezingCold, I get the feeling that you're the man behind that company you linked. :)
<}>	FreezingCold, oh no, he just called you a shill!
<FreezingCold>	tortib: use this one instead then. https://dirtcheap.ninja/
*	} cues dramatic music
<Fun>	u are SHILL
<Fun>	:D
<drag>	dixie__, because most of the graders fail to give the group write permissions to the files that are created, creating headache when one person is missing, scripts need to be rerun, etc...
<dixie__>	yes.  you *ARE* shill.
<FreezingCold>	=\
<diegoviola>	so is kdbus going to make it into the linux kernel at all or not? or is that already in -next?
<Fun>	dixie__: what does this process mean  MLogin:60B+ ? it eats ram
<Fun>	and I dont know whats it for
<diegoviola>	I still see people talking about that in the LKML
<drag>	dixie__, I just want to set the defaults so that the other graders don't have to worry about that step of changing the group permissions to allow the group to write to the files.
<dixie__>	drag: shouldn't the graders just be writing to the file in the directory using the existing permissioning anyways?
<dixie__>	drag: are you automating this with a script?
<dixie__>	Fun: I have no idea.
<drag>	dixie__, they do.  By default, when files are created either by hand or using a script, the permissions are 754.  I want to change those default permissions to 764.
<drag>	but only for that directory.
<dixie__>	drag: so change them.
<Fun>	:)
<drag>	How?  umask doesn't work at a per directory level.  That's the question.  How would I achieve something akin to umask but on just a directory and its subdirectories.
<dixie__>	drag: chmod
<drag>	dwhite, the file created in that directory are still created with the 754 permissions by default.
*	Samuel_Najdowski is now known as noob
<dixie__>	seems like you should already know that.
<drag>	dixie__, that requires the person at the console to run that.  That's the problem.  I want to set the permission by default so that I don't have to rely on whomever is running the scripts or creating the files to remember to chmod.
<dixie__>	drag: either automate it from their end, or change the permissions as root.
<dixie__>	if you don't have root access, talk to someone who does.
<dwhite>	drag: what is creating these files and directories? if it's an app/script, can it be modified to use the correct permissions?

<}>	you're writing the linux kernel in ruby?
<}>	fascinating
<dixie__>	havn't started yet.
<vinny_p>	hi. I'm trying to debug the linux boot process of an embedded system.
<dixie__>	}: would kinda be cool to use a friendly interpreted language on top of the kernel.
<dixie__>	vinny_p: read your logs
<dixie__>	}: call it the rubix kernel.
<vinny_p>	I would like to use gdb, but I couldn't find anything.
<vinny_p>	dixie__ : my logs?
<vinny_p>	I want to use gdb but I am having trouble getting started. any tutorials/pointers?
<dixie__>	vinny_p: why don't you have logs?
<}>	vinny_p, you want to use gdb on an embedded system before the OS has booted?
<}>	that's quite... strange
<dixie__>	you noticed ^^^ too?
<vinny_p>	I am able to read the print out, but I can not pin point the actual cause.
<vinny_p>	I would like to use something *like* gdb, but I can't find any tool.
<dixie__>	vinny_p: I seemed to find the gdb manual without any problems.  so what exactly are you having trouble with?
<dixie__>	I'm guessing you have a serial connection to the embedded box?
<dixie__>	what kind of box?
<vinny_p>	yes
<vinny_p>	Xilinx development board
<dixie__>	fill us in.  we're bored.
<dixie__>	and I'm stoned.
<dixie__>	ew.  okay.  we can work with that.
<dixie__>	so serial connection?
<vinny_p>	So I have a xilinx board with linux running on it.
<vinny_p>	the kernel boots half way then stops
<dixie__>	and you know it's booting?
<dixie__>	okay.
<dixie__>	where does it hang?
<vinny_p>	I have the log of the boot
<dixie__>	$1 says network
<dixie__>	any other bets?
<dixie__>	jsut tell me what it hangs on.  don't pastebin it.
<vinny_p>	I know what the actual log is suppose to be
<vinny_p>	so I can know when it stops
<dixie__>	so what does it stop on?
<dixie__>	}: I'm sensing a pattern here.
<vinny_p>	The kernels stops just after setting up hash tables but before setting up the ethernet driver (seemingly).
<dixie__>	YES! I knew it.
<vinny_p>	the ethernet has a interrupt
<vinny_p>	so I'm suspecting something to do with that
<vinny_p>	how can I know the cause of this issue
<dixie__>	okay, so have you tried just waiting and seeing if it's just pausing to set up the network?
<vinny_p>	it stops boot half way, yes
<dixie__>	have you configured /etc/network/interfaces yet?
<vinny_p>	it stops before it can register the network device
<vinny_p>	from I see
<dixie__>	sounds about right.
<vinny_p>	any ideas?
<dixie__>	so refresh my memory.  xilinx takes it's os from sdcard?
<vinny_p>	a flash
<vinny_p>	on the board
<dixie__>	can you edit the filesystem externally?
<vinny_p>	yes
<vinny_p>	well I can recompile the kerenl
<vinny_p>	kernel*
<dixie__>	that's not the same thing.
<vinny_p>	with my changes
<vinny_p>	I can edit the filesystem after it boot via the ethernet
<vinny_p>	but with my dilemma I can't do that
<vinny_p>	any ideas?
<dixie__>	okay, you can configure the network in the kernel config process.  do that.  because I'm guessing you have an eth0, but no lo.  not 100% sure, but that's a safe bet.  so do that, and re-compile.  and you should also be able to enable logging in kernel config too.  you need that.
<dixie__>	redirect your logging to your serial connetion.  see what's going on.  then once you get booted you should be good.
<vinny_p>	ok. but isn't there tools for me to openup the kernel boot and 'see' the error
<vinny_p>	cause I'm not sure what the error really is
<dixie__>	I'm telling you the tool to 'see' the error.
<vinny_p>	it may be the interrupts configuration
<mrknife>	Hi guys! How one bares any process besides one from executing on single CPU core?
<dixie__>	might be.  but I'm going to guess you have an external network interface configured, but no localhost.  you need that.
<vinny_p>	ok.
<vinny_p>	but I don't even need the ethernet
<dixie__>	mrknife: sounds like you just want to run in single user mode.
<dixie__>	vinny_p: you still need a localhost.
<vinny_p>	I can boot off the flash
<dixie__>	to do damn near anything.
<vinny_p>	oh
<kervan>	Hello, My local bind server doesn't resolve any host. for example $dig wordpress.org doesn't return any IP Address, but the same configuration work on other computer. I don't know how to start to bug track. Can you please help me abut that?
<dixie__>	vinny_p: doesn't seem like booting from flash is working very well.
<mrknife>	dixie__: nope, I want to run SMP system with single process monopolizing single core
<}>	dixie__, I guess I know why it was 5.5g now
<vinny_p>	ok. I'll try to bypass the network configuration then

<irgendwer4711>	Psi-Jack: ok what information is in a public key file?
<kervan>	dixie__:  whois not installed in my server, and I'm not able to install it because I can't resolve the host name to install whois :)
<Psi-Jack>	irgendwer4711: A key.
<irgendwer4711>	only?
<dixie__>	irgendwer4711: and a username and host.
<dixie__>	and key type.
<Psi-Jack>	dixie__: Incorrect.
<irgendwer4711>	dixie__: this is the plain part?
<Psi-Jack>	Key type, yes.
<dixie__>	I just cat mine, just to be sure.  type, key, user@host.
<Psi-Jack>	Key Type, Key. That's what's in an openssh public key.
<dixie__>	irgendwer4711: .ssh/id_rsa.pub
<Psi-Jack>	Anything else is additional useless data. :)
<irgendwer4711>	ah ok, I though of other data like in a SSL cert
<irgendwer4711>	e.g. generation date
<Psi-Jack>	Now, in an authorized_keys file, those useless pieces of data can be useful to, for example, limit what that key is allowed to do, such as what it can execute.
<dixie__>	I know I ssh login fails for me without a valid user@host.  but you might have different results.
<Psi-Jack>	dixie__: That is incorrect.
<dixie__>	I guess I just won the bad luck lottery then, because that's what I get.
<Psi-Jack>	That's still incorrect.

<kervan>	dixie__: I can't access to any domains. I'm trying wordpress.org currently.
<dixie__>	}: hmm. I can't see any reason for it either.
<Marezz>	hello everyone :)

<dixie__>	kervan: well in that case, I'll save you some trouble.  you can't bind to wordpress.org
<dixie__>	}: right?
<dixie__>	}: further investigation is required.
<mrknife>	dixie__: Yes, but I'm not interested in this "binding" stuff or setting affinity - I want to know how to assign CPU *core* to process, not other way around :)
<}>	I googled big haddock and it showed me some kind of fish
<Psi-Jack>	mrknife: You don't.
<dixie__>	mrknife: keep up.  two seperate things.
<dixie__>	things move fast around here.
<dixie__>	kervan: ps. whois wordpress.org resolved just fine.
<mrknife>	dixie__: the thing is I work with such a system and want to know how it's implemented
<kervan>	dixie__: I don't want to bind to wordpress. My dns server is defined as 127.0.0.1 in my /etc/resolv.conf, When I add there 8.8.8.8 I can ping wordpress.org but When I leave it 127.0.0.1 I can't ping any domain.
<dixie__>	kervan: that's because you don't have a domain associated with that machine.  there's nothing to resolve for dns.  /etc/resolv.conf is for domain name resolution of the local, which in your case is 127.0.0.1 and localhost
<dixie__>	you can't arbitrarily bind your local externally.
<dixie__>	mrknife: well that howto seemed to do a pretty good job of explaining it for me.
<dixie__>	}: haddock is a fish.
<mrknife>	dixie__: OK, I will reread it but it looks quite dated ;) Thanks!

<ivali>	vdevatman, are you looking for suspend?
<oehansen>	dixie__: I'll take you up on that someday :)

<pingfloyd>	dixie__: friend of mine got elevation sickness when he visited CO
<dixie__>	oehansen: basically, I wake up, and smoke and work until I fall asleep.  everything but housing is dirt cheap here.  and people generally at least know that linux has something to do with computers.  it's great.
<vdevatman>	ivali: but once i do that i can't restore it from where i have stored it
<ivali>	vdevatman, i would send the updated values through signals ....
<pingfloyd>	dixie__: that sounds like Seattle
<ivali>	or force the process to read some values from a file from time to time, to send updated values?

<pingfloyd>	most of the time I just look average build though
<dixie__>	pingfloyd: it has it's advantages.
<ivali>	vdevatman, no.
<pingfloyd>	it does
<}>	vdevatman, no, you have to use a VM and suspend it, or that special kernel feature ivali mentioned
<pingfloyd>	I can get back into shape pretty quickly
<}>	vdevatman, alternatively alter the source so you can re-load the state from any point
<ivali>	but give CRIU a chance, install that package, it should be in your distribution repository
<dixie__>	vdevatman: I have no idea why you'd want to do that, but apparantly you can.
<ivali>	it actually dumps the /proc/pid info in a special file
<ivali>	that allows restore
<yuciyuar>	hi. can i control graphical settings like optimising contrast, on a open source graphic driver? is there an application for this?

<Psi-Jack>	spookah: According to google, the last digit of PI is 9 :)
<dixie__>	yuciyuar: contrast, I don't know about.  but it works for brightness.
<pingfloyd>	yuciyuar: you could try using xbacklight, unless you're using a DE that has the settings in its applets

<diegoaguilar>	Hello, I got a problem with a ssh server on a Ubuntu 14.04 I cant actually connect through ssh
<pingfloyd>	yuciyuar: is the sound a 60 cycle hum?
<diegoaguilar>	I got correct port configured at sshd.config
<diegoaguilar>	and Listen Address is set to *
<diegoaguilar>	however I cant connect at all
<spookah>	diegoaguilar: iptables -S
<diegoaguilar>	I use ufw as firewall spookah
<spookah>	diegoaguilar: can you ssh to localhost?
<diegoaguilar>	spookah you mean from server
<diegoaguilar>	?
<spookah>	diegoaguilar: from localhost?
<occupant>	so it's been forever since I've tried doing a compressed tar pipe, but I remember it being a useful and effective thing. trying it now, my network throughput is only 45 Mbit/s and the MB/s written to disk is slower than an rsync. Shouldn't this be better instead of worse?
<occupant>	And yes, it's compressable data.
<diegoaguilar>	spookah I can ssh from my own machine
<diegoaguilar>	yes
<spookah>	diegoaguilar: i would bet on your firewall as the problem.. if sshd_config was misconfigured you wouldnt be able to connect locally
<diegoaguilar>	so ufw shows my port 2222 as enabled
<pingfloyd>	why not port 22?
<diegoaguilar>	they didnt want to open that port at building network
<diegoaguilar>	its just "because"
<pingfloyd>	that's a real non-standard port for ssh
<diegoaguilar>	should I have HostKey lines uncommented?
<pingfloyd>	apparently ESET uses that port
<awkwardtechdude>	I need a good resource for learning to code. Also, what is a good first programming language for learning fundamentals?
<pingfloyd>	which is AV
<diegoaguilar>	Im not using ESET
<pingfloyd>	why port 2222 instead of 22?

<dumyan>	I'm using rsync to copy files and I'm getting lots of chgrp errors. This can't be fixed right now, but it leads to a bigger problem. On folders with lots of chgrp errors sometimes the copying stalls on a non-error line (im using verbose) and on sigint the errors are printed out and a broken pipe error at the end. I've redirecting the errors to a file and I get the same behaviour.
<awkwardtechdude>	spookah: I'd like to try web development.
<hassoon>	awkwardtechdude: you're so awkward nab.
<spookah>	diegoaguilar: are you sure 2222 is not firewalled?

<awkwardtechdude>	I'd like to try javascript
<diegoaguilar>	I use iftop and I can see network incoming from my client ip

<diegoaguilar>	I just disabled firewall at server
<triceratux>	wo this is actually cool http://c.camden.rutgers.edu/c_resources/c_programming/
<diegoaguilar>	but I cant connect
<Loshki>	dumyan: add --partial --progress to see what's happening. What kind of filesystems are they?
<spookah>	diegoaguilar: your building assigned you a public IP?
<diegoaguilar>	yep
<diegoaguilar>	they did
<diegoaguilar>	and port 80 is actually working
<pingfloyd>	diegoaguilar: you're going to need to forward the port through the firewall
<checkmatein1>	what m8
<checkmatein1>	linsux
<dumyan>	Loshki, I'm copying from zfs to xfs. The xfs is mounted over nfs for the copying. I think nfs gets overbuffered with errors or something. If the folders doesn't contain lots of problematic files it works good.
<diegoaguilar>	pingfloyd they are doing it
<occupant>	dumyan: perhaps you should just be using rsync
<Loshki>	dumyan: well, the nice thing about rsync is you can run it repeatedly until it succeeds, unless it sticks in the same place every time?
<checkmatein1>	linux? lol
<checkmatein1>	linux is dead m8
<dumyan>	occupant, I've tought of that too, but this got me wondering
*	Loshki pops a brewski and settles back for the show
<dumyan>	Loshki, yes it is, but the problem is I cannot automate that because it just hangs without a return except on sigint. If I do it manually it would take me forever
<Loshki>	dumyan: pls confirm. Are you saying it sticks at the same place every time?
<dumyan>	Loshki, oh sorry. I think it's random, sometimes It get further sometimes don't. It displays the chgrp errors on all copied files on every run
<occupant>	c'mon, just rip out that un-needed NFS step and do it direct
<occupant>	all it's gonna do is bottleneck performance and potentially cause you problems
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	In the awk debugger, how can one print the input line?
<checkmatein1>	hi
<checkmatein1>	btw can I text someone in northern ireland from england
<checkmatein1>	or is it roaming
<Loshki>	dumyan: rsync shouldn't recopy already copied files. So if you keep running it, it should terminate eventually. Does the group even exist on the target machine?
<occupant>	funfact: NFS doesn't support membership in more than 166 groups no matter what you do.
<Psi-Jack>	Interesting.
<dumyan>	Loshki, my guess is that it goes over the files to check them so it just tries to change the group, it isn't recopying the. The group doesn't exist but that's a separate issue which cannot be resolved right now.
<Psi-Jack>	166 groups, or 16 groups? :p

<applepi>	Hi all..  kind of urgent.  Does anyone here know how to specify a DIFFERENT tty for the disconnect script for a PPPD call / chat script than what is used for the connect script?
<occupant>	After migrating a system that hinged on large group membership to an NFS mount and having everything fall apart, I tried REALLY hard to find something that worked, but in the end I gave up and returned it to baremetal.
<Psi-Jack>	applepi: Umm.. Urgent? And on IRC? And.. WTF Why would you want that?
<applepi>	Psi-Jack, because the first port gets caught in data mode and I can't send ATH
<applepi>	and +++ gets lost for some reason
<applepi>	however it works on the other port
<Psi-Jack>	Are... You... Actually... Using a modem?
<applepi>	yes.
<spookah>	lol

<spookah>	that was epic
<pingfloyd>	that worked on decent modems
<applepi>	Their rep suggests the +++ is coming back too fast..  which doesn't make any sense because it's already baud rate limited.
<pingfloyd>	there were plenty of crap ones they'd lose connection every time
<Psi-Jack>	That worked on decent modems /and/ reliable phone companies, had to have both though.
<grogoreo>	hi
<Psi-Jack>	applepi: Too... Fast? Your "Rep" is an idiot.
<applepi>	Yeah I don't get it either.
<pingfloyd>	I had a second line back then anyway
<Psi-Jack>	Though, you could always make it send +pause+pause+pausepauseATH
<alanjf>	barduck: That's why you shouldn't kiss anyone when you're about to vomit...
<pingfloyd>	don't know why it would have such problems hanging up
<Psi-Jack>	Heh. yeah.. That's their issue. Not yours. :p
<pingfloyd>	that's like last expected issue
<Psi-Jack>	Their modem anyway. :;
<pingfloyd>	hang up is pretty simple
<applepi>	wait, how do I send pauses..?
*	tfields is now known as Arven

<Psi-Jack>	applepi: ,
<Psi-Jack>	Yeah, that simple. :)
<pingfloyd>	is this a winmodem?
<applepi>	Telit modem
<pingfloyd>	that would probably explain a lot if it is

<applepi>	this has been a huge headache
<fxmulder>	so I have a number of kernels installed, when I run grub-update2 it shows all 5 of them but when I reboot the grub menu only lists 3 of them
<xeon-enouf>	fxmulder: how about symlinks in /  ?   #perhaps the system somehow knows the oldest ones are deprecated?
<xeon-enouf>	fxmulder: are they all vmlinuz* and all reside in /boot?
<xeon-enouf>	hrm.. the menu for grub2 is handled in.. /etc/grub/* or ...check also what /etc/default/grub* mentions, if anything
<xeon-enouf>	i suppose your grub.conf isn't being updated, for whatever reason
<xeon-enouf>	(used to be menu.lst)
<xeon-enouf>	(in grub1)
<pingfloyd>	update-grub should update that
<applepi>	how can I direct a chat script to a port without ppp?
<pingfloyd>	not sure what grub-update2 is
<xeon-enouf>	grub2-update maybe?
<fxmulder>	/usr/sbin/update-grub2 -> update-grub
<xeon-enouf>	is update-grub a symlink?
<pangolinrollin>	^^
<xeon-enouf>	vice-versa
<pangolinrollin>	update-grub
<xeon-enouf>	right
<pingfloyd>	I just always run update-grub and never have a problem
<xeon-enouf>	i think he just typo'd?
<pangolinrollin>	had pleeeenty of grub problems won't be forgetting that any time soon lulz
<pangolinrollin>	turned out to be bad memory :P
*	xeon-enouf RMA's pangolinrollin 's brain
<xeon-enouf>	:-P
*	xeon-enouf takes his own in for a tune-up2
<pangolinrollin>	heyyy now
<pingfloyd>	looks like update-grub is wrapper script for running grub-mkconfig -o
<pingfloyd>	so you could run grub-mkconfig, but you'll need to provide the parameters yourself
<xeon-enouf>	right; then it populates/reads all the /etc/grub/NN-* files
<xeon-enouf>	it's generating a new little binary
<pingfloyd>	it's grub-mkconfig that updates the grub.cfg itself
<hololeap>	i'm looking for a way to mount a filesystem on a dynamically-sized loop file so that when new files are added to the filesystem, the loop file increases its size automatically (kind of like dynamically-sized disks in VirtualBox)
<xeon-enouf>	see that? i even got grub.cfg wrong; i called it grub.conf
<pingfloyd>	in fact he may want to check his update-grub and make sure it's using the correct output parametr
<xeon-enouf>	like a normal person might
<pingfloyd>	exec grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg "$@"
<xeon-enouf>	hololeap: tmpfs
<pingfloyd>	also, did you make sure your /boot isn't mounted ro
<xeon-enouf>	the loop aspect, takes a file, and presents it to the kernel as a block device
<hololeap>	xeon-enouf: can tmpfs be created using a loop file? i thought it was only used for creating a fs in RAM
<xeon-enouf>	maybe you're mounting the file as ro
<xeon-enouf>	there's no loop file; there's loop devices
<xeon-enouf>	man losetup
<hololeap>	xeon-enouf: thanks i'll check it out!
<blt>	Hi! How can I debug hibernation issues? Hibernation works about 75% of the time. The other 25% I just get a black screen after the bootloader.
<Psi-Jack>	blt: Check your kernel logs. And hope.
<blt>	Also, it seems like hibernation issues are correlated with being on battery power.
<Psi-Jack>	Not really any kind of correlation there.
<blt>	Psi-Jack: I'm using systemd, so do you mean checking journalctl
<Psi-Jack>	blt: I mean logs. journalctl accesses logs.
<xeon-enouf>	blt: i recall older issues, with when hibernation wouldn't work properly, unless AC power was plugged
<Psi-Jack>	xeon-enouf: That's actually a *thing*?
<xeon-enouf>	blt: check scripts in /etc/hibernation  or  /etc/acpi/*
<xeon-enouf>	Psi-Jack: i think IIRC
<checkmatein1>	is bazhang 12? like seriously. btw how sad can you get devoting your adult life to opping an "offtopic" IRC channel almost 24/7
<checkmatein1>	get a gf m8 lmao.
<blt>	xeon-enouf: I have neither of those directories on my FS
<xeon-enouf>	blt: try to pay attention to perhaps some device/module is improperly unloading, and order -- like notice; does it happen only when i have Flash / Audio playing/loaded; or a certain app/connection only?
<xeon-enouf>	blt: oh well ; i don't know systemd
<Psi-Jack>	blt: And what braindead distro do you have?
<blt>	Psi-Jack: using archlinux
<Psi-Jack>	That says a lot.
<Psi-Jack>	Fix your sheisa!
<Psi-Jack>	And install laptop-mode-tools
<xeon-enouf>	blt: almost seems like a VGA/VESA, or GPU driver issue?
<Psi-Jack>	And acpid.
<checkmatein1>	Psi-Jack: plz ban bazhang hes trolling in other channels
<blt>	xeon-enouf: i'm using opensource intel video driver
<xeon-enouf>	cpupower; acpi; cpufreqd ... wiki.archlinux.org has good info blt
<checkmatein1>	its passed his bedtime and he forgot to take his meds
<Psi-Jack>	checkmatein1: Sure, I'll get right on that. FRACK OFF!
<xeon-enouf>	blt: well; intel, whilst mostly good.. does have its issues
<xeon-enouf>	many have complained recently about i915 issues
<hololeap>	xeon-enouf: would there be a way to do something similar, except use BTRFS instead of tmpfs? i'm basically trying to leverage the transparent compression of BTRFS so i can rsync to it, without setting up a static-sized volume
<xeon-enouf>	hololeap: too involved for my limited knowledge about those specific FSes and techs
<xeon-enouf>	so, no idea ;-)
<hololeap>	xeon-enouf: ok :)
<blt>	xeon-enouf, Psi-Jack: thanks for the input
<xeon-enouf>	hololeap: i can guesstimate
<xeon-enouf>	hololeap: BTRFS is a COW type, so it's (alterations, dirty pages, etc) in RAM, until written to disk .. so.. that should grow/shrink on its own, IINM
<xeon-enouf>	the compression and rsync thing.. no idea
<hololeap>	xeon-enouf: finding a way to create a dynamically-sized volume written on a file is what i'm struggling with
<hololeap>	xeon-enouf: and maybe there would need to be a way to let btrfs know that the volume size is not fixed
<xeon-enouf>	hololeap: all i can say is there's a #linuxfs (or #linux-fs) channel on here, and/or OFTC.net ... and perhaps there's a #btrfs one somewhere ;-)
<hololeap>	xeon-enouf: everything i've been finding on google points to LVM, which i have never used. i should probably just read up on that
<hololeap>	xeon-enouf: thans
<hololeap>	*thanks
<xeon-enouf>	hololeap: LVM is nice; and an #lvm exists here on freenode
<xeon-enouf>	(even though the tech is lvm2 now, like #v4l, )
<xeon-enouf>	LVM is a virtual block device, and allows for growing/shrinking of what we old people call partitions, and lvm calls volumes -- dynamically? not so much, not without a script i guess, or the utils
<xeon-enouf>	hololeap: ^
<hololeap>	xeon-enouf: ok
<xeon-enouf>	hololeap: i could be wrong; but going the lvm route for your task doesn't seem the proper road; btrfs incorporates many of the lvm tech
<xeon-enouf>	so..
<xeon-enouf>	s/many/much/
<hololeap>	xeon-enouf: it's not a big deal. it's actually for somebody else's question online. i was just curious if there was something that could do this since i might use it in the future
<xeon-enouf>	sure; worthy of following up with -- this is how one learns ;-)
<Krixvar>	Hey all, I somehow broke my network setup a while ago so that I need to run route add default gw 192.168.1.1 every time I log in to get onto the internet.. is there something I can fix in a config file so I don't have to do it?
<heurist>	Krixvar: you could just add that command to /etc/rc.local if you can not get the config fixed

<blocky>	is there a way to portscan myself if I'm behind a nat (i want to see what ports are accessible to someone else behind the nat, but i don't have another computer to test with)

<nitestryker>	gdogg, yes its a kernel command line and its a work around that may get you up and running for the time being
<gdogg>	ok cool
<gdogg>	nitestryker: i think that was a bad log (e.g. this boot)
<nitestryker>	gdogg, let me know how it goes
<gdogg>	sually takes a day to a week for it to crash :/
<nitestryker>	 a read something that someone wrote that said he had the same issue and it was a hardware problem
<gdogg>	might have been me a few weeks ago :)
<gdogg>	might be a hardware problem. What i did last time was ssh to a machine and watch -n 1 sensors to see when it crashed and the temp at the time
<nitestryker>	oh

<ayecee>	lf94: yes
<ayecee>	lf94: and also the config file for your kernel.
<lf94>	hm
<lf94>	how the heck do i get sources on debian <_>
<ayecee>	apt-get source packagename
<lf94>	It's trying to get linux-source-3.16 but I'm running 3.4 kernel
<ayecee>	i think there's also a kernel source package specifically for this kind of thing.
<ayecee>	then you put in the wrong package name
<lf94>	(not a custom kernel)
<lf94>	There are only 3.16,18, and 4.0
<lf94>	I guess using sid will cause these things, hnnng
<lf94>	oh well
<ayecee>	lf94: you'll need to find the package that has your kernel.
<lf94>	Guess I'll upgrade kernels
<ayecee>	that also works

<BrickRoad>	Yo!
<BrickRoad>	So I have a question
<cppking>	can samba be configured like this : anybody can upload but can't delete file
<BrickRoad>	cppking what do you mean by anybody
<cppking>	by guest
<BrickRoad>	On a windows server or linux?
<cppking>	samba run on linux as server, windows client
<BrickRoad>	you can run http://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-smb-server-in-os-x-and-windows-8--mac-46276
<BrickRoad>	fag
<cppking>	I tried to set sticky bit to shared directory then set "force user" , but never make it
<BrickRoad>	cppking - anyway, what is your particular application?
<cppking>	I want to use samba serve a shared folder that guest user without password can upload file into it but after upload can't delete it anymore
<[R]>	there is no such thing as a writable directory that yu can add files to but not remove them
<cppking>	I tried to set "sticky bit" to that shared folder,  then  files uploaded are configured to be owned by 'root' user; but it didn't work
<BrickRoad>	why do you want them to not be able to delete
<[R]>	cppking: because thats not how file deletion works
<BrickRoad>	Yawn slow night, who else has a question
<cppking>	it's a public folder shared by all person in my company,  my leader tell me he want to do it like that (he know little about IT  :< orz)
<BrickRoad>	Tell your leader its not possible
<[R]>	use a web application
<[R]>	oh i know!
<[R]>	write a fuse filesystem
<BrickRoad>	Just move the files out of the directory to a read only directy every minute with a cron
<BrickRoad>	Have one for dropping, and the other for reading
<[R]>	drop it like it's hot
<BrickRoad>	Have 2 shares
<BrickRoad>	like a polaroid picture bitches
<[R]>	i think you might be able to set up a dir you can write to but not read
<[R]>	so you can dro the files but then not see anything
<[R]>	and then wait for it to sync to the other dir
<cppking>	BrickRoad: brilliant
<BrickRoad>	Thank you
<BrickRoad>	Stand back, I am a professional
<[R]>	with my way, anyone etes fucked if they drop the wrong file in htere, which is a bonus
<[R]>	gets*
<[R]>	but i suppose with BrickRoad's way, you can undo your mistakes (at life)
<cppking>	somebody tell me that windows can do it .
<BrickRoad>	That windows can do what?
<cppking>	anybody can upload but cant delete
<ayecee>	windows itself wouldn't do that. that'd be a feature of certain servers, e.g. ftp servers.
<Penguin>	Windows permissions might have such capability, but this isn't a Windows help channel.
<BrickRoad>	^
<BrickRoad>	In other words GTFO cppking
<cppking>	:'(
<BrickRoad>	 /join #windows
<ayecee>	this doesn't seem to involve windows.
<Penguin>	Why did you bring it up?
<ayecee>	Penguin: because context

<mjbjr>	c'mon, it's not exactly like the wires are humming tonight...   sheesh
<Loshki>	DarkElement: for punishment, test it and report back your results here
<DarkElement>	You can't.
<DarkElement>	Sorry.
<DarkElement>	night
<k_sze[work]>	parted's mklabel confuses me somewhat.
<[R]>	k_sze[work]: that sounds unfortunate
<Psi-Jack>	cppking: What, clearly, are you trying to actually do?
<k_sze[work]>	it sounds like mklabel creates a partition table
<Psi-Jack>	k_sze[work]: It does. Sorta.
<BrickRoad>	yawn
<Psi-Jack>	It initializes a partition table type, such as aix, amiga, bsd, dvh, gpt (common), loop, mac, msdos (common), pc98, or sun
<BrickRoad>	amiga!
<Psi-Jack>	For Linux, you want either msdos (most common still), or gpt.
<Psi-Jack>	Hmmm.
<Psi-Jack>	my vimrc is better than yours. :)
<[R]>	thats what she said
<Loshki>	Psi-Jack: my .emacs can beat up your .vimrc anyday...
<Loshki>	k_sze[work]: if you have it, gparted takes care of most everything.
<Psi-Jack>	emacs can't even be a decent enough text editor, let alone an operating system it tries to be.
<Psi-Jack>	Though, if you need psychiatric health.......
<Psi-Jack>	Nevermind, it's not good at that either. :D
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<problema>	Hello all i am about to clone a disk using DD. the disk is filled with zeroes so the image can fit in the destination. The issue is that when i run sudo fdisk -l i get that the disk (sda) has many partitions:    Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System /dev/sdb1   *        2048   974768127   487383040   83  Linux  /dev/sdb2       974770174   976771071     1000449    5  Extended  Partition 2 does not start on physical sector boundary. /dev/
<problema>	sdb5       974770176   976771071     1000448   82  Linux swap / Solaris
<ayecee>	problema: what's the problem with that?
<problema>	if i run dd if=/dev/sda will it take the filesystem too? or should i run it for /dev/sda1 which is where the data is?
<ayecee>	problema: this fdisk seems to be for sdb, not sda.
<BrickRoad>	sda1
<problema>	sorry for that ayecee it is sdb
<ayecee>	it'd probably be better to do the whole thing, /dev/sdb
<problema>	should i do sdb fully or sdb1 which is the only mountable partition
<problema>	okay thanks
<ayecee>	otherwise you're going to have to create the partition table by hand.
<problema>	ahh
<problema>	ayecee: do i have to also copy the mbr?
<ayecee>	if you use sdb, no. if you use sdb1, yes.
<IPhoton>	Hello, I would like to know if there is a way to change the keyboard shortcuts of the gnome-terminal. I already went to edit and keyboard shortcuts but I can't find the one I want. In particularly I want to change the default ctrl+w(delete word) to ctrl+backspace
<IPhoton>	I'm on Ubuntu 14.04
<[R]>	IPhoton: that has nothing to do with gnome-terminal, that's bash
<IPhoton>	oh, and do you know how I would be able to change it?
<[R]>	i'm sure you can find it on google
<problema>	one last question, when i mount the destination disk (ntfs) do i have to add any parameter to the mount command?
<ayecee>	(in other words, don't know)
<problema>	or can i just mount it with mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt/backup
*	explosive is now known as EriC^
<ayecee>	problema: are you making a clone of this disk, or an image?
<problema>	i don't know the difference ayecee
<problema>	i'll run something like this dd if=/dev/hda conv=sync,noerror bs=64K | gzip -c  > /mnt/sda1/hda.img.gz
<ayecee>	problema: do you want the target drive to look like the source drive when you're done?
<problema>	nono
<problema>	its a backup to restore just in case
<problema>	i get what you mean now ayecee it's an image
<ayecee>	you don't need any special mount options then
<problema>	okay thanks again
<ayecee>	IPhoton: heh. turns out it's not even a bash thing, it's a terminal driver thing. the key can be changed with stty. http://superuser.com/questions/160388/change-bash-shortcut-keys-such-as-ctrl-c
<IPhoton>	yeah, I am looking at it now lol
<IPhoton>	stty thing
<IPhoton>	cool
<problema>	how long do you think it can take to do a dd | gzip of a 500gb drive that has 30gb of use?
<problema>	from sata to ide
<MetaNova>	quite a while
<BrickRoad>	A long fucking time
<MetaNova>	quite a very long time
<BrickRoad>	It takes ~5 to 10 minutes to do a 1gb flash drive for me
<BrickRoad>	On a new macbook
<problema>	3 hours is a long time?
<ayecee>	problema: in the neighborhood of 4 hours.
<problema>	ah
<ayecee>	3 hours, sure.
<problema>	i was afraid it would take 12
<problema>	could*
<ayecee>	it still could. the gzip will slow it down.
<ayecee>	maybe.
<problema>	hmm
<problema>	well i will just stare at the wall then
<BrickRoad>	Got any good jokes?
<[R]>	tape is so horribilty inneficient
<[R]>	why did anyone think that was a good idea?
<problema>	yes give me some time to translate
<ayecee>	[R]: for what?
<[R]>	anything!
<[R]>	i was trying to look at what was on a tape
<[R]>	so i spent like hours dumping a list of files on it
<problema>	with tape they cannot move nor talk
<[R]>	and i'm sure it'll be equally awful to pull a file off of it
<password2>	hi
<ayecee>	[R]: serves you right for not having an external index.
<[R]>	and now i gotta rewind it...
<[R]>	ayecee: i'm sure there was an index
<[R]>	but we dont have the computer that made the backup
<[R]>	it was probably on that computer
<ayecee>	probably
<[R]>	regardless
<[R]>	its ridiculous

<peetaur2>	t-ask: for now, use wget with -c to continue (which worked for decades) instead of browsers, etc. which (still in 2015) suck at resume
<peetaur2>	t-ask: maybe mtr will give you an idea of the packet loss and where it happens (mtr is like traceroute, but more friendly)
<t-ask>	Any idea if this is related to my KVM client or or more the privider's host?
<peetaur2>	t-ask: if kvm is at fault for breaking something, it should be consistently broken, not random packets lost
<t-ask>	peetaur2: yes, I used wget and that's when the download freezes, eg
<peetaur2>	t-ask: try this maybe... it fixes stupid ratelimiters that aren't your host:   sudo sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps=0
<mAniAk-_->	freezes and continues?
<peetaur2>	(sysctl commands are temporary; make them permanent in /etc/sysctl.d/)
<t-ask>	THis is an example I experienced yesterday: http://storage1.static.itmages.com/i/15/0430/h_1430383057_5322721_0378350fdf.png
<peetaur2>	t-ask: if it's the rate limiter problem I guessed, then it would be normal for a while, then when you hit your 'soft limit' it throttles  you down rapidly to try to achieve an average 'hard limit', but the concept is horribly flawed because the way TCP works to find the right speed is to measure loss; so changing the loss rate suddenly makes it drop, not lower the speed.
<t-ask>	yes, it continues with wget
<peetaur2>	t-ask: but does it continue right away, or only after wget reconnects?
<t-ask>	wow, I'm currently connected via ssh and key presses also "freeze"...

<FreeFull>	Linux 4.0 time
<peetaur2>	how can you use linux 4.0 if there is no grsec patch for it yet? http://grsecurity.net/
<kahtahs>	peetaur2: is any distro maintaining grsec?
<MrElendig>	kahtahs: lots
<peetaur2>	kahtahs: gentoo has it (and more) officially, and some others have it semi-unofficially
<peetaur2>	but you don't really need any support... just build it and install it, edit your /etc/security/limits.conf and add a /etc/sysctl.d/grsec.conf if you want, and set some xattrs for things that rewuire rwx memory (like java and python)
<peetaur2>	and with some versions of gcc, you need "make ... DISABLE_PAX_PLUGINS=y" or it won't build
<peetaur2>	I use manjaro-openrc on desktops, and also uses grsec with a few Debian, Ubuntu, and used to use it with openSUSE
<Unopoo>	I find if I use right `alt` key plus f, bash won't work to move foward one word, its not a problem using left `alt`

<Penguin>	This is a matter of Alt vs. Alt Gr
<Penguin>	Not trying to provide a solution since there is no problem, just saying.
<FreeFull>	peetaur2: Because I'm not using grsec
<peetaur2>	but then you can't brag to your friends that linux is inherently more secure ...
<peetaur2>	and I believe that all Linux users should have the right to brag
<Unopoo>	Penguin: oh, I didn't know
<peetaur2>	Unopoo: FYI in the plain us english layout, they are the same (which I use and verified it works the same for alt+f), but in the international one, or other languages, they are different
<kahtahs>	peetaur2: how's it more secure when there's X?
<peetaur2>	kahtahs: it is far far more secure, but X is still a huge hole
<peetaur2>	X runs as root ... nothing is safe :D
<peetaur2>	(what is this, 1990?)
<peetaur2>	(*1990's)
<peetaur2>	but for example it prevents buffer overflow exploits and lots of other stuff http://grsecurity.net/compare.php
<MrElendig>	you can run X without root these days
<peetaur2>	so with protection like that, esp. the syscalls being protected, a userland app will have a much tougher time exploiting the kernel, and something confined in apparmor, like firefox should be, will likely never get to touch Xorg or anything as root
<MrElendig>	as long as you are using one of the free drivers
<peetaur2>	MrElendig: oh awesome :) I always use the free drivers.
<kahtahs>	MrElendig: X's main problem isn't that it runs as root
<MrElendig>	new feature in 1.16 or 1.16
<MrElendig>	17*
<MrElendig>	kahtahs: I know
<peetaur2>	having root just means no priv. escalation bugs needed; it has many holes nothing to do with that
<MrElendig>	the main problem is that it is still stuck in 1976
<kahtahs>	peetaur2: why would you care about priv escalation on single-user desktop systems?
<peetaur2>	I have 1.17.1-5 so I guess I'll look into that :)
<peetaur2>	kahtahs: because firefox, etc. don't run as root... and root bypasses any checks
<peetaur2>	kahtahs: it is more work to exploit if you don't already have root
<MrElendig>	peetaur2: requres you to use startx currently, as none of the DMs works if not started as root
<MrElendig>	peetaur2: see Xorg.wrap(1)
<peetaur2>	kahtahs: 3 layers of protection is not 3x the protection, but more like protection^3 ... it is significant.
<kahtahs>	peetaur2: what checks are you speaking of?
<peetaur2>	hassoon: like chmod ugo= somefile;  root can read the file.. doesn't matter that nobody can read it
<peetaur2>	and the cap for that is called DAC_OVERRIDE
<peetaur2>	"override" as in bypass, not pay attention to any settings
<peetaur2>	root doesn't bypass apparmor though... and any process spawned from another inherits the parent profile, even sudo
<peetaur2>	(a kernel exploit may bypass apparmor... so that's why the other security features are important)
<peetaur2>	one of these describes an exploit that bypasses selinux, and turns it off in such a way that the admin checking status will see it's on even though it's not.  https://grsecurity.net/~spender/exploits/exploit.txt  https://grsecurity.net/~spender/exploits/exploit2.txt
<kahtahs>	peetaur2: you use apparmor?
<peetaur2>	kahtahs: yes; grsec RBAC doesn't do child nesting in a way I consider good enough for "least priviledge policy", so I use apparmor plus grsec without RBAC
<peetaur2>	and grsec RBAC can't do learning while in enforcing mode :(  apparmor is great for that, so you can even run skype in it without it breaking things during learning ;)
<kahtahs>	peetaur2: which recent Firefox CVEs did that setup migate?
<Filystyn>	guys can i put two commands in console and than after one is executed next one will be?
<Filystyn>	or should i write a bash script lelelelelelele
<peetaur2>	kahtahs: it won't mitigate a thing like SSL being broken, but it will prevent it from attacking other processes, files, devices, etc.
<Filystyn>	i only need  two commands at once  ;-)
<gagalicious>	is there a way to make sure my disk doesnt get filled up ever?
<peetaur2>	kahtahs: so that recent one where a fake site can redirect you to the original SSL cert so you think it's valid and then you use the fake cert for encryption will not be prevented
<gagalicious>	i would like to reserve 3% to a mounted directory and would like to limit my docker container from ever filling it up to 100%
<peetaur2>	gagalicious: monitoring is the only perfect way... but other strategies involve quotas or separate filesystems
<peetaur2>	gagalicious: a separate filesystme for things growing out of control (/var, /home, etc.), or a separate one for things you don't want damaged by others going out of control (/)
<gagalicious>	peetaur2 : actually it's already a separate filesystem that i wish will never get filled up. how do i make sure that?
<gagalicious>	it's /mnt/btrfs
<peetaur2>	and maybe cgroups (process based) might be more useful than quotas (filesystem and user based) for docker.
<peetaur2>	gagalicious: oh with btrfs, it should be easy to use a quota since it's easy to separate it as a filesystem using subvols
<gagalicious>	my docker is running as root
<gagalicious>	so i cant use quota on it..
<peetaur2>	docker is retarded that way... but you don't have to use the default container type; you can use others that support non-root
<peetaur2>	and the btrfs devs recommend cgroups for subvols, but I don't really know how that works
<rtb>	is it safe to use   wget --post-data 'username=foo&password' http://remote  ... will somebody be able to read the credentials? what are the security violations i m committing?
<spreeuw>	any mitm
<spreeuw>	and whoever has read access to the script
<peetaur2>	rtb: yes with http instead of https, it's all plain text; with https, only the handshake and tcp headers are public
<rtb>	peetaur2, spreeuw thanks.
<rtb>	so i better use https ... hope wget supports it
<peetaur2>	yes it does
<spreeuw>	i forget if https masks the uri
<Haxxa>	so I know this is a linux support thread so simply hit me if I am out of line but I have a question about installing a linux script (basic permissions/cp questions) that #android-root # cyanogenmod etc. could not seem to answer so I thought here might be the next best bet is this ok or maybe pm or something else if not I'm sorry - its an android phone but linux related
<MrElendig>	this is not a thread at all
<Haxxa>	ops
<Haxxa>	meant channel
<spreeuw>	android is insane
<peetaur2>	the whole query including uri is after the handshake stuff is done and encrypted; the problem with GET instead of POST and HTTPS is only that the browser has it in the history, not that it's not encrypted on the wire
<Haxxa>	I had injection 2 hours ago bit werid at the moment

<Haxxa>	brb
<kahtahs>	peetaur2: >it will prevent it from attacking other processes, files, devices <- files: ff isn't allowed to override files when downloading? devices: ff isn't allowed to talk to X?
<spreeuw>	Haxxa: fine dont expect an answer to your unasked q though
<peetaur2>	kahtahs: it will be able to use whatever hackish broken apis are required yes, but it won't be able to roam free in user memory without first exploiting X
<peetaur2>	kahtahs: for devices I meant like the microphone, webcam, etc. unless it can get to those indirectly like through X exploits
<peetaur2>	kahtahs: if it talks to another already running unconfined process, then it might escape confinement that way; but if it has to use its own process or spawn processes to reach things like the microphone, it should be blocked
<peetaur2>	just like if you give it outgoing tcp access like you need for http, it could also attack localhost:22 to get at ssh. (and I think selinux can limit by port number, but apparmor can't yet)
<Haxxa>	spreeuw, I expect linux gurus to use open source voodoo technology to read minds - I mean c'mon tech should be able to do that these days

<leeyaa>	is it possible to change permissions for a file from nobody:nobody to web:web without giving the user sudo access ?
<peetaur2>	kahtahs: I don't want to use mic or webcam in firefox, so my apparmor profile forbids it (and anything else in /dev and /sys)
<MrElendig>	leeyaa: you need root to chown anything you don't own so no
<MrElendig>	unless you run some deamon and tell it to do it
<Haxxa>	yer
<peetaur2>	kahtahs: a profile is a whitelist... if you don't list an exception, it can't use whatever file it wants
<MrElendig>	I smell a XYproblem though
<leeyaa>	MrElendig: yeah just wondering. one of my scripts stopped working
<MrElendig>	are you trying to set correct permissions on files in some upload dir?
<peetaur2>	leeyaa: if you own the dir it is in, mv the file away, and then cat > newfile to take ownership :) but usually no, need root

<TeraJL>	hi there, i'm encrypting a file with GPG, i do "gpg -c file.txt" and it askes for a password and encrypts, but when i do "gpg teste.txt.gpg" i get "gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase" but it decrypts without asking for a password, where does it keeps the password?
<MrElendig>	kahtahs: but you should use chromium
<MrElendig>	kahtahs: since it is actually open source
<peetaur2>	kahtahs: and inferior to IE? hah I highly doubt it... I doubt they even have any sane isolation
<MrElendig>	IE is dead
<MrElendig>	even MS realised how bad it was and decided to kill it off
<eirirs>	haha url?
<leeyaa>	MrElendig: and replace it with another crappy browser
<peetaur2>	TeraJL: maybe gpg-agent remembered it
<MrElendig>	eirirs: read up on their new spartan browser
<kahtahs>	MrElendig: even arch linux has like 5 days delays for new chromium builds compared to chrome
<MrElendig>	eirirs: and if you manage to exploit it you can get up to 130k usd
<peetaur2>	cp IE.git BLahSUperbrowser.git     there IE is killed off and we have a new browser!
<MrElendig>	eirirs: as a reward
<eirirs>	challenge accepted
<MrElendig>	kahtahs: build yourself then
<MrElendig>	or maybe it was 130k nok
<eirirs>	and now again, adios spartan
<MrElendig>	whatever
<eirirs>	http://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-edge-unveiled/
<MrElendig>	free money!
<MrElendig>	oh they renamed it
<MrElendig>	yay
<eirirs>	IE -> ME browser
<peetaur2>	windows ME browser?
<leeyaa>	still crap
<MrElendig>	hmm it was 130k nok
<MrElendig>	15000 usd
<MrElendig>	https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dn972323?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396
<kahtahs>	MrElendig: not really an option. chromium is neihter easy nor fast to build
<MrElendig>	kahtahs: it is not that bad to build, really
<MrElendig>	kahtahs: and it is quite easy to build
<eirirs>	chrome is annoying, had to kill and restart chrome daily on a pc with 8GB RAM
<Anthaas>	What is the threshold for /usr/bin/time? is it 0.0005 which will be rounded to 0.001, or is it 0.0006, or is it simple 0.001?
<MrElendig>	kahtahs: specially on arch, since people have written the PKGBUILD for you already
<eirirs>	but with a laptop with 32GB RAM its no prob lol
<MrElendig>	:p
<Anthaas>	Basically what time should a process take such that timing it would change from 0.000 to 0.001
<MrElendig>	Anthaas: system spesific
<kahtahs>	MrElendig: fedora still doesn't package chromium because of their bundled library insanities. not that ff is much better
<Anthaas>	Bugger.
<Anthaas>	MrElendig: Any idea how I can find out for my system?
<MrElendig>	kahtahs: you can use system libs for msot
<MrElendig>	most*
<leeyaa>	kahtahs: i use mac with 4gb of ram. i use chrome ff and safari at the same time. all have 15+ tabs open all the time. you probably had system configuration issue
<MrElendig>	-Duse_system_whatever=1
<MrElendig>	works for most of the libs
<MrElendig>	ffmpeg can be troublesome
<eirirs>	MrElendig: so, are you feeling elendig today? :P
<kahtahs>	MrElendig: besides, what do you really gain from using Chromium? is there anything in Chrome that you can't turn off?
<MrElendig>	kahtahs: you don't know
<MrElendig>	no one but google knows what crud they trow in it
<ayecee>	kahtahs: one advantage is one less third party repository
<MrElendig>	and depending on your system you can get better performance
<MrElendig>	and better intigration with your de
<kahtahs>	< MrElendig> and depending on your system you can get better performance <- how?
<ayecee>	by using compile options that sane people wouldn't use
<ayecee>	and then measuring the performance increase using the butt dyno
<ayecee>	"feels faster!"
<MrElendig>	things like sse4 etc can actually make a messurable difference for browsers
<ayecee>	it doesn't make a noticeable difference, though.
<peetaur2>	compling makes it faster though.... this is how: compiling takes long, so you feel like the comptuer is slow, then when you can actually use it again, it is faster in your perception
<peetaur2>	use flags are helpful for that too
<MrElendig>	ayecee: it actually can be noticable
<ayecee>	nice
<kahtahs>	MrElendig: looked at arch's pkgbuild. they are using google's bundled toolchain for PNaCl..
<peetaur2>	proprietary toolchain? or open?
<peetaur2>	that would be stupid if it wasn't open :D
<kahtahs>	peetaur2: should be open
<kahtahs>	peetaur2: are you building ff yourself to get pie?
<peetaur2>	kahtahs: no, but that's on my long list of things to look into... pie is believed to be a significant benefit
<peetaur2>	kahtahs: I think gentoo-hardened has both grsec and pie fully supported
<mooncheese>	Hi , has someone managed to successfully copy a working application from one Linux system, ( Including needed dynamic and static libs ) onto a new Linux system in a kind of chroot jail?
<peetaur2>	mooncheese: if you copy the entire root fs, that usually works... only problem is sometimes a super old/new kernel won't work with some executables/libs
<heurist>	mooncheese: maybe something like docker or rocket?
<MrElendig>	mooncheese: no need for a jail
<MrElendig>	mooncheese: there is this invention named "package managers"
<mooncheese>	the app in question is skype running with it's i386 libs. The destination would be a 64 bit system.
<MrElendig>	mooncheese: that people use all the time
<angevin>	I'm using the kde spin version of linux mint. If I remove the kde packages and install kde plasma 5.3 from it -- will that mess up my system ?
<angevin>	oops
<angevin>	I'm using the kde spin version of linux mint. If I remove the kde packages and install kde plasma 5.3 from a kubuntu from it -- will that mess up my system ?
<angevin>	a kubuntu repository that is
<MrElendig>	mooncheese: that allows you to build packages on one system, and copy/install/run them on some other system
<MrElendig>	mooncheese: it is like magic
<angevin>	I'm used to using shit slackware were I can just install anything I want
<angevin>	things like mint and ubuntu are more restricted and confined
<triceratux>	angevin: me too. when i instll kde stuff on slack i pull it from opensuse repos. as for mint, before you try anything with plasma 5.3 bounce it off the mintsters on spotchat
<afx237>	can a regular linux distro be installed in a openvz container like a normal OS install?  or do you need to use some special openvz enabled image?
<mooncheese>	MrElendig: The thing with docker is I think it needs to image the entire system, which would be a bit too big as I just need the files and libs for skype. I guess and a minmal kernel.
<angevin>	triceratux: alright
<MrElendig>	mooncheese: I never mentioned docker
<mooncheese>	also Idk if docker / rocket would "talk" to the 64 bit system's X and window manager.
<MrElendig>	a simple package would solve this
<MrElendig>	in fact most distroes ships skype to begin with so.....
<mooncheese>	lol right
<MrElendig>	most sane distroes do
<angevin>	mooncheese: linux mint doesn't have skype installed by default but it is of course in the repositories
<spreeuw>	what's skype?
<angevin>	spreeuw: you are kidding right ?
<spreeuw>	mikersoft nsa backdoor
<spreeuw>	no thanks
<mooncheese>	I don't think you understand my intentions. I have a working skype i want to move it to other system without fucking up the OS and mixing in all the i386 shit skype needs.
<angevin>	spreeuw: the NSA has backdoors in hardware now like hard drives so I've given up on trying to evade the reach of the NSA. I used to run OpenBSD and then I just gave up
<triceratux>	angevin: whats the story on slack support for kde 5.3 ? why are you messing with mint ?
<angevin>	spreeuw: or the firmware of the hardware
<spreeuw>	openbsd had a backdoored ip stack
<spreeuw>	by nsa
<spreeuw>	I know of the firmwares yes
<eirirs>	now its in the cleptographic crypto
<spreeuw>	using freedom software to access them helps
<eirirs>	kleptography
<spreeuw>	if you hand the corrupt firmware encrypted blocks to store
<angevin>	spreeuw: no it didn't you idiot. Someone claimed the NSA had a backdoor in OpenBSD's IPSEC but they reviewed the code and it wasn't true
<spreeuw>	it cand decode them
<redwall_hp>	The sad part is Skype used to be an encrypted peer-to-peer system, then Microsoft centralized it after they bought it, ostensibly to put the now-famous backdoor in
<kahtahs>	angevin: language
<redwall_hp>	Every Skype client acted as a relay for Skype traffic when idle
<c-->	a system got stuck, i'm not sure why (possibly java process), its still pingable but ssh login freezes right after the password prompt - how could i get to this system to kill whatever is freezing it up?
<angevin>	triceratux: I was using slackware-current and it was too unstable and I was too lazy to build my own ISO wth a new kernel so I just wanted something that worked out the box for a change
<mooncheese>	I want to put skype in its own little jail. A special place for it. :)
<angevin>	triceratux: so I installed fedora and didn't like it so then I installed linux mint
<spreeuw>	debian8 is ok
<angevin>	triceratux: that is why I am messing with mint
<spreeuw>	on my ati laptop it now works bug free
<spreeuw>	upstream had worked for multiple years bugfree already
<spreeuw>	but now debian is there also
*	triceratux genuinely wonders if 5.3 runs anywhere yet or if its only on the kde site lol
<angevin>	triceratux: even linus uses distros that work out the box
<kahtahs>	angevin: but mint has hardly any supported packages now since it's based on ubuntu lts and canonical only maintains their small main repo for 5 years
<angevin>	triceratux: linus doesn't use shit like slackware and debian
<spreeuw>	using skype is living on the edge bros
<spreeuw>	with all the local linux priv esc exploits to root
<spreeuw>	theres a couple per year
<spreeuw>	and then ms owns your box
<eirirs>	I got a separate vlan for microsoft boxes
<spreeuw>	and nsa jeh johnson and the rest of the obama junta
<kahtahs>	< spreeuw> with all the local linux priv esc exploits to root <- why would you care much about those on a single user desktop system?
<angevin>	kahtahs: it has more packages than slackware and slackware is what I am used to so it seems to have alot of packages to me
<angevin>	kahtahs: it is subjective I guess
<spreeuw>	kahtahs: because you dont run as root normally
<spreeuw>	and because you run skype as the user
<kahtahs>	spreeuw: but local user basically already can do everything and owns all your important files
<spreeuw>	which can get root permisisons without you knowing
<spreeuw>	kahtahs: thats true yes
<spreeuw>	all the more reason not to use skype
<angevin>	spreeuw: the NSA probably has a backdoor in SElinux too but I don't see you bitching about that which is worse in my opinion since it is part of the kernel
<spreeuw>	I dont use their fake security
<angevin>	spreeuw: me either I use grsecurity kernel patches
<spreeuw>	all government touched stuff is compromised
<mooncheese>	spreeuw:  Some of us do need Skype for employment reasons from time to time.
<spreeuw>	and thats all big .coms
<spreeuw>	in fascist usa
<angevin>	spreeuw: yeah but now that the NSA has backdoors in hardware or the firmware in hardware it is kind of pointless to try to avoid them at the software level. I essentially gave up on trying to evade the NSA
<kahtahs>	angevin: just be aware of packages not from the main repo as those won't get any security/bugfixes now. on ubuntu you could check with ubuntu-support-status
<kahtahs>	angevin: IOMMU can protect against malicous hw to some extent
<angevin>	kahtahs: I'm not using official-package-repositories.list with apt
<triceratux>	the usa libertarian kleptocracy : "you either worship john galt or youll be worshiping john frum"
*	peetaur2 compiles custom (grsec) kernels with selinux disabled
<angevin>	triceratux: yeah right I wish it was libertarian it is more like liberal with socialist tendencies
<angevin>	at least right now under obama
<kahtahs>	peetaur2: linux 3.14 then?
<angevin>	triceratux: if the USA was libertarian there would be no NSA spying in its citizens etc..
<peetaur2>	kahtahs: I use 3.14 or whatever grsec calls stable on production machines, and 3.19 or whatever grsec calls test on my desktops
<angevin>	kahtahs: oops I meant I'm only using official-package-repositories.list with apt
<angevin>	sorry
<angevin>	I will say one thing though. The package manager in mint deleted an important package for internet access and to fix it was more convoluted and harder than fixing something in slackware
<angevin>	slackware is very transparent and easy to fix things when it breaks not so much these userfriendly distros
<kahtahs>	i wouldn't call mint userfriendly when it has security updates disabled by default
<angevin>	kahtahs: well I enabled them
<angevin>	also since there is no dependency checking in slackware it would have never deleted the important package in the first place
<kahtahs>	angevin: which package was it?
<angevin>	kahtahs: well you see since linux is poorly documented I couldn't get my wireless working from the command line although I can easily do it in OpenBSD or FreeBSD. So mint deleted network manager or wicd so I had no access to the internet to reinstall any packages or that one
<angevin>	kahtahs: also mint wouldn't add my cdrom to the package manager for some reason
<angevin>	kahtahs: also mint doesn't simply have packages you can install from the cdrom from the command line a slackware CD
<angevin>	kahtahs: I had to boot into the livecd environment unencrypt my hard disk from the commandline and mount the lvm partitions. Download the package from the livecd environment then move it to the mounted partitions
<angevin>	then chroot into the mounted partitions to install it
<angevin>	kahtahs: do you know how convoluted and retarded that is compared to fixing something on slackware ?
<angevin>	kahtahs: fixing shit in slackware is like 1000 times easier
<eirirs>	is slackware still being maintained?
<angevin>	eirirs: yes
<super_mrwu>	eirirs: seems
<eirirs>	ok thought it stopped
<angevin>	eirirs: why did you think that ?
<eirirs>	last time i used slack were like v8 or so
<eirirs>	angevin: that maintainer got sick or something
<super_mrwu>	eirirs: as it possess the longest history comparing to other distro
<angevin>	eirirs: that was a long time ago he is better now
<kahtahs>	angevin: not sure i can agree. you basically removed a core package because you didn't recognize it as such due to familiarity with "legacy" systems
<angevin>	kahtahs: I didn't remove it retard. Apt removed it as part of a dependency of another package
<kahtahs>	pastebin apt.log
<peetaur2>	uh oh here come the big guns
<angevin>	kahtahs: the apt logs are obviously deficient because my system shows that I have the connman package deinstalled but it doesn't show it in the logs
<angevin>	kahtahs: anyway I'm pretty sure it happened when I delted connman the E17 network manager package
<angevin>	*deleted
<|read|>	Hello there, does anyone here know how to install GRUB within a LVM partition?
<|read|>	I can't seem to find any detailed doc's on it.
<meandrain>	hi
<|read|>	Hi meandrain
<angevin>	|read|: that is because linux documentation sucks
<meandrain>	are there any linux distro that boot directly to 64 bit? (no 32 bit grub) ?
<peetaur2>	|read|: if you mean for bare metal to boot from it, it is likely impossible / does not make sense
<|read|>	angevin: That's the first time I've heard someone say that.
<peetaur2>	|read|: but if you mean you want rootfs (good idea) or boot (not recommended) to be on lvm, that is fine, but then you "install grub" to the main disk, eg. /dev/sda
<angevin>	|read|: it is quite obvious when you compare the documentation of FreeBSD or OpenBSD to linux  that the linux documentation is vasly inferior
<peetaur2>	|read|: he's just in a bad mood because of some wifi issue
<|read|>	peetaur2: Well, I hear there is a way to put the /boot inside a LVM partition and have it work. I've got it working with /boot on a seperate ESP, but that's not what I'm after.
<angevin>	peetaur2: no that was days ago I'm just speaking the truth. I'm not going to tell some white lies
<peetaur2>	|read|: /boot on lvm is supposed to work... but I have found it unreliable sometimes (like with degraded raid, or something special)
<peetaur2>	|read|: and to do it, just set it up in the installer...
<|read|>	peetaur2: Where are the doc's located? I went to the GNU/GRUB main page and couldn't find anything relevent.
<peetaur2>	it should know where to install things just based on how you did the partitioning
<peetaur2>	|read|: the gnu.org pages should be the most complete, but likely the longest and most time consuming to use
<peetaur2>	|read|: but how are you getting started? a normal installer? arch installer? or converting an old system (which is not easy)?
<peetaur2>	(and I have tried and never had a clean solution .... always had to custom write some initrd scripts)
<|read|>	peetaur2: I'm trying my hand at gentoo. I'm using the minimal installer.
<|read|>	peetaur2: Pretty similar to Arch so far, but im early in the process.
<BluesKaj>	yup peetaur2, my experience with lvm was far from positive and had to rely on ananke to help me get rid of it , wasn't able to boot my other OS on another hdd
<peetaur2>	you mean you have to edit the initramfs conf to add modules/hooks, partition and pvcreate, etc. yourself?
<peetaur2>	BluesKaj: lvm is great though... just GRUB doesn't handle it that well (or raid other than raid1 metadata <=1.0); it is great on rootfs and others, just not boot for grub to mount it
*	stuff2 is now known as bruxC
<peetaur2>	(the trick about raid1 btw is that even if grub had absolutely no raid support, it would just open it as a normal disk, and that would be true since raid1 is identical copies)
<BluesKaj>	peetaur2: yup I found that out the hard way :)
<|read|>	peetaur2: Well, there is an automated installer for grub. I've been using other bootloaders prior to this.
<Lopson>	Hi everyone, is there a way to check the size of the disk cache?
<peetaur2>	Lopson: free -m
<morsnowski>	I have a question about rss aggregators. I seem to be to blonde to find what I'm looking for. What I'm looking for is an app that takes multiple RSS feeds and provides a new RSS feed containing the base RSS feeds. If that makes sense.
<Lopson>	Oh, so it's THAT simple! Okay, thanks peetaur2!
<|read|>	heh, I dont even know what a disk cache is. :(
*	|read| googles hard.
<peetaur2>	|read|: http://linuxatemyram.com/
<Lopson>	It's the cache that stores blocks from a block device.
<watmm>	Has anyone ever tested the benefit/overhead of mysql's query cache before?
<|read|>	peetaur2: haha, thanks. :)
<triceratux>	angevin: the nsa is a transnational entity which is neither a corporation nor an ngo. its not the "big government" libertarianism claims to be against, in fact their attitude perpetuates it. & yes my understanding is pat is feeling fine these days. slack 14.1 rocks
<|read|>	<o>_<o>
<peetaur2>	triceratux: it is not "the government", but a division of goverment, and it is not restricted properly despite what we know about it, so government is still even at fault, so libertarians would still be against both
*	|read| is now known as |read|AFK
<Psi-Jack>	|read|AFK: Please.. Stop... That... Nick Change....
<g0ts1ck>	guys if you have domain, can you create virtual subdomains ?
<g0ts1ck>	on it
<g0ts1ck>	for example i have domain my.domain.com
<Psi-Jack>	g0ts1ck: Well, d'uh yep yep.
<g0ts1ck>	can i create great.my.domain.com ?
<Psi-Jack>	And that's not virtual. That's actual subdomains. :p
<g0ts1ck>	what is the diff beetwen sub and virtual ?
<Psi-Jack>	One's real, one's simulated. :p
<g0ts1ck>	simulated how ?
*	Psi-Jack sighs.
<peetaur2>	g0ts1ck: maybe a redirect or proxy
<Psi-Jack>	g0ts1ck: You're mixing up subdomains with virtual hosts, and thinking they're both the same thing.
<peetaur2>	I would never use one, and thought the ones I saw were redirects, so I don't know much about them
<morsnowski>	anybody for the rss aggregator question or maybe a link to the right channel?
<g0ts1ck>	can i create on my subdomain, more subdomains ?
<triceratux>	peetaur2: you just proved my point. libertarians would be in an awkward position calling for *more* government to restrict the nsa. their position is laudable, but the entities in question wont just evaporate overnight
<Psi-Jack>	g0ts1ck: Do you have an actual Linux question?
<g0ts1ck>	my.domain.com, can i create whats.my.domain.com ?
<Psi-Jack>	g0ts1ck: Do you have an actual Linux question?
<g0ts1ck>	anyone ?
<peetaur2>	triceratux: there doesn't need to be more though... the constitution already forbids a huge amount of what they do
<t-ask>	Hi, I'm looking for a mail server solution which is easy to deploy for small offices. Later I can imagine to use it with a webmail+groupware solution. I'm looking into Dovecot, Courier MTA or Postfix. Do have any other suggestions?
<Psi-Jack>	g0ts1ck: Off-topic. Try ##networking
<peetaur2>	triceratux: and yeah if they didn't evaporate last year (depsite pretty much treason, which is the 2nd highest offense that exists), then they won't likely ever
<Psi-Jack>	t-ask: Postfix + Dovecot
<rascul>	ugh politics talk
*	triceratux evaporates :)
<t-ask>	Besides Postfix+Dovecot... and suggestions for a small groupware/webmail solution which I can later adopt to them?
<t-ask>	Maybe there is one, I didn't notice
<Psi-Jack>	t-ask: postfix+dovecot for the main mailsystem. if you want webui admin for accounts and all-virtual users, postfix.admin. GroupWare with WebMail: Horde, or just webmail: Roundcube.
<Psi-Jack>	t-ask: Pre-canned solutions? There's Zimbra, but you'll need to pay for it eventually.
<Psi-Jack>	t-ask: There's also Scalix, also payware.
<t-ask>	Psi-Jack: great. I was just curious I missed something, because yesterday I found http://modoboa.org and I thought maybe there are more of the kind.
<Psi-Jack>	t-ask: There's a few out there. Google.
<rascul>	i've had good experiences with modoboa in the past
<Hafydd>	I'm planning to make a HD partition for sharing data between Windows and Arch Linux, so I'm considering one of VFAT, ExFAT or NTFS for its filesystem. I understand that these would all work, to some degree, but also that VFAT might have some unwelcome limitations, ExFAT's support on Linux might be limited, and NTFS has portability issues with, for example, Mac OS (which I might conceivably want to use in the future with the same partition). Does ...
<Hafydd>	... anyone have advice on what FS I should use?
<t-ask>	BTw do I actually need Postfix for a ten people office or can I use Dovecot only then (with its LTA)?
<Psi-Jack>	t-ask: Postfix is needed for SMTP.
<Hafydd>	The partition will be about 1 TB, and might hold files up to several GB in size. I'd also like to have symbolic links, if possible.
<Psi-Jack>	t-ask: Dovecot provides IMAP and POP3, and a few other things. So, yes, you need both.
<peetaur2>	Hafydd: the local mac guy here seems to like all 3 fine, but lately more exfat. and exfat fuse works fine probably... have you had issues?
<peetaur2>	Hafydd: last week he asked me to make him an exfat 8TB disk because his mac couldn't or something, so I did that on linux.
<Hafydd>	peetaur2: I haven't tried it, but I know that the spec for ExFAT hasn't been published.
<peetaur2>	Hafydd: yeah M$ even wants to sue people for their right to compatibility; but it doesn't stop people from implementing it anyway :P
<rascul>	t-ask lda you mean? you still need a mta
<peetaur2>	(just like they tried with vfat long ago)
<rascul>	t-ask http://wiki2.dovecot.org/LDA
<peetaur2>	the law in the west basically says that anything goes for compatibility, except copying the actual licensed code to someone without the license; so maybe that means patents don't count either
*	rascul is the law
<t-ask>	rascul: oh, I see it's for local delivery only. so, it's clear now Postfix+Dovecot first :)
<rascul>	also note that it mentions to use lmtp instead of lda
<Psi-Jack>	It has both, technically. :)
<Psi-Jack>	the LDA is like procmail, and LMTP is LMTP. (watered down minimal SMTP-like protocol for local mail transport)
<Psi-Jack>	And Dovecot also has sieve.. Which is great stuff.
<rascul>	yeah
<rascul>	i sieve so hard
<Psi-Jack>	I do too.
<rascul>	some mail clients don't support the sieving :(
<rascul>	roundcube and kmail both do, though
<rascul>	as does modoboa
<drwx>	hi, i need assistance debugging a strange issue that causes calls to fcntl(-1, F_GETFL)
<drwx>	it happened just after an update
<Psi-Jack>	And horde too.
<drwx>	and causes bash to stop working, so i'm using dash to debug
<rascul>	Psi-Jack quit hording all the mail
<drwx>	i don't understand if there's an issue with libc or something
<peetaur2>	drwx: a normal supported update, or an update with 3rd party repos, backports, other releases mixed in, etc.?
<Psi-Jack>	Though, I should probably look at modoboa. Horde's extremely nice though. Supports all the DAV protocols for Calendars, Contacts, etc.
<peetaur2>	and fedora where everything breaking is normal, or a real distro?
<t-ask>	should I go for IMAP or POP3 with ssl?
<Psi-Jack>	IMAP
<Psi-Jack>	With SSL
<drwx>	peetaur2: a very normal update of ubuntu precise, i didn't install the server but it looks sane to me
<t-ask>	but leeping mails ion clients offline is possible?
<Psi-Jack>	Hmmm., modoboa is python.. Nice.
<Psi-Jack>	t-ask: What?
<drwx>	peetaur2: i just don't understand what causes all the bad file descriptors
<rascul>	t-ask mail client can download mail for offline use via imap, yes
<t-ask>	I want cleints to be able to use their mails offlicne (like with pop3). It's possible with IMAP, too, I guess.
<t-ask>	sounds I'm pretty done with planning .)
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<rascul>	you think that now, just wait until you start configuring postfix
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<Psi-Jack>	That's the FUN part. :)
<t-ask>	hehe .)
<Psi-Jack>	rascul: So you've used modoboa?
<t-ask>	I expect it's not as horrible as sendmail was a decade ago :)
<rascul>	Psi-Jack for some amount of time in the past, yes
<cldbeadctv>	postfix is quite easy really
<cldbeadctv>	unless you want something unusual
<rascul>	i'll likely move back to modoboa in due time
<peetaur2>	drwx: do you have a log or screenshot or something with more description?
<greenit>	hi, i currently use firefox as my main browser in linux, but i'd like to try alternatives. can you recommend some?
<t-ask>	I just need aliases, but I saw Dovecot has plugin for it
<peetaur2>	greenit: iceweasel
<rascul>	greenit chromium, midori, rekonq are a few
<drwx>	peetaur2: i can strace what happens when i try to run bash?
<Psi-Jack>	t-ask: What?
<t-ask>	Psi-Jack: Mial aliases
<Psi-Jack>	t-ask: Aliases are done at postfix. :p
<evanton>	greenit: trying alternatives for the sake of trying alternatives or do you have more specific requirements?
<greenit>	peetaur2: iceweasel is firefox without branding....
<Psi-Jack>	Not the mail storage level.
<rascul>	dovecot has an alias plugin, though
<peetaur2>	greenit: why do you want an alternative? web pages these days are still not properly compliant with standards, so lesser known ones like rekonq won't work everywhere
<t-ask>	Psi-Jack: ok, evene better .)
<rascul>	but yeah, do it with postfix, not dovecot
<greenit>	evanton: no real requirements. html5 should work and flash wouldn't be bad ;)
<Psi-Jack>	postfix is going to be the thing to reject the mail for unknown recipients afterall.
<Psi-Jack>	If you do it at dovecot, postfix accepts /ALL/ mail, even invalid mail, thus you will get bounces back to infinity eventually.
<greenit>	rascul: thanks :)
<evanton>	greenit: as vim user, I'm very happy with vimprobable2 as alternative lightweight browser. I don't have any flash on my linux system for years, so I can't comment on that part
<Psi-Jack>	And that's not what yoiu want. :)
<Psi-Jack>	rascul: Looks like Modoboa does primarily just mail, but combines webmail, calendar, and mail management all in one thing, where-as with my setup I have now, I use postfix.admin to manage my mailserver domains/mailboxes, and horde to access the mail (at least, my wife uses the horde, I use IMAP)
<peetaur2>	drwx: I'm not sure that would help me figure it out. I would rather see some error during the update, or after running apt again. Maybe you could dpkg -l 2 machines and compare to see what is different.
<rascul>	Psi-Jack yeah, it's nice that it's like an all in one thing
<Psi-Jack>	rascul: But, I don't see the one feature... Address books or Contacts.
<rascul>	i remember it being fairly lightweight though and sometimes common features weren't implemented
<e^0>	other than awesome wm which are other wm worth to give a try ?
<evanton>	e^0: tiling ones?
<Psi-Jack>	e^0: fvwm2, windowmaker
<e^0>	evanton: yes
<Psi-Jack>	kwin4, kwin5
<evanton>	e^0: I believe at least dwm, xmonad and i3 have their own decent communities
<Psi-Jack>	xfwm
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<t-ask>	I assume, I use Postfix for spam handling
<Psi-Jack>	t-ask: No.
<evanton>	e^0: for such question one usually goes to wikipedia, finds a big list of similar software and starts trying
<Psi-Jack>	You use dspam or spamassasin via postfix.
<e^0>	sometimes i think for multihead setup tiling wm becomes much less important..
<evanton>	applies to greenit's question above
<rascul>	Psi-Jack the docs say that modoboa's radicale plugin does both caldav and carddav
<rascul>	https://modoboa-radicale.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
<t-ask>	Psi-Jack: ok, that's what I ment. dspam is new to me
<rascul>	or maybe i misread it a little
<Psi-Jack>	rascul: Hmm.. Cool. That's all I needed, then. I just didn't see "contacts" in screenshots, or the features listing.
<drwx>	peetaur2: well libc was updated but i can't downgrade it now
<Psi-Jack>	Hmm
<rascul>	Psi-Jack yeah, nor did i
<Psi-Jack>	Maybe so. Radicale supports CalDAV and CardDAV, but.. They only implement calendars, it looks like.
<Psi-Jack>	Hmmm. There's also mailinabox.email, which is basically owncloud+roundcube+.... some control panel.
<t-ask>	Psi-Jack: ther is also kolab.org
<Psi-Jack>	... yeah... There's that....
<Psi-Jack>	Heh, I was more looking for some kind of owncloud+webmail integration, myself.
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<t-ask>	While Kolab is quite to big for my intention... nevertheless, I fear I end up with almost the same .)
<Psi-Jack>	Though, I might look into kolab again, looks like they've made huge changes since I last looked, like incorporating roundcube for mail.
<t-ask>	Am I wrong, or did they improve installation a lot? Looks like it's just adding some repos and install it right away...
<t-ask>	While I'm out, because I'm using Arch :)
<Psi-Jack>	They definitely look to have improved the installation procedure, including native packages for various distros.
<Psi-Jack>	They definitely look to have improved the installation procedure, including native packages for various distros.
<Psi-Jack>	Blah
<Psi-Jack>	Arch doesn't make a good server.
<Psi-Jack>	Don't trouble yourself doing so.
<t-ask>	Why so?
<Psi-Jack>	It's rolling release.
<Psi-Jack>	Things WILL in fact, break.
<t-ask>	Good point
<Psi-Jack>	And if you don't maintain it at least once a week to /at most/ once every 2 weeks, more things will break harder.
<t-ask>	so using Debian is recommended
<Psi-Jack>	Well, I personally would recommend centos myself, but I hate Debian. :p
<t-ask>	Those are the little things Linux will ever provide distro wars, hehe :)
<Psi-Jack>	Well, I've hated Debian since the day it was born. :p
<Psi-Jack>	Cause I was there, when it tainted the internet by its birth. :p
<t-ask>	You just hit the wrong download button then ;)
<Psi-Jack>	Nah, Yggdrasil was waaaaaay better than most distros back then. :)
<kahtahs>	Psi-Jack: debian doesn't lack updates for a month like centos when rhel has a new point release
<ghostlines>	howdy is there a maximum amount of network namespaces a box can handle?
<Psi-Jack>	CentOS doesn't lack updates. In fact, point releases of CentOS do incorporate some new features, and a lot of backported patches.
<Psi-Jack>	ghostlines: Eh?
<ghostlines>	Psi-Jack I'm using smokeping with about 19 network namespaces and it's tanking. It's not graphing anything anymore
<Psi-Jack>	What's a "network namespace?"
<emperiz>	Psi-Jack: Did you experience that an update broke a working arch server?
<Psi-Jack>	emperiz: Many times.
<kahtahs>	Psi-Jack: untrue: http://wiki.centos.org/FAQ/General#head-cea9337e6513cc1567c4d05afbd693f1f7038ccb
<Psi-Jack>	Heck, I'd seen even more stupid issues, where the compiled kernel wasn't suitable for actual use. :p
<Psi-Jack>	kahtahs: And?
<ghostlines>	Psi-Jack it's like vlans
<kahtahs>	Psi-Jack: "The goal for release of a new point release or update set is four to eight weeks after the release by upstream." <- so 1-2 months without updates
<Psi-Jack>	UH huh.. And?
<kahtahs>	security updates..
<Psi-Jack>	I don't consider that so much of a bad thing at all. They do security updates much faster.
<Psi-Jack>	They prioritize that.
<jelly>	Psi-Jack: network namespaces https://lwn.net/Articles/580893/
<Psi-Jack>	Hmmm.
<Psi-Jack>	Interesting.
<kahtahs>	Psi-Jack: rhel doesn't provide security updates for older point releases. centos devs are only good at rebuilding.
<Psi-Jack>	Well, CentOS is owned by Red Hat Software now, so basically the same dang thing. :)
<kahtahs>	Psi-Jack: no, nothing changed in that regard. there's a firewall between rhel and centos
<Psi-Jack>	There is, yes, but it's much thinner than it was prior. :)

<leeyaa>	is it possible to throttle dd
<t-ask>	leeyaa: better tell what you want to achieve
<leeyaa>	t-ask: not to use all available io
<ntz>	pff. can anybody please remind me that rsyslog directive making him handling smart with repeated messages ? it is not exactly $RepeatedMessageReduction .. there's another module
<Psi-Jack>	leeyaa: ionice, at best.
<kahtahs>	Psi-Jack: i didn't see any speedup. oracle still is way faster than centos
<Psi-Jack>	leeyaa: Otherwise, no.
<leeyaa>	Psi-Jack: i think ive tried in the past with ionice and something went wrong
<leeyaa>	i guess ill have to try again
<leeyaa>	any better way to create empty files than dd ?
<Psi-Jack>	Well, dd itself has no throttling. ionice just prioritizes at the kernel level.
<Psi-Jack>	touch
<colo-work>	ionice will only work if your involved block devices have the cfq or bfq iosched attached
<jhodrien>	kahtahs: You not noticed the CR repo?
<Psi-Jack>	colo-work: True also.
<leeyaa>	Psi-Jack: i need 300gb empty file ;p
<kahtahs>	jhodrien: really? CR on production?
<Psi-Jack>	No you don't.
<Psi-Jack>	That's just silly! :p
<jhodrien>	Just because C6.7 takes a while to come out, doesn't mean RH6.7 security updates aren't available for C6.6 machines.
<leeyaa>	Psi-Jack: it is a disk volume, file based, for a xen domu
<Psi-Jack>	Uh huh. And? Thick provisioning like a mad man?
<t-ask>	leeyaa: https://grinux.wordpress.com/2012/09/07/use-nice-and-ionice-for-your-backups/
<kahtahs>	jhodrien: it does exactly mean that. CR is your own risk
<leeyaa>	Psi-Jack: yes
<Psi-Jack>	Using xen, like a mad man?
<jhodrien>	If we're being honest, all installs are at your own risk.
<Psi-Jack>	Why not just jump off a cliff while you're at it? :)
<jhodrien>	Just because it's CR, it doesn't mean it's terrible quality.
<leeyaa>	Psi-Jack: thats not the case here, i use what is available :D
<Psi-Jack>	leeyaa: There's many things much better that are also available. :p
<jhodrien>	Often it's issues with the ISO/installer that delay a point release, and they're doing no active work on the packages.
<leeyaa>	Psi-Jack: not here, i aint my decision, i explained to you many times already ;p
<jhodrien>	So why wait?
<leeyaa>	ha i could use rsync and copy existing file rofl

<leeyaa>	rascul: are they thick provisioned ?
<rascul>	actually it doesn't look like it
<leeyaa>	wont work for me then ;p
<leeyaa>	ill just create it on another machine and copy it later via network i guess
<rascul>	how is that better than using dd and /dev/zero?
<Psi-Jack>	It's not, really. :p
<peetaur2>	leeyaa: dd of=outfile.raw bs=1M count=0 seek=1000    instant 1GB sparse file
<leeyaa>	peetaur2: i dont need sparse file, thats the thing ;p
<peetaur2>	well then dd is still best, just no way to ever be instant
<leeyaa>	no need to be instant, just not overload server disks
<leeyaa>	i dont care if it runs or a week ;p
<peetaur2>	okay so just slow then?
<leeyaa>	yep
<peetaur2>	well you could use dd with a loop and do a bit at a time
<super_mrwu>	leeyaa: you can get use to cgroup
<leeyaa>	super_mrwu: no available on this server
<super_mrwu>	leeyaa: Linux 2.6.22?
<leeyaa>	peetaur2: it will still overload disks when creating that bit
<leeyaa>	super_mrwu: no server has no cgroups enabled
<leeyaa>	ill create it on a remote server
<leeyaa>	seems like best choice in this case
<peetaur2>	leeyaa: 10MB at a time won't hurt it much I think https://bpaste.net/show/217a84d618a1  I get 0.4  % util with this script
<super_mrwu>	leeyaa: it can be somehow difficult
<leeyaa>	peetaur2: thanks i will definitely try it
<JewFro297>	So, just updated arch linux, boot fails. I have terminal access but that's it. How can I see the log of the things that happen at boot? Something fails, but gets wiped off the screen before I see it
<peetaur2>	JewFro297: remove "splash=silent quiet" junk from boot config
<leeyaa>	thank you for the help
<leeyaa>	peetaur2: actually that works pretty well
<peetaur2>	good :)
<leeyaa>	it is even using some caching, these sata disks dont have speeds such as 10485760 bytes (10 MB) copied, 0.015978 s, 656 MB/s
<super_mrwu>	peetaur2: if we can get the disk IO throttle support without cgroup
<super_mrwu>	peetaur2: sleep doesn't seem to be a good solution.
<peetaur2>	super_mrwu: no sleep is a good solution... that's all a throttle is; if too much, sleep a bit more than usual, etc.
<peetaur2>	super_mrwu: and the "linux way" of things would indeed be not a cgroup thing, but just a command like    trickle --bwlimit=10MB/s othercommand
<peetaur2>	(trickle btw does exactly this, for network though, not local IO)
<JewFro297>	system.modules.load failed
<super_mrwu>	peetaur2: ...
<peetaur2>	for example a network switch throttle works like that... it has a limit, and then it just sets a time amount like 10 seconds, and if the limit is reached, it blocks 100% traffic until the next 10s block (eg. for broadcast throttle)
<super_mrwu>	peetaur2: ionice
<super_mrwu>	peetaur2: maybe this is a viable choice
<peetaur2>	ionice doesn't set B/s limits though... only priority
<super_mrwu>	yes
<leeyaa>	yeah ionice is not always good
<super_mrwu>	he does not want disk IO to be overload
<psayian>	Which cert would you rather get and why LPI-2/3 or rhcsa/rhce
<super_mrwu>	so i think ionice is viable
<super_mrwu>	leeyaa: you only don't want the disk to be overloadded right?
<peetaur2>	psayian: certs are not about knowledge or skill... they are about marketing.  You need the one your future employer has been made to believe is important; so check job postings or ask people in HR about what their clients are asking them to hire based on.
<peetaur2>	super_mrwu: you can set a process at the minimum with ionice and it will still slow other things down, even just by moving the drive heads, it will cause latency, even if the disk is only 10% busy already.
<psayian>	peetaur2: LPI is vendor neutral so what marketing is made there?
<peetaur2>	psayian: not sure... neutral may mean there is not enough propaganda going around for anyone to demand that one.
*	peetaur2 is a cynical optimist :)
<psayian>	peetaur2: How do you also validate that since I know the rhel ones are hands on you have to some sort of skill to get it accomplished.
<peetaur2>	psayian: I can't validate it... all I can say is the reason to choose one is more to do with the opinion of the HR department rather than a technical reason, so you should find out their subjective opinions rather than asking a bunch of computer nerds like here.
<peetaur2>	psayian: the best thing to put on your resume/cv is still real world work experience
*	super_mrwu does not appear to be a computer nerd.
<super_mrwu>	haha
<psayian>	I think I have my answer
<Psi-Jack>	Though LPI sucks for being half stupid and ignorant.
<peetaur2>	super_mrwu: don't worry... some day you will be counted among us
<kahtahs>	Psi-Jack: for example?
<Psi-Jack>	kahtahs: Last time I took the LPI Linux+ certification, I had to correct them on about 40~50% of their test.
<super_mrwu>	peetaur2: just kidding
<peetaur2>	sounds like Psi-Jack's score was between 50% and 60%
<Psi-Jack>	And the ignorant part came in when they refused to accept blatent proven facts for over 2 months of arguing with them. :)
<Psi-Jack>	peetaur2: Actually came out to be 100%. :)
<kahtahs>	Psi-Jack: can you be specific?
<peetaur2>	how is that possible if they are wrong on that much of it?
<Psi-Jack>	kahtahs: They had questions that either were not answerable with any level of accurate, or were flat out wrong. Simple as that. That was years ago.
<Psi-Jack>	Heh, people like me don't normally take such useless certifications. The only reason I was was because the Army. :)

<Psi-Jack>	zenguy_pc: Your apt-get is broken. What did you do?
<Psi-Jack>	And what distro?
<peetaur2>	zenguy_pc: download the .deb packages somehow (browser, or working apt plus /var/cache/apt/...) and then dpkg -i the files
<peetaur2>	zenguy_pc: try dpkg -l to see if dpkg is broken too
<zenguy_pc>	Psi-Jack:  pclinuxos.. rpm based but uses apt-get and rpm packages
<Psi-Jack>	EWWWWWWW!
<peetaur2>	and I think an undefined symbol is supposed to tell you a shared object name ... does it? it will help you figure out which package is broken

<Psi-Jack>	Yep.
<Psi-Jack>	PCLinuxOS == the problem.
<peetaur2>	zenguy_pc: if it uses rpm, then rpm -ql or something like that rather than dpkg commands, and rpm -i instead of dpkg -i
<zenguy_pc>	this is actually progress .. was messed up last night

<zenguy_pc>	http://pastie.org/private/b90skmeullfze7xhi9wiga

<peetaur2>	BluesKaj: it's not even just kmail... it tries to index all your documents and everything, even if you don't use kmail (and I have no idea what sort of query tool uses its index either :D ... I just use grep)
<peetaur2>	back when it was called nepomuk, you couldn't even disable it without it nagging you constantly, so I would just give it one empty dir to index and disable the rest, instead of disabling it; now you can unclick a box to disable it though
<BluesKaj>	yeah, just using kmail as an example of the dificulty, and baloo nepomuk is still diabled on my setup no matter how much betterit's supposed to be

<wondiws>	I often used to inadvertantly change the balance in alsamixer on an other computer, but now I'm trying to do that deliberately, but I can't :P
<echelon>	how do i delte these files.. http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=GmeeTD2X
<}>	echelon, easiest way is to match them with a glob and tab complete
<wondiws>	echelon, from command-line?
<echelon>	oh
<echelon>	wondiws: yeah
<}>	wondiws, you want to force mono in alsa?
<wondiws>	otherwise you can try mc, or a gui
<wondiws>	}, yes
<wondiws>	I forgot how I did that
<echelon>	i don't have mc on this box
<echelon>	and don't have root access
<}>	wondiws, would this work for you termbin.com/3xn0 ?
<}>	in .asoundrc
<wondiws>	}, I'd rather set it temporarely in alsamixer
<wondiws>	I know it's possible, altough it might be hardware-dependent, then it might not be possible
<echelon>	}: did it, thanks
<wondiws>	oh wait, pulseaudio has a balance feature
<wondiws>	whole stack of mixers the sound passes through :P
<echelon>	i did.. rm ./*QMK1* and rm ./*j*c5*
<spreeuw>	pussaudio --megapoettering
<triceratux>	http://www.osnews.com/ http://lxer.com/ http://www.oschina.net/news/ also phoronix sucks less if you read it with lynx ;)
<tjt263>	}: regarding the bash trick from earlier
<}>	tjt263, what exactly doesnt work?
<}>	"doesnt work" is very vague
<georgij>	Is there a way to run opengl applications from virtual-console? Like triggering X and when the gl-program closes terminate X with it.
<georgij>	?
<wondiws>	{ and I remember now, with 'Q' in alsamixer you can increase volume on left individually, and with 'W' for right
<echelon>	how do you fix the permission on /bin/chmod if someone were to remove the executable perms from it
<echelon>	without turning off the system
<georgij>	I know you can add to xinitrc : (1) app & -- when it closes x closes
<wondiws>	but I still hear on both ears
<georgij>	but what if you have multiple apps?
<echelon>	let's say someone were to chmod 444 /bin/chmod
<echelon>	how do you undo that
<echelon>	without powering off the system
<peetaur2>	echelon: tar xf, or the package manager
<}>	georgij, {app && ap2 && ap3} & # something like that
<}>	ah you need a ; there
<echelon>	tar xvf?
<echelon>	err
<fibre>	How can I combine curl + idn2 to easily request a domain with special characters?
<}>	georgij, { app ; app1 ; app 2; } &
<echelon>	peetaur2: compile it you mean?
<peetaur2>	echelon: could probably also cp another executable program, then cat chmod > otherprogram to replace content but not permission bits
<echelon>	peetaur2: ah, nice
<georgij>	}: Ah I believe I misexplained. I want to just etc. run doom with /bin/doom. That will instantly open X and run doom.
<peetaur2>	echelon: tar handles permissions... so extract the original chmod command out of a tar that has perms inside
<tjt263>	}: i didnt say that, im sure it does work, just not what i was looking for i will
<georgij>	}: Do I really have to link symlinks for each app?
<tjt263>	try to provide a better example
<echelon>	yeah, given you have the same binary
<peetaur2>	echelon: try one and find out :) will be fun (maybe make a copy of chmod to be safer)
<echelon>	kk
<}>	georgij, you said you want to run just doom, but earlier you said you want to run multiple binaries
<georgij>	}: yeah, perhaps I want to run doom or quake, and so on..
<peetaur2>	echelon: apparently there is lots on this online, including my cp and > answer (but they used dd) http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/83862/how-to-chmod-without-usr-bin-chmod
<echelon>	cool, thanks
<georgij>	}: perhaps I want to open up chromium or firefox
<georgij>	}: only one thing at a time though and once the application in question exits so does X11
<}>	georgij, ok, doesnt startx expect a client to run?
<georgij>	basically it should detect whenever I open an application that's depend on X to run
<}>	georgij, startx mything
<}>	and when it ends, X ends
<georgij>	}: is it as simple as that?
<}>	georgij, well it
<}>	's easy to try
<georgij>	}: Don't have X installed atm
<georgij>	}: thanks for your help though
<}>	georgij, I'll try it then, gimme a moment
<}>	need to reptyr irssi
<}>	test
<georgij>	}: Oh, you don't really have to go through the trouble, I guess you already did though hehe. Thanks a lot!
<georgij>	I just want this to test my OpenGL based projects and work without X. Will probably get a test-computer later on, to test everything through that.
<xcezzz>	so is opensuse zypper just garbage or am i missing out on how to use it properly
<Psi-Jack>	xcezzz: You're missing out on how to use it properly.
<tantalum>	xcezzz, zypper wasn't that bad when I used to useit
<peetaur2>	xcezzz: zypper is quite good
<Psi-Jack>	yum and zypper are comparable, but I prefer yum myself.
<tantalum>	xcezzz, what is the problem you are having?
<}>	georgij, ok
<Psi-Jack>	zypper has something yum doesn't, and yum has things zypper doesn't
<}>	georgij, it works but
<peetaur2>	heh I strongly prefer zypper... yum is down at the bottom with apt
<}>	georgij, the command must start with a dot or /
<xcezzz>	well im not a fan of any rpm based distro… mainly ubuntu/debian but i need opensuse 13.1 to build some win32-mingw stuff
<}>	georgij, see man xinit for an explanation
<peetaur2>	like "yum remove" requires network access :D wtf
<}>	georgij, so startx /bin/firefox works but not startx firefox
<xcezzz>	just installed opensuse 13.1 in a VM… fresh install nothing on it, zypper install something just sits at "Reading installed packages"
<peetaur2>	and the "yum remove" is a bug they have regressed on more than twice from what I found online
<xcezzz>	i cant search for packages… tried clean/update/refresh… rpmdb —rebuilddb… removed repos that referenced the cdrom used for install… just at a loss now. if it was deb i would have had it handled by now… just not familiar with rpm
<peetaur2>	xcezzz: zypper refresh -f; zypper search zypper     ?
<xcezzz>	yea, hangs at 'reading installed packages' on search cmd… goes to ~100% cpu… doesnt seem to be doing anything as used memory never changes…
<xcezzz>	i thought maybe it would take a while being only 2gb and 2x core VM… but overnight no progress
<georgij>	}: ah that doesn't matter at all!! Super thank you very much, I am so happy it was this easy!
<Schrostfutz>	I read that the opensource AMD driver has support for fancontrol, however I cannot find any resources on how to enable it. Do you know where I can find some?
*	autrilla_ is now known as autrilla
<ohcanada>	Schrostfutz: consult wherever you read that, and read any links from there
<MrPockets>	Word!
<Schrostfutz>	ohcanada: It was just a news entry without any additional details but I will try to find something
<tjt263>	}: ok so imagine i run an nmap scan or something of that nature where it outputs quite a bunch of different data and i use cut | cut a couple of times to clean up the text and isolate the wheat from the chaff, be it an ip address(es) or ports, services or whatever. i press enter and it comes out all nicely formatted in a string, exactly how i want it.                           "
<tjt263>	now i want to use that
<tjt263>	as an argument for another CLI program
<tjt263>	telnet or ssh for example
<ohcanada>	store it in a shell var like $MYIP or whatever
<ohcanada>	MYIP=$(somecommand | awk something | sort -u | cut whatever)
<ohcanada>	ssh "$MYIP"
<ohcanada>	or even do it in one, and miss out the var
<tjt263>	ohcanada: is that just like using alias
<tjt263>	right?
<ohcanada>	tjt263: not really. alias is carried out when you run the command, whereas vars can exist before during and after the command
<ohcanada>	tjt263: or to put it another way, an alias is just a textual shorthand for a command. whereas a var contains a value, obtained when it was assigned to.
<}>	fdfwkfr
<}>	weird bug, kmscon doesnt display on all screens, agetty does
<tjt263>	ohcanada: ok right so the $var is equal to the output of the command you give it,                            whereas alias is the command you give it
<}>	tjt263, no
<}>	tjt263, nothing is stopping you from doing alias thing="$(some commnd that returns output)"
<triceratux>	xcezzz: ive been running zypper on opensuse 13.1 for some time & have had no problems. id almost think its your vm. just dd the iso to flash & boot that way if all you need is a toolchain. also zypper is happier with a net connection available. be sure youre online
<georgij>	}: perhaps someone made an alias of the alias command then someone is really stopping him. :)
<tjt263>	}: i think thats in accord with what i said
*	hkr is now known as Guest80602
<cvillavicencio>	anyone here can help me with a really random issue?? (not related to linux :$) must be from usa
<cvillavicencio>	is just log in a web, with my user and pass :(
<cvillavicencio>	im not in usa and i need an access from there
<cvillavicencio>	and proxys don't work
<socomm>	Try find a VPN hosted out of the USA.
<cvillavicencio>	oh c'mon... :(
<cvillavicencio>	socomm i'd tried
<tjt263>	its like the alias represents an input command whereas a var represents the output of the command given to it, right?
<cvillavicencio>	can you help me? it's just login in spotify
<cvillavicencio>	i trust more in gnu users, 'cos that i come here to find somebody to help me :(
*	melonstorm is now known as illuminati
*	illuminati is now known as melonstorm
<socomm>	http://freevpnaccess.com/
<tjt263>	cvillavicencio: thats it, VPN or proxy
<cvillavicencio>	thnx
<}>	tjt263, no, var and alias behave the same way when it comes to assignment
<}>	tjt263, alias thing="echo" and thing="echo" are both equal to echo, you can type $thing in the terminal and it will run echo
<}>	tjt263, same for alias thing="$(command)" and thing="$(command)"
<cvillavicencio>	anyway, why anyone can just helpme and enter... :( i need an 1-minute access
<cvillavicencio>	well, i'll try with vpn, thx again
<Psi-Jack>	...
<Psi-Jack>	cvillavicencio: We're not here to help you circumvent stuff.
<}>	tjt263, the difference is that alias thing would evaluate the input when you run it, wheras $thing is treated as one "word"
<cvillavicencio>	i know, Psi-Jack... but, well... the freesoftware spirit, help the neighbor etc
<ohcanada>	tjt263: basic shell knowledge is absolutely *vital* to admin. you should be au fait with aliases, shell functions, substitution, redirection at the very, very least
<Psi-Jack>	cvillavicencio: Frack off.
<cvillavicencio>	windows morality ;-)
<tjt263>	}: oh okay thankyou that is a good explanation, i was actually just about to test them using echo like that!
<socomm>	I think someones try to social engineer themselves a victim.
<Psi-Jack>	!ops cvillavicencio Asking help to circumvent licensing.
<ohcanada>	tjt263: shell, awk, sed, grep, cut, find <--- things you will use daily
<cvillavicencio>	blah. bye
<}>	Psi-Jack, you scared him away!
<Psi-Jack>	I feel accomplished.
<tjt263>	cvillavicencio: ill help ya
<ohcanada>	no, you will not
<lpapp>	hi, what software would you recommend for changing the colors of certain lines on a powerpaint page. I would like to use it then as an image in my software.
<tjt263>	ohcanada: ?
<lpapp>	so the software must be able to import the images on the powerpoint page verbatim.
<socomm>	lpapp: libreoffice?
<tjt263>	ohcanada: awk and sed are two i dont have much experience with
<zerowaitstate>	tjt263: awk is for working with columnar data mostly; sed is for editing text, usually for regex-replace
<ohcanada>	tjt263: google "one liners" to get handy re-usable code snippets. but beware, all shell code and commands you copy&paste from other people are suspect, and should not be used without forethought on live production systems. as are all shell code and commands you type yourself ... :)
<tjt263>	zerowaitstate: cheers im sure i will end up checkin em out
<zerowaitstate>	tjt263: another thing is, you really, really have to watch out for bash quoting rules. There are characters that are special to bash, characters that are special to sed/awk, and characters which are special to regex. you gotta properly escape all of that
<zerowaitstate>	tjt263: that's why you gotta be careful copying and pasting code
<lpapp>	socomm: can krita be good for this?
<tjt263>	zerowaitstate: yeah thats actually sounds exactly like what im looking into, i dont see what you mean about copying and pasting though
<Dr-007>	hey there. i want 2 users to be able to modify a file. the users; friso and www-data . i should put them in the same group.. right? i now have this in my /etc/group: www-data:x:33:friso and i chowned the file as www-data:www-data . only when i am the user friso. i can not modify the file.
<socomm>	Dr-007: Is the file writable by the group?
<Dr-007>	-rw-r--r-- ;; i think not
<zerowaitstate>	Dr-007: chmod g+w filename
<socomm>	Dr-007: You'll need to set it to be group writable in order for the friso to be able to write to it.
<tjt263>	ohcanada: is this the type of think youre talking about? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/68372/what-is-your-single-most-favorite-command-line-trick-using-bash
<Dr-007>	zerowaitstate, socomm, thanks.
<Dr-007>	zerowaitstate, chmod g+w filename. g stands for group + write?
<Dr-007>	i always use chmod [number]
<ohcanada>	i wonder if the chmod man page explains that kind of stuff
<zerowaitstate>	Dr-007: chmod number sets all permission bits at once. the other form just changes particular bits
<}>	ohcanada, no way man, in order to find out you need to be an ascetic chinese monk living on a mountain for 60 years, eating only beans and rice
<Dr-007>	exactly
<tjt263>	Dr-007: yeah me too
<ohcanada>	tjt263: caveat lector in aeternum
<tjt263>	but i am a vegan mountain monk :)

<tjt263>	nah im actually not anymore

<ocZio>	thanks guys
<Penguin>	But maybe not because it has so many decimal places?  I don't know.
<ocZio>	restored! such a lovely community, better favourite this channel
<ocZio>	blind, unfortunately wasn't with vim so no .bak files :(
<ocZio>	it was ftp transfer.
<}>	Penguin, it just seems multiplying 4 is weird and cryptic, 2*arccos(0) seems more sense
<blind>	rough.
<ocZio>	(that was sarcasm for the fools there..)
<tjt263>	how many decimal places, Penguin  ;p
<ohcanada>	Penguin: it's the beauty of the journey, with all the sights and wonders, not the destination
<dearhawk>	ocZio: how do we know that your sarcasm-declaration wasn't sarcastic? Hence, the original statement indeed wasn't sarcastic at all?
<}>	oh look it has sin and cos
<ocZio>	dearhawk, look far far ahead, the whistle will tell you the truth.
<dearhawk>	ocZio: that makes me want to look at a wizard movie, something in the style of LOTR
<ocZio>	isn't that wonderful my dear?
<dearhawk>	if I start now, watching them all in a row, I'll be done tomorrow morning.
<dearhawk>	yes it is
<Penguin>	Remember to calculate for breaks to get food, drink, and relieve yourself.  No sense in calculating for sleep.
<tjt263>	wtf is sleep
<ocZio>	something, us, the mortals do tjt263
<dearhawk>	tjt263: it's that "blank" thing that happens when you pass out between coding and coding
<tjt263>	you guys are tryna trick me
<ocZio>	so? no ideas? is there at least a way to scan the whole drive while it is in use ?
<ocZio>	grep 'foo' /dev/sdaN ?
<ocZio>	without umount ?
<MetaNova>	data recovery should not be attempted in a running environment :/
<dearhawk>	candy, junk food, ice cream, lots of movies, no exercise and not taking responsibilities is a sign of depression I guess. I just need to do all those stuff till I'm happy, just to get on my feet again.
<MetaNova>	ocZio: there's extundelete but I'm not sure if it's of any use for overwritten files
<MetaNova>	ocZio: there's also TestDisk
<MonkehParade>	Uhm, hey guys.
<MetaNova>	MonkehParade: what's up?
<MonkehParade>	I'm going to undertake a task, a personal learning project, and was wondering if you guys could tell me if my idea is feasible?
<naptr>	i think i've used ddrescue in the past. it actually saved all the txt and images.
<ocZio>	MetaNova, will give it a shot. ty.
<naptr>	all video was badly damaged, though.
<MetaNova>	ocZio: and as usual, the Arch wiki on the matter has a good bit of detail about the subject
<MetaNova>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/File_recovery
<MetaNova>	should be worth reading
<ocZio>	deb user here, but appreciate the help thanks.
*	hkr is now known as Guest80017
<MetaNova>	ocZio: Arch wikis aren't exclusively for Arch
<MonkehParade>	Basically, it's just an app that monitors your wifi, and lets you know what devices are connected to it, and it also lets you block it. Kinda like "Who is on my wifi" on windows, but FOSS.
<triceratux>	study arch, recommend ubuntu, run slack, keep an eye on that wheel group ;)
<MetaNova>	their content extends to nearly all 'nixes
<ocZio>	"Note that it works only when the partition is unmounted."
<naptr>	triceratux++
<ocZio>	next :-)
<MonkehParade>	.. because I haven't really found any for linux and I'd like to contribute.
<TinFox>	Arch wiki is based around arch but more often than not is just generally useful
<Penguin>	One of the wonderful things about GNU/Linux distros is that there is a fundamental similarity between them all.

<xeon-enouf>	fluter: well, what's the issue? and.. well - unless you repackage your own .diff?
<xeon-enouf>	or, whatever you have there
<fluter>	xeon-enouf: I just want part of the diff, not the whole
<xeon-enouf>	fluter: the kernel README in src/ top dir, has a nice overview of using patch ;-)

<fluter>	thanks xedot
<fluter>	thanks xeon-enouf
<dusty`>	Hi
<dusty`>	With xfce I can set emblems on files in thunar, but if I use a window manager instead I can't
<dusty`>	How do you get emblems to work in a wm?
<xeon-enouf>	you mean icons?
<xeon-enouf>	file icons?
<pingfloyd>	I think he means little icons
<pith0n>	How would I be able to broadcast a still image (jpg), or my desktop on cam?
<dusty`>	it's little emblemds that attatch on to the icon
<pingfloyd>	like show if a symlink etc.
<dusty`>	I can make a screenshot if you like
<pingfloyd>	or when you see a little lock
<xeon-enouf>	no idea; but i think a lot of that is in /usr/share/apps/ or /appname
<pingfloyd>	I wonder if it requires some xfce related service
<dusty`>	that sounds like a good lead pingfloyd
<dusty`>	ill google a bit more with that in mind
<pingfloyd>	it probably comes down to some optional dependency of thunar
<xeon-enouf>	find /usr/share -name '*.icon'
<xeon-enouf>	i see lots of files with emblem in the name
<xeon-enouf>	dusty`: ^
<dusty`>	the special service might be gvfs
<xeon-enouf>	dusty`: you're likley just missing some pkgs; perhaps even gtk+/3 related
<dusty`>	ah
<xeon-enouf>	i have /usr/share/icons/ ... and some old gnome things
<pingfloyd>	"Thunar, since version 1.6, has started using the gvfs-metadata daemon to store metadata. The metadata is stored in ~/.local/share/gvfs-metadata"
<xeon-enouf>	isn't XFCE built on gtk+ ?
<pingfloyd>	http://askubuntu.com/questions/408743/how-do-i-set-emblems-in-thunar-without-the-gui
<diegoviola>	xeon-enouf: yes
<xeon-enouf>	ok
<[R]>	xeon-enouf: well it sure as hell ai'nt built on rock and roll
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: thanks
<dusty`>	interesting! So I need to figure out how to start the daemon i guess
<xeon-enouf>	[R]: shut your QT! :-p
<[R]>	xeon-enouf: HAHA
<[R]>	xeon-enouf: are you calling me a cutie?
<souuell>	shut your qt library!
<xeon-enouf>	[R]: ofcourse!
<pingfloyd>	you know if may just be the theme, have you tried switching icon themes?
<xeon-enouf>	apt-cache search gtk+ icon ...
<xeon-enouf>	meh.. or just
<xeon-enouf>	apt-cache search thunar icon
<zorak8>	im trying to put a static ip in a virtual linux im runnig, with the help of this tutorial http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-configure-a-static-ip-address-tutorial/
<zorak8>	but is not working, anyone can see the tutorial and said me if maybe the tutorial is wrong, or its me
<Remram>	are there really versions of tar in the wild which don't have --skip-old-files?
<Remram>	xeon-enouf: my irssi emails me highlights... sorry
<Remram>	(also, highlight window!)
<ramfjord>	hey guys, I'm not sure if I'm in the right place.  I'm using mac OS, and trying to attach an external hard drive.  It's not registering like normal when I look for it, but it does show up as /dev/disk2, /dev/disk2s1, and /dev/disk2s2
<ramfjord>	Is there a unix way to see why it won't mount?
<Remram>	well given that your problem doesn't involve Linux in any way, this is probably the wrong way
<Remram>	place*
<Remram>	but, there should be logs
<Remram>	"sudo dmesg"?
<xeon-enouf>	see #macosx
<Remram>	Cmd+Space console Enter
<xeon-enouf>	if you boot a linux livecd/usb, then come back
<ramfjord>	there is a simple error message, thanks guys!
<ramfjord>	I am a programmer, and I've used linux plenty of times before :p
<ramfjord>	ahh, I tried macos, and osx, but not macosx
<xeon-enouf>	well - the tools/utils are entirely different, not to mention the naming conventions for devices, etc etc etc
<xeon-enouf>	ramfjord: /msg alis list #*mac*os*x :-)
<xeon-enouf>	for freenode, alis is the chanserc lister/helper
<xeon-enouf>	chanserv
<Remram>	"alis"?
<Remram>	same command sent to chanserv says I don't have permission, weird
<Remram>	alis is like the nice chanserv
<Remram>	anyway, can I assume a non-OSX tar recognizes --skip-old-files?
<Remram>	OSX doesn't know this option but I don't really care
<xeon-enouf>	GNU tar? man tar, see gnu.org?
<Remram>	manpages don't have these helpful "since version X" annotations
<xeon-enouf>	don't see a skip-old in my old gnu tar manpage
<xeon-enouf>	yeah, mostly -- bash does though, IIRC
<xeon-enouf>	meh, not man bash .. somewhere though :-P
<Remram>	my OS X knows --keep-old-files but that's not helpful
<Remram>	my program literally starts a Linux VM if you run it on OSX
<xeon-enouf>	what is with OS X lately?
<Remram>	the only machines with tar I have are 2 debians 8 and one mac
<Remram>	so I can't tell if the option is widely spread or not
<xeon-enouf>	gnu tar has a --keep-old-files
<Remram>	and --skip-old-files
<annihilannic>	Well, it seems to be somewhere between versions 1.15.1 and 1.23
<xeon-enouf>	i know, just confirming the other
<xeon-enouf>	yeah, my tar is old
<Remram>	bsdtar has --keep-old-files, but not --skip-old-files
<xeon-enouf>	1.26
<Remram>	1.26! I don't know how you possibly got that info but thanks a lot
<annihilannic>	tar --version
<xeon-enouf>	it doesn't help you -- it's old, it
<xeon-enouf>	s GNU, and it doesn't have your wanted option
<sebboh>	Can I programmatically generate /etc/fstab based on the currently mounted filesytems?
<xeon-enouf>	annihilannic: so, you
<annihilannic>	xeon-enouf: that's strange 'cause 1.23 on RHEL6 does have the option... backport?
<xeon-enouf>	re saying it's a regression? removed?
<Remram>	oh wait, misread
<xeon-enouf>	annihilannic: which option?
<annihilannic>	--skip-old-files
<xeon-enouf>	can you pastebin your manpage? :-P
<Remram>	I'm gonna use Docker and find out
<Remram>	for once you're going to be useful, Docker don't let me down
<annihilannic>	pastebin blocked for me
<annihilannic>	working around it..
<Remram>	Ubuntu 12.04 has GNU tar 1.26, doesn't know --skip-old-files
<Remram>	Ubuntu 14.04 has GNU tar 1.27.1, it knows --skip-old-files
<Remram>	I'm screwed though, 12.04 is still supported
<annihilannic>	xeon-enouf: http://pastebin.com/KAn7bWaw
<xeon-enouf>	ok
<xeon-enouf>	your old centos must be patched, even though the tar version is a lesser one
<annihilannic>	I guess RH backported the feature
<xeon-enouf>	yea
<xeon-enouf>	or, it (the feature) didn't propagate over to the deb-based until later
<xeon-enouf>	annihilannic: cat /proc/version  ?
<xeon-enouf>	curious
<Remram>	Debian 6 squeeze has 1.23, no option
<xeon-enouf>	same version as annihilannic RHEL, but his has it
<annihilannic>	xeon-enouf: Linux version 2.6.32-431.3.1.el6.x86_64 (mockbuild@x86-003.build.bos.redhat.com) (gcc version 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-4) (GCC) ) #1 SMP Fri Dec 13 06:58:20 EST 2013
<Remram>	Debian 7 wheezy has 1.26, no option
<xeon-enouf>	annihilannic: ahh, thanks -- curious if it's somehow kernel related  - though doubtful -- maybe glibc though
<Remram>	so there we have it, I can't use it
<xeon-enouf>	yea 4.3.3 gcc here
<annihilannic>	I've never used the option anyway...
<xeon-enouf>	yea 4.3.3-15 even gcc here
<Remram>	I kind of need the option, there's no real way to emulate it
<annihilannic>	Extract to separate location, then mv -ri them to the destination or something?
<xeon-enouf>	annihilannic: grep -r skip-old-version /usr/share/doc/tar/
<xeon-enouf>	see if the Release notes mention it
<spillere>	how can I add the permission to an user to edit /var/www where user/group is www-data??
<xeon-enouf>	er
<xeon-enouf>	skip-old-files
<xeon-enouf>	or just a piece of that
<xeon-enouf>	i don't have anything here, since obviously my version (gcc) is too old
<toothe>	i keep removing dovecot and I see that the /etc/dovecot files are still ther....
<toothe>	there*
<toothe>	how do I get rid of them all?
<annihilannic>	xeon-enouf: no matches in /usr/share/doc
<Remram>	my VM breaks if I don't use --skip-old-files :(
<xeon-enouf>	use purge
<xeon-enouf>	annihilannic: ok, thanks
<toothe>	i have....
<toothe>	nvmd, I fixed it.
<xeon-enouf>	heh
<xeon-enouf>	just empty files now? :-P
<Remram>	annihilannic: cp or mv don't have a --skip-old-files either
<xeon-enouf>	Remram: he was offering a possible work around, not same option
<Remram>	oh wait, cp has --no-clobber
<Remram>	at least, my version has it
<pfred1>	I know this is kind of hard to see but has anyone seen glitchy video like this before? http://i.imgur.com/NPV71I7.jpg
<annihilannic>	Remram: They have a -i which prompts you if you want to replace files
<annihilannic>	Remram: if it's non-interactive then it won't overwrite
<pfred1>	it is in the right hand monitor on the bottom
<Remram>	really?
<Remram>	pfred1: yeah you see that when a screen area doesn't get written to at all
<Remram>	you see random stuff from previous buffers
<pfred1>	Remram it is something screwy with my driver I built a RT kernel and it only does it when I boot that
<Remram>	it's usually a software issue
<pfred1>	Remram oh it is definitely a software issue
<Remram>	it's weird to me that anyone would use an RT kernel
<Remram>	but no I have no idea why that would only happen on that
<pfred1>	I switched to the Nouveau video driver but for some strange reason I think the binary driver is being picked up when I install the kernel?
<pfred1>	Remram low latency audio
<Remram>	that's a reason
<Remram>	anyway, g'night
<xeon-enouf>	pfred1: grep drv /var/log/Xorg.0.log
<xeon-enouf>	pfred1: lsmod | grep -E 'nouveau|nvidia'

<xeon-enouf>	pfred1: if you came to nouveau from nvidia, reinstall all your libgl1-mesa-* pkgs
<pfred1>	xeon-enouf yeah I swapped them out already
<xeon-enouf>	nvidia/ati clobber libGL
<xeon-enouf>	maybe find #nouveau ?
<pfred1>	xeon-enouf the stock kernel works fine it is just the one i built
<xeon-enouf>	oh.. well, start comparing configs ; AND check your kernel cmdline
<pfred1>	yup been there already too
<xeon-enouf>	and even perhaps which modules grub is loading early on
<pfred1>	yeah I've diffed lsmod
<xeon-enouf>	and/or compare =y  vs.  =m
<pfred1>	yup
<xeon-enouf>	you might need a =y when you're using a =m
<pfred1>	I know I've already been through all of that
<xeon-enouf>	how about kernel versions?
<pfred1>	they're the same
<xeon-enouf>	how far apart?
<xeon-enouf>	uff
<pfred1>	cept one is RT patched
<pfred1>	this should work
<xeon-enouf>	well, see if you can toggle some of the PREEMPT settings on boot
<Froolap>	nvidea sould be forced to place a warning lable on their video cards.... WARNING: Large amount of grief included as a surprise bonus package.
<xeon-enouf>	pfred1: so, different cpu scheduler via default?
<pfred1>	Froolap Nvidia cards are fucking better than anything else on Linux
<xeon-enouf>	cfs?
<Froolap>	everybody has problems with them.
<xeon-enouf>	pfred1: one is RT patched, yes; but .. you also built it :-P
<xeon-enouf>	pfred1: try building a non-RT one :-)
<pfred1>	Froolap how about simplyfying that to just everybody has problems?
<pfred1>	xeon-enouf I've built loads of LInux kernels
<xeon-enouf>	ignore broad generalisations
<xeon-enouf>	pfred1: do it again :-P
<pfred1>	xeon-enouf I've already built this one twice
<xeon-enouf>	this time, use same source/version as the RT one
<xeon-enouf>	hrm
<xeon-enouf>	then use nvidia :-P
<xeon-enouf>	pfred1: glxinfo | grep -i direct?
<pfred1>	direct rendering: Yes
<Voyage>	Hi
<xeon-enouf>	ok
<Voyage>	sory
<pfred1>	I think it may be something debian is doing in postinstall
<xeon-enouf>	pfred1: can you do me a small favor? paste output of grep -E 'PREEMPT|HZ' /boot/config-$(uname -r) ...or /proc/config.gz
<xeon-enouf>	pfred1: aha, using an initrd with your RT?
<xeon-enouf>	did you debian-patch it?
<pfred1>	sure why not?
<pfred1>	not that i know of
<xeon-enouf>	debian has a -rt kernels, not using / tried them?
<pfred1>	I looked and didn't see one
<pfred1>	I run Wheezy
<Foxhoundz>	Does anyone know what sort of program/software the Voyager probes ran on?
<Foxhoundz>	if any?
<xeon-enouf>	apt-cache search linux-image
<xeon-enouf>	same here pfred1
<xeon-enouf>	even earlier
<pfred1>	yes i know how the package manager works thanks
<pfred1>	debian's stock kernels kinda suck balls anyways
<xeon-enouf>	/bin/sh: acs: command not found

<xeon-enouf>	see -rt- ?
<xeon-enouf>	686 though, heh
<pfred1>	yes i am more interested in getting this to work
<xeon-enouf>	well, that's my arch, not sure about amd64
<xeon-enouf>	nope
<pfred1>	I use 32 bit
<xeon-enouf>	notice what linux-source-* says about the patchset
<pfred1>	xeon-enouf I suppose i can look at their RT kernel source and see how it is differeht than the one i patched
<pfred1>	frigging PITA that I have to reconfigure another kernel though
<xeon-enouf>	yea ; so you pulled from kernel.org and use make deb-pkg?
<pfred1>	sure why not?
<xeon-enouf>	perhaps try compiling nouveau yourself?
<xeon-enouf>	pfred1: i do that too - just saying
<pfred1>	yes I've done it many times in the past
<xeon-enouf>	 to make an even comparison, to see what's different; otherwise you could git bisect
<pfred1>	it is supposed to work
<xeon-enouf>	file bug report :-)
<pfred1>	this is supposed to work too
<xeon-enouf>	i'm just pointing out all the possible different areas ; not being patronizing, nor judgemental
<pfred1>	I hear ya if it was easy I'd have figured it out hours ago
<xeon-enouf>	patches, versions, initrd/no-initrd, configs ; etc etc
<xeon-enouf>	i never said it was easy
<pfred1>	oh i know it isn't easy it shouldn't be quite this hard though
<xeon-enouf>	it's actually more difficult, IMHO
<pfred1>	bah I've setup RTAI systems from scratch before
<xeon-enouf>	pfred1: your Xorg version is exactly the same?
<pfred1>	sure I didn't touch it
<pfred1>	if i boot the non patched kernel it all works
<xeon-enouf>	i know for a fact, that possible dissimilarities between Xorg version and its _drv.so file versions
<xeon-enouf>	cause issues
<xeon-enouf>	well, ok -- initrd is different right?
<xeon-enouf>	try with working initrd
<pfred1>	I hope so
<xeon-enouf>	IOW, try with working initrd, and your RT kernel combo
<xeon-enouf>	should work decent - since versions are quite the same
<pfred1>	initrd goes with kernel version
<xeon-enouf>	no no no - pass grub the other one
<xeon-enouf>	in your initrd line
<pfred1>	seems kinda dumb
<pfred1>	I'm going to uninstall this kernel and see if I see the same dkms: removing: nvidia-current 340.65 (3.2.6801.rt-rt99) (i686) message again
<xeon-enouf>	heh, right - it's easy
<xeon-enouf>	also, you do have a RT System.map in your /boot now?
<pfred1>	because that doesn't seem right to me
<xeon-enouf>	kernel-mode-setting, IINM
<pfred1>	System.map-3.2.68.02.rt-rt99
<xeon-enouf>	ok
<xeon-enouf>	nvidia lingers
<xeon-enouf>	got stuff in /etc/modprobe.d/ ?
<pfred1>	yeah I thought I switched it all out
<xeon-enouf>	or /etc/modules even
<xeon-enouf>	perhaps it's rolled into the initrd even
<pfred1>	removing it is not a viable option I want to pursue either
<xeon-enouf>	klibc
<Voyage>	how to see what user is in what group?
<pfred1>	yeah it shouldn't be I blacklisted it
<xeon-enouf>	pfred1: wait, did you install/run the RT one, PRIOR to removing nvidia?
<pfred1>	I'll say this nouveau is worthless for accelerated GL
<xeon-enouf>	pfred1: run update-initramfs -k your-RT-kernel ... you might need to do something else prior - check /etc/initramfs-tools/
<pfred1>	xeon-enouf no
<pfred1>	I removed the binary driver before I installed the RT kernel
<xeon-enouf>	ok - i'm out of idea
<xeon-enouf>	be good
<pfred1>	I'
<pfred1>	I've even rebuilt the while kernel without the nvidia driver installed
<pfred1>	whole kernel even
<pfred1>	because i went back to tweak a few config things
<xeon-enouf>	but lastly, check how/the grub GFX settings / etc linux16 or whatever it does
<xeon-enouf>	stupid modular binary
<xeon-enouf>	and lastly /etc/default/*  especially /grub* in there
<xeon-enouf>	grub-mkconfig -o  (update-grub2 will usually run that / symlink)
<pfred1>	xeon-enouf there's a file in /etc/default called nvidia-kernel but all it says is NVIDIA_CARDS=1
<xeon-enouf>	you tweaked it  right into breakage :-P
<xeon-enouf>	ouch
<xeon-enouf>	comment that out
<pfred1>	I can't imagine how that would muff things up
<xeon-enouf>	and check init.d/ scripts
<pfred1>	well I do want to go back to the binary driver
<xeon-enouf>	the init.d/ scripts look in /etc/default/ for very early boot
<xeon-enouf>	for global parameters
<pfred1>	because the open source driver is worthless
<xeon-enouf>	ok
<Voyage>	I just created an amazon ec2 which requires me to login to ssh via a key.pem. that I am able to but now I want to add new users but not share the key. What I did was, created a new user and gave him password. Tried to login by ssh again but now it says  "Permission denied (publickey)." why so?
<pfred1>	I tried ot play GL Doom with it and it was painful
<xeon-enouf>	rgrep /etc/default /etc/rc*.d/
<[R]>	Voyage: your sshd is configured to not accept passwords
<Voyage>	[R],  really? my local ubuntu openssh accepts passwords
<[R]>	Voyage: sounds like your ubuntu openssh is configured differently
<Voyage>	[R],  ok. how can I be sure and then change it?
<[R]>	sshd configuration is in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
<Voyage>	k
<pfred1>	OK I have to reboot this glitchy video is making my eyes go buggy over here
<Voyage>	[R],  it says PermitRootLogin without-password          StrictModes yes
<[R]>	ok...?
<[R]>	thats all it says?
<Voyage>	says a lot but thtas what I think is relevant
<Voyage>	this too RSAAuthentication yes
<Voyage>	PubkeyAuthentication yes
<[R]>	don't think
<[R]>	know
<[R]>	there's a man page for a reason
<[R]>	theres also a billion web pages that explain it
<Voyage>	man for what?
<Voyage>	hm ok
<[R]>	the config...
<Voyage>	[R],  there are man pages for configs too? I though only for commands
<Voyage>	[R],  I just checked it out. the config of my local ssh is same.
<Voyage>	[R],  I will try to find the reason. thanks for the help
<[R]>	if it allows passwords, its not
<xeon-enouf>	Voyage: why don't you create a new key for your new user?
<xeon-enouf>	and login via keys only
<Voyage>	xeon-enouf,  hm.. I can, will have to find out the procedure, 2)wanted to know how to login by password  (just to learn functinality of ssh)
<xeon-enouf>	well, ...
<xeon-enouf>	add a -v or two, or three for ssh verbosity during login attempts
<xeon-enouf>	then, if successful, close it, otherwise you'll get spammed with debug msgs :-P
<xeon-enouf>	(logout, then login without the -vvv)
<xeon-enouf>	i recall helping someone, and they left it like that, and were perplexed they were getting spammed once logged in :-P
<diegoviola>	how do you guys manage your ssh-agent?
<diegoviola>	it's a pain to do it manually
<diegoviola>	eval $(ssh-agent)
<diegoviola>	every time
<diegoviola>	I want to do it one time and forget
<xeon-enouf>	hrm, does printenv | grep AGENT show it in your env?
<diegoviola>	if I run eval $(ssh-agent) yes
<xeon-enouf>	well, no, without running it :-P
<xeon-enouf>	make ssh-agent launch on boot ; or run the daemon initrd script
<diegoviola>	but then when I close the terminal I have to export SSH_AUTH_SOCK, etc
<diegoviola>	hrm
<xeon-enouf>	isn't it also tied to dbus? perhaps your missing one of the 3 typical dbus launch command
<xeon-enouf>	1 is system-wide; 2 are user-specific, IIRC
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: when you fully bootup, you should have a /tmp/ssh-*/agent. something, and /tmp/dbus* too perhaps; netstat -i  #will show unix sockets
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	I am using fedora, I have an ediff (emacs ) session, how do I toggle between the ediff frame and the buffers frame?
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	Alt-tag doesn't work, it goes between different applications but not the same o ne.
<proprietarysucks>	what kind of development time would it take with 5 full time programmers to develop a new clustered filesystem which does not layer on top of another file system? ballpark.. like 3-5 years?
<xeon-enouf>	1 minute, it's called beowulf :-p
<icarus>	does anyone have any experience with openvpn AS? (access server)
<icarus>	is it a better solution than going through the stock install of openvpn?
<diegoviola>	xeon-enouf: thanks
<proprietarysucks>	I'm talking about a clustered filesystem, for example OneFS
<bullgard4>	xeon-enouf: [Debian-8] I downloaded from http://chatzilla.rdmsoft.com/xulrunner/ the tarball »ChatZilla 0.9.91 (Linux i686)«. It is now in my ~/Downloads/ directory . http://chatzilla.rdmsoft.com/xulrunner/: "Installation: Simply extract a tarball and run chatzilla." What is the "proper" directory to extract this tarball in? (I know that I can choose any directory. But which one is to be...
<bullgard4>	...preferred?)
<diegoviola>	xeon-enouf: you're right, when I start X I already have a ssh-agent running
<diegoviola>	xeon-enouf: but I still need to export SSH_AUTH_SOCK manually and point it to the right /tmp/ssh-*/agent* socket
<diegoviola>	and ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
<diegoviola>	I'm hoping not to have to repeat that every time
<kerframil>	bullgard4: a sub-directory of /opt would be conventional
<hay207>	hello guys , i want to enable cpu frequency, and my cpu is: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4510U CPU @ 2.00GHz , so which module i choose from here : http://www.pantz.org/software/cpufreq/usingcpufreqonlinux.html ?
<bullgard4>	kerframil: Excellent! - Thank you very much for your advice and help.
<proprietarysucks>	can someone explain to me what pnfs is for? after reading the docs I don't really get what benefit it is giving
<DLange>	hay207: intel_pstate
<kerframil>	hay207: I wouldn't bother with that guide. things have changed; de Ven's comments here explain why: https://plus.google.com/+TheodoreTso/posts/2vEekAsG2QT
<kerframil>	hay207: you're probably already using the pstate driver
<kerframil>	hay207: "Today (well, last 5 years), the frequency in idle is zero, and even the voltage is now zero (NHM and later).... so what frequency the OS picks during the idle period is completely irrelevant."
<kerframil>	hay207: by "NHM", he's referring to the Nehalem microarchitecture and above
<Voyage>	what will these 2 commands do?  sudo find /var/www/html -type d -exec chmod g=rwxs "{}" \;
<Voyage>	sudo find /var/www/html -type f -exec chmod g=rws  "{}" \;
<kerframil>	Voyage: set read/write/executable/setuid bits for directories. ditto for files, except for the executable bit.
<kerframil>	setting the bits for the assigned group, in both cases
<Thomas777>	Hi guys, question, does anyone here uses Nagios, if yes: is there a way to make check_logfiles show more line when it finds something?
*	sins-_i is now known as sins-
<Voyage>	kerframil,  ok, whats the difference between the first and the second command?
<kerframil>	Voyage: ", except for the executable bit"
<Voyage>	oh. why do it "x" in another command. why not just use one?
<Voyage>	kerframil, ^
<kerframil>	Voyage: because the intention is to set the x bit for directories and *not* the files
<kerframil>	Voyage: setting x on a directory allows for it to be traversed
<Voyage>	kerframil,  i see, why would the dirs be x? I wonder. traversed?
<Voyage>	kerframil,  traversed as by "ls"?
<kerframil>	Voyage: if the x bit is not set for the group, any member of the group who isn't the owner will not be able to descend beneath the directory, which is just a little counter-productive.
<kerframil>	Voyage: unless the x bit is set for everyone
<hay207>	ok guys, can i add ondemand governer to my available governers
<Voyage>	kerframil,  oh so it will not be able to "ls"?
<kerframil>	Voyage: bottom line: directories should have +x
<kerframil>	Voyage: if you want to see the effects, I'd suggest you experiment with a test directory
<Voyage>	kerframil,  ok.
<Voyage>	kerframil,  whats different with just find /path/to/directory -type d -exec chmod g+s '{}' \;
<kerframil>	Voyage: it will sweep directories and enable the setuid bit for the each directory's group
<Voyage>	so, same thing?
<kerframil>	same thing as what?
<Voyage>	as the first 2 commands. (guess not as I found those 3 in different tutorials)
<kerframil>	clearly, it's not the same
<Voyage>	hm ok
<Voyage>	thanks!
<Voyage>	I will read more docs
<kerframil>	g+s sets that bit and leaves all the others alone
<kerframil>	=rwxs means to enable those bits and only those bits (unsetting any other bits if necessary to achieve that). you might want to check the man page.
<kerframil>	also, setgid has a special meaning for directories. (I should have said "setgid", not "setuid" before) ... https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/Directory-Setuid-and-Setgid.html
<kerframil>	it's very useful when you have users that are members of a common group (but not necesarily their primary group) that need to manage files within a common directory
<kerframil>	+s on directories will cause the assigned group to be inherited by newly created files/directories beneaht
<nrem>	kerframil: oh, thanks. you reminded me i needed to set that
<kerframil>	in this case, web developers (presumably)
<veek>	can you change wheezy to stable

<nrem>	veek: yes?
<nrem>	https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/release-notes/ch-upgrading.html
<veek>	ah thanks
<nrem>	odds are you'll be fine just changing it and update && dist-upgrade, but safe bet is to follow that
<AtlasTX>	is emacs the preferred editor for coding C in Linux? Context: I'm taking a C course next semester and I'm looking to become proficient in an editor that is commonly used with c development
<AtlasTX>	I know vi but as I understand emacs offers more functionality that would be useful in C development
<Froolap>	I've never used either
<proprietarysucks>	I use vim for everything but I only program in bash and python
<kerframil>	Voyage: https://bpaste.net/raw/f15d1a1953ab
<Froolap>	I hate looking through 259,000 jpg just to see if any of them might be interesting.
<Voyage>	what does the three sections mean -rw-rw-r--        the left most is for user who owns the file,  middle is for user who owns files, right most is for everyone ?
<DeadCrow>	AtlasTX: In the end it will come down to personal preference.
<DeadCrow>	Voyage: user, group, world
*	kopfkind_ is now known as kopfkind
<Voyage>	am ok
<Voyage>	DeadCrow,  I wonder WHY everyone can read a file that I created......
<Voyage>	  I wonder WHY everyone can read a file that I created......-rw-rw-r--  1 developer developer-group        5 May  5 06:36 abc
<bigsky>	hi all
<naptr>	Voyage: it has world read permission.
*	Olipro_ is now known as Guest87507
<Voyage>	naptr,  well, ya but why. I just used nano. if this is default behaviour of linux to give world wide read persmissions to any file that is creatd by any user; its bad. no?
<naptr>	Voyage: you can, of course, set the default file permissions on new files...
<naptr>	not sure why that would be your default. what distro is it?
<Voyage>	ubuntu
<naptr>	so, if you go to your terminal and issue "touch xyz"
<naptr>	can you tell me the permissions of file xyz please?
<MetaNova>	Voyage: default file permissions on creation have to do with umask
<naptr>	there is umask, dmask, and fmask.
<MetaNova>	I was just about do admit I'm not an expert about it, and you proved my point naptr
<MetaNova>	I was not aware dmask and fmask existed
<naptr>	actualy, each file system mount has its own list of which are available.
<MetaNova>	s/do/to/
<kerframil>	Voyage: the default permissions depend on the behaviour of the application and/or your umask
<kerframil>	dmask/fmask is completely irrelevant for filesystems supporting posix permissions. it's used to fake them for filesystems that do not.
<lng>	Hi! How to disable Intel graphics on Dell Latitude E5550?
<naptr>	MetaNova: it's usually a result of the options included with a mount, but, kerframil makes the best point about umask and the behavior of the app.
<naptr>	true, dmask and fmask are not actual.
<kerframil>	the mount options won't have anything to do with it, if it's ext4, xfs or any stock Linux filesystem
<naptr>	well, what's default in ubuntu?
<naptr>	probably what he's using.
<kerframil>	ext3 or ext4, I would imagine
<MetaNova>	afaik it's ext4
<kerframil>	no distro is going to default to something that isn't posix. it wouldn't work.
<naptr>	no, seriously, there are a lot of ext4 now
<naptr>	i wonder if ubuntu would set world read for new files; it sounds like something they thought would make life easier for their users.
<kerframil>	naptr: it's set by pam_umask
<finlandia>	ext4 seems to be the most common default, exceptions for some distros running XFS/btrfs
<kerframil>	naptr: it could also be set with the umask command upon login but it doesn't do so by default. there's a commented example in .profile
<naptr>	kerframil: that's a good one to know.
<naptr>	could set that in a user home and make it non-writable to him or her.
<naptr>	too bad! you're using less.
<naptr>	i thought umask had something also to do with what rights you had on all files and directories. that must have been something else.
<naptr>	the one given as =022
<kerframil>	you use chmod to change permissions on existing files. umask affects the permissions of newly created files.
<kerframil>	naptr: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask
<kerframil>	the final '2' in 022 masks out the world-write bit
<hay207>	So guys, can i control cpu frequency of pstate intel module? ,  cause i have a GUI program that fails to control
<kerframil>	in other words, the resulting mode is the requested mode after a logical AND against the umask
<kerframil>	hay207: no
<kerframil>	naptr: here you go: printf "%.4o\n" "$(( 0666 & ~0002 ))"
<hay207>	ok
<kerframil>	naptr: note how 666 gets reduced to 664
<kerframil>	same with 0022, for that matter
<kerframil>	well, it would reduce to 644. you can use the above to test the effects.
*	hex20dec1 is now known as hexy
<bigsky>	what is environment variable?
<bigsky>	xx=xxvalue
<bigsky>	is this xx kind of environmnet variable?
<hexy>	bigsky: It's variables the system uses
<bigsky>	is xx kind of environment variable?
<hexy>	s/it's/They're
<bigsky>	hexy: pardon
<hexy>	bigsky: You can make your own
<bigsky>	hexy: after xx=xxvalue , should i export xx ?
<kerframil>	bigsky: only if you have a need for the variable to propagate to the environment of any subsequently executed programs
<i5um41ru>	I can't log into my Debian, stuck in "enter run level";
<kerframil>	bigsky: var="foo"; perl -e 'print "$ENV{var}\n"' <-- prints nothing because var isn't exported and visible to the program executed (perl)
<hexy>	bigsky: You use export to store that variable as an environment variable for future use, like kerframil said
<bigsky>	kerframil: so if i need this variable when running make, i should export it?
<kerframil>	bigsky: yes. or use some other mechanism to feed it in (like a parameter).
<bigsky>	kerframil: how to feed make with parameter?
<bigsky>	make xx=xxvalue ?
<kerframil>	bigsky: I'm not a make expert, but this should work: xx=xxvalue make ...
<kerframil>	bigsky: that's one way of avoiding exporting
<Voyage>	naptr,  -rw-rw-r--  1 developer developer-group        0 May  5 07:43 newfile
<kerframil>	bigsky: in that case, xx will be set to the given value in the environment of make
<kerframil>	bigsky: whereas the current environment will not be affected
<kerframil>	# var="foo"; var=bar perl -e 'print "$ENV{var}\n"'; echo "$var"
<kerframil>	bar
<kerframil>	foo
<hexy>	Is it possible to create a symlink FROM fat32 TO ext3/4
<hexy>	?
<sauvin>	Have you tried it?
<hexy>	I know the other way is not possible
<hexy>	Yeah
<hexy>	I have
<hexy>	But I get too many symlinks error
<hexy>	Which doesn't seem like a related issue
<colo-work>	fat doesn't support symlinks, period
<DoverMo>	fat is wobbly
<colo-work>	you cannot store a symlink on a volume formatted with/as fat, be it 12, 16, 32, or ex
<hexy>	colo-work: Not trying to create the symlink on fat though
<hexy>	Fat is the source and ext is the dest
<hexy>	Does that make any difference?
<colo-work>	if the filesystem hosting the symlink can store symlinks, that should work
<kerframil>	hexy: fat is the target, you mean
<colo-work>	it's just a pathname, a string of bytes, after all
<kerframil>	hexy: in which case, it should work fine
<proprietarysucks>	I'm trying to find open files by pid on linux but lsof doesn't show them
<proprietarysucks>	I tried with vim and I am able to find the file, the swp file. however testing with 3 other apps I can't find the actual open files
<colo-work>	proprietarysucks, you know the PID of a process and want to know which fd's it has open? `ls -l /proc/<PID>/fd`
<hexy>	Here's the situation: On my android.. I am trying to create a symlink from /storage/emulated/legacy/linkFile.txt to /data/data/<appName>/originalFile.txt When I do that, it returns fine without any errors but when I go to check the symlink, it says that too many symlinks
<bigsky>	why if test code in makefile must be in one line?
<sv2241>	what's the next Ubuntu LTS after 14.04?
<hexy>	Now... When I try a hard link, I get an error saying cross device failed something
<storge>	debian users: i'm tracking jessie, but i also added stretch repos just to keep an eye on things. my /etc/apt/preferences has jessie pinned at 900 with stretch pinned at 500. at apt-get upgrade, i'm prompted to install gcc from stretch, and i think it shouldn't be prompting me with that pinning. any ideas?
<proprietarysucks>	it doesn't show the file
<spreeuw>	hexy: android is a hell
<cuqa>	any idea why the following cronjob does not work if installed in crontab? */5 * * * * ntpdate ntp.server.tld

<spreeuw>	all kinds of nested and chrooted stuff
<storge>	(when i did this same setup with jessie (900) and wheezy (500) it never tried to install wheezy apps; i just tracked the repo and could apt-cache it. i don't know why behavior has changed.
<spreeuw>	forget using it like a normal system

<DoverMo>	sv2241, lemme check
<bigsky>	it's really strange, why test code in makefile must be squashed in one line?
<DoverMo>	sv2241, 14.10 unicorn thing, 15.04 vivid vervet
<rtb>	how do i ensure that i have extracted archives up to plain text levels? i m dealing with some archives that have passed thru multiple levels of gzipping .. i was doing a zcat file | wc -l on them and coming up with wrong counts
<bigsky>	hexy: confused on how to write shell code in makefile
<bigsky>	hexy: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/764908/syntax-error-end-of-file-unexpected-expecting-fi read this
<bigsky>	kerframil: do you write shell code in makefile?
<kerframil>	bigsky: no. I'd expect it to work if the newlines are backslashed.
<sv2241>	DoverMo: 14.04 is LTS so 14.10 cannot be
<sv2241>	according to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ubuntu_releases, 16.04 will be the next LTS, due in April 2016
<DoverMo>	sv2241, 15.04 gets skipped?

<hexy>	bigsky: http://www.cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor/
<kerframil>	bigsky: it might not be related but the example in that post has a syntax error. in sh, it shouldn't be "[ expression]", there should be a space before the closing bracket
<sv2241>	@DoverMo: i think so
<sv2241>	DoverMo: Ubuntu 15.04 will be supported for 9 months for Ubuntu Desktop, Ubuntu Server, Ubuntu Core, Kubuntu, Ubuntu Kylin along with all other flavours. source: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VividVervet/ReleaseNotes
<sv2241>	that's strange
<EdwardIII>	hrm ok so the server is setup with publickey only. i've got one of the guys here to convert his key in filezilla to the dumb passwordless one. but filezilla is asying "no supported auth methods: server sent : publickey"
<kerframil>	bigsky: I'd fix that before doing anything else
<EdwardIII>	filezilla looks like it's trying to use the pemfile it made
<rosco>	I'm a bit lost with cgroup. I am supposed to create a mount point (like /cgroup/cpu) but isn't cgroup supposed to be already mounted in /sys/fs/cgoup?
<Bear10>	Has anyone here used ubuntu or linux mint on an ultrawide monitor 29"?
<Froolap>	why do you ask?
<Bear10>	Froolap: a friend of mine bought an ultrawide 1.5 years ago and said it didn't play nicely with ubuntu. now I'm looking to buy one myself for work and i use linux mint
<Bear10>	he said it might be resolved by now, but want to double check before i do
<peetaur2>	rtb: the file command (maybe with -i for easier parsing) will tell you the type
*	ChanServ gives channel operator status to sauvin
*	sauvin sets ban on *!*dl@staticline-31-183-68-153.toya.net.pl$##fix_your_connection
*	ChanServ removes channel operator status from sauvin
<rtb>	peetaur2, many thanks.
<Froolap>	bear I seriously doubt that it's a problem with the monitor, I would suspect it's a problem with the video card.
<Bear10>	Froolap: well it works fine when he boots into windows
<Bear10>	that's the thing he suspects a ubuntu driver or that ubuntu doesn't support such a resolution
<Froolap>	that dosn'rt mean that the drivers are working the same way.
<Bear10>	for example right now i've found http://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/877 which allows you to add custom resolutions?
<Froolap>	apples and oranges.  there are video card drivers, there are not monitor drivers.... just because linux drivers exist for a video card does not mean that those drivers propperly support every mode that the video card is capable of.  The monitor will only display what is sent to it.
<Bear10>	right, so the question becomes if i buy the monitor will i be able to display it
<Froolap>	you can only select resolutions that your hardware supports unless you want to destroy your hardware by trying to maske it do something that it is not capable of doing.
<Bear10>	ill google my video card
<Froolap>	Not a question about the monitor the question is do you have a video card that is capable of sending a signal that the monitor supports and do the linux drivers for that video card support that resolution?
<MetaNova>	Froolap: monitor drivers exist, but as we're talking about linux .. no, there are no monitor drivers
<Bear10>	the monitor is 2560x1080 i have a nvidia geforce 820m and i need to ensure that it works before purchasing
<Bear10>	but as far as i can tell i cant find a max resolution for the video card
<Bear10>	aha found it
<Bear10>	Max Resolution : 2560x1600
<Bear10>	should be fine then
<Froolap>	then i suspect that you'll have difficulty in getting things to work.  nvidea tends to be a problem.  open source drivers vs propritary drivers....
<MetaNova>	just install the nvidia binaries and get on with life..
<Froolap>	which works fine until something has a dependency that changes the drivers
<MetaNova>	Froolap: explain how that works, exactly, because I've never experienced such a situation
<storge>	back in the day nvidia was the hardware you wanted and ati drivers were the suck. funny how it seems to have reversed over time.
<Froolap>	I haave,   someone decided that kvirc requires qt widgets and that somehow decides that the video driver needs to be updated and the next time you boot the video is hosed.
<MetaNova>	that sounds more like an issue of not reading what you confirm to install
<Bear10>	MetaNova: well i'll let you know when it arrives if it works well :P
<Bear10>	thanks for the input
<Froolap>	I see a lot of people having problems with nvidea drivers, so it's not just me.  I won't have problems with nvidea again as I refuse to ever own another one.
<DF3D2>	Froolap, well nvidia has better linux drivers than amd
<peetaur2>	Froolap: good plan :D
<peetaur2>	Froolap: do you use open or proprietary ones?
<peetaur2>	I tested proprietary ones a few times... nvidia one butchered X, and uninstall failed, and even a full restore of a backup of /etc and my home didn't fix it (wtf)
<DeadCrow>	Nvidia, fuck you --Linus Torvalds
<EdwardIII>	hrm i bzip'd auth.log but a bunch of services are holding onto the file handle (rsyslogd, rs:main, etc)
<EdwardIII>	can i ping them to make them release & re-open the file
<EdwardIII>	should i send HUP?
<peetaur2>	if they support HUP, that is the correct thing to do (you can assume rsyslogd supports it)
<peetaur2>	why did you bzip them manually instead of using logrotate?
<peetaur2>	in logrotate.d you add your config, and include a postrotate command such as "killall -HUP rsyslogd"
<peetaur2>	config it to compress, rotate, etc
<stangeland>	hi there. I have a list of files in /home/myuser/mydir Those files were copied into /usr/bin  Is there some easy command i can use to removed the files in /usr/bin that are also present in /home/myuser/mydir ?
<EdwardIII>	peetaur2: i had a lot of recent stuff in there - i just wanted to clear it down and try another round of testing
<EdwardIII>	HUP seemed to do the trick, thanks
<bigsky>	Makfefile..
<storge>	#debian is quite an uptight channel.
<EdwardIII>	hrm weirdly i'm having issues doing pubkey auth. i tried switching loglevel to DEBUG3 but when i try and connect the auth.log just shows "May  5 09:00:31 ip-172-31-22-22 sshd[28709]: Connection closed by 92.27.22.22 [preauth]"
<go|dfish>	stangeland: for f in /usr/bin/*; do name=${f##*/} path=/home/myuser/mydir/$name; if [[ -e $path ]]; then echo rm "$path"; fi; done
<go|dfish>	strainwrld: scratch that, read your question the wrong way around.
<go|dfish>	stangeland: for f in /usr/bin/*; do name=${f##*/} path=/home/myuser/mydir/$name; if [[ -e $path ]]; then echo rm "$f"; fi; done
<go|dfish>	stangeland: if that output looks okay to you, you can remove the 'echo'
<peetaur2>	EdwardIII: I had that problem on a redhat 6.6 and is still unresolved; I'd be interested in hearing the solution. (I tried disabling selinux, checked permissions on / /home /home/user /home/user/.ssh and /home/user/.ssh/*, and didn't check if the account is locked since auth.log should say that; and checked /etc/security/access* where there was a blank config)
<EdwardIII>	hrm
<EdwardIII>	well this is ubuntu 14.02
<peetaur2>	same exact message... just "connection closed" without the basic sane reason of WHY it was closed (and by whose authority.. pam maybe?)
<peetaur2>	I suspected it was debian based since they call it auth.log (others call it secure, or dump it in syslog/messages)
<EdwardIII>	peetaur2: i was getting issues with some private key not existing, so i just ran ssh-keygen -A and that resolved the error
<stangeland>	go|dfish: i did not do anything
<go|dfish>	stangeland: well if it produced nothing, then nothing from /usr/bin/ exists in /home/myuser/mydir/
<peetaur2>	EdwardIII: do you have GSSAPIAuthentication = Yes? my redhat 6.6 had that
<Fyxi>	Hello, I have problem with configuring vsftpd ;c It's stop at listing directories.
<Fyxi>	Enabled ports at iptables and livebox, changed mode to passive, ran script that set IP for passive mode, still nothing.
<rexwin_>	what is crontab equiavlent to run a shell script every five minutes
<Fyxi>	I'm tired ;-;
<peetaur2>	rexwin_: figure it out yourself and ask us if it's right
<rexwin_>	*/10 * * * * /firstbat/nse-with-prev.sh
<peetaur2>	man 5 crontab
<rexwin_>	is this correct for every 10 minutes
<rexwin_>	?
<peetaur2>	yes
<peetaur2>	expect spam in your mail unless you also add  >/some/logfile.log 2>&1
<phoxis>	in the latest iostat 10.x the default output says kB_read/s  but in older ones it is phoxis Blk_read/s
<phoxis>	is there any way I can get blocks block read per sec in the newer version
<proprietarysucks>	ah I see now, lsof says it can't find open files via nfs
<proprietarysucks>	locking anyway
<phoxis>	I think rsec/s in -x will be appropriate as it says that from linux 2.4 block and sector reads are equivalent
<proprietarysucks>	I'm surprised there doesn't seem to be a way to show open files which are over nfs in linux from the client(?)
<rexwin_>	I am running watch -n 300 -d2 somescript.sh does this mean the script will be executed every 5 minutes and difference displayed
<rexwin_>	or will somescript.sh running continuously and displaying difference every 300 seconds
<proprietarysucks>	the first one
<lng>	How to figure out BusID for graphic card?
<peetaur2>	lng: lspci -nn ? lspci -tvnn ?

<lng>	peetaur2: tnx
<rexwin_>	how to comment out a crontab job to avoid running it
<peetaur2>	rexwin_: with #
<rexwin_>	I did that. thank you
<alteregoa>	are there any drawbacks if flow control is enabled?
<EdwardIII>	peetaur2: i have that off at the moment. did switching it on/off have an affect for you? fixing it/breaking it?
<peetaur2>	EdwardIII: it wasn't my server and I don't think they would want me turning it off
<Fyxi>	Any help for vsftpd problem?
<future28>	Pardon my ignorance, but how does vim know when and how to syntax highlight?
<DoverMo>	believe
<future28>	I open a file (I generated) that takes the form of another file I have. I open my generated file in vim and it's not highlighted, but the other original file is..
<Bear10>	future28: i think the first line usually tells it the filetype
<Bear10>	with a # comment
<future28>	Bear10: There's nothing of the sort here..
<Bear10>	how about the extension
<future28>	Bear10: Both the same, .pat
<Bear10>	is the same user opening the same file?
<Bear10>	maybe it's user prefs
<future28>	Yep, same user
<future28>	Same directory
<future28>	I just wrote one of the files myself and the other was given to me
<Bear10>	same file permissions?
<Bear10>	and ownership etc
<peetaur2>	Fyxi: first advice is to use sftp instead. :)
<future28>	Bear10: Yep, all the same
<peetaur2>	Fyxi: second advice is ask a real question
<Bear10>	future28: now you've got me, all out of ideas
<Fyxi>	I dont know what to ask, why svftpd is not responsing to my client pc?
<future28>	Thanks for trying Bear10 :)
<Fyxi>	Filezilla stops at listening directories
<Fyxi>	and error
<peetaur2>	Fyxi: okay, check that it is listening (lsof -Pni | grep LISTEN), and check the firewall (iptables -nvL, or less /var/log/firewall or equivalent; be aware some firewalls are retarded and have no logging at all, designed for max pain)
<peetaur2>	oh it connects then fails later? then it's probably some nat-traversal problem (one of the biggest reasons to dump ftp and use sftp/scp/rsync)
<future28>	Bear10: I copy the first 5 lines (metadata info lines) and the syntax begins to be highlighted upon reponening
<future28>	Still no idea why
<peetaur2>	what kind of firewall is it? modern things have nf_contrack_ftp which spies on the traffic to auto-open the ports that ftp stupidly expects to be traversible
<Bear10>	future28: right the metadata info lines are the # lines right?
<Bear10>	future28: mind pastebining ?
<future28>	Bear10: No, It's just plaintext
<future28>	Sure, I can paste the first few lines of each
<future28>	Bear10: I suspect there's a unicode char somewhere
<peetaur2>	Fyxi: some ftp server (includes vsftpd) have config to allow static passive ports that you can manually open on the firewall to fix that for passive mode, and some ftp servers (does NOT include vsftpd) actually use those features and it works
<lng>	umask is 0022, but new file is created with -rw-r----- permissions. Why?
<Fyxi>	I used passive mode & opened ports at router and firewall.
<lng>	parent dir has drwxrwxrwx
<future28>	Bear10: Far out, nevermind. I had a dislexia moment, so sorry. It was supposed to say ABBD and I said ABDD
<peetaur2>	(every version of vsftpd I tried configuring that way doesn't use the passive ports you set; for example I have   pasv_enable=Yes, pasv_max_port=52100, pasv_min_port=52199, but it just opens any random port instead)
<Bear10>	future28: :)
<Bear10>	glad you figured it out
<future28>	Thanks again, rubber duck debugging almost
<Fyxi>	Ah, so it can open random port that I didn't set, understood.
<peetaur2>	Fyxi: but what kind of router? a Linux one will work with nf_conntrack_ftp, but a random consumer grade PoS might not have that feature
<Fyxi>	This is probably the problem...
<Fyxi>	livebox
<peetaur2>	yes, it opens more ports in addition to 21 that you opened already
<peetaur2>	it was designed in 1970, before NAT was a normal thing to do, so it is totally broken; use sftp :D
<Fyxi>	i set min to 60000 max to 65000 and opened it at firewall & router
<Fyxi>	ok, i will see sftp instead... i am not masochist
<peetaur2>	okay well then use tcpdump -Avv port 21 to spy on the traffic to see which ports it opens; in my experience, vsftp never obeys the config for passive ports
<Fyxi>	do you know any sftp android client?
<haba713>	hi! is there any possibility to see nfs client statistics for a single process in kernel version 2.6.16? according to http://linux.die.net/man/1/iotop it is possible only since 2.6.20.
<rosco>	Fyxi: finding a good SFTP client IS masochism
<peetaur2>	the "sftp" command is bad, but the others are fine; and gui ones just act like any ftp client
<sarthor>	Hi, I there is any free open source web based software that can pull data from time attendance (Finger Print Devices)? Please guide me if some friend knows about this. Thanks.
<rosco>	none of the do mirroring, except lftp.
<farciarz84>	how can I check if the file is encrypted by openssl ?
<farciarz84>	is it possible?
<peetaur2>	farciarz84: the file command might tell you
<peetaur2>	the start of the encrypted output has some header info, so it is probably possible
<farciarz84>	hmm tricky...
<Fr3DBr>	Anyone have any clue of why a VPN Server, woulnd't work with mschap-v2 authentication ? It does connect, authenticate and then it gets disconnected with a : LCP terminated by peer ("M-3^DM-j^@<M-Mt^@^@^@^@) error just after it :(
<ayecee>	Fr3DBr: what's the rest of the debug output?
<Fr3DBr>	ayecee http://pastebin.centos.org/27086/
<ayecee>	can you enable debug to get the details of the negotiation? not sure if it'll help, but it'll give more detail about what's being negotiated.
<ayecee>	in pppd
<Fr3DBr>	ayecee I tried to do it, enabling debug and dump, but I didn't get the negotiation output, do you know how I should do it ?
<ayecee>	how did you do it?
<Fr3DBr>	ayecee adding debug and dump words to options.pptpd
<ayecee>	usually it's a matter of putting "debug" in the pppd config file that the vpn server is using.
<ayecee>	the log in the pastebin, where did that come from? perhaps it's not logging debug-level messages.
<Fr3DBr>	ayecee /var/log/messages
<ayecee>	might have to adjust syslog configuration to see those messages. i don't know how offhand.
<Fr3DBr>	ayecee this is what happens with debug and dump enabled :
<Fr3DBr>	ayecee http://pastebin.centos.org/27091/
<angevin>	hello, /proc/asound/cards list two sound cards for my system but pulseaudio only detects one and it is the wrong one. What should I do ?
<angevin>	I want pulseaudio to use the other card
<ayecee>	Fr3DBr: huh. the line is "debug debug" ?
<Fr3DBr>	[ayecee]: no, it is only debug
<ayecee>	Fr3DBr: anyhow, i don't have any particular ideas here.
<Fr3DBr>	[ayecee]: hehe ok

<Fr3DBr>	ayecee yeah, it required changes in rsyslog
<Fr3DBr>	ayecee I'll show you the full stuff now.
<eirirs>	from rsyslog to ssyslog?
<Fr3DBr>	ayecee http://pastebin.centos.org/27096/
<ayecee>	looking
<Fr3DBr>	ayecee from what I see, it is not receiving an IP maybe.
<ayecee>	looks that way, pppd isn't sending an ip to the client.
<Fr3DBr>	ayecee wasn't radiusd supposedly responsible to do this ?
<ayecee>	i wouldn't think so. radiusd would just be for authentication, wouldn't it?
<Fr3DBr>	ayecee but you can define the ip pool there, in its settings :o
<ayecee>	*shrug*
<ayecee>	pppd doesn't seem to be aware of that :)
<Fr3DBr>	ayecee yeah
<sv2241>	I'm experiencing a weird issue when trying to access an Amazon EC2 instance.

<peetaur2>	on server (auth.log)
<sv2241>	no, checking
<sv2241>	most of the professional software I need/use is built only for windows platforms hence I don't have the luxury of trashing my Windows license away... not yet at least. I would say that this holds true for many other industries as well

<foofoobar>	Hi. So I have a program which depends on credentials passed via ENV. I now want to run this program via cron (and still pass this credentials via ENV), what is a good way to do this?
<peetaur2>	sv2241: you can also use openssh on windows, in cygwin for example

<freeroute>	hi, is it possible to add a visual cue when first character of a shell prompt is a space? Reason I need this is because I have ignoreboth in $HISTCONTROL, so if my command start with a space then they don't get written to history. So I was wondering if it was possible to change the color of the prompt if I would press space before I would write a command and return to normal if I deleted that space.
<peetaur2>	future28: yes; oh and my script was a bit wrong (it would only save changed lines)
<future28>	peetaur2: Yeah I see that, I need to extend it to have extra conditions, how do I do that? Thanks again
<peetaur2>	future28: awk -F, '$4 == "1" {$4 = "....."}; {print $0}' oldfile > newfile
<peetaur2>	future28: for the more complicated condition, probably your if(...) {
<peetaur2>	syntax would be better
<g0ts1ck>	anyone ?
<peetaur2>	g0ts1ck: is the file also accessible via HTTP under a different path? if not, you have to make that possible, then make the symlink relative I guess
<peetaur2>	g0ts1ck: I probably never had to symlink files on http, only dirs which is easier using an alias directive (in apache,.. haven't tried it in lighttpd)
<peetaur2>	and there's probably a channel for lighttpd
<Fr3DBr>	ayecee it is fixed :] thanks for the hand. it was just a configuration issue with ippool in radiusd
<future28>	peetaur2: Thanks, worked a treat
<BluesKaj>	Hiyas all
<stangeland>	hi...i have a set of usb-entries in my machine....is it possible to see in linux if these are usb2 or usb3 ports?
<peetaur2>	stangeland: lsusb -t   the "xhci" ones are usb3
<stangeland>	peetaur2: so just 1 usb3 plug? http://paste.ubuntu.com/10989467/
<mad_moses>	hi, how can I exit a frozen ssh connection? Normally I am closing my terminal and reconnect but there must be a way to quit ssh right?
<peetaur2>	stangeland: maybe a bus with many ports
<peetaur2>	mad_moses: enter, ~, .
<stangeland>	peetaur2: i see.... so then i somehow need to figure out what port is what?
<BluesKaj>	mad_moses, type exit

<mad_moses>	peetaur2: thx
<g0ts1ck>	ok found out what was the problem

<Trefex>	hi, i have a problem. ona new CentOS 7 install
<Trefex>	i get a broken pipe after like 2 mins, and then the host identification changed
<Trefex>	this is more or less occurring all the time
<Trefex>	how could i go about debugging this problem?
<shadok>	farciarz84: if there is no visible header and file returns "data" you could try compressing it, an encrypted file shouldn't compress as it's random
<peetaur2>	Trefex: ssh-keygen -R "$host"; ssh-keygen -R "$ip"   and try again and see if it happens again
<Trefex>	peetaur2: if i do that, then after 2 mins, broken pipe, and again it changed
<shadok>	farciarz84: but without knowing the encryption parameters you'll have a hard time decrypting it anyways
<peetaur2>	farciarz84: and as I said before, you can look at the header... there is some non-encrypted stuff, like see how mine says "Salted"? https://bpaste.net/show/bc56e70b11a8
<farciarz84>	peetaur2: mine has no header ( although salted ) -> it startswith U2FsdGVkX19EQPGShEFt1jBm806UVPkoYSJKm
<jelly>	farciarz84: base64 decode that for fun
<farciarz84>	what I need is to run openssl, provide a filepath as an arg, maybe the alg used for encryption and it should tell me -> file is encrypted.
<jelly>	farciarz84: if you base64-decode it, you may realize it looks the same as what peetaur2 has
<shadok>	farciarz84: listen to jelly first
<farciarz84>	jelly: : Salted__D@?Am? bla bla
<farciarz84>	:0
<farciarz84>	Yep I am listening
<jelly>	that's all I had to say :-)
<peetaur2>	jelly: hah oh nice
<farciarz84>	ok nice nice, is it constant?
<peetaur2>	not entirely constant apparently... mine wasn't base64 (openssl enc -k <(dd if=/dev/urandom bs=512 count=1) -aes-256-cbc -salt -in <(dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M 2>/dev/null) -out outfile)
<farciarz84>	I mean reproducible
<grublet>	rot13 -> morse -> encrypt -> print on paper -> lock in a safe -> throw safe in the ocean
<grublet>	there i solved infosec
<peetaur2>	you forgot, replace air gaps in safe with molten lead
<farciarz84>	peetaur2: -a
<grublet>	peetaur2: we will inject it with nitrogen like chip makers do to make you think there's more chips than there are
<grublet>	thats like top level encryption there
<farciarz84>	jelly: thx, looks that it works and is reproducible, hurray....
<Trefex>	thanks for the help. turned out there another VM with the same IP on the network
<Trefex>	so there was indeed a "MIM" :D
<nrem>	just so y'all know, ssh CA's are the best things ever.
<awkwardtechdude>	I've been asking around for an answer to this. So I'm the only person of my friends and family to use Linux(OS), and they all use skype. As you probably know, Microsoft provides a crappy client for Linux. Also, I'd like to not use proprietary software. My question is, what protocol should I use and how should I message my friends?
<ananke>	awkwardtechdude: the only one compatible with skype is skype.
<awkwardtechdude>	protocol
<awkwardtechdude>	I don't want skype
<ananke>	awkwardtechdude: there's no alternative.
<jpentland>	Is it possible to check a bz2 file to see if it has any corruptions?
<Pumpkin-_>	you should use the crappy skype client because dealing with that will be much easier than making your friends and family all change how they do things.
<ananke>	awkwardtechdude: sounds like you're in the minority, considering everybody else you communicate with uses skype
<awkwardtechdude>	yeah
<freeroute>	Pumpkin-_: depends on the interface and performance of the alternative
<awkwardtechdude>	i can try to disable its notifications  and use it in pidgin over d-bus for a little better of an interface
<ananke>	freeroute: you seem to think there's an alternative. this isn't a technical issue as much as convenience
<awkwardtechdude>	anyway, I have school, gtg
<nbt>	jpentland: bzip2 -t file (-t = test compressed file integrity)
<ananke>	'i want everybody else around me to adjust to my wants'
<jpentland>	nbt, will it also work for .tar.bz2?
<freeroute>	ananke: currently there is none which is not in heavy development, no.
<nbt>	jpentland: not sure if tar has a test option, I can't see one in the help
<jpentland>	nbt, hmm ok thanks
<Penguin>	nbt: it does
<bruxC>	hi, I'd like to move all mkvs located in a subfolder up a folder... I'm at a loss on how to construct this. I've tried mv /*/*.mkv . but it says no match, however if I put in place /folder/*.mkv . then it will work on the inidivual folder.
<bruxC>	What parameter do I use in order to specify all subfolders?
<bruxC>	i'm dumb. it's **/*.mkv
<bruxC>	Yay google.
<Penguin>	Folders are graphical.
<bruxC>	I'm not sure what that means.
<Penguin>	It means file systems have directories.
<WildPikachu>	Penguin, you know what he means, please stop it
<bruxC>	Aw, I see. He's being facetious.
<DLange>	he's being Penguin
<bruxC>	Whatever the case, I figured it out. Sorry to have wasted precious comment space.
<DLange>	no worries, we've become a little bored here 'cause nobody asked a question for 20mins or so
<DLange>	so thanks for testing that the channel is still alive
<bruxC>	My pleasure. I can't wait until I'm proficient at *nix.
<bruxC>	It's so fun yet so frustrating.
<DLange>	with great power comes great responsibility. Everybody can move files with a mouse. It's much faster with the shell. Also much faster to shoot yourself in the foot.
<triceratux>	plus noones dumb. in a cli youre always interacting with a syntax interpreter which you never are on doze
<shadok>	triceratux: that's not the case anymore since powershell by the way
<triceratux>	indeed. & ive never been able to manage files with a mouse. i always format up a shell script with hundreds of explicit renames like im still running msdos 2.11

<doomlord>	anyone heard of a window-manager which can automatically switch windows based on activity of content.. ( a monitoring mode)
<doomlord>	even for textmode (eg somethign like gnuscreen)
<doomlord>	eg: imagine having a tonne of windows open, and they automatically sort themselves to show 'the most active'
<daze>	how would it decide, though? you should set some algorithms to define what 'activity' means
<daze>	usually WMs don't care about the content inside windows
<doomlord>	frequency of content changing, you'd have to set some threshold to avoid flicking too fast
<shadok>	doomlord: kde could switch windows like that in 3.x but i suppose it's limited to qt apps
<doomlord>	each window could be given a score which decays over time; any change to the windows content increments the score;  settings: decay factor, and switching threshold perhaps.. tweak for effect
<doomlord>	really I'm after IRC channels viewed this way , but I wondered if a general solution existed
<doomlord>	i'd just like to have a tonne of IRC channels open to one side..

<nVee>	hi guys, i was busy installing cpanel on my server when ssh closed unexpectately. I presume the installation is still going on in the background and I have since reconnected
<nVee>	is there a way for me to return or view the output of the previous installation process?
<pbbunny0801>	hi!
<DLange>	nVee: the ssh session will die with a timeout after some time (often 10 mins). That long you /may/ be able to use reptyr on the shell in the defunct ssh session. But I'd consider just installing cpanel again. Can't be that much work.
<nVee>	DLange: thank you, and yes no work at all, just worried that it may time out again

<fxmulder_>	why does `free` show a much different number for -/+ buffers/cache used than /proc/meminfo shows for buffers and cache?
<fxmulder_>	free shows 19204620 and /proc/meminfo shows 13456876 for cached and 18704 for buffers
<MrElendig>	because there is a bit more that goes into it

<foofoobar>	I want to run a program via cron. The program needs some credentials which it reads by environment. How do I make this env variables also available when it is run via cron?
<MrElendig>	sounds like a really bad design in that program
<MrElendig>	and how to pass env vars depends on the cron implementation
<jhodrien>	Why not just run a wrapper via cron?
<rascul>	wrap it!
<Psi-Jack>	Twice!
<Psi-Jack>	Just to be sure. :)
<annihilannic>	  fxmulder: The free output is a result of a calculation, used - (buffers+cache), and free + (buffers+cache)
<annihilannic>	fxmulder_: it's a stupid way to display I've always thought
<foofoobar>	MrElendig: Why a bad design decision to pass credentials via ENV?
<foofoobar>	jhodrien, rascul: With ‚wrapper‘ you mean something like http://hastebin.com/ewecizirad.bash ?
<rascul>	sure, then call that from crontab

<ohcanada>	Amun_Ra: yes i hear you. i played with zfs for a while, and it went as smoothly as a swiss watch, but it Ate My Ram. i might well use zfs in future tho, when i have say 128GB ram ... :)
<triceratux>	ob-sed: munchen is having issues. but yes theres new poster children :) http://www.zdnet.com/article/after-a-10-year-linux-migration-munich-considers-switching-back-to-windows-and-office/
<Amun_Ra>	ohcanada: as it will be backup backup server, I decided to set-up that box classicaly, mdadm→luks→ext4
<Psi-Jack>	Hmmm.. Fun... Docker does definitely add some issues when trying to test chef stuff. Specifically anything that depends on more low-level things, like /proc/acpi/event, the old deprecated method. heh
<ohcanada>	Amun_Ra: Safety First is always a good plan
<ocZio>	hi, running ntpd, is it possible to set it up in a way that it syncs the time to the hardware clock as well ? (rather than me manually doing hwclock --systohc)
<Psi-Jack>	ocZio: hwclock is for when you don't use NTP.
<ocZio>	Psi-Jack, not really, my environment has flaky internet connection and the computer is constantly restarted. I have hardware clock and I force it to system at the boot of the machine, at the same time when I get a chance to have internet access and there is a successfull update from ntpd I would like to update the hardware clock.
<Psi-Jack>	Sounds like you have other more important issues to be fixing.
<ocZio>	Psi-Jack, that is pretty important.
<Psi-Jack>	At boot, you could do, ntpd -qg & hwclock --systohc.
<Psi-Jack>	With ntp updating adjtime, that should resolve most of your issues.
<rascul>	chrony might be better than just ntp
<Psi-Jack>	But, you have obviously way more important issues to fix. Like your flaky internet connection, and computer constantly being restarted.
<ocZio>	Psi-Jack, the internet connection being flaky/not available doesn't work well with 'on boot get time from internet and quit immediately (-q flag))
<ocZio>	Psi-Jack, this is an embedded device.
*	kopfkind is now known as kopfkind_
<Psi-Jack>	Yes, hence, FIX YOUR OTHER MORE IMPORTANT PROBLEMS. :)
<ocZio>	there is not OTHER problem.
<Psi-Jack>	...
<Psi-Jack>	Good luck.
<ocZio>	Psi-Jack as I said, this is an embedded device. You cannot guarantee a safe shutdown.
<jeffreylevesque>	does `dmesg` display information regarding all current active kernels?
<Psi-Jack>	If only you had been less vague and said that from the start.
<thomas_d>	would anybody care to translate this command into explicity dummy-human-english form please: sed 's/www/www\/wordpress/g' default > wordpress
<thomas_d>	i.e. "do this and send this to that" or something
<ocZio>	if only you assume that you know everything :-)
<ohcanada>	jeffreylevesque: "current active kernels"?
<Psi-Jack>	I do know everything.
<eeelvis>	thomas_d: it will replace `www` with `www/wordpress`
<ocZio>	sure you do, congrats on you
<ohcanada>	jeffreylevesque: you can only have one kernel at once, unless they changed it ...
<eeelvis>	thomas_d: from the file `default`, and then write it to the file `wordpress`
<jeffreylevesque>	so, when i print `dmesg`, what is it?
<jeffreylevesque>	a list of current processes?
<thomas_d>	eeelvis: aha, thank you very much :D so "go through the 'default' file, replacing www with www/wordpress and then make that a diff doc called wordpress" ... nice, cheers
<eeelvis>	jeffreylevesque: Not a list of current processes, at least.
<eeelvis>	thomas_d: welcome :)
<ohcanada>	jeffreylevesque: it is the kernel ring buffer. informative messages from the kernel, usually
<jeffreylevesque>	of processes that have run, will run, or both?
<ohcanada>	jeffreylevesque: please go away
<jeffreylevesque>	ok
<jeffreylevesque>	whoops, i'm back :)
<thomas_d>	eeelvis: and that leaves the default document untouched?
<thomas_d>	without the "> wordpress" it would go ahead and change everything in the "default" file wouldn't it?

<balloonface>	what is the expected timeline for nftables to be production quality? Just looking for a rough guess.
<bls>	about as long as it takes for someone to start a new packet filtering project to replace it
<ohcanada>	balloonface: when a major distro devotes some time to it, add one year - is as close as i'd like to stick my neck out
<ohcanada>	prolly spring 2017, at the earliest
<bls>	i.e. once it's accepted into a LTS release
<eeelvis>	thomas_d: I am actually not sure about that... It might change the original file, but it might also only output it in the stdout (standard output) (terminal)
<balloonface>	ohcanada: do you know if any distro has communicated an interest in it?
<ohcanada>	balloonface: i have not heard any such thing
<balloonface>	alright, I'm guessing that if it's not even in Fedora yet, it'll probably be a bit before it hits RHEL anyways. Who knows what the future holds, though.
<toothe>	i noticed that mint uses a lot of canonical's repositories
<Psi-Jack>	toothe: Well, d'uh..
<Psi-Jack>	Linux Mint is basically Ubuntu with some modification. :p
<toothe>	right...but you'd think they'd have their own repos by now
<toothe>	OR, canonical would cut them off
<pclover>	how about just use Debian :)
<ohcanada>	that would alienate a potential revenue stream, and mark won't be doing that any time soon
<toothe>	pclover: that takes too much work.
<jarlopez>	Any tips for debugging X? All my TTYs are displaying fine, but after running startx the screen becomes black for ~5sec, displays for a split second, and returns to black
<pclover>	toothe, too much work for debian?
<toothe>	yes
<ayecee>	jarlopez: start with the logs
<ohcanada>	jarlopez: have a look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log right at the end
<pclover>	why?
<pclover>	toothe, why is it too much work?
<toothe>	pclover: Because there are so many repos that are lacking.
<toothe>	and I find it frustrating.
<pclover>	lacking what just curious
<rumpel>	lacking perfection
<jarlopez>	ayecee, ohcanada: I'm tailing it right now, there are no messages corresponding to the repeating black behavior
<toothe>	well, I haven't tried it in a bit...but I jus tremember that I had to keep trying to install stuff that didn't exist in the repositories that I guess I just came to expect as part of modern linux distros. This was a while ago...
<rumpel>	lacking transcendence :>
<toothe>	pclover: Are your experiences different?
<toothe>	pclover: If so, more power to you. To me, all Linuxes are the same damn thing :-)
<toothe>	I'm still waiting for the Kernel to fork.
<ohcanada>	jarlopez: are you saying there are no messages like "0017.MGQ Switching to Inscrutible Black Screen"? how very odd
<pclover>	they are not
<pclover>	Linux distros are far apart and different and each one typically has it's own goal.
<pclover>	goals rather
<jarlopez>	I get a series of 'Suspeding/Resuming AIGLX clients for/after VT switch' and 'switch to mode 1920x1080...' when swithing between TTYs, but no inscrutible black screens
<pclover>	toothe, I use debian and centos
<jarlopez>	ohcanada: Above comment meant for you
<toothe>	pclover: maybe its just my experiences, but to me every Linux is every other Linux, just with different customization.
<rumpel>	toothe, like cars
<rascul>	differences in distros is generally trivial imo
<toothe>	no, i woudln't go that far.
<toothe>	rascul: Exactly....
<rascul>	deb vs rpm doesn't even mean anything to me
<toothe>	I think they're important for competition and sharing and trying new ideas.
<toothe>	rascul: exactly. And THAT is a bit ridiculous.
<toothe>	rascul: I can appreciate, say, trying out new things and seeing what works and what doesn't work.
<rascul>	just a means to an end
<rascul>	in most cases, i don't even run a full distro anymore
<toothe>	whether I gotta do apt-get install blah-dev or yum install blah-devel, it doesn't matter to me.
<rascul>	small, single app, immutable image
<speedio>	how do i write a Makefile that will be able to compile the whole program first including the shared libraries, and then when i do make install it will copy the shared libs to /usr/lib and bin file to /usr/bin? i dont understand how to compile the program if the libraries arent in /usr/lib (since make install hasnt been run yet) when doing that?
<rascul>	i have web sites running in 20MB images with 32MB ram
<ohcanada>	jarlopez: you might be better off going back to windows matey. it seems the rarified linux atmosphere is too much for your tender constitution
<bls>	which is why I find it humorous when people rave about a specific package manager, like it's such a huge improvement over <package manager they don't like>
<rascul>	for example
<balloonface>	ohcanada: according to netfilter it's in OpenSuSE and RHEL 7 as a tech preview so apparently it is incoming
<balloonface>	in case you were curious
<bls>	speedio: you may want to talk to #workingset
<speedio>	bls: thanks
<jarlopez>	ohcanada: That was unnecessary. I take it you've run out of useful advice?
<ayecee>	ohcanada: wtf
<ohcanada>	balloonface: interesting. i did look at something briefly, but i thought it was just another one of those airware moments (tm)
<triceratux>	toothe: the emphasis so far has been on licensing rather than on the bandwidth http://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=60&t=152450 canonical positively support mint as a means of increasing its visibility

<ohcanada>	jarlopez: well see, the problem is this. you were suggested to look at the Xorg log for clues. and you said there were none. you have not said what graphices card, which distro, which driver or anything. so short of telepathy, i fear we are at an impasse
<keypusher>	such condescension
<ayecee>	ohcanada: it would have been reasonable to mention that instead of jumping to theatrics.
<bls>	keestu: gcc -I/include1 -I/include2
<keestu>	bls thanks. ;)
<thomas_d>	for this command "chown -R www-data.www-data /var/www/wordpress" why is it www-data.www-data when the username is simply www-data? what is the . and the fact that it's there twice doing?
<nrem>	thomas_d: group.
<thomas_d>	group.user or user.group?
<bls>	thomas_d: the piece after the '.' is the group
<keypusher>	user.group
<nrem>	chown user:group /path == chown user /path; chgrp group /path
<nrem>	errrr, colon or dot, both work
<thomas_d>	is it compulsory or can u just do the command for a user or for a group?
<nrem>	you can do chown user /path
<nrem>	but.. easiest thing is to tell you to man chown
<thomas_d>	cool thanks
<nrem>	you can also do stuff like "chown user. /path" which will change the group to whatever user's primary group is
<nrem>	or you can "chown .group /path" which is the same as just "chgrp group /path"
<jarlopez>	ohcanada: Easy now, sassafrass. If you're not in the mood to help, don't bite.
<ayecee>	jarlopez: it doesn't help your case to pull attitude either.
<nrem>	jarlopez: can you pastebin your xorg log?
<ohcanada>	jarlopez: i'm not biting squire. you STILL haven't given enough info for anyone to help you sort this
<jarlopez>	Reinstalling the graphics driver and reconfiguring xserver resolved the issue.
<nrem>	jarlopez: yay!
<ohcanada>	ayecee: when i was starting out, i was *ruthlessly* scorned and cajoled into actually getting my finger out and doing stuff for myself instead of demanding that other people fix my self-inflicted problems. anyways, all is well

<ayecee>	well, nice -n -12
<ayecee>	i don't think --12 works
<jadew>	it can be negative

At the very least, can anyone recommend a voip server that I could reasonably easil
<Es0teric>	ayecee alright thanks!
<bls>	IanWizard-Cloud: talked to the asterisk people?
<IanWizard-Cloud>	I will say up front, this is my first foray into messing with voip / pbx beyond that of an average (technical) user.

<IanWizard-Cloud>	spreeuw: lol.
<MrElendig>	spreeuw: redirect to a charity number
<Es0teric>	ayecee and if the files currently exist, they will be overwritten right?
<MrElendig>	one of those that you call to give 50$ to some scammers who claim they will save some kids in africa

<Phrohdoh>	what’s the difference between pwd and cwd?
<Phrohdoh>	(bash)
<ayecee>	pwd prints the cwd
<Phrohdoh>	Thank you sir.

<naptr>	Es0teric: yes, they will be overwritten.
<Es0teric>	naptr alright cool
<Es0teric>	ayecee i saw you added a -t param to the cp
<Es0teric>	what does -t do ?
<Raverix>	Hello, Is there a preferred way to mv both regular and hidden files? For example, I try to do: mv /somedirectory/* /newdirectory/, but this doesn't move my .htaccess, and my .git, etc
<ayecee>	Es0teric: it makes you look in the manpage XD
<Es0teric>	ayecee lol i just did
<Es0teric>	funny you said that
<ayecee>	Es0teric: more seriously, it lets me put the destination first, followed by the source arguments.
<ayecee>	Es0teric: so i can use -exec ... +, which will put multiple arguments on the same line for one big cp invocation instead of a bunch of little ones.
<Es0teric>	ayecee ah i see now ok
<MrElendig>	Raverix: dotglob if you are using bash
<Es0teric>	ayecee so then all files in subdirectories will be copied over without the subdirectories themselves?
<naptr>	Es0teric: you have every right to "man cp" and look for a -t option yourself. =)
<Es0teric>	naptr i saw already
<Es0teric>	i just wanted to be clear on it
<Es0teric>	thats all
<Raverix>	MrElendig: I am using bash, but I don't see a manual entry for dotglob.
<ayecee>	Es0teric: yes
<ayecee>	Raverix: it's in the bash manpage.
<MrElendig>	Raverix: man -P "less -p ' .dotglob'" bash
<ayecee>	ooh, advanced
<Raverix>	MrElendig: Reading now, thank you for your help.
<Es0teric>	if i get this: `cp: will not overwrite just-created` it means that the file was already overwritten in a short time span so it wouldnt make sense to overwrite it again right?
<ayecee>	it probably means that you have the same filename in different subdirectories in the source.
<Es0teric>	ayecee ok so how do i force an overwrite of that?
<ayecee>	are you sure you'd want to? will it get the right one?
<Es0teric>	ayecee i am copying over from the backup into the current one
<Es0teric>	so yeah
<ayecee>	i don't know. i'd guess one of -f, -u, or --remove-destination
<ayecee>	or maybe even -i
<Es0teric>	ayecee ok so then would it be find . -type f -exec cp -i -t destination {} + ?

<ayecee>	}: how about "fuser -vm /mountpoint" as root?

<}>	ayecee, that says : /mnt/acer64:         root     kernel mount /mnt/acer64
<naptr>	Es0teric: OK, just wanted to make sure you are clear on it. your backup has the same filename in multiple directories, not including the destination directory.
<Es0teric>	naptr no its only the same on the source directory (backup) and the destination

<ayecee>	Es0teric: that's not what the error indicates.

<}>	journeyman, that's not dangerous is it? "lazy unmount"
<journeyman>	I like to play fast and loose with my filesystems
<journeyman>	live on the edge
<journeyman>	honestly, it is probably fine. The real risk would come from something writing to it
<ayecee>	}: lazy unmount is not as dangerous as a force unmount, but you won't be able to remount it until it's actually unmounted.
<journeyman>	but if lsof doesn't show anything its most likely fine
<}>	ok
<ayecee>	Es0teric: gotta find the problem first, is the answer.
<Es0teric>	ayecee its asking me if i want to overwrite like.. 400 files
<Es0teric>	i just want it to auto overwrite
<journeyman>	ayecee: actually its the other way around, a force mount doesn't really foce, a lazy mount umounts no matter what
<Es0teric>	-i is not what i want
<ayecee>	Es0teric: okay, use -u
<}>	I don't  really understand how its possible that lsof and fuser show nothing, yet umount complains
<ayecee>	Es0teric: or, --remove-destination
<ayecee>	}: selinux? virtual machine?
<Es0teric>	ayecee the source is not newer than the destination
<}>	ayecee, no neither
<ayecee>	Es0teric: then --remove-destination
<ayecee>	}: i am also unsure then.
<}>	!!! I know
<}>	I fugired it out
<}>	I had another fs mounted in that fs
<ayecee>	oh, weird

<ayecee>	bu5hm4n: you know you're doing something wrong if someone else has the same problem? i don't understand the logic.
<bu5hm4n>	if someone else can also not do mathod calls out of a dbus inspector I know that my setup is the same than the one of the guy
<bu5hm4n>	so its more possible I am using the api wrong :D
<ayecee>	how would you know that?
<ayecee>	they could have the same error for completely different reasons.
<bu5hm4n>	okay then it doesnt help, so is here someone which can help me with the dbus api of udisks ?
<bu5hm4n>	2
<aias>	can anyone is it possible to use an idevice with a linux machine efficiently (and usefully) ?
<ayecee>	bu5hm4n: what do you need help with?
<ayecee>	aias: in what way?
<bu5hm4n>	how to execute the Mount funktion out of the FIlesystem Interface without getting a MethodNotFound ^^
<bazhang>	no itunes for linux aias
<ayecee>	bu5hm4n: what method are you calling?
<aias>	ayecee: in a was that involves ditching itunes
<Es0teric>	ayecee ok so i used --remove-destination
<aias>	*way
<bu5hm4n>	Mount
<Es0teric>	and i keep getting the same errror
<tblake3>	ayecee is there a way to install an OS (mepis in my case) without booting from either usb or dvd?
<ayecee>	bu5hm4n: i'm not sure what you mean. dbus methods are usually longer than that.
<aias>	being able to manage content like with an andriod (or any other computer), in a way where you can simply transfer files from the linux machine to the idevice without restriction
<ayecee>	tblake3: network boot? *shrug*
<}>	tblake3, some OSes allow installing from an existing linux OS
<ayecee>	aias: hmm, not without jailbreaking it.
<aias>	ayecee: for example, i have a few movies and some mp3s that i'd like to get on there
<bu5hm4n>	long version : org.freedesktop.udisks2.Filesystem.Mount
<ayecee>	aias: on the idevice i had, i used a third party music player that supported ftp transfers.
<EriC^^>	aias: i think you can use itunes with wine
<bu5hm4n>	ayecee: udisksctl works, so the setup should be fine or ?
<EriC^^>	aias: rhythmbox supports mp3 stuff, i couldn't get it to work so well though
<ayecee>	bu5hm4n: i don't know. does udisksctl use dbus?
<ayecee>	bu5hm4n: if it does, i wonder if there's a way to show its dbus interactions.
<Es0teric>	how do i make cp overwrite the file and stop giving me this notice > cp: will not overwrite just-created ?
<bu5hm4n>	ayecee: mhmm looking for that :)
<Es0teric>	adding --remove-destination still produces the same notice
<ayecee>	Es0teric: in the find command, use \; instead of +
<Es0teric>	ok ayecee  whats the difference between those two
<Es0teric>	?
<ayecee>	Es0teric: the difference is that it will copy one file at a time, so you won't have an invocation of cp that's trying to copy the same filename twice.
<Es0teric>	ayecee ah i see now
<michele>	hi!
<michele>	http://pastie.org/private/vj6oofgew9hdrku1e4qcyw why does ubuntu show a row with -/+ buffers/cache whilst fedora not?
<ayecee>	michele: fedora uses a different version of "free" that no longer shows that line.
<michele>	ayecee: :( that line was useful to see how much ram i was using!
<ayecee>	michele: the new version shows the same information.
<michele>	that's right ayecee! thanks :)
<bu5hm4n>	ayecee: okay I captured with dbus-monitor --system "type='method_call'" and I did not see anything so its no using dbus or ?
<ayecee>	guess so
<bu5hm4n>	damn
<toothe>	what's that command to update your database or libraries?
*	sven_oostenbrink is now known as phoenixz
<ayecee>	toothe: what the hell?
<saymoo>	toothe, what do you mean?
<bazhang>	updatedb?
<ayecee>	toothe: did that question make sense to you after you wrote it?
<toothe>	database OF libraries, pardon.
<ayecee>	not much better.
<ayecee>	ldconfig?
<saymoo>	what distro toothe
<saymoo>	please elaborate what you are trying to accomplish exactly
<toothe>	so, i just installed libressl. When I type in `openssl version`, it says it cannot find libssl.so.32. I vaguely recall that you are supposed to update a database of all your libraries. Perhaps I'm mistaken....
<toothe>	it was ldconfig.
<gorroth>	hey there
<saymoo>	hey
<gorroth>	okay, got a ghetto question.  is there a way to make linux create symlinks instead of hard links when someone does "ln a b"?  i know that sounds weird, but on my dev machine (guest linux in a windows host), vboxfs is giving me lots of issues
<gorroth>	and getting things converted over to vmware/vagrant is a big deal atm, and i don't have a ton of time if there's a shortcut i can take for now
<Ccomp5950>	alias ln='ln -s' ?
<ayecee>	gorroth: ln -s
<gorroth>	this is deep down in python distutils
<gorroth>	so i want to tell the OS itself to convert hard link queries to symlink queries
<ayecee>	good luck with that
<gorroth>	it can be done if i rewrite portions of the OS kernel
<gorroth>	i'm just wondering if there's something for that case already builtin
<saymoo>	why not change the python script so it makes symbolic links?
<gorroth>	it's some deep stuff in distutils that i don't want to hack every time i work on different projects
<bu5hm4n>	okay, another question, what could cause a normally defined interface function to endup with MethodNotFound ?
<gorroth>	like in core distutils
<gorroth>	not in our own tools
<bls>	and a custom kernel is more straightforward than changing some python?
<gorroth>	read what i wrote, please
<gorroth>	i said it CAN be done by me rewriting portions of kernel code
<gorroth>	but i am wondering if there is anything already built in to change how linux treats hard link requests
<toothe>	sorry for my unclear question.
<bls>	you could maybe pull a trick with LD_PRELOAD and mock link(2) and symlink(2)
<saymoo>	as mentioned before, set an alias, so every call to the ln command is translated to ln -s from script you run.. (or maybe you are a bit vague, on what creates the hardlinks, is it a script, a blob or what?)
<toothe>	gah....im doing something wrong with specifying --with-ssl with apache. I'm trying to compile with libressl, but SSLv3 is still enabled....
<toothe>	im doing something wrong.
<nector>	hello
*	Sarge123 is now known as Sarge123^off
*	GreenDay is now known as Kepler186
<saymoo>	hello
<nector>	i have a problem mounting shares can you help?
<ayecee>	can't help if you don't describe the problem
<nector>	it says mount error(5) input/output error
<gorroth>	bls, hmm, you might be right.  that would be a good trick
<DJHenjin>	Im working on a data deduplication program for block layer file dedupe, and i was wondering if i need to make a module to implement the system in, so that file access is transparent to the OS
<ayecee>	nector: describe it more completely
<phogg>	nector: Provide the exact command line you ran.
<nector>	ok
<saymoo>	nector, what are you trying to mount, what distro, what commands you tried.. etc
<phogg>	DJHenjin: doesn't btrfs already support that natively?
<ayecee>	phogg: cow isn't quite the same as dedupe
<DJHenjin>	Im working on a new one with a new technique
<ayecee>	or, does btrfs also do dedupe?
<ayecee>	DJHenjin: you'd probably have to make a module, yes
<bls>	unless you want to start off your new FS as a FUSE layer
<ayecee>	DJHenjin: it's hard to imagine how that would work without filesystem support, though.
<DJHenjin>	Thanks ayecee, i figured i would have to. My plan is to create essentially a new filesystem
<nector>	mount -t cifs //192.168.1.105/Music -o username=Mike,password=test /media/Music
<nector>	command wrong?
<ayecee>	nector: nothing obviously wrong there.
<phogg>	ayecee: https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Deduplication
<ayecee>	phogg: oh, cool
<nector>	no i dont understand either
<Remram>	Ok so, here's the fun:
<DJHenjin>	The comma between the username and password should be a space?
<saymoo>	nector, try looking at the errors in the logs
<Remram>	old GNU tar versions don't have --skip-old-files, but --keep-old-files behave that way
<saymoo>	on the server and client
<nector>	i have kernel 3.14.2 it says 3.13 had cifs bug but im not sure its fixed in 3.14
<saymoo>	perhaps you made a booboo on the server config
<ayecee>	DJHenjin: i don't think so, those are arguments to -o, and those are separated by ,
<Remram>	new versions of GNU tar have --skip-old-files, and --keep-old-files fails if it encounters an existing files
<phogg>	nector: the kernel has supposed CIFS for many years
<Remram>	why the hell would you change behavior of basic tar options in 2015!?
<Remram>	like, how am I supposed to use tar in any script?
<DJHenjin>	ayecee, i have always seperated the args to -o with spaces, worth a shot isnt it?
<phogg>	Remram: Feature test it first
<Remram>	how?
<ayecee>	DJHenjin: could you give an example where that worked?
<Remram>	I would need to create temporary files and stuff
<nector>	saymoo: the share machine is windows
<phogg>	Remram: if you run tar --skip-old-options and stderr's first line contains "unrecognized" expect old behavior, otherwise expect new
<ayecee>	Remram: what did previous versions do?
<nector>	i dont think it has samba.conf
<DJHenjin>	Nector, try using \ instead of /
<phogg>	Remram: er, I mean skip-old-files of course
<ayecee>	DJHenjin: no, // is correct
<saymoo>	nector, no, it doesn't.. but what is the exact error the client gives? (check the client log)
<Remram>	ayecee: --skip-old-files (and previously, --keep-old-files) don't overwrite existing files when untaring
<ayecee>	i see
<Remram>	the new --keep-old-files fails with an error if encountering a file that would be overwritten
<ayecee>	that _is_ unexpected.
<ayecee>	Remram: i can't seem to find an example describing the old behavior, though.
<phogg>	Remram: tar-skip-option () { grep -q unrecognized <<<$(tar --skip-old-files 2>&1) && printf -- '--keep-old-files' || printf -- '--skip-old-files' ; }
<DJHenjin>	im just offering suggestions i think of, remembered the comma is correct. Just want to cover all the candidates
<phogg>	Remram: this feature test returns the switch you need to get skip-old-files behavior with old or new tar
<ayecee>	DJHenjin: i'm helping out by pointing out which suggestions don't work
<phogg>	Remram: unless I have the thing backwards; please test before trusting me (-;
<ayecee>	DJHenjin: keep 'em coming :)
<Remram>	yeah I see
<Remram>	well that makes my command-line even funnier
<Remram>	command-line size limit is 2MB right?
<phogg>	Remram: I thought you said it was a script
<DJHenjin>	Try without the // in front of the ip perhaps?
<Remram>	it's a script that is one line
<ayecee>	DJHenjin: nope, the format is correct
<Remram>	keeps getting longer
<phogg>	Remram: instead of saying --skip-old-files you say $(tar-skip-option); after expansion it's the same, before it's not much different.
<phogg>	Remram: scripts that are one line are usually buggy, so there you are. Make it two lines, make it ten. What does it matter?
<Remram>	I run it through SSH
<phogg>	Remram: again... so?
<Remram>	SSH takes a single command-line
<phogg>	Once the script is saved to a file it's a command. Commands are easy to run anywhere.
<Remram>	everytime I start or stop a Docker container, spotify stops playing music for a second, is that supposed to happen?
<Psi-Jack>	Remram: No, but it's likely network interuptions and stupid clients.
<ayecee>	Remram: nope
<DJHenjin>	Im out of ideas then, i best get back to work on my dedupe project. Later all
<nector>	saymoo: i dont understand what it says
<saymoo>	hmm
*	saymoo neither from over here
<saymoo>	:)
<helpD>	Please guys, I recently used a command on my macbook pro terminal : pip install -U numpy scipy scikit-learn. The problem is I don't know where the installed files are located on my machine. Any linux command to search for them? Thanks
*	eag is now known as Guest96510
<Psi-Jack>	helpD: Welcome to ##linux. This isn't an OS X help channel.
<hassoon_>	Psi-Jack: help the dude man.
*	hassoon_ hides
<helpD>	Psi-Jack: nope, I ran the commmand on the terminal. So, I believe the same linux command for finding files could also help
<Psi-Jack>	helpD: This isn't an OS X help channel. Frack off.
<nector>	saymoo: that help?
<helpD>	hassoon:thanks . I just desperately need to find those files and I couldn't find any good reseource online to help
<Psi-Jack>	OSX isn't even at all similar to Linux. Its kernel is based on FreeBSD, and Darwin.
<Psi-Jack>	helpD: So you'd be better off asking in #macosx or #python
<Psi-Jack>	##Linux is definitely 100% off-topic for this.
<acz32>	that doesn't justify being an asshole and telling them to "frack off"
<Psi-Jack>	It does, when his retort is "I did it in terminal so should be the same blah"
<helpD>	Psi-Jack: I am sorry if you were offended. Just thought I could get a pointer or help. Thanks though
<Psi-Jack>	helpD: You can. In the proper channels where your OS or programming tools are discussed.
<saptech>	how do you know he has OS X? He said he's using a Mac which can run Linux
<xangua>	maybe he has windows
<helpD>	saptech:exactly my point.
<Psi-Jack>	Uhh, no, not even at all your pooint, helpD.
<Psi-Jack>	:p
<dasabhi>	hello hello
<acz32>	helpD: which OS do you use?
<helpD>	acz32: I use OS x OS but I am working with the terminal. One could still run some linux command on the mac terminal.
<dasabhi>	hello fellow linux developers
<dasabhi>	do any of you know how to use a cross compiler?
<jacwib>	yay, i managed to fix weechat again. (bye)
<ayecee>	dasabhi: i have been known to dabble in the field of cross compilation.
<kurahaupo>	saptech: I think gcc discontinued support for the M68000 cpu a while back, so getting Linux to run on a mac that doesn't also have osx would be challenging
<dasabhi>	sounds good mate i had a few questions
<acz32>	helpD: no. OS X is not linux, even if it's unix. it's closer to BSD which have different versions of commands in some cases. ask in the relevant channel
<Psi-Jack>	helpD: No, they can't. OS X doesn't have /any/ Linux commands.
<saptech>	helpD, look in Application folder
<dasabhi>	i am trying to cross compile a linux kernel for my raspberry pi
<Psi-Jack>	kurahaupo: Uhh. Mac's use Intel CPUs now-a-days.
<FreezingCold>	Hmm, what do you guys suggest for a SOCKS proxy?
<Psi-Jack>	:p
<ayecee>	FreezingCold: dante is probably the most common one.
<FauxReal>	ive used OSX for 10yr to admin linux boxes... its not linux.. as acz32  stated above.
<FreezingCold>	ayecee: yeah I was looking at dante.
<kurahaupo>	helpD: you could ask in #bash if it's generic scripting you want help with
<helpD>	Psi-Jack: on my terminal I could type commands like : ls, cd, rm mv, et.c
<malaprop>	Psi-Jack: If by Linux commands helpD means standard *nix utils, he/she's got them
<Psi-Jack>	grep --version
<dasabhi>	ayecee have you cross compiled for the rpi?
<Psi-Jack>	grep (BSD grep) 2.5.1-FreeBSD
<Psi-Jack>	That's not even GNU Grep on OS X :)
<ayecee>	dasabhi: not specifically, no.
<Psi-Jack>	malaprop: Wrong again.
<dasabhi>	hmm what did you cross compile for?
<ayecee>	dasabhi: a different arm-based platform.
<kurahaupo>	Psi-Jack: exactly, and all the Intel CPU Mac's come with a licence for osx
<malaprop>	Psi-Jack: ?
<dasabhi>	like?
<ayecee>	dasabhi: one that you will never ever encounter.
<helpD>	I even ran this command on the terminal and it worked! : pip install -U numpy scipy scikit-learn
<Psi-Jack>	malaprop: ^^ See grep version on an actual OS X.. That's not a "Linux command" that's an OS X command, from BSD. :p
<acz32>	helpD: pip is a python program and has nothing to do with linux
<diegoviola>	OSX is meh
<malaprop>	Psi-Jack: You mean GNU, not Linux. rms is on his way, prepare yourself
<malaprop>	Psi-Jack: :-)
<dasabhi>	i am curious what kind of embedded board was this ayecee?
<ayecee>	dasabhi: it's good to be curious.
<dasabhi>	cant give me an answer? :S
<ayecee>	no
<kurahaupo>	Psi-Jack: "Linux" is only the kernel, so to assert that a command is not a Linux command because it's not the GNU version is a bit of a stretch
<dasabhi>	what kind of secretive thing? ahaha
<ayecee>	dasabhi: do you have questions about cross compiling?
<dasabhi>	yes i do
<dasabhi>	i am trying to understand the process of cross compiling for the rpi through my ubuntu machine

<Psi-Jack>	kurahaupo: Right. So as is, NOTHING in OS X is a "linux command", because it's not using the Linux kernel.
<dasabhi>	dont really know how to compile the kernel from there on
<ayecee>	FreezingCold: i don't know how to begin answering that.
<Psi-Jack>	BOOOM!
<ayecee>	dasabhi: the git repo of the toolchain, or what?
<FreezingCold>	ayecee: like... lighter weight?
<dasabhi>	oh i have the tool chain as well
<dasabhi>	its just in a different directory called tools
<dasabhi>	while the main one is called linux
<rapha>	Hi!
<rapha>	Is there anyone here for whom "echo 255 > /sys/class/leds/tpacpi\:\:thinklight/brightness" works, as in, turns the LED actually on?
<ayecee>	dasabhi: pretty straightforward. make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=/your/toolchain/prefix
<ayecee>	http://elinux.org/Raspberry_Pi_Kernel_Compilation#2._Cross_compiling_from_Linux
<ayecee>	dasabhi: with that, you'd hit the regular targets, make menuconfig, make zImage, make modules, etc.
<Froolap>	dasabhi: you might want to try in the #raspberrypi or read through the wiki in #fedora-arm and or #pidora  wiki.
<dasabhi>	btw the way when you guys talk to me your names are highlighted in yellow
<daninoz>	hi everyone, how do I change the shell to zsh? I tried with chsh but my user is a network user and it can't be determined
<dasabhi>	its like you guys select me and make sure i see the message
<dasabhi>	how do i do that?
<dasabhi>	like target one of you and make sure you guys can see my message
<Froolap>	dasabhi: well change your client so that my messages that are set to you are highlighted in blue.  I don't want yellow highlighted messages because people might think I'm a coward.
<dasabhi>	so i am using irssi ...? :S
<dasabhi>	and your name was highlighted in yellow for me
<dasabhi>	when you starting talking to me
<Froolap>	it's still in your clients control   :)
<kurahaupo_>	Psi-Jack: unless we're going to redirect all command line & scripting questions to #bash, it's appropriate that we should be a bit lenient about which versions of commands people are using as long as they're POSIX-compliant.
<FreezingCold>	ayecee: heh, what do you think about using dante instead of SSH's SOCKS?
<dasabhi>	and i see a "dasabhi:" before the text
<bunbasket>	test
<FreezingCold>	daninoz: Why not use bash?
<ayecee>	dasabhi: right, because that person typed the name.
<bunbasket>	is it possible to run x64 linux executables on an x86 32-bit only system?
<FreezingCold>	bunbasket: failure
<Psi-Jack>	kurahaupo_: When it comes to OS X users asking for help in ##Linux, it's innappropriate, period. Don't like it, you don't have to remain here.
<FreezingCold>	bunbasket: Yes.
<dasabhi>	ohhh okay let me try
<ayecee>	dasabhi: or more likely tab completed the name - hit a few characters of the name and hit tab
<FreezingCold>	dasabhi: What distro are you using?

<Voyage>	the owner of html dir is also group developer-group. developer is member of developer-group
<ayecee>	the group doesn't have write permission to the directory.
<Voyage>	hm
<Voyage>	how to change that
<sonant>	chgrp
<ayecee>	chmod g+w dir
<xeon-enouf>	ayecee: fwiw, (and i'm stuck in backscroll atm - and i'd like to thank kerframil for this info), you were sort of correct; re: cpufreq*, acpid, cpupower, etc -- now, (since 3.10-ish, and Nehalem, onto Sandy, Ivy, etc) it's config_x86_intel_pstate (and powerclamp, etc) Good info here; https://plus.google.com/+TheodoreTso/posts/2vEekAsG2QT
<ayecee>	not chgrp
<sonant>	oh
<Es0teric>	ok so new question
<Es0teric>	in ssh, when there is a broken pipe
<Es0teric>	how do i you see the progress of whatever was running before there was a broken pipe?
<ayecee>	you don't. it's gone.
<Psi-Jack>	Es0teric: You start
<Psi-Jack>	Es0teric: by not
<Psi-Jack>	Es0teric: using enter as punctuation. :)
<Es0teric>	Psi-Jack sure
<Voyage>	ayecee,  thanks. how to copy including all files. hidden and what not
<Psi-Jack>	Appreciate it. :)
<Es0teric>	Psi-Jack and the answer to my question is....?
<ayecee>	Voyage: how to copy what?
<Psi-Jack>	Oh, sorry, I stopped reading once there was no question by the second line. :p
<Voyage>	ayecee,  cp -R /some/path/dir
<ayecee>	Voyage: cp -R should do that, yes
<Voyage>	ayecee,  cp -R /some/path/dir     this does not includes hidden files
<ayecee>	it doesn't?
<Voyage>	corrent
<Voyage>	the .files
<Psi-Jack>	Yes it would.
<ayecee>	Voyage: you're not doing something like cp -R /some/path/dir/*, are you?
<Psi-Jack>	If you used *, no, it would not, but with the directory itself, yes it will.
<Voyage>	ayecee,  oh. yes I am
<Psi-Jack>	heh
*	Fisheh is now known as MonkehParade
<ayecee>	there's the problem
<EriC^^>	use cp -r /some/path/dir/. /destination
<EriC^^>	if you want the hidden files too without copying the whole dir there
<Voyage>	Psi-Jack,  well I need the contents of /home/ubuntu/wp  to be pasted inside /var/www/html .....
<ayecee>	Voyage: the shell expands *, and it doesn't include dotfiles by default. you can change that with dotglob, described in dash manpage.
<EriC^^>	( i mean just the files in it )
<Psi-Jack>	Voyage: So use rsync.
<Es0teric>	so... in ssh, when there is a broken pipe, how do i you see the progress of whatever was running before there was a broken pipe?
<ayecee>	err, bash manpage.
<Psi-Jack>	rsync -avh /path/to/origin/ /path/to/destination/
<Psi-Jack>	Note the specific endings of each path has /
<ayecee>	EriC^^'s solution sounds good too.
<Voyage>	Psi-Jack,  ayecee  hm. how to do it by cp?
<Psi-Jack>	YOu use rsync. :)
<ayecee>	/some/path/dir/.
<Psi-Jack>	Or prepare to do manual changes after. or, yeah, .
*	32NABWS4J is now known as phoenixz
<Voyage>	Psi-Jack,  rsync error: some files/attrs were not transferred (see previous errors) (code 23) at main.c(1183) [sender=3.1.0]
*	foofoobar_ is now known as foofoobar
<ayecee>	gotta see the previous errors, i guess
<Es0teric>	ok so
<Psi-Jack>	Uh huh. What source filesystem and what destination filesystem? I sense something's not POSIX compliant. :P
<Max-P>	Hi, does anyone know a good way to load a GPT table from backup into a *smaller* disk? I made a backup of each partitions using dd and backed up the GPT using sgdisk -b, but now I can't find a way to replicate that GPT table to the smaller disk (it refuses to even save and let me manually fix the problem)
<Voyage>	Psi-Jack,  same FS
<Es0teric>	how do i find out if my program finished execution before the broken pipe occured?
<Voyage>	I just did rsync -avh /home/ubuntu/wp/ /var/www/html/
<Psi-Jack>	Voyage: As root?
<EriC^^>	Voyage: do you have write access at /var/www/html ?
<EriC^^>	Max-P: why don't you create a new partition table, and mount the partitions and rsync everything back?
<Max-P>	EriC^^, the disk may contain Windows 8 partitions I don't want to touch, so I want everything to be as close as possible to the original disk so the recovery partition and stuff still works
<EriC^^>	Max-P: i think if the partition sizes change the recovery system stops working, sometimes anyways
<Max-P>	And GPT seems to have a lot more options than the good old simple MBR, so I don't know how to recreate the partitions perfectly with the right GUID and attributes
<EriC^^>	Max-P: you can still extract the recovery image if you ever need to do a recovery though
<Max-P>	EriC^^, I do. I have a full backup of the original GPT and all its partitions on my external drive. The thing is, I now want to restore them back as I'm selling the computer, so I want to restore it to stock. But I don't have the original drive anymore, and the new one is smaller
*	FLHerne_ is now known as FLHerne
<EriC^^>	Max-P: well you don't have any bootloaders with gpt and uefi so it won't be a problem, just copy the partitions contents and make a proper entry in your efibootmgr using a linux distro and efibootmgr
<EI24>	hi, im trying to paste code from a pdf doc to the "text editor" program. However when i paste it, the code become messed up.
<Es0teric>	so no one knows?
<EriC^^>	Max-P: or maybe windows can do that, ask in ##windows about that
<EriC^^>	Max-P: ok, i've no idea
<mzgnr>	Hello people, I want to ask you a question. I'm about get hired by a company as a Software Engineer and its my first professional job :) . When I get my first sallary I want to buy a notebook/laptop which Linux can run on it w/o issues. And I want it to be light and have long battery life. Can you recommend any notebook or laptop for me ?
<linuxthefish>	does rsync need a server or can it work with openssh?
<Psi-Jack>	rsync needs to be on both origin and destination.
<Psi-Jack>	The tunnel it traverses is normally ssh, or rsyncd.
<Max-P>	Why can't cgdisk just have a "move partition" option ._. It does everything I need perfectly, I just need to move the partitions to the right place, everything else loads up just fine...
<sonant>	mzgnr: i would recommend google
<sonant>	possibly by looking at best supported hardware and drivers
<EriC^^>	Max-P: try gparted maybe?
<bazhang>	system76 or zareason for that mzgnr
<Psi-Jack>	System76, where computers should only ever last 1 year, tops. Good luck with that. :)
<MetaNova>	mzgnr: linux runs great on my Lenovo
<skapunker>	mzgnr: The Dell XPS 13 DE comes with it pre-loaded.  The Lenoxo X1 is commonly used one.  The Chromebook Pixel 2 might also be a nice option.
<MetaNova>	mzgnr: which includes the wireless network interface and card reader
<sonant>	linuxthefish: it works fine with ssh
<sonant>	rsync -rvP user@123.123.123.123:/home/dir ./
<sonant>	actually
<sonant>	yeah
<sonant>	-e 'ssh -p port' if you're doing any weird ports for ssh
<Max-P>	EriC^^, Too high level for what I need. I'll try coping the first 3 partitions and see if it boots, I'll worry about recovery partitions later
<dbclk>	hey guys...having an issue running apache running on a few ports
<dbclk>	  folks question..i'm trying to listen on a few ports using apache and I'm getting that the ports are being used
<dbclk>	when I run netstat | grep 8554
<dbclk>	i'm seeing this -> unix  3      [ ]         STREAM     CONNECTED     8554
<dbclk>	what does STREAM means?
<MetaNova>	try feeding netstat the switch which shows what processes are using each port
*	joseph is now known as Guest14870
<Psi-Jack>	Stop using deprecated netstat, use ss.
<dbclk>	MetaNova: not understanding what you're saying sorry
<EriC^^>	Max-P: is it win8?
<Max-P>	EriC^^, Yes
<MetaNova>	dbclk: netstat -tulpna | grep 8554
<EriC^^>	Max-P: you need to add the efi entry to your boot manager probably
<Psi-Jack>	ss -lnp
<MetaNova>	or ss -lnp | grep 8554
<EriC^^>	Max-P: actually it might still be there and work if you used the same partition table and partitions, nevermind
<dbclk>	I think that's just the process ID MetaNova ..I'm just seeing 4
<Max-P>	EriC^^, Yeah, the only change made is the disk, to a smaller one. Everything else is intact.
<MetaNova>	dbclk: should be the right-most argument
<EriC^^>	Max-P: if it doesn't try pressing esc or something to get the boot options, then choose boot from file .. /Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi or /Boot/bootx64.efi
<CHVNX>	http://computefreely.org
<MetaNova>	dbclk: tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:53            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      792/named
<dbclk>	ahh ok
<dbclk>	sorry
<dbclk>	yeah you're right
<MetaNova>	792 is the pid, named is the process name
<Max-P>	I'm currently copying the first 3 partitions, those fits the new disk and it contains the OS partition I had shrunk for that purpose. I'll see if it boots. I can only imagine it will, given it has the same UUID and everything
<MetaNova>	Max-P: did you copy the MBR?
<Max-P>	Metacity, I should yes. I backed up the disk structure with "sgdisk -b" which should back up the GPT. At least it backed up the protective MBR from what the utilities say
<Max-P>	oops
<Max-P>	MetaNova, **
<MetaNova>	okay, cool
<balloonface>	anybody happen to have any experience with the iptables lens in augeas? Any issues with it? It's been listed as "experimental" for the last few years
<EriC^^>	Max-P: there's no mbr with gpt, that's just a fake mbr so other os's don't think theres no partition table and try to make one or something
<balloonface>	just wondering if it's generally safe for production use
<dbclk>	MetaNova: I'm getting this -> unix  3      [ ]         STREAM     CONNECTED     8554   1126/master
<dbclk>	1126/master what's that?
<balloonface>	looks like postfix, if I had to guess
<MetaNova>	the pid is 1126 and the process name is master
<MetaNova>	reference 'ps aux f' to determine more information about it
<dbclk>	ok
<dbclk>	MetaNova: http://pastie.org/10161342 ..seems like postfix/master

<supay>	anyway to get /dev/audio?

<maurer>	root@mimung:/home/maurer# ip link add veth0 type veth
<maurer>	RTNETLINK answers: File exists
<maurer>	any ideas what that error means?
<aias>	you can do anything in linux
<Max-P>	maurer, It means there's already a veth0
<maurer>	(there is not an interface named veth0)
<maurer>	>_>
<supay>	Psi-Jack: but how would you do it on a random linux dist?
<Psi-Jack>	...
<maurer>	Max-P: http://pastebin.com/AAu9Gj29 are my interfaces
<ohcanada>	aias: is user a member of the admin group?
<aias>	ohcanada: no
<Max-P>	You may not see it, but it must already exist somewhere, otherwise "File exists" wouldn't make sense
<Psi-Jack>	supay: Kali is not a desktop distro, get over it. Stop trying to use it as if it is.
<maurer>	Max-P: does "ip link" not list all interfaces?
<supay>	Psi-Jack: alright alright.. i'll get Ubuntu! ugh :P
<aias>	yuck!
<aias>	on the same kernel you can make any distro any other distro, right
<aias>	it's all a matter of configuration
<ohcanada>	aias: does user have write permission on the containing dir, that the offending dir is in?
<aias>	ah, yes!
<aias>	user does
<maurer>	Max-P: Also, I'm pretty sure I don't have a secret interface named whargarbl
<maurer>	and yet:
<maurer>	root@mimung:/home/maurer# ip link add name whargarbl type veth
<maurer>	RTNETLINK answers: File exists
<Max-P>	maurer, Mmmh, yeah, I just tried it on my box, it seems it always exist no matter what I enter
<maurer>	Max-P: notably, if I don't try to name it, e.g. ip link add type veth; it works fine
<maurer>	If it's "You can't name these interfaces" that's fine, but File exists seems an odd error
<ohcanada>	aias: imagine a dir is a file. if you have write permission, you can edit it. that means you can create, rename and delete things in that dir
<Max-P>	It's a very odd error for sure. Usually when ip returns that error, it does exist. Maybe the command doesn't do what we think it does?
*	Fisheh is now known as MonkehParade
<dbclk>	weird ..I killed the postfix process and netstat isnt' showing anything using the port
<dbclk>	netstat -tlop | grep 8554..shows nothing but, when I try to run service httpd start

*	sasha is now known as Guest89957
<Max-P>	maurer, Well I don't know. I just tried with something that's not a veth and now it works. I'm assuming since it creates veths in pair, it does weird things when you try to name them
<qwyos>	Does Linux or a file system store a log of file operations (copy, move, delete etc.) somewhere?
<Psi-Jack>	qwyos: In bash history files, if enabled, and properly saved. Otherwise, no.
<Froolap>	jpurnaled filesystem?
<koala_man>	qwyos: file systems like that exist
<qwyos>	What about e.g. copying a file from, say ext4 HDD to a fat32 pendrive? It's not stored anywhere?
<qwyos>	I was thinking of like a global file operations log managed by the kernel or something.
<ohcanada>	qwyos: if it was done in a shell that keeps a history, then yes. otherwise no
<qwyos>	ohcanada: doesn't bash_history just keeps a log of commands issued in the terminal?
<ohcanada>	correct
<ohcanada>	qwyos: some file managers have "undo", which implies a sort of history
<RayTracer>	qwyos: you can also use the audit framework to monitor things (auditctl)
<ohcanada>	if you monitor and log everything, nothing ever gets done :)
<ohcanada>	imagine if the log had to be logged, and the log of the log had to be logged, and ......
<Ruum>	hey guys how do I use scp and pipe it with using find?

*	sins-_i is now known as sins-
<Ruum>	I am trying to scp files that only meet my search terms from the find command.
<MetaNova>	that's not how you use find
<qwyos>	I think auditctl looks exactly like what I was thinking about, heh. Neat.
<C0MPAQ>	man tr no more UTF-8
<ohcanada>	Ruum: ok then. a couple of choices. 1) store the filenames in a temp var and scp them in one go, or use -exec flag to find and scp them one at a time
<C0MPAQ>	I will never forget this day
<C0MPAQ>	I was like an hour in shock
<MetaNova>	Ruum: that's also not how scp works .. are you doing the find remotely?
<Ruum>	I have already sshed into the box
<EriC^^>	how do you remove the first entry from find when you want the hidden files only?
<ohcanada>	EriC^^: which first entry?
<MetaNova>	Ruum: Ruum: find / -name \*string\* -exec scp {} user@host:/some/directory/
<Ruum>	now I just want to use the results from the find parameters to download those files to my local machine
<EriC^^>	somebody mentioned how one time, i think it was ayecee

<ohcanada>	or .[^.]*
<EriC^^>	ohcanada: thanks

<Flynnn>	I'm trying to upgrade my Raspbian Wheezy machine to Raspbian Jessie
<q0m>	question:  how do I import an ssh-rsa key into my linux box so a co-worker can login
<Flynnn>	I have about 2GB/8GB free when wheezy is installed on its own -- so I should have enough space left after Jessie is installed too, I can't imagine Jessie taking up two additional GB of space
<Flynnn>	Problem is, sudo apt-get dist-upgrade fails due to no hard disk space left
<Flynnn>	Anything I can do?
<spreeuw>	tune2fs
<spreeuw>	turn reserved space to 0%
<spreeuw>	not sure if its that
<spreeuw>	since you install as root
<MetaNova>	q0m: create a user for them, add their public ssh key to /home/theiraccount/.ssh/authorized_hosts
<spreeuw>	and make sure your /tmp is big enough
<spreeuw>	in ram
<Flynnn>	Spreeuw: I am not sure how to tell if /tmp is big enough
<Flynnn>	I will rune tun2fs as soon as I can -- what does turning reserved space to 0% do?
<ohcanada>	Flynnn: it frees up 5%, which is normally reserved for root. which might be enough to get you going. then start uninstalling the chaff

<adrian_1908>	hello, i have a question regarding gnu bash. I want to create an alias that cds to a directory and then runs a program with an existing file as its parameter. When i run these commands manually, the program opens detached from the terminal process, but using the alias, it blocks the terminal until i close it.
<adrian_1908>	Is there a straight forward way to change this behavior?
<Psi-Jack>	reisio: Yeah, got me a hefty little chef server & node vagrant deployment setup here, allowing me to do full-scale chef testing.
<koala_man>	adrian_1908: the general rule about aliases is that if you have to ask, you should use a function instead

<nrem>	(i.e.: sysadmins think the opposite of you about their pay)

<koala_man>	I did data entry for $8/hour once. After two days of that soul crushing crap, I found out that the long reams of dot-matrix printed paper was printed "for my convenience", and that they actually had it in electronic form.
<reisio>	krasnayarsk: mmmm, you can probably get a copy of wiktionary's db quite simply
<nrem>	Already looked at man.
<reisio>	wouldn't be the worst dictionary ever
<RedStarComrade>	yea i just do basic IT/helpdesk
<RedStarComrade>	i just make 15/hr
<krasnayarsk>	reisio: Okay.... simple. Thanks.
<RedStarComrade>	i am looking into HTML, CSS, and Java
*	krasnayarsk hopes it's simple
<RedStarComrade>	front end stuff
<Psi-Jack>	nrem: If you did, you would know what those fields were.
<nrem>	Psi-Jack: I already said I do know what they are.
<reisio>	krasnayarsk: http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Help:FAQ#Downloading_Wiktionary
<nrem>	I just don't know what that means.
<Psi-Jack>	nrem: Then: Ask better questions.
<reisio>	krasnayarsk: and you can get a copy of any other dictionary if you want to work a little more
<RedStarComrade>	but yea, i always have sir isaac newtons quote in mind in terms of math and comp sci
<nrem>	What the heck are the virt/res/shr columns in top?
<nrem>	virtual resident shared
<RedStarComrade>	i sit on the shoulders of giants
<MetaNova>	nrem: you can always try googling "types of memory usage" or even .. "virtual vs resident vs shared"
<krasnayarsk>	reisio: Thanks for your help. I appreciate it.
<reisio>	mmhmmm
<nrem>	Yes. That was clearly what my question meant.
<nrem>	Clearly.
<nrem>	Heh. man top :p
<nrem>	I know they have to do with memory usage, but... <-- yes, clearly haven't done that, nope
<MetaNova>	nrem: quick and dirty: virtual is swap (+cached) usage, resident is physical RAM usage, shared is .. cached/inactive? I'm less positive on the difference of shared
<Psi-Jack>	nrem: virt is all total virtual memory a program would use, after loading in all libraries etc. As if it were totally 100% in memory. Thankfully, Linux shares open libraries memory and thus you have res, how much ACTUAL resident memory the program is consuming without all the loaded libraries along with it.
<codebam>	does anyone know of a cpu simulator for linux?
<Psi-Jack>	and shr, I'm sure you can guess what that is from the former two.
<reisio>	codebam: for what purpose?
<Psi-Jack>	Well, son of a....
<Loshki>	RedStarComrade: "If I have seen further it's because I have stood upon the shoulders of giants" wrote Isaac Newton to Robert Hooke. Rumor has it that he only said this because of his intense dislike for Hooke, who was unusually short. -- Lisa Randall, Warped Passages.
<codebam>	reisio: to learn asm
<RedStarComrade>	Loshki lol
<pid1>	codebam, QTSpim
<reisio>	there really a point in learning asm anymore?
<RedStarComrade>	but yea, thats what my calculus teacher taught me in college Loshki
<MetaNova>	reisio: yes
<codebam>	pid1: thanks, I'll check that out
<RedStarComrade>	i sit on the shoulders of giants
<pid1>	MIPSv32
<codebam>	reisio: of course there is
<Loshki>	I sit on their faces. Each to their own...
<reisio>	what?
<hagridaaron>	Hey!
<pid1>	I would definitely say it is valuable. I probably won't go diving into x86_64 assembly, but MIPS was honestly a joy to learn.
<pid1>	I certainly gained a new appreciation for the low-level work that goes into designing a CPU, and the considerations that have to be made when you're designing a compiler.
<hagridaaron>	I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with nginx. I need to enable slash commands. I'm trying to place a rewrite in the nginx.conf file, but it doesnt seem to work. I'm wondering if there is something going on with the sites-available and the sites-enabled directories. Those are pretty new to me. Anyone?
<reisio>	/msg alis list *nginx*
<reisio>	pid1: you designing a compiler?
<Psi-Jack>	hagridaaron: Have you tried asking an nginx channel?
<pid1>	reisio, Yup, this fall.
<pid1>	Final project for my compilers course.
<hagridaaron>	thanks reisio !
<Psi-Jack>	hagridaaron: Please do not PM. Use the dang channel.
<Psi-Jack>	[18:14] <hagridaaron> yeah there was no answer
<reisio>	pid1: cool
<pid1>	Very =) I'm really excited.
<hagridaaron>	Psi-Jack, how do I use dang channel? I'm new to irc as well
<hagridaaron>	oooh...
<Psi-Jack>	For IRC help, /join #freenode and ask them.
<pid1>	hagridaaron, Like that ^ Just be patient when waiting for an answer.
<pid1>	In some channels, you might not get a response for a half hour to an hour or more, but a lot of people lurk around.
<hagridaaron>	ah ok, thank you guys very much!
<eleventh>	Linux question: is there a way to pcsc11 visibly sign a pdf. I have tried google but have not found a way to sign the new army forms
<Psi-Jack>	eleventh: Have you tried using Adobe Acrobat Reader for linux?
<Psi-Jack>	I'll take the lack of answer to be a no. :)
<reisio>	who're you talking to?
<Psi-Jack>	^^ eleventh
<reisio>	eleventh, what a good name

<reisio>	was in this toy store with a friend looking for a special type of glue once
<reisio>	this guy was talking to the clerk about magic
<reisio>	they were really into it
<RedStarComrade>	i mean, you can run steam on linux, and then play duels of the planeswalker
<reisio>	the clerk had a lisp
<reisio>	the other guy's girlfriend was staring at the ceiling
<reisio>	was teh funny
<RedStarComrade>	also, steam on linux is pretty cool
<Freman>	Psi-Jack: sure it will, it's downloads that are hard to shape
<reisio>	it's about as cool as steam at all
<RedStarComrade>	i want to build a steambox with linux
<Freman>	having said that, I'm being ripped off "Upload: 1.07 Mbit/s"

<Psi-Jack>	eleventh: Stop asking questions then immediately going AFK. That's jsut downright rude.
<eleventh>	Sorry was beyond my control
<PercyB>	I still cannot believe it: I wanted to draw some basic lines and arrows on a pdf, and I had to go back to windows software. Draw did not open that particular pdf-file, otherwise there is nothing on linux that can do those tasks
<PercyB>	Having said that: is
<reisio>	PercyB: what can anyone say but that your comprehensive understanding of all software is unmatched
<PercyB>	I still love linux, would never go back to win again
<GreeningGalaxy>	hi, i'm not getting unicode input to work in GTK applications. You're supposed to be able to use control-shift-u [address] last I checked, but it isn't working at all for me
<Psi-Jack>	eleventh: Anyway, talk to Adobe about that, then. Only they can do their own propriatery stuff as per the situation you're in.
<checkmatein1>	CHVNX: lol
<reisio>	PercyB: PDF is a stupid format, but inkscape/cairo can handle it fine
<checkmatein1>	did you kline me when I posted e?
<checkmatein1>	bad move.
*	Somasis_ is now known as Somasis
<eleventh>	Psi-jack thanks
<PercyB>	reisio Inkscape can handle it, but not those particular tasks, I tried it out. Otherwise I like Inkscape, great software
<reisio>	PercyB: inkscape can handle it
*	reisio has been drawing lines for years
<reisio>	I draw the vertical
<PercyB>	reisio I mean arrows

<reisio>	Remram: so true
<krasnayarsk>	reisio: I've downloaded the xml file. Is there an easy to use ready to go application to read and query this 500MB file?
<Remram>	GreeningGalaxy: unicode input?
<EriC^^>	GreeningGalaxy: it's default in unity, which uses gtk
<jeffreylevesque>	Psi-Jack: so, it allows you to run other (make) commands simulataneously?

<pid1>	davo, Is the VM actually pointing to, and trying to boot from, the right virtual disk image?
<GreeningGalaxy>	pingfloyd: just found that. predictably, GNOME does not have any such setting anymore. :/
<reisio>	GreeningGalaxy: what's dpkg -l | grep -i ucode say?
<pingfloyd>	are you using gnome or xfce4?
<GreeningGalaxy>	reisio: nothin.
<GreeningGalaxy>	pingfloyd: xfce4.
<GreeningGalaxy>	the thread said to use gnome settings
<davo>	pid1: I think it is, by the way. It's a Mac OS X dmg image that I converted to an .iso image, and can mount and view the contents
<pid1>	I'm 98% sure you can't virtualize OSX.
<GreeningGalaxy>	reisio: couldn't find anything relevant in apt-cache search ucode either
<pid1>	They specifically check if it is running in a VM and prevent it from booting, IIRC.
<davo>	ah damn, wow that is interesting
<davo>	and good to consider
<pid1>	As I said, I'm not entirely sure, so check that.
<pid1>	It might have only started with a recent version of OSX.
<pid1>	I know you can't virtualize modern versions of it, but I don't know if it is still possible to get, for instance, 10.6 or earlier running, before they implemented that check.
<davo>	hm, perhaps so, being that what i'm trying to install is a OS X 10.3_beta, I think
<Max-P>	I'm pretty sure someone somwhere patched it so it does run in a VM
<pingfloyd>	apple doesn't want you running os x in a vm
<reisio>	sure they do
<reisio>	as long as you pay extra for the privilege they don't mind
<pingfloyd>	well that's true
<reisio>	mostly they'd prefer you to buy cardigans, though
<reisio>	luckily there's no simple way to tell if someone asking about Mac OS in a VM has paid extra or not :p
<GreeningGalaxy>	reisio: what should dpkg -l | grep -i ucode have returned, ideally?
<pingfloyd>	iirc, it's against their standard eula
<reisio>	GreeningGalaxy: well _ideally_, a hot naked woman
<reisio>	or man if you like menses
<GreeningGalaxy>	.....
<reisio>	yeah you have to buy the server version
<pingfloyd>	but I'm no iFan so there's a good chance I'm wrong about that one.
<GreeningGalaxy>	it didn't return anything on my netbook either.
<reisio>	pingfloyd: you're right, there's just more to it
<GreeningGalaxy>	er, that is, the netbook running xubuntu where everything works.
<pingfloyd>	reisio: so extra license required?
<reisio>	GreeningGalaxy: ucode is a thing for giving you that solution is all, was curious if that was the specific item giving it to you
<reisio>	pingfloyd: extra/different/something
<reisio>	it probably costs a lot more
<pid1>	I forgot that the server version can run in a VM.
<GreeningGalaxy>	reisio: huh. i'm not finding that in either Debian's or Ubuntu's repos.
<reisio>	they can all run in a vm
<reisio>	the server one can do it 100% legally :p
<pid1>	I just didn't realize any of them could.
<reisio>	GreeningGalaxy: on gitorious I think
<pid1>	How do they do activation/prevention?
<reisio>	pid1: sure, just another BSD, really
<reisio>	pid1: about as well/poorly as any other software
<reisio>	which is not very well
<reisio>	people using your software and not yet paying for it is better than them not using it
<pingfloyd>	that's how OpenBSD looks at it
<reisio>	put another way: people don't steal what isn't desirable
<GreeningGalaxy>	reisio: ....DRM refactoring for an AMD CPU? are you sure it's called ucode?
<reisio>	I mean they do, just not nearly as much :)
<pingfloyd>	they'd rather everyone do use their software instead of reinventing a less secure wheel
<reisio>	GreeningGalaxy: https://gitorious.org/ucode/ucode/
<reisio>	pingfloyd: everyone does, just not their OS, heh
<GreeningGalaxy>	ah! thanks
<reisio>	OpenBSD is my favorite BSD easily
<pid1>	Heh. All of these search results for running OSX in a VM are not exactly on the up-and-up.
<reisio>	but it's a BSD, so it's behind
<pid1>	I'm glad I don't have to mess with that nonsense.
*	AMERICA__ is now known as AMERICAN_PSYCHO
*	AMERICAN_PSYCHO is now known as AMERICA__
<FreezingCold>	Any ideas for a low-power router?
<SineDeviance>	hey guys, question ... is there any way to remove all files of *.filetype while ALSO removing the directory they are in recursively?
*	chris0626891 is now known as chris062689
<SineDeviance>	basically, i am trying to clean my media collection and i want to delete everything that isn't 720p or higher
<FreezingCold>	I'm almost tempted to buy a z3735f tablet for like $100 lol.
<SineDeviance>	specifically all the crappy divx AVIs from 7 years ago. lol.
<EriC^^>	SineDeviance: do the dirs that contain the filetypes only have those?
<GreeningGalaxy>	reisio: it's not compiling. :/
<SineDeviance>	EriC^^: some will have .srt for subtitles, and maybe some .nfo files
<GreeningGalaxy>	I've made sure I have the packages it mentions
<GreeningGalaxy>	"ucode.c:27:17: fatal error: xdo.h: No such file or directory"
<SineDeviance>	i can settle for just keeping the MKVs and MP4s
<EriC^^>	SineDeviance: so you're sure you want to delete the whole dir if they are in one?
<FreezingCold>	http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Ployer-MOMO8W-Windows-8-1-Tablet-8-inch-IPS-1280x800-screen-1GB-16GB-Dual-camera-Bluetooth/32309300858.html
<pid1>	This is probably a stupid solution, but recursively .rm the files, and then delete any empty directories.
<FreezingCold>	I'm tempted to buy that to use as a router lol.
<SineDeviance>	EriC^^: yep.
<pid1>	Assuming the directories are empty after the files you don't want are removed.
<SineDeviance>	pid1: not all directories will be empty, and i have approx. 300 movies in AVI format alone
<SineDeviance>	it'd take hours to do it manually
<Max-P>	That's probably rather easy in bash with some kind of recursive function
<pid1>	SineDeviance, But....
<pid1>	You said you wanted to delete the directory they are in.
<pingfloyd>	GreeningGalaxy: apt-file search xdo.h, to figure out the package you're missing
<SineDeviance>	pid1: each movie is in it's own directory
<SineDeviance>	does that make sense?
<SineDeviance>	i.e. /movies/Movie 1, /moves/Movie 2, etc
<pingfloyd>	but you shouldn't need to -dev packages for compiling
<SineDeviance>	i want to run a script in the /movies directory that will remove all .avi's and the folders they were in
<pid1>	That I got.
<pingfloyd>	in this case it's libxdo-dev that you're missing
<pid1>	But you followed that up by saying that Movie1 won't be empty after you remove the files
<rascul>	you're empty
*	rascul refills pid1
*	pid1 looks longingly into the distance as he contemplates the value of the coffee he's filled with...
<GreeningGalaxy>	pingfloyd: okay thanks!
<Max-P>	SineDeviance, Maybe something in those lines (WARNING: UNTESTED) find movies/ -name "*.avi" -exec rm {} \; -exec rmdir \$(dirname {} ) \;
<SineDeviance>	pid1: if i just recursively delete all *.avi for example, the directories will be left over with .nfo and .srt files but i don't want those
<pid1>	Oh, ok
<pid1>	just chain things
<pid1>	delete all .avi, .nfl, .srt files at once
<EriC^^>	SineDeviance: find . -iname "*.filetype" | while read i; do echo rm -r $(dirname "$i"); done
<pid1>	then find ~/Movies/ -empty -type d -delete
<pingfloyd>	of course that assumes empty directories
<SineDeviance>	pid1: but SOME folders have HD movies with the same extra files that i DO want to kep
<SineDeviance>	keep*
<pingfloyd>	to clean up the directories, but is a good option as it is safer
<EriC^^>	SineDeviance: if you're happy with it remove the echo part
<GreeningGalaxy>	ugh. xdo-type isn't working, presumably because my xdotool is too new. D:<
<pid1>	SineDeviance, What do you mean by "same extra files"
<SineDeviance>	i ONLY want to delete the directories with the avi's
<SineDeviance>	pid1: i mean that some movies are MP4 or MKV, and also have .srt (for subtitles)
<pid1>	OH
<SineDeviance>	so i don't want to delete ALL .srt :D
<pid1>	Just delete all directories containing .avi files.
<Max-P>	Yep, EriC^^ pretty much have the right solution
<pid1>	and clean recursively.
<SineDeviance>	pid1: yes, but how!?
<pid1>	See EriC^^
<Froolap>	SineDeviance: make a backup of everything so you have a second chance.
<SineDeviance>	oh ... yeah, can't make a backup. it's 200 gigs of movies and my drive is full. that's why i'm trying to prune all the non-HD stuff :D
<pingfloyd>	always do a dry-run first
<pid1>	Yup
<pid1>	create junk files in a junk directory
<pingfloyd>	surprises happen
<SineDeviance>	okay, i'll give that a shot :D
<SineDeviance>	thanks guys
<Max-P>	Yeah, there's a "echo" in the command to test it out. Review the output, if everything's right remove the echo and run it for real
<Froolap>	SineDeviance: you could do a fancy ls -r and turn it into a script to create the directories and touch filenames so that you have a place to test your purge script before trying to delete actual data.
<SineDeviance>	Max-P: will do :D let's see if this works
<pingfloyd>	for that type of test it would be easier to copy a portion of the tree to /tmp and run it on that
<pingfloyd>	or copy into some scratch directory
<Froolap>	a bunch of directories and 0 byte files shouldn't eat much drive space. but would give a decent idea if the script does what you want.
<pingfloyd>	depends where you want the work done in creating the test structure.  More work on your part, or more work on the computer's part.
<EriC^^>	didn't cp have a copy dir structure option?
<pingfloyd>	there's cp -a
<pingfloyd>	will basically is like cloning it more or less (see manpage for details).
<reisio>	it's like rsync, only not as good :D
<EriC^^>	i remember seeing something about cp only copying the dirs, i can't find it in the manual though
<EriC^^>	it ignores the files though, just copies the dir structure
<reisio>	right, hence cp -r, etc.
<reisio>	if you're serious about copying, use rsync
<kerframil>	cp doesn't skip files
<Froolap>	uppppp
<Froolap>	cp --attributes-only???? doesn't copy file data, just the attributes?  dunno, never used it.
<pingfloyd>	wrong flag
<pingfloyd>	see --archive
<reisio>	zzzz
<EriC^^>	nah, it was something else, i read it somewhere maybe it's deprecated or the info was wrong
<reisio>	EriC^^: just try it
<pingfloyd>	the info is wrong
<Froolap>	On my manpage it was showing both -a for archive as well as --attributes-only
<reisio>	EriC^^: mkdir a; cp a b
<reisio>	just try it ffs holy potato :p
<pingfloyd>	plain and simple, it was probably written by someone that didn't understand cp
<SineDeviance>	okay, so it doesn't work with folders that have spaces in the name
<SineDeviance>	EriC^^'s script
<reisio>	SineDeviance: what is it you wanted, again?
<EriC^^>	reisio: i'm talking about cp having an option that only copies the dir structure and no files
<SineDeviance>	reisio: i want to delete any directories that have a .avi file inside them, to be basic
<pingfloyd>	SineDeviance: did you not quote the $i?
<SineDeviance>	but NOT any directories that have a .mp4 or .mkv
<reisio>	EriC^^: there are things or that, but I never did quite see the point
<SineDeviance>	pid1: i did
<reisio>	SineDeviance: why?
<SineDeviance>	find . -iname "*.avi" | while read i; do rm -r $(dirname "$i"); done
<SineDeviance>	reisio: trying to clean out my media
<SineDeviance>	remove anything not HD
<pingfloyd>	those quotes in $(dirname "$i") are important
<SineDeviance>	etc
<SineDeviance>	pingfloyd: i know, they're in the command
<EriC^^>	SineDeviance: are you sure you used "$i" ?
<kerframil>	*all* expansions should be quoted. hence, "$(dirname "$i")"
<SineDeviance>	EriC^^: i copied and pasted exactly what you put
<SineDeviance>	let me pastebin
<ananke>	SineDeviance: uhmm, why bother removing the directories? seems like the complex logic of your request is resulting in an overly fragile solution
<annihilannic>	EriC^^: find with cpio works well for that.
<SineDeviance>	ananke: because i don't want a bunch of empty movie folders laying around
<ananke>	SineDeviance: break it down into two steps: 1) find /dir -iname '*.avi' -delete  2) remove empty directories
<reisio>	yeah, Max-P's original is probably the sanest approach
<ananke>	find . -type d -empty
<EriC^^>	SineDeviance: sorry, quote the whole thing
<EriC^^>	SineDeviance: find . -iname "*.filetype" | while read i; do echo rm -r "$(dirname "$i")"; done
<kerframil>	SineDeviance: I can think of an alternate approach. just giv e me a second to whip it up.
<ananke>	SineDeviance: step 2): find . -type d -empty -exec rmdir {} \;
<SineDeviance>	ahh EriC^^, thanks
<pingfloyd>	I'd do the 2 step approach
<loganlee>	hello my friends
<reisio>	nothing wrong with one
<ananke>	EriC^^: uhmm, that's going to remove directories with other files in them
<SineDeviance>	ananke: that doesn't work, because not all directories will be empty
<reisio>	but deleting the file and then rmdir is nice
<pingfloyd>	safer
<EriC^^>	2 steps is nice, but he has other files in the dir too
<SineDeviance>	ananke: some of the .avi's have .srt and .nfo files with them
<kerframil>	SineDeviance: what's the parent directory (beneath which avi files may exist)?
<ananke>	SineDeviance: exactly. you don't want to remove non-empty dirs
<pingfloyd>	the safety of rmdir
<Max-P>	reisio, Yeah no. rsync command execution is a bit terrible. The find pipe from EriC^^ is better and a lot more flexible
<SineDeviance>	ananke: yes, i do
<ananke>	SineDeviance: then remove those files in step #1
<EriC^^>	ananke: the dirs have the .avi and other stuff too like .nfo
<SineDeviance>	i want to remove ANY directory that has a .avi in it
<grublet>	is there any simple way to convert a .json list of bookmarks to plaintext titles/urls?
<SineDeviance>	because the extra files are only related to that copy of the moviue
<SineDeviance>	movie*
<ananke>	EriC^^: but if there's .mkv file in such directory, it will get blown away
<SineDeviance>	ananke: each movie and it's loose files are in their own directory
<ananke>	SineDeviance: then why mention: 19:31  SineDeviance> but NOT any directories that have a .mp4 or .mkv
<EriC^^>	ananke: i asked him first question
<EriC^^>	SineDeviance: so you're sure you want to delete the whole dir if they are in one?
<EriC^^>	actually twice
<reisio>	Max-P: dunno what you guys were talking about, was only a comment on 'cp' vs 'rsync'
<pingfloyd>	I don't think SineDeviance has it fully realized what kind of program behavior he needs
<SineDeviance>	ananke: because the mp4 and mkv directories also have .srt and .nfo files in some of them, thus a rm "*.nfo" won't work
<EriC^^>	he said if it has any match, then he's sure he wants it gone, and nothing else in the dir mattered
<SineDeviance>	does that make sense?
<SineDeviance>	pingfloyd: uh yeah, i have, you guys just don't seem to be listening to what i'm telling you. lol.
<EriC^^>	SineDeviance: if .avi is in one, is there any chance a .mp4 or .mkv will be in the dir too?
<SineDeviance>	EriC^^: no
<reisio>	SineDeviance: you've been given about a thousand solutions by now :p
<SineDeviance>	again, EVERY MOVIE IS IN IT'S OWN DIRECTORY!
<kerframil>	SineDeviance: so, just to be clear, the presence of at least one *.avi file is due cause to blow the containing directory away? no exceptions?
<EriC^^>	ok, that's what you answered earlier
<SineDeviance>	i only want to remove the directories THAT HAVE AN AVI
<ananke>	by now he could have just tried any of them
<SineDeviance>	does that make sense?
<reisio>	SineDeviance: made sense the first few hundred times people gave you an answer
<SineDeviance>	kerframil: yep
<pingfloyd>	and had one honed for his needs
<pid1>	SineDeviance, Your question was not very clear in the beginning, which made it hard to propose a solution.
<pid1>	We had to clarify which directories you wanted removed.
<kerframil>	SineDeviance: ( shopt -s nullglob; find /movies -type d -print0 | while read -r -d '' dir; do files=("$dir"/*.avi); (( ${#files[@]} )) && echo rm -rf "$dir"; done )
<pid1>	Lay off the caps lock
<SineDeviance>	pid1: "I'd like to remove all AVIs and the directories they are inside"
<SineDeviance>	how is that not clear?
<kerframil>	SineDeviance: change /movies to whatever is appropriate and remove the echo if the results look good
<ananke>	SineDeviance: now you should be doing it, instead of arguing
<pingfloyd>	the solution for that was already provided along with a correction to it
<SineDeviance>	EriC^^: adding the quotes around the entire command helped, thank you!
<SineDeviance>	it works
<reisio>	many solutions
<reisio>	copying & pasting is a real skill
<pingfloyd>	who the one not reading?
<pid1>	SineDeviance, "<SineDeviance> pid1: not all directories will be empty, and i have approx. 300 movies in AVI format alone"
<SineDeviance>	pingfloyd: yet people kept telling me to do this way, not that way, etc etc
<SineDeviance>	and arguing about whether i know what i need
<SineDeviance>	it's like, seriously?
<pingfloyd>	you can choose whatever suggestion you want
<SineDeviance>	pingfloyd: or i could just choose the right one?:
<pid1>	You should ask for a refund on your free tech support
<pid1>	Oh, wait...
<pingfloyd>	but the unwritten rule of sense is that you never type in anything you don't understand what it does
<Froolap>	SineDeviance: It's not our data, we won't be the ones crying if it's wrong and you want to falt people for trying to protect what you value?
<reisio>	pingfloyd: you're no fun :p
<ananke>	'bastards proposed me a safe method. ohh the travesty'
<SineDeviance>	EriC^^: it worked perfectly, thanks! just clearned 280 gigs in about ten seconds :D
<SineDeviance>	cleared*
<pingfloyd>	there's even been suggestion of how to test it first too, which is above and beyond.
<ananke>	of course, the premise that AVIs can't hold HD content is already flawed
<SineDeviance>	pingfloyd: and i DID test it, but after removing echo it broke the command because the quotes were missing
<SineDeviance>	ananke: all of my AVIs are standard-def, i confirmed this with XBMC
<kerframil>	SineDeviance: there are various other conditions that could have broken the command (albeit more rare than files containing spaces)
<SineDeviance>	well, were. they're gone now
<pingfloyd>	My script would be more careful, because I expect the unexpected.
<pingfloyd>	if I felt really worried, I'd put in some checking routines
<EriC^^>	to be fair i think yes he got off pretty easily
<SineDeviance>	EriC^^: you wrote a good command. thanks :D
<EriC^^>	but another method would have the same aspects of danger
<ananke>	using mv instead of rm is an ok method for avoiding disasters
<SineDeviance>	ananke: i don't have the space
<kerframil>	SineDeviance: mine was safe ... almost. I should have written rm -rf -- "$file" to prevent files beginning with a hypen from being treated a switches.
<SineDeviance>	thus the cleanup
<ananke>	SineDeviance: 'mv' doesn't require additional space
<SineDeviance>	then why mv them?
<pid1>	?
<ananke>	SineDeviance: so you can perform a final inspection
<Froolap>	because mv isn't destructive
<SineDeviance>	ananke: but i don't know which folders have .avi and which dont
*	annihilannic facepalms
<SineDeviance>	it would have taken hours to go through the list, i have over 1,000 movies man
*	ananke is facepalming with annihilannic 
<EriC^^>	you could run a find for .mp4 on the moved files
<pingfloyd>	yeah, you could mv them to /tmp and depending on your distro, they'll get cleaned on their own
<ananke>	SineDeviance: it wouldn't. you'd simply have a tree of directories with files in them. it's trivial to then list all the files in that location that are not AVIs/whatever
<ananke>	but it would allow you to safely recover data if something went wrong
<SineDeviance>	ananke: ah, i see what you mean
<GreeningGalaxy>	I think I've managed to make my question slightly simpler:
<GreeningGalaxy>	if I run an application with GTK_IM_MODULE=gtk-im-context-simple, I can enter unicode characters just fine in that application.
<GreeningGalaxy>	However, exporting that variable does not make that work for all subsequently opened applications
<GreeningGalaxy>	what am I doing wring?
<ananke>	it's like separating liquids over the sink. sure. you could do it over the toilet if you feel lucky
<annihilannic>	GreeningGalaxy: exporting it where?  it needs to be exported in the parent process that launches those applications
<pingfloyd>	GreeningGalaxy: iirc, I think you have to pass those to your DM
<GreeningGalaxy>	hrm, okay
<GreeningGalaxy>	ah
<annihilannic>	GreeningGalaxy: so probably in your window manager startup script or similar, .xinitrc?
<awkwardtechdude>	I've been trying to learn Python, so I tried making  a game. I'm working on a game called PyAdv. It's a text adventure game, like "Zork".  It's got two branches (It's on GitHub.), one called master, with code I deem releaseworthy, and one called dev, with buggy testing code. It'd really help if anyone could give it a look and tell about any bugs, or, more importantly, how I can do more with less code.
<pingfloyd>	or put in your .xinitrc
<GreeningGalaxy>	maybe? I'll look.
<pingfloyd>	if you're not using a dm
<pingfloyd>	so check your DMs documentation and see how you can give it environment variables
<GreeningGalaxy>	um, i don't have an .xinitrc
<GreeningGalaxy>	ok
<ananke>	awkwardtechdude: uhmm, visit #python
<pingfloyd>	what dm are you using?
<GreeningGalaxy>	gdm
<GreeningGalaxy>	i have that in my .bashrc, shouldn't that make it work??
<pingfloyd>	no
<awkwardtechdude>	ananke: good idea
<pingfloyd>	.bashrc is for your user in shell sessions
<GlenK>	my dm is dave graffum!
<GreeningGalaxy>	putting it in /etc/profile and/or /etc/environment seemed to make it work in GNOME
<pingfloyd>	GreeningGalaxy: check /etc/gdm/Xsession
<GreeningGalaxy>	thanks
<GreeningGalaxy>	I have no /etc/gdm dir.
<GreeningGalaxy>	nvm, its gdm3
<GreeningGalaxy>	haha
<GreeningGalaxy>	okay, i put GTK_IM_MODULE=gtk-im-context-simple in there. should that work?
<pingfloyd>	GreeningGalaxy: also check for an xfce directory in /etc/xdg/ and see if the file is there
<GreeningGalaxy>	okay
<pingfloyd>	I don't have xfce4 installed, so unsure of the actual filename
<pingfloyd>	but check around in that hierarchy
<GreeningGalaxy>	there's an xinitrc file in that directory that looks the same as the Xsession thing for GDM
<pingfloyd>	you should also be able to copy that to ~/.config/xfce4, but before copying, see if you have it already and can just edit it.
<pingfloyd>	that's for if you want just for your user and not system-wide
<GreeningGalaxy>	alright
<GreeningGalaxy>	doesnt matter, personal laptop with only one account
<GreeningGalaxy>	even if i had multiple accounts I'd probably want this to work for all of them, lol
<pingfloyd>	the two locations have their own sets of implications to think about when deciding
<`backtick`>	is this where I'd ask about using certutil? I'm getting "SEC_ERROR_BAD_DATABASE: security library: bad database.", even without using any variables in my path
<pingfloyd>	if in doubt, make a copy of the original
<`backtick`>	from this command: certutil -d sql:/home/vagrant/.pki/nssdb -L
<GreeningGalaxy>	pingfloyd: adding one line to the bottom. for the moment I think I'll remember what to fix if it doesn't work
<pingfloyd>	your call and your consequences
<GreeningGalaxy>	yup
<GreeningGalaxy>	ok, brb.
<CHVNX>	158,000 active dial-up users in Australia
<GreeningGalaxy>	nope, no luck
<GreeningGalaxy>	does it need to be 'export VARIABLE=value' or just VARIABLE=value?
<pingfloyd>	after editing which file?
<GreeningGalaxy>	etc/xdg/xfce4/xinitrc
<GreeningGalaxy>	and /etc/gdm3/Xsession
<annihilannic>	with the 'export'
<GreeningGalaxy>	okay
<pingfloyd>	the xinitrc is probably for if you use startx instead of dm
<pingfloyd>	is there one named like the DE under /etc/xdg
<GreeningGalaxy>	okay
<GreeningGalaxy>	uh
<GreeningGalaxy>	thats what it was
<GreeningGalaxy>	 /etc/xdg/xfce4/ and then theres helpers.rc  panel  xfconf  Xft.xrdb  xinitrc
<diegoviola>	how do you guys manage your ssh-agent? it's annoying to export SSH_AUTH_SOCK every time and ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
<GreeningGalaxy>	nope. i added export to it and copied it to .config/xfce4, but it still isn't working.
<GreeningGalaxy>	envprint says the variable is set where it needs to be, but still applications refuse to work with unicode input unless I manually set the variable when running them.
<phaeton>	Hey kids, as anyone here had trouble with grub2 on old hardware?
<reisio>	wouldn't think it would matter
<reisio>	grub2 probably supports more hardware more easily
<phaeton>	Specifically it'll install fine, no error messages, but gives "unknown file system" on boot and drops to rescue
<phaeton>	reisio: yeah, you'd think
<reisio>	that sounds less to do with grub and more to do with your kernel
<reisio>	is it before or after the grub boot screen?
<phaeton>	Maybe.  I tried both grub2 and grub-legacy, finally installed lilo and it just worked
<phaeton>	before
<reisio>	so was there a point to this convo?
<reisio>	or did I just help you make a blog post
<reisio>	if something tells you it doesn't grok the filesystem, it's probably because it doesn't
<phaeton>	I was asking if anyone definitively knew that grub doesn't work with certain hardware
<reisio>	indeed, no
<phaeton>	thanks
<CHVNX>	If grub doesn't work, then don't buy it.
<CHVNX>	It's useless.
<reisio>	then don't dig it out of the ground and eat it
<Tagor>	I installed openvpn server on my rpi (which is directly connected to the internet) and want to use it with my android phone. I'm able to establish a connection with openvpn but cannot access the internet. DNS doesn't work and I can't ping any ip address. Anyone got an idea what's wrong? This is my config: http://pastebin.com/UvTj6j6h
<pingfloyd>	phaeton: inevitably it doesn't work with something, nothing just works with everything

<CHVNX>	dasabhi: Get a blog or ask your question.
<dasabhi>	but see the thing is i need the pi to boot that python script immediately as i boot the pi
<ayecee>	BlaDe^: eh, you could try using gparted on the live system, maybe it'll work. it'll at least tell you if it won't.
<ayecee>	BlaDe^: come to think of it, growing a filesystem online might work, it's the shrinking that's kind of dicey.
<reisio>	dasabhi: rc.local
<CHVNX>	dasabhi: Are you asking how to launch a python script at boot?
<reisio>	as foreseen, the arduino bit was irrelevant
<dasabhi>	yes yes thats it
<dasabhi>	how do i get the pi to launch a python script at boot?
<reisio>	already said
<BlaDe^>	ayecee: actually, it looks like there is a way to do it after taking the vps offline: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/storage_expand_partition.html
<CHVNX>	dasabhi: http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Launch-Python-script-on-startup/
<ayecee>	dasabhi: launch it from /etc/rc.d/rc.local
<BlaDe^>	ayecee:  oh... how might i grow it online?
<reisio>	egrow.com
<BlaDe^>	ayecee:  I thought i'd had this problem before, and I thought I used resize2fs to solve it, but i could be mistaken
<ayecee>	BlaDe^: like i said, you could install gparted and try doing it that way.
<BlaDe^>	ayecee:  ah to grow ti also?
<ayecee>	BlaDe^: you could try using resize2fs directly, but that takes a lot more attention to detail and it's easier to break things.
<BlaDe^>	ayecee:  i'm going to follow this, i'm assuming parted and gparted ar ethe same? http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/storage_expand_partition.html#expanding-partition-parted
<ayecee>	BlaDe^: gparted is graphical, but they do mostly the same thing.
<BlaDe^>	gotcha
<BlaDe^>	I fear that it will say disk is busy or something, because this is my boot disk
<pingfloyd>	just follow the directions
<dasabhi>	guys does the rpi have a native pwm function ? or does one have to manually code a pwm wave with delay functions?
<CHVNX>	RTFM and sacrifice a GNU on the alter of Stallman, and everything will be fine.
<ayecee>	dasabhi: it sounds like something you should ask in a rpi channel.
<dasabhi>	good point =|
<CHVNX>	dasabhi: https://pythonhosted.org/RPIO/pwm_py.html
<soidexe>	hi there! I have a question about memory mapped files. Not sure it's the right channel though. I would like to troubleshoot what portion of memory mapped file is loaded into memory. Are there any ways of doing it in linux?
<ayecee>	soidexe: to what end?
<soidexe>	ayecee: sorry what do you mean?
<ayecee>	soidexe: what are you trying to do where this information would be useful?
<soidexe>	ayecee: I'm trying to measure performance of my application when memory mapped file is not fully loaded in memory
<BlaDe^>	ayecee:  resize2fs gives: The filesystem is already 2096128 (4k) blocks long.  Nothing to do!
<BlaDe^>	i guess that's expected? the lsblk is @ http://pastie.org/pastes/10164885/text?key=po5ysxbib8cvxrzmnqkqa
<ayecee>	soidexe: ok, would it be enough to just flush it?
<ayecee>	BlaDe^: you'd have to resize the partition before you resize the filesystem.
<jeffreylevesque>	xangua: i do like hot spices
<ayecee>	soidexe: err, not flush it, but to purge the loaded parts from memory?
<soidexe>	ayecee: sounds interesting to try
<soidexe>	how is it possible?
<ayecee>	soidexe: that's a good question. i think you could do it with "echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches", but i'm not sure if that affects mmap'ed pages.
<soidexe>	I'm curious about `pmap -x` output, it has the following columns "Address Kbytes RSS Dirty Mode   Mapping". I'm curious if RSS means how much of it loaded in residential memory
<ayecee>	soidexe: that sounds reasonable
<kerframil>	ayecee: I think that 1 should be enough, covering pagecache
<ayecee>	like, echo 1? sure, could be
<soidexe>	ayecee: do you know what the "Dirty" column might mean?
<ayecee>	soidexe: pages which have been modified but not yet sent to disk.
<soidexe>	trying to write in /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches shows "Permission denied" under root
<soidexe>	oh makes sense
<Gaming4JC>	Hi guys, simple question regarding pipes - I am trying to use  "2>&1 debug.txt" to log all terminal output of a crashing program. Why isn't it working?
<ayecee>	soidexe: you're using sudo, i bet.
<MetaNova>	soidexe: real machine or VPS?
<Gaming4JC>	e.g. --> blah.sh  2>&1 debug.txt
<ayecee>	soidexe: see if it works if you use "sudo -s" first.
<soidexe>	Gaming4JC:  "2>&1 >debug.txt"
<Gaming4JC>	soidexe: Thanks! Was missing that second >
<ayecee>	Gaming4JC: blah.sh >debug.txt 2>&1
<Gaming4JC>	ok
<ayecee>	the order is important
<soidexe>	ayecee: nope
<ayecee>	soidexe: yup
<Gaming4JC>	I always forget the order
<Gaming4JC>	my bad.
<Gaming4JC>	:)
*	Gaming4JC makes a note
<Gaming4JC>	:p
<soidexe>	why the order is important?
*	kerframil throws in another yup
<Gaming4JC>	good question
<Gaming4JC>	some bash wizardry needed to explain
<ayecee>	soidexe: in your line, 2>&1 redirects fd2 to stdout, and redirects fd1 to the file. so, fd2 will still go to stdout.
<kerframil>	Gaming4JC: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls (pitfall #43)
<Limun_obr>	hi
<Limun_obr>	ayecee
<soidexe>	ayecee: I think it shows 'perm denied' because i'm working in a container: http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/109496/echo-3-proc-sys-vm-drop-caches-permission-denied-as-root
<Limun_obr>	:)
<ayecee>	Limun_obr: there you go.
<Gaming4JC>	kerfamil: Thank you :)
<ayecee>	soidexe: ah, that would do it.
<Limun_obr>	please hel me :(
<Limun_obr>	prodtpd not start debian 8
<ayecee>	Limun_obr: type slower, and explain the problem you're having.
<Gaming4JC>	presumably he's trying to setup proftpd service on debian
<Gaming4JC>	systemctl status proftpd (since they switched to systemctl) should provide the reason
<ayecee>	Limun_obr: alright, Gaming4JC's going to help you with this one.
*	ayecee throws Gaming4JC under the bus
<Gaming4JC>	lol.
<Limun_obr>	I found the tutorial I used to instalattion proftpd , however, does not want to start service proftpd start

<ayecee>	"unknown configuration directive"
<Gaming4JC>	[1767]: fatal: unknown configuration directive
<Gaming4JC>	ayecee beat me to it
<Gaming4JC>	xD

<ayecee>	annihilannic: i wondered about that too, and yup, it's a directive.
<BlaDe^>	any ideas why it only lets me create a 1mb parittion? :S
<ayecee>	BlaDe^: nope, don't know
<annihilannic>	ayecee: I vaguely recall "STOR" is a raw FTP command... makes sense
<BlaDe^>	i can't figure out how to resize, i guess i'll just make a new one and mount that
<Limun_obr>	ayecee, Gaming4JC I copied the defualt with your link but again the same probelm
<Gaming4JC>	hmm
<Limun_obr>	Gaming4JC, http://paste.debian.net/171784/
<Gaming4JC>	different error

<Limun_obr>	what to do now , I'm sorry I 'm boring
<Gaming4JC>	Limun_obr: do you have group?
<kerframil>	BlaDe^: have it start at, say, 16773120 instead
<Gaming4JC>	the one from previous config, or you need to make one

<Limun_obr>	lol
<ayecee>	Limun_obr: it looks like you edited /etc/host.conf when you should have edited /etc/hosts
<ayecee>	Limun_obr: remove the line you added to /etc/host.conf and put it in /etc/hosts where it belongs.
<BlaDe^>	kerframil:  ah ok thank you!
<Limun_obr>	I have run proftpd :)
<Limun_obr>	yea beybe madafaca :)
<Gaming4JC>	I assume you fixed it?
<Gaming4JC>	:p
<Gaming4JC>	keep in mind proftpd improperly configured is dangerous. (obviously don't run as user with admin rights, and restrict it to it's own home directory, etc.)
<Limun_obr>	thanks Gaming4JC

<Gaming4JC>	ah..
<Limun_obr>	how to set up , GamePanel creates FTP account , but with the order I'm going to the root files
<gaaara>	is a video with  flash drm it works with Gnash ?
<Limun_obr>	Gaming4JC
<Gaming4JC>	gaara: Pretty sure that error is built into the closed-source Adobe only. Gnash plays some videos, not all - worth a try. :)
<Psi-Jack>	gaaara: No
<Gaming4JC>	DRM = horrible.
<Gaming4JC>	:p
<Limun_obr>	to limit that srv_1_1 FTP account has access to only those files
<Gaming4JC>	Limun_obr: Best option is to make new user/group only for  srv_1_1
<Gaming4JC>	Limun_obr: Then inside their home directory, install needed files
<Gaming4JC>	as users, they won't be able to access others homes
<Gaming4JC>	e.g. the rest of your computer.
<gaaara>	yes is orrible arrr stupid drm  .....
<Gaming4JC>	gaara: Doesn't hurt to write the website and complain to them. Sometimes it helps :D
<Limun_obr>	GamePanel install New Folder makes the FTP account , or when you make that right of access to the root
<Gaming4JC>	Limun_obr: You should never FTP as root users :s
<Gaming4JC>	Limun_obr: See if GamePanel (?) is able to use another user
<gaaara>	I tried to say they do not support linux
<Gaming4JC>	Limun_obr: You can use "adduser" to create new username/password to try
<Gaming4JC>	Limun_obr: Then in your proftpd settings, use that username/group instead of root
<Gaming4JC>	:)
<Limun_obr>	But I want the user to be made ​​to have rights in that directory for which he did , to me, FTP account name and folders to Home
<Gaming4JC>	Limun_obr: If you want you can great the new user access to other directories, it's never a good idea to grant a root account FTP access for security reasons
<Gaming4JC>	create* a new user
<Limun_obr>	Well, I think I do not want to , because I'm asking you how to adjust to
<andrew39>	my X crashes randomly at very odd times when switching between ttys... any thoughts as to what could cause that
<Gaming4JC>	Limun_obr: How to adjust...?
<Limun_obr>	yes :)
<Gaming4JC>	andrew39: check dmesg / Xorg logs, might be something useful there
<Gaming4JC>	Limun_obr: Tell what you would like to adjust with more detail please :)
<Limun_obr>	When GamePanel creates server to copy the new folder that is called srv_1 creates srv_1 ftp account , that account has the right of access to the base, I want it to ban
<Limun_obr>	I want to ban that srv_1 entitled to access root files , also create other server when he srv_2 disable FTP account srv_2 to have access root files but only this folder

<Psi-Jack>	andrew39: Likely.. Unstable video drivers/.

<Limun_obr>	yes
<Limun_obr>	automatic create ftp account

<Limun_obr>	The gun and kill it :)
<Gaming4JC>	Limun_obr: There's several ways to do this. Looks like the easiest is rbash
<Gaming4JC>	http://www.tecmint.com/rbash-a-restricted-bash-shell-explained-with-practical-examples/
<Gaming4JC>	once you have restricted bash
<Limun_obr>	To do this I think it will work?
<Gaming4JC>	you can modify the /etc/shell of srv_1
<Gaming4JC>	yes --> http://blog.bodhizazen.net/linux/how-to-restrict-access-with-rbash/
<Gaming4JC>	ruser can = srv_1
<Gaming4JC>	:)
<Limun_obr>	Do you always have to change for each user's FTP ?
<Limun_obr>	srv_2?
<Gaming4JC>	yes :/
<Limun_obr>	:(
<Gaming4JC>	this "gamepanel" should do this by default. You should write to them and complain
<Gaming4JC>	xD
<Gaming4JC>	they could make some scripts to do it for you
<Gaming4JC>	Limun_obr: Since "GamePanel" is creating users, I think this is a security flaw. Imagine if it used rbash by default
<Gaming4JC>	:p
<Gaming4JC>	much better

<malaprop>	Gaming4JC: udev, systemd, ...
<Gaming4JC>	distro*
<Gaming4JC>	so yes it comes with a basic shell
<Gaming4JC>	there's always Gentoo / LFS
<storge>	the best thing about arch is how much you have to care and feed for it.
<Gaming4JC>	:p
<malaprop>	Gaming4JC: all static libraries stripped by default, so dll hell is built in
<malaprop>	Gaming4JC: Arch comes with a lot
<Limun_obr>	Game 'll change panel Do you think you do not need anything in proftpd.conf be adjusted
<storge>	malaprop: ssssh, it's pure.
<Limun_obr>	Gaming4JC
<Psi-Jack>	malaprop: Ironically, Fedora and Debian both have twice to three times the number of pre-built packages. :p
<Gaming4JC>	Limun_obr: If possible I would uncomment DefaultRoot ~ (for security)
<Gaming4JC>	Limun_obr: All else is good :)
<storge>	personally i think if you want something ubuntu-ish that's better than ubuntu, use its progenitor, debian.
<storge>	swim upstream
<malaprop>	Psi-Jack: Point being?
<Gaming4JC>	Psi-Jack: Yes. Ubuntu has 20 times the amount in Debian, and even Debian has tons of stuff.
<Limun_obr>	Gaming4JC: #DefaultRoot ~ my proftpd.conf
<storge>	ubuntu does certainly not have '20 times the amount in debian'
<Limun_obr>	is ok?
<Gaming4JC>	Limun_obr: Yes that line. Remove the "#"
<Limun_obr>	or not?
<storge>	and you can install debian netinstall with like a 300M footprint.
<Psi-Jack>	malaprop: Number of packages is meaningless. What's the overall quality of the distribution? How well is it maintained? How well does the upgrade path itself work? How maintainable is it without turning into a messy nightmare?
<Gaming4JC>	Limun_obr: That makes it so that users can't access root folders
<Gaming4JC>	(somewhat)
<malaprop>	Psi-Jack: Agreed
<Limun_obr>	yea :)
<Limun_obr>	<3
<Psi-Jack>	Gaming4JC: Ubuntu does not have 20 times the amount of Debian. 95% of Ubuntu packages COME from Debian.
<storge>	Psi-Jack: one thing i love about arch is how it is not found on any of my computers.
<Gaming4JC>	Psi-Jack: Run ps aux on a fresh ubuntoo box, and ps aux on a debian box
<[R]>	Psi-Jack: well if it only has 10 packages... that would be meaningful
<Loshki>	storge: :-)
<Prelude2004c>	sudo tcpdump -s 0 -A 'tcp[((tcp[12:1] & 0xf0) >> 2):4] = 0x47455420'  < this gives me the URL:// but does anyone know how to include the IP address ?
<Prelude2004c>	i know the get url but i dont know the source IP
<storge>	Gaming4JC: ps aux on ubuntu has 20 times the processes in a debian box?
<Psi-Jack>	storge: I have a nice lovely little Manjaro desktop, which is forked from Arch, but highly much more maintainable with less nightmare, while still remaining to be rolling release with a fair amount of stability.
<Gaming4JC>	storage: Based on the flood in my terminal, yes.
<storge>	Psi-Jack: now that i might try.
<storge>	Gaming4JC: perhaps something more scientific like: ps aux | wc -l
<Limun_obr>	work Gamin4JC :)
<malaprop>	Psi-Jack: How is Manjaro? I remember the #arch people exploding at the mere mention of it
<Gaming4JC>	Limun_obr: good :)
<Limun_obr>	hahah
<Limun_obr>	is king
<Limun_obr>	:)
<Loshki>	I like Ubuntu because it runs most everywhere and I can choose the distro according to how stable I want it to be vs. bleeding edge.
<Limun_obr>	I love you :)
<storge>	Loshki: use what works for you!
<Unopoo>	Hi guys, I have I mysql related problem, and I already asked in #mysql, but I think maybe here will be helpful,too
<Unopoo>	so I upgraded mysql from 5.0 to 5.5, but then I `service mysqld start` failed, and here is the mysqld.log: http://paste.linuxassist.net/view/e072b966
<Psi-Jack>	malaprop: I have been using Manjaro for ~6 months now, and really enjoy it. I switched it out from Fedora, which by itself says a LOT, because I hated Arch, and I loved Fedora. :)
<loganlee>	im back
<Gaming4JC>	malaprop: It's good, but it's like the Ubuntu of Arch, comes with tons of pre-built stuff. Some a little bloaty. Personally I like using it as a base and then scale down by removing stuff (faster than installing arch)
<Psi-Jack>	Love, still, Fedora. :)
<Limun_obr>	Another question , what is good to do everything to protect itself from DDoS attacks
<storge>	Unopoo: i don't know about your problem, but i like your nick.
<Limun_obr>	Gaming4JC
<Psi-Jack>	Limun_obr: Contact your ISP/Uplink when you detect such a thing. If you have your own BGP, understand how to null-route.
<storge>	is there something wrong with pre-built stuff?
<Loshki>	Unopoo: dunno the first thing about it, but try this: [ERROR] Can't open the mysql.plugin table. Please run mysql_upgrade to create it.
<malaprop>	Gaming4JC: Interesting
<Psi-Jack>	Gaming4JC: 100% of Arch is "Pre-Built Stuff"
<Psi-Jack>	BOOM!
<Gaming4JC>	yes, pre-built, not pre-installed
<Gaming4JC>	in terms of desktop environments anyway
<storge>	...
<Psi-Jack>	Heh
<loganlee>	i find ubuntu is the best distrob but maybe my experiences are limited
<storge>	Gaming4JC: I read once that 3 out of 4 people make up 75% of the population. true fact.
<Gaming4JC>	cool.
<malaprop>	Psi-Jack: If we take '100% of Arch' to mean the Arch philosophy, "pre-built stuff" is correct
<Unopoo>	Loshki: tried and failed:
<Unopoo>	Looking for 'mysql' as: mysql
<Unopoo>	Looking for 'mysqlcheck' as: mysqlcheck
<Unopoo>	FATAL ERROR: Upgrade failed
<Psi-Jack>	Manjaro basically comes with a great installer including the ability to do full-disk encryption, which is nice. And your choice of DE based on which download you choose, like K/X/Ubuntu, etc, or Fedora "Spins"
<Loshki>	I also read that half the population is well below average. No wonder we're in trouble. I blame the skoolz.
<Gaming4JC>	loganlee: I have a problem with Ubuntu's amazon affiliations and other schemes... Hence Stallman uses Trisquel GNU/Linux now. :)
<Psi-Jack>	Unopoo: That's nice.
<Prelude2004c>	anyone?
<Prelude2004c>	can anyone help ?
<storge>	Loshki: except in Lake Wobegone, where all the children are above average.
<Unopoo>	Psi-Jack: what's nice?
<Loshki>	storge: :-)
<Psi-Jack>	Prelude2004c: Nobody is going to help you with your shady possibly illegal stuff.
<Psi-Jack>	Unopoo: Your lack of useful information to which you need help with, with no story behind it.
<Gaming4JC>	Prelude2004c: true this. It's also fairly easy to do, use DuckDuckGo on the command you gave gives the rest of the command :P
<Prelude2004c>	duckduckgo ?
<Psi-Jack>	Do you live under a rock or something?
<loganlee>	i find ubuntu is the best distrob but maybe my experiences are limited
<Gaming4JC>	Prelude2004c: Also a tip: tcpdump cannot filter based upon the content of the packets (no deep packet inspection) as it only uses pcacp-filter.
<Psi-Jack>	loganlee: They are highly limited. :)
<Prelude2004c>	um.. so realy i want to moniter traffic and get a the full URL outputs of all the .png fies for example
<Loshki>	loganlee: 'best' is a forbidden topic. Generally leads to more heat than light.
<Prelude2004c>	what's the best way to do that ?
<Psi-Jack>	Prelude2004c: Again, you will get no help for your shady and possibly illegal activities.
<malaprop>	Loshki: well said
<Prelude2004c>	shady ?
<storge>	Prelude2004c: driftnet for images.
<Psi-Jack>	Gee, NOW you pay attention.
<Prelude2004c>	its my own net
<Psi-Jack>	Prelude2004c: That doesn't matter much.
<storge>	[root] ~ # apt-cache search driftnet
<storge>	driftnet - picks out and displays images from network traffic
<storge>	and i think you can click on the image...
<Gaming4JC>	Full Definition of SHADY 1 : producing or affording shade 2 : sheltered from the sun's rays 3 a : of questionable merit : uncertain, unreliable b : disreputable
<Psi-Jack>	Prelude2004c: Do your users known they will be monitored in such manners?
<Prelude2004c>	i am testing my own equpiment not users
<Prelude2004c>	its not for users
<storge>	Psi-Jack: of course they don't
<Prelude2004c>	i am running internal tests
<storge>	Prelude2004c: i test my lockpicking skills on nice cars too.
<Psi-Jack>	Then you don't need to use such things.
<Prelude2004c>	was simply asking if possible
<Gaming4JC>	it is
<Gaming4JC>	:p
<Prelude2004c>	since i am learning tcpdump
<malaprop>	Prelude2004c: it is, do not do it.
<Gaming4JC>	malaprop: Can we tell NSA to stop doing it?
<Gaming4JC>	o.O
<loganlee>	Psi-Jack what distro would u recommend?
<storge>	[20:01] |Prelude200 | hey guys.. anyone know a good way to listen to an interface and get  the get URL file name from user ?
<storge>	20:19] |Prelude200 | its not for users
<Psi-Jack>	loganlee: "u" isn't here to answer such questions.
<Psi-Jack>	storge++
<andrew39>	they already heard you Gaming4JC :-)
<Gaming4JC>	yay
<storge>	so it is for users, but its not for users, but its only asking if possible, because its internal, to sniff users.
<malaprop>	Gaming4JC: No need to help them
<Gaming4JC>	http://fight215.org No more Patriot Act
<Gaming4JC>	:P
*	SporkWitch is trying to figure out what's being discussed; fails
<Gaming4JC>	lol
<storge>	hey guys... anyone can tell me how to crack into computer? it's not to crack into computers, just internal testing.
<storge>	zzzzzing
<Gaming4JC>	storage: Sure bro. Google it. (Everyone trusts Google)
<Psi-Jack>	Prelude2004c: ^^ That's what you look like. :p
<Gaming4JC>	xD
<SporkWitch>	storge: all the 1337 h4x0rz are on yahoo messenger, ask there
<loganlee>	Psi-Jack what distro would you recommend
<Psi-Jack>	loganlee: Depends on the use case and purpose.
<Gaming4JC>	storage: Nah they is on AIM bro. Everyone uses AIM. #90slife
<loganlee>	oh.....
<Gaming4JC>	"You've got mail!"
<Gaming4JC>	:)
*	SporkWitch has PTSD flashbacks of the dialing noise...
<Aww>	hmm
<Gaming4JC>	lol
<malaprop>	Prelude2004c: http://catb.org/esr/writings/unix-koans/script-kiddie.html
<Psi-Jack>	SporkWitch: Obviously you know very little what PTSD is. :)
<Gaming4JC>	man those AOL CDs, they were so awesome. The sheer number of drink coasters and things you could make..
<SporkWitch>	Psi-Jack: i'm being ironic
<Psi-Jack>	Ironic is definitely not the correct word there.
<Gaming4JC>	Psi-Jack: overly emphatic?
<Psi-Jack>	That
<Psi-Jack>	... is a bit better.
<storge>	irony: it's like goldy or silvery but more iron in it.
<Gaming4JC>	xP
<SporkWitch>	in any case, no, i'm not the twit from twitter that thinks she has PTSD from getting mean messages
<storge>	who's that twit?
<Psi-Jack>	Heh.
<storge>	i want to send her a mean--i mean nice, very nice--message
<SporkWitch>	forget her name; complete idiot, went as far as contacting the COs of military members that called her on her BS (thankfully I haven't heard of any that actually got in trouble for it)
<SporkWitch>	storge: easy enough to google, though
<storge>	SporkWitch: sounds like it could be thousands of people though. the internet is full of creeps and twitter lets them howl in short blurts.
<storge>	i myself am 140 chars short of a six-pack, if you get my meaning.
<SporkWitch>	storge: was a specific case, got a decent amount of attention.  Looks like the name was Melody Hensley
<SporkWitch>	seriously though? what was going on? I scrolled the playback but can't figure out for the life of me what was being discussed lol
<SporkWitch>	(here, that is)
<pingfloyd>	PTSD
<storge>	SporkWitch: we're discussing contemporary womens' issues as they relate to linux distro selection.
<annihilannic>	sounds like a PhD title?
<SporkWitch>	storge: i know you're being sarcastic, but that is so NOT far-fetched these days >_<
<pingfloyd>	how is linux in any way related to women issues?
<SporkWitch>	pingfloyd: ask tumblr, they'll find a way lol
<storge>	The Role Of Feminism In Finite Element Analysis
<storge>	The Role Of Feminism In Computational Fluid Dynamics
<pingfloyd>	maybe they should just use linux and talk with other linux users?
<Gaming4JC>	storage: Using Twitter? You should Be Using https://quitter.se
<malaprop>	systemd will handle that soon
<malaprop>	never fear
<pingfloyd>	like gender even has anything to do with computing
<pingfloyd>	I don't understand these groups, I think they're just playing victim
<storge>	malaprop: soon the systemd will supplant that pesky linux kernel and the dictatorship that runs it
<SporkWitch>	malaprop: probably lol http://www.datenterrorist.de/grafix/systemd_monster.gif
<SporkWitch>	pingfloyd: correct
<pingfloyd>	Like I care what gender people I talk shop with are
<storge>	^ +100
<pingfloyd>	I'm just happy to have anyone in person that is on the level
<storge>	personally, i like knowing the sex of the people i chat with so i can more easily implement my Creeper Protocol.
<SporkWitch>	and thus you have one of the biggest problems with the narrative nicely encapsulated: most people, especially in technical fields, are largely meritocratic.  it's not who you are, it's what you can do
<storge>	amen.
<malaprop>	SporkWitch: Excellent!
<pingfloyd>	last place I worked it was me and a woman running the IT department.  She was probably the closest thing to a friend in the workplace.
<Gaming4JC>	Feminism? #LibertyNotHillary - #StandWithRand
<Gaming4JC>	xD
<SporkWitch>	Gaming4JC: we're diverging really far from topic, but as far as that, this is the first time in a while we've had a really good candidate: Bernie Sanders.  Whether you agree with him or not, he has one thing over literally EVERY other candidate: his voting record actually matches his rhetoric 100%
<SporkWitch>	the rest have voting records that belie their rhetoric
<AlphaOmega82>	Ron Paul 2016
<Gaming4JC>	true, it's just Bernie is wayyyyyy left on a number of issues.
<storge>	Gaming4JC: oh come on, you act like an avowed socialist is somehow left.
<Gaming4JC>	Ron Paul would be awesome, but since he's not running #StandWithRand
<pingfloyd>	clowns to the left me, jokers to the right
<SporkWitch>	Gaming4JC: he is, though most of them he's got the right idea.  on some it's not ideal, but it's unlikely to cause significant harm.
<storge>	i wouldn't mind Sanders, mainly because AFAICT he's not in the pocket of corporations, and he'd not get too much done in the socialist way if congress was against him.
<SporkWitch>	Gaming4JC: eh, see, Ron Paul goes radically right in actively harmful ways on many issues.  I want to like him, but the crazy outweighs the good
<AlphaOmega82>	I just wish the US would break out of it's two party system
<malaprop>	Poettering 2016: The Lesser Evil
<Gaming4JC>	to me Bernie Sanders is like the ideological arch enemy of Ron Paul
<Gaming4JC>	opposite but just as dramatic
<AlphaOmega82>	I always thought that was Ralph Nader
<Gaming4JC>	xD
<Psi-Jack>	This isn't ##politics, please get back on topic.
<Gaming4JC>	Psi-Jack: Quick ask us some #linux questions
<Gaming4JC>	:)
<SporkWitch>	^
<loganlee>	i just found about microsoft visual studio code
<Psi-Jack>	Pop quiz: In Linux, what is "virtual memory" actually?
<loganlee>	downloading now...
<Gaming4JC>	Psi-Jack: Swap?
<Psi-Jack>	No
<pingfloyd>	and abstraction of all memory resources
<Psi-Jack>	pingfloyd: Ding ding ding!
<pingfloyd>	seen as one pool from the outside
<Gaming4JC>	hmm
<Psi-Jack>	Lot of poeple think it's swap. :)
*	Aww is now known as [2813308004]
<pingfloyd>	Gaming4JC: swap is an aspect of virtual memory
<Gaming4JC>	ah :o
<pingfloyd>	one of the resourcs
<Gaming4JC>	so what's the other resources?
<Psi-Jack>	But, physical RAM is also an aspect of virtual memory.
<Gaming4JC>	besides physical ram
<pingfloyd>	there's physical memory
<diegoviola>	what are your thoughts on ZRAM?
<Gaming4JC>	ah
<diegoviola>	well, swapping to zram
<loganlee>	i just found about microsoft visual studio code
<loganlee>	downloading now...
<pingfloyd>	those are the two most common, but there can be others
<Psi-Jack>	loganlee: Immaterial. And we don't need you to repeat.
*	[2813308004] is now known as cyberme
<malaprop>	loganlee: microsoft visual studio code?
<storge>	2016 dream team: Poettering/Reiser
<Psi-Jack>	cyberme: Are you done nick-flooding?
<storge>	i use zram for over a year now, never a problem.
<malaprop>	storge: I would expect Poettering/Sievers, but sure
<ayecee>	two nicks in two minutes, now a nick flood.
<cyberme>	Psi-Jack, not yet, sorry
*	crazyhead42 is now known as pizzahead42
<Psi-Jack>	As thought, he was going to continue. :p
<Aww>	now I am
<Aww>	:)
<storge>	diegoviola: i allocate 50% ram (of a mere 2G ram) to zram, and in my particular uses, not a problem yet.
<michaelrose>	not sure I see the point of zram outside of phones and even getting more limited for that use case
<storge>	(well, 25% per proc of a dual proc)
<michaelrose>	ram is super cheap
<storge>	michaelrose: not when you have really old machines like i do
<storge>	older ram is more expensive
<michaelrose>	man I want a new computer
<Psi-Jack>	heh. Now, next pop quiz: What is Virtual Memory Overcommitting?
<cppking>	hello guys,  how to set the owner and group of destination files after using rsync??
<storge>	i really just set up zram as an experiment, but since it never caused a single issue, i've just let it roll since 2013 or so
<Psi-Jack>	cppking: chown
<storge>	isn't there an rsync flag to preserve perms?
<Psi-Jack>	storge: Preserve, yes.
<Psi-Jack>	He didn't ask that.
<storge>	oh, maybe not owner/group though, i'm not sure.
<Psi-Jack>	He asked how to change owner/group /AFTER/ running rsync. :)
<Psi-Jack>	Keyword: After.
<cppking>	Psi-Jack: you mean I have to run chown on remote server after rsyncd ?
<Psi-Jack>	Well, that IS what you asked.
<Psi-Jack>	That is the answer to the actual asked question.
<Psi-Jack>	There's also a couple methods to set the owner and group during the transfer itself.
<neonrooster>	got a viral sledgehammer that will kill the Linux kernel dead?
<neonrooster>	Linux's graphics stack won't support my Intel card connected to one monitor and my Nouveau Nvidia card connected to another
<neonrooster>	even under Xorg the Nvidia monitor is a blank screen
<Psi-Jack>	neonrooster: That is unfortunate.
<ayecee>	neonrooster: you could maybe try an actual sledgehammer
<neonrooster>	Psi-Jack: would you mind if I invented a new, improved GNU Hurd that runs ALL Linux apps (binary compatibility)?
<pingfloyd>	cppking: if you want to set the perms and ownership at the same time when copying, take a look at the install command
<neonrooster>	the Linux subsystem lol
<pingfloyd>	if you just want to maintain the existing ones, there should be flags for preserving those with most tools
*	pizzahead42 is now known as crazyhead42
<Psi-Jack>	neonrooster: I care nothing of the Hurd.
<neonrooster>	Psi-Jack: ok, so any way to make Linux better?
<neonrooster>	I'm studying programming, and I said I need to play with Windows
<Psi-Jack>	neonrooster: Less whining, more understanding and learning.
<pingfloyd>	neonrooster: then here's your first programming challenge
<neonrooster>	Psi-Jack: can you suggest a little project so I learn programming?
<Psi-Jack>	neonrooster: Do I look like your instructer?
<neonrooster>	no
<Psi-Jack>	Make a program in every language to print out "Hello world!"
<neonrooster>	Psi-Jack: in Ruby: puts "hello world!"
<diegoviola>	that's very easy way to start
<Psi-Jack>	I said EVERY language, programming language and written language. :)
<diegoviola>	java and C would be more verbose
<annihilannic>	projecteuler.org is a good way to start
<pingfloyd>	neonrooster: it helps to be explicit about what the issue is and any noted messages
<diegoviola>	in Java you need a class and a function, in C you just need a function, main()
<neonrooster>	in C: int main(void) { printf("%s: %s\n" __FUNCTION__, "hello world"); return 0; }
<malaprop>	neonrooster: find something you need that currently sucks and write something better
<annihilannic>	What is __FUNCTION__ for?
<malaprop>	neonrooster: If in doubt, rewrite coreutils :-)
<neonrooster>	to print out the name of the current C function that was executing
<annihilannic>	Ah.
<pingfloyd>	yeah, there's no sin in reinventing an inferior wheel for learning.  You'll walk away with a better understand of the wheel and its challenges.  Just don't push the garbage on the world please.
<Remram>	how do I install X on Fedora?
<Remram>	can't seem to find a package
<Psi-Jack>	Remram: It comes pre-installed?
<neonrooster>	pingfloyd: ok, then erm... I need a Btrfs for Windows
<annihilannic>	correction: projecteuler.net
<neonrooster>	and a userspace Btrfs FUSE FS for Linux
<Psi-Jack>	Remram: It's also xorg
<pingfloyd>	neonrooster: so get to the typing
<Psi-Jack>	Remram: Also, yum grouplist
<neonrooster>	pingfloyd: how do I code something that advanced when I'm just starting?
<neonrooster>	seems impossible, no?
<Psi-Jack>	Then you can groupinstall the one that's for X. :)
<Remram>	Psi-Jack: https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/packages/xorg%2A/
<annihilannic>	neonrooster: depends how clever you think you are
<pingfloyd>	neonrooster: you need to get down the basics first
<Remram>	I see a xorg-x11-server there but my yum won't find it
<neonrooster>	but how? I'm reading Learn Ruby The Hard Way
<pingfloyd>	neonrooster: learn the basics of C, then you can deconstruct how they're going about things
<neonrooster>	pingfloyd: ok, I will open my book up
<pingfloyd>	extrapolate understanding from it
<Psi-Jack>	Remram: yum grouplist
<Remram>	a group contains non-existent packages?
<pingfloyd>	neonrooster: like maybe read K&R first at least
<Psi-Jack>	A group contains a list of packages to install
<diegoviola>	Ruby is easy to learn, what's hard for me to still grasp about Ruby is the difference between Procs and lambdas
<neonrooster>	pingfloyd: Yes that very book
<Remram>	I just want the X server
<pingfloyd>	and then looking at their code will help as you see demonstration of in existing code
<diegoviola>	Procs are procedures, lambdas is a special type of Proc
<Remram>	"No manual entry for yum" wth is this distribution
<diegoviola>	IIRC
<Psi-Jack>	Remram: Obviously not Fedora.
<Remram>	it is though
<Psi-Jack>	Or, you did the ultimate minimum installation.
<malaprop>	neonrooster: Have a look at some of the books on http://doc.cat-v.org/programming/ ?
<Remram>	yes
<Psi-Jack>	Because the yum manpage comes installed with the yum rpm itself.
<Psi-Jack>	So, NO SIR, that is not Fedora.
<Remram>	Package yum-3.4.3-153.fc21.noarch already installed and latest version
<Psi-Jack>	Remram: Is this a VPS?
<Remram>	no why?
<pingfloyd>	survey says!
<Psi-Jack>	That system is very broken.
<Remram>	why, does Fedora come in different flavors?
<Psi-Jack>	Well, there's "Spins", but not the reason I was asking.
<pingfloyd>	Remram: because it's trying to be trendy
<Psi-Jack>	I've heard of VPS's bastardizing distros.
<pingfloyd>	Remram: or some other equally arbitrary reason
<Psi-Jack>	For example, claiming to provide CentOS, but no yum.
<Psi-Jack>	And no rpm. :)
<Psi-Jack>	CentOS without rpm or yum is not CentOS.
<Remram>	well yum is there and quite frankly not very impressive
<pingfloyd>	it depends on the provider's engineers
<pingfloyd>	hopefully you get one that believes in not bastardizing things
<Remram>	oh I see a xorg-x11-server-Xorg.x86_64
<Remram>	which is not on admin.fedoraproject.irg/pkgdb
<Remram>	wtf?
<Remram>	how broken is that distrib?
<Psi-Jack>	Fedora is not broken.
<Remram>	I thought people were using that stuff
<Remram>	well I want to believe but can't live on faith alone
<Psi-Jack>	You've already said you have yum, but no manpage for yum, which is impossible in a Fedora system
<pingfloyd>	the one from getfedora.org should work
<Psi-Jack>	So, again, what you have, is not Fedora.
<pingfloyd>	i.e., official fedora
<Psi-Jack>	And Fedora also installs a Desktop Environment, by default.
<Psi-Jack>	Which includes Xorg.
<pingfloyd>	Remram: your installation sounds broken
<Remram>	how do I fix it?
<pingfloyd>	I've never seen the issues you describe in fedora
<Psi-Jack>	Ditto. :)
<Remram>	I'm running "yum reinstall yum"
<diegoviola>	GNOME users, what extensions do you use to make the experience less annoying?
<pingfloyd>	I haven't ran fedora extensively, but I've ran it for stretches in the past
<Remram>	somehow I now have the manpage
<ayecee>	how convenient!
<pingfloyd>	only problem it ever had for me was its ugly font hinting
<Psi-Jack>	pingfloyd: Which can be fixed. :D
<pingfloyd>	which I had to hack a bit
<pingfloyd>	yeah, I fixed it
<Psi-Jack>	With the infinality stuff. Easily done these days.
<Remram>	this VM is broken and I'll ditch it
<pingfloyd>	yeah, infiniality solved that for a few distros with that issue
<Psi-Jack>	Remram: That's what I would recommend, something "seriously wrong" happened.
<x2f>	hey there
<x2f>	what is the linux distro used for hosting a minecraft server
<x2f>	free at that
<Remram>	where do I get a netinstall or whatever they call it?
<Remram>	all I can find is a live CD
<Remram>	(which is not even CD-sized)
<Psi-Jack>	x2f: ...
<Remram>	ok, only the server flavor has a netinstall. Got it.
<Remram>	ok, 2h for 400MB, let's try another mirror...
<Psi-Jack>	Try them all, simultaneously!
<Remram>	ok I found a "sysadmin manual"
<triceratux>	Remram: start over & put in the xfce spin & youll have no problems whatsoever https://spins.fedoraproject.org/ https://spins.fedoraproject.org/xfce/#downloads otherwise noone can vouch for what happens ;)
<storge>	"no problems whatsoever"
<storge>	sounds like a guarantee
<Remram>	why does a distrib need packages, groups, spins and flavors?
<storge>	why not
<Psi-Jack>	Remram: Size
<Remram>	don't packages do what they need?
<andrew39>	why are files created in windows marked as executable
<Psi-Jack>	Remram: If Fedora came with Gnome, KDE, XFCE, LXQT, and /everything/, it would be 7 DVDs.
<andrew39>	(in permission settings)
<Remram>	andrew39: Windows filesystems don't have an executable bit, so you either mount as "all executable" or "nothing executable"
<Psi-Jack>	Hmmm.
*	sins-_i is now known as sins-
<andrew39>	how do you choose the mount option
<Remram>	andrew39: you pass them to mount, or put them in /etc/fstab
<andrew39>	i scp'd some files over, and they're all marked executable
<Remram>	andrew39: unmark them afterwards
<Psi-Jack>	Remram: NTFS
<Remram>	rsync has a --chmod
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<pingfloyd>	I'm not even sure how linux handles ntfs perms
<Remram>	it doesn't
<pingfloyd>	that's what I was guessing
<pingfloyd>	it's in the mount itself huh
<Remram>	it just maps every file to a single uid/gid/chmod
<loganlee>	hey friends
*	loganlee is drining mother
*	loganlee is drinikng mother
<Psi-Jack>	loganlee: Please log off IRC. You are drunk and shouldn't be here.
<triceratux>	pingfloyd: fat32 uses mount with "-o umask=" & ntfs is apparently the same http://superuser.com/questions/589763/how-to-mount-an-ntfs-filesystem-allowing-all-users-full-access
<klync>	trying to figure out why dig can't resolve a particular name when querying my home router, but it works on another dns server, as well as if I query the upstream (authoritative) server as well. my router *will* return the SOA for the domain, but when I ask for this A record, it returns QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1
<Psi-Jack>	klync: Sounds like your router's DNS server is broken.
<klync>	Psi-Jack: hm, not sure if there's any way to flush its cache, but as I mentioned, it *does* return the SOA
<Psi-Jack>	Probably cache.
*	Remram votes cache as well
<klync>	thanks ... I'll see if I can flush it and try again
<Remram>	5 4 3 0 and boom! watermelon.
<Psi-Jack>	Hut hut
<pingfloyd>	there has to be some way to flush it, otherwise you need to literally flush it.
<pingfloyd>	or push out 16th story window
<Psi-Jack>	Down the toire
<pingfloyd>	the didn't do their homework in this From Dusk Till Dawn Series
<pingfloyd>	guy decapitated a vampire and its body was still attacking him
<Remram>	how many weeks to install Fedora?
<Psi-Jack>	Remram: < 1
<Remram>	oh good
<Remram>	alright Fedora booted to a grey screen
<Remram>	I'm tired of this shit, gonna go back to my Debian and forget about this nonsense
<Voyage>	how to flush history if its not saved yet?
<Remram>	Voyage: history of what?
<Voyage>	of commands
<Voyage>	in .bash_history
<Remram>	history -w
<Remram>	wait no, history -a
<Voyage>	Remram,  hmm. I typed some commands yesterday and they do not appear now
<Voyage>	how to just copy contents of a dir (including all hidden files and what not) to an other dir (both dirs exit)?
<toothe>	when I login via terminal, I noticed that I see "you have X security updates" but when I login via ssh I don't see them.
<malaprop>	Voyage: cp dir1/* dir2; cp dir1/.* dir2 ?
<Voyage>	malaprop,  no. * wont copy .hidden files
<pingfloyd>	Voyage: history -c if you want the entire history gone
<Voyage>	malaprop,  oh you added .*
<Voyage>	pingfloyd,  i dont want it to erase.
<malaprop>	Voyage: Yes. There may be a better way
<pingfloyd>	oh, if you want to flush, it's -w or exit the session
<pingfloyd>	normally your shell will flush when you exit
<malaprop>	Is their a way to enable globbing of hidden files in the various shells?
<malaprop>	Because giving .files special treatment seems Windowsy
<[R]>	malaprop: bash has some options to control globing
<[R]>	malaprop: there have been .files in unix long before windows even was a glimmer in gates' eye
<malaprop>	[R]: Yes, but treating certain files as special seems rather anti-UNIX
<[R]>	nothing is "special"
<[R]>	but like i said
<[R]>	unix has has .files since the dawn of time
<[R]>	so i think its just your view that is incorrect
<malaprop>	[R]: I suppose the non-globbing of leading . is to avoid . and ..
<malaprop>	[R]: As I understand it, the '.files are hidden conf files' started much later
<[R]>	nothing is 'hidden'
<malaprop>	[R]: I understand that, [R]!
<malaprop>	[R]: But .files that are not . and .. should be matched by globs, I believe
<[R]>	[09:18:44] <[R]> malaprop: bash has some options to control globing
<malaprop>	[R]: mksh does not, sadly
<[R]>	that sounds unfortunate
<[R]>	use a better shell then
<malaprop>	[R]: bash??
<[R]>	well i DID just say
<[R]>	[09:23:44] <[R]> [09:18:44] <[R]> malaprop: bash has some options to control globing
<malaprop>	[R]: To each his own
<malaprop>	[R]: I was posing a larger question as to why most shells do not glob .foo
<[R]>	because thats just the way it is
<[R]>	* doesn't match .
<malaprop>	[R]: You are quite the philosopher, [R]
<[R]>	go find the bourne guy
<[R]>	and ask him
<[R]>	if hes still alive
<triceratux>	malaprop: thatz why given the choice between globbing & parsing ls ill always choose the latter. i actually need my scripts to worq
<pingfloyd>	malaprop: man bash | grep dotglob -A5
<triceratux>	globbing is shell dependent & thus will always be broken. ls is a program
<proprietarysucks>	why not use find
<kerneloopz>	quick question, what's the generally recommended application for remote desktop sharing between two Linux computers? I see there are a number of VNC clients in the Ubuntu repos. Which one is the recommended one?
<pingfloyd>	no, this is an issue with a crappy shell it turns out
<[R]>	kerneloopz: its all the same crap really
<proprietarysucks>	guis are for suckers
<proprietarysucks>	ascii is the way to go bro
<malaprop>	triceratux: Indeed
<pingfloyd>	gimp works great in ascii!
<pingfloyd>	same with blender
<proprietarysucks>	those are for newbs
<kerneloopz>	yeah, I know. But seriously, what's the best one for GUIs?
<kerneloopz>	asking for a friend
<proprietarysucks>	tigervnc?
<pingfloyd>	ha! blender is for newbs
<proprietarysucks>	I make shakes by putting fruit on stones and rubbing them with wood until mushy, then I squeeze cow milk on them and lick it up
<pingfloyd>	kerneloopz: pick whichever vnc client you like the best and tunnel it in ssh or something
<proprietarysucks>	blender is for newb
<pingfloyd>	you're a newb
<proprietarysucks>	I'm a blender?
<`\\\`>	neubes
<kerneloopz>	why tigervnc?
<pingfloyd>	tigervnc is for newbs
<proprietarysucks>	because it's a tiger
<proprietarysucks>	do you need more answers than tiger?
<kerneloopz>	tigervnc isn't in the Ubuntu repos...
<proprietarysucks>	if they had chucknorrisvnc I would recommend that one but basically the most non-newby sounding one is tiger
<proprietarysucks>	ubuntu is for newbs
<kerneloopz>	I'm serious guys, what's the recommended application?
<pingfloyd>	some of the vnc servers and client have their own encryption built in, but I don't know how much I would trust it
<triceratux>	malaprop: properly scripted find is basically the best way to go across platforms & shells
<proprietarysucks>	apt-cache search vnc
*	Z_ is now known as Guest10035
<kerneloopz>	I've done that
<kerneloopz>	so many results
<proprietarysucks>	take your pick they all work
<kerneloopz>	so I'm hoping for some recommendations
<[R]>	[09:30:16] <[R]> kerneloopz: its all the same crap really
<proprietarysucks>	oh, what about vino
<proprietarysucks>	I think newbuntu people like that one because it sounds european
<pingfloyd>	kerneloopz: with vnc, it's more a question of how bloated a client you want
<kerneloopz>	I just want it to work. I'm not so Linux purist that I need a tiny client
<proprietarysucks>	if you chose ubuntu you obviously crave bloat
<proprietarysucks>	so just find the largest package and that's probably the one you want ;D
<pingfloyd>	then use whatever ubuntu recommends
*	kerneloopz is running Linux Mint
<proprietarysucks>	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNC/Servers
<pingfloyd>	as it will probably be the best supported one
<proprietarysucks>	"Vino is the default VNC server in Ubuntu to share your existing desktop with other users. "
<kerneloopz>	thanks
<proprietarysucks>	there you go buddy, drink up some vino
<kerneloopz>	sounds great, I'll take a look
<proprietarysucks>	and you know, drive home
<pingfloyd>	kerneloopz: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNC/Clients
<proprietarysucks>	I think there should be a linux distro where everything is the same as another one except the packages have cooler names
<viscera>	proprietarysucks: you could prefix everything with "le" or "la", e.g. "le-bash"
<proprietarysucks>	Nutpunch Linux based on centos but everything is cooler
<pingfloyd>	looks like their default vinagre
<proprietarysucks>	instead of yum.... 'idiot'
<proprietarysucks>	idiot give me fireballs
<proprietarysucks>	(yum install firefox)
<proprietarysucks>	akin to that language.... brainfck but a command masking layer
<proprietarysucks>	hey moron whats happening on port 22 but no stupid dns -> tcpdump -nn port 22
<proprietarysucks>	man I'm a jenius.. this is going to be the next big thing... bigger than myspace....
*	proprietarysucks off to get vc funding
<pingfloyd>	sounds like another turd in the distro pool
<viscera>	proprietarysucks: don't you mean "money from rich guys"?
<proprietarysucks>	yes that might be the name: Nutpunch Linux: 69 (Brown Turd)
<pingfloyd>	Floppy Floater
<proprietarysucks>	LOL
<toothe>	gah! I have a fresh install of Ubuntu and grep keeps returning the filename.
<proprietarysucks>	quiet dude I'm at work... almost blew my cover laughing at that one
<pingfloyd>	or Tarded Turd
<CHVNX>	Tastey Turd
<proprietarysucks>	Toasted Turd?
<pingfloyd>	Tainted Turd
<pingfloyd>	brown edition
<proprietarysucks>	See, the idea is marvelous
<pingfloyd>	make the theme obsessively brown like ubuntu is with orange
<proprietarysucks>	I was so busy trying to think of useful contributions to the community I forgot about all the useless contributions in the world
<proprietarysucks>	or maybe... I can haz Linecks
<CHVNX>	Want to contribute? Add native colour support for apt-get output. Help the world.
<proprietarysucks>	I don't use newb apt
<pingfloyd>	you install through punchcards?
<pingfloyd>	I'm beginning to think Tainted Turd if vaporware
<pingfloyd>	*is
<proprietarysucks>	I shout at my computer until the programs install themselves
<proprietarysucks>	anything else is newbery
<proprietarysucks>	pingfloyd, no it just smells that way
<pingfloyd>	I bet hurd will come out before the turd
<pingfloyd>	hurd got beaten by Duke Nukem Forever though
<proprietarysucks>	If I cared at all about hurd that would be the perfect platform ... man.... Hurd Turd
<CHVNX>	https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/news/2015-04-10-releases.html
<CHVNX>	GNU Hurd 0.6, GNU Mach 1.5, GNU MIG 1.5 released.
<CHVNX>	 2015-04-10
<proprietarysucks>	0.x stable?
<CHVNX>	https://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2015/04/msg00047.html
<CHVNX>	Debian GNU/Hurd 2015 released
<CHVNX>	Five days ago.
<proprietarysucks>	anyone here work on filesystems professionally
<proprietarysucks>	(on developing a filesystem)
<pingfloyd>	you sure that's not just release as in Debian release of it?
<pingfloyd>	actually looks like they constantly release, it's just not in stable status.
<pingfloyd>	though it may never have that status
<CHVNX>	You've never used Debian Hurd?
<CHVNX>	That means you've never used Hurd, probably.
<toothe>	that still exists?
<pingfloyd>	I use Debian linux
<pingfloyd>	gnu kind of side steps the question about it being "released"
<pingfloyd>	http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/faq/release.html
<pingfloyd>	instead they answer it with another question
<CHVNX>	What part of "GNU Hurd 0.6 has been released" are you having difficulty understanding?
<pingfloyd>	they're sort of playing the semantics games with the word "release"
<CHVNX>	No, they're just admitting that it lacks common features of more popular operating systems.
<CHVNX>	If Linux ever "finished"?
<CHVNX>	s/if/is
<pingfloyd>	release doesn't mean finished anyway
<CHVNX>	About 78% of the Debian software archive are available for Hurd.
<Igramul>	Hi, is there any "official" way to place swap space on network shares?
<pingfloyd>	debian has had many releases of debian, doesn't mean they stop developing it.
<pingfloyd>	they're being wishy washy about answering the question in that FAQ
<CHVNX>	pingfloyd: Exactly. Just like Hurd. That's what that the rhetorical questions was trying to say.
<Igramul>	CHVNX: Software that has to react on changing environments can never be "finished".
<CHVNX>	Igramul: Exactly. Thus, Hurd is "released" but unfinished.
<pingfloyd>	they're purposed being obtuse the implications of the word "release"
<pingfloyd>	*to the
<proprietarysucks>	hence why I asked about stable
<proprietarysucks>	of course nothing is generally ever 'finished' in software
<pingfloyd>	it's a lawyer's answer
<`\\\`>	can it play tux cart?
<proprietarysucks>	but we have methods for what can be defined as stable I believe
<proprietarysucks>	can you guys start sending me money for my new Turtle Turd distro or what
<diegoviola>	do we need yet another distro?
<`\\\`>	yes
<`\\\`>	to the distro, not to sending this guy money
<proprietarysucks>	I remember on my thirty turd birthday I knew I wanted to do something special and now I know what it is... a new distro.. I should make a kickstarter campaign
<`\\\`>	will it be all turtle-themed?
<proprietarysucks>	turtle head themed maybe
<proprietarysucks>	I was thinking a nice abstraction layer with crass english to interface with the system
<proprietarysucks>	hey dumbass install a web server -> yum install -y httpd
<Loshki>	Because the world has desperate shortage of distros, and you can help by producing another.
<proprietarysucks>	yes I know that's why I'm doing it.. finally one to compete
*	unpro is now known as Guest2765
<Loshki>	Igramul: re: swap space on network shares - you can swap to a file, dunno if it has to be local, but I would imagine so. Swapping is bad enough, swapping over a network seems like a terrible idea.
<Loshki>	Igramul: Are there "unofficial" ways to do it? Do tell...
<EI24>	hi, when i  try to copy code from a pdf document, using evince viewer, into a text editor. The code become all messed up. Is there a way to copy code from a pdf without messing it up?
<[R]>	get a better pdf/
<annihilannic>	EI24: There are some pdf2txt tools around, one of those might do a better job of it.
<EI24>	annihilannic: yes, maybe that will work, but found out the program costs x)
<MetaNova>	EI24: I'd suggest trying a different pdf viewer (of which there are a number, I'd personally reach for xpdf myself)
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	Do I have to do something once I reset the dbus system policy?
<Igramul>	Loshki: "unofficial" way -> create a 20GB file on the network, format it to ext4, mount it via loopback device, place a swap file in it
<EI24>	MetaNova: is it open source?
<MetaNova>	EI24: well sure
<LinuxManDan>	Does anyone use Kazam in Linux?
<Igramul>	Loshki: It is ugly and I assume that the system crashes if, e.g., cifsd, is swapped out.
*	diego1 is now known as diegoviola
<RingtailedFox>	hiya guys... i'm wondering if there's a security DVR program available for linux users... been trying to find one, but they all seem to insist on Windows XP/Vista/7... if i'm lucky, i'd find one that says "Mac OS X" too...
<SirLagz>	RingtailedFox: motion and/or zoneminder
<RingtailedFox>	mkay lemme look those up
<RingtailedFox>	are they fine with multi-camera setups?
<SirLagz>	RingtailedFox: sure
<RingtailedFox>	good, good
<aBound>	RingtailedFox: MythTV?
<aBound>	:P
<RingtailedFox>	lol
<aBound>	It's a program.
<aBound>	:)
<aBound>	https://www.mythtv.org
<RingtailedFox>	i know what mythtv is
<RingtailedFox>	i didn't think it could also view or record/save from surveillance cameras
<aBound>	Ahh, I didn't see that part of the sentence. I'd have to check on that aspect.
<RingtailedFox>	:)
<LinuxManDan>	Has anyone tried the Kazam 1.5.3 development version yet?
<aBound>	https://www.mythtv.org/wiki/MythZoneMinder
<RingtailedFox>	had to put cameras up ever since my crackhead neighbours decided to try to drive their pickup truck into my house lol
<SirLagz>	RingtailedFox: nutters
<RingtailedFox>	oh yes
<SirLagz>	I'm using motion myself
<aBound>	Oh my.
<RingtailedFox>	i'll try zoneminder or motion.. hell, i'll install both and see what works
<SirLagz>	got it emailing me everytime my cameras detects motion
<SirLagz>	don't get too many false alerts which is good
<SirLagz>	but I have one USB camera and one IP camera lol
<SirLagz>	need to replace my other usb camera with an IP Camera
<diegoviola>	hrm, gnome is actually decent with some extensions
<diegoviola>	AlternateTab fixed my annoyance with it
<RingtailedFox>	but first, i should switch the machine from KDE4 to LXDE so it doesn't bog down as much.... upgraded the monitor from 1440x900 to using my HDTV as a monitor.. went from fast as hell to a snail
<aBound>	Hehehe.
<RingtailedFox>	it has a decent graphics card in it (nVidia PNY GeForce GT 430
<RingtailedFox>	)
<LinuxManDan>	Am I bein ignored or are my messages not gettin through?
<RingtailedFox>	linuxboytoo, what's your question/
<RingtailedFox>	LinuxManDan, sorry\
<SirLagz>	LinuxManDan: I haven't used Kazam 1.5.3.
<RingtailedFox>	what's kazam?
<SirLagz>	Screen recorder IIRC ?
<LinuxManDan>	I am just wonderin if any one has tried the development version and had success broadcastin with it.
<LinuxManDan>	Screen recorder and added live stream capability
<RingtailedFox>	unfortunately, i don't think anyone here has tried it...
<LinuxManDan>	Okay.
<aBound>	Probably best sticking with a stable version.
<RingtailedFox>	wait, is it like OpenBroadcaster?
<LinuxManDan>	Maybe.  I don't have a system capable for Open Broadcaster.
<RingtailedFox>	nor do i
<RingtailedFox>	stupid intel integrated laptop graphics card.. :P
<LinuxManDan>	MIght be able to with a video card installed.  I have an nvidia geforce 210 but not sur eif this system can use it (power supply not 300 or better)
<RingtailedFox>	your power supply is only 300 watts?
<LinuxManDan>	I think the one in here is 250 or somethin like that.
<RingtailedFox>	i'm surprised you're able to boot!  ram, hard drive, DVD-RW drive'll eat that up pretty damnquick
<SirLagz>	RingtailedFox: not on modern systems
<RingtailedFox>	perhaps
<RingtailedFox>	though just to be safe, i shoved a 750 watt PSU in my tower
<LinuxManDan>	I am runnin a 64Bit system.  Dual Core 3Ghz
<SirLagz>	I know someone running an i7 with 6? SATA drives on a 300W PSU :P
<RingtailedFox>	have to chain it down to keep its fans from having it take off
<LinuxManDan>	This is one of those Small Form Factor systems I believe.
<SirLagz>	I only have a 380 in my 7 drive NAS
<RingtailedFox>	that thing runs cool as hell, though.  rarely passes 35 C... usually closer to 25 C
<LinuxManDan>	Actually my first 64bit system.
<RingtailedFox>	awesome!
<LinuxManDan>	I started with a dual boot then went all linux.
<RingtailedFox>	congrats on moving into the modern era
<LinuxManDan>	lol RingtailedFox
<RingtailedFox>	dual-booting's alright
<RingtailedFox>	it's fine if you have a printer that only works in windows, for example
<aBound>	Full Linux must of been tough for you. :P
<LinuxManDan>	I have no printer.  Have no use for one really.
<LinuxManDan>	Not at all.  Been playin around with linux since the old days.
<RingtailedFox>	meh, full linux is fine. have one machine that runs mageia, one that runs windows 7 for my games (though with steam going to linux to... that might change)
<LinuxManDan>	At least since the old days of Red hat.
<RingtailedFox>	same. first distro i ran was RH9
<aBound>	Hehehe, I switched to Full Linux back in 2011.
<aBound>	I'm still a Ubuntu user.
<LinuxManDan>	I don';t do much for games.  What I do run is fine either in Linux Wine or in a virtual machine
<aBound>	:)
<RingtailedFox>	same
<RingtailedFox>	in fact.. what's weird isthat the couple prorgams i run in wine, actually run BETTER there than on windows
<LinuxManDan>	I am runnin LInux mint on a tablet PC and Q4OS on the desktop.  I also run Ubuntu Studio off USB
<aBound>	Tweaking is cool and all. But most people have to get stuff done...
<SirLagz>	I went full linux years ago...don't remember when haha
<RingtailedFox>	i told the developers of them (Notepad++ being one of them) and they laughed and said that's awesome :P
<RingtailedFox>	aBound, i read that as Twerking is cool and all... :P
<SirLagz>	RingtailedFox: too much watching Miley Cyrus :P
<aBound>	Teehee RingtailedFox.
<RingtailedFox>	:D
<rumpel>	RingtailedFox, that's even the case for some games afaik (more fps)
<aBound>	Hey now Miley is my kind of woman. :P
<LinuxManDan>	I decided it was time to scrap Win when MS stopped support for XP.
<SirLagz>	I decided it was time to scrap when my computer suddenly decided it wasn't legally purchased windows
<LinuxManDan>	I shoulda done it back when 98 went out.
<RingtailedFox>	Windows Genuine Advantage went from saying you were legal, to illegal?
<aBound>	I played Borderlands the Prequel on Ubuntu. Ran pretty dang well on the nvidia card.
<SirLagz>	RingtailedFox: something like that yeah
<RingtailedFox>	that happened to me on XP Pro back in 2004... turned out microsoft's WGA servers got hacked and they had to shut them down... but it happened a few more times after that, too... so i went to fedora for a while :p
<SirLagz>	and a few other things like NTLDR going missing randomly a few timse
<LinuxManDan>	Took me years to go from 98 to XP and after XP enough was enough.
<SirLagz>	got Steam working in Wine back then and went full linux years ago
<MonkehParade>	https://xkcd.com/519/ this speaks volumes
<SirLagz>	the only windows machines I have left is a netbook that I was given, and a couple of dualboot laptops that barely ever sees windows 7
<SirLagz>	MonkehParade: indeed
<aBound>	Plus+ one up for MS opening C#. :P
<MonkehParade>	I'm just waiting for Visual Studio on Linux.
<LinuxManDan>	My Win system is still runnin Win 98 with 128MB ram
<MonkehParade>	They've already release VS Code for Linux.
<SirLagz>	MonkehParade: have you tried VS Code ?
<RingtailedFox>	i'm not knocking MS... they hit a home run with Windows 7.. i just feel that with hacking events going on as they are, perhaps it'stime to switch to Team Penguinfull time
<LinuxManDan>	What exactly is steam?  Heard of i but haven't actually used it/
<zChris>	You hilarious linuxboytoo
<zChris>	LinuxManDan
<jamesbdev>	Hi, can someone please help me with bash if statement? I'm trying to do something if any of three variables are empty. "if [[ !(-z $3 || -z $4 || -z $5) ]]
<RingtailedFox>	steam is a game marketplace where you can buy games and download them andinstall them in Windows, mac and linu
<LinuxManDan>	:D
<RingtailedFox>	*linux
<aBound>	MonkehParade: They have Visual Studio Code for Windows, OS X and Linux. It's more of a text editor rather than an IDE it's still limited.
<LinuxManDan>	I don't do games much, at least none that others do.
<RingtailedFox>	*nods*
<trae32566[w]>	yo
<trae32566[w]>	systemctl status --type service should show all services right?
<aBound>	Aha, we were thinking the same thing.
<trae32566[w]>	for some reason it doesn't seem to be showing iscsid, which is actually running and can be seen using 'systemctl status iscsid.service'
<RingtailedFox>	i dunno, i kinda miss sysvinit ;P
<jamesbdev>	Hi, can someone help me? Trying to check if any of three variables are empty in bash. "if [[ !(-z $3 -o -z $4 -o -z $5) ]]"
<aBound>	Systemd. :P
<RingtailedFox>	i dunno.. when systemd first launched, it corrupted itself a LOT.. i went back to sysvinit for over a year while i waited for systemd to mature :p
<aBound>	Ubuntu is going to have it by default in the 16.04 release. MIR is supposed to be implemented to in that release replacing X.
*	trae32566[w] smacks Mir 
<trae32566[w]>	for fucks sake just use wayland
<RingtailedFox>	whats the point of MIR?
<aBound>	Aha, that won't happen.
<RingtailedFox>	isit gonna de-orbit and crash in the pacific? :P
<trae32566[w]>	so that they can be 'special'
<RingtailedFox>	ugh
<RingtailedFox>	that's why i hate ubuntu
<trae32566[w]>	just like Ubuntu always LOVES to be 'special'
<trae32566[w]>	yes
<RingtailedFox>	also,hooray for linux-based spyware! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(user_interface)#Privacy_controversy
<trae32566[w]>	it's why everyone who hates Ubuntu does
<trae32566[w]>	oh yeah
<trae32566[w]>	thats old
<RingtailedFox>	you now it's bad when eventhe ever-tolerant andaccepting RMS hates it :p
<aBound>	Canonical is a business just like Apple and MS. They're trying to dominate the Linux desktop market by either creating forks whilst making it as their own. Thus, creates the entire convergence aspect they are vying for.
<RingtailedFox>	how do they support themselves in finance?
<aBound>	It's impossible to entirely live in an open source world.
<pingfloyd>	what do you mean by convergence aspect?
<RingtailedFox>	so much for debian's attempts, then?
<aBound>	Progression requires funding.
<RingtailedFox>	hmm
<pingfloyd>	and it will become equally as bad as the other 2 in time
<RingtailedFox>	in time? it's already there :p
<RingtailedFox>	hmm... my security system is LAN-connected... will zoneminer be able to access it, or does it require *direct* access?
<aBound>	By convergence I'm implying that they're trying to be like MS and Apple creating a cohesive OS. That puts Linux in a structured environment.
<pingfloyd>	I see
<pingfloyd>	they want to compete with those 2
<RingtailedFox>	yeah but canonical just steals others' work and tries to take credit for it and lock the very creators out
<pingfloyd>	that will just make them a 3rd less than desirable OS
<aBound>	If you noticed they're creating all kinds of in house projects.
<RingtailedFox>	they tried that with gnome and failed
<pingfloyd>	they'll end up homogenized liked those
<RingtailedFox>	they tried to then push "open core" shit and failed
<aBound>	Unity, mir, I believe they're renaming startup disk creator too.
<pingfloyd>	it's like pulling a Palpatine with an OS
<RingtailedFox>	these are not the packages you are looking for...
<RingtailedFox>	:P
<pingfloyd>	glad someone got that
<RingtailedFox>	let us go, and i will offer these two .debs as gifts :P
<aBound>	:P
<RingtailedFox>	well, it's still may the fourth (onthe west coast anyway)... and now it's revenge of the fifth :p
<aBound>	Also, they are going to switch over to Snappy Packages.
<RingtailedFox>	snappy? i take it they're getting tired of causing cconfusion regarding .deb packages?
<pingfloyd>	actually it's the 5th here almost 6th
<RingtailedFox>	nice
<pingfloyd>	but the timing is coincidence
<RingtailedFox>	will they ever stop basing their distro off of Debian Sid?
<aBound>	http://m.webupd8.org/2015/04/ubuntu-desktop-to-eventually-switch-to.html
<pingfloyd>	you're probably better off running sid when it comes down to it than running that
<RingtailedFox>	buncha carpetbaggers... they don't even make their own stuff, they just ride on the coattails of others and profit off their work
<RingtailedFox>	LOL
<RingtailedFox>	a sad state of affairs when Debian Sid is more stable than your creation
<pingfloyd>	sid has some pretty rough edges sometimes though
<pingfloyd>	but they get fixed!
<RingtailedFox>	i tried it for a test run... was between Windows ME and being stabbed while usingthe computer for stability :P
<pingfloyd>	I think the worst experience was having troubles upgrading for like half a day, big whoop
<aBound>	WinME ha don't remind me of those days. :P
<mads>	Hello, does anyone know how i can lookup what entry in the routing table a single host ip will use?
<RingtailedFox>	aBound, we shall never forget
<LinuxManDan>	Who can forget the days of ME or even Vista?
<pingfloyd>	or even 8
<aBound>	RingtailedFox: No kidding, memories are a pain.
<LinuxManDan>	8 a kids toy OS.
<pingfloyd>	you can't forget 8 even if you want to
<RingtailedFox>	my father runs vista, but i'm trying to get thislinux box up and working for him
<RingtailedFox>	all that's holdign us back are the security cameras
<pingfloyd>	vista isn't so bad after sp2
<pingfloyd>	it is practically 7 at that point
<RingtailedFox>	that's like saying a turd isn't so bad if you close your eyes, hold your nose, and dunkk it in antisepctic :p
<aBound>	Secretly Vista must of been using the WinME kernel it had to. jk
<LinuxManDan>	Startin with Vista I think MS has gone insane and only gettin worse.
<pingfloyd>	it was like beta before sp2
<RingtailedFox>	i agree
<RingtailedFox>	SP2 is probably the only vista version worthusing
<RingtailedFox>	but then you should just get 7 anyway
<pingfloyd>	that's MS though, they like to give their paying customers beta tests
<pingfloyd>	and now it has become their reputation
<LinuxManDan>	They have totally went illegal in my opinion usin keylogger in their Win 10 preview.
<RingtailedFox>	how can steve ballmer make something fantastic like 7, then so craptacular like 8?
<RingtailedFox>	wait, there's a keylogger in win10?
<RingtailedFox>	any way to block that withafirewall
<LinuxManDan>	The preview yes
<RingtailedFox>	?
<pingfloyd>	LinuxManDan: source please
<RingtailedFox>	yes please
<viscera>	8 is fine if you pin just what you want to the start screen, and set your file associations to desktop apps
<aBound>	Alright all, enjoy the rest of the day. Sleepy time has arrived see y'all. :)
<RingtailedFox>	i would love to ask my friend (who works at the Bing project) about this
<pingfloyd>	I'm not saying you're wrong, but that is a big implication
<viscera>	pingfloyd: it's a thing
<RingtailedFox>	links, plese
<LinuxManDan>	You can find it all over
<pingfloyd>	viscera: what is?
<LinuxManDan>	http://www.geek.com/microsoft/microsoft-clears-the-air-on-windows-10-keylogger-1606160/
<RingtailedFox>	http://lifehacker.com/windows-10s-keylogger-fiasco-has-been-blown-out-of-pr-1642931793
<viscera>	http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/391114/microsoft-admits-windows-10-preview-has-a-keylogger
<RingtailedFox>	that's stupid though
<RingtailedFox>	instead of hacking millionsof computers for banking info, they just hae to hack microsoft for EVERYONE's info
<viscera>	it was documented in the EULA or whatever ;)
<RingtailedFox>	and i had such high hopes for Windows 10
<viscera>	and it's just the prerelease
<viscera>	RingtailedFox: it won't be in the final
<viscera>	7 and 8 are virtually the same OS, RingtailedFox
<LinuxManDan>	They say it will be removed in the final product, but after that move can they really be trusted?
<pingfloyd>	oh, yeah, I think they tell you though
<RingtailedFox>	too bad 8 is 7 minus the start menu, plus shitty metro apps no one wants, and no desktop :P
<pingfloyd>	it says on the page you have to agree to to download it
<RingtailedFox>	yeah, i'll wait for them to remove the keylogger
<pingfloyd>	that's not really shady if it is that above board.
<brucelee>	installed linux, and did a apt-get dist-install. I reboot, and get a pink screen before grub menu. Anyone know how to troubleshoot this?
<pingfloyd>	you really aren't supposed to use it for anything important anyway
<viscera>	LinuxManDan: http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=5789585&cid=48068363
<RingtailedFox>	if it's for the pre-release, okay. i can unerstand wanting to protect industry trade secrets, but.... be sure to tell people 'this is to ensure windows code integrity and will be removed upon release to market'
<viscera>	RingtailedFox: 8 has a desktop. the metro apps are uninstallable, and the start screen functions just fine if you pin only what you want there, like i said
<RingtailedFox>	i dont want a full-screen start menu, though. i tried windows 8.  made me want to run back to Vista in horror :P
<pingfloyd>	yep, looks like I remember right http://www.geek.com/microsoft/microsoft-clears-the-air-on-windows-10-keylogger-1606160/
<viscera>	RingtailedFox: 8.1 is a lot better
<viscera>	8 != 8.1
<RingtailedFox>	i tried 8.1, which is just a half-way fix
<viscera>	meh, works for me
<RingtailedFox>	yes it is better than pure 8
<RingtailedFox>	but still
<LinuxManDan>	It was short lived but I have tried Win 7.
<pingfloyd>	Windows is rather nosy anyway
<LinuxManDan>	Nevr ran 8
<viscera>	pingfloyd: at least their installer has the decency to let you opt out, unlike ubuntu
<LinuxManDan>	My first ever Win 7 laptop only lasted a few days befor eit was trashed.
<pingfloyd>	it phones home a lot, allegedly with aggregate non identifiable info
<RingtailedFox>	maybe we shoul refer to it as "Poobuntu"
<pingfloyd>	but they could correlate data if they wanted
<LinuxManDan>	Is it all Buntu distros, or just ones with Unity?
<viscera>	LinuxManDan: unity. although the latest one removes the breach i think
<RingtailedFox>	ehh, all the *buntus, just to be safe :P
<viscera>	"but after that move can they really be trusted?" ;)
<RingtailedFox>	but Ubuntu is the smelliest and wipes the least easily
<LinuxManDan>	I prefer Trinity as my desktop, or LXDE/XFCE
<RingtailedFox>	i forgot abotu Trinity
<RingtailedFox>	i should install that on this thing
<viscera>	i prefer windows because linux doesn't care about security from x11 upwards
<RingtailedFox>	ehh... that doesn'treally make sense
<RingtailedFox>	x11 is the windowing manager.... somewhat analagous to "DWM.EXE" (Desktop Window Manager) in windows
<RingtailedFox>	has little to do withsecurity
<viscera>	RingtailedFox: false
<pingfloyd>	it's the windowing server
<RingtailedFox>	yes, sorry
<RingtailedFox>	windowing server
<pingfloyd>	window manager is an xclient
<viscera>	RingtailedFox: take fedora 21 and a thinkpad r61 with intel graphics. logon to gnome with user X, start a second logon to gnome with user Y, lock Y's session and return to user X, then shutdown your computer. notice how the contents of user Y's suposedly locked session are displayed on screen for about a second as a "glitch". realise that x11 must die.
<viscera>	doesn't happen with windows
<RingtailedFox>	yes, and that's why people are trying to replace X11R6.whatevver with Wayland
<viscera>	yep. i can't wait for that
<viscera>	until then, linux on the desktop is a joke
<viscera>	i try and use it from time to time but things like that burn me and i uninstall
<MetaNova>	viscera: a split second? how horrible
<pingfloyd>	you don't really want X11 on your server anyway
<LinuxManDan>	I am the only user on this system and don't worry about such things.
<viscera>	MetaNova: you're really going to apologise for that?
<viscera>	pingfloyd: agreed. i run servers headless
<pingfloyd>	headless or console is fine
<MetaNova>	viscera: I don't recall apologizing for anything
<viscera>	LinuxManDan: i'm glad it works for you, but i expect my os to not do buggy crap like that
<viscera>	MetaNova: you tried to dimish the problem. this is an apologetic of sorts
<LinuxManDan>	Excuse my boldness here, but some are more pickier than others.
<viscera>	true
<MetaNova>	viscera: I'm not diminishing the problem, I'm diminishing just how upset you are with it :P
<pingfloyd>	viscera: I wouldn't trust X11 all that much on a shared system
<viscera>	MetaNova: same thing
<pingfloyd>	X11 has always been considered to bring a bunch of security implications with it
<viscera>	yep. can't wait for it to die.
<MetaNova>	viscera: try OSX then
<MetaNova>	I'm sure you'll like it better
<pingfloyd>	it's always been considered inherently less secure to have it vs. not having it
<viscera>	MetaNova: i'm considering it, but the state of OS X is pretty abysmal these days
<viscera>	pingfloyd: i can't believe linus never pushed for the kernel framebuffer thing and a windowing system around it
<LinuxManDan>	I haven't ran OS X since my PowerPC G4 stopped workin.
<viscera>	but yeah, digression
<viscera>	MetaNova: i'm sort of in a windows 8.1 limbo at the moment by default
<LinuxManDan>	Microsoft can't pay me enough to run their OS these days.
<k_sze[work]>	What are some good utilities beside ping to check if a network destination can be reached?
<k_sze[work]>	like, continuously
<pingfloyd>	viscera: linus care more about it facilitating his kernel development and his family's usage (which is more things just working with minimal hassle).
*	kopfkind_ is now known as kopfkind
<pingfloyd>	he's been very emphatic about not caring about much else
<viscera>	pingfloyd: i suppose. but i imagine that if he put effort into a standard graphical system and infrastructure, linux would be miles ahead right now
<pingfloyd>	besides maybe git
<viscera>	because people would get behind him
<RingtailedFox>	k_sze[work], tracerotue
<RingtailedFox>	*traceroute
<pingfloyd>	viscera: he's for an easy to use desktop
<viscera>	pingfloyd: yep
<viscera>	i want to see if x11 under bsd would be any better... but bsd doesn't have native dropbox support and i am kinda married to it
<LinuxManDan>	I hope that Linux gets better multi-monitor support.
<LinuxManDan>	I have too many issues runnin 2 monitors.
<viscera>	yep. like right now the display manager doesn't get proper multi-monitor support. for some reason it's a per-user setting instead of system-wide, which always strikes me as odd
<pingfloyd>	viscera: try openBSD if you're going to do BSD.  Since you value security a lot.
<LinuxManDan>	Could be the intel graphics
<k_sze[work]>	RingtailedFox: and beside traceroute?
<k_sze[work]>	I'm sure I have heard of some other. I can't remember the name.
<viscera>	pingfloyd: maybe. freebsd gets better support for stuff.
<k_sze[work]>	the name might start with an 'm'
<pingfloyd>	viscera: freebsd definitely has much broader software support, but that's because software has to meet more stringent criteria to be included into openbsd
<MetaNova>	<k_sze[work]> the name might start with an 'm' <-- mtr
<pingfloyd>	a big one is security and license
<k_sze[work]>	yes, mtr
<viscera>	pingfloyd: yep. i actually don't have too complex security requirements. i just don't want my os to do blatantly stupid things
<k_sze[work]>	Thanks MetaNova
<LinuxManDan>	Who do ya think started the idea first for runnin on all possible devices, buntu or winndos?
<LinuxManDan>	MS is goin all out and then some these days for Win 10
<viscera>	can't wait to install me some wintendo
<viscera>	smooth ie scrolling plus a real adblocker... oh yeah
<LinuxManDan>	Never heard of that.  A mix of Nintendo runnin WIndows?
<viscera>	LinuxManDan: word play on win10 ;)
<LinuxManDan>	Ah
<pingfloyd>	viscera: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXS8ljif9b8
<viscera>	i call win10 "wintendo" in my head :D
<LinuxManDan>	Ah, I see.
<LinuxManDan>	Although MS has some interesting tech like the 3d glasses and all I will pass on usin it.
<LinuxManDan>	HoloLens
*	Froolab is now known as Froolap
<grazfather>	hey guys, computer hanged and now i can't connect to a network. Can anyone help diagnose? route -n shows nothing, link isn't ready in dmesg, and eth0 does exist
<dasx32>	how much disk space does a typical lemp stack use (minus database and web files) on say 15.04?
<viscera>	pingfloyd: interesting that he thinks microsoft have got the message but linux largely hasn't.
<pingfloyd>	yeah
<viscera>	pingfloyd: re. compiler safety checks
<sauvin>	What's "15.04"?
<pingfloyd>	and what he said about FreeBSD
<viscera>	pingfloyd: i think redhat do okay, they seem to have a lot of stuff turned on eg. stack smashing protection
<viscera>	pingfloyd: i'm still watching ;)
<xabbix>	I'm trying a simple replace string with sed, trying to add the hostname to a string, this is my bash: HOST=$(HOSTNAME:="test"} \n sed -i "s/tps_node_1/tps_$HOST_node_1/g" filename. I get: tps_. any ideas?
<EI24>	im trying to extract the code from this pdf: http://w8bh.net/avr/AvrTFT.pdf . page 13-last . any idea how i can do this?
<grazfather>	D:
<LinuxManDan>	EI24, tryin to extract the text?
<EI24>	LinuxManDan: yes!
<LinuxManDan>	Try usin Calibre to convert the pdf to text.
<LinuxManDan>	It will also convert to other formats.
<EI24>	LinuxManDan: it worked! Thanks! though i need to edit some small things
<EI24>	but nothing bothersome
<LinuxManDan>	Wonderful.
<LinuxManDan>	Glad to assist.
<LinuxManDan>	I use Calibre all the time to convert to txt files and play around in DOS.  lol
<viscera>	pingfloyd: interesting stuff. he seems like a nice guy
<RingtailedFox>	hmmm.... this is the software that shipped with my camera... are you sure there isn't a linux equivalent? https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=30562
<RingtailedFox>	zoneminder seems pretty complex...
<pingfloyd>	viscera: check this out http://www.openbsd.org/papers/ru13-deraadt/
<RingtailedFox>	oh no! they're droppinglike flies!
<xabbix>	How can I include an env var within an env var in an upstart script? for example: env CONFIG_NODE_NAME=tps_$HOSTNAME_node_1?
<pingfloyd>	xabbix: yes
<pingfloyd>	xabbix: but put the right hand side in ""
<pingfloyd>	in cases where the variable has valid variable name characters do it like ${HOSTNAME}
*	rtfm is now known as rn
<pingfloyd>	*valid variable name character directly beside it
<EI24>	LinuxManDan:yeah, i wonder why you have to go through such a hassle just to convert pdf into text...
<LinuxManDan>	I am an odd one.  I enjoy it.
<LinuxManDan>	I just prefer text over other formats.
<pingfloyd>	like say "foo$VARbar" you would want "foo${VAR}bar"
<Froolap>	EI24: digital rights management.
<xabbix>	pingfloyd, So env CONFIG_NODE_NAME=tps_$(HOSTNAME)_node_1? Or env CONFIG_NODE_NAME=tps_"$HOSTNAME"_node_1?
<Froolap>	you don't have digital writes, only digital reads
<pingfloyd>	xabbix: we're talking bash right?
<pingfloyd>	not some other shell
<xabbix>	pingfloyd, no, upstart script
<xabbix>	not sure if it's considered bash
<rtb>	hey all! i m dealing with compressed log files some of which have been compressed multiple times. i could uncompress them and then use the 'file' command and then go from there. however is there any way to figure out the status within a zcat file.tar.gz scenario? i m trying to avoid writing to disk and then deleting them again
<pingfloyd>	you probably want: CONFIG_NODE_NAME="tps_${HOSTNAME}_node_1"
<pingfloyd>	take notice it is curly brackets
<pingfloyd>	parenthesis is totally different
<jelly>	rtb: you mean like zcat foo.gz | file -  ?
<xabbix>	pingfloyd, OK, this works. kind of. I get a log message from the service itself saying that it cannot resolve HOSTNAME, which is weird since I can resolve it by echoing $HOSTNAME. Any ideas?
<EI24>	Froolap: so thats the reason huh.. hate such laws, obviously made for monopoly
<pingfloyd>	xabbix: it may be that the script is running too early
<xabbix>	I'm running it after the machine is fully booted.. manually
<rtb>	jelly, oh thats nice. did not think of that. thanks.
<utsur>	hello can somebody help me, i want with the command top save all proces, something that # top -n 1 > aaa.txt , its posible save all proces?
<utsur>	only save a portion of all proces
<rtb>	utsur, try ps. e.g. ps -aux | head -n 2
<utsur>	ok thanks rtb
<utsur>	rtb don't write all proces with ps
<rtb>	utsur, sorry. try this ps -aux > aaa.txt
<kurahaupo>	rtb: no "-" on bsd-style options for ps
<rtb>	kurahaupo, i see. thanks the man page does mention this  < Note that "ps -aux" is distinct from "ps aux". > thanks. so if there is no user named 'x' then they re the same.
<rtb>	thanks kurahaupo
<ximianvirk_>	I am testing timeout settings for an iscsi root disk with dm-multipath enabled. A common test is to use dd or touch when failing the storage paths and then checking how the underlying layers respond.
<ximianvirk_>	I have been trying to reproduce the ext4 aborted journal with a read-only filesystem but cannot do that reliably.
<ximianvirk_>	dd to the filesystem with sync and touch are unreliable.
<spreeuw>	so you think your filesystem times out before the medium?
<spreeuw>	or whats the problem?
<ximianvirk_>	spreeuw: random behavior
<ximianvirk_>	at times it does, at times it doesn't
<ximianvirk_>	btw, the filesystem is a vm hosted on xenserver.
<spreeuw>	in both cases I'd just fix the medium
<Sir_Leto>	how would I rename files in a directory recursively? Say I have *.mp4 in directory, and want the files to be named 'name with spaces in it 01,02,03,etc'
<ximianvirk_>	At times, I will only see inode read/write errors. Other times I will see ext4 journal aborted
*	ChanServ gives channel operator status to eir
<ximianvirk_>	spreeuw: the issue with the medium being the san failover which causes root disks on iscsi to go read-only
<ximianvirk_>	that's what I am trying to sort.
*	eir removes ban on *!*dl@staticline-31-183-68-153.toya.net.pl$##fix_your_connection
*	eir removes channel operator status from eir
<ximianvirk_>	so i want to be able to run tests from inside the VM to ensure that I can reliably produce the aborted journal error while I am playing with the timeout settings
*	iBurley_ is now known as iBurley
<spreeuw>	ximianvirk_: mount sync maybe

<revolve>	Can anyone help me decode an machine-check-exception log? we have a server that's rebooting because of one dimm
<peetaur2>	revolve: replace the DIMM :)
<peetaur2>	revolve: is it single socket? just look at the bank number
<revolve>	http://paste.debian.net/hidden/a6c74d4d/
<peetaur2>	otherwise have fun decoding it :) I'm not sure the numbers make sense for multi socket
<revolve>	peetaur2: are the bank numbers 0-based?
<peetaur2>	good question; and I'm not familiar with that output, I mostly look at mcelog and some supermicro thing
<peetaur2>	if you can spare huge downtime (maybe replace all RAM and test in another machine), I would run memtest on it which has perfectly understandable output; and if not, just put half in, test, switch, test
<peetaur2>	(btw mcelog says things like "CPU 4 BANK 8" on a 2 socket system with 6 DIMMs... so wtf is cpu 4 and dimm 8?)
<peetaur2>	does it happen to be a supermicro board with IPMI?
<revolve>	nope, also memtest never catches the thing
<MonkehParade>	I find it sad that I don't find a lot of people with the same enthusiasm I have for coding :c
<revolve>	peetaur2: thanks for the help
<revolve>	peetaur2: it sometimes confuses threads and cores
<peetaur2>	revolve: btw, 'dmidecode -t memory' has banks 0 based... maybe that means your output is too
<peetaur2>	so for example "Locator: P1_DIMM1A" is super clear which port it is, and then it maps that to "Bank Locator: BANK0" which I guess means that if your output says 0, then it's P1_DIMM1A (which is labeld in plain text on the board)
<pingfloyd>	MonkehParade: why do you say that?
<phear>	yo
<phear>	what's up guys, im having issues rn, can somebody help?
<peetaur2>	MonkehParade: perhaps it is a result of people having interest getting jobs with it and then losing interest; find someone who got a job that is not coding, and they are more likely to maintain their enthusiasm
<phear>	http://codelite.org/LiteEditor/Repositories trying to add these FUCKING repos to install codelite
<phear>	i'm on mint, added trusty universe and it's not working for shit
<phear>	i did it manually apt-add-repo, now its saying i have broken repos to
<peetaur2>	phear: the CLI for that stuff is brain dead broken, so you should just manually edit /etc/sources.d/somefile.list and add the key too
<phear>	how do i uninstall the repos and start fresh and also get this working?
<phear>	fuck seriously LOL
<phear>	how do i uninstall all these repos then
<peetaur2>	add to the .list file, then "apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys ..."
<phear>	i just want to clean up now
<phear>	and start fresh
<peetaur2>	look in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/  for the stuff you already added
<madghost>	hi all
<peetaur2>	back up /etc/apt if you want to be safe
<phear>	is it in uh
<madghost>	is there someone who did public WiFi hotspot ?
<phear>	additional-repositories.list probably
<phear>	eh?
<phear>	oh yea
<Vimar>	Hi pals
<fujiao>	i tried to limit /tmp with tmpfs   /tmp    tmpfs   nosuid,size=400M        0       0, but if i do `du -h``within /tmp it shows sizes above 400M. e.g. it display 614M or 1.3 GB. how come that?
<phear>	how do i remove that key
<phear>	where would sudo apt-key adv --fetch-keys http://repos.codelite.org/CodeLite.asc
<phear>	 be saved?
<`\\\`>	HOWDY, VIMAR
<fujiao>	whereas df -h shows "tmpfs                                                 400M  400M  428K 100% /tmp"
<RingtailedFox>	whats the proper way to add a shoutcast server to the list of services/daemons ina server?  symlink in /etc/?
<peetaur2>	phear: heh never had to remove a key... but you can try strace on apt-key to see what files it looks at, and maybe just read the man page to see if it can list and remove them too
<phear>	okkk
<phear>	thanks peetaur2
<madghost>	who knows ? it will be work some apps through Squid proxy, like a play market, app store, facebook and so on...  ?
<proprietarysucks>	RingtailedFox, the best way to add anything to services is to use the built in way for your distro
<RingtailedFox>	ehh, there's no pre-built package for shoutcast server
<peetaur2>	fujiao: does    mount | grep tmp   show your size option?
<pagios>	when we pipe | are we redirecting the stdout by default to the pipe or stdout+stderr?
<proprietarysucks>	RingtailedFox, certainly your distribution has procedures for adding services, what distro?
<RingtailedFox>	mageia
<peetaur2>	pagios: use    >wherever 2>&1   or if you're brave   &> wherever   to get both
<peetaur2>	(I found &> is unreliable on some places... maybe it was FreeBSD)
<fujiao>	peetaur2, yes it does: "tmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,relatime,size=409600k)
<fujiao>	"
<RingtailedFox>	mageia 4, to be precise
<proprietarysucks>	never heard of it
<proprietarysucks>	but basically what you can do is find the other services and there should be some template service files you can copy
<RingtailedFox>	it's a fork of mandriva/manrake
*	RingtailedFox nods
<proprietarysucks>	the general idea is usually that you inherit various functions and build the same script around your process, which runs with daemon command
<proprietarysucks>	then you (might) have another command which will automatically configure the runlevel-type of functionality of that script
<proprietarysucks>	chkconfig, update-rc.d or whatever it's called on deb
<madghost>	Squid proxy server is only for WEB proxy, or other applications can work through it ?
<proprietarysucks>	systemctl on newer red hats
<RingtailedFox>	we have chkconfig
<proprietarysucks>	madghost, it's primarily for web but also does things like ftp and so on
<RingtailedFox>	and systemctl
<proprietarysucks>	then you'll want systemctl enable servicename
<proprietarysucks>	but you'll need to build the file it wants first: consult the docs for systemctl for the exact method
<proprietarysucks>	the enable keyword will build the appropriate symlink for you
<madghost>	proprietarysucks: if I connect with Android to wifi and go into Internet through Squid, will be work apps like Play market, Facebook and so on?
<fujiao>	peetaur2, looks like rhel & opensuse use /dev/shm additionally to /tmp, so i think i have to limit shm too: http://dpaste.com/2R2QGVA
<phear>	W: GPG error: http://download.opensuse.org  Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 5A7D1D38BEB6D886
<phear>	 how do i get rid of this gaddam msg when i get done updating
<madghost>	if I all packets redirect to Squid port ?
<phear>	tried to del the key
<madghost>	with iptables ?
<peetaur2>	phear: this is on debian/ubuntu and it says opensuse.org?
<phear>	yes wtf?
<peetaur2>	phear: grep -R opensuse.org /etc/apt
<phear>	kk
<proprietarysucks>	madghost, your squid config is important to understand

<survietamine>	hello, how do you get ipv4 addresses from your linux boxes? I am currently parsing output of $(ip -o -f inet a) but I don't know if there is a short way
<proprietarysucks>	ip addr, ifconfig are some ways
<proprietarysucks>	facter
<survietamine>	yeah, it is ip addr in my example
<survietamine>	I tried hostname -i, but in some cases it is not good when /etc/hosts is not properly set
<viscera>	peetaur2: must be that new-fangled OBS
<proprietarysucks>	how do you determine what your IP address is?
<proprietarysucks>	on a system that has a few, for example
<survietamine>	as I wrote, I'm interested by all
<survietamine>	so, I do a loop on ip -o -f inet a
<survietamine>	but I was wondering if there is another (shorter) way
<proprietarysucks>	survietamine, ifconfig | awk '/inet/ {print $2}' ??
<survietamine>	nah, I don't still use ifconfig
<survietamine>	anyway it is no more available on my systems
<proprietarysucks>	what a crappy system
<survietamine>	not crappy, just not using deprecated stuff
*	Encapsulation is now known as 77CAAR2ZA
<proprietarysucks>	ip addr | awk '/inet/ {print $2}' will give you the same with cidr
<survietamine>	man
<survietamine>	I already manage with iproute
<proprietarysucks>	ok so sounds like you got what you want
<survietamine>	yeah, I just wanted to know if there is another way/tool/command
<survietamine>	that I don't know about
<survietamine>	but thank you for answering
<naptr>	i'm confused about the default MTA settings in /etc/defaults/rc.conf
<naptr>	sendmail_enabile="no" however we have sendmail_outbound_nable="yes" and sendmail_submit_enable="yes"
<naptr>	do either of those "yes" matter if sendmail_enable="no" ?
<peetaur2>	naptr: freebsd?
<naptr>	doh :/
<naptr>	peetaur2: thx.
<peetaur2>	btw, don't use sendmail :D it's obsolete junk
<naptr>	hehe, agreed, but, it's default on freebsd, and, i at least want it to keep giving me root's mail.
<peetaur2>	I could also say switch to linux, but that is more subjective than saying sendmail is junk
<naptr>	linux won't do what i need that machine to do.
*	peetaur2 uses FreeBSD only for zfs
<naptr>	otherwise, it would be a slack box for sure. =)
<naptr>	haha, right, it's ZFS. =)
<peetaur2>	btw is this typo also in the conf?   "sendmail_outbound_nable"
<naptr>	nope, i thought i'd correct it here, but, then, i chose not to. =P
<_user>	hello
<_user>	how can i find string in text file
<_user>	?
<revere>	heh
<survietamine>	_user: with grep?
<revere>	this book I'm reading claims open source software like firefox, apache and even linux are mainly written by volunteers
<_user>	ahh grep
<_user>	yea :)
<survietamine>	_user: grep for "simple" cases
<_user>	okay i get it
<_user>	surv what flag show me in what line is that string ?
<GPenguin>	_user: learn to use man pages
<_user>	GPenguin
<_user>	i know to use man pages
<_user>	but grep is not only for reading strings from text file
<_user>	so man is long
<_user>	so for what i must read this all if somebody can tell me this faster ?
*	GPenguin shrugs
<_user>	read to dont be asshole
<revere>	user please
<survietamine>	_user: man grep| less -p "--line-number"
<revere>	It takes just a little while to learn what you want and you can use it yourself for the rest of your life
<_user>	thanks
<revere>	If we keep telling you snippets you won't learn a thing
<revere>	Give a man a fish etc
<_user>	revere
<_user>	give you a break
<revere>	what?
<_user>	give youself a break
<_user>	dont attack me and fuck off
<_user>	easy
<_user>	man
<revere>	are you from india?
<revere>	you sound like you do
<_user>	nope im not
<_user>	im going, thanks surv, cya revere
<WildPikachu>	_user, revere , maybe you two can take it pvt? not in here please
*	revere throws a master ball at WildPikachu
*	WildPikachu ducks
*	revere horses
<Ajacobsson>	The irony in telling people to not be assholes while being rude and demanding
<GPenguin>	my fault. i started with the wrong tone
<BlackPanx>	how does physical sector and block size corelate ?
<revere>	I mean if an user barges is commanding someone to tell him how to do something as trivial as grepping a simple file I think he is in the wrong place
<revere>	It's easier to fire up a new tab than connect to IRC
<BlackPanx>	physical sector is sector on disk that is hardware specific, while block size is the one you can manipulate and can vary
<BlackPanx>	if i'm correct
<balooo>	hello everyone
<revere>	what do you want balooo
*	argoneus is now known as Leon75
<survietamine>	to say hello :)
<balooo>	I've having trouble understanding why when I do an 'lsof -i'  i see all my java processes connecting externally with 'TYPE'  'ipv6',  when I do not have any ipv6 routing in place?   This is running on an ubuntu server.  Does anyone know why that be?
<balooo>	*I'm having*
*	Leon75 is now known as argoneus
<revere>	Perhaps there's ipv6 on the internal network?
<balooo>	The java process is connecting to external processes running in a different DC
<balooo>	e.g. java     19673 service   71u  IPv6 29430984      0t0  TCP ip-10-50-151-72.internal:19965->10.50.153.152:9042 (ESTABLISHED) java     19673 service   72u  IPv6 29429359      0t0  TCP ip-10-50-151-72.internal:19966->10.50.153.152:9042 (ESTABLISHED)
<survietamine>	isn't that a java question?
<survietamine>	did you disable ipv6 with sysctl?
<balooo>	I don't think so, because I think it's related to how the host is setup.  I could tell the java process to forcefully use ipv4,  but that's not really what i'm trying to figure out.
<balooo>	ipv6 isn't disabled as far as I know, because some other things use it (ntp i think)
<survietamine>	I don't know java, but maybe if ipv6 is enabled on the host, it tries to use it.
<balooo>	I'm just not sure how it's using ipv6 for ipv4 addresses,  the connections must be ipv4 still right?  I'm basically trying to diagnose if the occasional read timeouts we are getting are caused by this or not.  I personally don't think this is the cause, because I would have thought we'd get connection timeout issue if it was related to a problem with ipv6 v ipv4 and we're only getting read timeouts
<rtb>	wrt to zcat foo | file ... is that pipeline lazy or does the entire file have to be piped in before file decides? i tested with a 10M file and 1G file and they 'seem' (not measured) to take the same time
<balooo>	I guess I just don't get why lsof is saying the type is ipv6
<survietamine>	yeah, without ipv6 to ipv4 tunnel, it looks weird, but I am newbie
<deniska>	rtb: pipelines are entirely parallel, all programs start simultenously
<rtb>	deniska, thanks.
<deniska>	and file usually can decide filetype on the first few bytes
<rtb>	so if a component of the pipeline exits then all other programs must stop .. right?
*	Sarge123^off is now known as Sarge123
<deniska>	yes
<survietamine>	balooo: ah, I have same behaviours mon my mail servers
<rtb>	deniska, thanks
<survietamine>	balooo: are you sure it is just lsof's output, doesn't a command like ss output ipv6 too?
<Unopoo>	when installing centOS6.6 to vbox, I skipped network configuration accidentally, now after I entered the fresh centOS6.6, I'm not connected to internet, and when do a ifconfig, there is only one `lo` record
<balooo>	ss shows ipv6 addresses too but they all start with ffff which i think means they're ipv4 mapped addresses
<survietamine>	balooo: yeah
<clarkk>	how do I find the unix domain socket for my local postgres server, please?
<peetaur2>	clarkk: lsof -Pn -p $pidofpostgres
<peetaur2>	or just   lsof -Pn | grep -E "postgres.*sock" or whatever lazier alternative
<clarkk>	thanks peetaur2
<autrilla>	How can I check if my email server is using a certificate to connect to other servers?
<peetaur2>	autrilla: don't assume anything; use gpg
<autrilla>	Huh?
<autrilla>	I'm relaying mail through Office 365 and one day it suddenly stopped working, and the auth is done via a certificate, I just want to check if my server is still providing the cert
<peetaur2>	you can force it to encrypt mail between you and your server, and your friend can too, but you don't have any guarantee or way to audit whether your server encrypts when relaying it to your friend's server. So if you use GPG instead, it won't matter... the mail is not encrypted on any server, only on each client.
<MrElendig>	you tell your server to be verbose in the logging
<MrElendig>	or you wireshark all the things!
<MrElendig>	too bad S/MIME is a mess btw :(
<autrilla>	peetaur2, the idea is not encrypting mail, but authenticating my server is who it says it is
<peetaur2>	any ssl/tls connection should do that...
<peetaur2>	sorta ;)
<MrElendig>	autrilla: that is waht dkip etc is for
<MrElendig>	dkim*
<autrilla>	Office 365 wants a cert
<MrElendig>	http://www.dkim.org/
<peetaur2>	SSL is a very broken concept, in that your mail client already imported a huge number of certificate authorities; your client will make sure that some authority certifies it, but if the CA suddenly changes to some one that made a bogus certificate, it won't let you know.
<MrElendig>	if you are talking about server<->server comm
<MrElendig>	anyway, just tell all the things to be verbose and log debug info
<autrilla>	This has nothing to do with clients peetaur2
<MrElendig>	and then see what is really going on
<peetaur2>	well since you have said contradictory things (" my email server ... to connect to other servers" and "but authenticating my server") I'll just give up
<autrilla>	smtp is verbose, I don't see anything about certificates here https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8c2c5194559c5669f96e
<autrilla>	peetaur2, so? Email servers authenticate themselves often, how else would the Office 365's Exchange server know it's me?
<autrilla>	By verifying that the subject name on the certificate that the sending server uses to authenticate with Office 365 matches this domain name (recommended)
<autrilla>	So, postfix should be using TLS with my cert, I just want to check that
<lovetruth>	hello people
<lovetruth>	I keep getting this error... how can I debug it?...               it's      Caused by: LDAPException(resultCode=49 (invalid credentials), errorMessage='invalid credentials')
<MrElendig>	context missing
<lovetruth>	MrElendig: it's zimbra. Exactly like on https://community.zimbra.com/collaboration/f/1886/t/1138688
<lovetruth>	after forced restart, this error...
<MrElendig>	go talk to the zimbra people then
<lovetruth>	tried... no one answers
<autrilla>	Is this bad?  Untrusted TLS connection established to favega-com.mail.protection.outlook.com[213.199.154.87]:25: TLSv1.2 with cipher ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384 (256/256 bits)
<lovetruth>	I'm guessing the protocol is wrong
<lovetruth>	or somewhere it scrambles the auth to ldap
<lovetruth>	it was listening to 636 only, at first
<lovetruth>	I enabled 389 too, and few more services were starting now
<lovetruth>	but it said credentials wrong
<shadok>	autrilla: check if you have a full cert chain to the CA, it seems you don't or the cert is self-signed
<autrilla>	shadok, I don't have the root CA, is it needed for mail?
<autrilla>	Because HTTP servers don't need it
<eirirs>	jesus, bless me
<autrilla>	I really feel like the problem is on Microsoft's side, mainly because it worked and suddenly stopped working without me touching anything, and also because they provide authentication using the stmp sender's IP address, which also doesn't work.
<eirirs>	what's stmp :P
<eirirs>	that just sounds like something incorrectly setup
<autrilla_>	eirirs, are you seriously asking what SMTP is?

<eleventh>	I like kde 5 lxqt and i3
<eleventh>	Depending on what useage i have for it
<baldfat>	eleventh: Well those are mine :) I still like Windows 8 more than any other Windows or OSX desktop
<viscera>	osx has a 3rd party app available that gives win7-like window management
<ayecee>	mistry: no ideas here
<viscera>	it's pretty good
<eleventh>	Baldfat: have you tried win 10? If I have to run windows i rather likeit
<viscera>	but yeah out of the box it's a pain
<freeroute>	I want to download every file with .tar.gz in its filename (using wget) on this website: https://files.dyne.org/tomb/ - I tried wget 'https://files.dyne.org/tomb/*tar.gz*' but that failed. How can I do this?
<baldfat>	eleventh: Yes I have tested out whatever Windows 10 is now. I disagree with many decisions in UI since I hate Mouse Driven UI
<baldfat>	freeroute: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8755229/how-to-download-all-files-but-no-html-from-a-website-using-wget
<eleventh>	Baldfat: i agree i run i3 with lxqt normally but have to run a windows vm for work.
<eleventh>	Some .mil sites have ie7 dependencies and I need acrobat 11 for smart card signatures
<baldfat>	eleventh: I am sorry. I still am amazed that I get to use OpenSUSE in my Non-Profit Corp. The it department is 100% MS and no Linux experience at all
<baldfat>	eleventh: Why not use Wine or Crossover for that? Crossover does ie7 well
<visceral>	baldfat: activex?
<peetaur2>	baldfat: in what way do you use it? just on the desktop, or on all the servers and every machine you maintain?
*	visceral is now known as viscera
*	peetaur2 used openSUSE for 15 or so years but switched away due to systemd
<viscera>	peetaur2: to?
<eleventh>	Baldfat: unfortunately adobe 11 is not yet supported by wine
<baldfat>	I use it on Desktop. I have to interface with a MS DB but that is very easy these days
<peetaur2>	viscera: manjaro-openrc
*	Psi-Jack cringes at openrc.
<baldfat>	<--- Loves SystemD
<peetaur2>	openrc is basically just modern sysv ... nothing to cringe about
<eleventh>	Arch on my laptop. Fedora on desktop and centos7 on home server
<Psi-Jack>	That's 100% of everything to cringe about, :p
<baldfat>	eleventh: Reader XI runs on Crossover
<baldfat>	https://www.codeweavers.com/compatibility/crossover/adobe-reader-xi
<eleventh>	Baldfat: t/m I'll look into it
<eleventh>	G2g
<pid1>	freeroute, uGet would work well for that, though I'm sure there is a non-GUI solution.
<freeroute>	baldfat & pid1 I'm currently messing around with some setting, I forgot that in that directory there's also a subdir with old versions (https://files.dyne.org/tomb/old-releases/) and wget traverses that, so I'll have to mess around with --level
<freeroute>	I'm sure I'll get the hang of it at some point
<baldfat>	freeroute: You can also look at aria2c
<viscera>	baldfat: if you love it, spell it correctly :0 http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/
<watmm>	Looking for recommendations on statistics gathering for mysql. Stuff like what what query types execute the most, and take up the most processing time.
<Voyage>	how to chmod rwxrwxr-x
<freeroute>	baldfat: I'm almost there with wget - http://kpaste.net/da9 - the only thing that I have to do is to only download the Tomb* files
<peetaur2>	Voyage: man chmod ... that's easy
<watmm>	775
<freeroute>	(so without the above folder
<freeroute>	)
<shaggycat>	Voyage, may be for you can be more easy: chmod a+rwx FILE ; chmod u+rx; chmod g=w
<baldfat>	freeroute: I almost always use aria2c due to the speed. to do what you want in aria2c I make a file of the links and just go aria2c -i text.txt
<Voyage>	shaggycat,  peetaur2  hm
<baldfat>	freeroute: works with ISO, meta links, bottorrent or simple downloads
<shaggycat>	Voyage, first add r, w, x permitions for file, second add for user owner, and therd set to group write permition (whithout r unusable)
<shaggycat>	also, you can read man 2 chmod
<shaggycat>	Voyage, for understand permitons
<shaggycat>	*permitions
<freeroute>	baldfat: right, but aria2c isn't included in most distros (I choose wget for portability purposes). How would you do what I want in aria2c though? In my case I want to download the latest Tomb archive and its .asc and .sha signature from that link.
<shaggycat>	Anybody have skills in openvswitch?
<baldfat>	freeroute: I put the links into a text file. I am super nerdy and I use w3m to grab the links and just copy them into a text file in vim. Take 5 seconds than aria2c -i text.txt. Also I always find aria2c in OpenSUSE, Ubuntu and Arch Linux
<Voyage>	shaggycat,  peetaur2  my magento installation says Path "/var/www/html/projects/hamptongems/1/app/etc" must be writable.       but it is...  :/var/www/html/projects/hamptongems/1/app/etc$ ls -la
<Voyage>	drwxrwsr-x 3 pm1 developer-group 4096 Apr 29 08:25 .
<peetaur2>	Voyage: but is the user that needs write permission either pm1 or in developer-group?
<baldfat>	freeroute: I am just saying what is convient for me. I never have to worry about if it is a bittorrent, metalink or andthing else.
<Voyage>	peetaur2,  yes. apache runs by www-data and it is a member of developer-group
<peetaur2>	Voyage: test it with:    sudo -u www-data touch /var/www/html/projects/hamptongems/1/app/etc/rwtestfile
<freeroute>	baldfat: but in this case Tomb-2.0.1.tar.gz could be Tomb-2.0.2.tar.gz tomorrow, I want to make a script which for example says "Download Tomb-*.tar.gz* inside that link and do not recurse further". This way I am always sure to download the latest stable version from the source.
<Voyage>	peetaur2,  what will happen by this command?
<freeroute>	baldfat: it undoubtedly is convenient for some stuff, but in this case some regex has to be specified in order to run scripted
<Voyage>	peetaur2,  touch: cannot touch '/var/www/html/projects/hamptongems/1/app/etc/rwtestfile': Permission denied
<freeroute>	(unless I'm not understanding something of course)
<baldfat>	freeroute: I would just write a scraper to grab the tar files and copy them to a text file
<Voyage>	peetaur2,  I also did this: sudo chgrp -R developer-group /var/www/html/projects/hamptongems
<Voyage>	sudo find /var/www/html/projects/hamptongems -type d -exec chmod g=rwxs "{}" \;
<Voyage>	sudo find /var/www/html/projects/hamptongems -type f -exec chmod g=rws  "{}" \;
<Voyage>	 it is...  :/var/www/html/projects/hamptongems/1/app/etc$ ls -la
<Voyage>	drwxrwsr-x 3 pm1 developer-group 4096 Apr 29 08:25 .
<Voyage>	strange. isnt it peetaur2 ?
<Voyage>	wait.
<ayecee>	Voyage: is www-data a member of developer-group?
<Voyage>	www-data is not in the group of devs
<ayecee>	ah.
<Voyage>	ya, thats what I just checked
<Voyage>	Is it normal for linux the delete users from groups when explicitly added by humans?
<ayecee>	no
<baldfat>	Voyage: spam?
<Voyage>	baldfat,  what spam?
<baldfat>	Voyage: you might need to use a paste site for your examples and paste the link :)
<ayecee>	Voyage: it's also not normal to add www-data to groups.
<ayecee>	but that's beside the point.
<freeroute>	baldfat: cool, I'll check it out, I'm still nooby at writing scripting languages but I'll remember this example for my practice later. In my current case though this works as well: wget --accept tar.gz,.tar.gz.asc,.tar.gz.sha --recursive --level=1 --no-parent --no-directories https://files.dyne.org/tomb/

<baldfat>	freeroute: The beauty of Open Source and Linux is options. You can find what you like and use it. You always get to refine your work flow. Persoanlly I would scrap a website and make a text file since I can do that in seconds. You might find bash or python or ML even better for you
<Voyage>	peetaur2,  I just added www-data to developer-group and able to touch by your command. still getting that message...
<peetaur2>	Voyage: you mean sudo -u ... touch works, but the webapp doesn't?
<peetaur2>	Voyage: are you sure it's apache you need to check, and not php-fpm or some other thing?
<Voyage>	peetaur2,  yes. sudo -r
<peetaur2>	I dunno what -r is.... what is role? :D
<Voyage>	peetaur2,  hm. how to be sure?
<peetaur2>	Voyage: add a "whoami" or echo $$ sort of thing, and then use ps to find out who owns the process

<freeroute>	peetaur2: thanks, lots of sedness that I still have to grep, but this looks pretty solid, thanks :)
<peetaur2>	this is apache, but how do you know that apache directly runs that command that fails?
<peetaur2>	freeroute: no prob
<freeroute>	baldfat: yeah I'll definitely try python some day, although in terms of scripting langs I've set my time priority to learning Node.
<freeroute>	(which means JS)
<ronhandler>	power
<baldfat>	freeroute: Simple tutorial http://www.joyofdata.de/blog/using-linux-shell-web-scraping/  Personally I don't use Python for scripting much anymore
<baldfat>	freeroute: I wouldn't see javascript as a system scripting language since java script drives me nutty :)
<peetaur2>	I wouldn't either, because sanity.
<freeroute>	yeah it doesn't have that fine syntax like python or ruby, but it's damn near everywhere these days
<freeroute>	btw baldfat that's a pretty cool example
<baldfat>	For scripting on linux i have learned to love bash, awk and sed. Learning sed is simple, bash moderate and awk is a language
<baldfat>	fish is also nice but ..
*	peetaur2 only uses sed for s/.../.../
<freeroute>	bash is moderate?
<freeroute>	ok :|
<peetaur2>	bash is great for commands and pipes, and lousy for anything with data structure beyond strings and arrays and simple hashmaps, or performance, or safety unless you're really careful (no exception handling)
<peetaur2>	awk does simple text files way better
<peetaur2>	python, etc. anything with real classes and data structures for everything else
<toothe>	remember when perl was the go-to language for web programming?
<toothe>	now when I see perl I think "how badly can I hack this?"
<bls>	web programming is more about fads than sound technology decisions
<peetaur2>	perl was only the web language for small time nerdery and not professional
<toothe>	bls: Totally disagree...
<bls>	what's the JS framework of the day? what new language bolted onto the JVM are people raving about now that'll be discarded in 6 months?
<efdee>	not sure if this is a good place to ask, but.. i have a beefy linux server (32GB ram, 3TB disk) that i want to use to host a bunch of VMs on for development purposes. i'm looking for a decent setup to maintain those VMs. any recommendations?
<bls>	heh, for certain values of beefy

<baldfat>	bls: Web programming is the worlds biggest hack
<zorak8>	i want to delete some files but keep the names of the files, how can i do that"
<zorak8>	?
<zorak8>	like, only delete the content of the file
<bls>	zorak8: truncate them
<booboy>	if they are text files you can cat /dev/null >> filename
<baldfat>	bash and awka dn sed can do so much mroe than people think and jump to python to soon. IMHO http://datascienceatthecommandline.com/
<zorak8>	like this >| file ?
<sarthor>	Hi, I have extracted .jar file to some folder (some folders and file extracted) and then have made some changes in some images files. Now I want to create .jar file again. How can I do that? HELP please.
<booboy>	cat /dev/null > filename
<baldfat>	efdee: It sounds like docker or rocket would be your best bet right now. I like rocket more than coreos dockers in terms of seperation
<bls>	depends on whether you want VMs or containers
<baldfat>	sarthor: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/build.html
<baldfat>	bls: You are correct. Sorry I have been in the fad of liking containers more. Though vagrant has been a great tool for my server
<sarthor>	baldfat, Thank you dear. (-_-)
<bls>	baldfat: the lines are being blurred but a lot of it depends on the management model. I've been reading "bad things" about people trying to poke into containers to manage things in them internally like a VM when they should have just been using a VM in the first place
<zorak8>	trying to do this loop but im getting an error
<zorak8>	for f in . ; do cat /dev/null > $f ; done
<Delf>	Any easy way of using the phone's light sensor to automatically adjust the computer screen's brightness using ddcc?
<bls>	zorak8: . is a directory, not a file
<baldfat>	bls: That is 100% correct. I use vagrant for programming in my cloud. I use containers for deployment
<zorak8>	said that . is a directory, off course is a directory
<klync>	i've been seeing a weird dns problem lately, and as best I can tell, it seems to be this, although I haven't found anything online that validates this theory: some recursive dns servers (like the one inside my dd-wrt router) will fail to return an answer when recursively looking up an "A" record, when the answer is an rfc1918 address. Unfortunately, I have a domain with public records where there is a mix of
<zorak8>	i want to loop in each file in the directory i am
<klync>	 public and private addresses; the public ones all work though, and the private ones only fail for certain people (i.e. not our main office)
<bls>	zorak8: for f in *; do ...; done
<ayecee>	or ./*
<baldfat>	klync: Did you do a traceroute to confirm?
<zorak8>	thanks!
<klync>	baldfat: dig shows me exactly what I described above ^^
<klync>	baldfat: if your home router does dns proxying, I can give you examples to see the problem via pm, if you'd like :D
<Fenikkusu>	I realize this is a bit off topic, but given the underlying system I thought I would ask. I've got an iMac 2010 that I just bought a brand new hard drive and installed a couple weeks ago. I did this because the previous harddrive suddenly needed a repair, but diskutil was unable to repair it. Last night, the same thing happened again on the new harddrive. Does anyone have any thoughts on why
<Fenikkusu>	this might be?

<ayecee>	zorak8: quote the expansion
<reisio>	zorak8: what're you loopin' through?
<baldfat>	Fenikkusu: This is why most people HATE the OS X file system HTF+

<reisio>	baldfat: what is?

<Fenikkusu>	baldfat, why is that? I personally haven't had any issues with it since I original got the computer.

<baldfat>	Fenikkusu: I do have a HUGE anti-Apple bias since the 1980s and their lying but HTF+ is the worst file system for any OS currently being used. Just do a HTF+ worst or bad file system you'll see a ton of stuff to read about it
<reisio>	I have a huge one since my brain works

<baldfat>	I still don't understand why Apple walked away from ZFS?
<Remram>	Voyage: histfile has a size limit

<holybladder>	Hi all
<reisio>	baldfat: they didn't make it, so they can't possibly use it
<peetaur2>	baldfat: apple is all about braindead simplicity at the cost of usefulness... why would they want to support zfs? :D
<reisio>	baldfat: not enough brushed metal or intermediary state between C and C++
<reisio>	also they have a pathetic server market share
<reisio>	probably because Mac OS is about as secure is a dump in public
<peetaur2>	oh good point, only a few enthusiasts put zfs on the desktop
<reisio>	holybladder: heyo
<reisio>	secure as*
<reisio>	moreover, Mac OS users like Mac OS because they hate both choices and thinking :)

<peetaur2>	no need to apologize... you are a victim too; stupid link tracking
<reisio>	peetaur2: agreed
<reisio>	baldfat: all I get from that is that there are people who simultaneously want choices and like Mac OS (that is, there are crazy people)
<reisio>	but y'know what they say about "journalists" who don't write tripe
<reisio>	"RIP"
<baldfat>	reisio: But Apple offical announced that ZFS was coming to Snow Leopard than boom
<reisio>	well we already knew they were clowns, right?
<peetaur2>	baldfat: license issue? that basically just says they made a logic error "to replace usage of HFS+ in one place requires it to be COMPLETELY GONE" and a laziness, no license issue
<peetaur2>	also it reminds me of systemd when it says     "What TC didn't expect though was that Apple's kernel engineers would hardwire HFS+ into their core technologies and applications, ..., making it impractical to fully replace HFS+. "

<treaki>		Physical Sector size:                  4096 bytes
<treaki>	what dose it mean, is it adviced to switch to 4096 bytes logicial sector size if so how to do that?
<treaki>	reisio, because it isnt and i need to write files on it :)
<peetaur2>	treaki: just align all starts of partitions to a multiple of 2048 sectors

BUT if i have an opened session and use this command foreman ... he working fine
<MrElendig>	Kobrakao: use full path
<reisio>	the command 'foreman' alone?
<peetaur2>	Kobrakao: use absolute path, or set your $PATH better; things like .profile /etc/environment, /etc/profile.d, and so on all behave differently depending on what type of shell you are using
<treaki>	peetaur2, ok, than i have to deal with that... dose this have. are there any disatvantages about such a difference in logical and physical sector size, should i have a closer look when buying my next hdd?
<peetaur2>	Kobrakao: maybe using -T or -t will work around it
<peetaur2>	ssh -t that is
<Kobrakao>	. /var/* its absolute path no?
<bls>	Kobrakao: no
<survietamine>	Kobrakao: I think he meant for "foreman run"
<peetaur2>	Kobrakao: you have to do ./foreman or /somewhere/hopefully/usr/(local/?)bin/foreman
<rattking>	or maybe ./foreman after the cd ?
<survietamine>	Kobrakao: because error message is "foreman: command not found"

<survietamine>	Kobrakao: or maybe with ssh... bash -c "you commands"
<treaki>	Kobrakao, the reason is the different system enviorment, maybe the path variable is only set by a full shell and not by ssh itself. you can check all scripts which are run by your session creation relatet to PATH and than find out...

<baldfat>	Kobrakao: Also don't EVER post an actual IP address for a server with the user name even :P
<MrElendig>	rtb: stardict is the obvious one
<reisio>	parted -s /dev/correctDevice mklabel msdos; parted -s /dev/correctDevice mkpart primary fat32 0% 100%; mkdosfs /dev/correctDevice1; dosfslabel /dev/correctDevice1 potato
<treaki>	same error as before
<treaki>	Error: partition length of 6837473280 sectors exceeds the msdos-partition-table-imposed maximum of 4294967295
<Kobrakao>	not real :P
<Kobrakao>	its a prank the data
<treaki>	is there a possibility to switch to a higher sector size of the disk lable?
<clarjon1>	a 'prank'
<clarjon1>	riight.
<rtb>	thanks MrElendig btw is the project defunt now? going by the contents at this page http://stardict.sourceforge.net/
<rattking>	rtb: aspell or ispell
<Kobrakao>	can be another server.. i don't know.. jejejej
<bls>	I use the dict command from plan9port
<rattking>	duh dictionary.. I need to read better.. NM
<rtb>	:)
<treaki>	reisio, peetaur2, is there a way to set the sector size of the disk lable to dive around this problem??
<reisio>	treaki: you tried the commands I just said?
*	unreal_ is now known as unreal
<peetaur2>	treaki: just make sure the start sector of each partition is divisible by 2048 and it'll be fine without any more work
*	Xiti is now known as Pixi
<peetaur2>	to print sectors:   parted /dev/sdX unit s print

<sleezio>	hello, does anyone know why google earth street view goes crazy when you try to look above 45 degrees? i've tried both regualr GE and pro, problem is on both and it happens on both xubuntu/linux mint
<reisio>	probably just because it's crappy software made by clowns, but let's see...
<MaxFrames>	hello
<MaxFrames>	I have a problem wiping a hdd, forgive if the question will look lame, I'm doing my best... upon connecting it, it appears unpartitioned, but if (in windows) I try to create a volume and format it, I get an error "unable to format" and suddenly an ext3 partition appears
<MaxFrames>	the contents can even be read in windows! (I have an ext* driver installed) so there is actually data on the hdd
<sleezio>	MaxFrames, are you using gpart?
<baldfat>	I still love gparted for partitions
<rtb>	MrElendig, installed the sdcv but where do i get the actual dictionary from? any idea
<MaxFrames>	if I plug it to a linux machine, and try to wipe the partition with gparted, it seems to succeed
<MrElendig>	rtb: google
<Voyage>	Remram,  ya but my commands were in dozens only
<MaxFrames>	but in facts, when I try to plug it back to windows, the cycle repeats
<MrElendig>	rtb: there are quite a few dictionaries available online, of varying legality
<MaxFrames>	can't create a new ntfs partition, the ext3 partition comes back, data are still there....
<MaxFrames>	it's the ext3 partition from hell!
<MaxFrames>	fwis, when I plug the disk in lubuntu I get this error:
<rattking>	you could try 'wipefs -a' on that drive
<MaxFrames>	error mounting /dev/sdc1.... wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdc1
<rtb>	MrElendig, googled a bit. the ones linked on the sdcv page on archwiki point to nowhere. looks like no quick answer to this :). thanks though
<MaxFrames>	rattking: the drive is seen by gparted as /dev/sdc
<MaxFrames>	can you give me the correct syntax? I'm not a linux expert
<MaxFrames>	wipefs -a /dev/sdc?
<reisio>	sleezio: on mine it doesn't do much useful at any angle, heh
<rattking>	I would start with any partitions on sdc first
<sleezio>	reisio, thanks, at least i know it isn't just me
<MaxFrames>	woah... I have to take back one thing, windows (via ext2fs driver) thinks it's ext3 but it looks like it's really ext4
<reisio>	sleezio: it was flat, hit the person/house button and it works now
<reisio>	sleezio: the sky is choppy, probably suffering from a lack of pixels and made up fantasyland google added to make it look less empty
<reisio>	if it's real choppy your graphics driver/display might be going normally crazy over it
<reisio>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern
<sleezio>	reisio, use mose, try to look up the side of a building(whatever), does screen go crazy when you reach a certain height?
<sleezio>	reisio, it's doing the same thing on 2 seperate boxes, 2 seperate vidcards
<reisio>	mose?
<sleezio>	*move
<sleezio>	ugh
<sleezio>	mouse
<reisio>	oh ouse
<reisio>	moussseeee
<MaxFrames>	mm, looks like all must be done within gparted... i wanted to create the ntfs volume on windows, but gparted seems to have created it just fine
<reisio>	sleezio: like what building? (address)
<sleezio>	anywhere
<sleezio>	doesn't have to be a building
<sleezio>	just mouse up(look up)
<sleezio>	for me, it's like the screen starts spinning 500mph
<dearhawk2>	can you make a segment both executable and writable?
<reisio>	dearhawk2: segment?
<reisio>	sleezio: "anywhere", no I have no problem
<reisio>	sleezio: it does have terrible mouse coasting, though, in some situations
<reisio>	you have to click to stop it
<gaaara>	hello
<gaaara>	is possible to spoof flash version and Bypass flash player version check
<reisio>	hiyo
<reisio>	gaaara: yup
<sleezio>	i took a vid screenshot, letme upload it
<sleezio>	gimme a few
<dearhawk2>	reisio: want a text area in a process to be both writable and executable
<reisio>	dearhawk2: yeah, you can do that
<dearhawk2>	reisio: do you know how? :3
<reisio>	dearhawk2: for what language?
<dearhawk2>	c or c++
<MrElendig>	gaaara: why?
<reisio>	talk to ##C then
<reisio>	although they will probably hate the question :)
<sleezio>	reisio, it's only 6M(small) http://www.filedropper.com/test1_10
<gaaara>	i have a web site block the version of flash of linux
<reisio>	sleezio: what is?
<MrElendig>	gaaara: just don't use the outdated flashplugin
<reisio>	gaaara: you use firefox?
<MrElendig>	gaaara: use pepper flash
<gaaara>	yes
<sleezio>	reisio, i made a small vidcap
<gaaara>	is not compatible with drm
<sleezio>	video of google going crazy
<reisio>	gaaara: go to about:config, set extensions.blocklist.enabled to false
<MrElendig>	gaaara: there is a pepper -> npapi wrapper that lets you use pepper flash in firefox
<reisio>	gaaara: or use freshplayerplugin
<reisio>	or use sites that aren't crap :)
<compdoc>	I thought I read a post in a forum that its possible to add virus databases from other compaines like bitdefender to clamav. or maybe its i-cap. Anyone know?
<reisio>	compdoc: you can add anything to anything, with the right access
<compdoc>	phfft
<baldfat>	My Flash and flash plugins become a dead technology
<gaaara>	freshplayerplugin is compatible with flash drm ?
<MrElendig>	most virus defenition files are drm protected/encrypted
<reisio>	try #clamav
<baldfat>	compdoc: What are trying to do with your virus scanner?
<compdoc>	clamav misses a lot of attachments. Ive gotten 3 this morning
<shadok>	MrElendig: the problem is more a legal one thant a technical one then
<MrElendig>	shadok: both, since the formats varies *a lot*
<MrElendig>	shadok: many are not just plain defenitions, but actual code
<reisio>	compdoc: for example?
<MrElendig>	code/executables
<shadok>	compdoc: are you sure they are scanned? maybe their size is above the threshold ?
<baldfat>	compdoc: so you are scanning emails before doing what with them?
<treaki>	reisio, still not working, even with a command like yours: http://nopaste.linux-dev.org/?465006
<compdoc>	the entire emails with the attachments are 32k or so
<shadok>	MrElendig: i thought that more like yara signatures
<MrElendig>	clamav is horrible btw
<shadok>	MrElendig: i thought they were more like yara signatures*
*	anunnaki_ is now known as anunnaki
<baldfat>	compdoc: But why are you scanning emails? What purpose
<MrElendig>	with the wav
<MrElendig>	bha wrong channel
<reisio>	scanning emails is almost the only purpose of an av on unix
<dixie__>	reisio: 99% true.
<compdoc>	spamassassin and clamav
<reisio>	magic of 'almost'
<dixie__>	every so often there's something we need to be concerned about, but generally speaking av on linux is about protecting the poor microsofties.
<Remram>	emails delivered to that system, or coming out of that system, don't need an AV either
<reisio>	unlessen you got a worm eating your bandwidth
<reisio>	nothing fun like that has happened in ages, though
<dixie__>	there was that one time
<dixie__>	so I'm going to be performing some interesting terminal gymnastics this afternoon.  should be quite entertaining for those watching.
<ohcanada>	i think we can safely ssay that windows is almost secure
<rascul>	define "we"
<dixie__>	you know, 'secure' is a very funny word.
*	77CAAR2ZA is now known as Encapsulation
<reisio>	ohcanada: heheheh
<reisio>	such a magical word
<rumpel>	define "almost"
<shadok>	rumpel: or rather, define "secure" first
<rumpel>	shadok, no! almost!
<shadok>	ok you win :p
<reisio>	I'll define 'almost secure' instead: not secure
<baldfat>	ohcanada: in comparison to XP and 98 YES it is. In terms of actually someone wants into your machine and not some quick random script hack? Than your not secure
<theunixfreak>	hi, i use the realtek 8192ee wireless card and the rtlwifi driver, the net connection is very very buggy, anyone knows how to fix it?
<reisio>	theunixfreak: pretty sure the right driver for that is named 'rtl8192ee'
<treaki>	reisio, ok, now it is working, i fixt it using gpt disk lable...
<dixie__>	a while back my niece had a dude put his hands on her.  my dickless brother in law *knocked on his door* for 20 minutes and was very upset when he didn't come out.  Safe to say, that dude was pretty secure.  not entirely sure a locked door would have stopped me.
<reisio>	treaki: gj
<MrElendig>	theunixfreak: yes, get lots of weapons, go to the rtl headquaters, force them to start to actually write good drivers
<theunixfreak>	reisio: rtl8192ee was the old driver, now it is unified into rtlwifi
<MrElendig>	theunixfreak: tell them to make less buggy hardware too while you are at it
<theunixfreak>	MrElendig: I agree with you mate
<treaki>	but i have heared about a possibility to change the blocksize of msdos disk lable
<treaki>	do you know about that?
<reisio>	theunixfreak: says who?
<theunixfreak>	reisio: at least the kernel website
*	gattuso is now known as Guest2
<MrElendig>	theunixfreak: if that fails: http://arch.har-ikkje.net/gfx/ke.jpg
<reisio>	dixie__: could still pull it through by knocking 20 minutes every day
<reisio>	dixie__: but a good beating would be faster
<reisio>	theunixfreak: not the kernel website I looked at
<reisio>	theunixfreak: link?
<ohcanada>	reisio is correct. almost secure means not secure. because when you are talking security, a miss is as good as a mile
<reisio>	MrElendig: oh I like this...
<dixie__>	the first question I asked my sister was "what was wrong with his windows?"
<theunixfreak>	reisio: ok, i will try to get the link...
<theunixfreak>	MrElendig: :D
<reisio>	kinda like how the person who graduated last in medical school is called doctor :D
<dixie__>	I mean, seriouly?  you're gonna knock on the door?  wtf?
<reisio>	best to just ignore it, and then trip him whilst he's walking near the volcano
*	dixie__ hioghfives ohcanada 
<reisio>	portable volcanoes ftw
<dixie__>	reisio: they have those now.
<reisio>	I can almost afford one
<reisio>	saving my bottle caps
<dixie__>	there are better options these days.  at 1/2 the price.
<treaki>	reisio, do you know about that possiblity??
<dixie__>	and then there's the classic embossing gun and oven bag solution, which costs $50 and works better.
<dixie__>	but that's neither here nor there.
<reisio>	hrmmm, anyone know some decent win32+unix encryption packages, like truecrypt but more maintained and slightly less awful?
<ocZio>	Hi, is it possible to generate a fake key and provide that for the client to use when conneting with ssh ? I have a server that I want to give a key for a client to connect with (ideally provide the key from command line rather than id_pub)
<reisio>	treaki: about what?
<dixie__>	reisio: those don't exist.
<MrElendig>	tar + gpg
*	Guest2 is now known as gattuso
<treaki>	to change the block size of the msdos disk lable
<reisio>	dixie__: well I didn't think so :p
<reisio>	I'm leaning towards encfs
<MrElendig>	treaki: block size is up to your hardware
<reisio>	which has its problems, but not truecrypt's
<reisio>	exactly
<MrElendig>	treaki: it knows better than you
<treaki>	yes i know, but after what i heared there is a logical block size of the msdos disk lable (mbr) that can be set to use big hdds with mbrs...
<dixie__>	at a certain point you kinda just need to draw a line in the sand and say that your level of security meets the needs of your application.
<theunixfreak>	reisio: Okay buddy. I don't have a link. I used the r8192ee driver till kernel 3.18 i think, when it was merged to rtlwifi
<treaki>	or is the mbr block sized fixed to 512 bytes??
<theunixfreak>	reisio: the debian website still says the driver to use is r8192ee
<theunixfreak>	reisio: i will try that, i hope it is less buggy
<reisio>	theunixfreak: g'luck
<dixie__>	reisio: could always invest in an atheros card.
<gaaara>	re hello
<reisio>	could always invest in butterflies
<reisio>	or just by that big hard copy of the internet's porn
<gaaara>	with freshplayerplugin it works just not compatible with drm
<reisio>	gaaara: us the config option then
<reisio>	use*
<reisio>	gaaara: what site is this?
<gaaara>	illico.tv
<dixie__>	anyone wanna buy some tulips?
<treaki>	reisio, MrElendig, however it is possible or not to change block size of msdos disklable (mbr) it is no working with gpt over here, so thanks a lot for your help and have a nice day everyone

<agliodbs>	I'm just now looking at a system where %utilization for the main array is reported at 60% to 100%, but cpu stats are reporting IOWait at < 1%.  Given how %util is calculated, I'm unclear on how it can be high if IOWait is near-zero.  Ideas?
<maarhart>	ok Cirrus_Minor what should I do?
<GNU\colossus>	utilization != saturation
<GNU\colossus>	utilization is just "non-idle time"

<felipe>	But it is ony copying the file1 to the new file
<Cirrus_Minor>	lol thats not a script
<felipe>	What Am I doing wrong ?
<saymoo>	maarhart, take the device that is the right one (on the left, check sizes) with the lsblk command then do blkid /dev/sdx<num>   <- x is de device letter  <num> is de partition number..
<GNU\colossus>	felipe, nothing. are file2 and file3 empty, perchance?
<Psi-Jack>	Cirrus_Minor: So, you're literally typing that arrow, every time? :p
<Cirrus_Minor>	Psi-Jack ➤   no its a weechat suffix

<GNU\colossus>	felipe, ah, then that won't work. your player will recognize the first file's container, and think that's it.
<GNU\colossus>	it depends on the container format what your options to concat the files are
<Cirrus_Minor>	maarhart ➤    ill try make it quick as i seem to be annoying folk  look at my fstab i posted, edit your fstab using your drives uuid, give user perimissions to the /mnt/mountpoint folder  and read what options u need in fstab for the suspend/hibernate
<Psi-Jack>	AND he uses shtspk on top of it. :/
<Cirrus_Minor>	s/folk/person
<maarhart>	saymoo: /dev/sdc1: UUID="64eea22b-ed3f-4d55-aa48-75546c85d057" TYPE="ext4" PARTUUID="2fd01007-1734-4c14-a521-7ec4285f3f90"
<saymoo>	maarhart, perfect, then use the information you posted with Cirrus_Minor his version
*	DolpheenDream is now known as DolphinDream
<saymoo>	whoopsie, net split
<maarhart>	saymoo: sorry, use it with what?
<Psi-Jack>	saymoo: Didn't see it. Very nice not to see joins/parts. :)
<felipe>	GNU\colossus:  mp4 files
<ohcanada>	felipe: you might be able to use avidemux to join the videos. but cat is definitely no use, as GNU\colossus mentioned
<saymoo>	maarhart, didn't Cirrus_Minor provided your with his fstab listing?
*	humerusj is now known as 21WABYV3D
*	DolphinDream is now known as 5EXAA5LQR
*	jgeboski- is now known as jgeboski
<felipe>	ohcanada:  Okay, thanks I'll try this program.
<maarhart>	yes, but what am I supposed to do with that fstab?
<maarhart>	I don't know what to substitute there
<saymoo>	maarhart, compare it with your version.. then adjust it with the uuid information you have of your device
<Cirrus_Minor>	maarhart ➤    read the archwiki fstab entry, it tells you all you need to know
<Cirrus_Minor>	whether using arch or not
<maarhart>	so I use UUID, not PARTUUID right?
<saymoo>	indeed the archwiki has very detailed info (as always)
<Cirrus_Minor>	like the pastebin i posted UUID=
<saymoo>	indeed UUID not PARTUUID
<saymoo>	(afaik)
<Cirrus_Minor>	back up current fstab makin mistake here will render your box unbootable
<Psi-Jack>	Mmmm, PARTUUID can be good too, if you're using GPT partitions anyway.
<maarhart>	saymoo: okay, I put in /etc/fstab UUID=64eea22b-ed3f-4d55-aa48-75546c85d057 /mnt/sdb1 auto nosuid,nodev,nofail,x-gvfs-show 0 0
<maarhart>	hopefully I am doing the right thing. now what? save, suspend and see what happens?
<Cirrus_Minor>	you gonna have to read wht options you need for hibernate/suspend
<Cirrus_Minor>	coz idk
<maarhart>	from this arch wiki you mean?
<Cirrus_Minor>	prolly be in there
<Psi-Jack>	Idiots Dunno Know?
<}>	Psi-Jack, ?
<Psi-Jack>	Cables of Zen?
<Cirrus_Minor>	google 'fstab hibernate suspend'
<Cirrus_Minor>	see what transpires
<}>	Psi-Jack, are you having a stroke
<}>	I will call an ambulance
<Psi-Jack>	}: Just trying to translate Cirrus_Minor  into proper English. :)
<}>	ow
<Cirrus_Minor>	Psi-Jack ➤    im scottish so dont bother
<DLange>	call the hearse!
<Psi-Jack>	I'm Scottish too. :)
<Cirrus_Minor>	we haz our own brand ;)
<saymoo>	maarhart, i also would advise you to use ext4 instead of auto
<Cirrus_Minor>	yay
*	} imagines Psi-Jack in a kilt
<saymoo>	since it's an ext4 part
<Psi-Jack>	}: I have one, actually.

<Psi-Jack>	I have one of those too, and know how to play. :)
*	} imagines Psi-Jack playing a bagpipe while wearing a kilt in his server room

<Psi-Jack>	I have done that! :)
*	Cirrus_Minor imagines Psi-Jack  tossing teh caber

<maarhart>	ok so far: UUID=64eea22b-ed3f-4d55-aa48-75546c85d057 /mnt/sdb1 ext3 nosuid,nodev,nofail,x-gvfs-show 0 0
<Psi-Jack>	Heh. I don't, however, toss the caber.
<saymoo>	ext4?
<saymoo>	err
<saymoo>	ext3? why ext3?
<Cirrus_Minor>	the part where options,nosuid,nodev,nofail etc may need somin to define hibernate/suspend idk
<saymoo>	your line you gave with the uuid, minutes earlier stated ext4
<Cirrus_Minor>	im guessing Psi-Jack  you are an aberdonian or from embra ?
<Psi-Jack>	Sadomastocistic Ordinary Intentional Newts?
<}>	Psi-Jack, is this you http://i.imgur.com/u6ixmVZ.png
<LinuxManDan>	Is there a way to fond out where software was installed to?
<maarhart>	oops, sorry saymoo, ext4

<GNU\colossus>	dpkg -L packagename
<LinuxManDan>	Thank you.
<LinuxManDan>	Will try dpkg
<ohcanada>	rpm -ql packagename
<maarhart>	okay, my issue might be like this: https://ask.fedoraproject.org/en/question/7676/usb-devsdb-renamed-devsdc-after-suspend/
<LinuxManDan>	dpkg worked.  Thank you.
*	Sarge123^off is now known as Sarge123
<Cirrus_Minor>	i told ya in fstab use uuid  not /dev/sd* sd* can and will change
<maarhart>	Cirrus_Minor: that is what I did, UUID=64eea22b-ed3f-4d55-aa48-75546c85d057 /mnt/sdb1 ext4 nosuid,nodev,nofail,x-gvfs-show 0 0
<saymoo>	maarhart, perhaps you should use the user as option too..
<maarhart>	so I guess I just try and suspend.
<maarhart>	saymoo: example?
<Cirrus_Minor>	,foof,user,fi
<saymoo>	UUID=64eea22b-ed3f-4d55-aa48-75546c85d057 /mnt/sdb1 ext4 user,nosuid,nodev,nofail,x-gvfs-show 0 0
<maarhart>	saymoo: literally user or should my username be there?
<Cirrus_Minor>	no
<saymoo>	user
<saymoo>	not your username
<maarhart>	ok. I will suspend then

<mentoc>	I need to make a program that can detect mouse movements from a usb wireless mouse. Is there a way to do this by reading from a device in /dev buried somewhere? I'm really new to this
<saymoo>	mentoc, why you need to do that?
<mentoc>	saymoo: It's a poor man's alarm system
<Cirrus_Minor>	this is nice https://davedavenport.github.io/rofi/
<mentoc>	saymoo: the wireless mouse is set atop a piece of paper. When the paper is moved, the mouse detects that
<saymoo>	i see
<mentoc>	saymoo: currently, I open a window and detect movement within the window, but the cursor could easily stray off outside the window
<maarhart>	saymoo: Cirrus_Minor: I think that you guys solved my issue.
<maarhart>	and someone else as well
<saymoo>	maarhart, so it works?
<mentoc>	saymoo: So I think if I could detect the mouse movement before it propagates, that would be exactly what I need.
<Cirrus_Minor>	good stuff maarhart
<maarhart>	well, I don't see the cd anymore, now it looks like a disk but it seems to take a while to load
<maarhart>	I rebooted again and will check again
<maarhart>	again and again
<ohcanada>	mentoc: cat /dev/input/mice, and move the mouse
<mentoc>	ohcanada: Oh wow. That worked. I wonder if it will work with my usb wireless mouse though
<mentoc>	ohcanada: now, how about this: reading from the mouse but stopping it from propagating
<maarhart>	nope, it does not work. be right back
<ohcanada>	mentoc: not easy to grab the mouse without writing an X prog
<maarhart>	nope, not working
<maarhart>	I still see the CD
<mentoc>	ohcanada: Want to see how I've been grabbing it so far?
<maarhart>	actually two cd's. One is called WD smartware, the other one 319 GB volume
<maarhart>	319 GB volume is the one I would normally use
<Cirrus_Minor>	maarhart ➤    i think in tour fstab options,foo,fi  needs something to define hibernate/suspend  look into that
<ohcanada>	mentoc: sure
<maarhart>	Cirrus_Minor: I tried googling
<Cirrus_Minor>	ok
<mentoc>	ohcanada: https://github.com/iteratedlateralus/tripwire/blob/master/xev.c
<Cirrus_Minor>	maarhart ➤    even tho the filemanager shows the device as a cd, you can still do what you need to do ?
<maarhart>	Cirrus_Minor: no
<Cirrus_Minor>	maarhart ➤    what cant you do ?
<maarhart>	I click on the cd and I cannot see the contents... I get this rolling thingy
<maarhart>	ls shows it is empty
<maarhart>	I basically cannot see its content
<Remram>	I just did `chattr +C disk.vdi` but `lsattr disk.vdi` doesn't show the C
<Cirrus_Minor>	maarhart ➤    check you have pm-utils pkg
<Remram>	why? How do I fix it?
<maarhart>	pm-utils: command not found
<maarhart>	pm-utils is already the newest version
<maarhart>	which: no pm-utils in (/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin)
<Taoki>	Hello. Does anyone know if openSUSE has any program in its repositories that can properly show panoramic (360*) images and videos? As in allow mouse-looking through them, like the new Youtube 360* feature. Gwenview doesn't seem to have this for pictures, nor does VLC let me playback 360* videos accordingly.
<Cirrus_Minor>	maarhart ➤    the kernel parameter resume=swap_partition has to be used.
<Remram>	maarhart: there is no executable pm-utils
<Cirrus_Minor>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate
<reisio>	Taoki: panini?
<Taoki>	My distro doesn't seem to have it. Might look for it separately in that case
<reisio>	Taoki: there's probably an rpm somewheres
<maarhart>	Cirrus_Minor: UUID=64eea22b-ed3f-4d55-aa48-75546c85d057 /mnt/sdb1 ext4 resume=swap_partition,user,nosuid,nodev,nofail,x-gvfs-show 0 0
<maarhart>	like that?
<ohcanada>	mentoc: you have a pesky roommate who uses your shit and you want to confront them with irrefutable evidence of their malfeasance?
<Cirrus_Minor>	no maarhart  kernel parameters dont go there
<mentoc>	ohcanada: Something like that. Maybe I have an underwear burglar
<Cirrus_Minor>	maarhart ➤    https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_parameters
<}>	ohcanada, malfeasance, still watching that documentary eh? :)
<ohcanada>	mentoc: sound activated is an option. or motion detect from cam
<mentoc>	ohcanada: that would be cool too
<mentoc>	ohcanada: I have an arduino that can detect audio levels
<maarhart>	Cirrus_Minor: so I try cat /proc/cmdline ?
<Cirrus_Minor>	no maarhart  read the link i posted
<ohcanada>	mentoc: http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome
<Cirrus_Minor>	you edit your bootloaders config
<Cirrus_Minor>	be it grub,syslinux,lilo etc
<maarhart>	grub2
<mentoc>	ohcanada: lol that's badass
<mentoc>	ohcanada: you're pretty cool for a canadian :P
<maarhart>	but cat /proc/cmdline would tell me if that parameter is used in my boot or not
<maarhart>	and it is not: BOOT_IMAGE=/boot/vmlinuz-3.19.0-16-generic.efi.signed root=UUID=0790d803-c48a-402c-9bef-b8ab85f62159 ro quiet quiet splash vt.handoff=7

<Cirrus_Minor>	ok maarhart  edit it to suit, you should be golden
<ayecee>	_somebody_ here takes a thesaurus with him to the bathroom
<Hanumaan>	how to truncate maillog automatically?
<Cirrus_Minor>	Hanumaan ➤    ?  cronjob ?
<maarhart>	Cirrus_Minor: so I edit that, and not the grub cfg?
<Cirrus_Minor>	edit what maarhart  ?
<Hanumaan>	Cirrus_Minor, actually I wanted to know how to trucate manually first and then I could do with cronjob? my question .. was not correct ..
<maarhart>	nothing. I edit grub.cfg
<Cirrus_Minor>	yes maarhart #
<maarhart>	Cirrus_Minor: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash resume=swap_partition"
<maarhart>	like that, right?
<Cirrus_Minor>	maarhart ➤    after the uuid
<maarhart>	and then grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg or grub-update ?

<maarhart>	Cirrus_Minor: do you mean this in grub: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="resume=swap_partition quiet splash"

<maarhart>	okay
<maarhart>	sorry :)
<Psi-Jack>	hehe
<maarhart>	so basically, my external hard drive looks like a CD
<maarhart>	it has a cd icon
<maarhart>	if I wake up from suspend
<ayecee>	how does it look from something that's not a gui?
<maarhart>	ayecee: what do you mean?
<ayecee>	maarhart: are you able to interact with it as a hard drive from the command line?
<maarhart>	If I try to access its contents, it just loads forever, I don't get to see them.
<ayecee>	maarhart: is that from the gui, or from the command line?
<maarhart>	If I unplug it and plug it again, then I still see it as a CD but I can write and read from it

<Cirrus_Minor>	slash dot
<poio>	nobody at the xbian channel :(
<Cirrus_Minor>	yes maarhart , worth a try
<Psi-Jack>	maarhart: *sigh* Enter is not punctuation. You should learn to be more specific, detailed, and think more while typing, instead of thinking a partial thought, hitting enter, thinking another partial thought, hitting enter, etc.. It's not a race.
<poio>	anyone wants to help?
<ayecee>	poio: no one can help if you don't describe the problem.
<Cirrus_Minor>	^^
<maarhart>	http://paste.debian.net/172179
<poio>	i described it before but no one answered
<poio>	well, here I go again
<ayecee>	poio: then no one can help
<maarhart>	so now this is after it woke up from suspend, was unplugged and plugged again
<poio>	tried several versions of XBIAN on my B+, none of them seems to show anything on screen

<ayecee>	poio: ah, this is a raspberry pi question. definitely not the right channel.
<Psi-Jack>	poio: Same thing I just told maarhart, you're doing. Hitting enter like it's candy.
<poio>	and the hardware is not the problem since OpeELEC and OSMC run smoothly
<}>	Psi-Jack, why would you hit candy
<Cirrus_Minor>	poio ➤    use archlinux-arm :)  i run it as server on 1st gen rpi, its solid
<Psi-Jack>	Cirrus_Minor: Get into a box.
<Cirrus_Minor>	which one Psi-Jack ?
<toothe>	i noticed that when I logged in via key-based auth, I was told "You have X items to be patched", but now when I login via key-based I don't get those messages....what gives?
<Psi-Jack>	Telling people what to use without consideration of anything, is rude. :p
<Cirrus_Minor>	im rude, i guess. it was merely a suggestion
<poio>	Cirrus_Minor: Thanks I will check it out
<Cirrus_Minor>	yw poio , what do you want to use the pi for ?
<poio>	ayecee: Well, actually I'm asking about XBian, which is a Linux based distribution
<Psi-Jack>	Cirrus_Minor: Just like I "suggested" for you to get into a box? ;)
<Cirrus_Minor>	ok i never heard of it :/
<ayecee>	poio: no amount of lawyering will help you here.
<Cirrus_Minor>	 /nick jack
<}>	Cirrus_Minor, nice try
<poio>	Cirrus_Minor: I just want to use it as media center: just play my media from a NFS share on another pi and PVR client
<ayecee>	poio: you're not even at the point where linux is running.
<poio>	ayecee: that's a good point
<Cirrus_Minor>	well poio  openelec would be my suggestion

<ayecee>	Cirrus_Minor is full of mere suggestions
<Cirrus_Minor>	lol
*	Cirrus_Minor is full of something
<poio>	Cirrus_Minor, yes... I've been using it for a while, but I want to try another distribution because of my PVR Client
<ayecee>	"my car isn't working, how do i fix it?" "you should try a new car, i like my new car"
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<Psi-Jack>	ayecee: Precisely!
<poio>	It just halts after a while, with an OMTX error telling me there is not enough resources
<Cirrus_Minor>	poio ➤    i use a few cli apps for media consumption, livestreamer is superb will work on any os

<Cirrus_Minor>	http://cirrus.minor.info
<Cirrus_Minor>	http://cirrusminor.info
<Cirrus_Minor>	sorry
<poio>	Psi-Jack: yes, but the problem appeared from Openelec 5.0.5
<poio>	Psi-Jack: before that version I had it running and playing live TV for weeks without problem

<Elec_A>	Hello, I have ubuntu 12.04 installed . I had GCC and G++ version 4.6.3 installed, I followed http://askubuntu.com/questions/271388/how-to-install-gcc-4-8 , but only gcc version changed to 4.8.1 and g++ version is 4.6.3 how can i update g++ ?
<Psi-Jack>	Lets not start talking about illegal services. :p
<pid1>	Cirrus_Minor, No need for that, but thanks. Everything I watch is YouTube or Jupiter Broadcasting, really.
<pid1>	Netflix with the missus occasionally.
<Cirrus_Minor>	safe
<maarhart>	Cirrus_Minor: gave up right?
<SporkWitch>	netflix needs to get their crap in order and work on firefox; it supports everything it needs now
<Cirrus_Minor>	 im afraid so maarhart  im out of mere suggestions, did you try adding rw to fstab options ?
<ayecee>	Elec_A: apt-get install g++-4.8, i imagine
<pid1>	SporkWitch, Widevine is not available for Firefox yet.
<}>	pid1, what's that?
<Elec_A>	ayecee: I executed that , but still 4.6.3
<SporkWitch>	pid1: not familiar with it; so far as i understand the last barrier was HTML5 DRM, which firefox now supports
<ayecee>	Elec_A: what happened when you executed that?
<pid1>	} the content decryption module that Netflix uses.
<MrElendig>	Elec_A: use the full path to the 4.8 g++
<pid1>	SporkWitch, You need both HTML5's DRM decryption and the Widevine module.
<Elec_A>	MrElendig: may i ask you to explain how ?
<SporkWitch>	pid1: interesting...
<pid1>	That's why Chromium still needs the Widevine module from the AUR.
<maarhart>	Cirrus_Minor: I did. you can read and write but still a CD
<pid1>	Even though that's supported DRMed HTML5 for a while.
<SporkWitch>	not that much of a pain to just boot chrome for netflix, i just don't like having to have a separate browser
<Elec_A>	ayecee: just a successfull package installation message
<pid1>	Firefox did add EME support recently, but that's different.
<MrElendig>	/path/to/the/4.8binary
<poio>	finally managed to boot XBian, just used an older build. I can't believe no one reported this, there's a lot of people with the same hardware...
<SporkWitch>	(wouldn't bother me as much if chrome's plugin ecosystem weren't crap, and its memory management so horrifically bad)
<MrElendig>	set CXX to it
<ayecee>	Elec_A: what happens if you run g++-4.8 now?
<Elec_A>	i want to have -std=c11, but i get an error.
<Elec_A>	-std=c++11
<ayecee>	Elec_A: what happens if you run g++-4.8 now?
<}>	I know what <(cmd) does and what < file does, but what does $(< file) do?
<pid1>	SporkWitch, It really is gross. I have a Chromecast and a Chromebook for the gross stuff I don't want touching my production/work laptop.
<Demetria>	Hi there i have been having problems adding Canon Image Runner 1025 N printer, someone that already did it?
<thevishy>	is that possible to make ur desktop envrionment work in insert / command mode
<Elec_A>	ayecee: I cannot use -std=c++11 , because of old version
<ayecee>	Demetria: no, it doesn't look like it.
<Psi-Jack>	thevishy: I don't think "ur" is here to respond to your demands.
<Demetria>	D:
<MrElendig>	Demetria: canons are mostly paperweights
<SporkWitch>	pid1: eh, i don't see a good reason to have to isolate it like that, it's just annoying having to have a second browser JUST for netflix
<MrElendig>	Demetria: see the openprinting db
<ayecee>	Elec_A: what happens if you run g++-4.8 --version ?
<SporkWitch>	pid1: but it does behave better than the netflix desktop package someone made (firefox + mono in WINE)
<thevishy>	your*
<Demetria>	MrElendig: tks will take a look
*	gms is now known as Guest96577
<pid1>	SporkWitch, It isn't just for that, but I see your point. I need it for a few Flash-enabled websites, and as a spare dumb SSH terminal when I'm at the office.
<}>	thevishy, what do you mean with insert/command mode?
<pid1>	It has great battery life, so I just SSH into my work desktop from that while I'm in a meeting.
<Elec_A>	ayecee: I get 4.8.1
<SporkWitch>	pid1: makes sense
<thevishy>	wonder if there are desktop environments that have insert / command mode paradigm ... } - so that you dont use modifier keys
<}>	thevishy, I see no reason why you cant do that in any scriptable DE/window manager
<ayecee>	Elec_A: okay, so what was the command with -std that gave you the error?
<thevishy>	right } I would check up yes it should be possible
<SporkWitch>	thevishy: zsh has a vi mode
<thevishy>	but SporkWitch that is not a window manager
<linuxthefish>	how do i grep for "-darl"?
<SporkWitch>	thevishy: then ratpoison
<linuxthefish>	"grep: invalid argument ‘arl’ for ‘--directories’"
<MrElendig>	linuxthefish: --
<thevishy>	alright, i have heard of ratpoison, will look up
<ayecee>	linuxthefish: grep -- "-darl" filename
<linuxthefish>	thanks!
<thevishy>	thanks for the suggestion
<guipy>	dear fellows, anyone here ever used vmalloc? how can i use it ? which header i must include?
<Elec_A>	ayecee: I am compiling a demo code , and after executing make, i get "cc1plus: error: unrecognized command line option ‘-std=c++11’ "
<sheap>	how do I include an ethernet card driver into the preseed? Intel just gives the source code
<SporkWitch>	thevishy: i doubt you're going to find exactly what you're talking about, though.  conventions like alt-tab and the like are more efficient than separate modes, because the workflow in a graphical environment is different than a text-only one
<ayecee>	guipy: you'd only use it within kernel code.
<ayecee>	Elec_A: what is the g++ commandline that gave you the error?
<guipy>	hmmm...thanks ayecee, it's bad in fact...i need a big chunk inside my program
<ayecee>	Elec_A: could it be calling g++ instead of g++-4.8 ?
<guipy>	but malloc cn't find contiguous space
<thevishy>	SporkWitch: Alright, I was just curious :)
<ayecee>	guipy: why do you need contiguous space?
<Elec_A>	ayecee: yes , i think so. i have to browse cmake files to find that
<guipy>	i don't need..it's only malloc failing
<Elec_A>	ayecee: is it possible to change g++ to g++-4.8
<ayecee>	Elec_A: at this point, gcc points to gcc-4.8, but g++ points to g++-4.6, is that correct?
<Elec_A>	ayecee: yes exactly
<guipy>	after 2GB it gets segfault for no reason
<ayecee>	Elec_A: if so, i think you'd need to run update-alternatives g++, but i'm not 100% sure on that.
<ayecee>	guipy: what leads you to believe that vmalloc will work differently?
<hassoon>	nabs
<guipy>	ayecee, i read (might be wrong) that if malloc can't find contiguous space, it can return non-null pointer and after that, once you toch the data, crash
<ayecee>	Elec_A: i've never used update-alternatives by hand, so i don't know the command line options very well.
<ayecee>	guipy: where did you read that?
<Elec_A>	ayecee: then what do you do ?
<guipy>	stackoverflow
<guipy>	i might have been understood wrong
<guipy>	is it false
<ayecee>	Elec_A: i was hoping it'd bring up a menu asking you which option you wanted to use?
<guipy>	?
<ayecee>	guipy: i have no idea without looking at it.
<ayecee>	Elec_A: maybe update-alternatives --list g++ will show you some options.
<ayecee>	guipy: that doesn't sound like malloc behavior that i'm aware of, though.
<MrElendig>	just set CXX as you need
<Elec_A>	ayecee: I get an error saying no alternative for g++
<MrElendig>	CXX=gcc-4.8 make whatever
<ayecee>	bummer. yeah, i guess set CXX variable for now when calling make
<ayecee>	err, CXX=g++-4.8
<Elec_A>	MrElendig: should i export CXX=gcc-4.8 ?
<MrElendig>	no
<Elec_A>	just execute "CXX=gcc-4.8" ?
<Elec_A>	just execute "CXX=g++-4.8" ?
<ayecee>	CXX=g++-4.8 make
<guipy>	ayecee: i need to go in bakery right now or it'll close...before, take a look at the code if you want.
<guipy>	http://pastebin.com/sGBrxV40
<guipy>	it breaks on initArray, after 2GB
<guipy>	i'm here in next hour...
*	fxmulder_ is now known as fxmulder
<Elec_A>	MrElendig , ayecee , i still get <cc1plus: error: unrecognized command line option ‘-std=c++11’ > error
<ayecee>	guipy: you're using a 32-bit system, i guess?
<MrElendig>	post the exact command you used
<ayecee>	Elec_A: it may be the makefile doesn't honor the CXX variable. gonna have to find a way to get it to show you what the commands are that it's running.
<ayecee>	Elec_A: you might check if g++ is a symlink, with "ls -l `which g++`". if it is, you can replace the symlink with one that points to the right one.
<Elec_A>	ayecee: sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.8 50 , did the jib !
<Elec_A>	job !
<ayecee>	\o/
<Elec_A>	no more -std=C++11,
<Elec_A>	no more -std=C++11 error anymore :D,
<Elec_A>	thank you
<ayecee>	:)
<MrElendig>	that is a workaround though not a real fix
<MrElendig>	it should repect CXX and CC
<ayecee>	that's the real fix. CXX was a workaround that didn't work.
<ayecee>	because not all makefiles honor it.
<MrElendig>	those makefiles should be fixed
<ayecee>	yes
<MrElendig>	setting CXX is not a workaround
<MrElendig>	it is how it should work
<ayecee>	setting CXX is how you'd use a compiler that isn't your regular compiler
<Cthulchu>	Hi, guys :) I have another question on amazon linux... I have a semiroot user, which can use ssh. The authentication method is an openssh key. When I try connecting with a different user, it doesn't allow me. As I understand, I should edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config adding AllowUsers s_user39
<ayecee>	what's the question?
<Cthulchu>	is that right? :)
<ayecee>	sounds like it would work
<edoardo>	Hi!
<Cthulchu>	How would you grant a user root privileges? I used sudo visudo
<Cthulchu>	Can I do the same with nano or mcedit? I'm not a big lover of vi
<edoardo>	I'm part of the www-data group, and still i can't access this directory:
<edoardo>	drw-rw---- 2 edoardo www-data 4096 May  6 16:46 test2
<edoardo>	what did i do wrong?
<ayecee>	edoardo: no +x on the dir
<edoardo>	ayecee: so 770?
<edoardo>	hey it works
<edoardo>	thanks
<MrElendig>	Cthulchu: EDITOR=whatever sudo visudo
<MrElendig>	or explicitly pass it in, depending on your sudo config

<oiu>	I've been messing around with Linux for a little while now on the desktop (specifically, Xubuntu). I'm a complete beginner, and was wondering if you guys could recommend some books for me to use to supplement my learning? Paperback, PDFs, it doesn't matter.
<oiu>	I'm enjoying myself so far and want to take this seriously.
<SporkWitch>	oiu: http://www.tldp.org/LDP/sag/sag.pdf
<oiu>	Also, anything else you'd recommend is great... So far I've just messed about with it on the desktop and experimented with Bash, but that's it. I really am new.
<oiu>	SporkWitch: Thanks!
<EriC^^>	that is a good guide oiu, there's also the gnu-commands guide http://www.tldp.org/LDP/GNU-Linux-Tools-Summary/GNU-Linux-Tools-Summary.pdf
<nafg>	Hi can two Linux installations share a /boot partition?
<MrElendig>	yes
<MrElendig>	make sure there are no file conflicts or use subdirs
<nafg>	Because i somehow just messed things up by doing that
<nafg>	@mrelendig all menu entries go to the same Linux now
<MrElendig>	would be easier if distroes stopped being stupid and started implementing http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/BootLoaderSpec/
<Cthulchu>	Could you please help? how do we reboot ssh on Amazon linux? http://i.imgur.com/e80CO52.png
<MrElendig>	just fix your bootloader config then
<SporkWitch>	Cthulchu: you mean restart the ssh server (sshd)?
<Cthulchu>	oh, yes :)
<SporkWitch>	Cthulchu: try service sshd restart
<Cthulchu>	sure
<Cthulchu>	it works. Thanks!
<SporkWitch>	yup
<oiu>	EriC^^: Thank you!
<EriC^^>	oiu: no problem!
<Cthulchu>	interesting... I rebooted ssh via ssh and my session didn't break.
<SporkWitch>	sounds like it didn't work, then
<SporkWitch>	it should've dropped the connection and you'd have had to reconnect
<Cthulchu>	It didn't, but it showed me green OK, indicating that it rebooted.
*	stryyker2 is now known as Stryyker
<Cthulchu>	maybe it's some kind of a fancy sshd :)
<HiDeHo>	Hi all i am wanting to know what you recomend as being the best os for arm devices there are many i have seen out there. I have found that Arm tends to lack many apps that x86 os have.
<Psi-Jack>	HiDeHo: Only YOU can answer such questions for YOU.
<ayecee>	HiDeHo: one usually doesn't get a lot of choices for an arm device.
<MrElendig>	there are very few programs that you can't build for arm
*	gattuso is now known as Guest1
*	Guest1 is now known as gattuso
<HiDeHo>	Mri have been using a ubuntu 14.40 resoin of arm atm and it seems to lack many apps that come with traditional x86 os
<Cthulchu>	hell. I locked the system. Now I can't authenticate with the key AND I can't authenticate with a pwd. I had to set an authentication method.
<HiDeHo>	yyues i understand
<Cthulchu>	Well... I guess I spoiled the server
<HiDeHo>	Cthulchu, thre are usually backdoor solutions or a reinstall if all else fails.
<Cthulchu>	yup
<Cthulchu>	but I don't have access to the server admin panel :)
<HiDeHo>	from my experience anyway
<Cthulchu>	I shouldn't have played with it
<HiDeHo>	Cthulchu, reinstall the os is easy enough to do. unless its not your computer
<PeterFA>	I just got an idea: an SQL FS. It's not an FS that supports an SQL DBMS but it's actually a translation layer between an SQL DBMS that presents records like files, and is mountable like a normal FS.
<PeterFA>	This way, your web application can store files in the SQL tables and provide links to them.
<ayecee>	PeterFA: i wonder if someone has done that yet
<PeterFA>	This would be used for CDNs and and CMS.
<PeterFA>	ayecee, a good question.

<kba>	how could I fix this? Linking jifc into some bin folder wouldn't work too well

<xeon-enouf>	EriC^^: re: cp, and copying dir/ structure only; perhaps you're thinking of the tree utility  #if you haven't found that already
<EriC^^>	xeon-enouf: nah i found the link it said to use cp -Rs /source /dest
<EriC^^>	but that creates the dir structure plus symbolic links for files
<EriC^^>	xeon-enouf: thanks for the feedback though
<EriC^^>	xeon-enouf: i think the author meant for it to be used on ntfs and such
<EriC^^>	just tried it on ntfs it works cause it can't create the symlinks
<EriC^^>	xeon-enouf: oh, it actually works on ext, but you have to use relative paths
<EriC^^>	so it fails on the symlinks with can make relative symbolic links only in current directory
<EriC^^>	like cp -Rs dirtocopy anotherdir

<SpiceMan>	no
<kurahaupo>	codebam: it depends... if you can connect a debugger to the process then you can open a new tty. There are some programs that can automate some of this for you
<johnkeates>	or you could use screen
<johnkeates>	of you don't want to use screen or tmux, or if you simply forgot to use it, debuggers might be your only option
<kurahaupo>	johnkeates: see OP

<toothe>	is there a command to flush your DNS cache?
<codebam>	annihilannic: forget it... I'll just leave X running. I don't want to end up killing the process by accident

<stanford_drone>	Our startup got funded! We're going to Shenzhen, China to build a personal gaming drone. This is a flying robot that you can play with. It mostly uses computer vision and Artificial Intelligence. We're looking to hire one or two more linux C++ programmers to join us during the summer. If you know any good programmer available from July to October (inclusive, preferably), please let me know! Send a resume at roitman@cs.stanford.edu or message me.
<thejourney>	which can't really have changed anything
<ayecee>	thejourney: what did you uninstall?
<thejourney>	ayecee, nothing
<thejourney>	I don't think
<thejourney>	hmmm
<thejourney>	laugh at me :-p
<thejourney>	I got rid of some stuff in a directory I created in nginx for purpose
<thejourney>	when i say that - within var/www/html
<calamari>	I set up sshfs to share minecraft saves across the various computers in the house, but it seems to either be too slow or it's caching, because blocks I break sometimes come back. I tried turning of all the caching options I could. Is sshfs just not a good solution for this?
<reisio>	calamari: come back when?
<calamari>	reisio: after about 2 seconds?
<thejourney>	ayecee, http://snag.gy/w5Myk.jpg
<toothe>	how do I clear my dns cache?
<thejourney>	does the padlock mean anything
<SpiceMan>	calamari: it isn't.
<reisio>	you're trying to use saved data simultaneously?
<calamari>	reisio: no
<calamari>	reisio: it's just one at a time.. I never even got the 2nd computer set up
<ayecee>	thejourney: probably yes. rightclick on it and check the properties.
<reisio>	should work fine
<reisio>	unless minecraft is poop
<reisio>	which it is
<calamari>	reisio: so I guess to simplify it, I tried putting my saves on a different computer and sshfs to them
<calamari>	I wanted to use nfs, but the kernel isn't built for it
<thejourney>	ayecee, http://snag.gy/Gi2Vw.jpg
<dimitry7>	Hi guys, how can I parse an array to a function in bash?
<dimitry7>	version 4.1.5
<ayecee>	thejourney: i don't know what these titles mean. could you open a commandline and get them from ls -l?
<SpiceMan>	parse an array?
<reisio>	#bash
<dimitry7>	SpiceMan, yup
<dimitry7>	SpiceMan, rotation ${#DATES_SNAPS[@]} ${#SNAPS_IDS[@]}
<dimitry7>	that didn't work :S
<SpiceMan>	that doesn't make sense.
<SpiceMan>	(parsing an array, that is)
<thejourney>	ayecee, what do you want from command line?
<dimitry7>	SpiceMan, ok, im glad so I know why it does not work
<thejourney>	permissions for which dir
<dimitry7>	but how can I do it? i need to parse two arrays
<ayecee>	thejourney: ls -ld /var/www/html/GGtestzone
<dimitry7>	to the same function
<annihilannic>	do you nean "pass" an array?
<annihilannic>	and by nean I mean mean
<dimitry7>	annihilannic, haha ok
<dimitry7>	pass an array, actually two arrays
<calamari>	I'm assuming sshfs is fairly slow.. is there a faster option (besides nfs)?
<ayecee>	calamari: speed is probably not the problem there.
<ayecee>	calamari: you're not transferring large amounts of data.
<TinFox>	oh sourceforge, I'm just disappointed.
<thejourney>	ayecee, http://snag.gy/iXONd.jpg
<thejourney>	thanks :-)
<annihilannic>	dimitry7: perhaps put a separator between them so you can identify where one ends and the other starts
<ayecee>	hmm. what does the . mean at the end of ls -l permissions? selinux, or acl?
<FreezingCold>	I used wget to download a website, but it's missing MathMenu.js and MathZoom.js, any ideas on how to fix those?
<dimitry7>	annihilannic, the strings are separated
<dimitry7>	rotation ${#DATES_SNAPS[@]} ${#SNAPS_IDS[@]}
<dimitry7>	one for dates and one for snaps
<annihilannic>	ayecee: selinux
<thejourney>	ayecee, selinux is set to permissive mode
<dimitry7>	annihilannic, I need to parse them as function arguments
<ayecee>	thejourney: eh, it's probably not a permissions problem, else it'd be 403, not 404
<annihilannic>	dimitry7: yes but when you call a function like that they are expanded, you can't pass array references. bash is only a shell after all.
<dimitry7>	annihilannic, see my code: http://paste.incorrigible.me/fuqezeqihe.pl
<thejourney>	ayecee, so what the goodness is going on :-)
<ayecee>	thejourney: still not clear on what you changed :)
<thejourney>	ayecee, I haven't changed anything
<calamari>	ayecee: so just the latency of going to the other server is doing it?
<annihilannic>	dimitry7: why not just be naughty and reference the global variables in your function
<calamari>	ayecee: because it works fine locally
<dimitry7>	really?
<dimitry7>	ok let me try
<goldstar>	if I do sudo sh file.sh and I have a command in that file that I dont want to run in sudo, would it be possible to not do so ?
<ayecee>	calamari: are you trying to play the same save file at the same time on more than one computer?
<ayecee>	calamari: or do you play on one, save and quit, then play on the other?
<annihilannic>	goldstar: you mean you want to run one command as a non-privileged user?  is the file.sh running as root?
<k_sze[work]>	Does it make sense at all to allocate swap on a cloud VPS like Linode?
<goldstar>	annihilannic: yes
<k_sze[work]>	They use SSD storage, but still.
<ayecee>	k_sze[work]: i don't see why not.
<calamari>	ayecee: no just one at a time
<annihilannic>	goldstar: well you could just 'su nonprivuser -c whatevercommand' in that script
<ayecee>	calamari: how much latency do you figure there is between saving on one computer and opening it on another?
<k_sze[work]>	How much swap should I allocate for 2GB RAM?
<calamari>	ayecee: sorry, let me "lie" and say there is only a client and server.. forget about all the other computers
<annihilannic>	calamari: why not just rsync the save file to a "master" location before and after running minecraft
<calamari>	ayecee: so I have the computer running minecraft, and I have a computer that I have sshfsed into
<annihilannic>	calamari: wrapped in a startup script or something
<dimitry7>	annihilannic, my god it worked like a charm!!! thanks a lot man! :D
<jelly>	k_sze[work]: as little as possible
<ayecee>	annihilannic: because that's just nasty :P
<kerframil>	k_sze[work]: it really depends on your workload. you could allocate swap as a file, which is easy to subsequent extend, if you need it.
<calamari>	annihilannic: that could work actually
<dimitry7>	annihilannic, I was making my life more complicated... as usual
<kerframil>	k_sze[work]: having a large amount of swap wastes only disk space
<calamari>	annihilannic: thanks for the idea!
<pablo_>	hello guys, is there ant linux usb specific channel?
<ayecee>	pablo_: probably not
<pablo_>	ok
<pablo_>	does somebody knows if lsusb -v lists the Interface Descriptos in order?
<ayecee>	pablo_: in what order?
<calamari>	annihilannic: does rsync allow me to pull from a remote also? I'd want to pull before playing and push after playing
<annihilannic>	pablo_: They are listed in left-to-right based on where you palce the devices on your desk.  :-P
<pablo_>	lol
<reisio>	#kernelnewbies
<FreezingCold>	k_sze[work]: meh, swap sucks
<FreezingCold>	I disabled mine.
<reisio>	calamari: whichever
<FreezingCold>	k_sze[work]: also, use a swapfile, NOT a partition
<FreezingCold>	swap partitions are a bad idea unless you use a silly filesystem like btfs
<pablo_>	lsusb -t lists 6 interfaces for a specific device bur lsusb -v lists 7 Interface Descriptors. Does anybody knows why?
<k_sze[work]>	linux knows to just not use a swap if I remove the swap partition, right?
<reisio>	swap partitions are easier to nuke and use for other things than swap files :)
<TinFox>	Curious, why file over partition? (Not calling you wrong or anything, I genuinely wanna know)
<SirLagz>	swap partitions ? why ?
<reisio>	k_sze[work]: well it's not going to use it if it can't :p
<calamari>	k_sze[work]: yes you don't need it, assuming you have sufficient ram
<SirLagz>	I'd rather a partition over a file so that I don't have to deal with file fragmentation of the swap file
<FreezingCold>	k_sze[work]: don't use a partition.
<reisio>	TinFox: "everything a file" is in general a great idea
<k_sze[work]>	reisio: I mean, I don't have to mess with grub so it boots without a swap partition now, do I?
<reisio>	SirLagz: not sure that'd be an issue
<ayecee>	k_sze[work]: no
<SirLagz>	plus then I can put the swap partition at the fastest bit of the drive
<SirLagz>	reisio: it is for me =/
<reisio>	k_sze[work]: grub doesn't care about swap
<TinFox>	hum
<reisio>	k_sze[work]: it would only matter if, in removing your swap partition you managed to change the partition order or the like
<reisio>	which would be hard
<jelly>	SirLagz: and how much does the drive have to seek to get to the fastest bit?
<ayecee>	SirLagz: since the swapfile doesn't change size, allocating it in one contiguous file is not as hard as you'd think.
<TinFox>	Well it's generally a good philosphy, yeah
*	jelly hides
<calamari>	k_sze[work]: you can also comment it out in your fstab if you're worried
<SirLagz>	ayecee: ah that's true
<TinFox>	I mean, I have a swap partition right now, I don't think that alone is really a reason to dismantle it and switch over to a file though
<SirLagz>	jelly: good question. I don't know
<FreezingCold>	SirLagz: swap partitions are so slow it doesn't matter.
<ayecee>	TinFox: yup, no reason to change it now
<jelly>	swap in zram is amazingly useful.
<pingfloyd>	the swap file isn't going to be more fragmented as it is one contiguous unit
<TinFox>	though I'll keep it in mind and think it through next time I do a fresh install
<pingfloyd>	no more than a swap partition would
<SirLagz>	pingfloyd: that is true, didn't think of that before
<thejourney>	ayecee, what do you reckon?
<ayecee>	SirLagz: i guess the only way it'd be fragmented is if it were allocated on a very full filesystem :)
<pingfloyd>	the performance has been the same between the two since 2.6 kernel
<SirLagz>	ayecee: aaaaand that's where my system is :P
<pingfloyd>	there was a difference before then and it kind of stuck
<pingfloyd>	the idea
<ayecee>	thejourney: i reckon it's time to go over nginx's logs to find out what's happening.
<SirLagz>	ayecee: my systems have small disks because I can't afford bigger ones so I just reuse smaller ones lol
<ayecee>	SirLagz: eh, if it weren't for large media files, a good old 60gb drive would be plenty.
<FreezingCold>	SirLagz: you can also resize your swapfile easily.
<pingfloyd>	I can even see a swap file being advantageous if tend to tweak your swap a lot to your current application.
<FreezingCold>	ayecee: I think my entire Linux install outside of ~/ is like 35GB.
<FreezingCold>	and I have hundreds of huge packages installed.
<FreezingCold>	pingfloyd++
<TinFox>	outside of ~/ things don't tend to get very big
<pingfloyd>	you can also have many and play around with the priorities
<SirLagz>	FreezingCold: I wouldn't want to resize my swapfile though, because then I'd probably run into a situation where my swap file will get fragmented because I have no space left on my drive
<FreezingCold>	SirLagz: huh?
<FreezingCold>	just delete the thing.
<TinFox>	most consumer software, besides games, doesn't tend to be very big. Steam games live in ~, and so does your media typically
<FreezingCold>	create a new file.
<FreezingCold>	done.
<k_sze[work]>	fragmentation doesn't matter on SSD though, does it?
<FreezingCold>	???
<pingfloyd>	SirLagz: you'd want to turn it off first for the container you're manipulating
<TinFox>	So ~ is realistically where most of the average person's big crap is gonna make it's home
<SirLagz>	FreezingCold: delete the swap file...and recreate it onto the same non-contigous space ? :P
<ayecee>	k_sze[work]: right
<SirLagz>	once I get some new hard drives I could probably use swap files
<FreezingCold>	SirLagz: run ext4's defrag tool
<FreezingCold>	e4defrag -v /
<FreezingCold>	done
<FreezingCold>	enjoy
<FreezingCold>	your welcome.
<Penguin>	FreezingCold: you're
<SirLagz>	FreezingCold: my problem is i have no free space in the first place to defrag
<FreezingCold>	Penguin: no, it's his welcome.
<FreezingCold>	SirLagz: stop filling your drives like a disk junkie.
<FreezingCold>	it's not healthy.
<pingfloyd>	SirLagz: you're forgetting that the swap file is contiguous
<SirLagz>	FreezingCold: Sure. Once I get enough drives to move everything over to the NAS
<TinFox>	this is why I have about two and a half terabytes of space on my desktop
<SirLagz>	pingfloyd: it's not when my filesystem is 95% full :(
<FreezingCold>	SirLagz: This is not a swapfile problem, this is a you problem.
<TinFox>	So my file hoarding doesnt become problematic to me
<pingfloyd>	any fragmentation that may happen will not be before of the FS
<SirLagz>	FreezingCold: I'm not saying it is a Swapfile problem, I'm saying it's a "I'm not using swap file becuase I have other problems" problem :P
<pingfloyd>	that the swap file is on, but fragmentation in pages like any swap
<FreezingCold>	SirLagz: by that standard, you should be using Windows because Linux is "too difficult".
*	annihilannic swaps to tape
<FreezingCold>	it's a slippery slope
<SirLagz>	FreezingCold: what ?
<FreezingCold>	one day you're using urxvtc in daemon mode, the next you're complaining about Windows 10's UI.
<FreezingCold>	and then you're shooting heroin.
<FreezingCold>	SirLagz: tl;dr: fix your file system.
<TinFox>	Windows 10's UI is actually not that bad
<SirLagz>	FreezingCold: yes...I admitted that a while ago
<TinFox>	Certainly better than 8's
<FreezingCold>	TinFox: No.
<annihilannic>	Is it a gateway OS?
<FreezingCold>	^
<FreezingCold>	TinFox: Watch, next week you'll be ODing on cocaine. Watch yourself.
<FreezingCold>	first windows 10, then 8, then cocaine. That's how they get all the kids.
<TinFox>	Hey, I was a windows to linux convert.
<FreezingCold>	you don't want to get mixed up in that windows stuff.
<ayecee>	FreezingCold: whew, that takes away the pressure of the student loans, at least.
<TinFox>	I dual boot now because I still need windows for a few things, but I primarily use kubuntu
<FreezingCold>	I hear something like 99% of serial killers use Windows and not Linux.
<TinFox>	I dunno, I've talked to some -really- sketchy linux users
<annihilannic>	Yeah Linux users get caught after the first one.
<reisio>	I hear most of them kill more than one person
<FreezingCold>	TinFox: like what?
<FreezingCold>	reisio: sick fscks.
<thejourney>	ayecee, they are horrid
<thejourney>	didn't get far :-D
<FreezingCold>	ayecee: I tried to apply for student loans, got offered $0 :(
<FreezingCold>	Couldn't even fill out the application
<FreezingCold>	I got denied by their JavaScript.
<TinFox>	FreezingCold: Certain games (though gaming on linux has been getting a lot better), occasionally visual studio (Though hey - microsoft is starting to become pretty accomodating with that too), photoshop
<annihilannic>	FreezingCold: You failed?
<FreezingCold>	annihilannic: too much $$$.
<jelly>	TinFox: aren't they making VS for Linux
<TinFox>	jelly: VSCode, it came out just a few days ago
<annihilannic>	I couldn't get one either.  Some stupid excuse about me not being a student...
<FreezingCold>	household income was close to $200,000 since I was working, and apparently my parents money is considered mine for loan purposes.
<codebam>	if I suspend a script with Ctrl z will it stop running (paused) or be playing in the background?
<annihilannic>	Try telling your parents that ;-)
<TinFox>	I've been using it, pretty pleasantly surprised
<reisio>	FreezingCold: oh, knew someone who was in that situation
<reisio>	FreezingCold: sucks to be you, aren't parents fun?
<FreezingCold>	meh, to be fair I do have access to a lot of it...
<reisio>	heh
<annihilannic>	"Hey, Dad, this loan refusal notice says that all your $$ are mine.  Muahahaha."
<FreezingCold>	if they just used my income of $40k I would have gotten tons of money.
<TinFox>	lets me have some of what I love from VS while still being able to be in my more comfortable linux ecyosystem
<FreezingCold>	cause I didn't make crap last year, the joys of being 18.
<annihilannic>	codebam: it will be suspended until you 'bg' it
<annihilannic>	codebam: or send it a SIGCONT
<FreezingCold>	Anyone used the Visual Basic compiler for Linux? Tempted to try it.
<TinFox>	FreezingCold: That involves using visual basic though :(
<annihilannic>	FreezingCold: There are medications for that
<FreezingCold>	annihilannic: Visual Basic?
<annihilannic>	FreezingCold: no, not making crap.
<FreezingCold>	TinFox: meh, a lot of bots are programmed in VB.
<TinFox>	FreezingCold: Indeed. There's an excellent pill for your VB, it's called C#
<TinFox>	take a dose or two and you'll see those VB symptoms start to fade
<reisio>	zzzz, don't suppose anyones compared encfs and truecrypt speed?
<reisio>	anyoneses'es
<pingfloyd>	FreezingCold: that means they claimed you as a dependent, try after they year they haven't claimed you.
<TinFox>	isn't truecrypt abandoned?
<FreezingCold>	pingfloyd: it's not worth it. If my father claims me, he basically gets 46.4% of any amount I claim back.
<pingfloyd>	FreezingCold: have them take out the loan, or quit claiming you as a dependent.
<pingfloyd>	FreezingCold: then he should be willing to put up a loan for you if you want to go to school.
<FreezingCold>	He is. I just don't like being a leech, I'd rather pay it back.
<codebam>	annihilannic: so will that mess up my ssh-keygen -T?
<pingfloyd>	you're his son and he should want to see you succeed if he is a good parent
<reisio>	TinFox: it lives on in a couple forks
<TinFox>	oh, good
<reisio>	well, it's useful at least, if you have old truecrypt volumes to access
<TinFox>	yeah
<reisio>	although I don't think the truecrypt packages are going anywhere anytime soon
<reisio>	fine I'll test it myself!
<reisio>	jerkholes! :D
<annihilannic>	codebam: errr.... what?  is that the process you are suspending?
<TinFox>	bleeeehhhh
<codebam>	annihilannic: its verifying my new moduli
<TinFox>	This SFTP is taking ages
<TinFox>	and it's over my local network
<codebam>	takes a REALLY long timr
*	annihilannic shrugs
<reisio>	TinFox: 'cause you're using Windows
<annihilannic>	codebam: dunno, never used that.  but it shouldn't.
<reisio>	you need that hpn-ssh
<codebam>	can someone test it for me...?
<reisio>	also, may as well disable encryption on your local network
<codebam>	or actually. I'll do it myslef
<reisio>	what's it do?
<TinFox>	reisio: Well, version shouldnt be saying I'm on windows
<codebam>	myself
<reisio>	TinFox: heh
<annihilannic>	codebam: yeah, jerkhole!  :-)
<TinFox>	I'm connected through a bouncer
<codebam>	annihilannic: lol sorry :p
<reisio>	poor bouncer
<TinFox>	Though I am in fact on windows at the moment. Entirely because I was playing cards earlier
<reisio>	cards ftw
<codebam>	seems to work without issue
<codebam>	now... could I move that bg process to another tty... or preferably a tmux session?
<naptr>	probably, you must stop it before moving it.
<annihilannic>	codebam: move it using what, reptyr?
<codebam>	annihilannic: I'm not sure... can I do that?
*	MonkehParade is now known as Coookies
<pingfloyd>	cards would probably run good in vm
*	codebam pulls WiFi dongle out of rpi to download this reptyr
<naptr>	sounds useful. i can think of a dozen times i've needed something like retty/retyr =)
<annihilannic>	thank reisio for that one
<codebam>	what's the difference between the 2?
<ForTheWin>	t
<reisio>	retty's a new one to me
<reisio>	its homepage gives me the impression reptyr is more mature/comprehensive
*	reisio shrugs
<reisio>	another one, dupx, most people prefer reptyr over that, too
<codebam>	yea reptyr seems popular
<reisio>	the docs for it make it seem quite well thought out
<reisio>	but they probably all "work"
<reisio>	obliviously :p
<Soupralead>	I get a weird installation environment for Debian? I created a bootable USB with Debian in it and then when I reboot and try to install it I get to a blue screen with few options and then an error that "No bootable ISO found on a harddriver" or something like that.
<Soupralead>	What's wrong?
<codebam>	and 0.02mb. nice
<codebam>	shit... it has subprocesses. how do I do this?
<codebam>	sorry.
<codebam>	... I can't attach.
<codebam>	and its disowned
<annihilannic>	:-(
<fred1807>	this is very strange, when I sync my bucket to my local folder (actually a folder on a remote server) all the files became the same.  Yes, it is a folder of .mp3 files, and all of the downloaded mp3 are actually the same (same audio, same tags). Of course they are no the same at source, this using s3cmd lci
<annihilannic>	Soupralead: You created your bootable USB how?  Using what image?
<codebam>	well I can do top. and wait until it completes
<codebam>	can I log out of X without the process dying?
<annihilannic>	codebam: depends on the process
<toothe>	anyone know where kmail stores its configuration files?
<annihilannic>	codebam: some processes die on SIGTSTOP (I think?) if they try to write output to a nonexistent terminal
<codebam>	annihilannic: hmm. so I probably shouldn't kill X
<annihilannic>	codebam: SIGTTOU I was thinking of
<codebam>	or that terminal lol
<adsjlkdk>	reisio i got gentoo to boot
<diegoviola>	I can't just get used to GNOME 3
*	diegoviola sighs
<diegoviola>	I always go back to Xfce
<diegoviola>	I wonder why that is?
<codebam>	i3 :)
<adsjlkdk>	i prefer window managers
<reisio>	adsjlkdk: gj
<reisio>	diegoviola: 'cause compared to gnome xfce is heavenly
<adsjlkdk>	but im still barely right here https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Finalizing i havent started tht yet
<diegoviola>	reisio: meaning?
<codebam>	too bad reptyr can't grab subprocesses
<reisio>	gnome bites?
<[R]>	REPTAR
<adsjlkdk>	and i used genkernel so i cheated
<reisio>	codebam: use /usr/sbin/magicbullet
<TinFox>	diegoviola: You're comfortable with it and it's provided a consistent experience for you?
<diegoviola>	reisio: I don't know, I just feel I'm faster on Xfce, but gnome is prettier
<reisio>	[R]: eptyr
<adsjlkdk>	i cheated!!!!!!!
<diegoviola>	TinFox: sure
<codebam>	reisio: thanks I'll check that out.
<reisio>	diegoviola: they can look and function exactly alike
<diegoviola>	reisio: gnome and xfce?
<TinFox>	I use KDE or MATE
<reisio>	yup
<reisio>	TinFox: I see a patter
<reisio>	->n
<diegoviola>	reisio: indeed they can... but I prefer the way Xfce handles virtual desktops
<reisio>	those can work the same, too
<reisio>	but Xfce is better regardless :)
<diegoviola>	reisio: it's easier to switch between desktops with Ctrl + F1, F2, etc
<reisio>	that's configurable for any DE, really
<diegoviola>	reisio: on Xfce than on gnome: Ctrl + Alt + Page up/down, etc
<reisio>	I use CTRL+ALT+left/right arrow for that
<diegoviola>	reisio: Yeah I just don't have time to mess around with configuration right now, Xfce defaults work fine for me as of now
<goldstar>	my webserver runs as the nginx-w user; I have another user called jenkins which ssh's into the server to update the webroot files. Problem is it changes ownership of the files and I need to give it chown to fix that. Is there anything wrong with giving the nginx-w user a shell and sshing into it via jenkins set the webroot files? that way I wont need to mess with sudoers or ownership issues
<reisio>	well interesting
<diegoviola>	reisio: or maybe I don't have time to get used to GNOME 3 right now
<reisio>	on Windows anyway, encfs is slightly faster than veracrypt/truecrypt
<diegoviola>	reisio: I'll keep trying until I'm comfortable with it
<reisio>	think I would've gone with it even if it were slower, though :)
<reisio>	diegoviola: why bother, Xfce is great
<reisio>	and its devs aren't insane/betraying/looney
<codebam>	reisio: was that a joke, or is that an actual package?
<codebam>	I can't find it
<diegoviola>	reisio: heh
<diegoviola>	reisio: I wish development on Xfce were faster though
<reisio>	codebam: joke
<diegoviola>	reisio: for things like bug fixes and such
<reisio>	oh? I find it pretty darn fast
<codebam>	ah okay
<codebam>	lol
<reisio>	and they fix/progress things rather than remaking everything to be worse (/me looks at gnome)
<diegoviola>	GNOME 3 is nice looking, AlternateTab fixed one of my annoyances
<proprietarysucks>	sorry but I used to love kde and then they turned it into kde vista and forced me out... that's when I discovered xfce, which I find refreshing
<diegoviola>	my other annoyance with is with virtual desktops, I need a faster way to send windows to a specific desktop and switch between them
<diegoviola>	Ctrl + Alt + Page Up/Down is slowing me down
<reisio>	you can make any version of kde or gnome look like any other version of kde/gnome, but why put yourself through that
<diegoviola>	Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Page Up/Down
<annihilannic>	reisio: do any of those enc fs options work for android devices?
<reisio>	while I'm comparing default encfs prefs vs veracrypt, I guess I should remark that veracrypt's defaults have more paranoia, and with encfs you opt-in to more paranoia
<reisio>	but still, faster
<reisio>	annihilannic: good question, but you'd need a file manager worth using on android, too, heh
<reisio>	http://code.google.com/p/cryptonite/
<reisio>	google feeling lucky result
<reisio>	sounds promising
<annihilannic>	reisio: I find ES File Manager pretty groovy
<annihilannic>	reisio: thanks
<reisio>	yeah I should really check it out myself
<reisio>	all sorts of cruft on my phone :p
<annihilannic>	reisio: lol @ the "I haven't had any backdoor requests yet" comment...
<reisio>	heh
*	braincrash is now known as braincras
<reisio>	how's andLinux?
<adsjlkdk>	can there be a directory and a file with the same name in the same directory
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	I keep getting an error. org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.AccessDenied: Connection ":1.79" is not allowed to own the service "org.fedoraProject.Setroubleshootd" due to security  policies in the configuration file.
<annihilannic>	adsjlkdk: no
<reisio>	probably depends on the FS, but no, not really
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	adsjlkdk, you can append a space to one.
<reisio>	that would mean really they'd have different names :)
<reisio>	although, I wonder how unionfs/et al. handle same names
<annihilannic>	reisio: Good point, we could be talking about VMS here... :S
<reisio>	they must somehow
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	annihilannic, probably not. Se,icolons in names are not a good idea. Probably a .1 and a .2 or .dev1 .dev.2
<adsjlkdk>	in /etc/portage/ i have package.use/ but i also need a package.use file! what do i do
<ayecee>	adsjlkdk: why do you need a package.use file?
*	FreezingCold yawns.
<adsjlkdk>	it says so here https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Sakaki%27s_EFI_Install_Guide/Setting_up_the_GNOME_3_Desktop
<annihilannic>	MouseTheLuckyDog: Coudln't agree more!
<ayecee>	adsjlkdk: 20:42 < stanford_drone> Our startup got funded! We're going to Shenzhen, China
<ayecee>	                        to build a personal gaming drone. This is a flying

<adsjlkdk>	thanks
<ayecee>	adsjlkdk: are there other files in the dir already?
<Cthulchu>	hey, fellas, could you please suggest me an antivirus for Debian. I got listed in spamhouse for participating in a botnet. I need a console antivirus.
<pclover>	Cthulchu, reinstall
<CHVNX>	If you were pwnd, you must reinstall. There is no way to be sure you were not pwnd beyond repair.
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	Cthulchu, are you sure the router isn't compromised?
<Cthulchu>	I'm quite sure the router is OK. I'm renting this VDS
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	There are two programs chkrootkit and rkhunter, Don't know how good they are. Also enable SELinux and use tripwire or AIDE. Especially from a bootdisk.
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	Also how did you get listed?
<Cthulchu>	It's gonna be too complex to reinstall... I have lots of configs there :(
<Cthulchu>	Thanks! I'll try
<Cthulchu>	idk, I can't find anything suspicious in my mail logs
<Cthulchu>	it's just says that... well, I can make a screenshot
<Cthulchu>	http://i.imgur.com/8SjcU1r.png
<Cthulchu>	I removed it from the list, but I think it'll reappear
<Cthulchu>	soon
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	Static or dynamic IP?
<Cthulchu>	wow chkrootkit found an infected `bindshell'
<Cthulchu>	static, of course
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	Oooh. Real malware in the wild.
<Cthulchu>	Port 465 :)
<zZultan>	the davinci virus?
<Cthulchu>	oh, actually, it's common for my panel
<Cthulchu>	I use ISPmanager
<Cthulchu>	lol :)
<adsjlkdk>	do any of you odd people also use genkernel
<naptr>	how about the even people?
<adsjlkdk>	yaeh those too
<Cthulchu>	I like rkhunter
<Cthulchu>	It's colored :)
<Cthulchu>	Ok, anyway. I think the fact of me being blacklisted can be explained with the expired ssl sertificate...
<Cthulchu>	I don't bother :)
<Cthulchu>	but rkhunter is great! thank you!
<reisio>	rkhunter is useless :D
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	Cthulchu, I would first see if you get blacklisted again.  THen I would try top shutdown all networking and run netstat. Don't know if that will work though.
<Cthulchu>	I can't close the server. It hosts quite important web assets. Mail is minor service. I can use a third party service for mailing. It's just I like having everything in one place :)
<adsjlkdk>	what are some cool stories about linux
<tiox>	Odd question, but bear with me; Is there any place in the Linux fiilesystem where files and links can be placed without needing to be in /usr/lib?
<adsjlkdk>	i remember there was one about a kid who used linux and they said it was a hacking operating system
<ayecee>	tiox: how do you mean?
<tiox>	I mean, put there, and read by an application as if it were in /usr/lib without needing to chroot or anything fancy?
<adsjlkdk>	http://www.adequacy.org/stories/2001.12.2.42056.2147.html
<SirLagz>	adsjlkdk: that was a good laugh.
<SirLagz>	lunix. heh.
<ayecee>	tiox: still not sure what you mean. do you have an example?
<tiox>	Because I have a program I want to use with libraries that conflict, and I know it works so I put the libraries in their own folder in /opt and it works if I link them into where the application expects things to be.
<FreezingCold>	adsjlkdk: "one"?
<FreezingCold>	I get called a hacker every time some idiot seems me using bash.
<Cthulchu>	reisio, could you please suggest some worthy console software for scanning?
<adsjlkdk>	id call you a noob for using bash irl i use zsh
<tiox>	It does work, I just want to know if there is a place in the filesystem by default I can put these files in without tampering with the root-privilege portion of the system.
<SirLagz>	Cthulchu: scanning what ?
<FreezingCold>	Cthulchu: antivirus? calmav
<adsjlkdk>	jk
<ayecee>	*clamav
<FreezingCold>	*clamav
<FreezingCold>	ayecee: damn you.
<reisio>	Cthulchu: what scanner?
<FreezingCold>	adsjlkdk: zsh sucks
<FreezingCold>	bash4lyfe
<SirLagz>	tiox: you can change the path that an application looks in for libraries
<FreezingCold>	tiox: you really should fix your package instead of resorting to hackiness
<ayecee>	tiox: there's not a location like that, but you can set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the dir, or possibly load them using LD_PRELOAD
<SirLagz>	that's it, LD_LIBRARY_PATH was what I was thinking of
<reisio>	Cthulchu: oh for "rootkits"?
<reisio>	Cthulchu: it's a lost cause I'm afraid
<reisio>	reinstall and use AIDE or the like
<tiox>	Ah. Well, my problem is I don't want to repack files I want to use because... honestly I am still a bit green and I don't want to break something just because I did some repackaging.
<reisio>	rkhunter will just eat up your time and not help you
<tiox>	My OS is multiarch but the stuff I want to install wants to replace pre-existing files, which is why apt wants to remove them in favour of what I would like to install because 64-bit versions of some libraries exist.
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	reisio, and SELinux.
<reisio>	selinux is for another problem altogether
<reisio>	waste of time for non-servers, IMO
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	OMG: "If your son has requested a new "processor" from a company called "AMD", this is genuine cause for alarm. AMD is a third-world based company who make inferior, "knock-off" copies of American processor chips. "
<reisio>	heh
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	reisio, he's running a server.
<reisio>	still for another problem altogether
<dtrott>	hey, I can convert virtual image files from qcow2 to raw format with using qemu-img then I can mount the guest partions on the host using kpartx, is there any way to manipulate qcow2 images directly without needing to convert them ?
<Canadian1296>	I have a long list of names, each on its own line, and I want to keep the first letter of each name but replace the rest with asterisks. (Ex. John Smith -> J*** S****) Suggestions on what command to use?
<ayecee>	dtrott: to mount them? no
<kerframil>	adsjlkdk: please tell me that is satire
<[R]>	Canadian1296: perl regex
<dtrott>	ayecee: :-( thanks the for the confirmation at least I can stop my search ...
<SirLagz>	kerframil: are you reading that adequacy.org link ?
<kerframil>	SirLagz: ya
<adsjlkdk>	kerrframil its satire
<SirLagz>	kerframil: you'd hope it's satire lol. I never found out for sure whether it was Satire or not
<Canadian1296>	[R], I'll google some info on it, thanks
<ayecee>	dtrott: looks like you can use qemu-nbd to present the qcow2 file as a block device. hadn't seen that before.
<dtrott>	groking
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	Ok towards the end of the file, I have got to believe it is an April's fool joke.
<MetaNova>	MouseTheLuckyDog: you should have stopped reading at "third world"
<MetaNova>	AMD is a Canadian company, last I checked
<[R]>	MetaNova: may as well be the third world...
<[R]>	with their floppy heads and all
<MetaNova>	Southpark reference? I'll allow it
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	MetaNove, never underestimate peoples stupidity. It's when you look at the source of Linux, BSD etc. that suggests it's someone making this up and not some moron who really believes it.
<Canadian1296>	[R], I have my regex statement done, but I'm confused about how to leave the first character and only replace the rest.
<[R]>	Canadian1296: that sounds unfortunate...
<kerframil>	Canadian1296: what does your statement look like at present?
<dtrott>	ayecee: Grr so looks like I have to compile the kernel module (Centos 7) the question is do I want to bother or just convert the dam image format ;-)
<ayecee>	doh
<Canadian1296>	kerframil, I am looking to replace digits in employee number first, so regex is "\d(\d+),". This finds the whole number, but the capture group only includes all but the first digit
<ayecee>	Canadian1296: isn't there a 0-character word separator match? \b, i think
<dtrott>	Canadian1296: Can I also ask about your choice of the * character using - or _ would probably be a lot less pain to escape later ...
<Canadian1296>	An example of one line of the string would be: "123456, John Doe, 12345678901". I need "12****, J*** D***, ****5678****"
<dtrott>	do you have to match the * count it would be much easier to get:  12*, J* D*, *5678*
<Canadian1296>	dtrott, matching the count would be preferable, but I could do without it
<kerframil>	Canadian1296: you're not going to be able to shoehorn your requirement into one regex but it's a fairly trivial problem
<proprietarysucks>	so you're trying to keep the first x digits and then replace the remaining?
<Canadian1296>	kerframil, more than one statement is okay, I only need to use it once on a very long file
<dtrott>	Canadian1296: My simplyfied requirements “probably” can be shoehorned into one reg-ex but I agree with kerframil the full multi * version probably isn’t shoehornable (is that a word)?
<Canadian1296>	proprietarysucks, yes, for each group (comma separated, except first and last names)
<Canadian1296>	dtrott, even a series of replacements would be fine. I'm just trying to do this to one file, once
<Cthulchu>	Ok, guys, please suggest me something else like rkhunter and chkrootkit. I'm making a review now :)
<dtrott>	Canadian1296: The best I can come up with is 4 replacements a) Tokenize the whole string ABC —> <A><B><C>    b) Update the tokens for the ones you want to keep [A][B]<C>   c) nuke the rest [A][B]*  d) untokenize
<dtrott>	Actually you can combine steps b) and d) so you only need three steps
<Canadian1296>	dtrott, that seems like a good solution
<kerframil>	Canadian1296: if the third field always the same length?
<proprietarysucks>	well let me show you what I would do
<Canadian1296>	kerframil, first and third fields are always the same length. middle one changes
<proprietarysucks>	not really paying that much attention but in python I might use (\d{2})([^,]*), (.)([^ ]*) (.)([^ ,]*), (\d{4})(\d{4})(\d{3}) if the info was always the same format
<proprietarysucks>	you can test here https://regex101.com/
*	zach_d is now known as Fangs|Zaaaach
<proprietarysucks>	welcome to your new favorite website if you use regex
<dtrott>	proprietarysucks: I am guess not everyones name is the same length, but a good try never the less.....
<proprietarysucks>	names can be any length with that
<Canadian1296>	proprietarysucks, that looks awesome, it matches exactly the way I need it to and splits the capture groups properly
<proprietarysucks>	change it to this if you want people to be able to have middle names (but not have to): (\d{2})([^,]*), (.)([^ ]*) (.)([^ ,]*)? ?(.)([^ ,]*), (\d{4})(\d{4})(\d{3})
*	Fangs|Zaaaach is now known as zach_d
<dtrott>	proprietarysucks: But how do you substitue * for the variable length portions ?
<Loshki>	Canadian1296: what if my name were Jose Luis Maria Jesus Goldenberg?
<proprietarysucks>	I don't know what language you're using but in python you get all the groups by position
<dtrott>	I would suggest changing it ...
<dtrott>	:-P
<proprietarysucks>	sorry that second one is a bit off, use the first one if you are restricting to single first and last name
<Canadian1296>	Loshki, that appears to break the regex :P
<kerframil>	Canadian1296: https://clbin.com/sxiPg
*	zach_d is now known as punkrockzach
<kerframil>	outputs:
<kerframil>	1*****, J*** D**, ****5678***
<kerframil>	6*****, J** J****, ****7654***
*	punkrockzach is now known as Zach-Senpai
*	dtrott really has to spend the time to learn perl at some point ...
*	proprietarysucks is happy about his change from perl to python :)
<Canadian1296>	kerframil, that works beautifully. I just don't know much/any perl, so it's magic to me haha
<kerframil>	Canadian1296: you can replace the for statement with: while (my $line = <STDIN>)
<kerframil>	Canadian1296: then feed in your content with a pipe
<proprietarysucks>	you can just use a regex in that site I pasted
<proprietarysucks>	and then click generate code, and pick a language ;)
<Canadian1296>	proprietarysucks, that's awesome, didn't notice that
<Canadian1296>	kerframil, thanks, that I can do haha
<Canadian1296>	What's the regex character for a newline?
<ayecee>	\n, probably
<ayecee>	though if you're using sed that won't matter.
<dtrott>	But you need to be careful some RegEx engines break on new lines
<Canadian1296>	ayecee, wow that was obvious haha
<ayecee>	heh
<Canadian1296>	dtrott, I'm guessing I'm best off feeding it one line at a time?
<dtrott>	Just like a good comedy show…. ;-)
<kerframil>	Canadian1296: I didn't see the point in trying to get clever with regex. you have consistency in your input data (except for the name column) and the transformation can be chosen based on the index of the column being processed.
<kerframil>	Canadian1296: that's the road I went down
<kerframil>	Canadian1296: dealing with the name was the only tricky part
*	Z_ is now known as Guest93999
<Canadian1296>	kerframil, I think I'm going to use the perl you sent me
<Canadian1296>	I would mess around more with regex, but it seems silly when there's a working solution in front of me right noe :P
<kerframil>	Canadian1296: https://clbin.com/JDsnI (with stdin processing)
<Canadian1296>	kerframil, awesome. One modification, it's okay if you don't want to do it. How would I change the first column from "123456" to "1****6" (instead of all stars)?
<Canadian1296>	It seems like it'd be more complicated
<kerframil>	Canadian1296: we know it's fixed length so, first of all, change it to match like: m/^(.)....(.)/;
<Canadian1296>	Done
<kerframil>	Canadian1296: note how it has capturing parentheses for the first and last char
<Canadian1296>	I'm guessing those become $1 and $2?
<kerframil>	Canadian1296: yep
<Canadian1296>	kerframil, cool, I think I got this :D
<HulkSmash>	what do knowledgeable geeks like you folks think about http://fifth-browser.sourceforge.net/? i'm looking for a gplv3 browser for linux
<ayecee>	 
<ayecee>	doh
<hassoon>	bah
<dtrott>	HulkSmash: I doubt the “Supreme Leader approves”  ;-)
<Sementa>	Hey, is openSUSE suitable for programming?
<neonstorm>	sure
<Sementa>	Any other recommendations?
<SirLagz>	anything is suitable for programming
<dtrott>	Though probably not for iPhone programming ;-)
<neonstorm>	just pick the one you like and are comfy in
<Canadian1296>	Mac for iOS programming, Windows for Windows, your preferred linux distro for everything else :P
<Sementa>	I installed Debian with lxde and nothing works lol
<Sementa>	..
<neonstorm>	what are you trying to program?
<SirLagz>	Sementa: define "nothing" and "works"
<Canadian1296>	Sementa, what exactly doesn't work?
<Sementa>	I guess it's because I downloaded the CD version
<dtrott>	SirLagz: I was going to go with define nothing :-)
<SirLagz>	dtrott: heh
<dtrott>	ha ha:  #define nothing
<Sementa>	I don't want much stuff really. A web browser, a terminal and that's all about it. Let me know if you have recommendations.
<neonstorm>	maybe you should try ubuntu
<Sementa>	I have been running ubuntu for the past few months.
<hassoon>	Sementa: see a minimalist distro
<dtrott>	Sementa: so where did the programming question come from then ?
<neonstorm>	are you going to tell us what was broken or not
<Sementa>	neonstorm: nvm it
<neonstorm>	right-o
<Sementa>	Any of you using a minimalistic distro?
<ayecee>	not for day to day use
<SirLagz>	I'm using Debian which can be minimalistic...
<neonstorm>	when i need it, yes
<Sementa>	neonstorm: When you need it?
<neonstorm>	yes i have a vm for when i need linux running a minimalistic distro :P
<neonstorm>	i work in It and don't get to use linux primarily, but still use it
<Canadian1296>	Sementa: dual-booting Xubuntu on my Macbook, Pidora (Fedora spin) on my Raspberry Pi, and CentOS 7 on my two servers.
<Canadian1296>	I have a love/hate relationship with Arch.
<neonstorm>	yeah...it's nice to just use antergos when you don't have time to spare for spinning up a new vm
<Sementa>	How's the openbsd?
<SpiceMan>	it's not linux
<Sementa>	Or the bsd family in general.
<SpiceMan>	tias
<Canadian1296>	never used it, I've stuck to linux
<kerframil>	neonstorm: that looks interesting. what's the USP, just a streamline installer?
<kerframil>	streamlined*
<andrew39>	someone was telling me they spent 2 weeks trying to setup something in freebsd
<andrew39>	and i can set it up in under a minute in linux
<Canadian1296>	andrew39, maybe they just aren't very good with bsd?
<neonstorm>	kerframil: yes it's just a streamlined installer with a bare minimum of things that you choose to start with.
<andrew39>	Canadian1296, i don't know, that was my first impression.... but i wouldn't know, never used freebsd myself
<kerframil>	neonstorm: but still using the same package repos as arch?
<neonstorm>	kerframil: yep, it's not a spin off like mandrake etc
<kerframil>	neonstorm: neat
<Canadian1296>	andrew39, yeah, I've also never used it. Can't say really
<kerframil>	neonstorm: your point about setting up something quickly in a VM resonates
<diegoviola>	why does gnome pisses me off every time I try it
<andrew39>	because gnome 3+ is garbage
<diegoviola>	heh
<neonstorm>	kerframil: for sure. I totally support learning how to do it all properly of course but automation is always a boon.
<diegoviola>	andrew39: I have to remake shortcuts to make it at least half usable, but it does get in the way a lot
<diegoviola>	s/remake/remap/
<calamari>	Sementa: I've not tried it.. but this browser doesn't need X: http://www.netsurf-browser.org/about/
<andrew39>	diegoaguilar, try mate if want gnome 2 back
<calamari>	Sementa: if you can pull off a static build of that, then you might be in busybox territory. that'd be pretty minimal
<calamari>	:)
<annihilannic>	diegoviola: you've been whining about gnome for 3 days now, just use something else!
<andrew39>	i can't blame him... it's that bad
<calamari>	oh, someone already mentioned mate :)
<dtrott>	In Centos 7 whats the “new” way to do MAKEDEV it appears to have been removed but I am not sure what its replacement is.
<calamari>	my theory of gnome is this: it was always better in the past. that's because they had a philosophy of removing options and choosing what they considered to be a sane default. but of course anyone who chose differently is now inconvenienced
<dtrott>	calamari: You also forgot the new “features” that only get in the way such as the “splash screen that you have to swipe out of the way”
<dn4>	my theory is anything that uses d-bus; is garbage
<calamari>	the gnome that shipped with ubuntu warty was pretty great
<calamari>	dtrott: and recently used :(
<dn4>	did linux already add D-bus to the kernel?
<Canadian1296>	dtrott, I'm honestly not sure, I googled it and couldn't find an answer.
<calamari>	the cool thing about MATE (at least so far), is they are content to leave gnome the way it is for the most part
<andrew39>	calamari, your theory doesn't only apply to gnome ;)
<Canadian1296>	dtrott, (about MAKEDEV)
<dtrott>	Canadian1296: Thx I figured it out just before your second comment.
<andrew39>	for instance, i am amazed at just how horrible and useless the new google maps has become
<calamari>	andrew39: until the kde devs went insane and made KDE 4, I always thought KDE got better with each release
<annihilannic>	andrew39: and inappropriate for wide screens... which nearly *every* device has now
<calamari>	andrew39: oh yes.. google always destroys their apps
<dtrott>	calamari: I think its when the project managers realize there is a user base that “needs” guidance that, that happens.
<dtrott>	Until the apps get popular the devs run the roost ...
<calamari>	I've never figured out why they don't just put in a switch for "advanced mode"
<dtrott>	I asked that question once, the answer was if there is an option then people expect it to work so they have to spend dev time maintaining it.
<calamari>	then they can simplify to the extreme and still have the good version for those that aren't afraid of computers
<calamari>	yes thats true
<calamari>	there's always more code to write and test than hours in the day, esp when you're not getting paid!
<Canadian1296>	Has anyone used Pidora? I'm trying to install libtool, but the version in the Pidora repo requires gcc-4.8.3. The repo's gcc is only 4.8.2...
<andrew39>	i think the right philosophy should be: "if you dont know how to use it, you shouldn't be using it"
<dtrott>	calamari: I suspect the google developers are paid...
<dtrott>	And they have 20% time
<calamari>	that's the way I've always treated the programs I write
<andrew39>	let me correct that, it should be "if you dont know how to use it and arent willing to learn, you shouldnt be using it"
<Canadian1296>	I'm just not sure how to update it, since the Pi is armv6hl
<SirLagz>	Canadian1296: what are you trying to do to a Pi ?
<calamari>	I give them the documentation and I don't try to pander
<dn4>	since linux is open source; is it illegal to sell hacks to backdoor the kernel ?
<dtrott>	dn4: You can sell any open source software you just can’t tell others not to copy it.
<andrew39>	sell, no, but probably you have to release the code
<Canadian1296>	SirLagz, it's running Pidora (based on Fedora 20). I'm trying to install Ruby 1.9.3 for metasploit framework at the moment.
<calamari>	and if you're making it available gotta provide the source
<dn4>	hmm two conflicting answers are given
<dtrott>	dn4 you can sell people the code
<dn4>	I think dtrott is correct and andrew39 is wrong
<andrew39>	dn4, when i said "sell, no" i meant, "no, its not illegal to sell"
<calamari>	dn4: you can sell linux.. but why would anyone buy it when they can get it for free?
<SirLagz>	Canadian1296: ah i see
<dtrott>	calamari: I think RedHat tried that idea once ;-)
<ayecee>	the same reason people buy games that they can pirate for free
<ayecee>	or at least one of the reasons
<dn4>	redhat created D-bus
<ayecee>	if you pay for it, and it breaks, you can demand your money back :D
<calamari>	dtrott: I thought the idea of redhat is that a company was providing support .. maybe I misunderstood
<dn4>	they covered up the creator of D-bus a while back
<Romance>	calamari: i used to sell a cd of ubuntu to few people because they dont have time to download it
<SirLagz>	ayecee: and the vendor will screw you over anyway :P
<dtrott>	ayecee: Are you mean pay for support that you don’t actually get !!!
<Canadian1296>	SirLagz, yeah, rbenv wants libtool, and libtool wants updated gcc.
<SirLagz>	Canadian1296: I'm not a user of Pidora unfortunately. I'm a Raspbian user :P
<dtrott>	calamari: RHEL is open source software packaged with commerical “updating” software, the OSS bits are free but you would need to strip the rest of the Redhat bits, hence you would be left with Centos ;-)
<calamari>	ayecee: that's different (games).. if I sell a copy of linux, then Linus isn't getting a percentage. if I pirate a game, then the people relying on the sale have now been hurt
<Canadian1296>	SirLagz, I think it would be easier for me if I switched. I'm using Pidora because I'm more familiar with Fedora/CentOS (systemd, rpms, etc)
<SirLagz>	Raspbian is probably using systemd now if they've caught up with Debian
<SirLagz>	I haven't looked in a little while
<Canadian1296>	SirLagz, I'll have to check!
<ayecee>	calamari: it's not an identical situation, sure. but that's not the reasoning i was talking about.
<andrew39>	Canadian1296, i tried pidora couple years ago, it was too broken
<SirLagz>	Canadian1296: raspbian has apt-get, which is the equivalent of yum
<andrew39>	sound was broken
<ayecee>	calamari: it's that when you buy a game from, say, steam, you're more likely to get a working product without hidden gotchas than, say, downloading a random torrent for same.
<andrew39>	had bunch of other issues with it too dont remember what
<ayecee>	calamari: in part, you're paying for the reputation of the delivering agent.
<calamari>	ayecee: there is definitely value in providing compilations, updates, packages, etc.. I wouldn't necessarily be upset if I had to pay for ubuntu updates
<Canadian1296>	SirLagz, yeah, I use Xubuntu on my Mac. I might have to switch to raspbian
<dtrott>	calamari: The question is how much RHEL for 2 sockets is $799 per year https://www.redhat.com/wapps/store/catalog.html
<calamari>	companies are afraid to get something that doesn't have support, that isn't considered standard and reliable
<calamari>	the place I work won't use google offerings for that reason
<Canadian1296>	calamari, that's perfectly fair if any downtime costs you tons of money
<calamari>	yep
<dtrott>	Canadian1296: the issue is when it does go down does the support contract actually help ...
<ayecee>	dtrott: it does.
<ayecee>	dtrott: that's how they keep selling support contracts.
<dtrott>	ayecee: You must work are a very large company then.
<dtrott>	I have found for smaller companies its cheaper just to pay for specific fixes..
<calamari>	dn4: maybe there's already a back door in the kernel.. ask the NSA ;)
<dtrott>	For a while we were paying a postgres developer to forward port a non standard feature.
<annihilannic>	dtrott: it's a bit challenging to *find* those fixes though when you don't have full access to their knowledgebase
<Canadian1296>	honestly I would think if uptimes matters that much you'd invest in at least one good sysadmin
<annihilannic>	dtrott: I think RH support is good value
<dn4>	calamari: the kernel has been backdoored a long time ago
<ayecee>	Canadian1296: as opposed to what?
<Canadian1296>	ayecee, I suppose RHEL's support, but RHEL's support is definitely cheaper
<Canadian1296>	*RH's support
<dtrott>	Depends how many machine you have when you are running > 10K machines the price can add up.
<Canadian1296>	dtrott, true
<ayecee>	there's a value to breadth as well. a situation that an average syadmin encounters once or twice in his career, the RH folks will have encountered dozens of times just by supporting so many sites.
<dtrott>	again point of scale there are issues some companies encounter regularly that the RHEL guys almost never see
<annihilannic>	And if there's a bug that requires fixing/porting into their kernel, no matter how "good admin" you are, you're still going to get Red Hat to do it surely.
<annihilannic>	The roles of vendor support and the system admin are different
<dtrott>	Yea thats the real reason you pay for support so when you need your patch in the standard distro it gets done.
<hay207>	hi guys, how about a fail-safe method to forgetting user password?
<iflema>	hay207: username: username password: password

<iflema>	dtrott: im not sure if root is handy of dangerious

<hay207>	how root works? if username has administrative account type
<dtrott>	root = god
<dtrott>	everyone else is peon's
<iflema>	hay207: you *could* shut it down
<EriC^^>	hay207: you could write a backdoor if you want
<dtrott>	Unless you encrypt the drive all linux systems are trivially easy to recover with physical access
<iflema>	s/linux//
<dtrott>	iflema: I still prefer recovering linux systems, boot from CD, mount the root partion edit /etc/passwd done
<iflema>	dtrott: too long

<gogasan>	Hi. I'm trying to compile linux kernel. So how I can to select all awailiable drivers to compile as modules?
<dtrott>	gogasan: You may not want to do that any drivers you need to mount your root filesystem need to be compiled into the kernel
<gogasan>	dtrott: Thanks for answering! I mean, i need all awailiable drivers compiled as modules except fs/block/display drivers that required for normal boot. So problem is: I have a prestigio visconte quad, and i don't know, which drivers are required to use touchescreen, so I decided to build kernel with all drivers awailiable to try enable touchscreen support.

<dtrott>	No problem
<dtrott>	gogasan: I would recommend you ask this group for a recommendation for a cutting edge distro that is likely to already have everything compliled in, at least then you know what might work before spending a bunch of time compiling kernel modules.
<gogasan>	Do You mean that Ubuntu isn't cutting edge distro? Should i check something like OpenSuse? On my PC I use Linux Mint, and didn't had any experience with other distros.
<dtrott>	I am unable to answer that question, my preferred disto is Centos (which is not cutting edge), hence why I asked for others to give a recommendation.

<MagneticDuck>	I have a project I cloned from a git repo, and then modified in small ways
<MagneticDuck>	what's the easiest way I have to make a process that converts the original repo into the modified one?
<MagneticDuck>	I was hoping diff -e would do the trick
<MagneticDuck>	but it just gives me ed scripts for each file that differs
<MagneticDuck>	how about a script that does everything?
<dtrott>	MagneticDuck: you probably want to ask the question on #git however the answer is likely to be be git diff with some options.
<iflema>	MagneticDuck: clone/fork and branch
<dtrott>	That said what you should probably do is fork the repository on github then add the clone as a remote and simply push your changes to your fork.
<dtrott>	Then you can simply as the original owner to take your change as a patch on github
<dtrott>	s/as/ask
<iflema>	pull request
<MagneticDuck>	yeah okay

<ocZio>	Hi, is it possible for a SSH server to issue a KEY to a client so the client can login seamlessly without entering the password?
<dtrott>	remind me never to lend you any hardware
<DeLilleD>	I got a question about redirecting input and output to netcat
<SpiceMan>	ocZio: no.
<dtrott>	ocZio: man ssh-keygen
<ocZio>	SpiceMan, ok
<SpiceMan>	ocZio: the key must be pre-generated
<dtrott>	ssh-keygen -t rsa
<ocZio>	SpiceMan, I understand the concept of public key for the client, then adding them to the server's authorized_keys
<dtrott>	is probably what your looking for
<ocZio>	but I would like to basically issue the key from the server to the client, rather than the other way around if that makes sense
<dtrott>	it doesn't
<dtrott>	you should never trust the server
<ocZio>	if this is not possible, what are the common ways to do something like this? or allow a temporary access for a client to login...
<ocZio>	dtrott, ok, I just want to give a temporary access.
<ocZio>	basically I want the client to connect to a SSH server when needed (call me maybe)
<SpiceMan>	ocZio: amazon has an ssh-keygen web interface, basically.
<dtrott>	SpiceMan: I believe you can upload your own public key if you don’t trust them though
<ocZio>	SpiceMan, it's still the same tho, the CLIENT generates the key rather than the SERVER granting access because of X key
<ocZio>	what I want to do is the other way around :-)
<dtrott>	ocZio: What is the attack vector your trying to protect against /
<dtrott>	?
<ocZio>	Server=>send valid key to client=> client connects to server.
<SpiceMan>	what triggers the whole process?
<limbo>	ocZio: just allow logins without any sort of security then.
<limbo>	no need for keys
<ocZio>	dtrott, I am not really trying to protect anything, some of the clients are behind firewall hence not accessible
<limbo>	sounds like thats your goal
<ocZio>	I wan't them to connect to the server through reverse SSH
<ocZio>	so, I(server) provide a temp key for the client, the client uses that and connects to the server with the given port etc...
<ocZio>	limbo, ?
<limbo>	ocZio: how does the server know to trust the client?
<SpiceMan>	what triggers the whole process?
<ocZio>	limbo, it will be one off and on request. Obviously you will say that if someone get's that key they will be able to pretend etc...
<DeLilleD>	why don't you want clients to generate their keys?
<limbo>	ocZio: nope
<ocZio>	I don't mind that, it will be restricted access anyway and all I need is to login and monitor stuff in that client
<limbo>	ocZio: I'll say that if the server gives the key to the client, the client don't need to "get the key"
<limbo>	they will have it handed to them.
<limbo>	and it's totally pointless
<limbo>	you could just let them in without a key
<dtrott>	ocZio: You probably just want to find a VPN solution.
<ocZio>	limbo, why it is pointless? it's a key generated for a session. once the session is over, the key is removed from the server
<limbo>	hey, I am super anonymous and I wanna connect to you! Ok, here is the key!
<ocZio>	limbo, first of all it's the other way around, the server sends the key, the client cannot request.
<revere>	Hello I'm in limbo
<limbo>	ocZio: how does the server know where to send the key?
<revere>	according to google maps I'm in the stomach
<SpiceMan>	what triggers the whole process?
<SpiceMan>	wait, I don't care anymore
<limbo>	SpiceMan: agreed
<ocZio>	limbo, I have messaging (rabbitmq) setup with different users, different ips for each device (client)
<limbo>	ocZio: it is possible. learn to do it.
<ocZio>	I am sending to the correct machine. whoever has the access to that queue, will get the message.
<limbo>	you can run openssl keygen on a server as well as a client
<limbo>	and the results are just files
<limbo>	put them where they should be, and then remove them when they are no longer valid
<ocZio>	SpiceMan, why so cocky?
<ocZio>	limbo, will have a look, thanks
<DeLilleD>	I got a question about redirecting input and output to netcat
<limbo>	ocZio: it's hard to help people when you have no clue what they actually want to do.
<ocZio>	libmo I got that, I answered all of your questions and explained as much as I could.
<ocZio>	no need to be cocky.
<limbo>	ocZio: he's not cocky, he just gave up on putting effort into helping you because you did not put effort into helping him understand your needs.
<SpiceMan>	I asked three times, got no answer
<ocZio>	SpiceMan, ? which question you didn't get answer to ?
<dtrott>	SpiceMan: what triggers the whole process?
<ocZio>	<ocZio> limbo, I have messaging (rabbitmq) setup with different users, different ips for each device (client)
<ocZio>	<ocZio> I am sending to the correct machine. whoever has the access to that queue, will get the message. 
<limbo>	ocZio: I had to do a lot of dancing around to reach that :)
<ocZio>	dtrott, next?
<limbo>	ocZio: my goal from my first question was to get an answer to that question as well
<limbo>	just that I was more patient.
<dtrott>	So your are running the rabbitMQ server on your network ?
<ocZio>	yes.
<ocZio>	my devices (clients) are changing ips/hosts all the time
<ocZio>	and are not available directly (behind a firewall)
<ocZio>	in order to access them, I will need to tell them to connect to me, rather than me accessing them
<ocZio>	that's the whole goal.
<dtrott>	Sure, but most VPN’s can handle one side being dynamic
<dtrott>	Just setup a tunnel behind the firewalls between you and the clients
<ocZio>	I cannot use a vpn, the devices are on different networks/isps etc... and they always change ips as I said
<dtrott>	That or enable TLS on rabbitMQ and open it to the work (not recommended)
<dtrott>	s/work/world
<dtrott>	As I said as long as your IP is static won’t be a problem
<dtrott>	Hell I have setup VPN’s where both sides are dynamic with dynamic dns
<ocZio>	interesting :-)
<DeLilleD>	I got a question about redirecting input and output to netcat
<peetaur2>	DeLilleD: if you want it answered, you should ask it. :)
<dtrott>	peetaur2: But what if s/hes not sure if s/he will like the answer?
<DeLilleD>	How do I set up a netcat so that all input is passed to a certain binary and that the output from that binary is passed back to netcat?
<dtrott>	mkfifo is probably your friend
<DeLilleD>	ok, then how do I set up netcat and the binary to use this named pipe?
<dtrott>	binary < fifo | nc > fifo
<DeLilleD>	thanks, I'll try that
<dtrott>	Hmm should it be possible to load a stripped kernel module
<colo-work>	sure; if the version magic is OK.
<dtrott>	Works fine as long as I don’t strip it
<dtrott>	Hmm may be I need to pass —strip-debug argument to strip
<leeyaa>	hello

<leeyaa>	thats if i want remote locking
<duncannz>	is there an open source license that prevents monetization of forks?
<dtrott>	Depending on your definition of monetization GPL
<duncannz>	dtrott: specifically, it is an ad supported android app and I want to publish the source code but prevent others from changing the advertising ID and making money off it
<peetaur2>	duncannz: as long as your patches, linked code, etc. is all GPL and source available, you can monetize http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html
<duncannz>	peetaur2: I don't want that though, I don't want to allow others to fork my code and monetize it
<peetaur2>	and there are likely lots of non-free open source licenses out there
<dtrott>	duncannz: I would ask you to consider your motives behind open sourcing it then
<peetaur2>	atlassian confluence for example is open source and non-free
<peetaur2>	and also IntelliJ IDEA is open source non-free
<dtrott>	duncannz: Your best bet is probalby not to open source the whole code base then
<peetaur2>	open source is a HUGE positive step from proprietary garbage. Don't let money stop you from open sourcing it
<duncannz>	basically I want the source code to be scrutinizable and I want others to be able to submit patches. They should also be able to fork it, just not change the advertising ID to their own and make money off it
<leeyaa>	nvm i figured it. seems i needed to allow 127.0.0.1 which is kinda weird
<dtrott>	duncannz: The short answer to your question is there is no value to open sourcing it with the model you are proposing.
<peetaur2>	duncannz: maybe you can just add a term that says if you go out of business, it is converted to GPL so they can fork, but not before; I kinda don't think you'll find ability to fork and inability to change the advertizing in any existing license.
<duncannz>	I basically want Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 but for code
<peetaur2>	once they can fork it, they can easily change that advertising ID
<duncannz>	yes but I want them to not be allowed to
<dtrott>	duncannz: Anything is possible hire a lawyer and they will draft you an agreement that will do exactly what you want, but there are two problems:
<dtrott>	1. A license is worthless unless you have the money to enforce it.
<dtrott>	2. Why would anyone bother to even look at the code if they can’t do anything with it.
<autrilla>	15IOPS for a DB is veeery bad, right?
<autrilla>	peetaur2, IDEA is open source?
<autrilla>	I didn't know that
<peetaur2>	2. to scrutinize, and possibly (reluctantly) submit changes (that they lose the copyright to... not a free project).  But this is a HUGE benefit over completely proprietary garbage
<dtrott>	autrilla: IDEA community is
<duncannz>	dtrott: 1. It would give me a leg to stand on if someone submits a monetized fork to the play store, no money involved. 2. Scrutinize, and yeah what peetaur2 said
<dtrott>	Ultimate still has some proprietry code
<peetaur2>	I thought the full one has source but also a non-free license
<autrilla>	dtrott, ah, well. I don't really care, imho is the best Java IDE
<RahulAN>	hIi all
<duncannz>	it's an app I made myself it's not for a business, I'm not about to hire a lawyer for it. But I want to be able to appeal a forked app with the advertising id changed if one gets submitted to the play store.

<lonston_>	Hi everyone, how can i remove the epel repository caches ? I have already removed the repository pacakge epel-repo.rpm then i have cleared the caches in /var/cache/yum/x86_64/6Server and /var/cache/epel i have tried # yum clean metadata , # yum clean all. but still epel respository fetching when ever we install some pacakges. Tried disabling repository that too failed.
<autrilla>	I'm not sure. I wouldn't worry about anyone copying my app. I'm against intellectual property.
<whonow>	never knew that fact either, thanks for the advice peetaur2 ! :)
<autrilla>	I don't think ideas can be owned
<dtrott>	autrilla: whats your opion on novels (books) ?
<autrilla>	Instead, just take advantage that it takes the copier time, so you have a head start :)
<autrilla>	dtrott, the same
<dtrott>	so your opinon is that as soon as its written a book can be freely copied by anyone ?
<autrilla>	yes
<peetaur2>	I agree that anything you can simply copy should not be protected in some artificial way... if a copy costs 5 cents, that's what it should cost; but not sure how I'd implement it in a real market ;)
<RahulAN>	what could be the problem here? i did ssh root@<ip>
<peetaur2>	(at least evil publishing monopolies would die, even if novelists couldn't make as much money with such freedom)
<autrilla>	peetaur2, I basically don't think ip is property because if you have an idea for a book and I use it, I'm not preventing you from using your idea, whereas if you had a machine and I used it, I would be preventing you from using your machine
<dtrott>	autrilla: I agree with your point on idea’s but copyright is a different concept to “patents (ideas)”
<peetaur2>	my view is compatible with that... if I could copy your machine without trespassing or interfering with your use of it, then why can't anyone do the same at such a low cost? that is the natural cost; an artificial one is just a monopoly
<autrilla>	It's exactly the same. A book is just a long string. Numbers.
<autrilla>	peetaur2, yeah, why can't they? Cheaper books, everyone is happy
<autrilla>	Patents are the best monopoly creators
<dtrott>	Just to take that point to its logical conclusion if I have a ticket to a concept and you somehow manage to copy it should you get into the concert for free (also should I see on your lap when I find you in my seat) ?
<dtrott>	concert
<peetaur2>	patents are even more evil than monopoly... if you want to succeed and DON'T use patents, than people can likely sue you for your own ideas, since you can't coutersue their ideas you already patented
<peetaur2>	so it's like an infectious monopoly
<peetaur2>	but I think there's some sort of open patent system somewhere that you can send your patents to where their mission is to just counter sue for you and let you use anything they have as a patent (or did I imagine that)
<autrilla>	dtrott, it's the concert's orginizer's responsibility to avoid counterfeiting
<peetaur2>	(if such a system collected enough patents, nobody else could ever use their patents against anyone)
<autrilla>	peetaur2, I think it's what Tesla did
<autrilla>	Elon Musk's Tesla that is, not Nikola
<dtrott>	autrilla: But there is no such thing a counterfeit all copies are legitimate
<autrilla>	dtrott, are all copies of dollar bills legitimate?
<peetaur2>	not unless they can be redeemed for the same amount of gold any year in the future :P
<dtrott>	Sure if there is no such thing as interlectual property if you can buy the paper and ink then thats fine.
<annihilannic>	Have you patented that spelling of interlectual?
<autrilla>	What gives something legitimacy is the acceptance by third parties
<dtrott>	annihilannic: Public domain, anyone  can use it
<autrilla>	The concert ticket is worthless if the people at admissions don't accept it
<annihilannic>	dtrott: Thanks, I already did ;-)
<whonow>	ah peetaur2, i seem to have forgotten, the other way is to create .my.cnf in home directory for user in this case root, with [client] and details <- this was actually the preferred way i was looking for but thanks anyway
<whonow>	cheers!
<autrilla>	annihilannic, you'll have news from my lawyers
<annihilannic>	autrilla: Ah, so YOU patented it.  You sneaky Musk.
<DeLilleD>	Why can't I connect to my netcat listener if I redirect the output to a named pipe (redirecting output to a file works fine)? I get "Connection refused".
<peetaur2>	DeLilleD: is it still running? also check lsof -Pni | grep LISTEN
<dtrott>	DeLilleD: Its problably the order of opening the handles it may be deadlocked trying to open both in handles before the output handles
<DeLilleD>	yes, nc is still running in my other terminal
<autrilla>	Huh, weird, a third party is getting connections closed during handshake with my http server
<peetaur2>	autrilla: maybe your handshake is patented so they had to use a 3rd party one that is not entirely compatible
<hay207>	how to add mingw to codeblocks?
<autrilla_>	It's so useful when they give you such detail. Yes, closed during handshake, but why? At what point?

<leeyaa>	MrElendig: can it be done via the regex? i have similar one working OK - find /dir/ -name '????-??-?[!0]_*mysql.tar.gz' -type f
<MrElendig>	-name is not regex
<madprops>	this is a track i made using rms samples https://soundcloud.com/mad_props/b0ss
<MrElendig>	use -regex for that
<MrElendig>	but really, using -! is cleaner

<Lope>	I can't think of one good reason, besides wagging it at a Mac user and saying "neh neneneneh you wasted your money"
<peetaur2>	Lope: same reason people run wintendows
<baldfat>	Lope: Because one can and also people feel the need since most developers develope on OS X at every freaking Linux anything I got to over the last 5 years. Sry
<baldfat>	<---- Hates OS X and anything Apple and it pisses me off that so many "Linux" people still use that case insensitive crapware
<EdwardIII>	hrm can i just pipe a transcript into netcat? e.g. nc smtp.host.com 25 < /tmp/example-smtp-transcript.txt? even though it's interactive?
<EdwardIII>	doesn't seem to be working here
<rascul>	EdwardIII use expect
<EdwardIII>	rascul: ah, thanks
<EdwardIII>	there's this great tool swaks but it doesn't seem to have a way to force non-tls smtp to see what happens
<EdwardIII>	e.g. if you wanna check your server is definitely not allowing non-tls mail
<triceratux>	Lope: what gets me is folks running GNU/Linux on macs. why would you pay a premium for highend hardware & then run an os that isnt designed for it rofl ?
<Lope>	yeah when I see a developer using OSX I just lose 50% of my respect for them instantly.
<EdwardIII>	triceratux: because it's it's decent hardware
<EdwardIII>	linus uses a macbook air, no?
<Lope>	EdwardIII: for Linus the cost of the hardware is not important
<rascul>	EdwardIII used to
<rascul>	he didn't like the screen and is now using a sony vaio something or other
<EdwardIII>	if you're a serious professional you should be willing to invest a decent amount of money in your tools, shouldn't you?

<EdwardIII>	rascul: me neither
<rascul>	or os, just use what you want
<EdwardIII>	it's all about using whatever works for you imo
<peetaur2>	heh, everything matters; just it's silly if someone chooses a specific thing for a silly reason

<diverdude>	hi, if i do this: find /mnt/filestore/PDO -iname "*.hdf" -exec h5ls {} + it prints a few lines for each file. How do i print the filename also together with the few lines being printed per file?
<EdwardIII>	hrm can i make expect just go "expect *"?
<EdwardIII>	i don't really care what the response is, just that one occured
<Notwang>	hi
<Notwang>	why can't I add one interface to many bridges?
<peetaur2>	diverdude: -exec echo -e "-------\n" {} "-------\n" -exec h5ls...
<JustSighDudes>	Why the hell are LXC is shittily documented
<JustSighDudes>	Wow that was terrible grammar. I would show myself out if I wasn't so angry
<peetaur2>	JustSighDudes: maybe because it's not done... it is done when it is feature compatible with openvz
<kurahaupo_>	Notwang: a bridge performs a function akin to a network segment; you can't connect an interface to multiple network segments either
<rascul>	EdwardIII i seem to recall you can use * in such a manner
<JustSighDudes>	peetaur2: So openvz is the recommended container tech?
<rascul>	eww openvz
<diverdude>	peetaur2:  find /mnt/filestore/KDO -iname "*.hdf" -exec echo -e "------\n" {} "------\n" h5ls {} +     it says find: Only one instance of {} is supported with -exec ... +
<JustSighDudes>	rascul: My reaction as well
<rascul>	JustSighDudes see docker
<rascul>	peetaur2 what makes you think that openvz is lxc's goal?
<EdwardIII>	hrm when i try and run expect it just spits out my spawn line then nothing heh
<EdwardIII>	trying to do na smtp session
<JustSighDudes>	rascul: I'm having problems wrapping my head around how to update in case of security patches. Figured I'd go with something I know
<rascul>	JustSighDudes docker uses lxc
<rascul>	https://docs.docker.com/faq/#what-does-docker-add-to-just-plain-lxc
<JustSighDudes>	rascul: Yeah but the single application paradigm is weird to me
<EdwardIII>	damnit expect just DWIM
<peetaur2>	JustSighDudes: if you want security, don't use docker :D and if you want better security probably openvz, yes. But openvz is only in kernel 2.6.x, and lxc is supposed to be the 3.x openvz.
<rascul>	if you want security, don't use containers
*	rascul points to qemu
<peetaur2>	diverdude: I was missing a \;          -exec echo -e "-------\n" {} "\n-------\n" \; -exec h5ls... \;
<peetaur2>	rascul: their website says so... it explains how openvz (which is not mainline) is being ported to mainline 3.x and now called LXC in mainline
<peetaur2>	rascul: and docker *can* use lxc, but the default is their hackish insecure 'libcontainer' or something like that, since a while ago
<EdwardIII>	it just spits out the first line (nc...) then exits: https://gist.github.com/EdwardIII/7c088052593726a766b6
<rascul>	peetaur2 yeah, i meant docker can, not does
<peetaur2>	rascul: libcontainer runs all as root, no mapping of uid0 to a non-privileged user, etc.
<rascul>	also, i'm finding no reference to openvz in the way you mentioned on linuxcontainers.org
<rascul>	jsut some mailiing list discussion where they discussed it 5 years ago
<diverdude>	peetaur2: thanks
<peetaur2>	rascul: first link I found already has mentions "and since then we keep working on merging OpenVZ bits and pieces to the upstream kernel. It took way longer than expected, we are still in the middle of the process"  http://openvz.livejournal.com/45647.html
<peetaur2>	(but I dunno whose website that is)
<rascul>	i don't see how that leads to lxc being complete when it's feature compatible with openvz
<peetaur2>	"merging OpenVZ bits" ... why else would they merge it if not to get the features?
<peetaur2>	so it's the goal, but whether or not you consider it ready to use is subjective and your decision
<peetaur2>	I could have also just said "it's new" to explain lacking docs, but it is still being developed too
<rascul>	it's not the goal though to be feature compatible with openvz, and never was
<rascul>	that's why i'm so confused at you claiming such
<peetaur2>	if it's not then they're silly; how could anyone switch then?
<peetaur2>	and it doesn't need "all" features... just whatever is commonly used, etc.
<rascul>	not requiring third party kernel patches is a good reason for people to switch
<rascul>	for one
<peetaur2>	and I don't know their more specific goals, just what you can derive from things like that page I linked
<peetaur2>	I have never used openvz and don't plan on it... containers are more work ... hardware is cheap so just buy RAM :P   but I have used lxc so I can compile kernels for other distros on my machine :D so yeah, that's a bonus for sure
<Psi-Jack>	Hmmm. Interesting subject here.
<rascul>	i have used lxc and openvz in the past
<peetaur2>	yes arguing about semantics and opinions of things not clearly specified by the authorities is interesting... </sarcasm>
<Psi-Jack>	I have used OpenVZ, and don't ever want to again. I have also used LXC and in fact still do. :)
<rascul>	i don't really care at all about containers anymore
<peetaur2>	Psi-Jack: hehe; what makes LXC better for you?
<Psi-Jack>	I use docker with it's libcontainer as well... But, only for testing chef stuff.
<Psi-Jack>	Hmm.. It's got a more functional vNIC stack without the dirty hacks that OpenVZ has, for starters.
<rascul>	the way of the future is immutable unikernels running in virtual machines imo
<rascul>	which i'm doing to some extent right now
<Psi-Jack>	They have better and more useful tools to roll out new lxc containers with very little difficulty.
<peetaur2>	I'd say the same, but I never used openvz ;) so I'll just say the tools seem friendly and good enough (just some quirks like lxc-attach not setting environment properly, and some versions would make lxc-start go in the foreground which just seems useless)
<peetaur2>	and one version of lxc would make debian 8 hang if you started an sshd inside it :)
<Psi-Jack>	Well, openvz, there were no tools, just manual labor to build your own, THEN make modifications so it would actually work as a container specifically. Dirty hacks.
<Psi-Jack>	You'd either roll your own, or find luck in trying to find a pre-made tarball you could unroll into place. Updating the distro inside? Good luck! Easily broken.
<rascul>	working with openvz was not fun
<Psi-Jack>	Heh yeah, exactly.
<Psi-Jack>	LXC is definitely a far cry easier.
<Psi-Jack>	I should check out kitchen-lxc, to see if it solves some of my docker-related issues. hehe
<Psi-Jack>	Mainly I had one issue with docker trying to get acpid to be installed and running, because of the limited read-only /proc/acpi/event provided by docker. heh
<goldstar>	is it safe to give the user under whcih the webserver runs a shell ? currently have to set up some webdirs using another user who then news sudo chown perms with the * glob which is an issue in and of itself
<peetaur2>	so it sounds good that I never tried to use openvz then :D
<awkwardtechdude>	I started a small irc server for whoever wants to join.
<peetaur2>	goldstar: whether it is safe depends on the user ;)  but it is less safe than something else, like setting their shell to some text ui / TUI script with some limited abilities
<JustSighDudes>	Psi-Jack: What tools do you use with LXC?
<peetaur2>	goldstar: basically the rule is that if they can enter input other than just choosing which prewritten command to run (no args), then it's less safe
<Psi-Jack>	JustSighDudes: The actual lxc-utils, which have scripts to easily build various distros, like CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu, heck, even Arch.
<Psi-Jack>	lxc-create :)
<Psi-Jack>	Even supports LVM, ZFS, and rootfs (directory)
<rascul>	goldstar the web server shouldn't be running shells for users
<rascul>	if you have to chown stuff to get the web server to serve it, sounds like you have a bad design
<goldstar>	peetaur2: thanks
<goldstar>	rascul: maybe I can explain my current layout and you can give me feeback on it
<rascul>	that could be beneficial
<rascul>	generally the web server (and the user which runs the web server) should do nothing more than serve static files and pass requests to apps running as different users
<goldstar>	rascul: so the webserver runs under user apache; I have a jenkins user that ssh's into the server to create new webdirs, delete webdirs etc (this is a dev enviro). The obvious issue is ownership of files which needs to be changed to apache. The problem is the webdir names are very dynamic so I've written a script which takes 4 params and  needs to run as root so in sudoers.d did something...
<goldstar>	...like "NOPASSWD /bin/sh file.sh *" which I dont feel very comfortable doing hence the question
<rascul>	why does apache need to own the files?
<rascul>	is it a static site or dynamic?
<goldstar>	rascul: dynamic
<Psi-Jack>	Hmmm
<limbo>	goldstar: you could also have a crontab run by root (or FAM/gamin/inotify on the dir/files) that fixes permissions
<rascul>	i'm not familiar with jenkins, and this might sound like a special case
<limbo>	goldstar: w/o actually being run by unprivileged users
<Psi-Jack>	Sounds like jenkins for deploying code.
<leeyaa>	i have replaced an old script and i need to remove it. however i want to replace the content of old script with something that will tell me if anyone tries to use it and email me. is it possible to tell via bash what process is trying to execute the script? for example is it possible to get name of process that is trying to run bash /root/scripts/test.sh (from inside test.sh) ?
<goldstar>	limbo: thats a good idea, didnt think of that
<BluesKaj>	Howdy folks
<rascul>	leeyaa look up the parent pid
<goldstar>	Psi-Jack: we do use jenkins to deploy code via ansible but this case is related to build webdirs for git branches
<leeyaa>	rascul: ill need name, pid wont be enough as i will getting the reply via email
<leeyaa>	by the time i check email, parent will be different
<rascul>	leeyaa if you have the pid, you can get all the rest
<rascul>	ps, /proc/pid, etc
<Psi-Jack>	goldstar: So, the reason for jenkins to ssh to itself is what?
<goldstar>	thanks guys:)
<leeyaa>	rascul: oh so you mean before sending the email, get parent pid and all the rest ?
<rascul>	leeyaa yes, grab the parent pid and look up the info to put in the email
<goldstar>	Psi-Jack: jenkins is on a diff server
<Psi-Jack>	Gotcha.
<colo-work>	leeyaa, try    while read -r i x; do [[ $i = PPid: ]] && ps -fp "${x}" && break; done < /proc/$$/status
<leeyaa>	rascul: i get it, thanks a lot
<goldstar>	Psi-Jack: so i have to use remote shell
<Psi-Jack>	goldstar: I see. For developmental testing by use of a CI system, such as Jenkins, you're making jenkins ssh to the webserver user and pull git code to update it once it's done testing and passing the build?
<Osa2>	Hi all, I was looking today to create a inhouse cloud. Like owncloud or sealife. But I only use it to sync images pictures and foto's maybe you guys know of other great ways to accomplisch just that. Ubuntu with some samba share maybe and a client to view files stored from an android???
<Osa2>	the main access would be an android phone
<goldstar>	Psi-Jack: yes, and dynamacillay create webdirs for each branch and rm when its deleted from the repo
<goldstar>	dynamically*
<Osa2>	I don't like amazon cloud whic is not protected/encrypted so that is why I want to do it myself
<Psi-Jack>	goldstar: So. Why not make a special user like "deploy", or such, instead?
<Psi-Jack>	Osa2: SO, why not use owncloud? :P
<Osa2>	Because owncloud does not give me the ability to view the files 'on line'
<goldstar>	Psi-Jack: yeh, I could but the problem is still the same
<Osa2>	I need to download each image in order to view it.
<Psi-Jack>	Osa2: Excuse me?
<Osa2>	waste of space on my cell
<Psi-Jack>	Osa2: Use a WebDAV capable client then. Very simple. :p
<Osa2>	oh okay, didn't know about that
<Osa2>	webdav I'll google it
<Psi-Jack>	FX supports WebDAV, with the paid plugins.
<Osa2>	FX is a tool?

<Psi-Jack>	Pretty sure http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key knows and documents this.
<Psi-Jack>	Yep
<tuxcrafter>	Psi-Jack: that was not exactly what i need
<tuxcrafter>	i am in grub-rescue console
<tuxcrafter>	over serial console (screen)
<tuxcrafter>	and want to reboot the server
<Psi-Jack>	...
<Psi-Jack>	Then use a DRAC or iLO :p
<tuxcrafter>	nah i dont use that stuff
<Psi-Jack>	Or even last-ditch, IPMI v2
<Psi-Jack>	Then you're a fool.
<tuxcrafter>	a simple ctrl-alt-del would do the trick
<tuxcrafter>	but i dont know how to sent it over screen
<Psi-Jack>	YOu can't.
<WildPikachu>	Psi-Jack, read the channel rules please, you should know by now insults are not permitted
<Psi-Jack>	Okay, sorry, rephrasing: It's foolish not to be using remote administrative devices as such, for servers.
<WildPikachu>	there we go :)
<peetaur2>	I also love those IPMI things... great for bios or boot issues... but of course sysrq is better over ssh
<raboof>	I want to start an executable when it's uploaded. right now i use 'inotifywait' to detect it's being updated, but then I want to wait until it has finished uploading before starting it. That can be done by waiting until the file is no longer busy. what would be a good way to wait until the file is no longer busy?
<raboof>	also, right now i'm writing a sh script to do this. if there's an easier way I'd be interested, too :)
<Psi-Jack>	peetaur2: As a last ditch, IPMI v2 is decent, even IPMIv1 just to initiate a remote reboot at best.
<peetaur2>	raboof: easiest simple trick is just name it .tmp and client runs mv when it's done
<shadok>	raboof: a quick solution would be to upload the file and rename it when the transfer is done, mv is atomic
<shadok>	peetaur2: grmbl :p
<peetaur2>	can anyone tell me what advantage "virtual" accounts have over normal linux accounts, provided that you know how to configure pam and sshd, etc. to control access?
<colo-work>	peetaur2, "virtual" in what kind of context?
<peetaur2>	colo-work: http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/centos-redhat-vsftpd-ftp-with-virtual-users.html
<benoliver999>	I have a load of files in a directory. I want to append them all with an extension, ie 'file' becomes 'file.extension'. What's the easiest way to do this?
<colo-work>	peetaur2, catering to people who feel more familiar/safe with other auth backends than PAM (and therefore mostly shadow)
<peetaur2>	how can you be more familiar with a user db that has its best documentation on some random blog? :D
<colo-work>	benoliver999,      for i in ./*; do mv -i "${i}" "${i}".extension; done
<colo-work>	peetaur2, good question ;)
<colo-work>	I have no answer to it.
<benoliver999>	colo-work: I'm glad I asked...
<benoliver999>	Thanks!
<peetaur2>	and btw, you might think "-t hash" means you has the passwords, but nope.... it's plain text :D
<peetaur2>	s/has/hash/
<Iridos>	peetaur2, you don't want to give shell access to a machine to people who just blew their unencrypted password all over the net?
<sorinello>	Hello. Can someone tell me how can I find out what sets a specified environment variable ?
<Iridos>	peetaur2, the article you linked even says that
<peetaur2>	Iridos: I don't have to give shell access to people for them to use linux accounts for vsftpd
<Iridos>	that's the point exactly...
<colo-work>	peetaur2, so set those account's shell to something that doesn't work like a shell does? :)
<Iridos>	peetaur2, how do you disable the shell access then?
<fas3r>	hello
<peetaur2>	yeah like /bin/false and X11Forwarding no, PermitTunnel no, etc.
<fas3r>	is there a way to identify which ethernet card (ETH ) is corresponding to which PCI port with lspci ?
<fas3r>	( or other)
<Iridos>	peetaur2, "etc" :)
<peetaur2>	also add AllowTcpForwarding no, and ForceCommand ... if you feel like it
<rascul>	fas3r the first number of lspci output is the pci slot
<rascul>	see man page, it explains
<strigga>	Hello, I am trying to install OLA (open lighting Architecture). ./configure works fine. When I "make", I get the error: Makefile:16228: recipe for target 'common/protocol/OlaService.pb.h' failed - Google didn't return much and especially not about tha application. Any idea where to look`
<Iridos>	peetaur2, except if you want X11Forwarding for your normal non-ftp user
<peetaur2>	Iridos: here is something to read http://www.semicomplete.com/articles/ssh-security/
<peetaur2>	Iridos: no, just make a Match block and set special settings there for the ftp/sftp users
<Iridos>	peetaur2, you asked why virtual users... and that's why
<peetaur2>	but I said "provided that you know how to configure pam and sshd, etc. to control access"
<Iridos>	it's just cleaner to separate them off
<Iridos>	just assume there's another way your existing user with existing passwd can be exploited for something you didn't want to allow
<raboof>	it didn't seem easy to wait for the rename.. I settled for waiting for the 'close_write' event for now.
<autrilla>	How could I see if my database is slow?
<peetaur2>	autrilla: a simple algorithm can ball park it...
<peetaur2>	if server is mysql then slow else fast :)
<peetaur2>	or run some queries that take longer than a second and compare run times
<autrilla>	Heh, yeah. There's a (probably crappy) PHP script that takes 444000ms
<peetaur2>	(mysql is fast only with myisam engine which nobody uses these days, and innodb is the slowest (pseudo-)transactional database engine around)
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<autrilla>	most of that doing db queries
<Psi-Jack>	peetaur2: People still use myisam actually.
<strigga>	peetaur2: I don't know which year you live in, but since mySQL 5.x it's a lot faster that it used to be _ provided you know how to index :D
<peetaur2>	one time someone wrote a query that took like 15 min on mysql, and then they did a database dump, import to postgresql, similar query there, and that took like 1 minute including dump+restore
<peetaur2>	I saw it. I was there. It just couldn't be optimized well on mysql.
<peetaur2>	indexes aren't enough with multi table joins... and "show processlist" says things like "copying data to temporary table", which reveals the problem (they aren't filtering rows as they make them... they generate a huge every-table-permutation thing before filtering anything)
<longguang>	how to judge which process use too many memory?
<peetaur2>	longguang: use top, and sort by memory (shift+m)
<autrilla>	So every time you try and execute that script, it hammers the server for around 7 minutes
<autrilla>	php-fpm starts spawning children like crazy
<Psi-Jack>	autrilla: Heh, I can concur with peetaur2's analysis as I've seen it as well.
<peetaur2>	autrilla: spawning like crazy, or just those that are spawned hang around longer and accumulate?
<autrilla>	And surprisingly, considering it's a csv-formatted db dump, write iops jump to 600
<autrilla>	peetaur2, spawning like crazy. 5 per second or so
<peetaur2>	autrilla: but have you verified that when it's not hammered for 7 min, that these processes don't spawn and then just finish before you detect them?
<autrilla>	peetaur2, no, there's usually just 2 or 3 workers
<peetaur2>	(btw the automated mysql to postgres conversion ended up in the production release :))
<rascul>	postgres or bust
<Psi-Jack>	Arrrr!
<autrilla>	I use postgres for everything I write
<peetaur2>	same here... it is the clearly superior free database out there
<rascul>	well, if i need a big db thing, postgres is my answer
<peetaur2>	but sometimes you have to use mysql, like for wordpress :|
<blind>	I just use a load of text files
<Psi-Jack>	You don't ever /need/ wordpress. :p
<autrilla>	peetaur2, yeah, that's my case. Not postgress, but other stuff
<rascul>	wordpress is horrible
<peetaur2>	Psi-Jack: well I don't get to tell the customers what they need or don't need :D
<autrilla>	php is horrible
<Psi-Jack>	peetaur2: I will, actually! :p
*	peetaur2 is the IT guy not computer-to-human-relations
<momomo>	how can I change the hotkey for minimize window on ubuntu 14.04  ?
<Psi-Jack>	momomo: That's not distribution-specific. Ask better questions.
<peetaur2>	momomo: if it's unity it is distro specific; otherwise check the DE docs/channel or at least tell us which DE you use in case someone knows
<momomo>	I am on unity and using compiz
<peetaur2>	(on KDE that's easy... KDE has great keyboard shortcut stuff that they force every app to use)
<spreeuw>	momomo apt-get install xfce4
<autrilla>	Debugging other people's code sucks
<momomo>	spreeuw, you are joking right? :P
<peetaur2>	more like "taking a small chance" than "joking" really
<Psi-Jack>	momomo: A lot of people hate Unity and don't want to support it. :p
<momomo>	Psi-Jack, yes, I kind of hate it too
<Psi-Jack>	So, stop using it. :p
<peetaur2>	momomo: so why use it? you have many choices, even on Ubuntu.
<Psi-Jack>	Me, I don't support Unity, or Ubuntu, at all, period.
<momomo>	gnome 3 sucks
<momomo>	more
<spreeuw>	even on ubuntu you have a choice to format your drive
<Psi-Jack>	No, Ubuntu's breaking of gnome 3 sucks.
*	autrilla begs to differ
<autrilla>	spreeuw, and switch to something decent, yes
<peetaur2>	longguang: top has a 'batch' mode for that
<peetaur2>	longguang: for iostat, it's not as easy... but just tell it to run more than once, and parse it, or use /proc/$pid/stat to find the details (man procfs may have the info you need to decypher it)
<peetaur2>	first result in iostat is averages since some unkonwn time (usually bootup) and isn't very useful; so ignore first
<autrilla>	I don't see any longguang speaking
<peetaur2>	he PMmed me saying he wants the top 10 memory usage and some iotop info for processes
<autrilla>	ah lol
<peetaur2>	*iostat
<peetaur2>	but I guess iotop might work too if it has a batch mode like top does
<autrilla>	This is clearly a problem with the crappy script written in a crappy language
<HulkSmash>	i would like to know what knowledgeable geeks think about http://fifth-browser.sourceforge.net/, I an looking for a GPLv3 browser for linux.
<autrilla>	Isn't chromium free?
<bulletxt>	how can I check what files are written to disk in real time from cli ?
<aksr>	hi guys. can scalpel file carver tool recover vim blowfish2 encrypted files?
<HulkSmash>	autrilla: i will check
<jahmed>	http://pastebin.com/TXCvZiH2
<jahmed>	stat  works, ls fails
<jahmed>	any clue
<rascul>	Input/output error
<rascul>	jahmed is there anything in dmesg?
<longguang>	i have two questions. 1. ethernet has overruns,dropped packets.   2. page allocation failure, how to locate the reason?
<bls>	aksr: what do you mean by recover?
<aksr>	bls: my hdd is almost dead, i'm trying to recover a specific file
<peetaur2>	jahmed: is that the hadoop java nfs implementation by chance? it is buggy and has to be restarted often (full reboot on broken clients)
<aksr>	bls: i tried extundelete, testdisk
<aksr>	bls: it's a very important file to me
<peetaur2>	(not just shutdown -r now either... needs a hard reset when it's done shutting down)
<bls>	probably not then, backups backups backups
<rascul>	aksr submit a foia request to the nsa to recover your file
<Ulrar>	Is there any way at all to copy a file conserving it's "Changed" date when you do a stat on it ?
<peetaur2>	aksr: you should recover the encrypted version first (maybe with testdisk), then try your decryption stuff later
<Ulrar>	rsync -t and cp -a won't work, apparently
<aksr>	peetaur2: i know the password for it
<aksr>	peetaur2: that's not a problem
<bls>	if it lives on a bad portion of the trashed disk, there's not much else you can do if the tools you've tried don't work. time to hire a professional recovery service
<aksr>	we don't have something like that here bls
<peetaur2>	aksr: try cloning the whole partition/disk with gnu dd_rescue
<aksr>	peetaur2: i thought to try scalpel, but i'm not sure of its efficiency for encrypted files
<bls>	the encryption has nothing to do with it
<peetaur2>	first thing you want to do is whatever the minimum is to prevent the faulty disk from further damaging your data, before you test out new tools to decrypt, or whatever
<aksr>	bls: well, if i understood correctly, it uses header and footer of files to reconstruct them, not sure if that is possible if the file is encrypted bls
<vegetablesalad19>	Hello, what is this sintaxe in .htaccess file "SetEnvIf Origin "http(s)?://(www\.)?(x1.server.com|x2.server.com|x3.server.com|x4.server.com)$" AccessControlAllowOrigin=$0$1", is this regex ?
<aksr>	peetaur2: well, it's unmounted atm
<peetaur2>	aksr: either testdisk or gnu dd_rescue should be used on an unmounted filesystem
<peetaur2>	but just having it spinning around, with dust and shrapnel bouncing around knocking molecules out of alignment is not going to make the data last longer
<peetaur2>	and defective chips heating up and burning out further, going from high error rate to not working at all
<Pekoh>	hi, can someone please tell me if this is possible. I am logged into centos 6.6 via ssh (putty). I "vi" a file and find it is all coloured. For example, commented text is all blue and I think, gee thats handy but then I realise I am have not yet "jumped up as root" / "su -" When i "su -" and then "vi" same file, its just all white text now and hard to find the uncommented sections.
<aksr>	peetaur2: you're right, but i have to try to rescue the file
<peetaur2>	Pekoh: check aliases and ~/.vimrc
<Pekoh>	peetaur: checking now
<stupid-1>	some terminal show different high lite
<Pekoh>	peetaur: "-bash: /root/.vimrc: No such file or directory"
<Haris>	hello all
<rickest>	Pekoh: ':syntax on'. also, copy your .vimrc from your normal user's home directory
<Haris>	is there a way to check limit on sockets that can be created on linux ?
<Pekoh>	ahh, that sounds like it might be the solution, would make sense
<triceratux>	Pekoh: ideally have a script which sets a symlink in your root vimdir which points at your ordinary user vimdir
<Pekoh>	thanks!
<shadok>	Ulrar: touch
<Pekoh>	tricer: ok, sounds like a plan, will look into that. Sounds complicated though :) be back soon
<triceratux>	Pekoh: copying .vimrc is fine but the symlink would make changes to the user .vimrc always reflected in the /root/.vimrc
<shadok>	Haris: look for "somaxconn "
<Ulrar>	shadok: You mean replicate the dates with touch ? That'll take days
<Pekoh>	sorry i think i got lost there. but the symlink would make changes to the user ? or should that be would NOT make changes
*	thehiddenrain is now known as hiddenrain
<Pekoh>	ah i think i get u
<shadok>	Ulrar: your original question didn't say anything about the number of files and you can just use find if that's the problem
<Pekoh>	tricer: do you mean, if the user makes changes to the .vimrc. Those changes would be reflected in the roots interface, as it is using a symlink
<triceratux>	Pekoh: its just that if you change your user /.vimrc youll have to copy it to /root every time, whereas with a symlink itll be a done deal from now on.
<triceratux>	yep you got it
<peetaur2>	Ulrar: heh I looked up touch when you asked your original question... seems touch won't set the change time either. And neither will tar.  (both have atime and mtime, not change time)
<Ulrar>	shadok: find ? I see how I'd use that to set one date on all files, but not how I'd put each original date ? I guess I could script something that parses the output of stat on each file and re-set it
<shadok>	peetaur2: touch -m changes the modification time
<Pekoh>	tricer: yeah, i get you. thanks again
<Pekoh>	time to learn about scripting a symbolic link :P
<peetaur2>	shadok: yeah as I said, both tar and touch can change modification or access time, but what changes the "change time"?
<shadok>	Ulrar: If you said something about the need to get the original time I wasn't here to see it, but you sure could script something with find to get and set the times back
<shadok>	peetaur2: you're right, good question and i can't test right now but some FS "merge ctime and mtime" iirc
<e271828182845904>	when is 1TB or more, of RAM, useful?
<Dominian>	Virtual Host
<Ulrar>	Thanks for the info, I'll test all that out
<peetaur2>	e271828182845904: databases that need max transaction performance, or VM hosts (but probably you should have more smaller nodes rather than a few mega ones)
<e271828182845904>	so those supermicro boards are mostly for vps then?
<shadok>	peetaur2: Ulrar but i'm pretty sure touch coul do it, it's strange i can't see that in the man
<e271828182845904>	i would doubt that would be the main purpose of those massive boards
<Ulrar>	I was surprised rsync didn't
<Ulrar>	I was sure all our backups had those infos
<triceratux>	Pekoh: btw i only script it because i run a live distro & the symlink disappears with the boot. on a sane distro just set it & forget it :)
<peetaur2>	hy do you even care about change time?
<e271828182845904>	peetaur2: you mean like financial databases and such?
<jahmed>	rascul: yes it said disk issues
<jahmed>	i am just wondering where did it get the stat info from then?
<peetaur2>	e271828182845904: like stock exchanges or things with rapid transactions
<e271828182845904>	right
<karlpinc>	Why does the man page for hdparm -J recommend a 30 second idle timeout for autopark on WD Green drives?  Why 30?
<e271828182845904>	those work in memory only?
<peetaur2>	e271828182845904: they make a cluster of highly redundant RAM-only database storage, and then it is as fast as can be
<e271828182845904>	nice, I wanna build that
<e271828182845904>	peetaur2: are those databases written in c or other lowlevel languages then?
<e271828182845904>	or do they run in virtual machines?
<shadok>	Ulrar: try using "touch -r sourcefile destfile" to check if it copies the ctime between files
<e271828182845904>	running them in assembly might be a pain, but should be fastest way to do it
<pngl>	Hi! I'm looking for a text replacement tool that reads input from a grammar file. For instance, [[...]] --tool--> ⟦...⟧
*	pngl is now known as papy
<peetaur2>	e271828182845904: people aren't smart enough to choose the best tech... they just make simple choices. Many use oracle which since like 2000 has not been the fastest at all.
<e271828182845904>	peetaur2: oracle db?
<peetaur2>	and assembly is not a good choice for an entire software project... the cost in maintenance would be higher than the gain in performance
<e271828182845904>	yeah, maybe true
<e271828182845904>	i was just refeering to transfer in memory speed
<Ulrar>	shadok: Looks like it's copying the modify time, not the change time
<karlpinc>	pngl: Have you considered m4?
<shadok>	Ulrar: what flesystem are you on?
<e271828182845904>	since other languages would have to use virtual memory
<e271828182845904>	peetaur2: so they build clusters of.. how much ram? 100TB?
<peetaur2>	e271828182845904: their main goal is the transaction performance... if their DB is 500 GB, then maybe only a tiny bit, but I imagine some are very large
<karlpinc>	papy: Or just use sed.  Or pregx in python or even perl.
<e271828182845904>	ok so when db grows, so does requirement for more ram then.
<e271828182845904>	or faster storage if possible
<shadok>	e271828182845904: hybrid system using RAM as buffer and SSD arrays as the storage exists too and the performances are insane (as the cost)
<peetaur2>	if the software was smart enough, the RAM+SSD makes the most sense... no reason to have old data sitting in memory unused
<e271828182845904>	shadok: i would like to try to build one of those myself, im on gentoo hardened, so learning a bit of everything
<peetaur2>	but like I said, people like simple answers.... "use ram" is better than "store on ssd, but use ram when the cache statistics blah blah...."
<e271828182845904>	shadok: got a 120G ssd, intel 510. and could always buy more ram
<Ulrar>	shadok: ext4 on my test, ext3 in production
<Ulrar>	Guess I should try on the ext3
<e271828182845904>	a system that loads directly into ram should be extremely fast
<peetaur2>	Ulrar: you run things in production that you have not tested? :P
<Ulrar>	peetaur2: It's not my, it's the client :(
<e271828182845904>	imagine the awesomeness of your whole / being in ram
<stupid-1>	ram is c0000L
<skfax>	Are there disadvantages to using a large number of context lines when creating a patch using the diff tool? (Other than the patch file having a greater size)
<shadok>	e271828182845904: i was more thinking about ibm flashsystems or the like, for you own use it's the kernel's job to balance ram and ssd accesses (at least if you app doesn't force it to fsync all the time)
<Ulrar>	peetaur2: We're trying to debug it .. it's horrible
<papy>	karlpinc: i'd like to have at least the power of a CFG
<peetaur2>	skfax: maybe if your base is not the same as the destination code and the context lines are different it'll be confused? dunno
<nbt>	hi, does anyone know what this means? (seen while mv'ing a directory from one partition to another)
<shadok>	Ulrar: i know there is some differences between the two
<nbt>	mv: setting attribute ‘security.capability’ for ‘security.capability’: Operation not permitted
<e271828182845904>	shadok: yes, i've gotten used to handling the grsec, pax and limits, its a bit of a mess
<shadok>	e271828182845904: you can do that easily if you want it
<shadok>	e271828182845904: err, not your whole / but /usr, /lib and stuff like that
<e271828182845904>	would be nice to have it move into ram, as in copy into ram and then live there until turn-off
<e271828182845904>	so turning off system would be a "move to ssd" action
<shadok>	e271828182845904: the problem is you'd lose any changes to the files
<peetaur2>	nbt: maybe a selinux thing? (which is called security context, not 'capability'). Or is it an extended attribute which can have a custom name (getfattr ...)
<shadok>	that's harder to do I suppose but if you just want to try with /usr/lib for example you can "cat" the files to /dev/null, that will put the files in cache
<peetaur2>	e271828182845904: your machine already does that... anything read stays in RAM until cache is full :P  The advantage of the full ram systems is transaction performance... the commit and be sure it's stored safely before continuing
<peetaur2>	e271828182845904: so it's about writing
<Fenikkusu>	Does anyone have any expirence with running a NAS on the GuruPlug?
<peetaur2>	Fenikkusu: ask a real question; that is a meta-question
<Fenikkusu>	peetaur2, I fail to see it as being a fake question. I have a guruplug, I am debating on if I should turn it into a NAS or just buy a pi and use that instead. My decision is to be based off the experiences of others building a NAS on a GuruPlug.
<ivali>	"should I turn it into a NAS or just buy a pi and use that instead?"
<ivali>	there
<jhodrien>	When someone says "Yes" where does that get you?
<Fenikkusu>	jhodrien, typical human interaction dectates that a person wouldn't just say 'yes' and be done with it. At the very least, it's a conversation starter, which is what I am after.
<ayecee>	Fenikkusu: look at the kind of conversation it's gotten you so far.
<jhodrien>	But it's inefficient.  You've just wasted a question, since either you get no answer, yes, or no.  You could have just posed the question.
<jhodrien>	You'd have probably got a response along the lines that that GuruPlug looks better on paper as a NAS device to start with, so why are you so keen to move to a Pi?
<peetaur2>	Fenikkusu: we're not trying to be mean, just it doesn't work on IRC to poll or ask "can anyone predict whether they know the answer to my next question?" sort of questions.
<Dr-007>	when i type 'ip route' i'll get my routings for eth0/eth1/etc...: default via 192.168.37.2 dev eth0
<BluesKaj>	heh, how can anyone predict what your next question will be, peetaur2?
<Dr-007>	only ifconfig shows this for eth0: inet addr:192.168.37.129  Bcast:192.168.37.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
<Dr-007>	so where is 192.168.37.2 coming from?
<Fenikkusu>	peetaur2, the difference is I'm looking to learn the actual experiences someone has had and am geniunely interested in said experiences. While it is true I ask as the result of my overall decision making process, I'm not blindly asking 'Should I do A or B?', but instead looking to get general overview of people's experiences there in. No offense, but if one of the IRC people decided to truely
<Fenikkusu>	be a dick to others, then they could start offering advice that is completly invalid, but the people asking are too ignorant to know the difference. So yes, I could ask 'Should I turn my GuruPlug into a NAS or buy a Pi instead?', but that tells me the general answer, not the underlying reasons behind the answer, which is more valuable to me than 'Just buy a Pi' or 'The GuruPlug works Well'
<peetaur2>	BluesKaj: you know that a meta question is just the same question though, differently worded... right?
<blind>	how about. "Should I turn my GuruPlug into a NAS or buy a Pi instead? Why?"
<Fenikkusu>	jhodrien, simply becasuse I worry of the NRAM on the Plug going out in addition to the point that the pi has 1GB of memory where as the Plug has 512MB
<BluesKaj>	peetaur2, well meta can mean mostly anything
<toothe>	when I send a multipart email, it won't show up as having an attachment. I noticed that when I send a Signed email it sends as an attachment. Is there a way to have it be the equivalent of a multi-part attachment? It can be annoying to receive an attachment in every single email.
<toothe>	this might be a client-specific thing, but is there a way to have PGP signatures and attachments *not* show up as attachments?
<bls>	toothe: that's highly dependent on the mail client and the signature method
<toothe>	bls: right..was wondering if there was a client that did that, or if...im just screwed
<toothe>	im not even sure wher eto ask this question :-(
*	toothe puts his head down.
<bls>	toothe: I know mutt can sign either the old, inline text way or the newer multipart way
<toothe>	oh? the multipart is the standard???
<bls>	the mulitpart way is a lot easier to detect and handle for verification from a client perspective
<toothe>	right.
<toothe>	which is s/MIME.
<bls>	I've tried both; I got tired of explaining it to people, turned it off, and eventually just quit using email for anything personal
<toothe>	:-(
<toothe>	bls: the lack of a central authority is the problem.
<toothe>	Trust...
<bls>	I disagree
<toothe>	encryption is easy, authentication is not.
<bls>	the whole point is to have the trust system distributed so a central authority can't manipulate it
<peetaur2>	bls: agreed... nobody can be trusted to tell others who to trust :D
<toothe>	right...i think i phrased what I mean wrong
<toothe>	bls: Meaning, how could you and I exchange a key securely?
<bls>	if there's no connection between our "webs", we can't
<peetaur2>	toothe: what I do is just email, push to keyserver, or send the public key however you want, then just read them the fingerprint on the phone or if I'm paranoid write it and deliver in person
<bls>	peetaur2: http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/x-files/images/f/f6/Trust_No_One_tagline.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20070529000016
<peetaur2>	voice over the phone can be faked, but you don't have to be absolutely sure unless it's something critical
<toothe>	voice over the phone can be faked....but I can't imagine the NSA is doing that :-)
<annihilannic>	they've had an actor as a president - why not national security too?  :-)
<peetaur2>	you don't have to be in movies to be an actor ;)
<annihilannic>	(the reverse is also true it would seem!)
<peetaur2>	it's all an act, isn't it?
<toothe>	also, i have a PGP key on the MIT key server that's been there since 2001
<toothe>	and I don't have th eprivate key for it
<toothe>	and there's nothing I can do about it ....
*	kopfkind is now known as kopfkind_
<Encapsulation>	has anyone else noticed that when things are happening you can keep putting stuff into the buffer I guess?
<Encapsulation>	I sometimes type a few commands while I wait and they all happen at once
<ayecee>	notice it? i _count_ on it.
<jacwib>	quit
<jacwib>	oops
<Encapsulation>	=D
<Encapsulation>	ttyl
<peetaur2>	ayecee: you must like to live dangerously
<peetaur2>	these last few days, I have been using some stupid citrix reciever crap and some putty crap with almost 5s lag sometimes, and it eats input like there is no tomorrow
<peetaur2>	the linux version doesn't even work, or have the features required, and has shared objects named xxx.DLL :)
<diphtherial>	hey, on debian-esque distros, it should be sufficient to do something like "iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5000 -j ACCEPT" to open port 5000 for business, right?
<diphtherial>	i feel like i'm going crazy; i'm running an http daemon on that port and everything seems to be fine (binding to address 0.0.0.0 so that it's listening on all interfaces), but for the life of me i can't connect to it
<diphtherial>	oh, never mind, i forgot that it's running on this stupid VPS service that requires additional config
<peetaur2>	diphtherial: depends... if it is designed properly, it wouold have a logging rule at the end, usually followed by a DROP; having ACCEPT after DROP will not do anything
<peetaur2>	-A is append; you would need to -A before -A the DROP, or -I $number to a position above DROP
<limbo>	or have the DROP be a policy, and -A away
<diphtherial>	peetaur2: ah, good point; i've looked at the list and there actually aren't any rules on it
<peetaur2>	limbo: except then your logging won't work at all
<peetaur2>	accept, accept, log,  drop policy.   then tomorrow    accept, accept, log, accept.... then drop policy
<peetaur2>	and I haven't seen any default implementations that have logging and also use the policy to drop... they usually make another chain that does both
<peetaur2>	like RHEL where you get no logs, so -A works, but everything breaking is completely silent :)
<I-baLL>	I came in here to ask a question about how to adjust mouse sensitivity in gpm, the Linux command line mouse daemon but I found my answer. The sensitivity setting is called the "responsiveness" setting. Reading up on it now

<superboot>	Hi Marezz. What's up?
<Marezz>	superboot, Nothing much, just relaxing after work :)
<superboot>	Marezz: Sounds good. Sip some adult beverage for me. I'm still on the clock.
<Marezz>	superboot, hehe well its so damn hot so i drink water XD
<bls>	}: nice
<superboot>	Marezz: Water is always good.
<limbo>	http://imgur.com/lDgPpsj  that hurts.
<JoeyPhats>	@limbo we use PMP as well...we quickly got rid of that LOW password settings.
<JoeyPhats>	That thing weak password profile was just asking for trouble.
<limbo>	JoeyPhats: I just tested it for evaluation
<limbo>	JoeyPhats: and if the first thing it tells me is I can't have more than 8 chars in my admin password, my evaluation is done.
<JoeyPhats>	limbo: its not a bad little product, once you figure out the quirks.  We've put in about half a dozen feature requests since we've implemented it.  It's because its setup to use that "Low" password profile..just change to use use the "High" one and it will allow much much more.
<SirLagz>	I don't understand why some places still insist on a maximum password length
<limbo>	I'm not gonna trust someone with all my passwords when their default limits me to 8 or less chars in my admin password.
<peetaur2>	limbo: hehe :)
<peetaur2>	limbo: the first time I saw solaris, I entered a nice long password, then logged in an typoed the 9th or so character and it let me log in... it silently chopped it off. I feel the same.
<jhodrien>	limbo: Yep, instead let the user type as many characters as they like, and only use the first 8 ;)
<jhodrien>	IRIX did the same.
<limbo>	peetaur2: yeah, that old shit :)
<limbo>	*nix did that for a while pretty much
<jhodrien>	One member of staff discovered that when we upgraded systems, and we discovered that they'd been using the wrong password for the last 5 years.
<peetaur2>	chopping it is just stupid... but silently? that's just idiotic; if your job has anything to do with security, do it right!
<peetaur2>	jhodrien: haha :)
<jhodrien>	Everybody likes a password with a final flourish though.
<peetaur2>	it's especially silly to limit length when the resulting hash is a fixed length :D
<peetaur2>	back in the day they had the excuse that tehy were too dumb to use a hash at all, but nowadays, there are still websites and other things that limit you
<bls>	I like the ' ; and " are not allowed password characters message on some of our intraweb apps. builds great confidence
<charginghawk>	I've got a command whose results I'm trying to output to a file, but at one I'm prompted for a y/n and this is interrupting my angle bracket or pipe
<peetaur2>	ERROR: "SQL-ERROR on line 1:  is not a valid password!
<zerowaitstate>	peetaur2: good ol' Bobby Drop-Tables
<peetaur2>	charginghawk: use anothercommand... with a script-friendly UI... like instead of parted, use parted -s
<peetaur2>	instead of fdisk use sfdisk, etc.
<zerowaitstate>	charginghawk: you can pipe the output of the "yes" command into it, but be careful
<peetaur2>	I think he mans his input "blah\n1\n2" is being treated like "1\n2" because blah becomes the answer to some question
<bls>	a y/n prompt should be taken as a sign that the command shouldn't be used in a pipeline
<zerowaitstate>	charginghawk: but yeah, peetaur2's advice is better if that's available
<charginghawk>	I'm really just trying to log the output
<charginghawk>	zerowaitstate bls peetaur2 thanks!
<bls>	you could try using something like expect as well

<ska>	I have a pdb in a complex python system with a handful of python daemons. The pdb can go off in any of my daemons.. How can I detect which daemon gets paused?
<bls>	might be a better question for the python channel
<ska>	Will it show up with a Suspend signal?
<ska>	bls: i'll ask, but they may just point me back here.
<tulcod>	I'm trying to use efibootmgr to install a UEFI boot entry. it says: "Could not delete boot variable: Input/output error".  What could be the cause of this?
<fxmulder>	so in fstab there is a 'defaults' option which appears to mean 'rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, and async', if I specify rw instead of defaults do the remaining defaults still apply?
<zerowaitstate>	fxmulder: no
<obXiDeJSFQ>	Hi, I'm doing two very high disk I/O items (One writing, one reading), the reading one has it's ionice set to realtime/0 (Very important process, must finish A.S.A.P.), but I don't want the writing one to be literally frozen (As it is right now). Would it be sensible to increase vm.dirty_ratio temporarily while the read process is completing (Will take ~24 hours)?
<fxmulder>	thats kind of confusing, that doesn't really sound like defaults then
<zerowaitstate>	fxmulder: well, the "actual" defaults are determined by mount, not by fstab
<zerowaitstate>	fxmulder: for example, fstab also contains swap volumes, which do not use the same options as filesystems
<fxmulder>	I understand the difference, the term 'defaults' would lead one to believe that if no options were chosed, the defaults would apply
*	quuique is now known as quuiqueee
<karlpinc>	papy: That's why a suggested m4.  Your macro file is your config file.
<zerowaitstate>	fxmulder: the mount(8) page seems to me to suggest that the kernel determines what is technically default.
*	tzoi516 is now known as _Cthulu201
<zerowaitstate>	fxmulder: I think it's probably safe to assume that they are the same, but I would verify in /proc/mounts to be sure
<xeon-enouf>	KekSi: tried   alias egrep='grep -E "$@"' ?  #be careful, my debian has a ELF as /bin/egrep, but a shell script as /usr/bin/rgrep - use file command on each, and/or name your alias something else
<karlpinc>	obXiDeJSFQ: If you don't want your read process to block all other io seems to me then you shouldn't set it to realtime priority.  Unless you want to put some calls to sleep in your app so that it releases time to other processes like a nice realtime program should.
<Wulf>	hi
<Wulf>	is there any tool to benchmark read performance of block devices? random reads with defined chunk size
<obXiDeJSFQ>	karlpinc: I would infinitely prefer the read process to block all other I/O and finish five minutes sooner than not and delay it by any stretch of time. This doesn't mean that if I can cache some writes until a more I/O-idle time I won't.
<xeon-enouf>	KekSi: I just tested what i mentioned here, it seems to be working! ;-)
<xeon-enouf>	whereas calling /bin/egrep, or not using the alias (in a separate terminal) does not show colorized matches (this presumes though that grep itself defaulted to colorized already)

<}>	obXiDeJSFQ, that was the output of journalctl
<xeon-enouf>	the -u = unit? the -b =?
<}>	just says it fails, exist status = 1
<obXiDeJSFQ>	xeon-enouf: boot, only prints logs since this boot. No point getting logs from 2013.
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	Sigh. What's the equivalent of tail -f /var/log/syslog with jourald/systemd?
<obXiDeJSFQ>	MouseTheLuckyDog: journalctl -f
<xeon-enouf>	obXiDeJSFQ: systemd existed back then? :-P
<}>	xeon-enouf, yes
<xeon-enouf>	heh.. i wonder if systemd also takes over dmesg?
<xeon-enouf>	as in /var/log/dmesg
<obXiDeJSFQ>	MouseTheLuckyDog: then if you want specific number of lines, use --lines, or a specific service --service, etc...
<}>	xeon-enouf, i dont think so
<xeon-enouf>	and possible /var/log/boot*  #though admittedly, not really helpful in many cases
<obXiDeJSFQ>	}: Manually launch samba's process using all the same stuff that systemd does (Config, environment, arguments, etc...)
<obXiDeJSFQ>	}: See if it fails there, if it does, Samba's fault, not Systemds, so then run it with verbosity.
<}>	might be a problem with my samba config, I'll copy an old one
<xeon-enouf>	Wulf: perhaps something at lbs.sourceforge.net  ala, bonnie++, iozone, etc etc?
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	How do you get a list of the services logged.
<}>	MouseTheLuckyDog, logged? do you mean systemctl --all
<}>	or systemctl --list-unit-files
<xeon-enouf>	KekSi: all told; i think i'm going to be keeping this egrep alias, and also making one for rgrep too! ;-)  (and if/when i want /bin/egrep (an ELF binary), or /usr/bin/rgrep (a POSIX shell script), i'll supply full path)

<Psi-Jack>	rsyslogd is an upstart service, IIRC, in Ubuntu, and the init.d script is just a wrapper telling you to stop using init.d :p

<hayonj>	RailRoadRunner: worked thanks !
<Fodd>	i've downloaded that, all it says is use my main drive
<Fodd>	not my "d" drive
<saymoo>	you cannot select a drive inside it?

<Psi-Jack>	Ewww.. Does wubbi actually still exist?
<Fodd>	or my USB drives. well card readers
<Fodd>	thank you for the thought though Saymoo :)

<Fodd>	lol
<mech422>	Fodd: that might end up with some grub/driver issues, as it will install the virt drivers and not the hardware drviers

<blind>	3.141592
<Fodd>	3.14237 somethin like that?
<Fodd>	okay smart arse
<blind>	that's as many places as i cbf to remember
<Fodd>	lol
<mIRC32>	Has anyone audited the selinux source code to make sure the NSA doesn't have a backdoor in it?
<}>	blind, the only reason I know that is because it's the latex version number
<mIRC32>	It's hard to trust anything they created
<desayuno>	the NSA has a backdoor in everything
<}>	blind, pdfTeX 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.15 (TeX Live 2014/Arch Linux)
<mIRC32>	Yeah, well, not OPENBSD
<magneticduck>	what exactly happens when I run a script that deletes the working directory and then recreates it?
*	} is now known as bsdbeard
<magneticduck>	I mean
<magneticduck>	it doesn't seem intuitive that ls /= ls $PWD
<magneticduck>	(in said scenario, "ls" returns nothing, "ls $PWD" returns what I intend it to, and cd $PWD actually affects my state somehow)
<deniska>	magneticduck: a directory is pretty much a file, so the same happens as if you delete a file
<magneticduck>	how so?
<magneticduck>	my question can be resumed to the following: why does "cd $PWD" affect my state at all?
<deniska>	because it changes your directory
<deniska>	which happened to have the same name, but it is a different directory
<magneticduck>	I see
<magneticduck>	what kind of "handle" does linux have on directories then, if a filepath is not the absolute answer?
<magneticduck>	I've never really worked with lower level unix
<deniska>	magneticduck: inode numbers
<deniska>	magneticduck: try 'stat' utility
<saymoo>	Fodd, eehm.. about virtualbox and disks
<saymoo>	lol
<deniska>	or ls -i
<saymoo>	it's not accessible with the gui
<saymoo>	you need to command line for that
<Fodd>	yeh, im having a look at CMD now
<saymoo>	https://romaimperator.com/?p=29
<lrvick>	So one of my admins did a dumbass: He somehow managed to set every single file in /home to +x . Naturally this breaks all sorts of shit.
<lrvick>	Can anyone think of a sane way to fix this?
<saymoo>	had a tutorial on this
<magneticduck>	alright cool that answers my question
<saymoo>	has*
<saymoo>	specific to windows
<magneticduck>	lrvick: chmod -R a-x ?
<magneticduck>	x)
<deniska>	lrvick: recursive +x doesn't often break things
<lrvick>	deniska: python hates it
<lrvick>	and other things
<Fodd>	Saymoo: thats the one im reading! Lol
<deniska>	lrvick: but the successive recursive -x does :P
<saymoo>	Fodd, lol
<saymoo>	:)
<lrvick>	yeah need to -x on everything but scripts with #! lines and binaries
<magneticduck>	lrvick: find?
<deniska>	(never heard python hating +x on files)
<lrvick>	deniska: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24495348/mod-wsgi-importerror-no-module-named-encodings
<john_f>	+X will take care of setting exec on directories
<lrvick>	mine freaks out identialyl to this post
<lrvick>	since the +x
<saymoo>	Fodd, once you've set that up, you should be able to use that disk directly with the vm.. just a the ubuntu ISO as first boot (cdrom) and you are good to go for the installation
<tuor>	hi, I'm about to reinstall my laptop. In past i was using /boot with ext4, /dev/sda2 -> crypt, and in the crypt partition lvm. Are there knew ways for complete system encryption? Or is this still "the" way?
<saymoo>	a = add
<Fodd>	thank you
<deniska>	tuor: you can use secureboot to protect the kernel
<acz32>	anyone have a good rsync incremental backup script they can share?
<deniska>	tuor: (if you happened to have UEFI on a system on which you can provide your own keys)
<tuor>	deniska, there is no EFI on it
<tuor>	lemovo x201
<Psi-Jack>	acz32: Sure. For $256.
<tuor>	s/lemovo/lenovo/
<deniska>	tuor: then there's no way to make /boot uncompromisable. Unless you take it with yourself, e.g. on usb key
<saymoo>	luks on all devices?
<saymoo>	ah yes, the /boot, cannot be crypted.. forgot that..
<bls>	acz32: rsnapshot
<saymoo>	however, since the other partitions are crypted (thus the thief still needs the phrase to unlock those)
<tuor>	ok. So the point is, is there "something" that can replace /boot ext4 & luks(lvm(ext4)) I mean is there a filesystem (or what ever) which can handle encryption, resize partitions, snapshots,...
<deniska>	saymoo: the concern is that someone will mess with a kernel when you are not around
<saymoo>	deniska, aah i see
<Fodd>	it should be booting up now :)
<acz32>	bls: thanks
<Fodd>	oh
<Fodd>	saying about enough free space
<saymoo>	deniska, tuor it is possible, without uefi, using luks and grubs GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK=y
<saymoo>	and such
<Fodd>	just keeps pausing now humm..
<tuor>	like: HD(Partition(MAGIC(/boot not encrypted, / encrypted, /home encrypted)))     so MAGIC should be something that can handle all what luks and lvm does...
<cyber37>	What is the bettr way for check if a VPN connexion is active, and turn of the network if VPN is not active ?
<saymoo>	tuor, see PM.. posting a link
<rascul>	Psi-Jack yeah the postgres/akonadi thing was me
<Psi-Jack>	rascul: Heh, well, it's awesome. :D
<rascul>	ahh you got it going now?
<luist>	is there any single sign on that allows me to use my linux login to login in some web tools that ill open?
<rascul>	Psi-Jack you can also use gpg-agent and ksshaskpass to keep ssh and gpg keys and password in kde wallet
<Psi-Jack>	rascul: Yep. Finally made the switch. Had to delete the mysql db_data directory, and re-download everything, but it's progressing through it.
<Psi-Jack>	Yep. I know. I actually utilize a tool called envoy with pam-exec module to pre-seed my GPG authentication from login.
<rascul>	did you finally find the config ui to switch akonadi to postgres?
<Psi-Jack>	UI? No.
<rascul>	heh
<Psi-Jack>	I think it's not yet implemented in KDE 5.
<rascul>	ahh ok
<Psi-Jack>	My Kontact 5.x was crashing a lot, and doing odd things, so I decided to jump the ship and change out to postgresql while I coul;d. :)
<Psi-Jack>	Suddenly... It's a crapton faster, and completely stable.
<BluesKaj>	what's postgres? , never botherd to look that up, rascul
<rascul>	my kmail is stupid slow at loading emails, it makes me angry
<rascul>	BluesKaj sql db
<BluesKaj>	ok thanks
<tuor>	can bios boot from gpt (with out problem)?
<Fodd>	Saymoo: the machines aren't installing, they just keep pausing
<Psi-Jack>	rascul: Mine's only slow because I added bogofilter and spamassassin.
<rascul>	i don't have it scanning em for spam
<saymoo>	Fodd, eeh, do you get the ubuntu screen?
<Psi-Jack>	I am however, beginning to think that was a bad idea. heh
<Fodd>	nope
<Fodd>	:(
<saymoo>	did you add it?
<Psi-Jack>	It's been updating my google mail INBOX for the past ~10 minutes. :/
<Fodd>	tried 14 and 15
<Fodd>	yep
<saymoo>	as first boot device?
<saymoo>	you can set the boot order of the vm devices...
<luist>	is there any single sign on that allows me to use my linux login to login in some web tools that ill open?
<Psi-Jack>	luist: Sure, just grab a box.
<rascul>	Psi-Jack ahh it's because i was letting it load the html
*	almostworking is now known as almostwrkin_phon
<Psi-Jack>	heh
*	almostwrkin_phon is now known as almstwrkin_phone
<Psi-Jack>	html isn't slowing me down...
<Fodd>	firstly, it says some probe failed
<luist>	Psi-Jack: uh?
<Fodd>	let me see if i can get a screenshot of it
<TaZeR>	are there any laws stopping me from compiling my own linux and selling it as a revolutionary desktop os for $500?
<Psi-Jack>	luist: Try making more sense. GIGO.
<rascul>	when i turned it off, they loaded quick
<TaZeR>	i want to claim retail linux as my own
<luist>	Psi-Jack: i want the user to login automatically into some web tools, based on wordpress, joomla and stuff
<rascul>	i'm not really happy with kmail though
<luist>	Psi-Jack: for that id like to use the only authetication he’s done atm, which is the system logon
<luist>	Psi-Jack: or an LDAP login
<Fodd>	Saymoo: http://snag.gy/G2mAd.jpg thats what i currently pause at
<bls>	TaZeR: nope, you're free to try
<Psi-Jack>	luist: There is nothing that. Try LastPass instead. :p
<TaZeR>	great, thanks i just got rich =)
<bsdbeard>	TaZeR, linux is and was sold
<bsdbeard>	there's even a fortune quote about it
<saymoo>	Fodd, see PM
<bls>	convincing people to pay $500 for something they can get for free, there's your challenge
<bsdbeard>	bls, people buy bottled water for $21
<bsdbeard>	a bottle
<rascul>	eww lastpass
<rascul>	i'm not gonna trust closed source stuff for my password store
<bsdbeard>	rascul, trust what? you never send your data unencrypted to them
<bsdbeard>	its unencrypted locally on the client
<rascul>	is the client open source?
<bsdbeard>	rascul, you can probably look at the browser plugin source, as for any browser plugin
<Psi-Jack>	rascul: lastpass-cli is.
<Psi-Jack>	For sure. :)
<bsdbeard>	rascul, there was a 2 hour talk about lastpass security and a security audit some years ago when it came to the market
<rascul>	i have firefox hooked into my kde wallet anyway
<Psi-Jack>	KDE Wallet is nothing compared to LastPass.
<rascul>	true
<bsdbeard>	TaZeR, here's the quote btw http://termbin.com/agix
<luist>	Psi-Jack: sounds good… does it have an API? can i insert user password for an specific website programatically?
<rascul>	i kind of need kde for my wallet to be useful
<bsdbeard>	luist, there's the "pass" utility if you dont need browser integration, its very easily programmable
<Psi-Jack>	luist: lastpass-cli with xdotool scripting where-needed, but it doesn't need it for website. :p
<fishbulb>	hello
<acz32>	why trust a closed-source password manager when there's good open source options like keypassx?
<fishbulb>	I have a 2x2 grid of monitors, two on each nvidia card
<fishbulb>	I made the mistake of updating this machine, nvidia will only support 3 monitors
<luist>	bsdbeard: i wouldnt mind browser integration, i just want to use the same credentials into these websites in a safe way
<luist>	bsdbeard: and automatically
<luist>	bsdbeard: and with a license that i can distribute preferably
<fishbulb>	I'm wondering if anyone uses 4 monitors successully with nvidia cards?
<Psi-Jack>	acz32: Because keypassx sucks.
<IP92>	I'm currently using linux mint, but I'd like to try something new. can you recommend anything?
<Psi-Jack>	IP92: www.distrowatch.com
<thedudez0r>	how can I compile this? https://github.com/runaos/iodfe
<l3archos>	please anyone, is there any tool available on Linux which allows me to alter multipage-PDF documents? I just want to be able to rotate certain pages, or remove some of them, change the page order, and stuff like that. Nothing more. I definitely tried about 7-10 tools and none of them are providing these feautures. I cannot believe there's no open-source tool available for Linux. any help appreciated
<Psi-Jack>	l3archos: Buy Adobe Acrobat.
<thedudez0r>	l3archos: wine?
<fishbulb>	hey I need 4 monitors to work
<bls>	PDF is a write only format unless you're using adobe's proprietary tools
<triceratux>	IP92: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/05/06/debian_jessie_review/
<l3archos>	Psi-Jack: sure, that's on option, But I don't want to BUY Acrobat
<fishbulb>	nvidia no longer supports 4 outputs
<RailRoadRunner>	bls: Not anymore
<Psi-Jack>	l3archos: Well, then don't do what you want to be able to do with a propriatery format.
<l3archos>	thedudez0r: I have wine yes, which tool do you suggest? Is there really NO LINUX tool available for that?
<bsdbeard>	RailRoadRunner, what?
<bsdbeard>	Last I heard the guy who reverse engineered pdf got sued
<thedudez0r>	l3archos: run a cracked version of acrobat reader idk
<l3archos>	grrr... damn it, f*ck adoeb
<adsjlkdk>	guys i need help please
<Psi-Jack>	l3archos: Stop using PDF. Use DjVu instead.
<acz32>	Psi-Jack: sucks to you maybe. it's amazing to me and nothing i need lastpass for that keepassx can't do
<thedudez0r>	can any compile expert around here tell me how am I supposed to compile this? https://github.com/runaos/iodfe - Whenever configure, make, make install don't work for me tears roll down my eyes
<Psi-Jack>	acz32: There's actually quite a few things lastpass can do that keypassx can't.
<l3archos>	Psi-Jack: DjVu ? can I save scanned documets with gscan2pdf in that document format?
<Psi-Jack>	l3archos: You can convert non-protected PDF into DjVu format.
<acz32>	Psi-Jack: read what i said. there's nothing i need lastpass for that keepassx can't do for me
<RailRoadRunner>	bsdbeard: You can create PDFs with ImageMagick and stuff, no?
<RailRoadRunner>	bsdbeard: And you can convert PostScript to PDF too
<bsdbeard>	RailRoadRunner, Right, but can you create postscript from pdf?
<RailRoadRunner>	bsdbeard: pdf2ps, I think so, yes.
<bls>	RailRoadRunner: that's writing PDFs, not inline editing them
<Psi-Jack>	PDF is a "final" format.
<RailRoadRunner>	bls: Oh, OK, the phrase "write only" threw me. You meant "write only" as in "not editable", sort of like whatever filesystem CDs use.
<qman>	ssj4pdf
<bls>	making an OSS PDF editor will go over about as well as OSS .doc and .xls editors
<RailRoadRunner>	bls: I convert to PNG, edit with GIMP and re-create when I need to "sign" a PDF.
<bls>	RailRoadRunner: right, which is what most people do, but a lot of people want to edit a pdf like they'd edit a .doc
<bls>	i.e. not convert back and forth through an editable format
<lrocket>	PDF is a pretty versatile format, there's nothing in there that says you can't edit them. Are you guys arguing about the tooling or the format itself?
<RailRoadRunner>	bls: Of course, .doc was also uneditable until recently. M$ didn't want people editing it w/o paying them.
<RailRoadRunner>	lrocket: With a legal open source tool is the question,  I think
<koala_man>	lrocket: similar to how there's nothing saying you can't edit a screenshot of a web site
<lrocket>	ah, okay. Sorry then. it's a textual format, so you can just edit it in a text editor, but you may go crazy whilst doing so
<fishbulb>	how would you go about setting up 4 monitors in linux
<koala_man>	editing a pdf is like editing a binary. of course you can do it, it just requires orders of magnitude more work
<fishbulb>	with two nvidia cards
<RailRoadRunner>	lrocket: Well, it's not pure text. Even uncompressed, it has some ugly stuff in it.
<bls>	and using free and legal OSS software to edit PDFs as produced by adobe software isn't something I know of as being possible
<RailRoadRunner>	bls I could've sworn Adobe released the PDF format publicly a while back.
<lrocket>	true, some of the objects and media and whatnot will just be r
<fishbulb>	there are open source readers for pdf
<lrocket>	raw data, I suppose. But you can edit the javascript in your safe and secure PDFs at least :)
<bls>	RailRoadRunner: they did for the base format, but they still have their own proprietary extenstions
<Psi-Jack>	Like I said... DjVu.. Better, smaller, and fully open.
<fishbulb>	I'm sure gimp supports pdf?
<RailRoadRunner>	fishbulb: But I think that's writing as an image, not actual text.
<bsdbeard>	Psi-Jack, and plenty of people who will refuse to install a djvu viewer
<Psi-Jack>	That's their problems.
<bsdbeard>	well it's your problem if you want your document to be read
<Psi-Jack>	Not really. :)
<fishbulb>	you can put text in gimp
<bsdbeard>	Psi-Jack, how so?
<bls>	hah, I had a hard enough time getting tech firms to accept a resume as a LaTeX produced PDF in the 90s
<koala_man>	fishbulb: thanks. very helpful.
<lrocket>	will djvu let you run arbitrary code? does djvu have an integrated opengl engine? I think not! clearly it's an incomplete standard
<jzelinskie>	anyone know off the top of their head how to get the output of `tar -v` into a file? if you use `-O` it literally writes the contents to a file — I just want the verbose listing in the file
<fishbulb>	gimp writes pdf files, isn't that exactly what you asked
<Psi-Jack>	bsdbeard: It's rather quite easy. I send a documented in a perfectly readable format, and it's not read because someone doesn't want to install a reader, it's like sending someone a pdf and them not wanting to install Acrobat (or something), to read it. Same end-result.
<bls>	jzelinskie: like tar -t ?
<Psi-Jack>	bsdbeard: However, I'm not responsible for someone refusing to read a provided document. It's theirs.
<fishbulb>	does anyone here have 4 monitors? nvidia dropped support for 4 outputs but I'm wondering if 2 spanned desktops is possible
<jzelinskie>	bls: it needs to be the exact output of extracting with -v — it’s for debugging purposes
<koala_man>	jzelinskie: shell redirection
<jzelinskie>	using `>` doesn’t capture it
<koala_man>	2> if it's written to stderr
<bls>	jzelinskie: how is tar -t different from tar -xv ?
<rascul>	jzelinskie is it printing to stderr? use &> instead of > if you want that too
<bsdbeard>	fishbulb, dropped support? can you use an older version of the driver?
<fishbulb>	bsdbeard no
<jzelinskie>	2> worked, thanks
<fishbulb>	I'd hvae to roll the kernel back to when nvidia had support for 4 monitors in linux
<jzelinskie>	what is `&>` vs `filedescriptor>`?
<fishbulb>	they put a max of 3 in all linux
<jzelinskie>	isnt that like tee?
<cnap>	guys question that may be or not irrelevant to you
<cnap>	The DTB = Directory Table Base exists for any process? Also, is it the table that holds all the virtual pages of a process ?
<rascul>	jzelinskie &> is stderr and stdout
<jzelinskie>	ah ok thanks
<rascul>	fd2 is stderr
<fishbulb>	if anyone googles nvidia multi monitor support linux you'll see they put a maximum of 3 monitors a year or so ago
<fishbulb>	maybe a bit more than a year?
<bsdbeard>	fishbulb, I don't know how to help then :( is this limit present for open source drivers too?
<rattking>	is that the time when they limited linux so it wasnt better then winders?
<fishbulb>	no I mean they did it only to linux
<fishbulb>	windows supports as many as you want
<fishbulb>	I'm not sure how to roll back the kernel to several years ago because it's a NIGN"
<fishbulb>	NIGHTMARE
<fishbulb>	not even sure it's possible and if it is, it doesn't seem worth it
<Psi-Jack>	fishbulb: So, complain to Nvidia.
<fishbulb>	linus torvalds already did
<bsdbeard>	fishbulb, maybe that's why they removed 4 monitor support
<mech422>	fishbulb: so drive 3 off the nvidia, and 1 off a seperate video card ?
<Psi-Jack>	fishbulb: So, do so, in the same manner, publically and brutally.
<fishbulb>	the thing is I have 2 nvidia cards, each with a dual output, they're on a motherboard that has sli

*	bsdbeard slaps shadok 
<shadok>	bsdbeard: i tried at least
<fishbulb>	mech422: there is no room for another video card, the motherboard supports 2
<mech422>	fishbulb: no onboard on the motherboard ?
<fishbulb>	if I could change for ati cards I would but I can't
<mech422>	fishbulb: sorry then, thats the extent of my 'help' :-/
<fishbulb>	mech422: the amount these cards struggle with a 2x2 video makes any onboard card pretty useless, unfortunately
<bsdbeard>	fishbulb, is there no one using nvidia with 4 monitors right now? that seems strange
<fishbulb>	2x2 monitor worth of resolution which is a phenomenal amount of data
<bsdbeard>	I mean somone must have come up with an answer
<mech422>	fishbulb: yeah - the onboard could just drive consoles or something and use the other 3 for X
<fishbulb>	not that I can find
<fishbulb>	I need these in a 2x2 grid format as a videowall
<fishbulb>	need/want
<mech422>	oh...
<shadok>	(or buy 4 raspberry pi)
<mech422>	fishbulb: as someone suggested - maybe try the open source drivers
<fishbulb>	yeah I did think of 4 raspberry pi
<fishbulb>	but the thing with those is you have to compress the video a certain way and all this other crap
<shadok>	fishbulb: i never actually tried it but i know about piwall
<fishbulb>	yeah you can't just open any video like I was doing
<fishbulb>	you hvae to encode it and compress it in the special format
<fishbulb>	it works but so far I've just been opening any video file and splitting it into 4 screens that get maximised on each monitor
<fishbulb>	I can't go through months worth of video and compress it all into the piwall format
<bsdbeard>	fishbulb, are you sure the open source drivers dont work as well as the proprietary ones? I mean nvidia couldnt have removed that feature from open source drivers
<shadok>	fishbulb: i didn't think you'd have to split the file, that's pretty bad if that's the case, i agree
<fishbulb>	with these cards I'm not really sure the open source one works at all
<bsdbeard>	fishbulb, what cards? theres a list on freedesktop I think with the cards that are supported
<nyuszika7h>	NVIDIA didn't make the open source driver
<nyuszika7h>	nouveau is reverse-engineered from the proprietary driver
<lrocket>	Woah, I didn't know about the nvidia driver crippling for geforce cards. Thanks for bringing it up, fishbulb :)
<adsjlkdk>	does this mean i need to edit my kernel http://pastebin.com/1AY4ccQb
<shadok>	fishbulb: but encoding months of video may be cheaper than buying a full video wall system
<fishbulb>	lrocket: yeah this basically means they sold me a product I can't use now
<bsdbeard>	adsjlkdk, I think that means you used a proprietary driver and now installed an open source one
<mech422>	adsjlkdk: yes, I recommend 'vi' for editing the kernel :-)
<fishbulb>	shadok I'd have to switch to ATI cards rather than some other retarded off the shelf solution
<fishbulb>	these are cards in SLI
<fishbulb>	the open source driver doesn't work, they have all kinds of acceleration and effects and other crap, it's a gaming system really, an older one
<shadok>	fishbulb: i'm not well versed in that topic but i know OTS solutions are crazy expensive
<mech422>	fishbulb: tbh, I don't think you need a fancy SLI just to drive full motion video unless your using HUGE resolutions...
<fishbulb>	mech422: you'd be surprised
<fishbulb>	each screen nearly 1080p
<bsdbeard>	adsjlkdk, can you show your kernel parameters
<mech422>	Fishbulb: mine seems to do full motion on two monitors at 1600x1200 ok ?
<fishbulb>	it'sa phonemenal amount of data
<bsdbeard>	adsjlkdk, cat /proc/cmdline
<bsdbeard>	adsjlkdk, if that has nomodeset in it you just need to remove that
<shadok>	mech422: even the gtx titan can only do 4K
<adsjlkdk>	this is what i got from cat /proc/cmdline ubuntu / # cat /proc/cmdline initrd=/ubninit file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper quiet splash -- BOOT_IMAGE=/ubnkern
<mech422>	mine is gtx780 ?
<fishbulb>	but anyway nvidia have crippled ALL of their cards
<mech422>	fishbulb: that does suck
<lrocket>	well, the whole thing does sound like a commercial agreemet with microsoft to me
<shadok>	mech422: same thing for yours, 4K max
<fishbulb>	it sucks because I paid money for them and now they don't do what I paid nvidia for them to do
<adsjlkdk>	bsdbeard: but im in chroot so idk if that changes anything
<Danol>	Hey
<shadok>	fishbulb: time to call the support and negotiate
<bsdbeard>	adsjlkdk, uhh /proc in chroot is from your main system, not the chroot system
<fishbulb>	shadok they put a 3 monitor limit on linux
<bsdbeard>	i think
<fishbulb>	I'm not getting anything from nvidia
<MrElendig>	amd is not any better
<MrElendig>	their drivers are horrible, and the cards are hot and slow
<shadok>	fishbulb: as it seems :/ http://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-linux-basemosaic-ubuntu-parity,24519.html
<fishbulb>	that's why I used nvidia
<fishbulb>	the amd cards aren't very good
<mIRC32>	windows xp > linux
<shadok>	MrElendig: read my link, nvidia reduced the number of supported monitors for linux in 2013
<lrocket>	ugh, we need more video card manufacturers :C
<shadok>	3dfs, where are you?
<shadok>	*3dfw
<bsdbeard>	3dfx
<shadok>	grmbl
<bsdbeard>	you turtle
<MrElendig>	shadok: uhm not really
<Danol>	So I have my Windows laptop connected to internet via WIFI and then I have raspberry pi connected to my laptop via ethernet cable. I have set up the laptop ethernet connection so it has static address and it should be able to share internet connection over it... I have also set up the raspberry pi to another static address (same mask, default gateway is set up to the laptop)
<Eburitus>	i'm getting mount error 115 while trying to mount windows 7 net share. i can ping between my linux and win7.
<MrElendig>	shadok: older nvidia cards only supported 2 monitors
<Danol>	But the raspberry doesn't have access to the internet :(
<mIRC32>	If there was a fight between Windows XP x64 edition and Linux who would win?
<MrElendig>	shadok: due to the hardware
<Danol>	I can ping each other successfully, but no internet on raspberry
<koala_man>	lrocket: we just need foss drivers so people can maintain these features if they want
<fishbulb>	I have two nvidia cards in an sli capable motherboard
<bsdbeard>	mIRC32, dannylee is that you
<MrElendig>	!ops silly troll is back
<fishbulb>	for the specific purpose of hvaing a videowall
<mech422>	shadok: I don't understand your '4k' comment ? 2 x 1600 < 4K ? so the cards should drive 2 monitors fine ?
<mIRC32>	no
<mIRC32>	I have no idea who is that.
*	ChanServ gives channel operator status to WildPikachu
*	WildPikachu sets quiet on $a:mIRC32
*	WildPikachu removes channel operator status from WildPikachu
<shadok>	mech422: i don't really know, i just looked at the specs and this is not clear: http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-titan/specifications
<mech422>	ahh - I know nada about the new 4k stuff
<fishbulb>	ok so I'm pretty much screwed and have to change cards?
<bsdbeard>	koala_man, I'm no expert when it comes to this, but it seems the FOSS open source drivers are good in linux, it's the FOSS opengl driver/mesa thats lagging behind a lot in quality and features
<fishbulb>	or ditch the whole machine
<Smuckerz>	mech422, the 4k stuff is just 4x 1080 stuff
<shadok>	fishbulb: i don't know but if someone sold the setup to you pretending they can do what you want you should ask them before reselling anything
<koala_man>	bsdbeard: the foss display drivers are not good, no.
<MrElendig>	bsdbeard: the free drivers are lagging behind badly too
<fishbulb>	shadok I built it
<Smuckerz>	then again there's like what... 3 movies that have been released in 4k?
<fishbulb>	why would I even be here if there was someone I could get my money back off :)
<mech422>	Smuckerz: ahh - thanks
<Smuckerz>	and most TV crap is barely getting to 1080, IF it's got to 1080
<fishbulb>	whatever comes after 4k I'm going to ignore for my whole life until they have retinal displays
<Smuckerz>	mech422, how'd 4k come up?
<koala_man>	when was the last time something on TV was released below 1080p?
<fishbulb>	even now I'm ignoring 4k as hard as I can
<shadok>	fishbulb: there must be a forum specialized into this stuff
<mech422>	Smuckerz: I was just saying, I thought you could drive two monitors full motion video pretty easily if it wasn't some insane resolution
<fishbulb>	not that I can find
<fishbulb>	most people who want a videowall buy a commercial solution
<Smuckerz>	koala_man, there's entire channels that are not in 1080
<fishbulb>	this was cheap and worked
<koala_man>	Smuckerz: what's a channel and how is it related to tv?
<fishbulb>	the alternative is 4 computers
<Smuckerz>	koala_man, American History Channel
<mech422>	Smuckerz: I thought fishbulb could pull one of his SLI'd cards and just throw in a non-nvidia one...but it appears he has other requirements
<Smuckerz>	koala_man, i'm watching it right this moment, and have been since yesterday
<Smuckerz>	koala_man, used to be the military channel
<fishbulb>	no I don't need 4k I was just saying that 4x hd = a phenomenal amount of data to push out to 4 screens
<fishbulb>	also how do I put an ati card in there in sli
*	woodruffw_ is now known as woodruffw
<fishbulb>	or amd or whatever
<shovel_boss>	how do i build a jet engine drone
<fishbulb>	it won't be in sli becuase the two won't be the same
<koala_man>	Smuckerz: are you talking about the 1990s style cable company carried video streams?
<mech422>	fishbulb: you don't - you get rid of SLI
<mech422>	run 2 'independent' video cards
<fishbulb>	ok
<Smuckerz>	koala_man, no i'm talking about Dish
<fishbulb>	I hate this solution
<fishbulb>	it means I have to buy more crap
<bsdbeard>	fishbulb, you could just install windows
<fishbulb>	and use two sets of drivers, and I dunno if this will even work
*	bsdbeard windows
*	bsdbeard hides
<Smuckerz>	hmm...
<Smuckerz>	yeah
<mech422>	try using the onboard for testing - IF it works, THEN buy more crap ?
<koala_man>	Smuckerz: that's entirely on Dish. all of History channel is 1080p
*	Smuckerz wants to see these SLI ATI cards
<fishbulb>	does xp support sli
<Smuckerz>	koala_mansorry i mislabeled that
<Smuckerz>	it's American Heroes Channel
<MrElendig>	are you running xp?
<bsdbeard>	fishbulb, probably best to ask that... not in ##linux
<fishbulb>	ok well I know for sure that the hardware nvidia sold now doesn't work in linux
<fishbulb>	this was a standalone machine and now I can't reinstall anything
<tenshi998>	hey guys I'm planning on buying a new graphics card for my desktop. does anyone know if the gtx 960 works on linux?
<tenshi998>	I had bad experiences with the gtx 750, system wouldn't boot + blacks creen
<MrElendig>	fishbulb: I use nvidia cards in gnu/linux with no problems
<bsdbeard>	tomog999, never boot into X directly
<bsdbeard>	then you wont have problems like that :D
<fishbulb>	with how many monitors MrElendig
<MrElendig>	tenshi998: that is often due to outdated firmware on the mobo
<MrElendig>	fishbulb: two
<tenshi998>	nope, my bios was up to date
<koala_man>	Smuckerz: it does seem to carry a lot of programming originally broadcast in the 90s so yes
<shovel_boss>	how do i build a jet engine drone
<fishbulb>	MrElendig: did you notice the part where I need 4 and where nvidia put a limit of 3
<tenshi998>	anyway, does anyone experienced any trouble with the gtx 900 series in linux?
<MrElendig>	fishbulb: yes
<adsjlkdk>	how do some people have 2 different kernels and how can i do that
<MrElendig>	fishbulb: but you claimed that nvidia cards does not work in linux
<bsdbeard>	adsjlkdk, what
<MrElendig>	as a general statement
<acz32>	this guy is still bitching about his 4 monitors? wow
<MrElendig>	which is false
<fishbulb>	no I didn't
<fishbulb>	paste the line where I siad that
<MrElendig>	23:02:23   fishbulb ╡ ok well I know for sure that the hardware nvidia sold now doesn't work in linux
<Smuckerz>	koala_man, and it's currently showing a program released on the 7th of March
<fishbulb>	and I'll give you one thousand dollars right now
<Smuckerz>	2014
<koala_man>	Smuckerz: which program?
<MrElendig>	fishbulb: thanks for the free monet
<MrElendig>	money*
<Smuckerz>	Nazis: Evolution of Evil
<stupid-1>	helllo...does kubuntu have firefox and other web browser..
<fishbulb>	ok thanks guys, I'm leaving before some fucking dunce starts an argument
<bsdbeard>	stupid-1, hello dannylee
<Psi-Jack>	fishbulb: Mind the language
<stupid-1>	hi
<tenshi998>	so could anyone please answer me? does the gtx 900 series work under linux with open-source drivers?
<shovel_boss>	is it possible to build a jet engine drone
<MrElendig>	tenshi998: the free drivers are 100% useless
<bsdbeard>	MrElendig, oh come on
<MrElendig>	tenshi998: on any hardware pretty much
<shovel_boss>	get amd
*	bsdbeard has been using foss drivers for 2 years
<Smuckerz>	koala_man, and i don't recall if it was last night or this morning, but there was a show on which was playing for the first time.  they do original programming.  the stuff from the 90's is generally filler over night
<MrElendig>	tenshi998: asuming you want to actually use your card, and not just run tuxpaint and nano
<adsjlkdk>	bsdbeard: some people have more than one thing when they do eselect kernel list how can i do that
<tenshi998>	well I had very bad experiences with nvidia with open source drivers, it wouldn't boot at all + black screens
<MrElendig>	tenshi998: use the blob instead
<bsdbeard>	adsjlkdk, modify your grub.cfg or /etc/defaults/grub
<stupid-1>	is kubuntu any good..will i get ten web browser and ten terminals...just like zorin 9
<bsdbeard>	stupid-1, you need zorin 10 to get 10 browser and 10 terminal, everyone knows that
<stupid-1>	ok
<Smuckerz>	hmm since we're chatting nVidia n' such, anyone got experience with getting optimus to work? i've got a GTX780m that i'd like to utilize...
<stupid-1>	i'm stupid
<stupid-1>	ill just watch a youtube video
<Psi-Jack>	stupid-1: Yes, we know. now get lost.
<stupid-1>	ya
<bsdbeard>	I'd like to believe dannylee is actually bill gates
<MrElendig>	Smuckerz: read up on bumblebee
<bsdbeard>	and this is what he does in his free time
<stupid-1>	i'm buying a new computer next week
<stupid-1>	i really like KDE
<Smuckerz>	MrElendig, yeah, have yet to be successful in getting it to work
<stupid-1>	Debian 8
<shovel_boss>	bsd is the future
<Smuckerz>	MrElendig, do you have any experience with it/might ya know someone who could potentially assist me?

<bsdbeard>	Smuckerz, oh, I thought you were referncing my nick
<MrElendig>	Smuckerz: ewww there is mold growing on the software
<MrElendig>	:p
<MrElendig>	also #debian for debian issues
<koala_man>	Smuckerz: huh, the youtube uploads from the channel of this show are all in 720p while the rest of them are 1080p. freaky
<koala_man>	not sure if their intern botched it or if the source material actually isn't available in 1080p
<Smuckerz>	koala_man, link?
<koala_man>	Smuckerz: https://www.youtube.com/user/MilitaryChannel
<Smuckerz>	MrElendig, you figure they would be the best to assist re: bumblebee as well?
<MrElendig>	since you are using debian, probably
<MrElendig>	since it is even more of a mess on debian than on most other distroes

<duckey>	Hey, I have some problems installing bootstrap on fedora 21. Any advice?? Cant find shit on google :(
*	Smuckerz rolls over to duckey and yanks them up by their bootstrap

<bsdbeard>	You're ruining tha ecnomy!
<Smuckerz>	bsdbeard, SSSSSHHHHHHH
*	Smuckerz only yanked up REALLY HARD on ONE bootstrap... (you know, not both of them... unbalanced application of forces and such... re: newton)
<duckey>	Really now, any advice??
<MrElendig>	duckey: yes, ask in #fedora
<MrElendig>	duckey: or atleast post actual errors
<Smuckerz>	duckey, other than anticipating surprises from sentient jars of jam as they roll up to ya
<MrElendig>	duckey: http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
<duckey>	MrElendig, I was banned. One of there ops acts like a complete d-bag to everyone and I was sick of it. I am trying to get a response in #fedora-ops now. I cannot find a single answer to my problems on google. In a certain scene , I am clueless.
<Psi-Jack>	Heh
<bsdbeard>	duckey, what exactly is the problem
<bsdbeard>	you didnt explain anything
<MrElendig>	I can see why you were banned
<MrElendig>	:p
<bsdbeard>	<thing doesnt work, plz help>
<duckey>	I have no idea how to install bootstrap. :(
<Psi-Jack>	I HAVE A BOX! And I was banned for talking around the box, but not about the box itself..
<MrElendig>	bsdbeard: my car is blue, halp!
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<bsdbeard>	MrElendig, there is no cure
<bsdbeard>	duckey, bootstrap the web front end thing?
<bsdbeard>	you dont install that AFAIK, but my knowledge of it is limited
<duckey>	yes
<bsdbeard>	you just... download it
<duckey>	You just, have to place it in a specific dir I think.
<duckey>	I have no idea which one...
<DeLilleD>	How do I redirect output from netcat to a named pipe? Running 'nc -l -p 9999 > out' doesn't open a listener (I checked with 'lsof -Pni | grep LISTEN ').
<koala_man>	DeLilleD: it's waiting for something to open the pipe
<bsdbeard>	duckey, you might get more help in a channel about web development
<DeLilleD>	so running 'cat > out &' should work?
<DeLilleD>	my command doesn't seem to work
<koala_man>	DeLilleD:  cat out &  would
<DeLilleD>	great, it works

<RavenII>	Annnddd I'm stumped...
<RavenII>	find -type d -name @eaDir -exec rm -r "{}" \;
<RavenII>	Is that syntax correct?
<bsdbeard>	RavenII, use -delete instead of -exec rm
<RavenII>	bsdbeard, both yield the same result.
<RavenII>	hang on, screen shot coming.
<MrElendig>	-delete is almost always better than -exec rm

<RavenII>	That's what I get when I do either or...
<MrElendig>	ewww busybox
<bsdbeard>	RavenII, busybox find
<bsdbeard>	not GNU find
<MrElendig>	it has a much more limited find
<RavenII>	yeah, this is on my qnap...
<RavenII>	gotcha.
<RavenII>	Ok, that explains that.
<MrElendig>	read the manual for it
<RavenII>	Will do.
<MrElendig>	you will probably have to do xargs or other ugly rhings
<MrElendig>	things*
<RavenII>	I even tried that...
<RavenII>	haha
<bsdbeard>	if the dirs are empty, and you have a working shell there, you can use extglob and rmdir
<bsdbeard>	something like rmdir ./**@eaDir
<bsdbeard>	with extglob on
<RavenII>	bsdbeard, I'll start reading about extglob...
<RavenII>	(I'm not too advanced in linux). Thanks for the guidance, guys. I thought I was losing it for a second.
<adsjlkdk>	how do i have 2 kernels installed
<poio>	Hi, I have a binary which I want to decompile, it is a kodi addon written in C++, Is it possible to decompile it?
<MrElendig>	adsjlkdk: because you installed two
<poio>	maybe with boomerang?
<adsjlkdk>	i mean how can i have 2 installed
<melonstorm>	adsjlkdk, system updates. It is only possible to use one at a time. Switching requires a reboot.
<MrElendig>	poio: you can decompile anything
<EriC^>	adsjlkdk: only one is booted right now

<MrElendig>	completely*
<MrElendig>	mibofra: someone has, yes
<MrElendig>	since intel have made over 10k of the boards
<poio>	MrElendig: It is a pvr client for kodi and the developer doesn't want to share his knowledge, is it ethical to decompile and modify it?
<bsdbeard>	MrElendig, what if no one ever bought one
<MrElendig>	bsdbeard: someone would still have them, namely people at intel
<bsdbeard>	:o
<MrElendig>	also they gave away a lot of them
<mibofra>	eh lol, I was meaning someone in this chatroom obviously
<MrElendig>	poio: if the license doesn't allow it? no
<bsdbeard>	poio, you can decompile it, but whether you will be able to reverse engineer aything is a different matter
<RavenII>	Interesting, I could swap the OS on my qnap...
<MrElendig>	poio: legally it is better to blackbox it
<RavenII>	to Debian...or freenads

<Psi-Jack>	Go on, free your nads.

<koala_man>	because these users are so 1337 that they don't have ubuntu problems, like "how do I make youtube work"
<MrElendig>	Skbila: like the eudev mess

<LinuxManDan>	It is a laptop that the screen turns and flips down to make it a tablet.
<LinuxManDan>	Lookin for one that will let me use it as a tablet, not just as a laptop.
<pid1>	I've heard that Gnome 3 has good touchscreen support, but I can't speak to it personally. I use neither Gnome 3 nor have a touchscreen device.
<Skbila>	MrElendig, I see. Well, what are some previous experience I should have before heading to exherbo?
<LinuxManDan>	I use Linux with Trinity on my desktop.
<MrElendig>	Skbila: being able to read documentation and use google/duckduckgo
<MrElendig>	Skbila: also requires some basic logic and common sense
<MrElendig>	http://arch.har-ikkje.net/gfx/common-sense.jpg
<MrElendig>	I miss the old exherbo homepage btw

<kloeri>	Exherbo is by far the best distribution for me personally but it's almost like that was made for me.. most people aren't quite as lucky
<MrElendig>	Skbila: arch + nix
<Skbila>	], About 6 months. But I'm willing to put effort to learn that's why I don't want a ready up distro like Ubuntu.
<Skbila>	MrElendig, + nix?

<MrElendig>	for installing spesific versions to $HOME, setting up containers to test in etc
<tulcod>	Skbila: source distros like gentoo and exherbo have an extremely high educative value. personally, i used gentoo for a while, and then realized i'm not that much of a purist and switched to arch. but i am *very* happy i used gentoo.
<triceratux>	Skbila: heres an example of its bad rep rofl https://blog.flameeyes.eu/2010/02/what-s-wrong-with-gentoo-anyway
<tulcod>	so yes i can recommend it, at least for a while
<LinuxManDan>	I don't believe I have used Gentoo before.
<Skbila>	Wouldn't you know if you did...
<]>	MrElendig, is that just a layer on top of pacman or it completely replaces it?
<LinuxManDan>	Not with my memory status.  lol
<Skbila>	If you used Gentoo, you would no matter your memory status.
<Skbila>	tulcod, Ah I see. What was your main reason to use it?
*	Lunatrius` is now known as Lunatrius
<LinuxManDan>	Okay than I guess I haven't
<Skbila>	know*
<MrElendig>	]: you use it in $HOME or in containers
<MrElendig>	and/or
<MrElendig>	you let pacman handle anything you want installed system wide
<adsjlkdk>	guys what the heck happened here http://pastebin.com/2cmJue8W
<tulcod>	Skbila: it was a challenge, it was configurable, it does some things *much* better than other distros (but i guess these days other distros like nix have even more innovative value)
<]>	MrElendig, so it's like GNU stow for your $HOME?
<MrElendig>	not really
<tulcod>	Skbila: if you've ever been annoyed by your distro's packages not being /quite/ like what you would prefer, then source based distros are going to be a big relief for you
*	nathanleclaire_ is now known as nathanleclaire
<MrElendig>	]: the GNU alternative would be GUIX which is a fork of nix
<MrElendig>	fork/based on
<]>	I'll have to set some time to try nix then
<triceratux>	Skbila: to be fair, gentoo isnt politics so much as ideology. some formidable anti-systemd theorists make it their abode & they have some invaluable perspectives https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7645524.html
<superboot>	Hi all. Anyone using elinks? I'm getting a loop on google search results? The page keeps reloading after about 1/2 second.
<MrElendig>	triceratux: there is *a lot* of politics and face factor in gentoo
<]>	superboot, I get that problem in w3m sometimes, it happens when you use https right?
<MrElendig>	triceratux: things gets rejected not on techical grounds but because "I don't like his face"
<Loshki>	superboot: I have elinks. What url causes the symptom?
<MrElendig>	etc
<triceratux>	rofl
<tulcod>	Skbila: let's put it this way. if you have some free time and want to learn more about linux, then you will enjoy the experience of having installed gentoo/exherbo/... for the rest of your life
<triceratux>	MrElendig: im not that deep into it at all. calculate is cool tho :)
<adsjlkdk>	http://pastebin.com/2cmJue8W does anyone know what this means please
<tulcod>	well, until GNU/Hurd becomes usable, i guess
*	hassoon laughs
<MrElendig>	triceratux: "he critisiced my code, therefor I will refuse to merge anything from him"
<superboot>	Loshki: If I type in the "go to url" box (hit g in elinks) and type: g test   and hit ok.
<superboot>	]: No I'm not using https.
<Skbila>	tulcod, You think? When you mean free time, how much free time are we talking about?
<]>	superboot, then I dont know, I get an infinite loop in w3m when googling sometimes but it seems to only happen with https
<Skbila>	When you say*
<superboot>	]: Thanks for trying.
<Loshki>	superboot: yes, it happens with my elinks too. Some kind of built in test mode?
<superboot>	Loshki: So you think it may be a "feature" of elinks?
<tulcod>	Skbila: a week would be a nice start I'd say. but opinions are divided i guess.
<Loshki>	supay: Either that, or it's bug...
<Loshki>	superboot: ^^^ (sorry supay)
<superboot>	Loshki: Ok. Strange.
<Skbila>	tulcod, Well, I got like 2 months free time so I guess I might dive in. Do you need any experience in low level programming or anything similar? (might be a stupid question to ask).
<]>	Skbila, you don't need any experience to use a source based distro
<]>	I don't know why some people consider this huge life changing experience
<Loshki>	superboot: Most browsers, if you just type "test" will look for a local file called "test". If I had to debug it further, I'd run strace...
<Skbila>	], Because there is only one time in life you lose your ass-virginity.
<]>	Skbila, Well I see you have a lot of experience in losing ass-virginity, but I don't know what this has to do with linux
<tulcod>	Skbila: no, not at all. but knowing a bit about what the kernel does definitely helps
<superboot>	Loshki: Ok. I may do that. It loops on any search, not just test.
<tulcod>	Skbila: also, don't expect to be enlightened by this adventure. it's just something that you'll keep in mind in your later linux adventures. it's not like there aren't other ways to learn the same stuff.
<Skbila>	tulcod, Oh okey. Because of the names "source based" I thought you might need some external experience.
<tulcod>	oh no it just means you compile almost everything yourself
<tulcod>	like, you type "make"
<]>	tulcod, it's not even that big of a difference compared to ABS+making your own pkgbuilds
<tulcod>	or not even that
<tulcod>	]: yes, but somehow no one does this. also there appears to be a big difference in mentality where PKGBUILDs need not be deterministic
<tulcod>	and ebuilds generally suggest "pass the same flags and you'll get the same binary every time"
<tulcod>	probably that's not technically true, but something close to that
<]>	tulcod, what do you mean with deterministic
<tulcod>	and pkgbuilds might configure differently depending on the packages you have installed
<]>	oh
<]>	well I have a crapload of PKGBUILDS
<]>	find -iname PKGBUILD | wc -l
<]>	64
<superboot>	Hey guys. I've got an NFS mount acting strange. I'm getting permission denied on a file with 640 permissions. I'm in the group the file is owned by. I've confirmed the GIDs between my system and the NFS server. Anything else I can check?
<Skbila>	tulcod, Do you believe reading a book about Linux first would be a nice idea?
<tulcod>	Skbila: no, just go ahead
<]>	tulcod, do you use arch now?
<tulcod>	it's not *that* hard or anything
<Skbila>	Well, I really also want to have time for development. Not sitting and configuring my distro 24/7 :p
<annihilannic>	superboot: reading or writing it?
<tulcod>	Skbila: well that would be a major reason not to use gentoo/exherbo/... for your production systems
<tulcod>	]: yes
<tulcod>	]: but i guess that's also a little bit out of habit. i know when it works and i know when it breaks, and that usually the devs are pretty good at fixing bugs so that i don't have to
<superboot>	annihilannic: Read.
<Skbila>	tulcod, Ah damn :/ Well..
<]>	tulcod, the maintainers are surprisingly good I think, didnt have any arch problems in a year
<annihilannic>	superboot: does chmod 644 on the server make it readable?
<tulcod>	]: i agree
<superboot>	annihilannic: yes
<tulcod>	especially considering it's a binary rolling-release
<tulcod>	but yeah somehow they manage to work everything out
<annihilannic>	superboot: what mount options?
<tulcod>	anyway gtg
<Skbila>	tulcod, Are you familiar with nixos or arch ?
<DarkElement>	guys how can i install my arch linux vm on vmware to a disk
<superboot>	annihilannic: mount -o ro 192.168.0.3:/share /mount/point
<MrElendig>	rsync, dd
<tulcod>	Skbila: yes, i use arch, and i read some stuff about nix
<]>	DarkElement, read the wiki, there's a page describing the process
<annihilannic>	superboot: mount -v | grep /mount/point
<]>	DarkElement, but essentially it's rsync + fix fstab + fix initramfs
<Skbila>	tulcod, Ah. How's Arch compared to Gentoo? Less time-consuming?
<MrElendig>	annihilannic: findmnt /what/ever
<tulcod>	Skbila: *IMHO*, in practice, arch has most of the advantages of gentoo with none of the disadvantages
<DarkElement>	ok i have no idea what those mean
<DarkElement>	wiki i go...
<annihilannic>	MrElendig: Thanks, new to me
<]>	MrElendig, oh wow thanks for that, didnt know about findmnt
<MrElendig>	been around for quite some time
<tulcod>	Skbila: but theoretically, there are quite a few superior distros - indeed, gentoo, exherbo, nixos
<]>	its like mount with an lsblk like tree
<superboot>	192.168.125.93:/share on /share type nfs (ro,vers=4,addr=192.168.0.2,clientaddr=192.168.0.9)
<]>	but better
<tulcod>	Skbila: but really i just want to run latex on a laptop and i don't need anything fancy for that. arch suffices.
<superboot>	annihilannic: 192.168.0.2:/share on /share type nfs (ro,vers=4,addr=192.168.0.2,clientaddr=192.168.0.9)
<]>	tulcod, do you use the texlive iso or just arch packages?
<tulcod>	just the arch packages
<Skbila>	tulcod, Yea really I don't need much stuff also. Just a compiler, a web browser and such.
<Skbila>	That kind of distro is what I'm looking for.
<annihilannic>	superboot: running low on ideas.. what OS each end?  output of 'id' for user at each end?  (I know you've checked, but, extra eyes...)
<tulcod>	Skbila: well yes, and i should keep any attempt to install fancy distros clearly distinct from that
<Skbila>	Now, that doesn't mean my laptop sucks. Indeed it's very very strong. I just don't like too much things.
<Skbila>	tulcod, heh
<superboot>	annihilannic: rasbian server, ubuntu client
<tulcod>	Skbila: like. install ubuntu or arch or whatever on your laptop, and install exherbo and nixos and openbsd on another machine
<tulcod>	(perhaps not at the same time)
<Skbila>	Laptop is what I only use :p
<tulcod>	Skbila: you *need* two (physical) computers if you're going to try fancy distros
<annihilannic>	superboot: I have both of those so could test, but unfortunately don't have access to the raspbian device from here right now
<tulcod>	because you *will* break your boot sequence
<]>	tulcod, just have 2 hdds
<]>	no need for 2 computers
<tulcod>	]: you're underestimating the power of a misaimed grub-install
<rascul>	or 2 partitions
<rascul>	booting isn't hard to manage
<Skbila>	tulcod, I see.
<tulcod>	rascul: if you know what you're doing, no
<]>	tulcod, I usually do a core.img only grub install, that is I dont install a bootloader
<tulcod>	rascul: but i'm talking to Skbila who is not very experienced with this I think
<Skbila>	tulcod, I think I might try nixos out. I hope it's not too time consuming really.
<superboot>	annihilannic: Thanks for the offer. Just strange. I've logged out/in my client user after adding him to the group. Do I need to reboot?
<]>	that is for each new distro I re-use an existing grub
<tulcod>	Skbila: if you're not ready to waste time you shouldn't get started with this :P
<annihilannic>	superboot: not usually. test on a local FS with a similar file to confirm.
<superboot>	annihilannic: Ah, good idea.
<Skbila>	tulcod, Well, I'm. But it's tedious if I have to configure the distro 24/7 instead of actually focusing on my development stuff.
<]>	tulcod, good point, I'm pretty sure I destroyed my bootloader when I first used grub
<]>	since then things have been much smoother
<annihilannic>	Skbila: or sit around on IRC instead of actually focussing on your develoment stuff.  :-P
<superboot>	annihilannic: Yeah, a file root:adm 640 is readable here.
<Skbila>	annihilannic, That made no sense. I'm getting advices so I can start.
<tulcod>	Skbila: that is definitely one of the reasons i'm not using gentoo anymore
<tulcod>	anyway good luck, i gotta go to sleep
<RailRoadRunner>	When I try to cp a file to my dir on a shared system, I get "cp: ./filename: Disc quota exceeded", although I think I'm under quota. How do I check how much diskspace the system *thinks* I'm using?
<annihilannic>	superboot: does 'stat filename' output look identical at each end?
<superboot>	annihilannic: I'll check.
<RailRoadRunner>	"quota" tells me "Disk quotas for user me (uid 1253): none"
<mikey>	RailRoadRunner: i'd ask your webhost for help
<RailRoadRunner>	mikey: It's a free host, so I was hoping it was something fairly basic. I've had files this size in my directory before. Sometimes, if I have a big file and delete it, I can't use the deleted space for a period of time. I was hoping someone would know how I could find out more about this.
<AlphaTech>	Does anyone know of an API that can allow me to make a bot for the kik messenger app?
<RailRoadRunner>	Oh woops, it's not Linux, my bad.
<mikey>	AlphaTech: uhhhh
<mikey>	http://dev.kik.com/docs/
<superboot>	annihilannic: All is the same except IO Block. on client it's: 65536, and on server it's 4096.
<AlphaTech>	mikey: That looks like a javascript library for creating applications that the kik app can handle. When loading the library in Node.js, it finds unknown commands and such JavaScript things
<templarx>	hello
<templarx>	why when trying to sudo echo it says permission denied
<templarx>	i am using ubuntu 14.04
<annihilannic>	superboot: sorry, no more ideas
<MrElendig>	templarx: sudo echo makes absolutely no sense
<RailRoadRunner>	templarx: Try "sudo date"
<MrElendig>	templarx: what are you trying to do?
<superboot>	annihilannic: Well, thanks for trying man. Cheers too you mate.
<templarx>	i'm trying to echo something into /etc/hostname
<templarx>	why does that not make sense?
<MrElendig>	templarx: running echo as root does nothing
<RailRoadRunner>	templarx: "sudo echo foo >> /etc/hostname"
<MrElendig>	the redirect is still done as your user
*	Sheraf is now known as Sheraf_
<MrElendig>	RailRoadRunner: .........
<annihilannic>	templarx: use 'echo blah | sudo tee -a /etc/hostname'
<MrElendig>	RailRoadRunner: EPIC FAIL!
<annihilannic>	templarx: (without -a if you wish to overwrite)
<templarx>	ubuntu@ip-172-31-36-200:~$ sudo echo thisdoesntwork > /etc/hostname
<templarx>	-bash: /etc/hostname: Permission denied
*	Sheraf_ is now known as Sheref
<MrElendig>	templarx: upgrade to 15.05 and use hostnamectl
<templarx>	there? see?
*	Sheref is now known as Sheraf
<RailRoadRunner>	MrElendig: Really? Let me try that.
<rascul>	sudo sh -c 'something > somewhere'
<MrElendig>	RailRoadRunner: the redirect is done by the shell, which is run as your user
<templarx>	"running echo as root doesnt do anything" wtf???
<annihilannic>	templarx: the > is handled by the calling shell, not the sudo
<mikey>	become root with sudo -s and use that
<RailRoadRunner>	MrElendig: Wow, you're right.
<templarx>	i dont want to become root
<annihilannic>	superboot: if you email me at <mynick>@hotmail.com and I get an opportunity to try it later, I can send you the result
<templarx>	i want to be able to echo into files using sudo
<templarx>	i havent seen this issue before why is it happening
<rascul>	there were solutions provided
<MrElendig>	templarx: that is becoming root
<superboot>	annihilannic: Sure thing. :)
<rascul>	three of them, in fact
<MrElendig>	(for a really short while)
<templarx>	i mean.. i dont want to swtich user to root
<RailRoadRunner>	templarx: There's always "chown [user] /etc/hostname" or "chmod a+rwx /etc/hostname" I suppose
<MrElendig>	RailRoadRunner: never ever suggest that
<RailRoadRunner>	templarx: Or write a shell script and sudo the whole script?
<rascul>	[19:43] <annihilannic> templarx: use 'echo blah | sudo tee -a /etc/hostname'
<annihilannic>	templarx: I explained why it's happening and how to get around it
<rascul>	[19:43] <rascul> sudo sh -c 'something > somewhere'
<templarx>	i see
<Swifftynob>	hey i have a question about a linux program and can not find an answer anywhere
<Swifftynob>	can i change the userlist in 3proxy without restarting it?
*	robink_ is now known as robink
<templarx>	is it possible to chnage the colour of individual terminals ?
<templarx>	in ubuntu
<]>	templarx, which terminal
<RailRoadRunner>	templarx: You mean like xterm, rxvt, or what?
<hiiambo>	hey folks. im trying to connect to an iscsi target over the internet. running the discovery is fine and doing an iscsiadm -m discovery lists the proper WAN address via sendtargets. however, if i try to --login, it attempts to connect ot the LAN IP and fails. if i set a manual portal address to the WAN port it tells me therea re no records found. any suggestions?
<templarx>	i'm using ubuntu 14.04
<templarx>	so whatever the default terminal is
<DarkElement>	guys how do i know my login for arch linux
<DarkElement>	I just set the passwd but Idk what the login is
<RailRoadRunner>	templarx: If you do "ps -ax | grep rxvt" and "ps -ax | grep xterm" what do you see?
<]>	DarkElement, the prompt shows the user in the terminal
<RailRoadRunner>	templarx: And yes, you can color either of those
<DarkElement>	I'm seeing "DarkElement login:"
<DarkElement>	But when i tried darkelement in terminal it was incorrect
<DarkElement>	it was just root, my bad
<acz32>	DarkElement: you don't know how to check what user you are but you use arch linux?
<DarkElement>	I'm just now getting it working
<MrElendig>	RailRoadRunner: that is horrible
<]>	DarkElement, he set his hostname as DarkElement, and used passwd to set roots password instead of creating a new user
<]>	oops, acz32 ^
<RailRoadRunner>	MrElendig: There are probably better ways of doing it, but that does work, no?
<MrElendig>	RailRoadRunner: "works"
<MrElendig>	RailRoadRunner: -C and pgrep exists for good reasons
<]>	RailRoadRunner, ps ax | grep thing will always return something, just use pgrep
<MrElendig>	and you probably don't want a
<MrElendig>	in this context
<RailRoadRunner>	OK, OK, yes, grepping will return the grep process itself, but close enough, sheesh
<MrElendig>	it is like cat | grep or sudo su
<MrElendig>	sure it works, but it is still bad advice
<]>	or cat file | thing
<acz32>	better than no advice, which is what templar was getting
<acz32>	even though he should have been asking in #ubuntu
<]>	acz32, well, the advice doesnt answer his question at all
<]>	and it's unlikely that ubuntu uses rxvt instead of gnome-term or similair
<acz32>	it took two random guesses at what the terminal might be, which was weird ya
<MrElendig>	it is unlikely that any distro still uses rxvt
<pingfloyd>	he would have been off asking about to change the color in Terminal X
<MrElendig>	or even package it
<]>	MrElendig, arch packages it
<]>	not that I reccomend using it
<MrElendig>	]: no
<acz32>	the advice "ps x" by itself would have been better advice
<]>	MrElendig, community/rxvt 2.7.10-7
<MrElendig>	hmm it is not removed yet
<MrElendig>	it is on the list
<pingfloyd>	urxvt is pretty pervasive now
<AlphaTech>	mikey: Find anything yet?
<acz32>	urxvt is what all the cool arch kids use
<pingfloyd>	templarx: anyway, it really comes down to which terminal emulator that you're talking about and which colors you mean
<MrElendig>	termite!
<]>	termite? /me calls pest control
<acz32>	termite or urxvt + i3 is in these days
<pingfloyd>	I'm not on arch and I use i3
<pingfloyd>	I like its simplicity
<]>	pingfloyd, well step right over here and get your certified 100% cool kids badge
<pid1>	I've seen a couple people's dotfiles that used urxvt. Any compelling reason to switch?
<pingfloyd>	no thank you
<]>	pid1, plugins, you write perl plugins for them
<pingfloyd>	pid1: are you asking a reason to switch to urxvt?
<pid1>	Just curious why it was popular.
<pid1>	I'd been noticing it popping up recently.
<pingfloyd>	it's strength is performance and unicode support
<]>	its popular because someone said people should use it, and they started using it
<]>	nothing to do with its functionality
<pingfloyd>	but there's tons of terminal emulators.  I comes down to preference.
<pingfloyd>	but take certain roguelikes for instance, you really want to use say xterm or urxvt in those.
<]>	pingfloyd, you certainly dont
<pingfloyd>	unless you don't mind walking slowly on a large map
<pid1>	^I was using terminator for the easy window splitting, but I just switched to i3, which makes that redundant.
<annihilannic>	I use tmux for my window splitting, works in everything.  :-P
<fy_icewurld>	how would you dd straight out of your hd device into tar.gz file? I know you gotta pipe dd into tar but I'm wondering how would that look
<pingfloyd>	]: ones that scroll it makes a difference compared to a vte based terminal emulator
<]>	pingfloyd, urxvt is quite a slow terminal, it takes lots of configuring to get it to a bearable speed
<pingfloyd>	it's not slow here
<annihilannic>	fy_icewurld: tar doesn't understand raw
<pingfloyd>	I'm not running anything special either
<]>	pingfloyd, "not slow" is irrelevant, it's slower compared to xterm and others
<annihilannic>	fy_icewurld: just dd straight into gzip
<]>	pingfloyd, you can benchmark it very easily
*	Padawan_ is now known as Padawan
<fy_icewurld>	damn
<pingfloyd>	I didn't say xterm was slow
<MrElendig>	or better, don't use dd in the first place
<annihilannic>	fy_icewurld: or use an FS dump utility if don't want to mount it.
<DynamicMetaFlow>	Could anyone help me? I'm trying to get the backtick or the key above the tab to function. Initially when i log in for a few seconds it works but then the key just changes the application's focus. Running ubuntu
<fy_icewurld>	annihilannic, any suggestion?
<annihilannic>	fy_icewurld: describe your use case first?
<fy_icewurld>	I'm going to make a backup out of these "google persistent storage disk" which are virtual disks that you can mount/unmount from any number of vm's. Thing is there's an option somewhere in the gui control panel where you can create image disks out of .tar.gz files containing the filesystem
<]>	pingfloyd, for roguelikes you want settings like this : http://termbin.com/n8ax
<annihilannic>	fy_icewurld: Why not just mount and tar it up then?
<pingfloyd>	]: performance in usage between the two enough that unicode support is more of a deal breaker
<fy_icewurld>	and then you can create instances with those images as root disks, or indeed create any other number of regular disks
<fy_icewurld>	annihilannic, well I can do that. I was reluctant because I was worried that having mounted it somehow tar could miss something that dd didn't
<annihilannic>	fy_icewurld: nothing that should affect you booting from it.
<annihilannic>	fy_icewurld: tar was originally conceived as a backup utility, after all.
<fy_icewurld>	yes but these are ufs disks. You can mount a slice, but not the entire disk
<annihilannic>	fy_icewurld: tar doesn't (necessarily) care what filesystem the files are on, you can just tar the whole lot from /
<DynamicMetaFlow>	Anyone? backtick not working keyboard default US creates a minor inconvenience
<annihilannic>	fy_icewurld: as long as google doesn't care that they used to be on separate FS before that is.
<pingfloyd>	DynamicMetaFlow: what?
<annihilannic>	pingfloyd: what?
<]>	annihilannic, what?
*	annihilannic was waiting for that!
<]>	spent 2 hours debugging a bug, which was caused by a unicode character that looks exactly like the ASCII 'a'
<]>	time to go to sleep
<stupid-1>	you can do any thing with emacs...emacs might really be GOD
<stupid-1>	vim is C0000L to
<pingfloyd>	I see dannylee is up to his usual troll baiting habits
<annihilannic>	NOTEPAD.EXE surely is the best.
<occupant>	I'm just going to suspect autism until a better explanation comes along
<SpiceMan>	inb4 ed
<pingfloyd>	some sort of compulsive behavioral issue
<pingfloyd>	but those are dime a dozen on irc.  Irc as an entity is a total nut-job.
<xjkx>	I'd like to check my ink levels of printer. My printer is printing fine, I have not installed anything, must have came something installed on ubuntu. So I was afraid of installing hp-lips, replacing then this software that is working (that I don't know what is), and then it stop working

<SpiceMan>	Tordek: yes, planning ahead and running  command1 && command 2
<SpiceMan>	and it runs command2 when command1 finishes successfully automagically!
<annihilannic>	Tordek: is it a child process of your shell?  i.e. can you use the 'wait' built-in?
<toothe>	do ubuntu or mint have a truecrypt replacement?
<Tordek>	annihilannic: no, I'm asking for the general case
<annihilannic>	toothe: is encfs available for them?
<toothe>	im not familiar with that...
<toothe>	I'd like to have something I can put on a flash drive and use for general purpose needs.
<annihilannic>	toothe: I think that's the logical replacement, package is available to me (lts14)
<toothe>	oh?
<annihilannic>	toothe: and i just installed cryptonite on my android phone which supports it
<toothe>	same system?
<annihilannic>	toothe: don't know the details
<toothe>	i need to organize my passwords better. I have a bit too much redundancy...i'll fix that tonight
<xangua>	12345
<annihilannic>	toothe: I only learnt yesterday that TrueCrypt development was discontinued, that's how up-to-date I am ;-)
<toothe>	its "insecure"
<annihilannic>	xangua: how did you...?!?
<Sybilus>	Anyone tried Archbang?
<shadok>	toothe: http://istruecryptauditedyet.com/
<templarx>	i use ubuntu because i am a noob
<templarx>	and its pretty
<toothe>	templarx: nothing wrong with that
<toothe>	can I ask how old you are?
<templarx>	i came here for learning... sorry
<templarx>	i am 24
<toothe>	templarx: and you're more than welcome!
<templarx>	english not very good
<toothe>	where are you from?
<templarx>	sweden
<toothe>	Nice!
<toothe>	Welcome!
<templarx>	thank you friend
<toothe>	my family is from Pakistan
<toothe>	and they don't speak english all that well either...
<templarx>	i have never been
<Sybilus>	Any thought on archbang?
<toothe>	templarx: But really, you're more than welcome here. Its exactly for people like you.
<toothe>	templarx: Besides, Swedes are Sweet
<shadok>	toothe: i'll take a korma anytime over hakarl :p
<Sybilus>	I have a PhD from KTH in Sweden :)
<toothe>	shadok: yes, I read the report a year or so ago?
<toothe>	shadok: there was another one other than this.
<shadok>	toothe: they just had the phasz 2 of the audit released
<shadok>	*phase
<toothe>	the truecrypt story is kinda bizarre...
<toothe>	just randomly its "broken" and the guy writing it disappears mysteriously.
<shadok>	yup, the devs are still anonymous but nothing strange was found during the audits
<shadok>	that's strange, i agree but i still have more confidence in it than some other solutions
<annihilannic>	Anyone using VeraCrypt or Cipher...something, the other fork?
<toothe>	there's 3....
<templarx>	i am learning linux, and puppet.. soon i will be a very good system admin
<toothe>	what would be nice if they were compatible.
<shadok>	annihilannic: nope, because there is no aaudit about it, that's my reason
<toothe>	actually, thatwould be ideal. three competing tools that have the same standard.
<shadok>	templarx: if you have time look at ansible or saltstack
<annihilannic>	we are just switching from puppet to ansible
<annihilannic>	puppet is crazily overengineered for ourpurposes
<shadok>	annihilannic: i'd say they get together pretty well but i don't see how ansible can replace puppet in a hosting environnement
<templarx>	i am using ansible too
<templarx>	i have already written everything for ansible
<templarx>	we need to compare two
<templarx>	to see which is better to manage windows
<shadok>	annihilannic: puppet makes sure your config is right, ansible allows you to make atomic changes to your services, that's how i see it
<shadok>	annihilannic: s/your config/your system config/
<annihilannic>	ansible seems to be far more sysadmin compatible, getting some people to use puppet has been too hard, the ansible learning curve seems to be more forgiving
<templarx>	also i like the ansible community better they are more friendly
<shadok>	annihilannic: for me ansible is about actions, puppet is about state
<annihilannic>	shadok: I'm no expert yet, but from what I've see ansible playbooks manage state well enough too
<shadok>	annihilannic: want to change a vhost and reload apache? -> ansible ; want to change the ip and revoke some ssh keys on 300 servers -> puppet, that's how i see it
<templarx>	puppet have better windows support
<annihilannic>	templarx: not something I care about much :-P
<shadok>	annihilannic: yep but you don't have a deamon checking the files at all times and i'm reluctant to use cron with ansible to replace that, have a look at foreman
<annihilannic>	shadok: we're using that
<shadok>	templarx: we are on ##linux, even puppet and ansible are out of topic, windows doesn't exists here
<shadok>	annihilannic: so: foreman + puppet to get a vm up; ansible to build services on those templates
<templarx>	lol i know but it is worth mentioning ^^
<shadok>	annihilannic: but it depends greatly on how you see PaaS, some prefer docker and kubernetes to build the services and it's allright toot
<shadok>	i cannot stay much longer but have a nice talk guys and good day/night, just so you know you can get on #puppet and #ansible if needed
<annihilannic>	seeya
<shadok>	:)
<Asad3ainJalout>	Hey guys, I have a weird issue, regarding sudo and su. Basically if i run sudo it wont autocomplete any commands, other than that it works. the other issue is if i sudo or su, and run wpa_gui, it flat out wont work, i can post the error up if anyone wants it. if i go to another tty and login as root and type wpa_gui it works fine.
<andrew39>	Asad3ainJalout, that's the default behavior afik
<andrew39>	ie if you type "sudo " as a regular user, it wont autocomplete your query
<andrew39>	but
<andrew39>	if you were to switch to root, it would
<Asad3ainJalout>	andrew39, In the 4 year I have used linux, I have never come upon this.
<Asad3ainJalout>	andrew39, well can i fix it? its a pain to have to always switch to another tty juts to use wpa_gui
<annihilannic>	Asad3ainJalout: Do post the error up.
<andrew39>	Asad3ainJalout, you dont need to switch to another tty to switch user
<annihilannic>	Asad3ainJalout: I'm guessing it does work if you run 'sudo -i' and then wpa_gui?
<andrew39>	as far as changing it to complete your query when you type sudo, i dont know
<Asad3ainJalout>	http://imgur.com/fPY3S4t
<Asad3ainJalout>	the last bit repeats endlessly until you close the window
<toothe>	nice name
<toothe>	Asad, Ayn Jaloot
<Asad3ainJalout>	toothe, Yah it's the nickname of the first general to beat the mongols in heavy cavalry combat, i like it :P
<toothe>	YES! I forgot his name...but he fought them at Ayn Jalout
<toothe>	and defeated them at that location, thus proving that the Hordes could be defeated
<Asad3ainJalout>	toothe, Qutuz I believe was his name
<toothe>	YES!
<toothe>	and he had an ally in SYria...Malak 'Aadil?
<Asad3ainJalout>	annihilannic, I will try the sudo -i now
<toothe>	hal anta 'arabi?
<Asad3ainJalout>	annihilannic, it brings up the same error i put up in the pictures
<Asad3ainJalout>	toothe, nous 3arabi
<annihilannic>	ok, seems like xauth issues of some kind.
<Asad3ainJalout>	annihilannic, anywhere I can read up on that? I like to try and learn for myself :D
<annihilannic>	annihilannic: Unfortunately I'm gui-less so i can't experiment.  If you search for those error messages you sould find something?
*	ubuntu is now known as Guest44599
<andrew39>	annihilannic, user lynx ;)
<toothe>	Asad3ainJalout: ana 3sli bakistani laakin afham 'arabi.
<annihilannic>	especially the first one, I believe the later ones are as a result of the first.
<shadok>	toothe: soooo #history ;o
<annihilannic>	andrew39: I'm not googling for him :-)  I meant to try wpa_gui
<toothe>	shadok: lol yeah :-)
<Asad3ainJalout>	annihilannic, I came here after searching google for the errors, got some ubuntu stuff, im checking the arch wiki now for the xauth
<Asad3ainJalout>	annihilannic, I asked not to get googles fo rme, but sometimes, there are better sites that are not immediatly visible is all.
<annihilannic>	Asad3ainJalout: understood
<shadok>	Asad3ainJalout: just so you know, the archwiki is what the gentoo wiki was ten years ago: a great source of knowledge
<Asad3ainJalout>	shadok, its the reason i switched to arch about 2 years ago. ive only had this sudo problem show up after installing fresh on the new laptop i bought
<shadok>	Asad3ainJalout: sudo problems are generally solved with the following incatantion:  man sudoers
<shadok>	if not _you_ are the problem :p
<Asad3ainJalout>	shadok, Its not unlikely the problem is an ID 10 T error, because i did read the sudoers man page to set up sudo when i first installed arch
<shadok>	hehe, that happens to everyone :)
<bushido_>	any plese check that config ? http://pastebin.com/rxpTEBCL focused color showing blue . but i change it something else

<Silenced_v2>	Guys , what is the latest version of linux kernel. I need the repo of Linus torvalds
<Silenced_v2>	Can someone send me the link of it
<zerowaitstate>	https://www.kernel.org/
<Silenced_v2>	zerowaitstate: Thanks man !
<zerowaitstate>	Silenced_v2: np
<Silenced_v2>	zerowaitstate: Dude u heard about the kernel challenge ?
<Silenced_v2>	zerowaitstate: Eudyptula Challenge
<GreeningGalaxy>	Really regretting all that time I spent not using xfce right now, lol
<zerowaitstate>	Silenced_v2: no, but it is interesting.
<annihilannic>	Would you be enjoying it as much if you didn't know how the other half lived?
<diegoviola>	would a system with a kernel with a broken ACPI consume more energy (i.e. your energy bills going up) than one with proper ACPI support?
<zerowaitstate>	Silenced_v2: have you done kernel-space work before?
<GreeningGalaxy>	diegoviola: I doubt it would amount to anything significant on an energy bill, unless you were running racks and racks of servers with bad acpi or something
<Silenced_v2>	zerowaitstate: In task 02 they said to build the latest kernel
<neonrooster>	what's a Linux that just works that is not Arch, Fedora, or Debian based?
<diegoviola>	GreeningGalaxy: no, just a standard desktop PC
<neonrooster>	can I have Exherbo?
<zZultan>	neonrooster, slackware
<zerowaitstate>	Silenced_v2: yeah, that's no too bad really. Kernel building is very streamlined these days
<GreeningGalaxy>	diegoviola: from my experience with running Ubuntu sans acpi on an old laptop, it just meant a slightly lower battery life.
<GreeningGalaxy>	slackware "just works?"
<zZultan>	every time i've ever installed it, yeah
<GreeningGalaxy>	i thought it was one of those really involved distros
<SirLagz>	diegoviola: about the only thing I can think of that could possibly have a big effect and possibly be ACPI related is turning the monitor off when idle. Apart from that, I don't think anything else would have a huge effect.
<diegoviola>	GreeningGalaxy: I see, thanks
<Silenced_v2>	zerowaitstate: But the matter of fact i downloaded the latest git repo of torvalds and they say its not the latest . ! WTF
<diegoviola>	Silenced_v2: thanks
<Silenced_v2>	zerowaitstate: I never tried kernel-space . May be i should
<neonrooster>	zZultan, WOW
<zZultan>	GreeningGalaxy, yes if you are straying form the official packages it goes more in depth  with having to run ./configure --prefix=$/path/to/install-dir && make -j4 && make install
<Silenced_v2>	diegoviola: Why thanks ?
<neonrooster>	zZultan, I need to put it on a USB flash drive: no CD-ROM drive. How do I do that?
<zZultan>	they got slackbuilds too, but i don't bothr with that  i don't run many programs really
<zerowaitstate>	Silenced_v2: programming in the kernel is different from programming in user-space. certain things the operating system provides aren't available, because you're providing them.
<zZultan>	dd the image to a usb drive
<zZultan>	i guess, i dunno always have cd's handy here
<GreeningGalaxy>	how do you define "just works" anyway? like, your post-installation system will have a fully usable GUI which just needs a few point-and-click customizations and apt-get installs, or does it mean "Unlikely to break beyond repair shortly after installation?"
<diegoviola>	Silenced_v2: oops, wrong nick, sorry
<Silenced_v2>	zerowaitstate: Ofcourse yes .
<zerowaitstate>	Silenced_v2: and you have to pay attention to subtle things like the alignment of variables in memory, etc.
<neonrooster>	zZultan, thanks! Would you explain Slackware to a new Linux user?
<GreeningGalaxy>	I would call Ubuntu, Mint, Elementary OS, etc etc your 'just works' distros. anybody with a little understanding of typical UI layouts can install them and use them effectively out of the box.
<zZultan>	neonrooster, in how many words?
<Silenced_v2>	zerowaitstate: OH okay ! May be suggest me a good link to learn some key topics regarding kernel programming
<GreeningGalaxy>	I would not extend that terminology to, say, Arch, which requires days of wiki reading and manual labor to get working properly.
<neonrooster>	GreeningGalaxy, is slackware same as arch?
<neonrooster>	in that it takes days to configure it?
<GreeningGalaxy>	I don't know
<zZultan>	neonrooster, pm me if you have questions if i'm not busy i'll respond, but i can make no guarantee in how vague or not my answers will be
<GreeningGalaxy>	I've heard it mentioned in the same sentence as Arch before
<GreeningGalaxy>	but I have never used it.
<neonrooster>	is 1.8MB/s down impressive?
<ceil>	neonrooster: do you live within ten miles of your nearest neighbour?
<neonrooster>	it's MiB/s down
<neonrooster>	ceil, yes sir
<ceil>	not rly
<neonrooster>	they are right next door
<GreeningGalaxy>	neonrooster: depends on your standards. I regularly get 40 MiB/s down on my university connection.
<GreeningGalaxy>	but only 0.4 at home on a good day
<ceil>	: )
<zerowaitstate>	Silenced_v2: how familiar are you with operating systems in general?
<GreeningGalaxy>	quoth wikipedia: "In contrast to most modern Linux distributions, Slackware provides no graphical installation procedure and no automatic dependency resolution of software packages."
<GreeningGalaxy>	yike.
<triceratux>	neonrooster: slack is the longest continually maintained distro, one of the original bonafide dotcoms. it studiously avoided gnomewars, vimwars, & grubwars so by todays standards it seems somewhat sparse. its repo is a fraction the size of debian but it always has a spotlessly pristine toolchain so it can rely on source compiles called slackbuilds
<ceil>	slapt
<Silenced_v2>	zerowaitstate: I was a windows user few days ago . Just got into linux some 2 months ago
<Silenced_v2>	Got interested in kernel .So started working on it
<neonrooster>	triceratux, holy cow
<GreeningGalaxy>	I will probably be a Windows user soon.
<GreeningGalaxy>	again soon, that is
<GreeningGalaxy>	i've been exclusively linux for over a year now
<zerowaitstate>	Silenced_v2: I would start with the textbooks by Silberschatz or Tanenbaum before diving into Linux specific stuff
<zerowaitstate>	Silenced_v2: you need to understand core concepts before diving into the kernel or you'll drown
<Silenced_v2>	Actually i took that challenge to learn about kernel
<Silenced_v2>	I own that book by Silberschatz . Familiar with threads and process though
<zerowaitstate>	Silenced_v2: there is an Addison-Wesley book by Robert Love on Linux Kernel development
<Silenced_v2>	zerowaitstate: I dont have that . May be i should get that
<zerowaitstate>	Silenced_v2: it provides some background on _why_ things work the way they do, which is hard to discover just from reading the source
<Silenced_v2>	zerowaitstate: Okay
<Silenced_v2>	zerowaitstate: which irc client are u using ?
<zerowaitstate>	why?
<Silenced_v2>	zerowaitstate: Just asking
<zerowaitstate>	irssi
<Silenced_v2>	zerowaitstate: Heh ! me too :D
<metaspike>	hi everybody!
<GreeningGalaxy>	...this is odd
<metaspike>	having trouble recording monitor and analog at the same time, trying to use pulse exclusively - I miss JACK sometimes, but connecting all the ports etc was a pain, all I need is a solid "record everything I hear" switch, i guess this depends on alot of things...
<GreeningGalaxy>	Distrowatch says Slackware was made by Linus Torvalds in 1991. Wikipedia says Slackware was made by Patrick Volkerding in 1993.
<metaspike>	linus didn't make slackware :) lel
<GreeningGalaxy>	yeah, that sounded dubious to me
<metaspike>	of course, there would be no slackware without linus, but you get what i mean
<GreeningGalaxy>	yeah
<zorak8>	hi, im trying to update my linux mint with the update manager, but im getting an error
<zorak8>	W: An error occurred during the signature verification. The repository is not updated and the previous index files will be used. GPG error: http://deb.bitmask.net trusty InRelease: The following signatures were invalid: KEYEXPIRED ###############3
<zorak8>	any idea how to solve that?
<metaspike>	is that actually how the error comes up or did you nerf the key
<zorak8>	get the same error if try to do sudo aptitude update
<zorak8>	i nerf the key
<metaspike>	gpg --keyserver pgpkeys.mit.edu --recv-key SDSDSDSDSDSDD
<metaspike>	gpg -a --export SDSDSDSDSDSD | sudo apt-key add -
<metaspike>	where SDSDSDSD is your actual key
<Silenced_v2>	zerowaitstate: Which version of kernel are u currently using ?
<zorak8>	the actuall key i get from the error/
<zorak8>	?
<metaspike>	yes, the one you nerfed :)
<zerowaitstate>	Silenced_v2: one of the late 3.x's. I forget which
<zorak8>	i have 3, but the 3 are the same
<metaspike>	then one and three are the same also
*	metaspike mind blown
<GreeningGalaxy>	whats the difference between aptitude and apt-get?
*	AlphaTech is now known as zz_AlphaTech
<GreeningGalaxy>	oh huh. aptitude has a whole...whatever you call those terminal interfaces that look like GUIs.
<zorak8>	gpg: "#########" not a key ID: skipping
<zorak8>	didnt work
<triceratux>	GreeningGalaxy: aptitude is an ncurses app & apt-get is a cli program. both are frontends for dpkg iinm
<GreeningGalaxy>	ah
<GreeningGalaxy>	thanks
<zorak8>	GreeningGalaxy: im used to use aptitude, dont know whats really the diff, except maybe the purge and search options
<zorak8>	but im not sure
<GreeningGalaxy>	ive always used apt-get. when I used Arch, I got into having to search for packages, and now I use apt-cache search every time i turn around.
<zorak8>	arch not use yum?
<Psi-Jack>	heh. fun times. I think tomorrow I'm going to start calling and complaining directly to AT&T regarding their new lawsuits on the FCC.
<Loshki>	GreeningGalaxy: and you can usually go between them. Last time I researched it, the most significant difference between them was the claim that aptitude could resolve dependency issues better than apt-get. I've never had to test this.
<GreeningGalaxy>	hrm
<metaspike>	here you go zorak8, someone else has explained it so I don't have to :) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1139127/how-to-trust-a-apt-repository-debian-apt-get-update-error-public-key-is-not-av
<zorak8>	oh thanks!!
<metaspike>	the key of the key is to make sure you key is the right key for the key authority
<zorak8>	lol
<ryantrinkle>	is there a way to determine what executable execvp will run, without shelling out to 'which' or something like that?
<metaspike>	"shelling out" ? if you're not in shell, then what's the context?
<emma>	If you have some movies in one directory and you cp them to another directory on the same machine, does that reduce your total free diskspace?
<metaspike>	i've found which is a bit dumb sometimes, it only looks in certain directories for the binary
<Loshki>	ryantrinkle: I don't think so, which is why it's considered a security issue to not use full pathnames to your executables.
<ryantrinkle>	metaspike: well, all i mean is that i'd like the functionality of 'which', but just within my executable
<ryantrinkle>	Loshki: ah, ok
<Loshki>	ryantrinkle: that said, the search order of execvp is documented. You could duplicate it in your code...
<metaspike>	your executable bash script?
*	Aww is now known as PrincessAww
<metaspike>	location = $(which executable)
<Psi-Jack>	emma: Are you unable to think common sense?
<ryantrinkle>	metaspike: no, it's a binary (written in Haskell)
<metaspike>	Haslell? lol, i have no idea, maybe consult with the old man of the mountains
<ryantrinkle>	i was thinking of calling out to libc, but it doesn't expose this functionality
<ryantrinkle>	haha
<ryantrinkle>	well, i was trying to avoid writing this part in haskell ;)
<ryantrinkle>	but i couldn't find a reliable C version, either
<ryantrinkle>	anyway, it's simple enough to write it out
<gildedlink>	hi folks, i have a gcc question, would that be better suited here or is there a channel specifically for the make command and gcc?
<GreeningGalaxy>	gildedlink: uh, i guess wherever you can find people. :I
<GreeningGalaxy>	I barely know the first thing about make, so I don't think I'll be very helpful.
<gildedlink>	well you're in good company, i can't figure it out much either
<GreeningGalaxy>	I don't seem to recall actually succeeding in make'ing anything. I did try the other day, but it failed because the thing was old and I didn't feel like trying to downgrade the necessary package.
<GreeningGalaxy>	i found something else to do what I needed to do anyway.
<zerowaitstate>	gildedlink: my advice, if you are starting something new, is to use gnu autotools rather than creating makefiles yourself
<GreeningGalaxy>	good lord. xfce touch screen support has been borked since 2012
<GreeningGalaxy>	guess I can write off ever seeing a fix for that one. :I
<GreeningGalaxy>	well, not ever
<GreeningGalaxy>	but not soon, lol
<adsjlkdk>	guys is there some sort of package that lets you listen to youtube vids through tty
<diegoviola>	gnome is probably better on a touch screen than xfce
<GreeningGalaxy>	yeah, bug gnome is gnome
<GreeningGalaxy>	but*
<GreeningGalaxy>	bit of a freudian typo there. :I
<annihilannic>	Freudian slip?
*	GreeningGalaxy doesn't at all like the "less settings, bigger buttons" direction GNOME has been going.
<GreeningGalaxy>	i've been vacilliating between xfce and kde these days. neither is perfect, but they're close IMO.
<GreeningGalaxy>	both customizable. one slightly more than the other, at the expense of stability.
*	metaspike thinks of gnome as a resource to push gtk forward, nothing more.
<GreeningGalaxy>	i saw a couple articles about how GNOME has been "winning back disillusioned users" with version 3.14, but I tried it, and I am ultimately forced to conclude that I am still disillusioned.
<zerowaitstate>	GreeningGalaxy: re-dis-illusioned?
<GreeningGalaxy>	something like that.
<GreeningGalaxy>	GNOME was all I ever needed when I was using Debian 6, with version 2.whatever it was.
<GreeningGalaxy>	I think XFCE is the closest to that which currently exists.
<GreeningGalaxy>	right now I'm playing with XFCE and compton, which has basically made my desktop into "Just Like KDE Except For The KDE Part"
<GreeningGalaxy>	I'm even using a bunch of KDE apps, because I happen to like them.
<GreeningGalaxy>	I mean, I get my transparency blur fix and it doesn't crash, so I'm happy.
<diegoviola>	GreeningGalaxy: good, now go do some real work
<GreeningGalaxy>	diegoviola: I'm studying physics at uni during the week. does that count?
<codebam>	whats the file format for an rsa key that Im going to be using for ssh authentication?
<diegoviola>	GreeningGalaxy: sure
<[R]>	codebam: text?
<SpiceMan>	codebam: pem, usually.
<codebam>	[R]: well I generated keys, and copied them to my phone. but it says invalid format. so I need to add a file extention.
<codebam>	SpiceMan: trying that now :)
<[R]>	codebam: how did you generate them? what syas "invalid format"
<GreeningGalaxy>	Linux is my invasive hobby. I'm trying my level best to make it less of a timesink, but once you learn about all the different desktop environments, it gets really hard to settle down.
<codebam>	[R]: I did "ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -o -a 100" and juicessh is saying invalid format
<[R]>	sounds like juicessh is expecting something weird then
<SpiceMan>	codebam: what file are you copying to your phone?
<Psi-Jack>	codebam: JuiceSSH's author provides excellent and very fast support.
<zerowaitstate>	http://sonelli.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/139632-juicessh-supported-private-key-formats-openssh-pem-
<codebam>	SpiceMan: my private key from that command ^
<codebam>	Psi-Jack: I know. but I dont think it would be a good idea to bother him/her with such a basic question
<Psi-Jack>	codebam: Well, it's not exactly on-topic for ##linux, now is it?
<SpiceMan>	codebam: it should generate two files.
<GreeningGalaxy>	why does ##linux have two hashes?
<Psi-Jack>	Because.
<MetaNova>	GreeningGalaxy: unofficial
<codebam>	SpiceMan: yes, a private and public
<codebam>	Psi-Jack: well #openssh is dead...
<Psi-Jack>	codebam: It's neither a Linux issue nor an openssh issue, but a JuiceSSH issue.
<zerowaitstate>	codebam: the issue is JuiceSSH related, not openssh
<codebam>	okay. is there a juicessh channel...?
<zerowaitstate>	codebam: if you remove the -o option I think it would probably work
<codebam>	zerowaitstate: okay. I'll try
<SpiceMan>	codebam: drop the -o
<[R]>	drop it like it's hot
<zerowaitstate>	when will the bass drop?
<GreeningGalaxy>	not to be that person who says "don't use [your software], just use [whatever I use]", but I've had much better luck with connectbot than juicessh.
<codebam>	lol
<zerowaitstate>	www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCawU6BE8P8
<zerowaitstate>	zerowaitstate: sorry, ot
<GreeningGalaxy>	I never even figured out how to set up rsa keys on juice. It's pretty straightforward on connectbot.
<codebam>	that worked :)
<zerowaitstate>	codebam: you're welcome
<codebam>	yes thank you everyone :)
<codebam>	sorry for the off-topic...
<zerowaitstate>	GreeningGalaxy: I'm a JuiceSSH user. It's not hard. I like the terminal handling of Juice better
<GreeningGalaxy>	alright
<zerowaitstate>	I used Connectbot before I discovered Juice
<GreeningGalaxy>	interesting
<Psi-Jack>	codebam: Now, contact the JuiceSSH developer to tell him to update his stuff to support the new SSH protocol 2 key format.
<zerowaitstate>	i use terminal multiplexers a lot (tmux/byobu) and they're easier to manage with Juice
<GreeningGalaxy>	I don't get along with Android UIs very well, so the fact that Connectbot has fewer graphical buttons is a plus for me on its own.
<codebam>	Psi-Jack: lol okay :p
<codebam>	juicessh supports the most cryptos of any app Ive used though
<GreeningGalaxy>	i mainly just use ssh on my phone to manage my irc bot when I'm away from my laptop. Or make my laptop shout "Hey! I'm locked out!" at my roommate.
<codebam>	lol
*	SpiceMan plugs earphones into GreeningGalaxy's laptop
<GreeningGalaxy>	I usually keep it plugged into speakers.
<GreeningGalaxy>	so I just have to pop into alsamixer, make sure the headphone volume is as high as it goes, then espeak away.
*	SpiceMan gives GreeningGalaxy a cat to gnaw his speakers' cables
<GreeningGalaxy>	ive notably only done that once
<GreeningGalaxy>	also i'm a she, btw. :p
<SpiceMan>	whatever. CAT WINS
<GreeningGalaxy>	I think cats are banned in my dorm, so that would end badly.
<GreeningGalaxy>	theres one building on campus that allows cats, and I don't live in it.
<[R]>	GreeningGalaxy: sounds like you should move
<SpiceMan>	C.A.T. W.I.N.S.
<GreeningGalaxy>	I don't really get along with cats very well anyway.
<GreeningGalaxy>	no particular notions against them, they just don't like me because they can smell the dog on me.
<[R]>	no, they can sense you hate them
<[R]>	and are acting in kind
<GreeningGalaxy>	I don't hate them. they're fuzzy and have large eyes, it's practically impossible to hate them unless you have allergy issues or bad past experiences.
<GreeningGalaxy>	since I have neither, I'm pretty okay with cats.
<[R]>	cats are superior to dogs
<GreeningGalaxy>	eh, now that I'm not so sure about. dogs have their selling points.
<SpiceMan>	human pet > *
<[R]>	SpiceMan: i think that's called a slave...
<SpiceMan>	depends on the type of contract
<[R]>	GreeningGalaxy: smelly and barky
<gildedlink>	just drop food every now and then around them and walk away so they can feel safe coming up to eat it
<gildedlink>	they'll warm up quickly to that
<gildedlink>	cats are highly utilitarian.  prove you're useful to them and they'll reciprocate.  that's the kind of social they are
<GreeningGalaxy>	my family's never owned cats, mainly because my dad's allergic to them, my mom doesn't like it when they eat birds, and all of us agree that the smell of sick cat pee is less nice than the smell of sick dog pee, especially since the latter happens less frequently and mainly outside.
<[R]>	they are so smart, they domesticated themselves
<GreeningGalaxy>	debating the relative intelligence of dogs and cats is ultimately kind of useless.
<LMNOP__>	i dunno a border collie is a fuckload more smarter than any cat ive seen
<GreeningGalaxy>	I agree that it's pretty easy to see that cats tend to know what's going on. Dogs have also proven themselves capable of detecting drugs, lending an eye to blind people, etc
<ceil>	i bet most cats know that "more smarter" is Bad English
<LMNOP__>	nazi
<GreeningGalaxy>	herding sheep, comforting the sick, taking down criminals...
<[R]>	i've heard stories of cats tehre were hundreds of miles away from home, and they manage to get back
<[R]>	GreeningGalaxy: a cat could sniff out drugs, they just don't give a f
<GreeningGalaxy>	[citation needed]
<[R]>	GreeningGalaxy: theere was the cat in the nursing home, who would curl up next to someone who was about to die
<GreeningGalaxy>	arguably, giving an f is a necessary element to drug-sniffing ability.
<[R]>	http://www.thelocal.fr/20141215/cat-reunited-with-owner-after-1200-km-journey-across-france
<ceil>	[R]: cats ain't snitches
<[R]>	it can, it chooses not to
<[R]>	ceil: haha
<GreeningGalaxy>	like i said, I'm not saying that arguments for [cats/dogs] being nice are invalid, mostly just that arguments against [cats/dogs] being nice generally aren't
<GreeningGalaxy>	valid, that is
<Swifftynob>	what does USR1 do in a killall -s?
<ceil>	depends on your interpretation of 'nice'
<Swifftynob>	i cant find it on google
<GreeningGalaxy>	ceil: well, yes.
<ceil>	i don't think barking at everything that moves within fifty feet of you is very nice
<ceil>	or even the 'friendlier' actions of crotch-sniffing and face-licking
<[R]>	Swifftynob: it sends USR1
<GreeningGalaxy>	that all depends on the dog.
<ceil>	dogs annoy me to no end, unless they're acting like cats : p
<Swifftynob>	what does USR1 mean?
<GreeningGalaxy>	just as many of my issues with cats depend on the cat.
<Swifftynob>	or do?
<[R]>	ceil: my cat kneeds me in my lower regions
<ceil>	cat kneading feels awesome, though : p
<[R]>	Swifftynob: it means usr1
<SpiceMan>	Swifftynob: the process handles USR1 however it sees fit.
<ceil>	dem tingly claws
<[R]>	Swifftynob: the program will define what it does
<Swifftynob>	so it's upto the pro..
<Swifftynob>	oh cool
<GreeningGalaxy>	We had a dog that barked that everything that moved within sight of it, including us. I'm not saying that that wasn't pure agony.
<Swifftynob>	makes sense
<GreeningGalaxy>	anyway, cat/dog debates, meta-debates, meta-meta-debates, and harumphing at the excessiveness of metafication are all pretty futile.
<naphtha>	true, we might as well try to prove evolution while we're at it. =P
<LMNOP__>	i like it when cats jump on you when your asleep
<annihilannic>	you're
<LMNOP__>	or that annoying humpy-ass rubbing on leg thing
<naphtha>	annihilannic: thank you. =)
<LMNOP__>	hitler
<naphtha>	c'mon, it's your only language.
<GreeningGalaxy>	just four that, Im going to start useing wrong grammer intentionally.
<naphtha>	true, i had my cat run over my face. i woke up ready to fight something, but, the cat is there looking at me.
<SpiceMan>	*you're </ice-cone-in-forehead>
<naphtha>	GreeningGalaxy: at least you know, though.
<annihilannic>	naphtha: "fight me.", it said.
*	metaspike looks for linux related issues, finds a discussion about cats and meta discussion
<metaspike>	must be friday
<naphtha>	metaspike: often, people chat about random things until somebody asks a question.
<GreeningGalaxy>	There's times when you'll really  want to make sure your grammar is clear, so there isn't any ambiguity in reading it. IRC is generally not one of those times.
<naphtha>	GreeningGalaxy: it's for yourself, though, not other people.
<naphtha>	how do you want people to see you? any pride, or, self-worth? =)
<GreeningGalaxy>	sure, but it always kinda bugs me when people jump to fix each other's grammar. does it really matter that much if you understood what they meant?
<annihilannic>	GreeningGalaxy: Did you mean "There are..."  *ducks and runs*
<LMNOP__>	last time i checked i was liveing in a free county
<naphtha>	GreeningGalaxy: well, they are doing you a favor by helping you, but, you'd rather become offended? that doesn't make sense.
<metaspike>	maybe if ontopic posts where prepended with something I could tell the messages apart
<naphtha>	LMNOP__: America has more laws than most other countries. kind of ironic that we need so many laws for that "freedom"
<GreeningGalaxy>	whee, headlong into politics
<annihilannic>	One of my favourite T-shirt slogans: Grammar - the difference between knowing your shit, and knowing you're shit.
<GreeningGalaxy>	haha
<GreeningGalaxy>	judging people's intelligence based on their moment-to-moment command of grammar is a lovely way to pass your time, huh?
<GreeningGalaxy>	:I
<naphtha>	another example is the comma. the comma is the difference between, "Bill helped his uncle jack off a horse" ....or.... "Bill helped his uncle, jack, off a horse"
<LMNOP__>	well you dont like this coutry your free to leave it now
<naphtha>	you're* =)
<GreeningGalaxy>	no I'm not.
<naphtha>	just stick with UR if you can't figure it out. lol.
<LMNOP__>	arghh
<naphtha>	works for both.
<[R]>	naphtha: there's one about eating grandma
<naphtha>	[R]: i probably shouldn't have even mentioned that. =P
<metaspike>	random, all so very random
<naphtha>	i walked out of an ENG102 class because the teacher passed out worksheets on: their, there, and they're. another worksheet on: your and you're
<naphtha>	now, this is ENG102, not ENG101, mind you.
<naphtha>	of course, that was back when college classes were $100/ea
<metaspike>	good mastery of ones native language is an important attribute for any programmer
<ceil>	rather than $100/day? :<

<ceil>	GroonongGoloxo: ond whot tho fock wos hos problom?
<ceil>	: )
<metaspike>	not a bad quote i think, hmmm
<naphtha>	today i saw another site, akin to whatismyip.com only it was canihasip.com
<SporkWitch>	naphtha: i've actually read a couple interesting articles on the idea of text speech as a spoken language, in written form.  it's an interesting point: it's the first written language that's actually used like a spoken language, and it's shown the same forms of evolution
<GreeningGalaxy>	he has a lot of problems. generally bad predisposition towards bots is one of them.
<naphtha>	or wait, it was canihazip.com
<SporkWitch>	naphtha: when you conside rthings like outrageous fees for text messages, and very limited message size, some of the abbreviations make a lot of sense
<GreeningGalaxy>	lol yeah
<ceil>	SporkWitch: and then you realise that it's no longer 1995
<GreeningGalaxy>	i never used them at all until I got a phone with 250 texts per quarter.
<naphtha>	SporkWitch: it'll become the new language of the lower class, close to eubonics and pahtwah =)
<SporkWitch>	ceil: many of the points still stand, though.  even with things like swiftkey, some shortcuts still make sense in order to hold a real-time conversation
<ceil>	i've never texted like that, in in the 20th century
<ceil>	i even used punctuation in my texts : )
<metaspike>	hahaha, abbreviations are counter-intelligence generation Y bs, their variables will be called things only they can comprehend
<SporkWitch>	nor i, but i also never really did the text thing either
<naphtha>	ceil: same.
<metaspike>	abbreviations / txt-speak etc.
<SporkWitch>	metaspike: hardly, and if you think that you won't last long in computing, we love our acronyms too lol
<naphtha>	it's nice that we have that voice-to-text now. technology can cure ignorance. =)
<SpiceMan>	lots of abbreviations predate computers
<ceil>	metaspike: surely they're writing well-commented code, though :o
<GreeningGalaxy>	"the language of the lower class?" theres so much wrong with that. >_>
<ceil>	iLikeDescriptiveVariableNamesInCamelCase;
<naphtha>	ceil: they even comment their psuedo code, right? =)
<SporkWitch>	naphtha: i've actually seen more issues with that than trying to use t9 word lol
<naphtha>	oh man, i hate t9.
<metaspike>	god, i hope so.. lulz = (hamburger + thingybob)
<SpiceMan>	ceil: i_hate_them :p
<naphtha>	SporkWitch: well, people have to be able to speak the language, too. heh. there-in lies the problem with the failure in it.
<neonrooster>	wow Slackware is the BEST linux I've ever tried!
<naphtha>	seriously. half the nation speaks spanish, the other speaks kiddie-copter-banana, now.
<naphtha>	neonrooster: here here!
<ceil>	kiddie... copter... ... ...banana?
<neonrooster>	any way to get up to date kernels in the install phase though?
<naphtha>	ceil: can i has cheeseburger?
<neonrooster>	and up to date software?
<SporkWitch>	naphtha: if you're outside of it for a while, i agree.  took a while before i bothered looking out wth people meant when they said "smh" (turns out, they mean "i'm too stupid to actually have something useful to say, so i'm going to be condescending instead"; or as they say on tumblr, "shaking my head")
<SporkWitch>	s/out/up/
<ceil>	gods, i hope i never actually hear people speaking like that in a serious manner
<SpiceMan>	neonrooster: net install
<neonrooster>	I _need_ up to date installation kernels because my USB flash drive doesn't work under the old kernel on my laptop
*	GreeningGalaxy smh
<neonrooster>	SpiceMan: wifi only I can't
<ceil>	lol
<neonrooster>	there's no ethernet port on my laptop
<SpiceMan>	plug a cable.
<SporkWitch>	ceil: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzpSREpLJY8 too late
<ceil>	that's why god invented soldering irons
<naphtha>	SporkWitch: that translation sounds like what a highly-educated person felt it meant, and, not what the speaker probably was thinking. speaker was probably thinking. "i dun give a damn"
<neonrooster>	it's a dell laptop grr
<GreeningGalaxy>	suffice to say i'm unimpressed with your classism. but I'm pretty much halfway out of here already anyway
<neonrooster>	ceil: then I'm no pastor
<naphtha>	neonrooster: no ethernet on laptop? might find an ethernet USB dongle.
<neonrooster>	I can't use soldering irons to speak the word of god
<neonrooster>	naphtha: that wouldn't work with EFI
<SporkWitch>	GreeningGalaxy: tschuess!
<naphtha>	neonrooster: as for the updated kernel question, unless you're good with kernel building, you may be forced to stick with the kernel included with slackware. maybe somebody else here knows differently?
<neonrooster>	naphtha: I'm bad at kernel building
<neonrooster>	never done it before; am willing to learn
<neonrooster>	I hear you use make defconfig blah blah blah
<GreeningGalaxy>	yeah, not really the right tool for the job. To speak the word of god, you probably want a megaphone, or a suitably powerful radio transmitter. Soldering irons may be useful for coercing others to speak the word for you, but are of limited use when it comes to actually producing the word directly.
<ceil>	lol lolcode
<neonrooster>	ceil: where?
<SpiceMan>	neonrooster: anyway, what's wrong with your wifi that you can't net install?
<neonrooster>	SpiceMan: because the BIOS won't boot from the network over WiFi
<SporkWitch>	GreeningGalaxy: cat /vmlinuz > /dev/audio
<SporkWitch>	GreeningGalaxy: THAT is the voice of got
<SporkWitch>	*god
<GreeningGalaxy>	heh
<ceil>	lol
*	GreeningGalaxy prefers | aplay
<SpiceMan>	neonrooster: uh? I said net install, not net boot
<neonrooster>	Oh
<SporkWitch>	GreeningGalaxy: get off my lawn, you young whippersnapper
<naphtha>	SporkWitch: cat /dev/random > /dev/audio  ...unless you're saying Linux is God? =)
<SpiceMan>	neonrooster: eg: https://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst
<GreeningGalaxy>	/dev/random is a hash of the voice of god. Cracking it is computationally expensive; more so than the average consumer system can handle.

<Cylinda>	Anyone know how to remove the top and bottom bar from Point linux?
<GreeningGalaxy>	that's to say nothing of NSA datacenters, though.
<neonrooster>	SpiceMan: well I can't netinstall slackware cause it detects no wifi card
<baldrick>	help: looking for linux drivers for Lexmark X85 all in one printer/scanner
<baldrick>	google search is failing me
<SpiceMan>	neonrooster: then you shouldn't use slackware :P
<neonrooster>	SpiceMan: NUU I love Slackware!
<neonrooster>	I will do anything to get a recent kernel in a custom ISO!
<neonrooster>	even if it means learning how to make a custom ISO.
<SpiceMan>	configuring iwconfig before running the setup program would be the slackware way.
<neonrooster>	SpiceMan: no ifconfig -a actually doesn't show the wifi card
<SpiceMan>	because you use iwconfig for wireless interfaces

<Encapsulation>	how can I send an email to myself from the command line?
<GreeningGalaxy>	Encapsulation: mail command?
<GreeningGalaxy>	try man mail
<Encapsulation>	does it need special setup?
<Encapsulation>	or do I just install mail
<GreeningGalaxy>	not much, if any
<GreeningGalaxy>	yeah, just install mail if it isn't already installed
<Encapsulation>	can it send a file
<GreeningGalaxy>	should be able to.
<GreeningGalaxy>	I seem to remember it being pretty easy after I got all the arguments sorted out.
<GreeningGalaxy>	I set up my raspberry pi to email me the contents of ifconfig whenever it boots up, just so I can plug it in wherever and know which address to ssh to without having to hook it to a monitor.
<neonrooster>	is overclocking for the peanut gallery?
<Loshki>	Encapsulation: by 'myself' do you mean purely local mail, or to your gmail account or some such?
<tuor>	hi, when i create a luks volume, I should override the volume first (random/zero depending on the volume). If I don't, is the "new" data in the luks volume in danger? Or is only the "old" data from the old file system still readable with the right methods?
<Encapsulation>	to gmail or something
<Encapsulation>	or to 2341252525@vtext.com
<Encapsulation>	etc
<Encapsulation>	Loshki,
<Loshki>	Encapsulation: then you need a backend mailer, e.g. postfix, ssmtp, sendmail, something like that. What distro are you running?
<Encapsulation>	Loshki, debian
<Encapsulation>	Loshki, I'd like to call this from my c++ code and have it send a file I've created
<Cylinda>	Anyone familiar with Archbang?
<neonrooster>	GreeningGalaxy: how's this for a security vuln? the system administrator logs in as root, and then he leaves the root console on another tty open for all to see _after_ you hit Ctrl+Alt+F2
<metaspike>	SporkWitch, great presentation sadlt http://lolcode.com/ 404 man, what a gutter
<neonrooster>	then the attacker does passwd as the root user and changes it
<GreeningGalaxy>	neonrooster: :I
<SporkWitch>	metaspike: that's what happens when you go to the wrong site: http://lolcode.org/
<Encapsulation>	Loshki, I meant to say raspbian
<metaspike>	thanks :) looks like we are plugging lolcode.org todeay
<SporkWitch>	metaspike: i was talking about it earlier, but only because the conversation about textspeak made me think of it lol
<neonrooster>	GreeningGalaxy: I locked myself out so I did that
<SporkWitch>	metaspike: i actually found a video that's a legit intro to programming tutorial, done in lolcode lol
<neonrooster>	but I'm the computer's owner and nobody is here
<Encapsulation>	why would I ever use exim4 vs ssmtp
<GreeningGalaxy>	Cylinda: I've used regular Arch before, but don't know anything about Archbang or what its similarities/differences are, so...
<metaspike>	Encapsulation, i've had success with sendmail
<SporkWitch>	metaspike: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkmJcgbXkJA

<bullgard4>	I have freshly set up Debian 8.  After transporting the T43 laptop computer to a Linux user group my uxterm windows show black letters on a white background. I have copied ~/.Xresources from another Debian-8 computer where white letters appear on a black background. How to revert the black/white appearance of my uxterm windows?
<SporkWitch>	metaspike: welcome to my world. i've been using this name for nearly two decades, ever since Path of Exile come out all the search results are for that game, instead of me
<metaspike>	bullgard4, what if you have no ~/.Xresources at all?
<ayecee>	bullgard4: did you have any custom settings in ~/.Xresources? you could maybe move it to another filename and logout/login to see if that resolves it.
<GreeningGalaxy>	bullgard4: is there not just a gui way to change that?
<metaspike>	also ~/.bash_profile
<GreeningGalaxy>	yeah that
<bullgard4>	metaspike: Then I have black letters on a white background.
<metaspike>	right, which is default
<SporkWitch>	metaspike: he needs to change his terminal emulator's settings
<neonrooster>	GreeningGalaxy: how do I test if my kernel should boot using qemu?
<GreeningGalaxy>	um, no idea.
<GreeningGalaxy>	sorry, that ones over my head.
<metaspike>	neonrooster, try and boot it using qemu? :)
<neonrooster>	metaspike: but how?
<neonrooster>	the problem is how do I install qemu?
<metaspike>	distro?
<SporkWitch>	neonrooster: http://google.com/
<neonrooster>	metaspike: slackware
<metaspike>	qemu has a gui and everything, it's not that hard.
<SporkWitch>	metaspike: no official one, but there are numerous ones available for it
<metaspike>	more native than virtualbox or whatever so I commend you for using qemu
<bullgard4>	ayecee: I do hav custom settings in ~/.Xresources. I already did what you suggest: move it to another filename and logout/login. I still have black letters on a white background.
<ayecee>	i see
<SporkWitch>	bullgard4: because you need to change the settings in the terminal emulator itself
<metaspike>	neonrooster, slapt-get install qmenu?
<SporkWitch>	oh look, and a million hits for "change uxterm color"
<metaspike>	slapt-get install qemu
<neonrooster>	metaspike: how do I get slapt-get?
<Loshki>	Encapsulation: gonna have to ask the raspbian guys I think. ssmtp is small and simple to configure, sendmail and postfix are sledgehammers cracking nuts in comparison.
<metaspike>	open a terminal, type in "su -", enter root password, then type "slapt-get install qemu"
<neonrooster>	-su: slapt-get: command not found
<Encapsulation>	small and simple is what i need
<SporkWitch>	bullgard4: http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/90608/xterm-not-loading-color-schemes
<Cylinda>	Is there any way to completely remove the top bar from Debian? (Point linux) Also the bottom one if possible.
<Cylinda>	(Not hide)
<bullgard4>	metaspike: A file ~/.bash_profile does not exist.
<neonrooster>	metaspike: I'm compiling qemu now
<metaspike>	bullgard4, not sure why I dislike linking this site but http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/bash-shell-change-the-color-of-my-shell-prompt-under-linux-or-unix/ should do
<GreeningGalaxy>	Cylinda: what desktop environment?
<metaspike>	bash prompts which inherit from the native bash coloring scheme will use this method
<Loshki>	Encapsulation: ssmtp has one downside. If you lose contact with the server, it loses email.
<metaspike>	xterm
<Cylinda>	GreeningGalaxy, MATe
<Cylinda>	MATE
<GreeningGalaxy>	hmm
<Cylinda>	Or any other, I will be reinstalling another distro soon.
<GreeningGalaxy>	I have yet to use MATE. but it's a fork of GNOME 2.something, right?
<metaspike>	yeah, mate is great.
<GreeningGalaxy>	oh, well, you shouldn't have much trouble with that in XFCE or something.
<neonrooster>	metaspike GreeningGalaxy : whoa OS 9 on QEMU! http://www.emaculation.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7047
<Cylinda>	Note I'm not looking for a hide but a remove.
<GreeningGalaxy>	yeah, XFCE would have that.
<Cylinda>	Ok great.
<GreeningGalaxy>	as in "panel is not there, does not appear when moused over, but can be restored later if desired"
<metaspike>	neonrooster, awesome, but also... why?!!
<neonrooster>	metaspike: because I'm assuming that we are bored
<metaspike>	ah
<GreeningGalaxy>	can confirm, XFCE has "remove panel" option.
<neonrooster>	I can get a System 9 CD from my sister
<Encapsulation>	Loshki, I just need to send an email
<GreeningGalaxy>	I haven't tested it directly because I want to keep my panels, but I see no reason why it would not work.
<neonrooster>	also, what does MIPS stand for? does it stand for Parallel System?
<GreeningGalaxy>	neonrooster: I think you may have the wrong gal. I don't even know what QEMU is.
<ayecee>	microprocessor without interlocked pipeline stages, apparently.
<ayecee>	is MIPS
<vodkode>	sup pplz
<neonrooster>	GreeningGalaxy: are you an astronomer?
<GreeningGalaxy>	no, not really
<GreeningGalaxy>	i love all things space, but I'm just a freshman undergrad student at the moment.
<vodkode>	I did not know it but recently learned that in space the sun/stars are invisible
<GreeningGalaxy>	wut?
<vodkode>	you cannot see light itself and without an ionosphere/etc to act as a filter its invisible essentially
<GreeningGalaxy>	not true.
<neonrooster>	but GreeningGalaxy, I love all things computers
<GreeningGalaxy>	stars emit lots of visible light. if scatter from the ionosphere/ozone were all you could see, you wouldn't be able to see discreet points/disks of light
<DLange>	you'd be blind looking at a Sun but you'd see something
<neonrooster>	but I am not learning how to make code yet
<DLange>	and if you were to close, you'd burn as well
<vodkode>	GreeningGalaxy thats what I thought as well, however its a fact, I looked into it, sun cannot even be seen
<vodkode>	if you stare at it, you would go blind, but without actually seeing it
<GreeningGalaxy>	[citation needed]
<vodkode>	light is not something visible, you cannot see a beam of a laser for example
<GreeningGalaxy>	you don't have to look at the sun directly to see it, anyway.
<GreeningGalaxy>	now you're just being pedantic.
<vodkode>	you see when it hits something, but not the beam itself
<DLange>	that's a completely different thing
<GreeningGalaxy>	you can see where light is by the backscatter which hits your retinas.
<metaspike>	:)
<metaspike>	grass is actually red
<GreeningGalaxy>	no, you can't see light that doesnt hit your retinas, that's not how seeing works.
<GreeningGalaxy>	you can see light that does hit your retinas, though, and from that extrapolate where other light is.
<metaspike>	because red is the color that absorbs every lightwave, except green
<GreeningGalaxy>	wut
<GreeningGalaxy>	how does that make it "actually" red
<metaspike>	it's red, except what you see is green
<GreeningGalaxy>	you'd be right (ish) to say that color isn't objective, but the established convention is that color=reflection spectrum.
<GreeningGalaxy>	not absorption spectrum.
<metaspike>	from the perspective of reality, it's read
<metaspike>	red*
<GreeningGalaxy>	what does that even mean, "from the perspective of reality"?
<GreeningGalaxy>	what, from the perspective of god?
<ayecee>	it means he disagrees and can't change his mind
<GreeningGalaxy>	shrug.
<GreeningGalaxy>	inb4 'pink is not a real color'
<ceil>	>implying god is reality
<baldrick>	question: recommend hypervisor for use on ubuntu 14.04 desktop - vms will be poc light loads
*	metaspike can't stop laughing
<ayecee>	that's more of a request than a question
<DLange>	baldrick: virtualbox, has a nice GUI
<DLange>	and baldrick, that's a cunning plan!
<GreeningGalaxy>	i'm not religious, I'm just wondering how you can suppose that reality has a perspective of its own.
<baldrick>	DLange : )
<porjo>	running vmstat I'm seeing quite a bit under 'si' (swap in) but consistently zero under 'so' (swap out). Is it normal to only have swap in with no swap out!?
<metaspike>	baldrick, i defer to qemu, virtualbox is more portable though... just make sure you have virt-x support for your cpu
<ayecee>	porjo: it's not hard to imagine a case where that happens.
<metaspike>	virtualbox is easier too
<metaspike>	but still, i don't like it, prop code and a bit cludgey
<baldrick>	metaspike Dlange thanks - heaviest load will be a WinXP for all those appies that demand windows
<ayecee>	porjo: for pages that were loaded from swap, they don't have to be written out to swap again if they haven't changed.
<baldrick>	so perhaps a more precise question is which is most tolerable running WinXP ignoring picky apps
<GreeningGalaxy>	well, thats all for me tonight, i'm exhausted.
<DLange>	baldrick: any virtualiser will do, just virtualbox will be easy to configure and manage. The others a bit more work to setup but then work the same.
<baldrick>	thanks
<sauvin>	I can also vote for VBox.
<baldrick>	im spoile dby vm workstation and fusion on other boxen, but i want i dont do expiermentation much onthose
<porjo>	ayecee, ah ok - I had it round the other way i.e. thinking swap out meant 'coming out of swap, into ram'
<Haris>	hello all
<Haris>	on 6.x, I'v tried increasing limits in /etc/security/limits.conf and limits.d/bla-bla-bla-file, yet when I restart lighttpd, and check the number of files its process can open, its still the same i.e., 3k files. I remember I was told to modify systemd config file for a service for centos 7.x, which made the difference. it was not working through limits.conf file at that time as well. I'v checked the box I need
<Haris>	 to optimize tcp stack on. it has 8 GB RAM. so the OS has already configured /proc/sys/fs/file-max to 798097, which is a good enough number for open files for any given process on this box. how can I enforce a value larger than 3k open files for lighttpd on this box
<metaspike>	good lord
<Haris>	?
<baldrick>	vbox is the winner then - thanks
<baldrick>	this box 64 bit so goodness
<Haris>	this is not spam. I'm told to put all of my words in one line, rather than press enter every now and then with less number of words spanning over multiple lines
<sauvin>	Haris, and as a matter of fact, I see nothing wrong with what you asked, or how you asked it.
<jeffrey3234>	Can anyone RDP to Windows 10 from linux? If so what are you using
<metaspike>	Haris, 'the number of files the process can open' not the number of connections etc? just wondering if this can be handled from lighthttp's own conifg
<Haris>	metaspike, I need both. but yes, I was asking about num of open files
<Haris>	I'm running python based web app through lighttpd
<metaspike>	jeffrey3234, rdesktop
<metaspike>	Haris, not sure of how to handle the OS context, but lighthttpd's own config has server.max-fds, http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/wiki/Server_max-fdsDetails , which might be a block to your objective
<jeffrey3234>	metaspike can you confirm it works? Im running 1.7.1 and getting ERROR: recv: Connection reset by peer
<Haris>	is server.max-fds on per vhost basis or is it a global variable
<Haris>	variable=setting
<Haris>	yep! you nailed it. lighttpd has limit set for server.max-fds to 3k :@
<Haris>	I hate it when that happens. trivial things causing me immense pain in production
<jeffrey3234>	metaspike nm, compiled latest version, its working now, thanks!
<chinya>	ghbdtn
<chinya>	прив
<Haris>	does kernel 3.x have "significant" improvement over 2.6.x for tcp or performance ?
<Haris>	improvement(s)
<chinya>	I can't enter Google and a mai
<Haris>	for lighttpd, the docs page says --> max-connections == max-fds/2 (maybe /3). I'v set fds to 30k. that should auto-set maxconnections to 10k ?
<chinya>	I can't enter Google and a mai
<totesmuhgoats>	hmm, can't seem to figure out how to get xfce4-terminal to ignore my ctrl+pgup/pgdn so i can use tabs in vim
<totesmuhgoats>	it's very annoying
<grepper>	ctrl-pgup just sends  ;5~ to the terminal for me
<totesmuhgoats>	hmm
<totesmuhgoats>	works fine in xterm
<totesmuhgoats>	grepper: i believe that's what it should do
<grepper>	oh
<Taywee>	I'm having a weird issue with sed that I've never seen before, where [A-Z] character ranges are case insensitive unless run from a clean environment.
<Taywee>	http://paste.linuxassist.net/view/5ec033a1
<Taywee>	I have no idea what could be causing this.  I wasn't even aware that sed could be affected by the environment in this way.
<Taywee>	This is with GNU sed, by the way.
<SpiceMan>	what version is that?
<Taywee>	4.2.1.
<Taywee>	I just figured it out.
<SpiceMan>	and what's in your env?
<Taywee>	My locale was doing it.
<SpiceMan>	ah
<totesmuhgoats>	found what i was looking for
<Taywee>	Not sure why, it's just en_US.utf8 everywhere, except LC_TIME is en_DK.utf8
<totesmuhgoats>	now all is well in my life
<totesmuhgoats>	for a while
<SpiceMan>	lol
<Taywee>	Setting LC_ALL=C fixed it somehow.
<Taywee>	It was LC_COLLATE, great.
<grepper>	totesmuhgoats: how did you do it ?
<[spoiler]>	Does anyone know of the top of their head how much overhead there is when using `ssh user@server` and then executing a commmand through the shell prompt, versus doing `ssh user@server command`? I'm merely curious, and figured the folk here might know
<deego>	this folk doesn't :(
<jack_rabbit>	[spoiler], both are about equivalent.
<jack_rabbit>	[spoiler], obviously, you could implement a ssh server however you wanted, but in the typical case, they're equivalent.
<Taywee>	Pretty sure it's just the same overhead as invoking a login shell vs just invoking a shell.
<jack_rabbit>	[spoiler], In the latter case, you might avoid the overhead of loading a shell, but that's really small.
<Taywee>	Pretty sure it loads the shell anyway.  You can use shell features.  I think the only difference is that it doesn't source the profile and such when you specify the command on the command line.
<jack_rabbit>	Taywee, maybe, but I'm not sure about that.
<[spoiler]>	Hmm, thanks. A colleague and I had a discussion lol. He claimed doing `ssh ... command` is usually better than logging in and executing the command when the server is under high load. I claimed it's maybe a little better than doing `ssh ...` and then typing in the command without waiting for the prompt. it'd be buffered in either case (I think).
<Taywee>	"ssh localhost 'a=5; echo $a'" works just fine.
<[spoiler]>	jack_rabbit, Taywee: the shell is loaded, yeah
<[spoiler]>	In both cases
<jack_rabbit>	In that case, there's no difference.
<jack_rabbit>	Except the time it takes to type the command :)
<[spoiler]>	Haha
<Taywee>	If you're looking to save cycles, I doubt there is much of a difference here.  Just whichever is more convenient.
<[spoiler]>	I press eneter right after the hostname, probably muscle memory
<[spoiler]>	enter*
<[spoiler]>	Thanks, guys! :-)

<penos>	how to search for websites using javascript from google?
<metaspike>	damn steam games that dont recognise a 64bit inode system
<metaspike>	penos, why bother? google has an api
<metaspike>	i guess you could use that api with javascript
<metaspike>	assuming you had a way to parse the json, anyway OT
<AppAraat>	hello, I was wondering a (CLI) application which I could use for memo notes. For example, sometimes I use handy key commands for vim or some flags, but most of the time I have trouble memorizing them. I remember this website which let you create little notes which you would check from time to time and it also tracked how many times you saw a note. This way it could tell you which bits of information you had
<AppAraat>	trouble with etc.
<RayTracer>	AppAraat: maybe http://benjamin-schweizer.de/wiked.html is something for you
<RayTracer>	oh, it seems the download page is broken :/
<AppAraat>	a wiki writing tool for vim? Interesting, not sure if this is like a memo-note but I'll check it out
<AppAraat>	yeah he should have hosted it on github or something
<oo_miguel>	I want to buy a usb to rs232 "adapter". Do I have to take anything into account, so it will work under linux?
<RayTracer>	AppAraat: still available at http://linux.softpedia.com/get/Text-Editing-Processing/Others/WikEd-22939.shtml#download
<AppAraat>	cool, thanks :)
<leeyaa>	hello
<leeyaa>	i have an init.d script that is used to control a nodejs application. what do you guys think is a better approach to detect if port used by the nodejs application is taken or free - application itself should detect that and report it or init.d script should handled it?
<leeyaa>	i prefer if the init.d script has no idea what port the application is using
<leeyaa>	and also where should it print any errors - log file, or stderr ?
<peetaur2>	leeyaa: normally an init script doesn't care about the port, only the pid
<leeyaa>	peetaur2: so that means the application itself should take care of port - detect if it is free or not ?
<leeyaa>	is there any standard for that ? like something i can quote ?
<peetaur2>	leeyaa: the standard I have observed ;) is to just fail noisily saying cannot bind, address already in use or something like that.
<peetaur2>	leeyaa: and logging should be done to the syslog facility, such as by using the "logger" command
<leeyaa>	peetaur2: the app has its own error log, maybe it is a better idea to log there ? just like apache and nginx (although apache logs to stderr as well)
<peetaur2>	logging by the application that is... the init script itself may print some to stderr/out, but it should be very small output for a successful run of any init script
<leeyaa>	i was hoping that there is some official standard about that ;p
<AppAraat>	RayTracer: check this out - https://github.com/cwoac/nvim
<AppAraat>	but still it doesn't have usage statistics on which notes you search for and check
<leeyaa>	peetaur2: how would the initd script detect if application is up, check the pid file ?
<leeyaa>	and who should create the pid file - application or init.d ?
<peetaur2>	leeyaa: I trust the init/rc system more than the application to write the pid... but many processes make their own
<peetaur2>	when I write an init script based on one that lets the app do it, it works fine when I change it to make its own pid (usually is the solution to whatever problem caused me to rewrite the init script)
<peetaur2>	works fine when I change from making its own to start-stop-daemon making it I mean in the init script
<leeyaa>	i see
<peetaur2>	the only advantage I can see to an app making its own is if it spawns more processes and the parent is gone so the pid file would be stale
<leeyaa>	not that easy to make a decision rofl
<leeyaa>	we need standards :D
<peetaur2>	just make start-stop-daemon make the pid at /var/run/${initscriptname}.pid unless it doesn't work, then revert to other methods
<peetaur2>	there are standards, just not strictly defined ones ;)
<leeyaa>	peetaur2: in my case this didnt work as the app is started from a regular user
<leeyaa>	and it could not create a pid file at /var/run
<leeyaa>	so i used /tmp instead
<peetaur2>	you can make a dir in /var/run and chown it to the user (but /var/run is lost on reboot)
<leeyaa>	yes i tried that too we did not want to add stuff in the script to create that directory
<peetaur2>	using /tmp is probably fine, but should be cleared on reboot
<leeyaa>	it does get cleared on reboot
<larsemil>	did anyone try compiling for arduino due using ino? i get this error: avr-g++: error: unrecognized argument in option '-mmcu=cortex-m3'
<larsemil>	thinking if there is any lib i might be missing?
<ayecee>	larsemil: no, that's not an error that would be caused by a missing lib
<larsemil>	after that error it lists the supported mmcu options.
<ayecee>	it's probably because cortex-m3 isn't an avr cpu
<larsemil>	dang it.
<larsemil>	ino states it should support the arduino due.
<ayecee>	what?
<ayecee>	who is ino, and what's an arduino due?
<ayecee>	oh hey, that's a thing. neat.
<leeyaa>	lol
<ayecee>	well, what are you referring to? an online post?
<voldial>	I'm trying to understand why there are so many ways to re-invent IPC, why all these other methods? Why not just use loopback and whatever protocol they like? Seems like a easier to debug design since existing interception tools work. If that's too slow in the custom packet extreme isnt that a OS design problem? I read the DBUS/DCOP wiki pages and I dont see why they are necessary vs standard network comm.
<peetaur2>	voldial: because they're shiny
<peetaur2>	voldial: and they do things that you think you need but probably don't, like have multiple processes sharing the stream and some fine grain permission stuff
<peetaur2>	voldial: maybe if you find some dbus fans that know how to code with it, they can tell you more specifically what they think it has that sockets and other standard stuff don't have
<peetaur2>	maybe in #C for example
<voldial>	peetaur2: yam the premissions stuff seems like a paper-over real application security. If the app wanted, it could be required to have the right key... and then the "hey we have flags" stuff would be unnecessary... right?
<penos>	hello friends
*	nick_fury is now known as tihsllub
<i5um41ru>	where to check dovecot log?? I can't telnet localhost 110 - it say conenction refused.
<SpiceMan>	voldial: if you only want IPC, d-bus is overkill
<jhodrien>	Indeed, that's what the dbus developers say.
<SpiceMan>	if you want broadcasting, interfaces, and whatnot that dbus gives you
<SpiceMan>	using sockets is reinventing the wheel
<peetaur2>	i5um41ru:    touch ~/nowfile;   telnet localhost 110;    find /var/log -newer ~/nowfile
<peetaur2>	i5um41ru: also try    lsof -Pni | grep LISTEN
<SpiceMan>	abstraction layers is what coding is about, mostly. you're complaining about an abstraction layer you don't need. don't see the point.
<voldial>	but... we have brodcasting on the local net. even multicast... I know I'm missing something but I dont understand what
<SpiceMan>	if you don't need it, don't use it.
<peetaur2>	SpiceMan: instead of reinventing the wheel, why not just have a simple library that does that stuff with sockets, instead of a daemon like dbus?
<peetaur2>	I'm not coding any abstractions, but from my perspective, dbus sucks because it's the first thing to waste cpu, crash, eat memory, or be the cause of some unresolvable problem in a desktop machine
<SpiceMan>	voldial: yes. it's aimed for desktop applications IPC
<peetaur2>	(assuming you don't run systemd, ... otherwise the 2nd thing)
<voldial>	SpiceMan: I dont, but it's not easy. I find my self editing ebuilds to get things to compile (like webkit-gtk) without (for example) dbus. Everyting works fine without it (for me) so I want to know what I am amissing.
<voldial>	as far as I can tell, it's a bunch of unecessary complexity geared to maing it easier to program unity-like desktop enviroments without doing the (imho) right thing and making network standards
<MrElendig>	dbus is quite stable these days, good enough for use in cars
<penos>	hey brothers
<penos>	god bless you
<annihilannic>	MrElendig: What about buses though?
<SpiceMan>	voldial: "making network standards"?
<voldial>	SpiceMan: can I sniff dbus with wireshark?
<i5um41ru>	peetaur2: there is no output when using find /var .....
<i5um41ru>	peetaur2: i'm using squirrelmail .. and i can't login, it said connection refused 111
<SpiceMan>	voldial: AFAIK, dbus is just a daemon holding a pool of sockets, akin to any server ever.
<SpiceMan>	if I'm correct, I don't see what stops anyone from sniffing :p
<SpiceMan>	if I'm not, no idea.
*	SpiceMan couldn't care less about Dbus
<voldial>	SpiceMan: aah. ok. I'll read more. thanks.
<MrElendig>	voldial: you can simply use dbus-monitor
<voldial>	MrElendig: but can I use std net tools?
<MrElendig>	voldial: also https://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/d/dbus.html
<MrElendig>	but who reads the docs anyway
<voldial>	MrElendig: sorry. thanks for the link.
<howlymowly>	hi everyone.. short question: I want to use screen in a script to run a program in the background as a deamon (the command is "screen roscore"). When I use screen like this it does not load my environment variables configured in .bashrc   when I first log in to screen and then start "roscore"  from within a screen environment it works...  any idea how to deal with this?
<MrElendig>	voldial: it is also the first hit for "wireshark dbus"
<MrElendig>	:p
<MrElendig>	howlymowly: that is because you are not running bash in that screen window
<MrElendig>	why do you need the users env btw?
<howlymowly>	MrElendig: is the bash automatically started, when I use the screen command "as is"
<howlymowly>	?
<MrElendig>	or rather why do roscore need it?
<voldial>	what I should have read first: http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-faq.html
*	MrElendig is looking forward to kdbus
<howlymowly>	MrElendig: I use a framework called ros, which make extensive use of environent variables  and roscore is the central program of this framework. It communicates with several other programs, configures PATH variables  etc....  I don't want to do the configuration "twice" for the use bash and screen environment
<howlymowly>	*the bash and screen environment
<MrElendig>	wrap it in a shell then
<howlymowly>	MrElendig: I am just wondering:  if I start screen without any arguments it seems to automatically login to a shell ..  could I just tell screen to always do this automatically?  I guess I  don't really understand the concept of screen yet :/
<peetaur2>	howlymowly: what do you want it to do?
<i5um41ru>	peetaur2: here is my log.. any idea about this .. http://pastie.org/10177493
<howlymowly>	peetaur2: I would like to know why this command  does not work:    "screen roscore"   where "roscore" needs several environment variables and exported library paths to work which are set up in my bashrc.
<peetaur2>	i5um41ru: I think it should seem obvious from the messages there... it clearly says it doesn't have +w and so it should be in a group for that
<naphtha>	howlymowly: screen allows you to open multiple shells while you remain in one console/terminal. also, you may detatch the screen, and logout; the process(es) are still running. tmux also does this.
<peetaur2>	howlymowly: maybe try  screen 'bash -c roscroe'
<peetaur2>	well actualy that doesn't work
<peetaur2>	I probably know how to do that in .screenrc but not the command line
<howlymowly>	naphtha: thats something I already understand, what I do not is:  why is there a difference starting screen solely and THEN starting roscore (works) vs.. starting screen with roscore as argument (does not work, presumably, becuase environment is not setup as a bash, so bashrc doesn't get source for example)
<howlymowly>	peetaur2: hmm.  yeah tried it, does not work ;)
<naphtha>	howlymowly: you can use 'screen -a' to skip that start screen.
<peetaur2>	or "startup_message off" in .screenrc .... but that's not what he needs
<howlymowly>	naphtha: doesn't work either, gives me the same errors when using "screen -a roscore"
<naphtha>	oh, i was just saying it would skip that start screen. =)
<naphtha>	i have no idea how to fix your issue.
<prillian5>	how can i determine which wlan-standard my networkadapter support?
<naphtha>	howlymowly: you might try the same thing with tmux.
<howlymowly>	prillian5: I think it was with iwconfig
<prillian5>	thank you. 802.11bgn
<naphtha>	howlymowly: does your script use #!/bin/bash ?
<howlymowly>	naphtha: no, it is actually a python script
<naphtha>	howlymowly: this might be of interest? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3661566/python-source-home-bashrc-with-os-system
<howlymowly>	naphtha: no, not really, but thx..  a little bit different form my problem :)  I think I will try in #screen
<naphtha>	howlymowly: good luck out there. =)
<howlymowly>	naphtha:  thx ;)

<viruser>	Is there a program to share a wired internet connection through a wifi network without having me set up all the ip tables and routing settings?
<peetaur2>	viruser: just set up shorewall if you don't like ugly raw iptables
<peetaur2>	but I sorta think you shouldn't just use some magic thing that automatically does it all for you in the most perfectly wonderful (and yet totally wrong) way
<peetaur2>	or look up other iptables frontends
<viruser>	hmm.. I do understand how to do it manually, But sometimes I'm just lazy and forget something in the middle of the configuration
<viruser>	which causes headaches
<peetaur2>	I find shorewall to be the least painful (and not dumbed down), but find your own favorite way. I just figure you don't like the raw iptables where you can easily make some mistakes.
<viruser>	I'll give shorwall a shot. thanks
<nodweber>	When I start process it automatically spawns multiple(5 in these case) childs of it.. several processes are started this way. Is there any configuration ?
<spreeuw>	nodweber: what program?
<peetaur2>	nodweber: I doubt your question has an answer. This behavior and whether it is configurable is likely specific to that program.
<nodweber>	nodejs
<nodweber>	I checked, there is no fork
<nodweber>	okay, maybe thats nodejs specific, thanks )
<spreeuw>	nodweber: standalone or on a webserver?
<nodweber>	spreeuw: standalone, listening on TCP
<lucido>	I'm on a four monitor setup and I would like to find a way to put unused monitors to sleep depending on activity. What's the mechanism that X uses to determine activity and to sleep displays?
<peetaur2>	lucido: to do that I think you'll end up scripting something custom... maybe tracking the mouse to see which desktops it goes to, and using xrandr to remove screens... and maybe if the mouse hovers on the edge, add them again :D
<lucido>	peetaur2, yes, that woud work for activity detection, but I dont want to remove the screen, I want to put it into sleep mode
<lucido>	xset dpms will put all the displays into sleep mode I think
<shadok>	lucido: Just out of curiosity, what's your setup regarding the GPU(s) and the screens?

<lucido>	xrandr --output DFP1 --off removes the display for the desktop thus blinking the other screens and rearranging the windows
<peetaur2>	oh yeah disabling a screen would rearrange things and not be just like a disabled monitor :D
<lucido>	peetaur2, its a workaround, otherwise it would turn on the screens immediately
<peetaur2>	but work around what? what is the problem with doing it immediately?
<lucido>	peetaur2, dont know the mechanism
<peetaur2>	and how do you turn them on again?
<peetaur2>	maybe the sleep is because otherwise hitting enter to turn off would turn them on again?
<lucido>	peetaur2, don't know, it's irrelewant
<lucido>	v*
<rivarun>	hello. can i, with a regex, select all 4-digit numbers, except for a certain 4-digit number?
<rivarun>	i'd like to use this with sed specifically
<peetaur2>	rivarun: simplest is likely 2 conditions  x ~ /^[0-9]$/ && x != '1234'
<peetaur2>	I forgot my {4} in there after]
<lucido>	rivarun, no, but I can draw u a state machine
<peetaur2>	haha state machine?
<lucido>	peetaur2, they are equivalent
<Lartza_>	What's wrong with this ufw application? http://paste.linuxassist.net/view/f2aed2c8
<Lartza_>	It fails with ValueError, if I only have the udp on ports it works so it's about that
*	Lartza_ is now known as Lartza
<peetaur2>	Lartza: you mean so-called uncomplicated firewall?
<Lartza>	Yes
<peetaur2>	Lartza: I didn't know it had such syntax... where is that file? how do you load it?
<Lartza>	peetaur2: /etc/ufw/applications.d/custom, and ufw has app commands, I enable that with ufw allow "Teamspeak 3"
<Lartza>	It's like the own profiles it has, ufw allow SSH etc.
<howlymowly>	naphtha, MrElendig: the #screen guys had the right command for me ;)   screen bash -i -c roscore  @peetaur2  you were almost right ;)
<MrElendig>	howlymowly: I told you to do that
<peetaur2>	Lartza: this page says to use | not ,  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Uncomplicated_Firewall
<MrElendig>	11:13:47* MrElendig ╡ wrap it in a shell then
<MrElendig>	^_^
<peetaur2>	Lartza:     port1,port2/udp   port1/udp|port2/udp  but not like you did
<howlymowly>	MrElendig: yeah, I tried it with "bash -c"    but I missed the "i"
<howlymowly>	^^ but thx :)
<Lartza>	peetaur2: I'll try, I just followed how it has it's own, WWW Full is ports=80,443/tcp
<Lartza>	:D
<peetaur2>	Lartza: that example matches what the wiki says though.... no /tcp after the 80
<Lartza>	peetaur2: that means both tcp and udp then
<peetaur2>	Lartza: so try    ports=9987/udp|10011,30033/tcp
<Lartza>	| worked
<Lartza>	thanks! how did I miss that I read the arch wiki
<peetaur2>	no it says it's a port list then /tcp as in all in the list are tcp then
<Lartza>	Oh if I needs /tcp and /udp on the list then...
<peetaur2>	glad to help... even though I hate ufw :D (uncomplicated is a fine goal... dumbed down is not :P)
<Lartza>	so 80,443/tcp would work
<Lartza>	well, it's easy enough :D
<Lartza>	I don't know what else to use
<Lartza>	except pure iptables
<peetaur2>	I use shorewall... I find it useful for any task (router, virtual host, plain machine)
<peetaur2>	so it means I only have to master one tool for all those use cases
<Lartza>	I just use ufw everywhere
<Lartza>	Or no firewall if behind NAT
<peetaur2>	I put everything behind NaT and use shorewall anyway on mostly all
<Lartza>	Well this is a VPS I am setting up so no NAT :P
<Lartza>	just ufw
<peetaur2>	any production machine should have a firewall
<peetaur2>	especially when there are windows machines on the network ;)
<Lartza>	Yes, that's why ufw on this
<Lartza>	I think I don't run any firewall on my home RPi but that's about it
<Lartza>	It's behind a modem's firewall so
<peetaur2>	when is the last time you updated the firmware on that? and is it open source and audited? if unsure, then consider it pwned already and add a firewall :D
*	margaux-billard is now known as Casseur_fou
<Lartza>	It's ISP owned so no firmware updates by me, that's probably even worse :P
<peetaur2>	sometimes audits on proprietary home routers like that end up finding things like manufacturer's back doors where you just add a browser header or something and can get full access from the WAN
<Lartza>	I only know that the modem sucks
<Lartza>	:D
<Lartza>	No DMZ, no bridged except by asking customer support to open port 4 and run the config remotely
<Lartza>	But it gets IPTV with the VDSL2 soo... can't change to a own modem
<rascul>	sure you can
<Lartza>	I need the configs and I can't get them out from that and ISP doesn't release...
<rascul>	they have to
<peetaur2>	at my dad's house, there is the crappy rogers security hole buggy modem on the front that forwards all to a linux router, and then the real config goes there
<rascul>	in the us, it's illegal for an isp not to allow you to use your own equipment
<Lartza>	I once tried to put the IPTV box behind a router and that didn't even work
<Lartza>	rascul: I CAN use my own modem, Internet works just IPTV won't
<Lartza>	:P
<Lartza>	And I am in Finland
<rascul>	hrm
<rascul>	ahh
<peetaur2>	that router is so bad that sometimes connections fail and if you retry them they just time out as if the server is down (but isn't), and then if you stop trying for 5 min or reboot the router, it works again.
<rascul>	i dunno about iptv stuff, though
<peetaur2>	if you retry for 5 min, it won't start working again though
<shadok>	peetaur2: and sometimes the vulnerability is patched so badly that it doesn't change anything: http://www.devttys0.com/2015/04/what-the-ridiculous-fuck-d-link/
<Lartza>	They have to allow own modem's in Finland too for network but yeah, IPTV is a pain
<peetaur2>	and that router is also the modem, so that's why it isn't simply removed
<peetaur2>	shadok: haha
<Lartza>	rascul: Some people have captured the configs or something but it's still a dodgy to set up the IPTV on your own equipment
<Lartza>	On another ISP people have managed it I think
<Lartza>	And like I said, I tried to get multicast over a router to the IPTV box
<Lartza>	I could only get channels to show, or stuff like EPG to work
<Lartza>	not both at the same time :D
<Lartza>	And this is a full on IPTV, no coaxial + ethernet just ethernet
<Lartza>	It even downloads the firmware from the ISP when it boots, doesn't store it permanently if you pull the plug and only goes to a sleep state from the remote
<nucc1>	anyone know what the options for "host" type are: https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/Hosts-and-Cross_002dCompilation.html
<Lartza>	nucc1: I think it's the same setting that CHOST
<Lartza>	And I think any --host that you have a compiler set-up for works
<nucc1>	Lartza: CHOST is supposed to be an environment variable?
<Lartza>	Yeah
<Lartza>	nucc1: https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc-4.2/buildstat.html
<nucc1>	i just have a plain ubuntu install on an x86_64
<nucc1>	a-ha, thanks. that seems to list them all
<Lartza>	If you want to compile for that, you don't set --host
<nucc1>	if i leave out —host, configure fails.
<Lartza>	:O
<nucc1>	i just wanted to see what the host for 64-bit was
<Lartza>	should be x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
<Lartza>	or similar
<Lartza>	What are you configuring?
<nucc1>	yea, the list has it. thanks :)
<nucc1>	ssldump
<nucc1>	unmaintained program
<Lartza>	Seems to need the --host yeah
<Lartza>	You can --host=i686-pc-linux-gnu on 64-bit too though
<nucc1>	yea, my guess would be that it is needed for ssldump anyway
<nucc1>	it was just a curiosity trip
<Lartza>	https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ss/ssldump/PKGBUILD
<Lartza>	This seems to have settled for 686 on 64-bit too
<Lartza>	So maybe there's a problem compiling with 64-bit host

<decentdog>	Hi, my external USB drive is only seen when I suspend/resume my laptop. Just plugging it in produces absolutely no events neither in `udevadm monitor`, nor in plain `dmesg`. How can I debug this?
<Trudko>	Hi guys I 've been using Ubuntu for  more over an year and I find it still bit unstable. Is there some simple distro which doesn't require much maintance? I guess there is only Mint, elementary os there?
<moetunes>	decentdog:  using any power saving stuffs ?
<decentdog>	moetunes: yeah, laptop-mode or whatever it's called these days
<moetunes>	decentdog:  that can turn off power to the usbs
<decentdog>	moetunes: the LED on the USB is on though, so I assume that's not the case?
<moetunes>	hard to see from here...
<rrman>	It could be, I had this problem, too. Laptop-mode would disable my USB mouse
<peetaur2>	Trudko: are you using unity? only ubuntu uses it, so their userbase is lower, it's less mature, etc. so it sucks
<shadok>	decentdog: it's possible that only the pins for data are disabled in this case
<Trudko>	peetaur2: yeah do you think unity is really that big of problem?
<peetaur2>	Trudko: and if you want a debian based one, then maybe your list is good; otherwise consider manjaro too (my favorite) :)
<peetaur2>	Trudko: I'm not sure which issues you have, but yeah, unity can be a huge problem
<peetaur2>	like if the desktop crashes and programs don't work there, maybe you can blame unity. But if it fails to boot, update, network fails, etc. maybe it's not related to unity.
<Trudko>	peetaur2: well small annoyances here and there I guess part of it is still linux generally related(like crapier drivers) some I dont know. Seems like ElementaryOS is on right track
<shadok>	Trudko: try another desktop environment before changing distro, like lxde or xfce but if it's related to device support (due to drivers) that won't help
<Trudko>	seems like Ubuntu is trying do too much features rather then doing some of them really well? Not sure here I am not that linux savy
<Trudko>	shadok: well on problem I have is that I am running folding home but it seems when I turn it on it slows my pc and this isnt problem on Windows(on same machine)
<Trudko>	maybe I just set it up wrong , nto sure
<Voyage>	kurahaupo,  there?
<shadok>	Trudko: folding@home is made to use you cpu, there should be a way to limit it to some of your cpu's cores only and that should help but it's no wonder it slows down your experience
<Trudko>	shadok: well sure I got it on medium but this isnt problem on windows I guess that might be just software related

<Matviy>	Hello! I'm trying to create a one-line command that can cd to a semi dynamic path. Pretty much i have a path like /Applications/Foo/1.0.2/Final that i'm trying to cd to
<Matviy>	but the 1.0.2 changes sometimes to a newer version, which i have to be able to go to
<Matviy>	So what i created is cd "/Applications/Foo/`ls -vr | head -1`/Final"
<Matviy>	pretty much putting `ls -vr | head -1` inside the command, which should always output the folder with the highest version
<peetaur2>	cd $(ls -1 /Applications/Foo/*/Final | sort | tail -n 1)      (violates the "don't parse ls" rule.... not sure how to do it without that but short and simple)
<peetaur2>	Matviy: your ls there won't work because it doesn't cd first or prepend the path to search in
<deniska>	another option would be maintaining /Applications/Foo/latest/Final symlink
<peetaur2>	and when breaking the don't parse ls rule, at least use -1
<peetaur2>	deniska: that is a good option... I do that for tomcat and java :)
<peetaur2>	(and then my init scripts, etc. just use the link)
<Matviy>	here's the thing, when i run my command, i end up getting error: -bash: cd: /Applications/Foo/1.2.2.2/Final: No such file or directory
<Matviy>	but that's a totally valid path, 1.2.2.2 is there
<deniska>	symlink will work in 99.9% of uses, shell script solution will work only when you have the access to shell
<ExtraSteve>	I've got a directory full of CSV files, is there a fast way of comparing the first line (header line) of each file against all the others to make sure that each CSV file has the same format?
<peetaur2>	ExtraSteve: head -n1 * | sort | uniq -c
<colo-work>	peetaur2 wins!
<gustopn>	hey, is there a way how to look up all connections a firewall keeps, i mean iptables, something like pfctl -s states ?
<colo-work>	except that "| sort -u" would be even less typing and forks ;)
<gustopn>	so basically how to look up states current in iptables, hm?
<peetaur2>	no, sort -u will prevent uniq from counting
<ExtraSteve>	peetaur2: hah! That's clever
<ExtraSteve>	I was trying to figure out how to make diff do it
<gustopn>	or is it that built in to linux, that i should rather use netstat and netstat-na
<ExtraSteve>	But I like your method better
<gustopn>	netstat-nat
<shadok>	peetaur2: Matviy sort even has a "semantic versioning" flag
<ExtraSteve>	Thanks peetaur2 :)
<peetaur2>	no prob
<Matviy>	peetaur2, hm when i run your command i get libc++abi.dylib no such file or directory
<Matviy>	also, i don't just have one 1.0.0.1 folder, there are multiple version folders in there and i need to pick the latest one
<ExtraSteve>	peetaur2: head -n1 prints 3 lines when you use a wildcard * on it
<ExtraSteve>	But no worries, I got it figured out :)
<peetaur2>	Matviy: compare output of the 3 parts to see what happens....    ls -1 /Applications/Foo/*/Final       ls -1 /Applications/Foo/*/Final | sort
<ExtraSteve>	(it prints a blank line, then ==> filename.csv <==, then the first line
<ExtraSteve>	I"m sure theres a way to make head exclude the extra junk though
<peetaur2>	head -n prints one line per file that matches, and then sort and uniq trim it down to one if they are all the same, so you can identify how many duplicates there are because of -c, and how many different version are since all versions are displayed once
<ExtraSteve>	Ah, apparently -q needs to be supplied to head also
<peetaur2>	ohh you mean that stuff
<ExtraSteve>	Yeah
<peetaur2>	yeah I guess I was missing q
<ExtraSteve>	No worries - you still solved my problem
<ExtraSteve>	Thanks again!
<BlackPanx>	can one change sector size on disk ? or is it provided by manufacturer ?
<BlackPanx>	and can't be changed ?
<BlackPanx>	let's have example from fdisk -l on a random disk:
<BlackPanx>	Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
<BlackPanx>	I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
<BlackPanx>	these numbers cannot be changed ?
<BlackPanx>	i'd like it to be 4096 or so...
<BlackPanx>	can one change that ?
<blind>	i think you need a 4k disk to have 4k sectors.
<BlackPanx>	so basically manufacturer should make 4k sectors...
<BlackPanx>	and i can't change it
<nbt>	yes it's fixed by the manufacturer
<BlackPanx>	okay, so physical and logical sectors cannot be changed. but block size can be.
<nbt>	afaik most new drives have 4k sectors, but they use 512 byte logical sectors for backwards compatibility
<BlackPanx>	i see
<nbt>	my drive says
<nbt>	Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes
<BlackPanx>	okay so you have 4096 sector size actually.
<nbt>	BlackPanx: yes, but software only sees them as 512 bytes
<peetaur2>	you could possibly hack your firmware to change it ... but don't expect good results ;)
<Psi-Jack>	Not true
<BlackPanx>	um... okay
<nbt>	BlackPanx: it'll be next to impossible to ever have real 4k sectors, since too much software assumes 512 bytes
<BlackPanx>	so okay, this is something you can't change unless flashing disk firmware.
<nbt>	maybe in a few decades
<peetaur2>	s/too much software/stupid OSses you shouldn't use anyway/
<Psi-Jack>	Such uninformed people. LOL
<peetaur2>	/...like windows xp/
<peetaur2>	Psi-Jack: perhaps you should inform us then. Bask us in your great and wonderous wisdom.
<BlackPanx>	okay, what about block size ? this is what one can actually change, right? block size is basically set manually at partitioning, right ?
<nbt>	BlackPanx: yes, block size is a feature of the file system
<BlackPanx>	if it's only file system feature, how come blockdev --getbsz /dev/sdh reports block size? it was never formatted in any filesystem... only /dev/sdh1 in my case has ext4 on it
<peetaur2>	BlackPanx: same reason dolphin says "folders" instead of "directories"
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<nbt>	BlackPanx: I think that's actually reporting (logical) sector size
*	unreal_ is now known as unreal
<BlackPanx>	unfortunately no, because that one is 512 for logical and 512 for physical
<BlackPanx>	so it's not near 4096 as reported by blockdev.
<peetaur2>	well actually blockdev seems just plain wrong... it says 4096 for everything I give it, including my 512/512 SSD and a Hitachi HDS5C3030ALA630 also 512/512
<BlackPanx>	no.
<BlackPanx>	wrong
<peetaur2>	it also says 4096 for a loop device
<BlackPanx>	xenondev ~ $ blockdev --getbsz /dev/sde1
<BlackPanx>	512
<BlackPanx>	here it says 512
<nbt>	it reports 512 on my 4k physical sector disk, fwiw
<BlackPanx>	blockdev --getbsz /dev/sde
<BlackPanx>	4096
<BlackPanx>	but for sde itself
<BlackPanx>	it says 4096
<BlackPanx>	which is kinda weird
<nbt>	yes, I've no idea what it's reporting
<nbt>	Psi-Jack probably knows :)
<peetaur2>	but if I make a 512 byte loop device, it says 512, and if I make it 1024 bytes long, it says 1024
<Psi-Jack>	cat /sys/class/block/sdX/queue/physical_block_size
<Psi-Jack>	cat /sys/class/block/sdX/queue/logical_block_size
<Psi-Jack>	Adjust sdX with correct drive. :)
<peetaur2>	I like abusing grep for this. :)   grep . /sys/class/block/sd*/queue/{logical,physical}_block_size
<peetaur2>	to prefix filename
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<Psi-Jack>	peetaur2: Good one actually. :)
<BlackPanx>	Psi-Jack: those are numbers that fdisk -l reports for physical and logical sector size.
<Psi-Jack>	Yep.
<BlackPanx>	but blockdev... not sure what it reports.
<Psi-Jack>	Because, that's where fdisk gets those numbers. :p
<peetaur2>	blockdev reports *block size of course...               *block size: undefined
<BlackPanx>	if undefined, then blocksize = 4096 ?
<BlackPanx>	huh
<BlackPanx>	it reports 4096 for a raw device...
<peetaur2>	wtf does that mean :D  " the block size is specific to the current file descriptor opening the block device, so the change of block size  only  persists  for  as  long  as               blockdev has the device open, and is lost once blockdev exits."
<nucc1>	Lartza: gdb to the rescue :)
<lucido>	dff
<Lartza>	nucc1: Yeah sorry I didn't even look at ssldump, moving servers currently so I've been on that :)
<BlackPanx>	i removed all partitions, it's blank device... no partitioning and even dd'ed first few bytes with /dev/zero, and it still blockdev reports 4096 block size... pretty weird.
<BlackPanx>	so probably blockdev just works wrongly...
<BlackPanx>	and one should check tune2fs or something like that for actual block size
<BlackPanx>	of a filesystem
<peetaur2>	not wrongly, just uses a term that they define in some way you would not expect
<Psi-Jack>	Heh, so strange.
<Psi-Jack>	But fun.. The only actual 4k sector drives I have are WD Red's I have in one of my hypervisor servers.
<BluesKaj>	Psi-Jack, never understood why servers are run in VMs ...faster access to the data or something?
<Silmarilion>	I use ghostscript to merge multiple pdf files into one, can ghostscript be used to add some overlay text on the all pages like 'For Preview only'
<peetaur2>	BluesKaj: it's just easier to provision parts of the host for specific tasks... no worrying about some developer doing "sudo make install" and trashing the disk
<peetaur2>	BluesKaj: much better than just dumping 100s of services in the rootfs making an unmaintainable mess; and also you can upgrade one vm at a time if you want... no need for the entire server to go offline for a kernel update or something to fix some issue with only one service
<peetaur2>	and separate access rights; and also totally different OSses (I'm running debian, 3 or so versions of ubuntu, a windowsxp or two ;) and some centos and oracle linux)
<BluesKaj>	peetaur2, thanks, your explanation makes sense to me now, about servers and security and accessability
<BlackPanx>	block size is 4k default and it should not be larger than memory page size... does that mean to achieve better write/read performance on disk for large files (10G+ size of each file) you have to increase memory page size AND block size ?
<Psi-Jack>	BluesKaj: Not really. Just separation of processing, containment, differential scheduling. I can make a VM get only 1/4th the number of CPU cycles as the physical server it's actually running on. Likewise, the disk I/O can be tuned down as well.
<nucc1>	i wouldn't think so. as long as they are perfect multiples of each other, it shouldn't really mater
<nucc1>	err, ignore what i said
<Tazmain>	Hi all, can someone help me with setting up my pptp vpn . It keeps failing. I am trying both manually and with NetworkManager UI. Here is a log of http://pastebin.com/7QvfkAPg

<Tazmain>	Psi-Jack, yeah I know, NoComment on that. But I am really stuck. I can possible reboot the router and enable L2TP or IPsec? But I do really need some help on setting it up
<Psi-Jack>	And PPTP VPN can be broken into in mere minutes.
<Tazmain>	okay disregarding the security I really need help
<bls>	work doesn't have an IT department?
<Psi-Jack>	Heh
<nucc1>	they all use windows
<nucc1>	:)
<Tazmain>	no too small so no IT dept. and yes they all use windows
<nucc1>	Tazmain what's the issue
*	solotitan is now known as Guest51803
<Psi-Jack>	Tazmain: Best I'll give you is this horrible arch wiki: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PPTP_VPN_client_setup_with_pptpclient
<Psi-Jack>	Otherwise, I won't support PPTP as it's the most insane VPN to use.
<Tazmain>	nucc1, I can't get the connection going. I logged into the router its using PAP and CHAP. But I pasted the journalctl log, http://pastebin.com/7QvfkAPg
*	zz_AlphaTech is now known as AlphaTech
<nucc1>	Tazmain: yea, follow Psi-Jack's guide. could be a problem with network-manager
<Tazmain>	Psi-Jack, I am using NetworkManager. I have not gone to the trouble of doing the manual way.
<super_mrwu>	xeon-enouf: the changes are pushed to the Ext2fsd commercial git repo.
<Psi-Jack>	AlphaTech: Thank you for letting us know you've woken up. We all REALLY needed and wanted to know that. Now, please stop updating us. :p
<peetaur2>	Tazmain: get them to give you an ssh server, and then use sshuttle to connect to that. Works great, except icmp, and linux only.
<Tazmain>	Okay then the options file. can I paste it and someone tell me what I need to set or relax ?
<bls>	guess I'm lucky. the IT department is big enough that there's a "rogue" group of linux users that fought to get rid of the policy of immediately closing tickets for linux users
<nucc1>	Tazmain: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=186213
<Psi-Jack>	Tazmain: NM is like a dream when it comes to that setup. So freaking easy. :p
<super_mrwu>	xeon-enouf: the new version is probably going to be published few days later
<peetaur2>	bls: hah... good work
<Tazmain>	nucc1, modules needed then ?
<nucc1>	Tazmain: from looking at the logs, it seems like your computer cannot communicate with the vpn remote endpoint
<nucc1>	so you need to first make sure that PPTP is actually possible from the admin
<bls>	so none of it is official, but there's a group of decent techs that'll troubleshoot issues linux users encounter (90% of which are infrastructure and not desktop anyway) and we've got on-site mirrors of most of the major distros
*	PrincessAww is now known as Aww
<BluesKaj>	openvpn an option? ...easy to setup and works well on windows
<nucc1>	BluesKaj: openvpn is only an option if your work vpn is based on openvpn
<BluesKaj>	with windows rather
<super_mrwu>	bls: well done
<Tazmain>	nucc1, it is, works in windows for me
*	Smuckerz is now known as JarOfPharmacutic
<peetaur2>	nucc1: or just add another work vpn that doesn't suck
*	JarOfPharmacutic is now known as JarOfDrugs
<peetaur2>	nucc1: maybe try the softether clieint on your existing vpn ... it supports lots of protocols
<Tazmain>	well guys like I said I can enable L2TP or IPSEC on the router for vpn ?
<deniska>	pptp works over IP protocol which is not both tcp or udp, sometimes it may get blocked by a router
<bls>	if you're struggling with PPTP, IPSEC isn't going to be any easier. in fact probably more difficult
<deniska>	pptp is nothing but problems >_<
<BluesKaj>	nucc1, yes but he didn't mention a prortocol
<Tazmain>	so L2TP ?
<Tazmain>	I have access to the router so I can change this. Currently only ppptp is enabled
<nucc1>	Tazmain: it's definitely a communication problem. make sure no firewall on your box, is perhaps dropping the traffic
<Psi-Jack>	Heh,  L2TP over IPSEC is the better route, but also a royal PITA to setup. Hence, why OpenVPN was born.
<Tazmain>	nucc1, I am sure I don't have a firewall setup
<nucc1>	on your laptop, you'd be surprised
<deniska>	Too bad there's no "no need much enterprize security, just gimme a vpn over tcp/udp" solution =)
<Tazmain>	yeah on my laptop. If I didn't install it , it won't be on.
<deniska>	OpenVPN is pretty simple to setup but still not trivial like an ssh server =)
<nucc1>	Tazmain: many linuxes ship with firewalls these days, especially fedora, i think
<Tazmain>	Arch does not iirc
<nucc1>	Tazmain: if you can talk to the administrator, find out if your config-requests are reaching the endpoint
<nucc1>	as you can see from the first error in the logs "timeout sending config-requests"
*	BluesKaj used l2tp/ipsec and it was prone to lots of dropouts ..not a reliable tunnel for sure ...could have been the client though it wasn't well supported on linux IMO
<nucc1>	it means they are not getting replied to
<Tazmain>	nucc1, no such thing. Like I said I have access to the router. Its a DrayTeck Vigor
<nucc1>	Tazmain: the router type is not relevant :). My point is, is the traffic from your laptop reaching the router when you attempt to establish the tunnel?
<Tazmain>	nucc1, will have to figure out how to see that. It doens't have a wonderful interface
<nucc1>	actually i should be more specific, say the endpoint of the tunnel is 10.1.2.3
<nucc1>	you need to make sure that the traffic is reaching 10.1.2.3
<nucc1>	routers are usually not the VPN end points
<nucc1>	it's more likely to be a firewall
<nucc1>	and the firewall may have logs about connection attempts
<nucc1>	find out what your IP address is as the firewall will see it, and go check it's logs if it gets any hits from you at all
<Tazmain>	the routers firewall ?
<nucc1>	rule number one in troubleshooting network issues is to always make sure you actually have connectivity.
<nucc1>	Tazmain: which device is hosting the IP address that is the remote end of the VPN?
<nucc1>	the remote end of the VPN means the "server" address you're giving to network manager
<Tazmain>	The router is the endpoint of the vpn
<Tazmain>	what the hell, it has a syslog server. But I can't access it
<nucc1>	good. you need to find out how to see the connection attempts/logs for that router and see if your config-requests are reaching it
<nucc1>	can you ping the Gateway you configured in your network-manager for the PPTP tunnel?
<Tazmain>	yeah I can ping it
<nucc1>	you can run wireshark and run a capture for that address, and then try to establish the tunnel, and see what happens to the traffic
<Tazmain>	ffs, I need to get a windows utility to get the syslog
*	Tazmain opens wireshark 
<nucc1>	if you are only seeing config-requests, then it means the router is not replying, or the packets are not getting to it
<nucc1>	you may want to close other connections to the router so you don't pollute the view in wireshark
<BlackPanx>	what filesystem and block size would you suggest me for 10+GB files stored on my 2TB software raid5 SATA disk array ?
<nucc1>	BlackPanx: use ext4 and accept the defaults.
<BlackPanx>	i was thinking of xfs, and maybe increase block size from 4096 to more if possible
<nucc1>	i don't think it's important to worry about stuff at this level in this day and age
<Kalendium>	need help.... My <company> wants to make a wiki to share knowledge between members and procedures. What's the best site to do it. Girhut Wiki, wikia...?
<Psi-Jack>	Kalendium: Dokuwiki?
<Psi-Jack>	Confluence?
<Kalendium>	Psi-Jack: Wiki in general, with info about pdaily procedures and code related stuff
<baxx>	Is there a way to run a script 'silently'? I have a little script that just cleans out files in a directory, but chucks a few 'not founds' when they aren't all there, I don't really care about what wasn't there though
<nucc1>	BlackPanx:  http://serverfault.com/questions/496007/choosing-file-system-block-size
<nucc1>	baxx:  ./script > /dev/null
<baxx>	If I could write that Into the script that'd be better
<nucc1>	baxx:  redirect stdout to /dev/null
<baxx>	nucc1: cheers!
<baxx>	nucc1: This is the script basically : http://vpaste.net/wNd2k
<Psi-Jack>	Kalendium: Uh huh.. Now, do you have any Linux questions?
<baxx>	is there a way I can set the output within that script itself or does it have to be run as ./script > /dev/null
*	zz_AlphaTech is now known as AlphaTech
<peetaur2>	baxx:  also stderr...    >/dev/null 2>&1
<baxx>	peetaur2: is that in the script itself?
<Psi-Jack>	AlphaTech: Seriously. THANK YOU FOR SPAMMING US with constant nick changes.
<peetaur2>	baxx: you could put it in the script on every line that might print output, or just when running the script
<AppAraat>	peetaur2: what does >/dev/null mean? Redirect what exactly into /dev/null ?
<baxx>	peetaur2: Ok cool I'll try that :)
<Kalendium>	Psi-Jack: no, do you know any other channel to better ask those questions?
<peetaur2>	AlphaTech zz-AlphaTech walking-dog-AlphaTech eating-dinner-AlphaTech:  pleease disable that useless nick thing so Psi-Jack will stop spamming us
<Psi-Jack>	Kalendium: No.
<bls>	Kalendium: try #freenode for help finding a channel
<Psi-Jack>	peetaur2: Heh, I already send the http://sackheads.org/~bnaylor/spew/away_msgs.html PM. :p
<Kalendium>	bls: thanks!
<peetaur2>	AppAraat: > is stdout, and 2> is stderr
<BlackPanx>	nucc1: ty for reference. i just thought i would increase performance of my poor sata disks by increasing block size, so that when reading/writting it would be more sequential scenario and less effort for them to write large files.
<baxx>	peetaur2: yeah this works thanks! http://vpaste.net/IZytK
<BlackPanx>	and therefore maybe increase total troughput from 80MB/s as i have now, to maybe 120 or so...
<Tazmain>	nucc1, would I just use a ip.dst filter ? or ip.addr ?
<peetaur2>	baxx: could also do http://vpaste.net/SnpO6
<Pekoh>	i think i just did rm -rf /etc/ do i need to reinstall everything as I dont have a backup. Its a box i have been learning on
<rumpel>	Pekoh, yes. Reinstall.
<rumpel>	Pekoh, you just learned a valuable lesson. :D
<peetaur2>	hehe   apt-get install ....      can't find apt.conf :P
<peetaur2>	good thing this was your learning box; that is exactly what you just did
<Pekoh>	omg, noooo. for real? man all i was trying to do was avoid having to click "y" repeatedly to delete a folders contents
<rumpel>	Pekoh, rm doesn't forgive
<Pekoh>	i tried rm -r /etc/mediawiki
<peetaur2>	Pekoh: next time cp -a /etc /etc.unbroken  before that
<Pekoh>	but it said "rm: descend into directory `/etc/mediawiki'? n"
<Pekoh>	whats the best way to then delete a folder and its contents ?
<peetaur2>	Pekoh: -f will stop those, but you didn't need to remove the path too
<peetaur2>	so rm -rf was semi-fine, just don't run on /etc
<Pekoh>	it was an accident :(
<peetaur2>	better than rm -rf would be something like "apt-get purge ..."
<Pekoh>	ah but i had specifically moved it there
<peetaur2>	well from now on, double check your arguments when running rm -rf
<peetaur2>	what I do sometimes is add echo... try and watch :)     Path="/somewhere/" ;  echo rm -rf "$path"/*
<Pekoh>	ii was tabbing it out so like rm -rf /etc/ tab... display all pssobilities...n and then i think it hit enter
<Pekoh>	can i not ctrl z ? lolz
<peetaur2>	well next time put echo there until you are done
<peetaur2>	and try my example for extra fun
<Pekoh>	gah. can i try your example now
<peetaur2>	just don't forget the echo
<Pekoh>	it wont delete more items will it ?
<peetaur2>	replace "rm" with "notrallydelete" if you are unsure       Path="/somewhere/" ;  echo notreallydelete -rf "$path"/*
<Savemech>	guys could be PID pool depleted?
<peetaur2>	Savemech: yes but unlikely... the pool is something like 65535 large in old linux and maybe higher now
*	Sarge123^off is now known as Sarge123
<Pekoh>	all it did was write out "rm -rf Path/*" on a new line
<Savemech>	its 65535, at my centos7 and debian 6,7,8
<Savemech>	just wondering how container host work totaly OK with 100-200 containers running
<peetaur2>	Pekoh: well then you did something wrong. just copy and paste it
<Pekoh>	ah my bad typo
<Pekoh>	ah man, so i need to copy all that I can, omg, /etc contained my iptables rules....
<peetaur2>	yeah, /etc is not the sort of directory you want to randomly obliterate
<peetaur2>	it also contains /etc/fstab... another important file
<baldfat>	I make bitbucket git repos for each machine's config files for a backup
*	Tazmain feels distraught 
<peetaur2>	Tazmain: use sshuttle
<Tazmain>	peetaur2, so I setup a linux box at work ad sshuttle to it ? Will it give me access to the rest of the network
<peetaur2>	Tazmain: yes
<peetaur2>	Tazmain: I found that icmp doesn't work; I think I tested udp too and it worked.
<Tazmain>	any port fowarding I need to do ?
<peetaur2>	no, it does all the forwarding automatically (with an iptables redirect hack)
<rtb>	file permissions on my home directory are all over the place .. did a for f in *; do stat -c %a "$f"; done | sort -u and found these 1700 400 600 640 644 700 744 755 777 ... should there be this many different types of permissions? what should be the ideal permissions?
<Pekoh>	is there anything i can backup before reinstalling.  bitbucket git repos, might need to look into a guide on how to do that after rebuild
<peetaur2>	you give it an address range, and it adds an iptables rule to forward everything with that range as the destination to the ssh tunnels
<Tazmain>	peetaur2, could you guide me on setting it up ?
<peetaur2>	Pekoh: oh one t hing you could do......
<peetaur2>	Pekoh: shut it off, boot a live cd, then on the live cd install testdisk, and use that to undelete those files
<Pekoh>	once im in the live cd how easy is it to undelete them ?
<peetaur2>	Tazmain: just set up ordinary ssh, and then sshuttle user@host [-e 'ssh -oPort=... other special stuff goes here'] 192.168.0.0/24       (or whatever range)
<peetaur2>	Pekoh: if they ahve not been overwritten already (unmount sooner and the chance is lower), then the chance is very high, and it is not hard at all
<Tazmain>	peetaur2, where do i need to install sshsuttle on client or server ?
<peetaur2>	deleted files are taking up free space... free space could be written to at any time (such as by /var/log/messages which is still writing), so the longer it writes, the higher the risk of loss is
<peetaur2>	Tazmain: client
<peetaur2>	Tazmain: sshuttle and ssh client on client, sshd on server
<peetaur2>	(sshuttle needs to run as root since it adds the iptables rule)
<Tazmain>	yaeh that is fine
<peetaur2>	Pekoh: and I'm not sure if it lets you simply "undelete" or if you have to export them to another system. So have a usb stick, network share, or something handy to save them
<Tazmain>	peetaur2, so do  I go sshuttle test@server for instanct ?
<peetaur2>	Tazmain: plus an ip range in CIDR notation
<peetaur2>	like where I wrote 192.168.0.0/24
<peetaur2>	man sshuttle   for an explanation
<andrew39>	do you folks know what command gui copy within most desktop environments runs?
<Tazmain>	peetaur2, thanx
<peetaur2>	andrew39: what?
<andrew39>	peetaur2, it seems that a copy process i had been doing is stalled, wondering if i can cp or rsync instead to avoid the problem
<andrew39>	because the copy process i had been doing was through the right-click-copy-paste approach through the gui
<peetaur2>	andrew39: you can kill the old cp and replace with rsync, sure
<peetaur2>	okay then you might have trouble identifying what to kill, but can still do it
<peetaur2>	you could log out to stop it
<andrew39>	i can cancel it im sure
<andrew39>	im just trying to see how i can avoid it from stalling again
<peetaur2>	or just   ps -ef --forest | less    and look for something running under Xorg
<andrew39>	the copy process
<baldfat>	Pecoh: I try to have 2 git repos for a computer. I back up my dot files for all my destops in one repo and than I have the non home files I customize in another git repo
<peetaur2>	the job of a GUI is to look pretty ... so just use CLI next time for real work :)
<bls>	the copy likely not its own process and you'll need to kill your file manager
<andrew39>	i can cancel the copy process, my question really is, what approach should i use to copy 2TB of data and avoid the copy process from stalling
<Pekoh>	peetaur: i dcd did you post something after i said its downloading. Can i use hirens boot cd or testdisk,
<bls>	andrew39: use rsync
<baldfat>	Pekoh: I use bitbucket for free unlimited private repos. But this guide could help http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/
<andrew39>	what does rsync do if it reaches a block it cant copy?
<andrew39>	or can i -fvr it somehow to force it through
<baldfat>	andrew39: It fails with a log
<bls>	andrew39: it dies
<Pekoh>	baldfalt:thanks bookmarked
<andrew39>	well that won't solve my problem then it seems. im trying to copy as much as possible
<peetaur2>	Pekoh: any linux live cd likely has testdisk available (install it, don't just assume the live system has it already); I don't know if other boot things have it
<bls>	andrew39: if you want something to copy data off of bad media look into dd_rescue
<Pekoh>	ok so when i boot to it i specifically select the tool test disk
<peetaur2>	andrew39: the beauty of rsync is that it doesn't matter what it does... just run it again and if it will repeat (incremental send) whatever errors there were since it will retry anything that is not already sent
<baldfat>	andrew39: I use dd for copying but I use a hard drive the same size or bigger of the drive I am copying
*	stuff1 is now known as bruxC
<peetaur2>	heh... but dd isn't going to gracefully handle any problems, and is not simpler to use
<bls>	dd is going to suffer the same problems as cp
<peetaur2>	but if this is a bad disk, then gnu dd_rescue is a good option (but not simpler either)
<shadok>	ext4magic can be useful too for undelteing files
<bls>	so you either need rsync to resume where it left off (assuming the media is good and the failure is due to something else) or dd_rescue to retry/resize the operations
<bruxC>	just looking for a quick "yes it is" or "no it isn't" possible. is it possible to select all and copy in nano and still be able to paste outside of ssh? I'm trying to select all of a config file and paste it in pastebin.
<bruxC>	ctrl+6 and ctrl K only seems to work w/in nano but not on my actual clipboard.
<peetaur2>	bruxC: https://clbin.com/
<bls>	bruxC: nano doesn't have clipboard integration as far as I know. probably want to use a better editor
<billy71>	hi
<peetaur2>	bruxC: <command> | curl -F 'clbin=<-' https://clbin.com
<bruxC>	bls thx peetaur2 thanks as well.
<billy71>	Is rsync able to detect moved files and move them remotely instead deleting + uploading them again (which would be damn stupid)?
<sjitr>	hi
<bls>	billy71: not really rsync's job
<billy71>	So what alternative can I use then?
<peetaur2>	billy71: no I don't expect it to do that (such a thing requires building an index of contents not just names and sizes, or else a renamed file would fail just as well)
<sjitr>	That's card reader: http://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_MG_4629_2666e02eea.jpg ?
<billy71>	Backup from one windows to a samba share?
<peetaur2>	(and building an index of all contents would waste huge time)
<billy71>	I thought rsync builds indices ?
<peetaur2>	rsync just does a recursive stat thing through the tree, and does a rolling diff on file contents to find small changes
<peetaur2>	it has no index saying "here's some data... is there another file matching it with a different name and path?"
<bls>	sounds like you'd need to combine rsync with something like fdupes
<andrew39>	thanks guys, im looking into the suggesting approaches
<peetaur2>	bls: what does fdupes do... hardlink what it finds?
<peetaur2>	I could use something that does something like hardlinking
<bls>	peetaur2: it can, yes.
<bruxC>	Nice....
<bruxC>	peetaur2, this is so mmuch easier.
<billy71>	So I want this: Backup from one disk to another remote samba/windows share.
<bls>	that or you could use it to generate a list of files for rsync to ignore
<billy71>	What tool is good and amsart?
<billy71>	Because when I moved some folders, the current tools all delete the old folder and upload the moved folder.
<AppAraat>	peetaur2: ah yeah I just thought >/dev/null by itself meant something. Had no context that there was a program giving stdout before going into /dev/null.
<shadok>	peetaur2: not sure about what you want exactly but have a look at rsnapshot if you didn't already
<billy71>	That takes a lot of time.
<jhodrien>	Unison?
<peetaur2>	billy71: I use burp for backup. one advantage of it over a file share is that if you get some malware that wants to delete all remote filesystems it can reach, it can't also delete the backup.
<Tazmain>	peetaur2, how can I forward traffic from say wlan0 to eth0 ? I only need port 9000 and udp ?
<jhodrien>	rsync backup where the rsync server has readonly access to the machine you're backing up, and keeps snapshots.
<shadok>	billy71: try syncanny, they have a channel here, or rsnapshot, or rsync in a cron, or mount the share locally before using cp... there is so much solutions available, it's hard to list them all
<peetaur2>	Tazmain: you mean routing? I would use shorewall http://www.shorewall.net/two-interface.htm
<Tazmain>	peetaur2, well I want to conenct one machine to another , So I have machine a and b, but machine a can't talk to a port I need so I want machine a to talk to b , and b can talk to the port I need,
<billy71>	peetaur2, shadok: thanks
<nostrora>	Hello, can you advise me a good password manager ?
<DAL|Droid>	I have two questions 1 is there a channel for CUPS 2 is there a reason why I can't just modify a RAW CUPS printer entry to change the serial number for the local URI?
<bls>	nostrora: I just use gpg, text file, and grep
<bls>	DAL|Droid: /msg alis list yoursearchtermhere
<nostrora>	bls: i need more functionnality, like password generator with pattern
<DAL|Droid>	Clarification on 2 when switching out raw printers.
<bls>	nostrora: you can use pwgen or openssl for that
<baldfat>	peetaur2: If I had a drive that is failing I always go with dd since it is a bit for bit. Can't tell you how many times I was the hero for pulling drives and doing that ASAP.
<DAL|Droid>	bls ta
<baldfat>	nostrora: I use lastpass and recommend it
<Psi-Jack>	Total Annihilation?
<Psi-Jack>	Heh, and left already.
<nostrora>	baldfat: thanks :)
<peetaur2>	Tazmain: well sounds like proxying or routing
<baldfat>	nostrora: it cost a $1 a month to use on mobile but free for anything else
<Tazmain>	peetaur2, I guess
<nostrora>	badaptr: no i want to manage MY file. i don't want my password are on internet
<shadok>	nostrora: keepassx is fine too
<nostrora>	shadok: okey :) i find keepass and keepassx. is differend ?
<thelongdark>	anyone familiar with udisks and dbus? got a strange problem and im not sure where to turn
<baldfat>	nostrora: I second keepass but I think lastpass is worth it since everything is going to be highly randomed passwords
<shadok>	nostrora: never used keepass but it was only for windows at the start
<shadok>	baldfat: i fail to see why that is an argument
<bls>	thelongdark: ask direct questions in here. yes/no polls aren't going to get a response
<nostrora>	keepass seem more maintened than keepassx
<thelongdark>	bls,  thanks - so if i boot my machine udisks will mount ext cd rom (/dev/sr0) but if i attempt to mount it directly via a dbus call i get 3 error messages, first that the filesystem driver is missing (it isnt) second that /dev/sr0 is already mounted (it isnt) and third /media/FJHT52A is busy (it isnt - actually doesnt even exist yet)
<billy71>	shadok: syncanny would work with a cloud storage or NAS?
<shadok>	billy71: they have some plugins yes, S3 sync is in testing at the moment for example
<shadok>	but you'll need java to run it, that may be against your religion ^^
<baldfat>	shadok: Because passwords are normally easily social cracked or just a dictionary, If you go with three words or a simple pattern system for each website or computer you get caught
<nucc1>	you mean "correct battery staple horse" style is bad?
<shadok>	baldfat: that's the point of a password manager, lastpass doesn't have a monopoly on "random" afaik :) keepassx can geenrate passwords too, with a simple click
<bls>	it's better than a shorter, memorable one, but not better than a completely random long one
<nucc1>	lastpass has a kind of monopoly on ease of use
<nucc1>	the number of times i lost my keepassx database is uncountable
<nucc1>	in the end, i signed up for lastpass
<baldfat>	shadok: but it one of the few that works on mobile
<nostrora>	Thanks for KeePassX is very very good for me ! :)
<shadok>	baldfat: that may well be the case i agree but i didn't see that requirement in nostrora's question
<shadok>	nucc1: so you don't have backups, no wonder you lose data then
<nucc1>	yes, everybody likes to act smug about this.
<baldfat>	shadok: "Any one have advise on a good password manager" One that works locally and on web and mobile is important for me and maybe for him maybe not :)
<nucc1>	shadok: keepassx quite simply has failed to evolve, so i abandoned it. that's the best way of putting it.
<nucc1>	i have multiple computers, including phone.
<baldfat>	how do you back up the databse and sync it across different computers and mobile devices (Seriously asked Question)
<nucc1>	balder: some people will tell you to use dropbox.
<nucc1>	i hate it.
<ohcanada>	nucc1: not smug, just tired of hearing the same nonsense over and over
<shadok>	baldfat: i don't enter any password on my mobile devices, really
<Walex>	a password manager on a mobile phone? What a bizarre idea indeed.
<nucc1>	ohcanada: good for ya. you do backups. I don't, and keepassx sucks. I keep things i can't afford to lose in my gmail.
<baldfat>	nucc1: Dropbox for passwords is scary! Dropbox is very unsecure
<shadok>	baldfat: it's encrypted you know?
<nucc1>	baldfat: but keepassx is encrypted, right
<shadok>	nucc1: the db, yes
<baldfat>	It is encrypted and unsalted correct?
<rattking>	I like 'pass' it uses gpg and git to store passwords..
<nucc1>	ohcanada:  and for the rubbish websites that want a password anyway "just because", i just put the password in google-keep.
<baldfat>	rattking: not familar with pass
<rattking>	http://www.passwordstore.org/
<baldfat>	I scramble all my passwords and they have various lengths to all of them
<rattking>	then I set up git over ssh so all my devices can pull. Each has its own gpg key, so I can get to it if I lose all but 1 private key :)
<baldfat>	I have a friend who is a cyber security he did pen testing for the first two years. (Banks and blah blah) He has hacked into just about anything I have done except ssh and lastpass
<ohcanada>	nucc1: i know people who have lost jobs, and been thrown out of university, for losing stuff with no backups. so i take the approach that maybe, just maybe, the people who seem to drone on about backups might just have a point
<reisio>	baldfat: I could get access to his data easy
<nucc1>	ohcanada: of course they have a point. now if spideroak were more like crashplan, then i would take them more seriously.
<ohcanada>	it reminds me of car seatbelts. "i'm a safe driver, who needs seatbelts. only boring safe people wear seatbelts"
<baldfat>	Back up = two local copies and one in a different location
<nucc1>	otherwise, if i have to start choosing what to backup myself, then sendng an email to myself with the important stuff works for me
<ohcanada>	baldfat: pretty much. i'd rather "waste" time and disk space, than be up a certain fjord, without a longboat :)
<reisio>	baldfat: a correct definition if ever I heard one
<bls>	baldfat: stop being smug
<reisio>	what's wrong with smug
<Lachezar>	Hey all. I got a Windows PC, that has its HDD fail. I'm trying to perform a best-effort to save whatever I can from the HDD, so I booted a Live Xubuntu, and attached an external storage. I'm doing a "dd if=/dev/sda bs=4096 conv=noerror | gzip > sda.img.gz". However it met lots of errors. Now I'm wondering if the bad blocks will be skipped (thus making my backup useless), or replaced with zero/random stuff?
<reisio>	Lachezar: use ddrescue instead
<nucc1>	dd is the wrong way to save a failing disk
<nucc1>	i think because you'll simply dd the errors across
<billy71>	nucc1: what to use instead?
<rattking>	ddrescue or dd_rescue with a log is what you want for sure!
<ElectricTriangle>	Trying to get EFI boot working with efibootmgr, but all my computer is doing is going into the setup screen when trying to boot from the option I made... What am I doing wrong? 'sudo efibootmgr -b 0000 -d /dev/sdb --part 2 --loader '\EFI\Boot\gentookernel.efi'' partition table: http://pastebin.com/MKWUFYuq
<nucc1>	well if you can mount the filesystem, then copy whatever you can across.
<reisio>	Lachezar: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dd_%28Unix%29&oldid=516954364#Data_recovery
<nucc1>	ohcanada: will you remind billy71 about his crime of not backing up? :d
<reisio>	Lachezar: after that you can try the fun things, like putting it in a freezer for a half hour
<bls>	wow, this guys likes to live dangerously
<ElectricTriangle>	Even when rsync is so easy to use, and HDDs are so cheap.
<ElectricTriangle>	Well, relatively easy to use.
<strljex>	hi
<Lachezar>	Hm. These need a medium that is larger than the original, and are sacrificial.
<peetaur2>	Lachezar: your command is wrong... conv=noerror without sync also will offset the rest of the data after the error in the outfile
<reisio>	http://obviousmag.org/archives/uploads/200ways.pdf https://www.google.com/search?q=hard%20driver%20recovery%20tricks%20pdf etc.
<strljex>	my main is windows and second is linux. How can i see the hard disk/drive connect?
<peetaur2>	Lachezar: just use gnu dd_rescue, which will fix that and also handle bad sectors better
<reisio>	dd_rescue is actually the non-GNU one
<reisio>	'ddrescue' is what you want
<omfgtora>	it seems my python2.7 is broken
<reisio>	omfgtora: nah, 's'fine
<omfgtora>	how would i go about fixing that
<ElectricTriangle>	omfgtora: I heard details are important.
<reisio>	I heard, sharks
<ElectricTriangle>	Same
<bls>	sharks that growl?
<omfgtora>	i am afraid if i uninstall it, it will mess up my irc bot
<strljex>	how do i go into /dev/sda2
<reisio>	strljex: with a miniaturization gun
<omfgtora>	i'll get a screenshot for you... hold on
<billy71>	nucc1: hehe, but I back up! :P
<Lachezar>	Damn. Not suitable. The backup medium is neither sacrificable, nor large enough to fit without compression.
<reisio>	yay
<ElectricTriangle>	omfgtora: Once again, no details. If you're using a debian-based system you can reinstall it quite easily.
<bls>	strljex: /dev/sda2 is a block device. you can't "go into" it
<reisio>	go buy more storage, like you should've done earlier
<ElectricTriangle>	*package-based system
<strljex>	i want to see it like driver in windows
<strljex>	its a usb
<omfgtora>	oh sorry! i dont know why i forgot to mention ubuntu 14.04 (actually linuxmint 17.1)
<ElectricTriangle>	reisio: It's so cheap too...
<bls>	strljex: if you know what filesystem is on it, you can mount it somewhere
<omfgtora>	i fully accept the chastising for my stupidity
<nucc1>	which reminds me. my 1tb disk is 4 years old this year. I better proactively replace it, since I don't backup ;)
<ElectricTriangle>	omfgtora: Even with you accepting it, expect more jabbing. This is ##linux after all.
<ElectricTriangle>	nucc1: Oh you.
<Lachezar>	Uf. I'm going to call my brother to find a Windows solution. Damn.
<strljex>	i did filesystem /dev/sda2 and nothing work
<reisio>	rofl
<reisio>	now that's how you troll
<omfgtora>	ElectricTriangle: good. then hopefully i can remember being chastised and not be a noob
<ElectricTriangle>	I heard thick skins are a thing too.
<reisio>	ElectricTriangle: especially in women
<peetaur2>	Lartza: what's wrong with just using ddrescue instead of dd with your gzip there?
<ElectricTriangle>	wut
<ElectricTriangle>	omfgtora: As long as you backup your data regularly, you're probably fairly safe.
<omfgtora>	is there a repair or reinstall apt command? lol
<Lartza>	peetaur2: He left...
<omfgtora>	ElectricTriangle: i dont...
<ElectricTriangle>	omfgtora: I remember there being one, let me look it up.
<nucc1>	ElectricTriangle: i'm just joking to be honest. I have multiple disks available, I've got Crash Plan (which I hate because it doesn't encrypt) and I've got google drive (because it's convenient for my android photos) etc...
<omfgtora>	i've got a virtualbox linuxmint 17.1, so i only do snapshots every once in a while
<ElectricTriangle>	nucc1: Yeah exactly. You don't need to back up everything, just what matters.
<ElectricTriangle>	I don't backup my OS, just my user folder.
<omfgtora>	how do you backup?
<ElectricTriangle>	rsync commands
<omfgtora>	if you cant tell i am ultra-noob
<omfgtora>	man rsync
<omfgtora>	er...
<ElectricTriangle>	rsync is a classic standby for backing up things.
<omfgtora>	ah i see
<strljex>	how do i know the destination dir?
<ElectricTriangle>	omfgtora: I think the command you want is "apt-get install --reinstall putpackagenamehere"
<omfgtora>	sweet! thanks. i was still googling for that
<peetaur2>	strljex: try "lsblk"
<omfgtora>	"E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages." --fuck
<ceil>	i hate when that happens
<ElectricTriangle>	omfgtora: Open up synaptic and see what's broken.
<strljex>	omg it 1k
<omfgtora>	will synaptic tell me what is broken?
<ElectricTriangle>	omfgtora: Yes, if you use the broken packages filter.
<strljex>	I see the name but it's confusing
<omfgtora>	i see
<omfgtora>	doesnt show anything
<ElectricTriangle>	omfgtora: Presumably you used gksudo to open it right?
<ElectricTriangle>	'cause otherwise it's not gonna do much of anything
<omfgtora>	gksudo to open synaptic
<omfgtora>	?
<omfgtora>	i see
<peetaur2>	strljex: try also "lsblk -f" and some will say ext4, or ntfs, etc. so it is easier to know what they are without them being mounted
<ElectricTriangle>	Correct, it needs root permissions.
<omfgtora>	never heard of that command, gksudo
<strljex>	thanks!
<ElectricTriangle>	omfgtora: It's what you use when you need to open a graphical application with root permissions, so you don't hose certain files which will need fixing.
<ElectricTriangle>	deleting .Xauth isn't fun
<omfgtora>	i see
<omfgtora>	it's still showing nothing under broken
<ElectricTriangle>	omfgtora: Put the apt-get error on a paste site?
<omfgtora>	k
<peetaur2>	omfgtora: does a simple "apt-get install" (no package listed) print the package names that have problems?
<strljex>	peetaur2: how can i see it like on windows the folders and etc?
<omfgtora>	http://i.imgur.com/torDLYt.png
<omfgtora>	strljex: negative
<omfgtora>	i mean
<baldfat>	bls: Not trying to be smug sorry!
<omfgtora>	peetaur2: negative
<peetaur2>	strljex: the linux/unix filesystem heirarchy is not like windows... there is no C:, D:, and so on. Instead you have / as the rootfs, and then everything else has a path under that, looking like a normal directory. You have to mount something before you see it. Those C: things in windows are kinda like being automatically mounted with these generated letters.
<strljex>	Thanks but I don't know how do i mount.. I did like howtogeeks and not work
<strljex>	http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2013/01/mount-umount-examples/
<peetaur2>	omfgtora: go to #debian and read the channel topic, and try !bat or whatever it is that they smack you with to help you, and that thing has all the debug output you need
<ElectricTriangle>	omfgtora: Yikes... that's quite a web of dependencies. Not quite sure where to go with that.
<omfgtora>	interesting..
<omfgtora>	shit
<ElectricTriangle>	omfgtora: As peetaur2 suggested, #debian is less of a generic catchall channel.
<beagleGuy>	I’m running a program from the command line and it sometimes throws an exception but doesn’t exit out of the program it just hangs. Is there an easy way to run the program and if you detect a certain string in the output then stop it and re-run? I’m sure I can whip something up in python but thought there might be an easier command line way to do that
<omfgtora>	thanks guys
<omfgtora>	you are awesome
<ElectricTriangle>	Hope you solve your problem
<peetaur2>	strljex: well look at the lsblk -f output, and find an ntfs one... maybe it's called "/dev/sda5". Then "cd /mnt" and "mkdir test" and then run "mount /dev/sda5 test". And then you can "cd test" or "ls test" or whatever you need. (replace sda5 with the right path)
<strljex>	thanks im checking it
<strljex>	there is only ext2, lvm2_mem, ext4, swap, iso9660
<strljex>	do i need to run ubuntu on main?
<ssarah>	hei guys, i wana use find to run a command that pipes into something else: find . -name *.erb -exec erb -P -x -T- {} | ruby -c\;
<ssarah>	failing so far
<ssarah>	what do i do?
<baldfat>	strljex: sudo fdisk -l should list you your drives
<peetaur2>	strljex: are you looking for a windows file system?
<peetaur2>	strljex: on a disk that is currently plugged in?
<strljex>	i connect sdhc into windows and im running on it ubuntu server(vmware)
<strljex>	idont know how to answer it
<peetaur2>	you are booted on ubuntu, or a vmware virtual machine?
*	Psi-Jack widens an eye.
<peetaur2>	strljex: a virtual machine won't be able to see the host windows machine's disks.
<strljex>	im running windows as main OS and inside there is running vmware(with ubuntu server)
<strljex>	oh than i wasted my time
<Psi-Jack>	That's starting to become a lot more clear.
<Psi-Jack>	And it will, just have to share it via Network methods, like CIFS.
<peetaur2>	strljex: so what you should probably do then, is install cifs  (apt-get install cifs-common), and then on windows, make a file share, and try to mount that in linux
<strljex>	this is so complicated
<baldfat>	strljex: What is it your trying to do?
<Psi-Jack>	So, install Samba on VMWare guest OS, and in Windows, enable shares.
<peetaur2>	strljex: also there's "shared folders" which your vmware thing should have.... maybe try that (which is easier, but likely not as good)
<strljex>	baldfat: i wanna backup my raspberry pi sd card that did magic problems
<Psi-Jack>	VirtualBox actually has one up on this by vboxfs, allowing you to directly share directories from the host OS directly to the guest OS.
<peetaur2>	(or maybe not easier... I remember it was easy on vbox, but really bad on vmware+ubuntu, but maybe vmware+ some other linux will work better)
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<strljex>	i thinnk its wrong
<Psi-Jack>	"magic problems?"
*	Psi-Jack chuckles.
<strljex>	if i will share the recovery folder i see it not all the folder
<Psi-Jack>	...
<Psi-Jack>	Wow.. The logic of this one...
<omfgtora>	#debian told me to GTFO
<ElectricTriangle>	Ah, ##linux.
<ElectricTriangle>	omfgtora: um, what.
<omfgtora>	lol nah, they said they dont support mint
<omfgtora>	like... a lot
<ElectricTriangle>	I'm sure there's a mint channel.
<Psi-Jack>	We'll, d'uh.
<Psi-Jack>	Mint != Debian. :P
<Psi-Jack>	There is. #linuxmint
<omfgtora>	yeha
<omfgtora>	yeah**
<omfgtora>	i thought ubuntu came from debian?
<Psi-Jack>	Ask non-Debian questions in a Debian channel, you're likely to get your arse handed back to you in worse shape than originally offered. :p
<Psi-Jack>	omfgtora: Why would that matter?
<omfgtora>	it was just a general question
<Psi-Jack>	Ubuntu != Debian. Mint != Ubuntu != Debian
<spreeuw>	I heard debian is based on ubuntu is this true?
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<spreeuw>	its run by benevolent dictator poettering
<omfgtora>	mint != ubuntu ? i have been so misled
*	Psi-Jack rolls his eyes.
<Psi-Jack>	spreeuw: Just.. Stop. :p
<ohcanada>	wait. if my enemy's enemy is my friend, then mint == debian
<Psi-Jack>	omfgtora: Mint != Ubuntu. BASED on Ubuntu, but since they use some of their own repositories, it is no longer Ubuntu.
<annihilannic>	Psi-Jack: Just discovered recently (when I tried to set up rtorrent) that vboxsf doesn't support mmap() I/O... and they have no intention of implementing it in the foreseeable future.  Strange!
<omfgtora>	so, what makes a completely different distro is the difference in repositories?
<Psi-Jack>	annihilannic: Interesting. Though, I don't care about torrent. :p
<peetaur2>	omfgtora: I was just suggesting you take their topic and use their bot... the people there will be like that
<omfgtora>	i see
<Psi-Jack>	omfgtora: Do you see Canonical endorsing Mint?
<Taywee>	omfgtora: I always thought so.  It's a different distribution of software.  Isn't that what distro meant in the first place?
<peetaur2>	omfgtora: they are kinda rude doing that because Debian's mission is even to make a base system, not the end product ;)
<peetaur2>	rude but expected
<ayecee>	it's a variant of Theseus' paradox - how many packages must be replaced before you've got a different distribution?
<ohcanada>	omfgtora: repos and branding. and also the distribution of libraries and support files over packages. debian has lots of small packages, suse has fewer larger packages, for example
<omfgtora>	i'll do that cause i have gotten no replies from the official #linuxmin-help channel on another server, and the ##linuxmint here on freenode
<omfgtora>	i see
<omfgtora>	i am quite new to linux
<Psi-Jack>	It's okay. We know. It's obvious. :)
<omfgtora>	oh yeah
<omfgtora>	quite
<saymoo>	greetings
*	Psi-Jack moos like a cow in greeting.
<saymoo>	:D
*	hassoon rides Psi-Jack 
<hassoon>	MOOOOVE
<saymoo>	ehm
*	elgrubles is now known as grubles
<peetaur2>	saymoo: quit trolling... look what you did
<saymoo>	but but but... i wasn't me :)
<Psi-Jack>	You weren't you?
<saymoo>	I did not ride Psi-Jack :)
<hassoon>	lmfoa....
<Psi-Jack>	hah
<hassoon>	dude you're killing me of laughter
*	Psi-Jack laughs, nodding.
<triceratux>	omfgtora: distros are related phylogenetically, & many of them dont fall far from the tree. each one exists somewhere along a spectrum of autonomy based on how they promote their brand & how much effort they put into creating an independent infrastructure for their repo, if they create one at all
<triceratux>	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg
<omfgtora>	that is an awesome answer to that question
<baldfat>	triceratux: That is a good description till you get to Slackware and Geento and Arch :)
<triceratux>	np :)
<saymoo>	baldfat, good one ;)
<triceratux>	moooo
<saymoo>	And also triceratux
<ayecee>	you all get gold stars!
<saymoo>	can i have a different colour?
<Psi-Jack>	Sure, here's a pink star.
<compdoc>	he looks good in pink :/
<saymoo>	AAh, it's amaaaazhinggghhh
<Psi-Jack>	Funny thing, pink used to be a man's color as a faded masculine red, while women used to wear feminine blue. :)
<baldfat>	I want a pretty pony? Can I get one?
<saymoo>	no
<Psi-Jack>	Funny how things change over time. :)
<saymoo>	:P
<saymoo>	Psi-Jack, indeed.. people are weird
<saymoo>	or inconsistent
<saymoo>	i have no problem with the pink colour
<saymoo>	it's a colour ffs
<saymoo>	:)
<deniska>	or a color, if you are amercian
<GlenK>	gonna go with color then
<saymoo>	why do people invent a logic behind the colour like genetalia or sexual preference?
<baldfat>	so grey or gray
<saymoo>	i never understood that
<baldfat>	one is UK and one is US but which grey/gray to use in US?
<deniska>	because people
<GlenK>	because black gets you laid?
<saymoo>	technically black isn't a colo(u)r
<ayecee>	yes it is
<saymoo>	it has no light, so no colour, because to see a colour it needs light. (for visuals)
*	Psi-Jack sighs.
<ayecee>	citation needed
<saymoo>	that's what i've always have learned...
<peetaur2>	he's just quoting one of those things that teachers say to sound smart by proving something true that they then claim proves another thing false but really it's just semantics
<Psi-Jack>	^^ That.
<peetaur2>	logic error: "alternative theory is true, therefore original theory and all others are false"
<baldfat>	black is all the colors in paint and in light the abstance of all color
<peetaur2>	not the absense of all color... it's the absence of light
<peetaur2>	no light = black color
<saymoo>	oh well, many theories, none is right
<saymoo>	:)
<saymoo>	there problem solved
<saymoo>	aka the colour question is an ancient scientific debacle, that still has different views (as to if it's a color or not)... i learned one, you guys a different one appearantly.. (not saying mine is correct, just saying there are different theories)
<baldfat>	<--- Just learned that mixing paint in Kindergarten made black and the bathroom light turned off by my sister made the room black
<ayecee>	saymoo: you're pretty good at backpedaling. do you drive a unicycle?
<baldfat>	we need a new topic: Hey what do you guys think of SystemD (Just kdding please no!)
<Psi-Jack>	SystemD is awesome, and should be incorporated in every Linux distribution.
<saymoo>	ayecee, i drive two of them at once.. oh wait.. that more like a bicycle...
<baldfat>	Psi-Jack: Your (And Mine) wish basically came true
<saymoo>	but enough of that... systemd is next
<saymoo>	:)
<Psi-Jack>	baldfat: Almost. Though at least the majors are up. :)
<baldfat>	I still want a totally new Package Management System!
<saymoo>	a uniform one that exists on every distro...
<saymoo>	(besides a distro specific one)
<saymoo>	so devvers can pack for the uniform installer, or the specific one..
<bls>	sorry, that's one market RedHat hasn't been able to corner
<ayecee>	devver?
<baldfat>	I just can't see anything happening and most everyone jumping on board
<saymoo>	devver = developer
<ayecee>	who says that.
<ayecee>	honestly.
<bls>	duders say devver
<saymoo>	devver is used here all the time
<saymoo>	:)
<baldfat>	are there "Dude" developers that devver on anything but web?
<inthl>	having one unprivileged user say e.g. "max" and another one, e.g. "phil" - then max can not su to phil by entering his password. so executing `su phil` prompts for password, but fails; auth.log says pam_authenticate: Authentication failure - no more. but login via e.g. ssh max@host or phil@host works out. is there something I overlooked?
<bls>	inthl: what's your question?
<inthl>	...well it should be possible for max to do a su phil and become phil, shouldn't it?
<ayecee>	it should be possible, yes
<nrml1>	am I correct in assuming that dhclient only runs when executed by hand, if the interfaces file is set statically?
<ayecee>	i don't know why that wouldn't work.
<bls>	you could possibly have su disabled via a PAM policy
<ayecee>	nrml1: sounds reasonable
<ohcanada>	nrml1: provided there is no other network manager running, yes
<nrml1>	for some reason dhclient ran on my server even though its statically set
<nrml1>	weird
<toothe>	when I login via terminal, I get a message saying "You have X packages to update". But when I login via ssh, I don't get those messages. How do I recreate them?
<pylearner>	I need to read windows event logs through smb port 445
<nrml1>	I killed it and ifdown'd/ifup'd the interface and all is fine
<ohcanada>	nrml1: consider uninstalling dhclient if you truly don't need it
<ohcanada>	nrml1: but that could possibly spell disaster if a subnet is moved or renumbered or whatever, so having it around is always a good plan
<baldfat>	ohcanada: you clearified what i was going to say. i learned the hard way
<ohcanada>	a halfway house, is to use dpkg-repack to make a deb, and then install it if necessary
<nrml1>	ohcanada, yeah I think someone ran it by accident and then locked themselves out.
<nrml1>	I guess if it happens again I can dig deeper
<baldfat>	Confession: I have locked myself out of my server more than once
<Psi-Jack>	Heh
<Psi-Jack>	in over 20 years, I have never once locked myself out of my servers.
<nrml1>	Psi-Jack, hopefully you didn't just jinxed yourself lol
<nrml1>	These are VMs we give people and some aren't as skilled in linux as they think they are
<baldfat>	Psi-Jack: If you do would you confess?
<billy71>	So I currently manage my containers (lxc) by hand. Now when I make more apps to run on the infra/server, should I switch to something more automated?
<billy71>	I use puppet to have the containers created and wired up.
<billy71>	But now I got doubts - maybe should I use some exisitng PaaS solution?
<GlenK>	pretty sure I've locked myself out of many a machine simply by forgetting the password
<Psi-Jack>	baldfat: Yes.
<billy71>	Or just buy container instances?
<Psi-Jack>	nrml1: Didn't. I've always been just so accentrically careful in everything I do, especially in computers and servers. :)
<billy71>	anyone?
<Psi-Jack>	nrml1: Comes from being a conserving/holding type of person. :)
<Psi-Jack>	Rather, style,. :)
<Psi-Jack>	billy71: PaaS?
<billy71>	yes
<billy71>	host the app right on some apache or nodejs instance or whatever instance
<billy71>	less to worry about - but I guess the prices are higher
<Psi-Jack>	Heh
<Psi-Jack>	Do you have any actual Linux questions?
<billy71>	yes
<billy71>	I want the paas stuff being based on *nix.
<Psi-Jack>	Ahh, good. What are they?
<billy71>	I love linux!
<billy71>	I use debian mostly.
<Psi-Jack>	...
<Psi-Jack>	Good luck with your research. Please come back when you have actual Linux questions.
<billy71>	Psi-Jack: I got what you mean. :)
<Psi-Jack>	Mmhmm.. :)
<billy71>	mhhhh :/
<Psi-Jack>	But, I will say that chef can definitely do a bit more than what your puppet can, including spinning up and provisioning server instances to full completion.
<billy71>	Psi-Jack: but isn't this more a job of a ops tool?
<Psi-Jack>	salt can too, but the development cycle of salt can be a pain, such as, lack of good testing facilities.
<billy71>	I definitly plan to try out chef, too.
<billy71>	I am biased because I started with puppet.
<Psi-Jack>	I've used puppet, salt, chef, ansible, and a few others that need not be named ... ever.... again. :)
<Psi-Jack>	I resisted chef for a very long time. But I agreed to study it when I took a new job, and here I am loving the heck out of it.
<reisio>	this week :p
<Psi-Jack>	I still love salt. It's extremely nice, lightweight, python-based instead of ruby based.
<Psi-Jack>	But, I absolutely HATE puppet. :)
<billy71>	yes, the ruby based thing can be a pain
<Psi-Jack>	And always have.
<billy71>	I love puppet :/
<billy71>	damn, I am perverted
<billy71>	maybe because I don't know better stuff
<reisio>	salt's bad for you in excess
<baldfat>	Ruby Python they are basically the same beast for that stuff :)
<reisio>	can make a bad or good script in any language
<reisio>	but you can only make one that looks like the game of life in befunge
<reisio>	:D
<billy71>	better some devops, even with puppet or too much salt - that no devops at all :/
<baldfat>	right now I am trying to learn sml so I am out of my comfort zone
<reisio>	don't say devops
<Psi-Jack>	Heh, I'm actually, DevOps, myself these days. At least that's the department I'm in. LOL
<billy71>	reisio: devops devops devops devops devops devops :P
<super_mrwu>	....
<Psi-Jack>	but, not the same "devops" as stupid companies like Facebook and Google calls "devops".
<super_mrwu>	Psi-Jack: US military
<billy71>	who doesn't call it devops?
<Psi-Jack>	Depends on what YOU define as "DevOps"
<Psi-Jack>	Because everyone has it wrong. :p
<Psi-Jack>	For Facebook & Google, "DevOps" is both a systems engineer and developer at the same time, for crap pay.
<billy71>	ah, SML - I had to learn how to make augeas lenses (for d*v**ps)
<billy71>	augeas lenses use ML
<baldfat>	billy71: You are correct sir
<billy71>	hurra

<logan0405>	Hey can anyone help me to find out what window manager I see people using that looks like this: https://i.4cdn.org/g/1431096742720.png
<Psi-Jack>	logan0405: That appears to not be a window manager. :p
<logan0405>	really? how do they resize their windows into those shapes then?
<Walex>	logan0405: itn is a window manager, a really minimalistic one that I think can be operated entirely by the keyboard, but can't remember the name
<Psi-Jack>	logan0405: How, indeed.
<Walex>	also note the large white border.
<logan0405>	yeah its sexy i want it
<Psi-Jack>	Ewwww
<Psi-Jack>	Sick, disgusting, horrible, bleh! Makes me all enraged inside. :)
<CHVNX>	It's probably awesome, dwm, i3, etc
<Walex>	CHVNX: it is not a tiling one...
<CHVNX>	awesome can float,
<Psi-Jack>	CHVNX: Nope. It has window shadows.
<CHVNX>	Perhaps it's evilwm
<CHVNX>	Psi-Jack: compositing is done with third party applications.
<CHVNX>	compton, for example.
<CHVNX>	Honestly, it looks like any typical floating window manager with a border pixel size of 20+.
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<CHVNX>	Nothing fancy at all. Ugly, and non functional.
<Psi-Jack>	And fugly as heck.
<logan0405>	how is that ugly
<tenshi998>	hey guys, does anyone know if the amd r7 200 series work well on linux?
<CHVNX>	tenshi998: I bet google knows.
<Psi-Jack>	tenshi998: No, it doesn't.
<tenshi998>	I had a gtx 750 and the system woudln't even boot
<tenshi998>	I've already googled, didn't found a lot
<Psi-Jack>	tenshi998: Nvidia is the better choice for Linux, sad but true.
<ElectricTriangle>	Trying to use schedtool to set process affinity and I'm fairly certain it's not working, because gkrellm still shows the load spread out over all the cpu cores... "sudo schedtool -a 3,4 6065"
<tenshi998>	Psi-Jack, how so? because my gtx 750 wouldn't even boot on linux
<GinoMan>	testing testing
<GinoMan>	yes
<GinoMan>	finally
<CHVNX>	ERROR
<GinoMan>	ok
<CHVNX>	ERROR
<GinoMan>	Hey, any reason a touchscreen when touched would move the mouse cursor to that spot but not register any events on xev?
<Psi-Jack>	tenshi998: Did it boot at all otherwise?
<tenshi998>	yes, without the gpu everything worked
<Psi-Jack>	... What? Without the GPU?
<tenshi998>	it kept popping up that the nouveau drivers failed to load
<Psi-Jack>	You can't have a video card without a GPU. :p
<Psi-Jack>	tenshi998: So, use the nvidia propriatery drivers.
<tenshi998>	I mean with the integrated graphics
<baldfat>	Psi-Jack: Intel is the best choice for Linux :( It should be AMD
<Psi-Jack>	baldfat: I agree, /should/ be AMD.
<GinoMan>	I guess that's why Linus had strong words for Nvidia
<Psi-Jack>	But, AMD has YET to make ATI better.
<ElectricTriangle>	Sadly gaming on intel chips isn't as feasible :p
<tenshi998>	Psi-Jack how the hell do I install the prop. drivers if I can't even boot into the system?
<Psi-Jack>	Gaming? What's gaming? :p
<Psi-Jack>	tenshi998: You stop using X, install from console. Done.
<ElectricTriangle>	I dunno, I hearda this guy called Garth NewL.
<Psi-Jack>	Very freaking easy.
<baldfat>	Psi-Jack: My AMD card is great and the documentation for people to build a Linux Open Driver is best in class. No developers run AMD cards is my theory
<ElectricTriangle>	I must've been mistaken
<tenshi998>	anyway, I ordered a r7 250 and hope it works fine under linux
<baldfat>	tenshi998: What you say boot. Do you mean that you start the computer and NOTHING happens or is it that X.org fails?
<Psi-Jack>	tenshi998: It will work maybe "OK", but you will get crap performance out of it in the overall run.
<tenshi998>	X.org failed to load
<tenshi998>	nouveau drivers failed to load
<baldfat>	tenshi998: What distro are you workign with
<tenshi998>	all distros failed to load x.org with my gtx 750
<ElectricTriangle>	Psi-Jack: Based on hearsay or actual experience?
<baldfat>	tenshi998: Well maybe it is I am old. I would have it book like PsiJack said into console and work from there
<Psi-Jack>	ElectricTriangle: Actual experience.
<saymoo>	here it works (although it's an ti model)
<ElectricTriangle>	Guess it's all about relative performance though, since Linux GPU drivers all suck (save intel).
<saymoo>	but now i have the nvidia drivers (because of 3d)
<saymoo>	:)
<Psi-Jack>	Even intel drivers sometimes suck.
<tenshi998>	so my question is: does the amd r7 200 series work fine in linux? I don't want to go through this nvidia bullshit again
<ElectricTriangle>	Gads!
<baldfat>	ElectricTriangle: Gaming on Intel is 100% possible on Linux. Just not FPS draining games but..
<ElectricTriangle>	baldfat: I'm not talking indie here :p
<Psi-Jack>	tenshi998: ATI (now known as AMD), has had the /worst/ Linux support in all the history of Linux.
<baldfat>	tenshi998: There isn't an AMD card that "Doesn't Work" on Linux * FPS will be different
<baldfat>	Psi-Jack: But AMD has been the best company to the community and their documentation
<Psi-Jack>	baldfat: Only in the past 6 months. ;p
<tenshi998>	Psi-Jack, what? and an acquaintance of mine has a r9 270x and everything worked fine on his linux machine
<Psi-Jack>	And they're still falling WAAAY behind. :p
<baldfat>	Psi-Jack: Nah like 2 years :P
<ElectricTriangle>	The closed drivers will give you better FPS than the open ones (if they don't fail spectacularly for your card)
<tenshi998>	btw, I'm not planning to game on it
<ElectricTriangle>	which has been known to happen, I've heard
<tenshi998>	I just want it to eliminate the horrible screen tearing I'm getting
<Psi-Jack>	tenshi998: Then good luck! LOL
<Psi-Jack>	Heh
<baldfat>	tenshi998: I really want to run my R code through the GPU and well AMD isn't close on that one for me :(
<ElectricTriangle>	Huh? I thought anti-tearing was pretty easy to enable.
<tenshi998>	the r7 250 isn't even good enough for gaming
<tenshi998>	ElectricTriangle: so far only gnome and xfce4 are tearfree with compton running
<GinoMan>	tenshi998: enable "wait for vsync" it fixed it on my intel card on my laptop
<tenshi998>	but I'm still getting screen tearing with openbox and other window managers
<baldfat>	tenshi998: My kind of gaming works on my son's 6 year old netbook
<tenshi998>	GinoMan, where's that option?
<ElectricTriangle>	tenshi998: Ah, fair enough. I don't use tearfree types of features generally anyway due to gaming (unless I'm using Netflix or some such).
<baldfat>	tenshi998: Sounds like it is the driver issue. I prefer i3 maybe that wouldn't tear on you :)
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<Psi-Jack>	tenshi998: If you want to remove screen tearing issues, AMD is definitely not the answer.
<tenshi998>	I can't manage to install the intel hd graphic proprietary drivers
<baldfat>	^
<ElectricTriangle>	Psi-Jack: Actually I've done it fine with catalyst, but I can't vouch for the open drivers.
<Psi-Jack>	tenshi998: What distro?
<baldfat>	tenshi998: Why would you install Inter drivers?
<ElectricTriangle>	It's an FPS killer though, obviously
<tenshi998>	ElectricTriangle: what graphics card?
<baldfat>	I have good expereince with AMD closed source drivers
<Psi-Jack>	baldfat: There's mixed results with the experience. :)
<ElectricTriangle>	Radeon HD 79xx
<ElectricTriangle>	I don't remember the exact card number
<Psi-Jack>	Just try to get proper dual-screen support in AMD/ATI drivers.
<baldfat>	Radeon HD 78XX
<Psi-Jack>	Won't happen.
<GinoMan>	I'm sorry to interrupt but has anyone here ever configured a touchscreen to work with linux?
<baldfat>	Psi-Jack: I have triple screen on my box in the living room
<ElectricTriangle>	Psi-Jack: I do it through arandr, but I can make it work through catalyst as well
<baldfat>	<---- Using one right now
<GinoMan>	baldfat: did you have any issues or did it just work out of the box?
<tenshi998>	ElectricTriangle and BaldFat, did you experience any screen tearing with the closed source amd drivers?
<Psi-Jack>	What you end up getting is some bastardized resolution that spans accross both screens as if it were one, then things that depend on the screen resolution will fail and load things up in the middle between both monitors, or will span BOTH minitors at the same time.
<baldfat>	GinoMan:  I am using a all in one Dell crap computer with opensuse and it worked out o the box
<Psi-Jack>	ElectricTriangle: ^
<ElectricTriangle>	Psi-Jack: Window placement is a software issue.
<ElectricTriangle>	Although the multi-screen 'editor' in catalyst sucks. Arandr is better.
<Psi-Jack>	ElectricTriangle: To some extent, yes. To all no.
<baldfat>	tenshi998: I don't get tearing on my closed drivers (I don't push it at all really
<ElectricTriangle>	tenshi998: I don't get tearing if I enable vsync/tearfree
<tenshi998>	what window manager/ desktop environment?
<GinoMan>	baldfat: hmmmm. I can get the touchscreen to move the mouse, but it's not registering taps as clicks or even sending any events of any kind when used with xev
<ElectricTriangle>	little-to-none anyway
<ElectricTriangle>	tenshi998: Openbox
<baldfat>	tenshi998: me and ElectricTriangle also don't see over 25 FPS
<Psi-Jack>	Because the "resolution" claims to be, 2560 x 1024 -- The application can do wierd things, because.. AMD/ATI is doing weird things.
<ElectricTriangle>	baldfat: Eh? With or without featfree?
<tenshi998>	yeah, but I'm not planning to game on it
<baldfat>	GinoMan: whats the touch screen's company?
<ElectricTriangle>	Psi-Jack: Yeah, apps handle it very strangely.
<GinoMan>	EGalaxis
<Psi-Jack>	ElectricTriangle: Because ATI/AMD is doing stupid things. Not because the software is. ;)
<ElectricTriangle>	Only time I ever turn on multi-monitor is when I want to do something and watch internet video or some such
<ElectricTriangle>	Psi-Jack: I see no proof of that.
<GinoMan>	baldfat: lsusb: Bus 002 Device 003: ID 0eef:0001 D-WAV Scientific Co., Ltd eGalax TouchScreen
<tenshi998>	ehh... whatever, if I get bad experience with my new r7 250 I'll just RMA it and ask my money back
<ElectricTriangle>	But I don't like multi-monitor anyway
<ElectricTriangle>	tenshi998: It should work fine.
<Psi-Jack>	ElectricTriangle: The proof is so very obvious. :)
<tenshi998>	all right! :D
<tenshi998>	I just hate that I get screen tearing on DE/WM other than gnome and xfce
<baldfat>	GinoMan: well I am quiting work in 20 minutes so I am out soon. I would look at some big Google Fu and specifically see if there is anything from Geento sicne it is an odd company for touch anyways
<ElectricTriangle>	Psi-Jack: Whatever, I'm not trying to defend them or anything. Just suggesting that one bad experience isn't all experiences.
<ElectricTriangle>	Kinda like politics, what with the lesser evil.
<Psi-Jack>	ElectricTriangle: It's not one bad experience. It's been the popular consensus hear for as many years as I've been here. LOL, plus I've used quite a few AMD video cards. :)
<baldfat>	tenshi998: Wait you get no tearing in Gnome 3 or XFCE and you do in openbox? Then you my man have a config issue and dont need a new card.
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<ElectricTriangle>	Psi-Jack: I've never had any major issues with either of my two AMD cards, I must be a very lucky man.
<GinoMan>	I've been google-fu-ing for a while
<Psi-Jack>	Gnome and XFCE have compositing features.
<tenshi998>	baldfat, no it is the hardware. because I have vsync enabled in compton
<baldfat>	ElectricTriangle: You don't like multi monitor? I can't live without it, That is the main reason I don't own or work with laptops
<baldfat>	tenshi998: You can get that working with OpenBox also
<Psi-Jack>	openbox, you have to install compton or something to get that, to get the opengl required stuff to get that functionality.
<tenshi998>	and I failed to install the proprietary drivers for intel hd graphics so far
<ElectricTriangle>	baldfat: Nah, I'm fine with my one 20-something inch monitor.
<tenshi998>	baldfat: yes, but the point is: EVEN with compton vsync enabled I still get screen tearing
<Psi-Jack>	tenshi998: And as you are now, you're going to CONTINUE to get that. :p
<stupid-1>	 8-)  Gnome
<tenshi998>	oh c'
*	Psi-Jack chuckles.
<baldfat>	tenshi998: I would say you need to dig in a little bit more. If it works in any other wm/de it should work in any other wm/de
<tenshi998>	oh c'mon Psi-Jack this time I'll get tear free
<Psi-Jack>	...
<hayonj>	can anyone help me .... I can't get apache to resolve the page  tcp        0      0 :::80                       :::*                        LISTEN      2973/httpd
<Psi-Jack>	Throwing money at hardware doesn't fix proper configuration.
<baldfat>	lol Psi-Jack have fun
<tenshi998>	baldfat: I tried all options and I'm confident it's my gpu's issue
<ElectricTriangle>	Psi-Jack: So true.
<Psi-Jack>	tenshi998: Instead, just pay me, its about the same thing as throwing money away. :)
<tenshi998>	but whatever, if it doesn't work out I just return the card
<baldfat>	tenshi998: I think Psi-Jack is 100% right hardware never fixes config or software. We ahve both made that mistake
<ElectricTriangle>	Mistakes are learning experiences, so long as one doesn't keep beating their head on the same wall.
<tenshi998>	but I'm very confident it'll work out, an acquaintance of my has an AMD card too and runs linux with the closed source drivers, no screen tearing
<Psi-Jack>	tenshi998: Here's basically what you have said: "I can get Gnome and XFCE to go tear-free, but a very minimal window-manager I can't seem to get it to go tear-free, so I'm buying hardware to get the same results."
<baldfat>	Poll who has thrown new hardware into a machine to fix and issue and find it didn't fix anything? Than you spent an hour or two learned a ton and fixed the config issue?
<Psi-Jack>	So, good fracking luck. :)
<ElectricTriangle>	Well, tearfree heavily reduces tearing, but doesn't totally eliminate it.
<tenshi998>	Psi-Jack: I DID use a composition manager and tried every single config
<ElectricTriangle>	You do need a proper compositor for that.
<CHVNX>	tenshi998: which one?
<tenshi998>	compton
<}>	tenshi998, what do you need a compositor for?
<Psi-Jack>	You also need a window-managed that properly supports compositing.
<Psi-Jack>	window-manager. :)
<tenshi998>	openbox?
<Psi-Jack>	Does not support full compositoing.
<ElectricTriangle>	Psi-Jack: But muh openbox D:
<CHVNX>	Psi-Jack: Can you name a single window manager that doesn't support compositing? Hint: you can't.
<Psi-Jack>	CHVNX: OpenBox, fvwm, fvwm2, WindowMaker, Blackbox.
<CHVNX>	Psi-Jack: Those window amnager support window compositing.
<rattking>	fvwm95? hah
<ElectricTriangle>	I seem to recall that crunchbox actually uses some kind of compositor for openbox. What kind of voodoo magic that is I'll never know.
<Psi-Jack>	No, they don't. :)
<Psi-Jack>	IceWM too. :)
<}>	I had compositing enabled in awesome-wm somehow but I forgot
<}>	how I did it
<CHVNX>	It's not native to the application, but you can composit every and any window you open wilst using those window managers
<tenshi998>	ElectricTriangle, crunchbang simply used compton
<rattking>	compton maybe?
<ElectricTriangle>	tenshi998: Ah, is that right?
<Psi-Jack>	CHVNX: You can, but it's not quite the same as native. :)
<ElectricTriangle>	Neat
<CHVNX>	Psi-Jack: We're not talking about native support. We're talking about compositing.  Name a single window manager that cannot use compositing. Hint: you still can't.
<}>	oh I remember, I used xcompmgr
<Psi-Jack>	CHVNX: I already have.
<ElectricTriangle>	He's technically correct, the best kind of correct.
<CHVNX>	xcompmgr, compton, unagi, cairo-compmgr
<}>	tenshi998, I don't know what you're doing since I joined after you asked the question, try xcompmgr though if you need compositing
<tenshi998>	openbox doesn't support native composition but you can simply get compton to do it job
<CHVNX>	tenshi998: Yes, you can. Or, one of several other compositors.
*	} runs awesome in --no-argb mode 
*	CHVNX runs awesome with compton
<}>	CHVNX, what do you use it for? watching videos in the background or such?
<CHVNX>	}: what are you asking about?
<}>	CHVNX, I mean generally a compositor is not of much use in a twm
<CHVNX>	I use compton for shadows and transition fades.
<CHVNX>	Aesthetics.
<tenshi998>	it does if it eliminates screen tearing
<}>	So I was wondering aout your use case
<}>	oh
<Psi-Jack>	LOL
<CHVNX>	I never have screen etaring.
<tenshi998>	watching a movie with screen tearing is annoying as hell
<tenshi998>	CHVNX what WM/DE, graphics card and drivers?
<Psi-Jack>	Window shadows in a tiling window-manager... Makes no sense. Screentearing in a tiling-window manager, still makes no sense.
<}>	tenshi998, screen tearing sounds like bad video drivers or poor xorg.conf
<}>	tenshi998, I use awesome-wm with open source drivers and don't have tearing, ever
<}>	but if I use EXA I get screen tearing sometimes
<tenshi998>	okay, well another reason why I ordered a discrete GPU is because I can't find or install the proprietary drivers for intel hd graphics
<CHVNX>	Psi-Jack: It makes perfect sense if you know how to think and rationalize use-case scenarios. For example, not all tiling window managers tile edge-to-edge, and the useless gaps between windows look much more aesthetically pleasing with window shadows.
<Psi-Jack>	Heh, I get screen tearing on my MacBook Pro. :p
<baldfat>	tenshi998: Double check you have the right driver for the right chipset
<spreeuw>	Psi-Jack: radeon?
<CHVNX>	tenshi998: https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/13815/Intel-Graphics-Drivers-for-Linux-
<Psi-Jack>	spreeuw: No clue what the actual hardware is. I mean, it runs OS X and all. :p
<}>	I have to set "AccelMethod" to "glamor" in xorg.conf to avoid screen tearing, since it defaults to "EXA"
<spreeuw>	it was recently patched
<baldfat>	Psi-Jack: You get screen tearing because the Open Source gods hate all Macs
<CHVNX>	Check yoru repos. Probably xserver-xorg-video-intel ro some sort of variation of that.
<spreeuw>	oh osx nevermind, no support
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<Psi-Jack>	And actually, NVidia
<Psi-Jack>	NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M 512 MB
<baldfat>	lspci -vv
<Psi-Jack>	My home desktop has no screen tearing, has nicely kerned and tuned infinality fonts, and has an older Nvidia GTX 260.
<Psi-Jack>	And I run KDE to boot. :)
<}>	Does anyone know if booting with "acpi_osi=Linux acpi_enforce_resources=lax pcie_aspm=force" still makes any difference in terms of powersaving?
<}>	I think that was for old kernels but I'm not sure now
<Psi-Jack>	}: I may actually see if that helps my laptop at home.
<}>	Well I hope it works for you
<Psi-Jack>	Can always try. I have an older Toshiba Satellite, running newer Manjaro. :)
<CHVNX>	Manjaro? Learn how to Linux, pleb.
<Psi-Jack>	But, sleeping... Yeah, it WILL NOT sleep.
<Psi-Jack>	I can get it to hibernate, but actual sleeping in suspend mode, it pops right back out.
<}>	"I cannot conceive that anybody will require multiplications at the rate of 40,000 or even 4,000 per hour" -- F. H. Wales (1936)
<}>	heh
<CHVNX>	Psi-Jack: My ancient toshiba satellite 330CDS runs older Linux 2.6 kernels, i586.  What model do you have?
<Psi-Jack>	I forget exactly.
<Psi-Jack>	And it's powered down so I can't look at the moment.
<}>	I have an old eee pc running windows xp, might try putting linux on it
<}>	The only great thing about it is that the battery lasts for 7 hours
<CHVNX>	You should.  Those have atom processors, right?
<}>	yes
<CHVNX>	Debian, dude.
<Psi-Jack>	I have an ASUS EeePC that within 9 months started forming a big mass of black pixels, and ASUS Netbook support literally refused to RMA it.
<}>	CHVNX, why debian?
<CHVNX>	Are you some sort of savage?
<}>	grog the barbarian said I'm fairly cultured
<CHVNX>	Grognak the Barbarian*
<CHVNX>	If you spent as much time learning Debian as you do playing Fallout, perhaps you'd understand why Debian.
<}>	CHVNX, does debian have some special support for intel atom?
<CHVNX>	It just works.
<}>	I've used debian for a year, switched to arch
<}>	Yeah, if you saw the amount of problems I had that ##debian couldnt solve you wouldnt say "it just works"
<CHVNX>	PEBCAK
<}>	On a clean stable system with no weird repositories
<}>	It's one thing if you're making pebcak errors, it's another when the whole of ##debian has no clue how to fix it
<CHVNX>	If all of ##debian couldn't fix it, then it was probably pebcak
<}>	Perhaps, but so far I had no problem on arch despite all of the bad things I heard about it
<CHVNX>	Okay, who is paying you to lie to us?
<}>	Grognak the Barbarian
<}>	Oh, I had an actual question, is it normal to need udisks --detach to power off an external hdd even if its not mounted?
<}>	Because it keeps spinning even if nothing is mounted at all
<phogg>	}: sounds like a bug to me
<}>	oh
<phre4k>	hey, I want to buy a PC with AMD/nVidia GPU, put Linux on it and control it via CEC, is this possible?
<camulus>	anyone know a good PHP IDE

<bigsky>	what this of code means? http://pastie.org/10178472

<bigsky>	}: what awk "BEGIN {exit 0 }" means?
<}>	nothing that makes sense to me, but it should always return true for the if statement

<guampa>	someone knows a bit about elastix / hylafax? i'm trying to change the from address for mailed faxes to no avail
<guampa>	they're all sent with from: uucp@domain
<kerframil>	guampa: I haven't used it in a long time but that's probably because mail is spawned by the uucp user. search the scripts included with the package for "mail", "sendmail" or "$SENDMAIL" and see what comes up.
<kerframil>	guampa: it may actually have the option to specify a from address baked in
<kerframil>	guampa: possibly the notify script
<guampa>	thanks kerframil, i'm checking those then
<votlon>	Is using OpenSSH as a VPN a best practice, or should i just use openVPN?
<guampa>	votlon: not at all, as a VPN it is clunky and more of a curiosity than anything
<kerframil>	votlon: openssh isn't a vpn so I would not describe that as a best practice
<guampa>	OTOH it's rare that i need a VPN having SSH
<guampa>	well it certainly "can" do TUN/TAP VPNs
<guampa>	but it isn't really useful in practice
<votlon>	Hum... I just keep having problem after problem with openVPN T.T
<kerframil>	guampa: yes. it's fiddly and volatile as compared to openvpn.
<Psi-Jack>	votlon: It's only you then.
<votlon>	Psi-Jack: Well one of my main issues is that the inferfaces stop working with my bonding software whenever i install openvpn into the box
<Psi-Jack>	I use OpenVPN, very reliably.
<Psi-Jack>	votlon: So then, set it up properly. Bridge the bonds. :)
<votlon>	Psi-Jack: bridge the bonds? I think i'm misunderstanding what you ment by that
<Psi-Jack>	Are you trying to do L2 VPN, or L3 VPN?
<guampa>	woah you can do L2 with ovpn?
<Psi-Jack>	Yes
<votlon>	L2
<guampa>	that's cool
<Psi-Jack>	Then you need to bridge the bond device.
<votlon>	But tun0 hates me
<Psi-Jack>	Then tell openvpn to use the bridge, to which it will add tap devices for every connection to the bridge.
<votlon>	why it no work
<Psi-Jack>	votlon: You dont use tun with L2.
<Psi-Jack>	tun == L3, tap == L2
<votlon>	Me gusta
<votlon>	Brb
<Psi-Jack>	...
<pun84>	How do i configure snmpd to receive on both 161 and 162, it seems like I can only receive traps on 161 at the moment
<votlon>	Psi-Jack: .-. turned dev tun0 to dev tap0 and it worked instantly
<Psi-Jack>	Yep.
<Psi-Jack>	You also bridged the bonds, right?
<votlon>	Yup
<Psi-Jack>	Too easy. :0
<votlon>	Now for dhcp if i already have a dhcp server on the subnet i just put the pool to whatever the dhcp's pool is?
<votlon>	or does the openvpn server handle the ip adressing
<racho>	what is the preferred method to config ipsec tunnels these days? i recall fighting with racoon once? anything new in this domain?
<Psi-Jack>	openvpn handles the ip addressing.
<Psi-Jack>	racho: Not to do so at all. :)
<CuriousThinker>	Psi-Jack; do you use openvpn?
<Psi-Jack>	CuriousThinker: Are you under a rock or something?
<CuriousThinker>	Psi-Jack; yes
<votlon>	whats openvpn sounds difficult
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<racho>	Psi-Jack, really? i guess i have never really dug into openvpn
<CuriousThinker>	Psi-Jack; do you?
<Psi-Jack>	CuriousThinker: No, I just know a lot about it, and use it every day. :p
<Psi-Jack>	And just HELPED someone just now with a problem they just had. ;P
<CuriousThinker>	Psi-Jack; what makes openvpn so special, in your opinion?
<Psi-Jack>	It's simple, powerful, fast, and versatile.
<Psi-Jack>	And secure.
<CuriousThinker>	versatile?
<Psi-Jack>	Can do tap (L2), or tun (L3), versatile, can also assign static IP's based on certificate, can do certificate-only auth, cert + user/pass,etc
<Froolap>	and nobody else can understand it.
<Psi-Jack>	And it's very easy.
<rrman>	I copied /bin/sh to a normal user's home directory and set the SUID bits as root. Although when I run the copied sh as the normal user, It would give me the '$' sign not '#'. What am I supposed to do?
<Psi-Jack>	rrman: Stop doing stupid thing.
<rrman>	I just want to learn suid!! ;)
<}>	why did you copy /bin/sh to /home
*	} is confuse
<Psi-Jack>	ls -l ${HOME}/sh
<rrman>	Just to keep the original one safe
*	Psi-Jack waits.
<CuriousThinker>	Psi-Jack; OpenVPN is secure, but on a moderate level
<Psi-Jack>	CuriousThinker: No, on a very serious level.
<rrman>	Psi-Jack, It gives the rwxs for owner (root)
<CuriousThinker>	Psi-Jack; it has been penetrated brutally many times before
<Psi-Jack>	CuriousThinker: Proof?
<CuriousThinker>	http://zerosecurity.org/2012/06/openvpn-hacked-and-defaced
<CuriousThinker>	http://news.softpedia.com/news/Hackers-Deface-OpenVPN-Website-275039.shtml
<CuriousThinker>	it was not done by "hackers" but a hacker.
<kerframil>	what the hell has website defacement got to do with the security of openvpn itself?
<Psi-Jack>	CuriousThinker: First link has absolutely no useful data as proof.
<}>	CuriousThinker, they hacked the website, thats it
<kerframil>	lamp hacks are two a penny
<Psi-Jack>	And openvpn's website != openvpn software.
<}>	CuriousThinker, do you not understand the difference
<reisio>	you can use it via ssh, right?
<reisio>	should be as secure as you want it
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<Psi-Jack>	Proof invalidated.

<reisio>	https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/automatic-updates.html
<Psi-Jack>	Because they INSISTED on patching.
<racho>	Fahrradkette, i don't know 100% what is the name of the right package. all i know is debian has this fetish to strip out source/symbols into *dev packages
<reisio>	rattking: mostly, yup
<toothe>	reisio: Know how that's done? L-(
<toothe>	oh, you linked me.
<reisio>	toothe: #ubuntu-server might know better
<Psi-Jack>	rattking: Since they were modifying Firefox with their own patches, it was no longer Firefox, and thus, their name and logo were being compromised.
<reisio>	yeah they were making Firefox better
<toothe>	thanks!
<reisio>	Mozilla prefers it to suck just the way they like
<Psi-Jack>	heh.
<Psi-Jack>	But, they didn't... Make it better, or worse.. :p
<reisio>	sure they did
<rattking>	ohh. "At issue were modifications not approved by the Mozilla Foundation, when the name for the software remained the same"
<reisio>	anything built by someone not making crazy bins at upstream is better
<reisio>	it's not really that mozilla took issue with all the modifications, it's that they required approval of all modifications
<reisio>	and that delayed packaging
<reisio>	a lot
<reisio>	constantly
<Fahrradkette>	racho: to be fair, that kernel module was written for ubuntu, so it might just be some differences in between it and debian. I thought they were close enough to each others to have it not matter
<reisio>	why they needed to rename it iceweasel is another matter
<Fahrradkette>	https://github.com/ambrosa/A867_kernel_3.0.0.git is the one I'm trying to get built
<reisio>	on Gentoo you can just opt out and get the trunk/aurora branding
<reisio>	which IIRC features a globe icon without a fox on it, and not the word 'Firefox'
*	reisio shrugs
<reisio>	Debian likes to overcomplicate things, I feel, more and more
<reisio>	and they don't have hpn-ssh, wtf is that all about
<reisio>	like 20-30 more patches than other distros to openssh, that can't possibly make it not less secure...
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<billy71>	reisio: #devuan !
<Fahrradkette>	is that devuan still a thing?
<racho>	Fahrradkette, i'm sorry i can't help you with the package mess. debian is (as is ubuntu) full retard mode of stipping symbols/source from at least core packages
<racho>	Fahrradkette, maybe #debian can help
<naphtha>	Fahrradkette: probably too early to know for sure. i don't think they have released anything, yet.
<naphtha>	Fahrradkette: maybe #devuan can help =)
<Fahrradkette>	racho: thanks anyways, at least I now know what to ask {favourite search engine}
<balloonface>	with thin provisioned logical volumes, how can you get a sense of how much actual free space is left? Does the output of vgs or lvs change?
<Fahrradkette>	naphtha :)
<reisio>	billy71: I'm guessing devuan, like virtually all forked distros, is still about 2000% dependent on the distro it was forked from
<naphtha>	Fahrradkette: i'm so glad you said (favourite search engine) and didn't just use Google as a verb.
<Fahrradkette>	duckduckgo
<reisio>	quackquackwaddlewaddle
<racho>	btw what the heck is devuan?
<Fahrradkette>	debian w/o systemd
<naphtha>	reisio: in this case, with debian going full force into systemd, it'll be interesting to see how dependant devuan will be, or not be.
<naphtha>	racho: devuan is basically debian with initv, and not systemd.
<reisio>	systemd won't last
<racho>	so a fork of a debian...how many people are there?
<reisio>	they'll have to backpaddle out of it, just like libav
<Encapsulation>	screen -dmS myNewScreen /usr/bin/myFunApp
<Encapsulation>	how do I reattach?
<naphtha>	good info on devuan.org
<Encapsulation>	screen -r myNewScreen doesnt work
<reisio>	screen -d -r myNewScreen
<Encapsulation>	"no screen to be resumed
<reisio>	screen -list
<freeroute>	Encapsulation: you know, tmux 2.0 was released yesterday :)
<SunGod>	Hey guys I was wondering,is it wise to put grub lock on a VPS server,that you configure for a client in case they want to screw you over,hosted on digitalocean ?
<Elec_A>	Hello , I have ubuntu 12.04 installed.I want to install lastest Cmake, how can i do that ?
<spookah>	SunGod: how would the client screw you over?
<reisio>	Elec_A: by installing it
<freeroute>	SunGod: doesn't grub lock mean that you have to be physically there to type in a password at every boot?
<Elec_A>	reisio: you mean by running apt-get update ?
<reisio>	I don't see how they could screw you over, either
<reisio>	either you gave away your access or you didn't
<racho>	oh god that web page screems in my face...i guess the whole devuan thing is basically a handjob to SySV folks.
<reisio>	if you did, why did you
<reisio>	racho: mmm, handjobs
<reisio>	to sysv folks who can't set up sysv on their own 'cause they're babies
<SunGod>	spookah: they created the vps throu their digitaloceans account and asked me to configure it
<Elec_A>	reisio: or i have to compile it from source ?
<reisio>	SunGod: and?
<spookah>	SunGod: so why would you hold them hostage?
<Encapsulation>	got it
<SunGod>	and the have access to the web console
<SunGod>	they
<racho>	well in truth sysv was as retarded as systemd or openrc or upstart...or basically every other init system in the *nix world
<spookah>	you shouldn't even consider adding a lock
<reisio>	racho: right, but it's the status quo retard we know already
<reisio>	and since you can read logs in plain text with it, I'm going to say it's less retarded :p
<racho>	reisio, true...maybe the only compelling feature for the journald fiasco was signing but i doubt anyone had/can use it
<SunGod>	freeroute: i meant to say to grub protect editing the boot option or single user mode
<reisio>	pretty sure all the compelling features are already implemented in previously existing implementations at this point
<freeroute>	SunGod: I see, I had no clue it could do that
<Psi-Jack>	SunGod: Are you under a contract? Yes/No?
<SunGod>	psi-jack:not under signed contract
<Psi-Jack>	Then no work.
<Psi-Jack>	Done, case solved.
<racho>	reisio, i don't agree. sysv is bug ridden once you step outside of its domain. systemd is retarded but for what i have used it it didn't just gave up right away
<reisio>	give up?
<reisio>	I feel like someone should hold Poettering down and tattoo 'NIH' on his forehead
*	reisio absolves himself of spreading this idea instantly
<racho>	reisio, oh he had the NIH tatooted on him long before systemd
<reisio>	no I mean he should have an actual tattoo
<reisio>	so people can see him coming
<reisio>	people who somehow can't see that he's a goof just by his appearance
<kichuku>	 I need a quick help. How do I set up a cron function to shutdown the machine at 02:20 hours each day? I did a       │ alorenzi
*	reisio attacks the man
<kichuku>	              │                   | "crontab -e -u root" and then added the line "30 2 * * * /sbin/shutdown now" But this doesn't work
<koala_man>	what do the │s mean?
<reisio>	pastefail
<reisio>	kichuku: 'shutdown now' works as root?
<ceil>	doesn't shutdown need options?
<ceil>	like, -Ph
<reisio>	you're robbing him of a learning experience :p
<}>	who uses shutdown anyway?
<}>	poweroff all the way
<ceil>	lol
<reisio>	who shuts computers down
<ceil>	reisio: that's the real question
*	racho chuckles
<reisio>	it diminishes their lifespan
<}>	reisio, terrorists
<reisio>	damnéd terrorists
<reisio>	why can't they just stop terrorizing people
<}>	and computers*
<reisio>	I'm not sure they get it anyway
<reisio>	assuming the people who were responsible for airplanes into towers are 'terrorists', they aren't doing a very good job
<reisio>	my very first reaction was basically "wow, someone is begging to be killed by the US military"
<}>	They're already dead
<}>	How can they be killed
<reisio>	they're neck deep in virgins now, I bet
<reisio>	hope they brought some wet wipes
<reisio>	sounds messy
<ceil>	lol
<reisio>	maybe that's what hell is like
<naphtha>	c'mon, you don't really think it was TeRoRiStS do you? :/
<reisio>	a harem of virgins, and nothing to clean up with
<reisio>	there's no such thing as terrorism, for the most part
<reisio>	when you scare a child for fun, that's terrorism
<reisio>	when you smack them for murdering your hamster, that is not
<naphtha>	hah. =)
<reisio>	I put invading other countries into the hamster murdering column
<naphtha>	i remember buying FireFly GIJoe figure, who's description was, "A terrorists for Cobra." I don't think we'll ever have those kinds of toys anymore.
<reisio>	I mean you could say they're terrorising whether they do it for some greater reason or not
<reisio>	it's just pointless to say that
<reisio>	you can have them, but can't take them on an airplane
<reisio>	or your shoes
<reisio>	unless you're a child
<reisio>	it's impossible to smuggle explosives in _small_ shoes, you see
<reisio>	IMPOSSIBLE
<}>	reisio, what do you mean there's no such thing as terrorism?
<reisio>	so kids can keep their shoes on
<}>	"the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims" , seems fairly common
<reisio>	not as common as how most people use it, though
<reisio>	just a buzzword for guerilla warfare
<reisio>	which is just a buzzphrase for war
<ayecee>	the word has a lot of emotional baggage that is not specifically connected to its meaning
<reisio>	yarp
<SporkWitch>	the main problem is overuse and selective use
<reisio>	terrosism is to war as cloud is to the idea of abstracted hardware
<SporkWitch>	perpetrator was group X? terrorism.  perpetrator was group Y?  random psycho
<reisio>	terrorririsismsm
<reisio>	SporkWitch: heh
<ayecee>	the main problem is that even correct usage drags in the big suitcase of emotions.
<SporkWitch>	reisio: it's true.  even when both were technically terrorist acts, by definition.
<reisio>	the main problem is the UK :D
<SporkWitch>	ayecee: these days, yes.
<reisio>	SporkWitch: yeah I don't disagree
<reisio>	silly word, people shouldn't use it in serious discussion
<reisio>	luckily we don't have any of that on the news anymore :D
<}>	Well, I think terrorism is a word mainly used by americans, I don't really ever hear it in non U.S. media
<}>	Unless it's in a joke or tongue in cheek
<ayecee>	it sounds better with an american accent
<ayecee>	terr'ist
<reisio>	mmm, well it's an english word, and most native fluent english speakers are 'mericans, so...
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	I have a couple of questions aboutg: https://www.snip2code.com/Snippet/298431/Vmdeboostrap-for-virtualbox
<reisio>	MouseTheLuckyDog: prove it
<ayecee>	huh. is that true? i've never considered the demographics like that.
<reisio>	IIRC, yup
<reisio>	llloottt of people in the USA
<reisio>	not nearly as many in the UK
<}>	reisio, ayecee its not an english word
<}>	but ok
<reisio>	sure it is
<reisio>	it's just not from an english word :)
<}>	terrorisme is french
<reisio>	the french really did a number on english
<ayecee>	pfft. there's a whole extra e there.
<reisio>	consider the etymology of 'ampersand'
<ayecee>	and it sounds nothing like terrorism.
<ayecee>	it sounds all arrogant and stuck up.
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	The first is if I have a line like A=aaa B=bbb C=ccc  command, then command runs in an environment where A=aaa, B=bbb, aned C=ccc?
<racho>	and all boils down to latin...i guess the real terrorists are the huns
<reisio>	hunds ftw
<racho>	or the mongols maybe
<reisio>	huns, tooz
<ayecee>	MouseTheLuckyDog: yes
<reisio>	or mongolians
<}>	the golden horde
<}>	they did some bad stuff
<racho>	golden horde ftw
<reisio>	the UK did more
<racho>	chengis khan ftw
<reisio>	but they were in power in a more technologically horrific time, so
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	The second is what is the purpose of the first line in that script? Shouldn't it have either an export or aocntinuation mark?
<ayecee>	MouseTheLuckyDog: why?
<votlon>	tls1.2 is still structured as x.509 right?
<ayecee>	MouseTheLuckyDog: the purpose of the first line is to set environment variables in the current shell.
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	ayecee. it seems to me that without either the  variables are set then go out of scope before the second line.
<ayecee>	MouseTheLuckyDog: they're not used in the second line.
<}>	reisio, the Achaemenid empire is interesting as well
<reisio>	yarp
<reisio>	empires are fun
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	ayecee, it looks to me like thbey are not used at all.
*	reisio afks a wee
<ayecee>	MouseTheLuckyDog: if that's the entire script, you may be right.
<ayecee>	MouseTheLuckyDog: they don't go "out of scope" until the end of the function, though.
<ayecee>	they're just not passed to subprocesses.
<Encapsulation>	@reboot /home/pi/start.sh why does this command not seem to run on boot?
<Encapsulation>	its in sudo contab -e
<ayecee>	Encapsulation: probably environment.
<}>	Encapsulation, just use systemd
<}>	seriously
<ayecee>	once upon a time, cron would email you any output from your cronjobs. now, since most users don't have local mail set up that way, you have to use &> /my/log.txt instead to find out what happened.
<ayecee>	}: uh, what?
<ayecee>	is there history here?
<xeon-enouf>	superboot: try links2 (no javascript, heh -- and typing 'test' in the go to url box makes links2 look for a file called test in $HOME dir here - the default search dir/ i think can be altered too, as well as d/l dir/) ..and stop using google, see dontbubble.us, and use duckduckgo.com or startpage/ixquick ;-)
<sheap>	is the Intel C600/X79 fake RAID? When I create a RAID device in BIOS shouldn't I only see one disk when doing fdisk?
<ayecee>	sheap: probably, and yes if it were hardware raid.
<GlenK>	ayecee: redhat-ish root always gets cron output
<GlenK>	to this day by my experience
<ayecee>	GlenK: where?
<GlenK>	ayecee: just run mutt or something.  local if you don't set it up otherwise
<sheap>	ayecee: okay, I see /dev/sda and /dev/sdb as well as the raid device /dev/md126 so I'm thinking it's fake raid
<duckey>	Hey, I am having trouble importing the pygame module. I downloaded and installed it, but the IDE I am using (pycharm) is not recognizing it!
<ayecee>	GlenK: so, by email, which most people don't set up. got it.

<woodennails>	evening guys
<}>	Encapsulation, also see this http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/109804/crontabs-reboot-only-works-for-root
<woodennails>	Just installed Linux, specifically Arch tonight, and wondering how I go about sorting my drives/folders, I have everything installed to my SSD at the minute and my other internal HD's are just sitting there... what would you guys reccomend? I will be storing my videos pictures etc on this other hard drive
<}>	Encapsulation, as that link points out " there are also some use cases where it simply won't work, specifically if you do a shutdown/boot", depending on the exact cron you use and etc
<naphtha>	} <-- that's because he wears braces.
<naphtha>	heh. brace-face.
<}>	naphtha, ?
<naphtha>	}, ?
<naphtha>	you forgot to type a question?
<}>	naphtha, you wrote my nick and I didnt understand why
<naphtha>	} duckey was commenting on your awesome nick. the {}'s are called braces, so, it was a joke that you have braces.
<jsxoje>	HI.. I can't setup ssh to format sdhc
<jsxoje>	is it risk: http://askubuntu.com/questions/197459/how-to-fix-sudo-unable-to-open-read-only-file-system ?
<duckey>	naphtha, hahahahahahahaha
<jsxoje>	please
<jsxoje>	i can read files just can't transsfer
*	duckey laughs sarcastically
<duckey>	FTP
<duckey>	YAH
<naphtha>	}: not laughing at your expense, though. i rather like you. i hope it was not in bad taste. ifso, i appologize.
<ohcanada>	woodennails: well one way is to create a mountpoint in /mnt. maybe /mnt/data, and mount your other drive there
<}>	naphtha, (´･ω･`)
<Remram>	I think I found a bug where ptrace(PTRACE_GETREGS) doesn't return the right orig_eax after a successful execve
<jsxoje>	please
<ohcanada>	woodennails: to make it accessible to your regular user, you will have to chown it, or whatever
<naphtha>	}: \u001B[2J
<Remram>	only actually happens when I'm running user-mode Linux though
<jsxoje>	} :
<}>	jsxoje, ?
<jsxoje>	help
<jsxoje>	my raspberry pi become fsck enemy
<jsxoje>	now i cant ssh and transfer
<}>	jsxoje, you can connect to your PI, can read files, but cant transfer them?
<jsxoje>	i cant connect to my PI
<jsxoje>	sorry
<jsxoje>	its all read mode
<jsxoje>	something fsck
<ohcanada>	Remram: user mode linux is not really regular vanilla linux where register behaviour can be relied on, is the short answer
<ohcanada>	eax is the main register in x86, and is used for just about everything, so it is no surprise that user mode linux often reserves it for its own use
<jsxoje>	acculmator :D
<jsxoje>	Please ^^
<reisio>	"The default is the setting used last." you're so classy, Microsoft
<reisio>	that makes perfect logical sense
<reisio>	absolutely perfect
<}>	reisio, ?
<jsxoje>	O_O
<jsxoje>	All I asked if is safe to do it? http://askubuntu.com/questions/197459/how-to-fix-sudo-unable-to-open-read-only-file-system
<reisio>	jsxoje: to do what?
<jsxoje>	to fix the read only...
<jsxoje>	it my raspberry pi is only read only mode
<Remram>	ohcanada: so what, I just can't ptrace in UML?
<reisio>	jsxoje: to do what?
<Remram>	strace(1) works fine so I must be missing something
<}>	jsxoje, that depends, why is it read only? do you mount it read only or it detected an error?
<jsxoje>	I just want to have write mode so i can change /etc/network/interfaces..
<Remram>	but like there are these weird cases where a non-leader thread calls execve
<Remram>	another thread returns from a syscall it didn't start, and it doesn't even have the right syscall number
<reisio>	jsxoje: complete statements would help you
<jsxoje>	I don't think you can help sir.
<reisio>	I know I can't, I don't know what you want
<jsxoje>	Don;t help me it's stupid im trying
<Encapsulation>	I'm here
<reisio>	nice
<jsxoje>	He came to all my channels
<reisio>	who did, Encapsulation?
<jsxoje>	He is spamming #raspberrypi and make fun of me, soon I'm get ban.
<jsxoje>	Probably people  right this freenode not for me.
<reisio>	won't be different in any other public forum
<Encapsulation>	I was already here
<Encapsulation>	lol reisio
<reisio>	LOLOLZ
<}>	reisio, are you alright?
<Remram>	at this point I could just dig into strace's sources
<Remram>	https://github.com/ViDA-NYU/reprozip/issues/110
<pylearner>	ok i can connect and authenticate and query my windows server from linux is there a script that is tied to NETLOGON that allows for windows event log reading
<reisio>	}: not remotely
<pylearner>	im using smbclient
<pylearner>	has to be a way there is a java agent on the linux server that has the capability
<pylearner>	i am just curious to how this is doing it
<}>	reisio, is it because of windows
<reisio>	}: Windows is playing its part, sure
<toothe>	reisio: Ubuntu-server is dead :-(
<toothe>	#Ubuntu-Server
<reisio>	well it's a terrible choice for server, so that's no surprsie
<reisio>	and also no surprise
<reisio>	can ask #ubuntu, too
<reisio>	or #debian, but only if you play dumb, and jelly isn't around
*	jelly is always around
<Psi-Jack>	heh
*	} is afraid of jelly
*	rascul puts jelly on a sammich
<sllide>	so, my touchpad is randomly clicking and moving the mouse, it didnt do it when windows was installed on it, so i have no idea if its hardware or software related
<sllide>	is there some way to check this?
<john_f>	synaptic has sensitivity options for xorg.conf
<reisio>	sllide: turn the computer off, clean off your touchpad
<reisio>	turn it back on
<sllide>	reisio: tried that already
<reisio>	sllide: not real warm, is it?
<sllide>	not at all
<sllide>	john_f: ill check it out
<sllide>	i tried alot of xinput settings already tho
<sllide>	nothing seems to help
<sllide>	i have the feeling its software related tho, because when it starts jerking and i disable and enable the touchpad it stops
<sllide>	i guess that if it was something mechanicly wrong it would keep happening after i enable it again
<}>	sllide, does this happen on other distros?
<sllide>	no idea
<}>	I had some weird problems with my mouse due to powersaving, but not with touchpad
<}>	Since you mention it stops when you turn it on/off I thought it could be powersaving related
<}>	As in it starts power saving mode after X seconds
<sllide>	well it can happen in a few seconds after i used it
<sllide>	oh now it doesnt work at all anymore
<}>	but it works in windows?
<sllide>	yeah, it did
<sllide>	but i'm not sure because it only started happening after a few days in linux
<sllide>	no wait, it happened as soon as i installed linux, but its getting worse
*	CyberDems is now known as fragtion
<sllide>	}: i think i just fixed it
<}>	how?
<sllide>	well, it happened too when i shook my laptop
<sllide>	so i decided to shake it upside down and something fell out heh
<}>	...
<sllide>	didnt happen after that
<sllide>	yeah..
<sllide>	that stupid touchpad has openings on the side
<}>	and uh... you stick things in the openings?
<sllide>	ofcourse not
<dasabhi>	hello i am trying to cross compile a kernel and i am at a road block
<dasabhi>	any one here experienced with cross compilers?
<sllide>	thanks anyway!
<Kardos>	you're trying to compile a kernel with a kernel?
<dasabhi>	Kardos: no i am trying to cross compile a kernel for the rpi on my machine

<Streix>	}: bla bla
<pun84>	someone ban this shit head
<malaprop>	Streix: bla: command not found
<Streix>	all i asked help and you don't know how, ban me because your'e stupid.
<pun84>	on another note, does anyone know how to configure snmpd to accept on both 161 as well as 162
<Streix>	malaprop: looks who is here.
<pun84>	I can only accept traps on 161 it seems..
<Mac_Weber>	}: I see journalctl also started at my last boot, it does not keep anything from before
<Streix>	pun84: yes
<meznak>	Streix: nobody's helping because we have no idea what your problem is. go read that page, and come back.
<}>	Mac_Weber, that doesnt sound right
<}>	I have logs from many days ago in journalctl
<bazhang>	his hw is dead
<Streix>	meznak: i did just don't know what to go after.
<Mac_Weber>	}: maybe I'm doing it wrong? shall I just type "journalctl"?
<}>	Mac_Weber, yes
<Mac_Weber>	}: yes, it starts the log at the last boot time
<}>	hmm
<}>	Mac_Weber, do you have journalctl aliased to journalctl -b ?
<malaprop>	does systemd's journal have an issue with hard reboots?
<}>	I dont think so, I had shutdowns from empty battery and the logs are still there
<spreeuw>	it's lonely love you're dreamin of
<malaprop>	Thanks, }. It's been a while since I've used it.
<Mac_Weber>	}: I don't see any alias for journalctl
<}>	then I don't know, sorry Mac_Weber
<Mac_Weber>	}: thanks anyway
<}>	Mac_Weber, so the problem is that you get random freezes, even when not in X?
<UnderSampled>	I'm trying to grep .+ something, but it's not returning anything
<UnderSampled>	what am I doing wrong?
<Mac_Weber>	I'm always in X
<UnderSampled>	shouldn't .+ return anything that's not nothing?
<}>	UnderSampled, \+
<}>	.\+
<}>	+ matches '+'
<Mac_Weber>	do you guys know how to set the package "crash" for debugging?
<UnderSampled>	why, when * still acts the same way?
<reisio>	UnderSampled: egrep
<UnderSampled>	reisio: ah, okay
<stephen87>	anyone have any tips for speeding up grep?  im grepping through a few thousand files for a short string
<}>	stephen87, ag or platinum might be faster
<stephen87>	Mac_Weber: its not difficult.  its been a while since i set it up, but I imagine that your distro will have good step by step instructions
<reisio>	stephen87: probably want to use find to find more likely relevant files first
<reisio>	also you can use -m 1 to stop grepping once you match a single line, if that's all you need
<stephen87>	reisio: i already have a patten for the files to search in. and i dont know how many matches i need
<reisio>	find foo/ -type f -iname '*.txt' -exec egrep -il -m 1 bar {} \;
<}>	grep -F -l for fixed string
<reisio>	how can you not know how many matches you need?
<stephen87>	im grepping through logs for a process that has been running for around 6 months.  dunno how many entries it has in the log files
<}>	anyway your best bet is ag or platinum, it can be much faster than grep
<stephen87>	several thousand id imagine
<azizLIGHT>	my hdd light has been on for hours. how do ifigure out whats using it

<reisio>	much better thank you aziz
<utack>	is there a tool to plot ram usage of a task over time?
<utack>	probablly dump it with ps, something like cut and then gnuplot?
<JonathanD>	utack: sar
<reisio>	there's a tool to print an ascii robot & cat saying something
<utack>	will look into that, thanks
<reisio>	so yes, there's probably one for that, too
<utack>	and steamtrain, also a important tool
<}>	reisio, robot and cat?
<JonathanD>	utack: it already does what you want and a little cut action will help you right along.
<azizLIGHT>	gvfsd-metadata?
<reisio>	rfksay
<JonathanD>	utack: plus it stores it over time without any extra scripts.
<JonathanD>	Don't forget sl
<JonathanD>	Also, why do I not hav esar on my laptop!
<jelly>	because atop is nicer?
<reisio>	'cause you don't need it at all?
<}>	reisio, have you seen mine?
<wowaname>	ps
<wowaname>	anyway i'm crossposting this form efnet's #linux since they're idle

<wowaname>	help appreciated
<}>	reisio, yes
<JonathanD>	jelly: not for the question asked.
<jelly>	JonathanD: yes for the question asked.
<JonathanD>	I disagree, but ok :)
<reisio>	}: nope, let's see'm
<jelly>	well it doesn't draw nice graphs, but neither does sar
<Mac_Weber>	}: the default config is to not save log from past boots: http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/journald.conf.html
<Mac_Weber>	}:  I have to create the folder  /var/log/journal
<}>	Mac_Weber, I didnt know that, it's automatic on arch
<Mac_Weber>	}:  or change the config Storage=persistent
<JonathanD>	jelly: I'd say sar makes a more convenient data source from which to quickly extract data and draw graphs.
<}>	reisio, one moment, it's a bit shy
<JonathanD>	Nothing against atop, I use it as well.
<Mac_Weber>	}: I'm using debian

<utack>	very good, i got it running with "pidstat". thanks JonathanD
<davo>	hey, anyone had experience trying out "hackintosh" ?
<reisio>	some ones, yes

<davo>	yeah i know, but it must be 4am in #hackintosh -.-
<occupant>	davo: go to tonymacx86.com, read the buying guide and the forums. buying the right motherboard is much easier than trying to make it work with your existing random one in many cases.

<davo>	maybe the steps that i am trying are not necessary
<wowaname>	anyway brb

<reisio>	purdy
<dtcrshr>	hello everyone. I need to change the path on a script file, which has it in many lines. I wanted to use sed to to this, but as the normal syntax sed 's/thingtoreplace/replacetext/g' didnt worked with folder names, because of the slashes
<Remram>	It looks like a UML bug or something. When I'm not running UML, after execve, the main thread (tid==pid) returns with orig_eax == NR_EXECVE
<dtcrshr>	it would be something as sed 's//this/folder//that/folder//g'
<Psi-Jack>	dtcrshr: \/ for slashes
<Remram>	but under UML, the main thread returns with orig_eax == something else (like, the syscall it was actually in)
<dtcrshr>	is there a way to use sed to this or the slashes would crack
<dtcrshr>	hmm thanks Psi-Jack
<Psi-Jack>	dtcrshr: And it's directories, not folders. :p
<dtcrshr>	Psi-Jack: for all of them, or only the next to the s/ and /g ones?
<Psi-Jack>	All of them.
<}>	silly Psi-Jack you dont need \/
<Psi-Jack>	Or, don't use //s for sed, instead use ||.  like s|/this/dir|/that/dir|g
<}>	>sed 's+/thing/other+replace+g' <<< /thing/other/more
<reisio>	s@/@\@@
<dtcrshr>	oh ok.. thanks! sorry for the wrong names on folders / directories, I suffer form translation :(
<dtcrshr>	hmm the backslashes would be better
<Psi-Jack>	Eh?
<dtcrshr>	ill give a shot, thanks
<Psi-Jack>	No, |'s would be better, :p
<}>	+'s would be better
<Psi-Jack>	No, |'s!
<crazyhead42>	Hey guys, can I get a link to some line editor commands? My searches are not successful.
<heston>	so has anyone managed to get tinder working on linux?
<}>	! looks like |, l, i and 1!
<Remram>	crazyhead42: "line editor"?
<Psi-Jack>	crazyhead42: huh?
<reisio>	| is just plain unnatural :p
<crazyhead42>	I know, took me forever to figure out that one too. Apparently it's ex, ed, and somehow vi can pretend to be one?
<}>	crazyhead42, perhaps you just want to learn a bit of sed?
<}>	ex, ed and vi arent rally used anymore
<}>	s/rally/really
<crazyhead42>	Yeah, but my test requires "line editor" commands
<guampa>	yeah, nowadays people use vim
<crazyhead42>	so I have to read up on "line editor" commands
<ananke>	crazyhead42: perhaps you should tell us the actual goal
<}>	crazyhead42, man ed
<}>	but I don't know why you want to do this, it's pointless
<crazyhead42>	Pass my quiz on line editors
<crazyhead42>	Which I can do if I have the list of commands, but I've forgotten where it is and Google doesn't want to give me them.
<}>	if you have a quiz, you must have some form of book to read
<}>	crazyhead42, as I said, man ed or similair
<ananke>	crazyhead42: consult your study materials or your teacher/professor/TA/whomever
<crazyhead42>	shoot... I have to get out of the line editor first!
<}>	q
<}>	or :q
<crazyhead42>	Help!!! I don't know how to quit!
<}>	crazyhead42, press q you turtle
<crazyhead42>	:q worked
<crazyhead42>	q didn't
<guampa>	google "ed commands" and stop trolling
<}>	you dont need to google them, they're in the man page
<}>	literally "Commands in ed"
<}>	and vim Ex mode is still vastly superior to ed
<jelly>	ed is the standard editor.
*	jelly hides
<reisio>	ed is a guy bound for prison
<}>	reisio, what
<}>	reisio, how can you get rfksay if you're not on gentoo?
<}>	google just shows bsd and gentoo packages
<}>	http://robotfindskitten.org/download/ no linux :(
<SporkWitch>	people use ed? O.o  is there a particular reason? (honest question; what does it offer that something like vim or sublimetext doesn't?)
<annihilannic>	I would usually use 'ex' over 'ed'
<}>	SporkWitch, people still use all sords of weird old systems like HP-UX and might not have many editors avilable
<}>	and if they used ed for 10 years, then why the hell not I guess
<}>	like the people that still use ksh
<SporkWitch>	}: ok, but unless the admin deliberately removed it, they'd have vi.  so why ed?
<super_mrwu>	SporkWitch: just for convenience
<}>	Well I don't know man, apparently there's tests about ed in colleges if we are to believe the people in this channel
<SporkWitch>	also, while i don't think there's any policy, your "name" is stupid and annoying, please pick a real name >_<
<annihilannic>	ex/ed are better than vi for scripted editing
<super_mrwu>	annihilannic: agreed
<SporkWitch>	annihilannic: now we're getting somewhere :)  In what way?
<zapotah>	totally offtopic: single bracket as nick, wow
<annihilannic>	We have a channel regular called ] too, is that any better?  :-)
<zapotah>	hehe
<}>	SporkWitch, I didn't pick this name, I inherited it from my great great grandfather who was a tribal chieftan
<reisio>	}: dunno, but I am on gentoo
<SporkWitch>	(seriously, i am genuinely curious, because i'd always just kind of dismissed ed as something archaic from the days when we still had lights for each register)
<annihilannic>	SporkWitch: no dependency on a visual terminal
<zapotah>	i find it easier
<zapotah>	since irssi picks either the last "visible" nick or the first available nick when tab completing
<super_mrwu>	SporkWitch: when i want to do some batch editing, i consider using ed
<annihilannic>	SporkWitch: I mostly use it for crontab edits.. ssh lots-of-hosts 'echo "ex commands" | EDITOR=ex crontab -u user -e'
<SporkWitch>	that makes sense; hadn't considered that
<SporkWitch>	when i've needed to do batch edits it's usually been on a single file, just lots of similar lines, so i'd boot up vim and do a sub
<super_mrwu>	SporkWitch: i am using neovim, ya
<}>	use proper vim ya heretic
*	} throws rocks at super_mrwu 
*	SporkWitch isn't familiar with neovim
<}>	its a contemporary vim implementation that can be plugged into any editor
<}>	a.k.a pure evil made by heretics
<SporkWitch>	ah
<SporkWitch>	worse than emacs EviL mode? :P
<SporkWitch>	won't lie, if i found a better implemenation than vrapper for eclipse, i'd be really happy, for those occasions when i have to deal with java
<}>	technically neovim should be better than vim, but I can't be bothered to switch
<SporkWitch>	heh
<SporkWitch>	hard to toss aside all those plugins, and a config file you've spent years refining lol
<super_mrwu>	}: i just want them refactor the codebase
<}>	the config should work in neovim
<super_mrwu>	as Vim's codebase is awfil
<super_mrwu>	awful
<}>	super_mrwu, Did I tell you the vim codebase has 11 main functions and the entry point is 10 lines long
<}>	there's your fun fact for the day
<SporkWitch>	i dunno, my rant for the day is freakin' centos
<SporkWitch>	had my sysadmin practical today, used the same base image that i'd used for all my other work all semester, but for whatever reason it up and decided it didn't want to build python3 for me, even though i literally had the exact command sequence written down that i'd used when it worked before
<SporkWitch>	spent an hour fighting with it before giving up and just slapping together a half-assed script for the points, even though i had the full NICE script i'd written previously that i could have used
<}>	robotfindskitten: error while loading shared libraries: libncurses.so.5 :-(
<SporkWitch>	if it hadn't pulled that crap, i'd have literally had the scripting portion of the practical finished before AD finished installing on the winserver2k12 vm
<SporkWitch>	still walked away with a 105 out of 100, but it's the principle of the thing
<annihilannic>	SporkWitch: and you still haven't figured out why?
<SporkWitch>	annihilannic: timed practical, i gave up after the hour or so and started writing a new script to allow for troubleshooting it
<crazyhead42>	Okay, this is an online class with a generally absent teacher. The book only goes over the visual editor, but the quiz wants the line editor, and the list he provided is not sufficient. Is there a resource with line editor commands? I tried the -help and man files, but they only have the options, not the commands
<annihilannic>	SporkWitch: what does python3 do that the supplied python doesn't btw?
<annihilannic>	crazyhead42: which line editor?
<SporkWitch>	annihilannic: if it worked, that's all i had to do.  if it didn't, i still needed time to do other assignments (the practical was set up so there was the mandatory task of setting up AD, adding two users, and adding a win7 machine to the domain; that was 60 points, and then there were various other tasks, with different point weights.  you could pick and choose)
<}>	crazyhead42, man ed, go to the part that says "ed commands"
<crazyhead42>	Any will work so long as they aren't visual
<SporkWitch>	annihilannic: some improvements to argparse and the subprocess module, proper enum support, etc.
<crazyhead42>	It's not in here.
<SporkWitch>	annihilannic: it allowed me to write a much more elegant solution than python2.7 would have allowed
<annihilannic>	}: on this ubuntu system the 'man ed' page is as he described, however 'info Ed' (not sure why it's capitalised) does have all the commands
<}>	annihilannic, ubuntu is weird
<Umeaboy>	Hi! Anyone good at deep recover of an accidentally formatted external harddrive
<Umeaboy>	?
*	annihilannic hates being forced to use 'info' evilness
<SporkWitch>	annihilannic: and there was a really nice nameparser module someone had written and GPL'd that saved me the trouble of a LOT of the work parsing the csv input.
<SporkWitch>	annihilannic: but it doesn't work in 2.7
<}>	Umeaboy, just run ddrescue or photorec
<triceratux>	}: this posix version configures, makes, & executes on porteus slackware ftw http://robotfindskitten.org/download/POSIX/robotfindskitten-1.7320508.406.tar.gz
<annihilannic>	SporkWitch: I see
<Umeaboy>	}: Does it have a gui?
<}>	triceratux, oh so it's in the "POSIX" dir, I searched for "linux" and "gnu"
<}>	Umeaboy, ddrescue doesnt, never tried photorec
<SporkWitch>	annihilannic: that's what i ended up doing in the end, though, i just slapped together a simple 2.7 script that took a name and group as an argument (because that's all the write-up required, really) and created the account
<crazyhead42>	gah poop. It's going to take me frever to find my answers. Is there a man-formatted version of whatever } has on the internet?
<}>	crazyhead42, did you read annihilannic message? on ubuntu you need to run info ed
<SporkWitch>	so massively NOT what he meant, but luckily the prof likes me, and he knew what i'd done with my previous script (combined with the fact that he knew i helped almost everyone else with the scripting requirements on the earlier labs lol)
<Umeaboy>	I know wat day it happened so therefor I'd like to recover from that time if possible.
<SporkWitch>	so he gave it to me lol
<crazyhead42>	I am in info ed, but it's complex
<triceratux>	}: theres even a javascript version. no gentoo required. http://robotfindskitten.org/play/robotfindskitten/ looks like it runs on freebsd if you google some more :)
<annihilannic>	crazyhead42: or http://lmgtfy.com/?q=ed+commands&l=1
<crazyhead42>	and clearly unorganized
<crazyhead42>	Yes, like I didn't try as many versions of that as I could think of before hand
<}>	triceratux, my life is now complete
<Loshki>	crazyhead42: Ed was my first editor. What is it you need to do?
<annihilannic>	crazyhead42: what's missing from the first hit?
<triceratux>	}: thatz what this channel can do for you
<crazyhead42>	Welp, for starters I have to find an alternative way to " modify the word apple to orange on line 6" because apparently "6s/apple/orange/g" is wrong
<}>	triceratux, robot finds kitten should be installed by default on every distro
<crazyhead42>	figure out "what to type to stop editing" because '.' is wrong
<Umeaboy>	}: ddrescue: Ubuntu 15.04 doesn't have it.
<Umeaboy>	ddrescue.
<}>	Umeaboy, well I dont know about ubuntu man
<Umeaboy>	I'm using testdisk.
<Loshki>	6s/apple/orange/p works for me, fwiw...
<ayecee>	Umeaboy: 15.04 has ddrescue. the package is named gddrescue, like it's been for years.
<Loshki>	crazyhead42: i <newline> <text> <newline> . also works here
<crazyhead42>	That was my orriginal responce
<Loshki>	crazyhead42: well, does 6p <newline> s/apple/orange/p <newline> work?
<crazyhead42>	I don't get to use multiple lines!!!! *moan*
<pfred1>	ayecee I have ddrescue but no gddrescue
<crazyhead42>	I could have sworn there was an in-ex helpfile that I accessed last time
<ayecee>	pfred1: the binary is named ddrescue. the package is named gddrescue.
*	} has dd_rescue and ddrescue, no gddrescue
<}>	I mean in the repos
<annihilannic>	this ubuntu 14 has gddrescue in apt-cache search
<ayecee>	}: in the repos, it's named gddrescue, and it comes up fine for me.
<pfred1>	ayecee well that's dumb who thought that one up?
<}>	ayecee, I mean not on ubuntu
<}>	I wasn't clear
<ayecee>	}: ah
<ayecee>	pfred1: ddrescue package came first, i imagine.
<pfred1>	those frigging GNU people I swear!
<}>	pfred1, if you think thats bad, ddrescue and dd_rescue are unrelated
<annihilannic>	crazyhead42: what do you mean you don't get to use multiple lines?  what imposes that limitation?
<pfred1>	they just have to tack a G on everything, don't they?
<crazyhead42>	the test itself
<Umeaboy>	ayecee: Didn't know that as I didn't make this misstake before.
<annihilannic>	crazyhead42: can you 'printf "command\ncommand\netc\n" | ex somefile' for it to qualify as one line?
<ayecee>	pfred1: gnu didn't. they call it ddrescue. debian/ubuntu/etc call the package gddrescue.
<Umeaboy>	I just need to rescue some important data from it. I don't care what happens with the content after that.
<pfred1>	} sometimes i think the bit rot in Linux is past help
<}>	sometimes I think, but not often
<crazyhead42>	No, it's not that kind of thing. It's a fill in the blank and the computer will grade it for you kind of test
<pfred1>	ayecee wel lI just knew some dirty hippys were at fault
<ayecee>	dirty hippies everywhere.
<annihilannic>	I try to keep my brain in S4 state as much as possible to save power
<}>	ayecee, watch out, they're right behind you!
<crazyhead42>	isn't even well set up, I have to guess what the computer wants, spaces in perfect placement
<annihilannic>	crazyhead42: maybe it's only looking for the replace command itself then
<annihilannic>	crazyhead42: I hate tests like that
<pfred1>	I used ddrescue on a burnt CD here that I thought was messed up turns out it just had really screwy premissions

<stupid-1>	hi guys
<annihilannic>	crazyhead42: are you doing this test or are we?
<annihilannic>	crazyhead42: %p
<crazyhead42>	I found it. The answer was actually 1,$p
<annihilannic>	1,$ == %
<crazyhead42>	And it's not my fault the lesson doesn't give me the DESIRED answers!
<crazyhead42>	. is the command to stop editing
<annihilannic>	It is
<crazyhead42>	No other one is discussed
<storge>	everyone in here accepts paypal, crazyhead42 ...just sayin'
<stupid-1>	my opera web browser just got hack..  ijust had too re start...i like zorin 9...will there be a zorin 10..ill pay for some thing that works....??
<crazyhead42>	Have fun with paypall getting the rights to everything you sell.
<stupid-1>	ya
<stupid-1>	i hate paypal
<stupid-1>	its  a rip  off
<crazyhead42>	And you think I wanted you guys with me the whole time? What I wanted and what I kinda still want, is a list of comands for line editors
<storge>	i dislike paypal a lot, but i doubt recording acts would use paypal to sell albums if they gave up all their rights to paypal.
<crazyhead42>	That's what I initially asked for. Then you guys pushed for why I wanted it.
<crazyhead42>	And it's a new thing - they may just not have caught up
<storge>	now you're being pushed for money. so terrible in this channel!
<stupid-1>	master card and visa is my choice...we just live in the credit generation
<storge>	citation needed, but whatever. moving on...
<crazyhead42>	Joke's on them.
<stupid-1>	i have no cash,,,just creditt
<crazyhead42>	Oh, you want a citation? I can find it in a moment... just have to remember whose blog linked to it
<storge>	forget it, doesn't matter
<stupid-1>	i'm in love with linux for 12 years.. i just wont touch a windows machine
<stupid-1>	ill pay for linux
<crazyhead42>	You better be getting a good version
<stupid-1>	windows must die a painful death
<crazyhead42>	That we agree on
<storge>	huh?
<crazyhead42>	But I still need an alternative way into command mode in ex, and all I can find is vi
<guampa>	you know you won't practically "ever" need to use ex or ed in your life don't you?
<crazyhead42>	Yes, but this also affects my grade
<ayecee>	guampa: only if you use vi, i suppose.
<guampa>	i use vi and still use 5% of line mode i think
<guampa>	just search, replace, repeat and little more
<guampa>	oh wait repeat was in command mode
<}>	I can't stand the fact that gg won't jump to the top in vi :0 is just unnatural
<ayecee>	1g
<ayecee>	or is it 1G ?
<}>	And the fact that A doesn't allow you to remove chars, only append
<}>	1G
<crazyhead42>	Oh that's just mean! It wasn't asking for that at all! It wanted "q"!!!!
<ayecee>	crazyhead42: for the apples to oranges one?
<crazyhead42>	No, different one
<crazyhead42>	Is there a way to completely replace lines? I want to try that one on the apple to orange one.
<}>	crazyhead42, c
<crazyhead42>	Nope. "c orange" was not it.
<}>	thats not how it works
<guampa>	i guess using s/^.*$// or similar in a range that matches the line you want
<ananke>	the good news is that by helping crazyhead42 to get a better grade, we get more inept workers in the pool. so that improves our value
<crazyhead42>	It wouldn't be that complex. I'm supposed to be replacing "apple" with "orange".

<}>	some are even careless enough to upload it with their dotfiles got github
<}>	s/got/to
<SolitaryCipher>	yeah. That's my main reason for moving the location. I want my .vim/ and .zsh/ to not have personal information. I have those folders symlinked to the git repo
<}>	there was a guy who was busted for watching child porn due to uploading his bash_history to github
<SolitaryCipher>	ITs a mess. On my data harddrive I have configs/ and private-configs/ which contains private information and my irc client. I can get rid of the private one though
<SolitaryCipher>	wait, what?
<SolitaryCipher>	really?

<diegoviola>	I have a bunch of pictures in a directory, is there a way I can find the duplicated pictures based on the content and remove them?
<}>	diegoviola, fdupes
<ananke>	fdupes is great for finding identical files. if your 'pictures' differ in any way, such as jpeg metadata/etc, then it won't match them
<}>	theres a tool like fdupes that converts all the pictures to a 64x64 image and compares them to find dupes
<}>	but I forgot the name
<}>	i think its findimagedupes
<ayecee>	imagemagick's "compare" looks interesting, but i'm not sure how you'd use it to find dupes.
<reisio>	well, that'd be for finding '"dupes"'
<reisio>	like different variations on what is fundamentally the same image
<reisio>	the 300px copy of that lewd girl you saw online
<reisio>	the 900px copy, with altered hues
<reisio>	etc.
<}>	reisio, why would you alter the hues? she was perfect
<reisio>	ikr
<annihilannic>	diegoviola: another way to find exact matches only: find . -type f -exec md5sum {} + | sort -k 1,1 | uniq -D -w32
<}>	its best to compare by size first, so you dont always have to do a md5 comparison
<}>	like fdupes does
<reisio>	md5 is overkill
<diegoviola>	I still have a hard time understanding how md5sum can help with this
<reisio>	I'm sure fdupes does plenty inefficiently, but it's alright
<reisio>	it can help, but it's very much the wrong approach
<reisio>	diegoviola: they're not the exact same files?
<}>	diegoviola, huh?
<[R]>	reisio: you're overkill
<}>	diegoviola, if they're not exact same use findimagedupes as I said
<SporkWitch>	if all you're doing is looking for changes, md5 is fine; on modern hardware the time complexity is trivial
<}>	[R], Is there an official drinking game where we need to drink a shot every time you do that?
<[R]>	}: haha... i think you'd get drunk pretty fast...
<reisio>	so true
<reisio>	the time complexity is a life time
<[R]>	i did a 'thats what she said' the other day at work, and was told it doesnt' work
<diegoviola>	what confuses me about using md5sum for this is that md5sum creates random hashes for the same pictures/files, so how do you identify duplicates?
<[R]>	i said, you gotta carpet bomb them... a 10% success rate is fine
<diegoviola>	it's just confusing to me
<reisio>	it can't finish exactly when it's done, or it'd be less efficient, which btw it is already it's been replaced :p
<SporkWitch>	diegoaguilar: hashes are NOT random
<[R]>	diegoviola: the same file always has the same hash
<[R]>	diegoviola: thats the point
<SporkWitch>	^
<diegoviola>	[R]: oh?
<diegoviola>	right
<diegoviola>	LOL
<diegoviola>	what was I thinking
<[R]>	diegoviola: what use would it be if it was different every time?
<}>	if hashes were random, they would be just random data like $RANDOM, what would be the point of hashing at all
<[R]>	THINK MCFLY, THINK
<reisio>	anywayzzzzz https://www.google.com/search?q=linux%20find%20similar%20images
<diegoviola>	[R]: indeed
<diegoviola>	[R]: I wonder what I was thinking
*	} still reccomends findimagedupes
<pingfloyd>	diegoviola: note that md5sum is considered cryptographically weak
<SporkWitch>	diegoaguilar: so, i came into all this very late, what is your goal? what is it you're trying to do?
<pingfloyd>	go with sha512 if you can
<diegoviola>	pingfloyd: right, thanks :-)
<SporkWitch>	pingfloyd: depends on purpose.  if you're checking integrity, sure, if you're looking for dupes, md5 is still fine
<pingfloyd>	diegoviola: hopefully distributors will get the message more.
<pingfloyd>	I think they will with time
<pingfloyd>	SporkWitch: sure
<pingfloyd>	totally fine for dupe checking, there if anything, performance it probably your determining factor
<SporkWitch>	pingfloyd: only reason i say is because i thought i saw something about looking for duplicate files, but admittedly i came into the discussion late
<annihilannic>	for this purpose I'd be perfectly happy with cksum, but md5sum's a fair compromise
<SporkWitch>	pingfloyd: such is my thinking, yeah
<reisio>	it's also non-cryptographically pointless
<reisio>	as well as being cryptographically pointless
<reisio>	it's just pointless :D
<reisio>	but he wasn't looking for exact dupes anyway
<reisio>	</boringdiscussion>
<}>	reisio, you're a pointless
*	reisio cries
<[R]>	lol
<SporkWitch>	annihilannic: probably telling of how much i lean to the security side, but i've never actually used cksum lol; when i want to meet the goal that meets, i've always just defaulted to a singleton script that hashed two files and ran diff lol
<reisio>	wait, knew that already
<SporkWitch>	all this talk of points has me thinking pointers; pointers are sexy
<doge>	this probably isn't the right place to ask but i can't find anything on google, does anyone know the name of an ssh server that has a webclient? it recorded what you did and you can share the live terminal with others
<SporkWitch>	doge: nonsensical question
<annihilannic>	doge: not sure what the server has to do with it - are you basically asking for a web ssh client app?
<SporkWitch>	doge: do you want an ssh server that has a webGUI for configuration? or a web-based SSH client?
<doge>	it's a web-based ssh client
<SporkWitch>	then you already have it; what's the question?
<pingfloyd>	you sure its not tls?

<[R]>	you're tls
<[R]>	}: drink
*	} drinks
<}>	that's 2 so far
<SporkWitch>	pingfloyd: i think we both misread.  it sounds like he wants a web client that leaves a public log of everything you do... from his message: "it recorded what you did and you can share the live terminal with others"
<annihilannic>	doge: I would just use something within the ssh session to share it with others, tmux or screen or... there's something designed specifically for that purpose which I can't remember the name of
<doge>	i've found it, it was called GateOne
<ananke>	doge: start with http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web-based_SSH
<annihilannic>	doge: not the one I was thinking of, but...
<}>	isnt rm supposed to be fast?
<SporkWitch>	annihilannic: how high can you count? that's how many tools there are to share terminal sessions lol
<}>	this is taking awfully long
<[R]>	}: depends on what you are removing and the filesystem
<SporkWitch>	^
<}>	I have no idea what im removing
<}>	but its on ext4
<pingfloyd>	looks like an html5 based terminal emulator with ssh built in

<pingfloyd>	like the systemd of terminal emulators :)
<doge>	https://github.com/liftoff/GateOne
<doge>	pingfloyd: yup
<reisio>	}: try mkdir empty; rsync -a --delete empty/ somethingyoudontwant/; rmdir empty somethingyoudontwant
<SporkWitch>	under any proper filesystem, all it does is remove the entry for the FAT (or equivalent)
<annihilannic>	SporkWitch: in an extent-based fileysstem, it's not always that simple.
<pingfloyd>	i.e., removes indexes
<}>	it took 1 minutes 33 seconds to rm it according to my prompt
<kerframil>	doge: not a direct answer but may be of interest: https://asciinema.org/
<reisio>	33, that's barely anything you removed
<ayecee>	}: using an ssd with discard?
<reisio>	call me when you're deleting half a TB
<SporkWitch>	annihilannic: should be... it's journaling, sure, but it should still be a low-complexity operation
<}>	ayecee, no
<ayecee>	ok
<ananke>	unlinking is a non-zero resource/time/io consuming operation

<LinuxManDan>	What would be a better Linux distro for it?
<pingfloyd>	they're all more or less the same fundamentally
<LinuxManDan>	it is a broadcom bluetooth
<[R]>	throwing it in a trash compactor would probably be best for it
<pingfloyd>	distro choice might influence if they have a newer and better working driver for that though
<LinuxManDan>	Never toss it away.
<[R]>	its liek 10 years old
<}>	pingfloyd, a newer driver for 2005 era bluetooth chip?
<pingfloyd>	is bluetooth a huge loss?

<pingfloyd>	in that case, chuck it or live with it
<LinuxManDan>	Not really.  I can use without, but lookin to see if it is possible to use it.
<pingfloyd>	of course feel free to try things
<pingfloyd>	something that old, you're going to be on your own a lot
<LinuxManDan>	The pen works great, xournal works great for the writing, and I use the onboard keyboard as well when I have the computer in tablet mode.
<pingfloyd>	if you're happy enough
<pingfloyd>	wouldn't be worth the bother to me
<LinuxManDan>	I am quite happy.  Linux is MUCH better than the other OS that was on it.

<pingfloyd>	no, but it you still want to note the difference
<deego>	Why do I have to configure nscd.conf for hours to get something so simple and sensible: Don't keep looking up all hosts and everything else againd and again. But, if I service nscd restart, please do frehs lookups.  Am I missing some obvious alternative?
<kerframil>	deego: a simple alternative is to install unbound and use 127.0.0.1 as your resolver
<pingfloyd>	that's sound more like the ideal
<pingfloyd>	than just an alternative
<deego>	kerframil, pinkfloyd: thanks, I will go check it out
<pingfloyd>	deego: my thought would have been seeing if the ttl setting has any improvement, but you should try kerframil's suggestion first I think.

<sheap>	if I have Intel BIOS RAID, but have the actually RAID set up in Linux with mdadm, will the BIOS detect failed disks? or do the disks have to be managed by the Bios RAID for that to work?
<Psi-Jack>	Heh, Intel BIOS RAID? So... Fake rake.
<Psi-Jack>	fake raid, even,
<Psi-Jack>	Toss it, re-make it as a software raid. It'll save you in  the future.
<sheap>	Psi-Jack: yea
<Psi-Jack>	Rather... Don't use fakeraid, use pure mdraid.
<sheap>	Psi-Jack: that's what I did, I'm using mdadm to make/manage my RAID, but I was just wondering if the BIOS would detect a disk failure or would I have to go into Linux to check mdadm to see the disk status?
<Psi-Jack>	Fake raid gives you 0% benetifs.
*	Psi-Jack can't type tonight it seems.
<Psi-Jack>	mdraid can detect hardware problems faster than BIOS can in most cases anyway.
<sheap>	Psi-Jack: I don't mean that I want to switch over, just that if it is possible using mdadm for the BIOS to see disk status
<sheap>	individual disk status, not RAID status
<Psi-Jack>	Uhh.. D'uh?
<sheap>	haha okay juuuuuuuuuuust making sure
<Psi-Jack>	BIOS doesn't do much in regards to that regardless anyway.
<Psi-Jack>	What really matters is stuff like smartmontools.
<Psi-Jack>	And of course, proper monitoring. :)
<sheap>	Psi-Jack: for desktop machines and I don't believe anyone is doing monitoring on them besides the users (which are not capable of monitoring)
<Psi-Jack>	And?
<Psi-Jack>	What problem are you actually trying to solve here?
<sheap>	Psi-Jack: others want to be able to see if a disk failed and which disk specifically from the BIOS without logging into the OS when using the mdadm software RAID
<sheap>	is the question I've been asked
<Psi-Jack>	So, you don't actually have a Linux question?
<sheap>	I guess not
<freeroute>	http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/05/gpu-based-rootkit-and-keylogger-offer-superior-stealth-and-computing-power/ :(

<kerframil>	freeroute: assuming that all software provided by the repo (included the kernel) is bug-free and that it is configured, deployed and administered in a manner that is wholly resistant to exploits resulting in arbitrary code execution. that's the rub.
<kerframil>	as for click click, someone earlier was talking about people just piping code they don't understand straight from curl into a root bash shell. it seems to happen quite a lot nowadays.
<freeroute>	yeah for example with docker installer, but I'm not sure they still use it
<diegoviola>	wow, my Pictures directory went from 7.4G to 4.6G

<joules>	hi, I have a failed drive that was attached via mapping (dmsetup), dmsetup remove -f <device> doesn't seem to be working any tips? (fuser also shows no usage) I'm running 4.0.1
<pingfloyd>	joules: "Open devices cannot be removed except with older kernels that contain a version of device-mapper prior to 4.8.0. In this case the device will be deleted when its open_count drops to zero."  Maybe this is what is going on.
<pingfloyd>	nvm
<pingfloyd>	you're running 4.0.1
<joules>	dunno.
<LinuxManDan>	FYI I was able to get bluetooth workin by thinkin outa the box.
<pingfloyd>	what was the fix?
<joules>	I was wrong, though, it's mount point is showing lots (kworkers).
<mjbjr>	I'm rescuing a disk using e2fsck and it's going through the recovery asking "Free blocks count wrong for group #5793 (32768, counted=0). Fix<y>?" ... so I'm just holding down the 'y' key, but there are a huge number to reover, any way to tell it  do 'y' automatically at this point?
<pingfloyd>	mjbjr: usually with those prompts, if you're totally lost, you hit enter
<joules>	it's a program and it does a umount -l if it can't umount it safely.
<pingfloyd>	and then it chooses the default response
<joules>	So, umount -l is the reason I suspect.
<LinuxManDan>	I relaxed and remembered how picky XP was with it.  I put in my original XP HD, went and had it turned on and then shut down and put linux back it.  Aparently there is a switch that needs to tell it to turn on and Linux doesn't have it.
<pingfloyd>	joules: that would make a lot of sense
<joules>	yeh.
<joules>	So now what. :/
<mjbjr>	pingfloyd: the problem is that I've got to hit the key a million times
<kerframil>	mjbjr: -y (per the manpage)
<pingfloyd>	mjbjr: tape down enter?
<pingfloyd>	or put a rock on the enter key
<pingfloyd>	I mean what else can you do at that point?
<mjbjr>	kerframil: maybe that would've worked if I did it on the first request, but that doesn't work now
<pingfloyd>	are all the default answers 'y' though?
<joules>	hmm systemd Isn't helping.
<pingfloyd>	but it will probably achieve same result from the sounds of it
<kerframil>	mjbjr: are you using any other parameters?
<i5um41ru>	hi guys. I'd like to know where is the log file for any related DN
<mjbjr>	kerframil: no,just holding down the 'y' key at this point
<i5um41ru>	hi guys. I'd like to know where is the log file for any related DNS, Postfix, Dovecot
<kerframil>	mjbjr: I don't understand what you mean then. why can you not simply exit the tool and run it again with -y?
<pingfloyd>	i5um41ru: usually under /var/log
<pingfloyd>	sounds like the filesystem is pretty hosed anyway
<pingfloyd>	especially if you're having to answer that much
<mjbjr>	kerframil: yeah, that's a thought, but I'm thinking that doing that in the middle of a ongoing recovery might not be such a good idea.
<pingfloyd>	but I've had luck before
<i5um41ru>	pingfloyd: i'm trying to sending mail to another domain, i don't know is this related to postfix, bind9, or dovecot error. so i'd like to know the log information
<pingfloyd>	i5um41ru: is it a name resolution issue?
<mjbjr>	pingfloyd: yeah, it might by pretty hosed
<i5um41ru>	pingfloyd: what do you mean name resolution issue?
<kerframil>	mjbjr: I'm pretty sure the authors haven't forgotten to trap INT. repairing errors in the case of a heavily corrupted filesystem has risks either way.
<nitrix>	Yo, any DigitalOcean users out there?
<pingfloyd>	i5um41ru: in for a penny, in for a pound
<Loshki>	i5um41ru: start by running sendmail -v (or equivalent) and pastebin the trace...
<pclover>	is your question speicfic them to or general?
<pclover>	specific
<kerframil>	mjbjr: to put it another way, it doesn't seem likely that it would make a change then ask you if you were OK with it. at each prompt, it's proposing a change prior to making it.
<joules>	fuser -m <mountdir> shows 100s of pids :/
<pingfloyd>	I would think fsck would pick up where it left off
<pingfloyd>	I can't be completely sure though
<i5um41ru>	Loshki: i have no sendmail
<mjbjr>	kerframil: hmm
<pingfloyd>	that would be the sane behavior though
<i5um41ru>	Loshki: i installed postfix and dovecot on my system
<pingfloyd>	i5um41ru: are you having troubles sending it out or receiving?
<i5um41ru>	pingfloyd: for any account with the same domain, there is no problem. but for another domain i think both
<joules>	ok, everybody, I am a moron. tmux session opened in mount point!
<joules>	D:
<i5um41ru>	pingfloyd: but yesterday, receiving is okay, but not with sending.. and now both
<pingfloyd>	i5um41ru: have you tried doing a test message to the smtp host, you're having problem connecting to
<pingfloyd>	i5um41ru: you can telnet to it and directly make an email, that will often reveal where things may be breaking.
<kerframil>	pingfloyd: it'll just start from scratch, which is a fine. statefulness is not something you really want in a filesystem repair tool.
<i5um41ru>	pingfloyd: with telnet localhost 25?
<Loshki>	pingfloyd: some fsck operations only need to be done once (e.g. reconnecting lost files), but the checks probably have to happen every time it runs.
<joules>	anyone played with f2fs?
<pingfloyd>	yeah, I'm sure the checks need to be redone, it would be insane not to
<i5um41ru>	pingfloyd: but what to type at there after telnet on it, i only know "ehlo localhost"
*	joules is still looking for a universal filesystem that is supported by other OSs.
<pingfloyd>	the state is very likely to have changed at least a little, and you want to error on the side of caution with that anyway.
<pingfloyd>	i5um41ru: there's guides
<joules>	buy a usb flash disk and it's still braindead MS fat fs
<pingfloyd>	i5um41ru: it's a bunch of typing, but it's easy if you follow a decent guide
<pingfloyd>	but this may not be the way to go, depending the situation
<pingfloyd>	because telnet is clear text
<pingfloyd>	so bear that in mind
<reisio>	beer?
<spookah>	yes, pleaseres
<reisio>	joules: fat and ntfs are all supported by all OSes out of the box
<joules>	hehe beer
<pingfloyd>	i5um41ru: this really comes down to where you route your outgoing
<reisio>	course they're both awful :D
<pingfloyd>	smtp server on the affected domain
<DeLilleD>	How do I use a named pipe to send input to a netcat listener? I tried 'nc -l -p 4548 <in >out', but when I send something to the in pipe, it just shows up in netcat's stdout, instead of sending it through.
<joules>	reisio: Something a bit detached from any particular OS (thus universal).
<joules>	reisio: what fs can I mount under windows? :)
<joules>	or can't, whatever list is shorter! ;d
<reisio>	fat, ntfs
<reisio>	that's why people use fat
<reisio>	fat is old and awful, ntfs is just awful, which is really worse

<joules>	I just powered up win10 insider blah after dunno..windows 2000? ;d
<naphtha>	Bill is dead. we have a clone of him right now.
<mjbjr>	well, I have a pair of bent nose needle nose pliers, when put at the top of the keyboard it would hold down the 'y' key quite nicely without touching anything else   :)   ... system recovered... looks good so far... now for some rsyncing

<pingfloyd>	it's an authentication issue iow
<i5um41ru>	joules: yes
<joules>	hmm
<mjbjr>	naphtha: I wouldn't have thought of that
<pingfloyd>	i5um41ru: was that the NDR that came back?
<kerframil>	mjbjr: putting aside that e2fsck has a suitable option, refer also to man yes
<pingfloyd>	i5um41ru: if so, it sounds to me you're connecting okay and are running into an authentication/access issue
<mjbjr>	kerframil:  man yes... whoa                     thanks for the helo guys... off to do some recovery
<i5um41ru>	pingfloyd: NDR?? i don't know. so how to authenticate this..?
<pingfloyd>	non-delivery receipt
<i5um41ru>	pingfloyd: i just run $ telnet mail.linux.me 25
<pingfloyd>	that could be that they're not allow clear text and you'll have to test another way.
<pingfloyd>	you should find out what they expect for authentication and which ports.
<mjbjr>	kerframil: at that point it was too late, as soon as you hit the 'y' key it was off and running
<mjbjr>	thanks
<i5um41ru>	pingfloyd: btw, i'm able to send for local domain.
<i5um41ru>	pingfloyd: if i have to find out, what to check?
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: I read through the backlog and don't see your main.cf pastebinned. that might be a good place to start.
<pingfloyd>	i5um41ru: the remote hosts should be supplying that info
<i5um41ru>	kerframil: main.cf of my postfix?
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: yes
<i5um41ru>	pingfloyd: i'm still new for this..
<i5um41ru>	kerframil: wait me
<pingfloyd>	i5um41ru: np
<joules>	sweet
*	joules trys the faulty drive again.
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: also, in testing with telent, from which host are you testing? the same host that runs postfix, or some other host?
<kerframil>	telnet
<i5um41ru>	pingfloyd: whatis np?
<i5um41ru>	kerframil: here is http://pastie.org/10179070
<i5um41ru>	kerframil: i telnet from the same host.
<joules>	anyone using linux for a decade or more, get win10 and load in a vm and see how it hasn't changed. (administratively). even the icons are the same.
<freeroute>	i5um41ru: np = no problem
<reisio>	joules: wut?
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: try commenting mynetworks and instead setting: mynetworks_style = host
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: followed by a postfix reload
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: also, move permit_mynetworks so that it is in front of permit_sasl_authenticated
<DeLilleD>	How do I use a named pipe to send input to a netcat listener? I tried 'nc -l -p 4548 <in >out', but when I send something to the in pipe, it just shows up in netcat's stdout, instead of sending it through.
<i5um41ru>	kerframil: well, and how to test it?
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: test it in the same way that you did before
<i5um41ru>	kerframil: hey, now i receive notif from mail daemon if my mail couldn't send..
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: my theory is that postfix did not trust the local machine for relaying in the absence of authentication. hopefully, that has changed.
<i5um41ru>	here is the email from mail daemon http://pastie.org/10179082
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: in other words, you should be able to use telnet locally to deliver a message now. I can't see any other restrictions that would apply from glancing through your config.
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: well, that means exactly what it says. the name "server.linux.me.linux.me" doesn't exist. it will keep on trying to deliver for (by defalut) up to a week then eventually give up.
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: the name doesn't exist in DNS
<i5um41ru>	kerframil: so that, this related with DNS setting
<i5um41ru>	?
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: we're now discussing a different issue. can you please confirm whether the original issue is resolved or not.
<pingfloyd>	if you can't trust local, who can you trust?
<reisio>	the government
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: as I understand it, the issue was that you were not trusted to relay despite testing from the same host
<pingfloyd>	is that a default behavior with postfix?
<Rad->	Hi, can someone help me figure out why I have permission errors?
<Rad->	I'm following this: http://www.rainloop.net/docs/permissions/ and I get https://www.mixolydianmuse.com/mail/
<Rad->	unless i chmod -R 777
<kerframil>	pingfloyd: no, it shouldn't be. but, if a distro ships a config covering 127.0.0.0/8 that isn't necesarily enough.
<i5um41ru>	kerframil: well, first i'd like to say, my O
<kerframil>	pingfloyd: mynetworks_style is more convenient for the simple cases
*	root is now known as Guest9735
<i5um41ru>	kerframil: well, first i'd like to say, my OS is debian, and then setup two Vbox, both are ubuntu, after that, both Vbox configured each different domain (ubuntu.asia and linux.me). Also alreay set up mail server. I able to send/receive mail for each domain, but not to abroad.
<DeLilleD>	I'm getting some strange behavior with netcat and named pipes. When I set up a listener (nc -l -p 4548 <in) and a client (nc localhost 4548), sending something to pipe 'in' (echo a > in) makes it sometimes send it through to the client and sometimes just show up in the listeners stdout. Anyone have any idea why?
<adsjlkdk>	how can i leave top in the terminal
<adsjlkdk>	exit out of top
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: that's too vague for me to understand. "configured each different domain" could mean various things. for example, it could mean that you have separate postfix instances with a distinct "mydomain". also when you say "send/receive email for each" domain, that's not specific enough.
<ayecee>	adsjlkdk: q
<DeLilleD>	nevermind, I think I solved it
<i5um41ru>	kerframil: i'm sorry for my language
<adsjlkdk>	ayecee: it doesnt work
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: explain from where the smtp client is running, to which postfix instance it is communication, how, to whom and what the problem is. when given advice, provide feedback in turn. it's just easier that way.
<i5um41ru>	kerframil: btw here is my db.linux http://pastie.org/10179085
<ayecee>	adsjlkdk: then you're doing it wrong
<kerframil>	communicating
<i5um41ru>	kerframil: simply to say, i've setup two vbox with each has configured dns and mail server, does it clear?
<pingfloyd>	i5um41ru: so 2 vms running in vbox?
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: yes
<pingfloyd>	which networking mode?
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: btw, that zone you pasted doesn't seem to be public. `dig +short mail.ubuntu.asia` returns nothing for me.
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: even server1.ubuntu.asia does not resolve, making it impossible to query what's supposed to be the authoritative server (as conveyed by the SOA record)
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: that means that the rest of the world won't be able to look up the MX record and send any email destined to the domain
<i5um41ru>	pingfloyd: not, two vbox running each their own server
<pingfloyd>	so two hosts?
<i5um41ru>	kerframil: hey, now i able to send to another domain :)
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: good. that's progress, at least.
<i5um41ru>	pingfloyd: yes
<pingfloyd>	are they on the same lan?
<freeroute>	adsjlkdk: make sure caps lock is off
<adsjlkdk>	still doesnt work but thank you
<i5um41ru>	kerframil: i able to send mail from mark1@mail.ubuntu.asia to i8r4h1m@linux.me, now i'm trying reverse. from linux.me to ubuntu.asia
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: it's not going to work, for the reasons I've explained above
<Psi-Jack>	Heh. Kind of nice. I just got my administrative home cluster dokuwiki to backup it's data every change to my gitlab server's git repository.
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: there's more to making DNS work than just setting up BIND and creating a zone
<i5um41ru>	pingfloyd: i've already configured /etc/resolv.conf
<i5um41ru>	kerframil: i've already create the zone
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: I can see that
<i5um41ru>	kerframil: so, what else to do ?
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: I am at some random other part of the world. I run `dig +short ubunti.asia MX` and get no value for that record.
<freeroute>	Psi-Jack: so you're basically git adding, git commiting and pushing the changes to your gitlab repo after they happen?
<Psi-Jack>	freeroute: Yep, and the commit message includes who did it, what their update comment was, as well.
<i5um41ru>	kerframil: you dig domain ubuntu.asia and linux.me?
<freeroute>	interesting, I wonder if similar can be done with other websites
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: you have two options. 1) don't run a DNS server yourself and use your registrar tools to manage the records 2) make sure your registrar has implemented the necessary glue records so that *your* bind server is considered an authority for the ubuntu.asia and linux.me zones
<i5um41ru>	pingfloyd: yup, both are via lan, bridge connection with vbox
<Psi-Jack>	freeroute: This was a plugin for Dokuwiki, because Dokuwiki stores it's data on the filesystem.
<freeroute>	ah nice
<i5um41ru>	kerframil: i'm just experimenting with this, and also both are lan.
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: also, your address is nonsense "192.168.1.186". that's a non-routeable address. it won't work anywhere outside of your LAN.
*	Sarge123 is now known as Sarge123^off
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: ok
<freeroute>	Psi-Jack: does docuwiki have a different syntax than mediawiki?
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: if you expect a remote mta to be able to deliver to you, it must be able to look up - and get a response to - a query for the MX record. it must then be able to actually connect to the address given and be able to reach your postfix instance.
<pingfloyd>	and then there's the firewall likely and forwarding to the outside.
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	Ok. Given a list of files with a certain extension, how do I  change it to a list of files with a different extension?
<Psi-Jack>	freeroute: Yes. And can also support markdown
<freeroute>	very interesting
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	Ex: LIST=a.c b.c c.c NEWLIST=a.h b.h c.h
<Psi-Jack>	And because of this plugin, I can also pseudo replicate it to my other dokuwiki server. :D
<freeroute>	yeah if the database is only made up of text files then it becomes real easy
<Froolap>	mv *.fast *.slow
<MetaNova>	Froolap: that doesn't work
<Psi-Jack>	Heh, that wouldn't. :p
<kerframil>	pingfloyd: ubuntu.asia isn't even registered ...
<freeroute>	probably because they're not using ubuntu in asia
<i5um41ru>	kerframil: as so far, both vbox are able send/receive mail to each other. thanks a lot :).
<pingfloyd>	kerframil: is that an arbitrary name he chose for his private domain?
<MetaNova>	MouseTheLuckyDog: 'rename .c .h *.c'
<kerframil>	pingfloyd: that's the way it appears. and there seemed to be some expectation that he could now direct email inbound, though I'm not entirely certain of that.
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: if you intend to use that domain for a real-world setup, you should register it
<pingfloyd>	is this an issue with getting two smtp servers communicating on your local network?
<i5um41ru>	kerframil: no, i'm just experimenting with local domain, experimenting in setup mail server.. just it not more :)
<kerframil>	i5um41ru: ok
<pingfloyd>	or with an smtp server out on the internet?
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	MetaNova, I don't think so.
<Psi-Jack>	kerframil: Main difference in Dokuwiki and Mediawiki formats is that the header style is reversed. like MediaWiki uses 1 = for header 1, while Dokuwiki uses 6. A little confusing at first, but reading it raw, looks much better.
<MetaNova>	MouseTheLuckyDog: I just touched a.c, b.c, c.c, 'rename .c .h *.c' successfully converts them to a.h, b.h, and c.h
<xeon-enouf>	it's busy in here
<kerframil>	pingfloyd: I understood the original problem as being that he was using telnet on the host running postfix to try and send mail outbound (relaying), only for it to be denied the right.
*	xeon-enouf has to stop getting lost in scrollback.. sigh; oh kerframil; thanks for the info about config_x86_intel_pstate (from days ago)
<kerframil>	pingfloyd: I think that was because mynetwork wasn't broad enough and, possibly, also because permit_mynetworks wasn't in front of the other mechanisms used by the client restrictions directive
<pingfloyd>	kerframil: it's not very clear
<kerframil>	pingfloyd: that should have been resolved at least
<MetaNova>	MouseTheLuckyDog: for your example situation, that command works.
<xeon-enouf>	MouseTheLuckyDog: namei -xl `which rename`
<kerframil>	pingfloyd: I agree; the rest was less clear. none of this will work in a production context but he implies that he's learning/experimenting so ... ok, I guess.
<xeon-enouf>	does it point to prename?
<Swifftynob>	what is the most popular server os?
<Swifftynob>	really no one....
<ayecee>	Swifftynob: there's no reliable way to determine that.
<kerframil>	Swifftynob: it's probably not possible to give a definitive answer. it's very likely one of: Debian/Ubuntu/CentOS
<Swifftynob>	from professionally experience, what is the best distro to get comfortable with?
<Swifftynob>	if anyone has an opinion on that
<kerframil>	from my subjective observation, Ubuntu has been gaining traction in recent years (much to my chagrin)
<[R]>	everyone has an opinion
<[R]>	and there will be 50 differnet ones
<[R]>	just pick one you like
<pingfloyd>	Swifftynob: if it's for career, learn whatever is in high demand
<booboy_>	centos
<Swifftynob>	what about z/OS?
<pingfloyd>	and then learn what you like the most also
<[R]>	what the hell is z/os
<Swifftynob>	ibm's os
<xeon-enouf>	win2k8r2
<pingfloyd>	Swifftynob: is this a question of learning for career?
<[R]>	Swifftynob: this isn't ##linux... so...
<xeon-enouf>	power7+ uses 64kb pages
<Swifftynob>	i will be checking on centos on my vps probably, career/hobbyish lol
<pingfloyd>	why on a vps though?
<pingfloyd>	you should learn a pure distro first
<xeon-enouf>	zswap does even better if you use the builtin hardware accel on the chip
<pingfloyd>	then you can try to solve how the provider messed it up
<[R]>	ZEE SWAP
*	xeon-enouf ZEE RAMs [R] 
<diegoviola>	Sauvin [R], did you just say you wanted to be rammed with some zee?
<Swifftynob>	@pingfloyd, can you give an example? im pretty comfortable with ubuntu/debian
<xeon-enouf>	ever hear of Foreign Accent Syndrome? hahaha.. caused via car crashes; spontaneous french!
<pingfloyd>	Swifftynob: one of the main ones is a good place to start
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: hrm.. there was something i wanted to clarify/tell you ; that you'd been given some slightly incorrect info about, about a day or two ago -- can't recall your Q though
<Swifftynob>	i have no idea what the difference is between a pure distro and say debain/ubuntu
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: you signed off - so, i didn't post the info
<pingfloyd>	debian qualifies
<totesmuhgoats>	grepper: sorry, i didn't see the message you sent yesterday
<xeon-enouf>	Swifftynob: 3 majors; RH, Debian, Slack
<xeon-enouf>	all others are some fork, or.. thereabouts
<xeon-enouf>	aahh.. i keep forgetting about /msgserv, or whatever it is
<diegoviola>	xeon-enouf: ?
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: yes, that is the question ;-)
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: you queried in channel here about something; and IMHO, were given misinformation
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	MetaNova, syntax error at (user-supplied code), near "."
<diegoviola>	xeon-enouf: misinformation about? not sure what you're talking about
<Swifftynob>	soo something like Centos would be an okay starting point for RH?
<kerframil>	xeon-enouf: /msg memoserv help
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: what did you ask about?
<xeon-enouf>	kerframil: ahh yes! /memosrv!
<diegoviola>	xeon-enouf: I can't remember
<diegoviola>	xeon-enouf: I'll have to look at my logs
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: try harder :-)
<xeon-enouf>	do so
<diegoviola>	xeon-enouf: do you know what it was?
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: no - that's why i'm asking
<diegoviola>	xeon-enouf: about deduplicating files?
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	xeon-enouf, ?
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: i might still have it in backscroll ; but... sigh, 5000 lines of searching? gah -- i could dump to log, and grep i suppose
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: nope
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: definitely not the word "deduplicating"
<xeon-enouf>	MouseTheLuckyDog: ? ?
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: i would've recalled that word
<diegoviola>	xeon-enouf: acpi?
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	xeon-enouf, Why :  namei -xl `which rename`?
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: AHA!
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: ding ding!
<diegoviola>	logs are great, aren't they?
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: ok, so - if you disable ACPI entirely, you'll likely a) only have 1 CPU available (all others will be offline, even just cores/threads)
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: Power management (as mentioned) will be non-existant
<diegoviola>	xeon-enouf: interesting
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: and many more bad things... especially for mobile/laptopms
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: there are tons of various kernel-parameters.txt boot params that can be used to work around specific hardware issues;
<xeon-enouf>	using acpi=off, or noacpi, or whatever is like shooting a ICBM at a gnat :-)
<MouseTheLuckyDog>	xeon-enouf, you mean cores/hyperrthreads ?
<xeon-enouf>	no
<diegoviola>	xeon-enouf: interesting, I was wondering if you can get a increase in your electricity bill with broken ACPI or something similar, can a bug in the ACPI code make it so that your power supply consumes more energy for instance? or that's unrelated?
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: yes, since teh workload would be more constrained to limited resources, plus various Power saving features, (see Intel Pstate even) .. disks/monitor standby modes, etc etc...
<ayecee>	diegoviola: not your power supply per se, but yes
<xeon-enouf>	will be not available
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: so if your system has 4 cores/threads, and only 1 is operational, it needs to work harder, causing more heat, more energy to cool, etc etc
<diegoviola>	but doesn't most power supplies have a limit of how much electricity they can consume?
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: you can even live-test this, by offlining CPUs, (hotplugging)
<xeon-enouf>	and even now, there's a much better way to do so, that i can't recall offhand
<diegoviola>	interesting
<diegoviola>	I really need one of those devices to monitor the watts and such
<diegoviola>	to monitor power consumption
<xeon-enouf>	for serious energy savings for laptops, look into config_x86_intel_pstate (for intel) and powerclamp
<xeon-enouf>	i don't know if powertop util is still working/relevant
<diegoviola>	xeon-enouf: thanks, I'm not very concerned about saving power on a laptop, I just want to know how much energy my desktop and other devices are using
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: PSUs in systems draw current, on an as-needed basis
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola:  a lot ;-) ... so fix your ACPI issues ;0
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: for desktops/towers/servers not so much, but also look into DynamicTicks... CPU C-States, sleep states
<xeon-enouf>	CONFIG_NOHZ for one (old)
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: HDDs and Optical Drives (+12v (for drive servos) and +5v (for controller PCBs)), and GPUs would draw most power when used
<diegoviola>	xeon-enouf: right
<diegoviola>	xeon-enouf: integrated GPUs should not use as much as a dedicated one I believe?
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: correct
<diegoviola>	I don't have one of those nvidia monsters on my PC
<diegoviola>	as I don't game
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: there's many ways to watch your current/voltage draw ... ask in ##electronics
<diegoviola>	xeon-enouf: will do, thanks :)
<xeon-enouf>	no problem ;-)  maybe even ##hardware diegoviola (if the phreaks are asleep when you ask. heh)
<diegoviola>	:D
<diegoviola>	just purchased a new ThinkPad T450, can't wait til it's on my hands... first thing I'll do is to remove Windows
<diegoviola>	and install linux
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: if you disable acpi, however, could compare /var/log/dmesg outputs (when enabled/disabled) to see what i mean about possible offlining of other CPU cores, etc
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: awesome! note an ##ibmthinkpad exists ;-)
<xeon-enouf>	see thinkwiki.org too
<diegoviola>	thanks :)
<kerframil>	diegoviola: the screen will suck. but I think I mentioned that.
<diegoviola>	I would never trust Lenovo with a default OS install, after the incident with Superfish
<diegoviola>	but does that means we should trust vendors with their proprietary BIOS/UEFI too?
<diegoviola>	kerframil: it will suck? how?
<kerframil>	diegoviola: no IPS panel
<kerframil>	diegoviola: the T450s has an option for it
<kerframil>	diegoviola: I'm sure I told you that before
<diegoviola>	kerframil: Yes, I remember now
<kerframil>	diegoviola: non-IPS Lenovo screens are among the worst I've encountered. let's hope yours isn't too bad.
<xeon-enouf>	that's definitely a "laptop" heh -- but i bet you were asking moreso about your always-on, or almost-always-on Home desktop systems (re: Power/Electricity draw - re: huge electric bill)
<diegoviola>	kerframil: sorry but how much IPS makes a difference?
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: a lot. versus a TN panel
<kerframil>	diegoviola: a lot
<kerframil>	diegoviola: that's not to say that *all* TN panels are terrible but Lenovo don't care about selecting acceptable ones. that said, I haven't used the T450.
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: still - for me, awesome graphics isn't a requirement - but a nice luxury
<diegoviola>	xeon-enouf: same here
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: the TN vs. IPS is always talked about in say ##hardware ; though expect the fanbois to abound
<kerframil>	diegoviola: what I've seen in Lenovo TN panels is very poor colour gamut with unnatural looking colors, usually with a weird blue hue. on the really bad ones, a sort of odd dot-matrix effect.
<xeon-enouf>	kerframil: that might explain why my circa ~1998 thinkpad tank looked all wonky when i booted an old knoppix cd? :-P
<xeon-enouf>	(though IBM then)
<kerframil>	xeon-enouf: I'm using an X230 atm. it's ok.
<xeon-enouf>	hrmph.. let me see here...
<kerframil>	xeon-enouf: a bit poky at 1366x768 but the screen is decent
<diegoviola>	I wish I could suspend a process, save the state to disk and then resume later
<diegoviola>	is such thing possible? without suspending the entire OS
<xeon-enouf>	www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:I1200
<xeon-enouf>	is about the closest i've found to the tank i have kerframil
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: yes, ..and no
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: be more specific
<kerframil>	diegoviola: I like it - no touchpad. makes me miss the X60.
<kerframil>	oops, xeon-enouf ^
<diegoviola>	xeon-enouf: I have a program running (photorec) that is scanning my home partition for files I've deleted, I wish I could quit the program but save the state, so that if I shutdown my machine now I can just resume it later
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: could be as simple as a Ctrl-Z
<diegoviola>	xeon-enouf: without waiting for 5 hours now til the program finishes
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: gddrescue can recover and logs what is scans...
<diegoviola>	xeon-enouf: but jobs don't survive a reboot/shutdown?
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: though not sure with photorec, which is scanning for Filetype Magic
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: yes they do -- gddrescue saves logs so you can scan sections at a time
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: you might need to tell it to, specifically
<kerframil>	diegoviola: http://criu.org
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: gddrescue is really good at skipping over bad sectors, and trying them again ..at the very end of recovery, etc
<diegoviola>	interesting, thanks
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: but.. if you just ctrl-z the process, it'll suspend; no need to shutdown
<diegoviola>	xeon-enouf: yeah I mean by shutdown I mean I literally shutting down my machine
<diegoviola>	or rebooting
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: yea, no idea with photorec; review the docs; perhaps you could have started it with proper options to do so
<diegoviola>	fg will still get the process back?
<diegoviola>	after shutdown?
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: also, yes; ,,,er no --  see man bash
<diegoviola>	ok thanks
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: fg and bg are part of JOB CONTROL
<xeon-enouf>	see man bash, that section
<diegoviola>	will do, thanks ;)
<xeon-enouf>	type "jobs" to see suspended jobs; then you can fg, or bg, or whatever
<diegoviola>	right
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: fg "%+"   #will resume (and bring into foreground) last suspended job    also; fg "%2" (for example) would resume job 2
*	ob-sed___ is now known as ob-sed
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: you can suspend with ctrl-Z, then type; bg "%N" (where N is the job number) and it'll continue in the background (as if you started the command, as "command &")
<diegoviola>	xeon-enouf: thanks
<xeon-enouf>	man bash ; type /, then type; \^Z
<xeon-enouf>	np
<diegoviola>	xeon-enouf: it looks like photorec actually has some sort of session recovery
<xeon-enouf>	coolio
<diegoviola>	when you quit and start again it ask if youi want to continue the previous session
<diegoviola>	you*
<ayecee>	i'd like to try out bcache, and have questions. can I use a file, similar to readyboost in windows? also, can i easily add a bcache device to an existing install, or does it replace my root device, essentially?
<ayecee>	so far the answers look like no and no, but i'd certainly like to hear otherwise.
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: jumping back to ACPI info; don't confuse ACPI with--> LAPIC / APIC ([Local] Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller), and yet, ACPI, if disabled could affect APIC/LAPIC functionality
*	Sarge123^off is now known as Sarge123
<diegoviola>	xeon-enouf: I see, this has been very informative, thanks :)
<xeon-enouf>	diegoviola: APIC / LAPIC is a mode for IDE/SATA disks, which can be set in BIOS usually
<xeon-enouf>	np
<diegoviola>	wish I had more time to get into electronics, it's a fascinating subject
<diegoviola>	physics also
<diegoviola>	xeon-enouf: I see
<pingfloyd>	ayecee: looks like your backing devices has to have a special bcache superblock added to it
<ayecee>	pingfloyd: is it practical to do that on an existing install?
<kerframil>	ayecee: https://github.com/g2p/blocks
<dtrott>	Got a wierd problem with XFS, how do I fix this?   http://pastie.org/10179154
<ayecee>	kerframil: nice
<kerframil>	dtrott: so what does dmesg say?
<pingfloyd>	ayecee: the implication is that you can do it in place, but I would play it safe
<ayecee>	dtrott: two filesystems with the same uuid
<ayecee>	dtrott: is the problem
<kerframil>	ayecee: I was thinking the same
<dtrott>	[ 1512.024063] XFS (loop1): Filesystem has duplicate UUID 41d47648-5e8e-48b1-a6cb-36440e17d99e - can't mount
<ayecee>	\o/
<kerframil>	dtrott: there you go
<pingfloyd>	it shows you can do it to a formatted fs, but doesn't say much more
<xeon-enouf>	ayecee: replace your root device? bcache is meant to use fasted SSDs as a level2cache of slower HDDs
<xeon-enouf>	ayecee: there's a #bcache here
<kerframil>	dtrott: I don't know why you're copying the block device and not making a fresh filesystem but look into xfs_admin if you want to change the uuid
<xeon-enouf>	ayecee: er.. on OFTC.net
<dtrott>	kerframil: the actual use case is more complex but I simplified it to a replicatable test case
<pingfloyd>	and they use the term "convert" which is also implies it.  they have blocks util to add the special superblock to the device
<xeon-enouf>	ayecee: the author is py1thon (or similarly named there)
<kerframil>	dtrott: xfs_admin -U generate. also, it should be safe to mount ro,nouuid
<xeon-enouf>	ayecee: i've watched him/her develop it over the yrs in the various kernel channels
<ayecee>	oh my. this tool needs "a shrinkable filesystem or free space immediately before the partition to convert"
<pingfloyd>	ayecee: looks like you just found a caveat there
<xeon-enouf>	dtrott: why loop1 ?
<pingfloyd>	"blocks is a tool to add a superblock at the start of a block device. There are several ways to accomplish this; blocks can convert LVM logical volumes, partitions that have some free space or a shrinkable filesystem before them, and LUKS encrypted volumes. blocks can also convert a device to LVM and then to bcache, which can be useful when a direct bcache conversion is impossible."
<xeon-enouf>	(not; instead of loop0 ... but)
<dtrott>	xeon-enouf: loop1 is not relevant its a wild goose chase the issue was the UUID's
<xeon-enouf>	dtrott: i doubt it
<pingfloyd>	is this on LVM?
<dtrott>	kerframil: Thanks changing the uuid fixed it
<ayecee>	pingfloyd: ooh, unrelated tool linked from page: https://github.com/g2p/maintboot
<ayecee>	pingfloyd: creates a in-memory boot environment and launches it with kexec, so you can e.g. repartition your root device without a livecd.
<xeon-enouf>	IOW, the loop1 device is indicative of using the same UUID (for whatever reason; but no, i didn't see the pastebin)
<pingfloyd>	that sounds pretty nice, wonder how reliable it is though
<ayecee>	me too
<xeon-enouf>	kpatch?
<ayecee>	xeon-enouf: what?
<kerframil>	xeon-enouf: no. the uuid is part of the xfs filesystem metadata and is obviously the same, because he cloned the file containing the fileystem.
<pingfloyd>	that would be extremely handy if you can count on it
<dtrott>	ayecee: Yea thats pretty cool
<xeon-enouf>	who?
<ayecee>	xeon-enouf: kexec, not kpatch
<xeon-enouf>	ayecee: do you know what kpatch is? (though i might have the name wrong) and that it uses kexec?
<ayecee>	xeon-enouf: i know what kpatch is, and it doesn't use kexec
<xeon-enouf>	kerframil: UUIDs can exist for various things, not just FSes
<MonkehParade>	Hey guys..
<xeon-enouf>	ayecee: really?
<kerframil>	xeon-enouf: they can, but it's not material to the situation
<ayecee>	xeon-enouf: really. it replaces function pointers in the running kernel, essentially.
<xeon-enouf>	ayecee: how does it accomplish its magic?
<MonkehParade>	I just wanted to ask for your advice before I screw things up.
<xeon-enouf>	kerframil: i mentioned that i didn't review the paste
<MonkehParade>	I'm running out of space on my root partition, so I plan on using gparted live to extend it with the unallocated space I freed for it.
<MonkehParade>	any pointers/tips so I don't screw up?
<ayecee>	MonkehParade: make backups
<xeon-enouf>	ayecee: the way you say it; sounds like a rootkit
<ayecee>	xeon-enouf: it kind of is
<kerframil>	xeon-enouf: I knew about this property of xfs anyway - one runs into the same thing when mounting lvm snapshots backed by xfs filesystems
<pingfloyd>	looks like kpatch takes a more granular approach to counter the need to reboot at all
<kerframil>	xeon-enouf: for that adding "nouuid" is ok because it's mounted read-only anyway
<pingfloyd>	where as kexec is more boot magic
<xeon-enouf>	kerframil: ok -- cool - thanks for the info
<pingfloyd>	two approaches to the same ends
<MonkehParade>	ayecee, I did make a clone using clonezilla
<xeon-enouf>	xfs has undergone many changes, from major changes in 3.3x or so through.. i'm reading constant changelog updates
<ayecee>	MonkehParade: alright! blow it all up. worst that can happen is that you have to restore it and try again.
<xeon-enouf>	pingfloyd: boot magic / sleep magic / kernel debugging magic
<xeon-enouf>	pingfloyd: as in /Documentation/kdump.txt
<pingfloyd>	from what I can tell kpatch is trying to avoid any downtime at all
<pingfloyd>	where kexec, the downtime window is decreased drastically
<xeon-enouf>	can it be spanned across clustered VM instances? ;-)
<ayecee>	so, since bcache is going to be a pain to set up, any suggestions on improving interactivity when doing heavy io? i'm rsyncing several gigabytes from drive to drive, and even with ionice -c 3 it still makes applications drag when they need something from the disk.
<xeon-enouf>	how does it work with/without SecureBoot  / BootGuard  ?
<pingfloyd>	that's probably your best bet aside from it being array spindles
<xeon-enouf>	ayecee: both drives are local? Busses are?
<l9>	diff -r dir dir1 does that create a snapshot?
<ayecee>	xeon-enouf: one sata, one usb. usb disk is the speed limit at ~30mb/s
<ayecee>	read from usb, write to sata.
<pingfloyd>	ayecee: bcache may not help you here though, because it mentions that it cache random access
<MonkehParade>	ayecee, thanks :3
<xeon-enouf>	ayecee: i bet, and i'm surmising here; some usb disk mount options (async)
<pingfloyd>	and ignore sequential read/write operations
<pingfloyd>	*ignores
<pingfloyd>	it would probably help you though if we're talking about a bunch of files vs. a huge file or smaller set
<ayecee>	pingfloyd: it might not help for the first load, but it should help with subsequent loads.
<xeon-enouf>	ayecee: and no, bcache wouldn't really help unless your constantly doing that (and accessing it)
<ayecee>	of the small bits of the programs that i'm running that are stalling
<xeon-enouf>	well.. might as well just load it all into RAM ;-)
<ayecee>	xeon-enouf: async won't help with the usb, since i'm reading from it :)
<xeon-enouf>	tmpfs mount
<ayecee>	xeon-enouf: there's plenty of ram here, so i'm kind of at a loss about the lagginess.
<xeon-enouf>	ayecee: well .. my point was USB 2.0 just sucks ass
<xeon-enouf>	uff
<xeon-enouf>	plenty of RAM doesn't need bcache then
<ayecee>	and yet here i am with this problem.
<pingfloyd>	actually looks like it is just a default anyway "By default it won't cache sequential IO, just the random reads and writes that SSDs excel at."
<ayecee>	pingfloyd: that's exactly what i'd like to see :)
<xeon-enouf>	bcache replaces tons of RAM with fast SSDs (ala 256GB of RAM .. but in l2cache / l2arc mode)
<pingfloyd>	and it still seems to do writeback caching as well regardless
<ayecee>	xeon-enouf: no, bcache makes a hdd behave at least a little like a ssd.
<pingfloyd>	so you still get that benefit if nothing else
<ayecee>	xeon-enouf: the bcache, at least, wouldn't get its pages evicted by large sequential io, which is what i think is happening here.
<ayecee>	though i'm not sure how to find out.
<xeon-enouf>	ayecee: duh -- that statement is not inconsistent with anything i mentioned
<xeon-enouf>	there's no "the bcache"
<ayecee>	the bcache cache*
<ayecee>	better?
<xeon-enouf>	heh
<xeon-enouf>	your problem is USB
<xeon-enouf>	period
<xeon-enouf>	IMHO
<ayecee>	i don't see how. i'm reading from the usb, and the root fs is on the sata.
<xeon-enouf>	ask GKH
<ayecee>	idk who gkh is
<pingfloyd>	I'd try creating the bcache superblock on a test system first
<xeon-enouf>	um... Greg Kroah Hartmann
<xeon-enouf>	the subsystem devel
<pingfloyd>	and then see if it lets you attach it
<pingfloyd>	that sounds like how it is supposed to work
<pingfloyd>	the docs are a bit ambiguous about things though
<ayecee>	pingfloyd: hmm, could be good project for the throwaway laptop i got :)
<pingfloyd>	I don't think it has very good documentation yet
<ayecee>	one of these days i really should figure out how to spin up a vm for this kind of thing.
<pingfloyd>	so it's probably going to be a lot of trial and error with this
<pingfloyd>	it should probably work the same in the vm, but you'd probably want hardware virtualization going on to test
<ayecee>	definitely
<ayecee>	what's the /proc/cpuinfo flag that tells you your system supports hardware virtualization?
<xeon-enouf>	svm and vmx
<xeon-enouf>	depending
<xeon-enouf>	AMD for the former; vmx = Intel, IIRC
<ayecee>	thanks. it's there! today can be the day.
<xeon-enouf>	but,, the VT-d stuff .. i forget -- there's so many new flags
<xeon-enouf>	see wikipedia.org/wiki/IOMMU
<xeon-enouf>	for that stuff
<ayecee>	what software do the cool kids use for virtual machines? the last time i tried this it was with qemu.
<pingfloyd>	kvm or vbox it seems
<ayecee>	thanks
<xeon-enouf>	Oh ...and btw; just because the flags exist, doesn't mean anything (enable it in the BIOS/uEFI)
<ayecee>	duly noted
<pingfloyd>	looks like kvm doesn't do any emulating though
<xeon-enouf>	some Sony crap craptops show CPU supports it, but they disable it in the BIOS
<xeon-enouf>	so, some have had to reverse-engineer their (various) ACPI tables
<pingfloyd>	this may be a potential caveat with this "However, the distinction between these two types is not necessarily clear. Linux's Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) and FreeBSD's bhyve are kernel modules[2] that effectively convert the host operating system to a type-1 hypervisor."
<ayecee>	i wonder if the latency is coming from the big requests, and big buffers to service them. if so, maybe there's a way to limit request sizes from processes in the idle io scheduler.
<pingfloyd>	I'm thinking you probably want a type-1 hypervisor of some sort to successfully use bcache
*	ayecee looks up hypervisor types
<pingfloyd>	I mean Type-2
<pingfloyd>	not type-1
<ayecee>	ah. yeah.
<pingfloyd>	but that's what testing is to answer
<lastmanstanding>	i had a question. how are programming contests judged worldwide? Here we manually cehck code against inp and out. Sould it not be automated?
<ayecee>	lastmanstanding: kind of depends on the criteria of the contest, i figure.
*	Fisheh is now known as MonkehParade
<lastmanstanding>	ayecee: well not a lot of people here know programming so most of our contests are taken from codechef.com practice questions
<ayecee>	lastmanstanding: there's not a lot of contests that simply require the programmer to turn a particular input into a particular output.
<dtrott>	lastmanstanding: When I participated in contests many moons ago there were automated test scripts and the winner was the one who’s code passed all the test first (in the shortest amount of programming time).
<ayecee>	dtrott: ah, nice
<dtrott>	last time I entered a contest was 1996 ...
<lastmanstanding>	dtrott: i guess i should be writing some test scripts too then.
<dtrott>	Still have the tshirt …. ;-)

<ayecee>	thanks!
<pingfloyd>	it's funny how I do a search for caveats related to vms, and I find more info about caveats related to the root fs
<pingfloyd>	I swear I sometimes find the best finds when I'm looking for something different
<ayecee>	heh

<xeon-enouf>	V1s1ble: and/or play with systemd/udev  - depending upon your poison
<V1s1ble>	I don't think it's a udev thing; also I don't run systemd .. it's GENERAL.CONNECTION when you do nmcli d show enp0s20u2c2 (the adapter name)
<V1s1ble>	I thought that might be a user friendly-editable field stored in the NM config somewhere...so I could rename them to useful names like "Ethernet" "3G Adapter" etc
<xeon-enouf>	V1s1ble: network mangler is a systemd/udev reliant service, IINM
<V1s1ble>	not on Gentoo

<deerhawk>	sauvin: lol
<pingfloyd>	to me the tough call is whether to keep avahi
<pingfloyd>	it can be handy on unfamiliar networks
<V1s1ble>	pingfloyd, oh yea, forgot about wicd.
<deerhawk>	sauvin: hi
<pingfloyd>	it's like a light weight network manager more or less
<pingfloyd>	wicd
<pingfloyd>	it can appeal to the minimalist and there's wicd-cli and wicd-curses
<V1s1ble>	Yea I see it mentioned a lot on tiling window manager threads (I use i3). NM is a little more heavy weight, but I like the interface a little better
<pingfloyd>	I have mixed feelings about windows managers
<V1s1ble>	What window manager(s) do you use?
<pingfloyd>	tiling ones don't work so well with some apps.  Sure you can get them to work, but they're more of a hassle in that environment because of the app devs' assumption of there being a stacking wm.
<pingfloyd>	certain workflows they're very ideal though
<pingfloyd>	working with a lot of terminals they're perfect for
<V1s1ble>	Yea there are a few apps like that, but in general I've never had a big problem. If you have to you can always assign a hot key to pop the window back into a float
<pingfloyd>	you could omit a wm altogether and use a multiplexer, but I prefer the windows managements of a tiling wm to a multiplexer's
<V1s1ble>	and I'm a developer, so yea...lot of terminals, editors, build windows
<V1s1ble>	You mean a multiplexer like tmux or screen?
<pingfloyd>	yep
<V1s1ble>	in X or on a console/framebuffer?
<anahumar>	assume I've a folder x containing files f1,f2,...fn and I've text file for ordering those files like 0001f1, 0002f2,....000nfn .... how can I rename the files automatically according?
<V1s1ble>	I prefer actual windows...and a non-frame buffer web browser :-P
<pingfloyd>	you mean for your window manager?
<pingfloyd>	like whether to run the wm on say directfb or X11
<V1s1ble>	anahumar, Do you have programming/scripting experience?
<V1s1ble>	pingfloyd, like do you run X11 and a terminal with your multiplexer or just a virtual console :-p
<pingfloyd>	I run X11
<V1s1ble>	anahumar, I would write a Python script; read my text file into a dictionary and then have a for loop to rename the files ... or really whatever language you prefer
<MonkehParade>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8taQPomp0Y Hey guys, watch this :3
<pingfloyd>	I usually run X11 and i3 with terminals when I need a bunch of terminals
<pingfloyd>	I might use a multiplexer if I need to keep a connection and reattach later
<V1s1ble>	pingfloyd, cool. Yea same here pretty much
<pingfloyd>	I don't like many of the shortcuts in many of multiplexers
<pingfloyd>	it feels like emac carpal tunnel inducing too much for my liking
<pingfloyd>	*emacs
<V1s1ble>	Yea...bunch of shortcuts to learn. I use xfce4-terminal currently...I fell like I should be using something better
<Froolap>	There IS nothing better.
<V1s1ble>	haha. I'm guessing you use it too Froolap? What's your window manager?
<Froolap>	xfce
<V1s1ble>	Cool
<Froolap>	it is the pinacle of linux programming,  :)
<dtrott>	I thought that was bash ;-)
<V1s1ble>	bash..with it's decade old security flaw :-P
<dtrott>	yea but noone found the flaw until about a year ago.
<anahumar>	V1s1ble: I didn't even try to learn python .. is it possible somewhat else?
<anahumar>	V1s1ble: I didn't even try to learn python .. is it possible with something else?
<anahumar>	bash?
<V1s1ble>	anahumar, What you're asking for needs to be scripted somehow. It's a programmatic problem. You could do it in bash, but that might get painful
<anahumar>	any links to do that with bash
<anahumar>	php?
<V1s1ble>	php would probably work better than bash
<anahumar>	cool
<anahumar>	any references for such a thing
<dtrott>	root
<dtrott>	sorry wrong window
<V1s1ble>	anahumar, You need to open the file with your mapping, read that into an hash (or in PHP a hash/array; same thing because PHP is kinda garbage), iterate over that ... echo out your mapping first; then change it to a rename operation (make sure you get it right; don't overwrite everything)
<V1s1ble>	anahumar, what you described sounds like an assignment I'd give to a CS 102 student; it's not very difficult. Lookup file IO, arrays and file renaming in PHP (or python or perl or whatever) and string them together

<Froolap>	why?
<mah454>	I want to compile util-linux-2.25.2 , but I can not understand : why two command mount and umount is script ?
<mah454>	I need binary command  .
<V1s1ble>	Does anyone know how to set the screen resolution of the EFI framebuffer? (see: http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/201965/setting-the-efi-framebuffers-resolution-during-boot)
<mah454>	also swapon and swapoff is script !!!!
<Froolap>	do you know what that package is for?
<mah454>	Froolap: this question is for me ?
<Froolap>	yah
<MrElendig>	mah454: because there is no need for them to be binaries?
<MrElendig>	mah454: what is the actual problem?
<MrElendig>	mount/umount are not scripts btw
<lala>	Then what are they?
<lala>	Programs?

<MrElendig>	http://git.kernel.org/cgit/utils/util-linux/util-linux.git/tree/sys-utils/swapoff.c
<MrElendig>	same
<lrocket>	Naypalm: try running autoconf
<lrocket>	if you have a configure.ac
<Naypalm>	zsh: command not found: autoconf
<MrElendig>	http://git.kernel.org/cgit/utils/util-linux/util-linux.git/log/sys-utils/swapon.c  doesn't look like it have been a script for as long as the git repo have existed..
<Naypalm>	there is a configure.ac though
<Naypalm>	guess I have to go deeper, eh?
<Naypalm>	configure autoconf
<mah454>	MrElendig: , Naypalm this is my compile parameters : http://pastebin.com/HRgEVMQC
<mah454>	please view that ...
<Naypalm>	I shall, mah454
<MrElendig>	please use a less crappy pastebin
<Froolap>	mah454: what distro are you using?
<Naypalm>	raspi?
<mah454>	Froolap: I use ubuntu 15.04 and I want to cross compile for ARM (Raspberry PI)
<Naypalm>	oh wait mah454 wasn't even talking to me
*	Naypalm idiot
<Naypalm>	anyway
<MrElendig>	well if you got util-linux from ubuntu I wouldn't be supriced for it to be messed up
<MrElendig>	:p
<mah454>	please view that pastebin
<MrElendig>	they are binaries in the ubuntu fork of util-linux too
<MrElendig>	10:58:21  MrElendig ╡ please use a less crappy pastebin
<MrElendig>	I can't open pastebin.com, and I would not even if I could
<MrElendig>	I don't like sites that has ads that uses security holes in java/flash to do nasty things
<mah454>	Okey MrElendig : view this : http://paste.debian.net/173706/
<mah454>	can open this ?
<MrElendig>	why are you doing static builds btw?
<Froolap>	mah454: is there a reason you don't want to use  Ubuntu MATE for the pi?
<MrElendig>	mah454: have you checked that they really are bash scripts and it is not just file that is messing up?
<mah454>	MrElendig: I read some document , but i recompiled without that . so make scripts
<mah454>	Froolap: I need my own linux distro for my project .
<MrElendig>	hope you are using a package manager
<Froolap>	mah454: good luck, I think you have bitten off more than you can chew....
<mah454>	For example this is sample mount command (Scripted !!!!) : http://paste.ubuntu.com/11040223/
<MrElendig>	where did you get util-linux from?
<mah454>	https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/v2.26/
<MrElendig>	mah454: uhm, the comments explains what is going on
<Froolap>	looking at what that package includes, it appears he is building a system from the ground up.
<MrElendig>	read line 6-10
<SoItBegins>	If I set a shell script's CPU with taskset, and it launches various subprograms, will the subprograms be locked to the same CPU?
<MrElendig>	SoItBegins: use cgroups
<Naypalm>	okay I'm doing `livestreamer http://hitbox.tv/badfurday &!` to fork it to bg in my shell so I can kill the shell on my desktop
<Naypalm>	is there a way that I can automate the closure of the shell
<Naypalm>	something like
<Naypalm>	livestreamer http://hitbox.tv/badfurday &! && exit
<nicolagreco>	I have a question on multilevel page tabels
<mah454>	so very very stupid package !!!! , I can not understand why compiled files stay in .libs directory ?
<nicolagreco>	tables
<mah454>	I found problem , thank you :)
<MrElendig>	mah454: https://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/tree/trunk/PKGBUILD?h=packages/util-linux
<nicolagreco>	So I have page sizes of 4kb, 32 bit address cpu and 2-level page table. I want to store 1081 pages, so I need 1024 2-nd level page-table and a 57 2-nd level page table and finally the top level page table holding 2 entries. Now, do I need to store in memory the full size of these page table or just what they occupy?

<cyber37>	Hi guys, i have a question, it's around 3 topics #wireshark #linux #c
<cyber37>	Hi guy's, i am using a socket lik that : socket(PF_PACKET, SOCK_PACKET, htons(ETH_P_ALL)))   for send ethernet packets as i want. now i would like to know something: Did i need to calculat the ethernet CRC or this is made at a lower level (linux socket or ethernet board ?) In wireshark i never see the Ethernet CRC on the frames, is it removed by low level ? (linux down to sockets or by the ethernet board ? )

<ayecee>	before each one that you want to be nice about io
<ayecee>	the last one is the only one speaking to a real device, so it makes sense to have it there.
<Narfinger>	ok thanks
<frostschutz>	Narfinger, if /dev/foo is your bottleneck, use it there. you should probably also use something like bs=64k with dd

<Stiky>	cool talkers
<Stiky>	I napped in the afternoon
<Stiky>	cant sleep
<nicolagreco>	if I move a file on the same disk, is this done in two operations (copy and write) or is this atomic?
<frostschutz>	nicolagreco, same disk or same filesystems? filesystems can usually mv/rename files without moving any data; otherwise it's copy and write
<nicolagreco>	same partition, sorry
<Stiky>	whats a good channel for virtualization chat
<nicolagreco>	frostschutz : ^
<kurahaupo>	nicolagreco: the rename() and link() system calls are atomic
<BluesKaj>	Hiyas all
<nicolagreco>	alright kurahaupo, frostschutz, so on the same partition when the OS calls the mv it does rename and link?
<kurahaupo>	nicolagreco: just rename, usually
<nicolagreco>	perfect! thanks kurahaupo
<nicolagreco>	kurahaupo: what if I move the file across two directories
<nicolagreco>	?
<kurahaupo>	nicolagreco: not sure if you mount the same fs on multiple mount points whether you can rename across the mount points or not
<nicolagreco>	I am talking about two dirs on the same partition
<kurahaupo>	nicolagreco: rename is not restricted to a single directory
<nicolagreco>	perfect!
<kurahaupo>	nicolagreco: you should take about a filesystem, which can span multiple partitions
<kurahaupo>	talk* about
<bizarrefish>	Hi all
<metaory>	Kernel 4.0.1-1-ARCH YAY!
<nicolagreco>	does the file descriptor points to an inode right?
<phre4k>	metaory: ty, didn't notice :D
<metaory>	updated smoothly with no problem
<metaory>	http://www.linuxveda.com/2015/02/16/linus-torvalds-dont-care-terminator-robots-run-linux/
<metaory>	so Skynet is maintaining their own Linux kernel !!
<metaory>	they had kernel.4 before we had it!~
<metaory>	who is Skynet
<metaory>	Skynet, the US-based company which builds robots
<kurahaupo>	nicolagreco: roughly, yes. Unless it's something like a pipe or socket which is not connected to a storage device
<bizarrefish>	I have a q regarding net namespaces: When you unshare -n (CLONE_NETNET), the process is started in a new network namespace. However, the namespace doesn't seem to be named anywhere. Is there a way to get at it and, for instance, put virtual interfaces in it?
<bizarrefish>	*CLONE_NEWNET
<bizarrefish>	(To clarify, I'd like to do this from outside the namespace, so that I can put one end of a tunnel in there)
<nicolagreco>	I have two folders on the same partition (EXT2) If I mv folder1/file folder2 and some interruption occur (e.g. power failure) could the file system ever end up being inconsistent?
*	nicolagreco is now known as nicola
<bizarrefish>	nicola: ext2 isn't journalled so yes, could happen.
<nicola>	bizarrefish: but if the mv is an atomic operation, how can this happen?
<bizarrefish>	nicola: The metadata still needs to be written back to the disk. It's atomic as far as the operating system goes, but data doesn't move from the CPU to the hard disk all at once. It's atomic relative to programs.
<nicola>	bizarrefish: no data is moved if the partition is the same no?
<rascul>	on the same fs, it's just a matter of changing the link
<nicola>	yes right, so there is no inconsistency possible to happen no? rascul
<rascul>	i don't think so
<rascul>	if you're worried about it, use rsync
<bizarrefish>	nicola: There's a tree structure in the file system which encodes the file/folder structure. A tree is made of nodes which contain pointers to the child nodes (folder nodes point to their contained file nodes). To move a node, you must erase the pointer from its parent, and then add the pointer to the new parent
<bizarrefish>	That is two operations, and has to be two operations. You cannot write both items of data to the hard disk at precisely the same moment
<bizarrefish>	A power cut between those operations will result in an inconsistent state
<nicola>	oh right I thought kurahaupo suggested that that was an atomic operation
<SoItBegins>	(Most computer science undergraduates get the tree structures assignment these days whether they want it or not. It doesn't always take.)
<nicola>	I am an undergrad revising for exams!
<bizarrefish>	nicola: It's atomic in that that intermediate state is impossible to see from the point of view of the programs running on the computer. the kernel covers it up. Doesn't let anything see that state/.
<rascul>	actually i think rename() might be atomic
<bizarrefish>	1mo, driving lesson
<rascul>	yeah, rename() appears to be have a requirement of being atomic according to sus
<rascul>	so a mv on the same fs should be atomic
<ayecee>	it's atomic from the perspective of the operating system, not of the on-disk structures.
<rascul>	you're atomic
<nicola>	bizarrefish: and should it be the opposite so first adding the pointer to the new dir and then erasing from the old dir? instead of the opposite?
<ayecee>	it's true
<nicola>	rascul ayecee any source I can read from?
<ayecee>	nicola: about what?
<nicola>	about this being atomic or not
<nicola>	I got three different answer on how mv is implemented
<rascul>	source code for rename() might be a start
<ayecee>	nicola: they're all probably right.
<bullgard4>	[Debian-8 Xfce setup] '~$ aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav' works all right. Jessie brought to me Icewasel 31.6.0.  After invocation it requests: "Experience what makes  Fiirefox the most flexible browser in the world." After clicking on it an animation appears without sound. How can I determine, if my Debian-8 audio settings are all right, because the animation is played...
<bullgard4>	...without sound?
<ayecee>	nicola: the system call itself is atomic, but the underlying operation is not.
<nicola>	1) it is atomic so inconsistencies cannot happen 2) first you copy the dir entry in the new dir and then erase entry on previous dir, so you may have the inconsistency of having a file referenced twice, but the ref count is 1 and now bizarrefish 's 3) it first erases the pointer and then copy the pointer so the inconsistency is that the file has reference 0
<nicola>	I am sure there must be one solution to this
<ayecee>	neither one is going to be great.
<ayecee>	oh. it's atomic, so inconsistencies cannot happen outside of power failure or hardware failure.
<ayecee>	#2 and #3, don't know between those. #2 sounds more right.
<nicola>	is there a place I can confirm this?
<ayecee>	yes, the source
<nicola>	like a source code or a place for people to ask?
<ayecee>	the source code, yes
<ayecee>	everything else is just opinions
<lucysan>	what is the difference between jdk7u and jdk7?
<louisdk>	I'm playing around with both Xfce 4.12 and GNOME 3.16. They both have pros and cons. Gnome apps hare pretty minimalized and only show the most needed features to you while the rest are in the menu and Xfce have classic toolbars. All you'll need in front of you. Can't decide.
<nicola>	Alright ayecee I am reading here http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/coreutils.git/tree/src/mv.c
<ayecee>	nicola: not going to learn anything from that.
<ayecee>	except that you should be looking in the kernel.
<nicola>	..., link?
<deniska>	louisdk: and yet gnome's nautilus takes care of smb shares in much nicer way if it is important to you
<nicola>	ayecee: ^
<ayecee>	nicola: why would i have a link?
<nicola>	i don't understand what you mean by that
<ayecee>	by what?
<nicola>	"except that you should be looking in the kernel"
<nicola>	ayecee: from the mv.c it is a copy and delete
<ayecee>	you're asking about the implementation of a system call.
<ayecee>	nicola: not within the same filesystem it isn't.
<ayecee>	a move from one filesystem to another isn't atomic.
<nicola>	ok
<lautriv>	got anyone this thingie -> "Bus 002 Device 003: ID 0755:2626 Aureal Semiconductor" (infrared HID by remote) mapped ?
<ekh>	why can't I cd a "www -> public_html" when both are owned by me, and the permission are 777 and 755? I get Permission denied
<ekh>	although i can cd the public_html directly
<gitup>	because its leaving the network?
<gitup>	just a guess
<ayecee>	ekh: not sure what you mean by "www -> public_html"
<ekh>	ayecee: when I ls -la, i see that www is a link tp public_html
<gitup>	oh
<ayecee>	ekh: i'm pretty much guessing at what you're seeing at this point.
<ayecee>	and probably not very well.
<gitup>	some one will answer u soon. im certain
<gitup>	why are you attempting this btw?
<ayecee>	ekh: if you're talking about a symlink, you don't have permission to one of the directories on the path to the target
<ekh>	why wouldn't you cd a www rather than a public_html :/ shorter and faster
<ayecee>	why wouldn't you just name it w, if shorter and faster were the primary concern
<ekh>	ayecee: cpanel uses www by default i think
<ekh>	anyway how do I check the permission of the directories on the path?
<gitup>	is it true you dont have permissions in all the folders?
<ayecee>	ekh: try to cd to each one in turn. that's the easiest way.
<ayecee>	easiest for me to think of, anyways :)
<ekh>	www and public_html on the same path. both inside /home/myuser/

<flan3002>	gitup - Something you should've asked, in ##linux? O.o
<emma>	If you cp a bunch of movies from /Dir1 into /Dir2 does that decrease the amount of free disk space on the machine?
<flan3002>	Yes.
<emma>	or does the machine somehow only have one copy of the movies for real?
<gitup>	yes
<flan3002>	If you mv or cp -s them, it should not decrease.
<flan3002>	*cp -l
<flan3002>	Actually, cp -l and cp -s should work.
<emma>	 cool
<emma>	I can just rm the originals
<flan3002>	Only with cp -l, AFAICS.
<emma>	I should have really mv them to begin with but I wanted more flexibility in case I did something wrong.
<emma>	i already straight up cp -a them.
<flan3002>	cp -l creates hard links, while cp -s softlinks (symbolic) them, so that's something to keep in mind when deleting the originals.
<arpz>	I ran the following command to try to create an image from a possibly damaged NTFS partition to a new drive - sudo dd if=/dev/sdb3 bs=4M | pv -B 4096 -b -r -s 247G | sudo dd of=/home/ubuntu/mnt4/damn.img bs=4M conv=noerror,sync ... It seems to be misreporting the speed, I tried this before with the default blocksize for dd and the speed was correct (stopped after a minute or so) but now it's gone beyond what I calculated it should take 
<emma>	i think i understand the concept of a symbolic link but not a hardlink.
<ayecee>	a symlink is a name that points to a name. a hard link is two names that point to the same inode.
<emma>	Just yesterday I took a Meyers-Briggs personality test and I was INTP and now every time I see someone say NTFS I'm wondering what kind of personality is that.
<rascul>	man symlink and man hardlink
<arpz>	emma: masochistic
<emma>	my friend calls it "new technology for sex"
<arpz>	emma: i don't get it
<emma>	arpz: I don't really understand him either. He's Indonesian and kind of a perv.
<arpz>	it was a joke :/
<frostschutz>	arpz, you need the noerror on the if= side
<frostschutz>	arpz, and a smaller blocksize
<ayecee>	or just use ddrescue
<ayecee>	it'll be far faster than using dd with a small blocksize.
<arpz>	I'll investigate, its present on this live cd
<arpz>	thanks
<frostschutz>	with ddrescue you should add --min-read-rate= or it will never finish for some disks
<ayecee>	eh, i'd add that if it stalled.
<frostschutz>	it's not supposed to stall in the first place
<frostschutz>	but some disks do weird error handling
<theos>	hi
<theos>	is there a software to make a call from your computer with your phone using usb/bluetooth? so you can hear the call in the computer's speakers/headphones and speak in the computer's mic?
<frostschutz>	arpz, but in your example, the dd conv=noerror,sync would crank each incomplete read from the pipe up to 4M so the result is corrupt entirely (zeroes filled in even without disk errors present); you just don't get 4M blocks from a pipe
<arpz>	frostschutz: ayecee: thank you
<ayecee>	theos: like skype?
<arpz>	i stopped it and it had already written more than 100gb further
<theos>	ayecee like control the phone with computer
<arpz>	this makes a lot more sense now, thanks for your help
<ayecee>	theos: so it would use your modem, or what?
<theos>	ayecee no. it will use the mobile phone/smartphone to make the call. the computer just acts like a headset
<ayecee>	ah

<strigga>	saymoo: Actually, I have seen a usecase running on a Raspberry PI :D But not with midi control *arrgh*
<saymoo>	huh?
<saymoo>	how's that possible
<saymoo>	(cubase is a hog)
<strigga>	saymoo: Not with cubase.
<saymoo>	ahahaha i've misread you
<saymoo>	:P
<saymoo>	usecase, was read by me as cubase
<strigga>	saymoo: With OLA - and miDi over LAN having the sequencer on a different machine.
<saymoo>	:P
<strigga>	So again: "Ey - any Rosegarden-Folks here except for }?"
<BluesKaj>	cubebase is for pro audio engineers, overly complicated and difficult to learn
<}>	(´･ω･`)
<saymoo>	not overly complicated.. if you know how it works ;P
<}>	nothing is complicated if you already know how it works
<BluesKaj>	saymoo, and not mention expensive
<}>	it's the getting to know how it works part
<strigga>	BluesKaj: I use it for aa couple of years now. If you understood it, t's fairly easy. What I actually hate is Midi :D
<theos>	so does anybody know of a handsfree software?
<saymoo>	BluesKaj, that's a valid point.. it's quite expensive at first... but then again.. it has ehm.... lots to offer
<BluesKaj>	uhm, like I said you have to learn it , that's the complicated and omplex part
<strigga>	BluesKaj: A couple of weeks ago, irt was given away for 7 EUR along with the Keys-Magazine. Only the max-16-track version but that's more than enough for home use
<BluesKaj>	strigga, no kidding
<strigga>	sushemsu: no kidding. It was sold out in minutes :D
<strigga>	BluesKaj: argh see above :D
<saymoo>	cubase for 7 dollar?
<saymoo>	err euro
<saymoo>	?
<strigga>	eur. which is 10 dollars - around
<}>	7 euro is about 7 dollars
<BluesKaj>	strigga, maybe it was simplified for the likes of me :)
<saymoo>	must be the elements version or AI (limited in many ways, compared to the big brother)... and is also given for free with hardware most times...
<strigga>	saymoo: I hardly ever reach the limits of elements. I am doing 16-Track live recording when rehersing with about 8 effects tracks
<strigga>	saymoo: enough for me
<saymoo>	depends on the use case ;)
<strigga>	saymoo: Of course
<strigga>	EH - ANY ROSEGARDEN-FOLKS AROUND? :D
<saymoo>	i mostly use midi/vst things, and then you hit the limitation quite quickly
<strigga>	Except for }?
<saymoo>	:)
<}>	:(
<emma>	How do you make electronic music, like Trance music, on Linux?
<strigga>	saymoo: what's the limits there? Max VST-Instruments?
<saymoo>	strigga, that, and less plugins supplied and more little annoyances
<LMNOP__>	thats a contradiction in terms
<strigga>	LMNOP__: Trance and Linux? :D
<emma>	I like Trance music a lot.
<LMNOP__>	well that too
<emma>	Why would Trance and Linux be a contradiction?
<theos>	botten emma, you can use audacity
<saymoo>	emma, if you like FLstudio kind of software, perhaps lmms is an option for you?
<emma>	But I think Audacity is more for like, recording, and editing but probably not creating the music.
<strigga>	saymoo: that was cubase LE7
<strigga>	And I have to admit - it was 20 EUR
<theos>	emma audacity is perfect for creating music
<emma>	theos: where do the sounds come from?
<saymoo>	strigga, aah yes, old version and the limited one indeed.. (still good enough for many things... i only had to upgrade to the full monty because of features i wanted/needed)
<LMNOP__>	computer music is a abomination
<theos>	emma look under the generate menu
<}>	LMNOP__, finally someone said it
<emma>	LMNOP__: you are very familiar with Trance?
<saymoo>	LMNOP__ i disagree
<saymoo>	:P
<strigga>	LMNOP__: Well really everything you hear nowadays is modified using computers - even live they use more and more autotune and stuff.
<saymoo>	exactly what strigga said :)
<LMNOP__>	well you made my point then
<triceratux>	emma: you run lmms as a source, you use audacity as an editor, & you ultimately give up & boot windows to run steinberg vst
<emma>	}: LMNOP__ this is vocal Trance, how could you say this is an abomination https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQbg4ijqhHY
<emma>	I dare you to listen that and then honestly tell me that is an abomination
<saymoo>	LMNOP__ explain why it is a abomination in your view
<emma>	Maybe you just like rap. Morons.
<saymoo>	i guess you mean some musical style.. more than anything else
<strigga>	LMNOP__: emma: *leaning back - grabbing popcorn and beer*
<strigga>	triceratux: right :)
<triceratux>	standalone programs such as simsynth run excellently under wine as well :)
<}>	emma, I don't need to listen to that, I lived in the 2 countries in the world where trance was most popular, and it all sucks, it's all the same too
<theos>	emma no need for "profanity". there are drum/synth software too
<LMNOP__>	lemme guess repetative beat, repetative riff, same key, boring as shit
<LMNOP__>	not listening
<emma>	}: Did you live in the Netherlands?
<}>	yes
<}>	for 8 years
<saymoo>	i don't like trance/dance/house/dubstep or so.....
<theos>	LMNOP__ try dubstep :P
<saymoo>	still using computers to make music
<saymoo>	:)
<rascul>	dupstep is stupid
<emma>	I strongly disagree with the assessment being given to Trance. It is one of the most beautiful genres.
<strigga>	saymoo: I use my computer to synch clicktrack and light - and to record the jams :) Fair use of computers and linux i guess :P
<saymoo>	hehe
<rascul>	there's very little under the umbrella of electronic dance music that i find worthwhile
<saymoo>	:)
<Romance>	saymoo: no, you can still make your own music with even nature, or cat meow. software is to remix/tune/change pitching/and all
<emma>	"I have strong opinions etched in stone. I won't listen".
<emma>	good.
<emma>	The less people listen to good music the longer it will stay good music :)
<rascul>	it'll stay good for exactly as look as you consider it good
<rascul>	*long
<strigga>	Allright - all the musicians (or wannabe musicians) are awake now. My question again: Anybody has experience with midi-controlling rosegarden?
<saymoo>	Romance, i know you can.. but i use computers (in different forms) to help me with arranging/composing/producing/mixing/mastering etc the music
<emma>	saymoo: putting dubstep in the same category as trance is also an abomination. :)
<strigga>	saymoo: mastering.. JEHOOVA!
<saymoo>	it saves me a big mixing console, lots of outbound gear and such
<rascul>	strigga i did midi stuff but it was long enough ago for me not to remember
<theos>	(what has happened to ##linux)
<userings>	I have a directory with music inside it. How i can count the total time of the songs?
<strigga>	lol
<saymoo>	theos, (it's transformed to an audio/music/toolset discussion out of sudden :P )
<saymoo>	userings, one by one?
<saymoo>	:P
<userings>	Is there a way to count it for all files in the folder, not just one by one? :D
<theos>	saymoo it has a more relaxed environment now as compared to a few years ago
<saymoo>	theos, indeed
<emma>	userings: if you can do it for one, then you could use bash to do it for all with some kind of for loop (don't know how but i bet that's true)
<}>	userings, use mediainfo
<emma>	I would like to be clear - Do most of you chatting right now dislike Trance?
<}>	userings, you can make it output a string like "123 +" for each file (123 seconds) then pipe that to bc to get the sum
<saymoo>	raises hand
<saymoo>	@ emma
<saymoo>	:)
<emma>	saymoo: are you a bad person?
*	} dislikes trance
<theos>	userings maybe calculate time by using bitrate and size. get total size of all files and multiply it
<saymoo>	lowers hand quickly
<saymoo>	:P
<nszceta>	anybody know of a way to read contents of 7z files without extracting them?
<emma>	: )
<nszceta>	more specifically, how can you browse stackexchange offline
<}>	nszceta, if you're reading it, you're extracting it
<saymoo>	in ram
<theos>	nszceta open it in archive manager
<nszceta>	ok what is a practical way to read it into RAM without extracting it onto disk
<}>	nszceta, extract it in /tmp
<}>	which will be in your RAM
<theos>	:D
<nszceta>	ok how about in OS X 10.10
<DestX>	Anyone know of any mysql-free Forum software?

<nszceta>	cool, will take a look at that
<super_mrwu>	....

<nszceta>	I have bash 4.3.33
<nszceta>	compiled from source
<}>	or just pipe it directly if at all possible
<nszceta>	is there a way to expose the files inside the 7z as a volume?
<saymoo>	doesn't ehm... osX have a archive manager, so you can look inside the archive without extracting it to disk?
<nszceta>	hmm
<saymoo>	(migh be easier than commands)
<super_mrwu>	consider p7zip?
<}>	saymoo, what makes you think the osx archive manager doesnt extract to disk?
<}>	it could extract it to /tmp without you knowing
<}>	or something
<saymoo>	could be...
<saymoo>	:)
<nszceta>	I dont have an "archive manager"
<nszceta>	I use Keka which is basically a thin wrapper for 7zip
<saymoo>	}, hence the question mark :P
<nszceta>	not sure what the equivalent of mtab is
<super_mrwu>	nszceta: you want to read the file content without extracting the archive?
<}>	he wants to extract it in RAM
<super_mrwu>	onto the disk
<}>	on osx
<nszceta>	i can't really extract the archive to RAM because I dont have 20GB of RAM
<super_mrwu>	ok
<}>	...
<nszceta>	but maybe I can extract most of what I need
<super_mrwu>	you may need a front-end
<super_mrwu>	haha
<saymoo>	lawl
<ExeciN>	you can maybe do it on a ramdisk
<nszceta>	???
<nszceta>	nevermind, looks like the largest 7zip in the SO dump is 11GB
<nszceta>	I can deal with that
<}>	nszceta, does osx support tmpfs?
<nszceta>	chkin
<nszceta>	ramdisk would be sweet
<}>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Tmpfs , by default tmpfs uses 50% of your RAM, but you can set it to 100%
<theos>	nszceta convert 7zip to iso and mount it?
*	super_mrwu is wondering if p7zip can act as a front-end so that nszceta's inquiry can be solved.
<nszceta>	I hate how simple things like a ramdisk generator are now sold as an "APP"
<nszceta>	then there are dozens of blogs spreading misinformation and lies
<nszceta>	anywya
<nszceta>	back to the tech
<nszceta>	theos wat?
<theos>	nszceta you can mount iso without extracting them i think. like volumes
<nszceta>	7z is compressed
<nszceta>	ISO is not compressed
<}>	nszceta, use fuse-zip
<saymoo>	but it can contain compressed data :P (sorry couldn't help myself)

<theos>	unless it wasnt compressed
<saymoo>	hahaha
<}>	beep boop
<super_mrwu>	nszceta: 7z e -so abc.7z META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
<super_mrwu>	maybe that helps
<nszceta>	META-INF/MANIFEST.MF??????
<}>	is 7z really better than xz?
<super_mrwu>	}: no
<nszceta>	its the same thing
<super_mrwu>	}: merely the same
<nszceta>	slightly different bit fields
<}>	then why are there 2 tools, xz and 7z
<super_mrwu>	}: but have different archive structure
<nszceta>	or rather, xz doesn't have structure
<nszceta>	that's tar's job
<}>	"xz doesn't have structure", it appears xz is my spirit animal
<rascul>	xz is kinda like a subset of 7zip
<super_mrwu>	}: 7z can handle directories
<nszceta>	yeh
<}>	so 7z is tar+xz combined?
<saymoo>	hence tar.xz
<rascul>	7z can also use other compression algorithms
<super_mrwu>	nszceta: META-INF/MANIFEST.MF is just a file inside the archive.
<nszceta>	xz iso ok
<nszceta>	* oh ok
<nszceta>	7z is its own thing
<nszceta>	tar.xz is a combination of two tools
<nszceta>	we have 3 things going on
<rascul>	7z is more comparable to tar than to xz
<super_mrwu>	7zip has similar functionality as tar.xz
<saymoo>	the z part is comparable with xz

<saymoo>	BluesKaj, i've played in bands for years.. so using beat loops etc... i a no go for me... human played drums sound, well ehm human aka alive...
<BluesKaj>	saymoo, I'm a drummer so I'm biased against beat buddies and the like
<saymoo>	well, i'm a keyboardist, but i prefer self played vs programmed loops (e.g. drum patterns, chord lines, etc)
<saymoo>	only emma likes programmed loops better...
<saymoo>	:P
<saymoo>	(dance/trance/whupwhupstep)
*	} glares at emma
<saymoo>	BluesKaj, so we have the same vision (live vs loops)
<emma>	repetition to me is not necessarily a bad thing in music. But even allowing for that, trance is not entirely repetitious. There are variations on a theme and its quite complex.
<emma>	I think probably most of you who say you don't like Trance aren't really sure what it is.
<BluesKaj>	yup, we don't have any lewps ...they're for one man bands like my frirnd Dan Walsh
<saymoo>	repetition is a common use in music... but it's more about how the repetition is being produced.. 1) via playing it live, 2) looping
<BluesKaj>	Trance ...needs drugs
<BluesKaj>	thud thud
<pclover>	if it needs drugs it sucks
<}>	emma, I know that armin, tiesto and paul van dyk make the same music every year of their career
<emma>	first of all, what doesn't benefit from drugs?
<emma>	Secondly, I listen to Trance without drugs and in my home all the time. It's just beautiful music.
<saymoo>	emma, to my ears, dance, trance is all the same... (it's the same 4/4th drum pattern for most times, and same kind of sounds/loops being used)... but then again, i don't like rock'n'rock either
<emma>	Thirdly - Art is art. If you listen to a recording of your non-electronic music, it is also a recording.  But if you go to a 'live show' that is just a different experience. With Trance, a live show is also about the atmosphere and the visual stimulation and great audio set up.
<emma>	Dance and Trance are totally different to people who know the genres.
<BluesKaj>	ok emma you're entitled to your opinion , but then we have to agree to disagree
<pclover>	to bad most of the new Trance music is garbage now
<theos>	all the art is propaganda
<BluesKaj>	emma, genres that i don'tr care about I'm afraid
<saymoo>	emma, that's correct.. but the overall genre (modern house, which is the mother of the subgenres, like trance/hardcore etc) i don't like...
<BluesKaj>	it;s still thud thud to me
<saymoo>	and if you don't like the mother, it's hard to like a child from it.. (musically speaking)
<emma>	I am super suspicious that most of you don't know what Trance is.
<emma>	some of you think trance is just 'electronic music'
<}>	nah, I like gabber and some dnb
<BluesKaj>	well i don't care what it is
<emma>	lol you like gabber
<}>	its just trance/dance/hardstyle that is terrible
<saymoo>	emma, well, it is in the core... it can be extended with other instruments.. but the essence is Electronic
<pclover>	}, you cannot compare them...
<emma>	saymoo: yeah but different electronic genres are so different they are not really meaningfully compared by just saying 'electronic'
<LeAlex>	how do i install an xz file in hyperv?
<emma>	dubstep is so different from trance
<Psi-Jack>	LeAlex: hyperv?
<}>	pclover, compare what
<pclover>	dubstep is also awful
<emma>	gabber is 'electronic' but isn't even music. It's just noise.
<saymoo>	emma, that's true...

<LeAlex>	Psi-Jack, yeah. I want to install funtoo. i'm running windows 8.1 atm

<pclover>	older stuff no
<}>	doesn't linux have support for hyper-v?
<saymoo>	emma, let me say, overall (there are a few exceptions), i don't like the dance (whichever subgenre, since they share the same basic) patterns being used
<Psi-Jack>	}: Because Microsoft put their dirty hands into Linux's source code, yes.

<saymoo>	lol
<Psi-Jack>	I was about to say, this talk of music stuff... Needs to stop.

<Psi-Jack>	heh
<Psi-Jack>	Oh.
<saymoo>	Psi-Jack, sir yes sir
<saymoo>	:)
<emma>	saymoo: obviously trance, like every other genres, has certain conventions which is what makes it identifiable as a genre. You could say absolutely the same thing about any kind of music. It's called a four on the floor beat.
<Psi-Jack>	LeAlex: funtoo's website has documentation to which you will need to read thoroughly.

<supay>	hey guys.. i keep getting this error - sh: parse_git_branch: command not found.. and i see a function in my .bash_prompt but i dont think theres a problem with it
<theos>	depends on the company that produced it
<supay>	any way i can fix this issue?
<}>	supay, add a parse_git_branch function so sh sees it
<}>	I don't think sh reads .bash_prompt, so it won't see it
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<Psi-Jack>	sh does not read .bashrc or .bash_profile, no.
<supay>	}: firstly, nice nick.. secondly, .bash_prompt contains such a function..
<Psi-Jack>	There is no .bash_prompt. :p
<}>	supay, right, but you said sh issues the error, not bash
<}>	so you need to source .bash_prompt in sh
<supay>	hm
<supay>	.bash_profile contains this:
<supay>	https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/JTigFt3j
<ohcanada>	i'm just wondering if .bash_prompt is perhaps .bash_profile

<}>	no
<}>	ohcanada, you do realize you can name a file anything you want and source it?
<}>	he could name it .bash_shiggydiggy
<supay>	}: which files are usually read by sh? where should i put the parse_git_branch{} function?
<ohcanada>	actually the new Dunham Extensions for dash, propose just that
<supay>	lol
<}>	supay, generally you just don't use sh interactively
<Psi-Jack>	supay: Better question, why would you want to use sh which wouldn't support your functions anyway?
<supay>	hm, i dont really think im on sh.. im on bash, on a mac
<Psi-Jack>	Uh huh... We don't support Mac here.
<Psi-Jack>	Good luck.
*	Psi-Jack knew there was something fishy about this. :)
<}>	supay, show your .bashrc
<welpo>	I have this alias foo='find "${HOME}"/test/ -type f -name *.sh -exec ls -H {} \;' which lists .sh files in the ~/test/ folder. I was wondering if it's possible to list only the file name instead of the full path: file.sh instead of /media/disc/home/user/test/file.sh
<Psi-Jack>	}: Mac, not Linux.
<andrew39>	supay, why not put parse_git_branch in a parse_git_branch.sh in your ~/bin/ directory among your other scripts you want to call
<supay>	}: one moment
<supay>	}:  it contains 1 line --> export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin" # Add RVM to PATH for scripting
<}>	supay, your problem is that you used .bash_profile, but you should be using .bashrc, .bash_profile is used by login shells
<}>	supay, .bashrc is used by non-login interactive shells
<ohcanada>	welpo: man basename
<supay>	ah, i see
<}>	supay, that is put this for file in ~/.{path,bash_prompt,exports,aliases,functions,extra}; do .... etc into .bashrc
<}>	and it will then source .bash_prompt whenever .bashrc is read
<welpo>	ohcanada: Perfect, just what I wanted. Thanks!
<supay>	so copying the contents of bash_profile into .bashrc should fix?
<supay>	ah, alright! :)
<}>	Psi-Jack, dont think its a mac issue, he just used the wrong file
<ohcanada>	welpo: prolly something like, -exec basename {} \;
<supay>	andrew39: thats also a good idea.. but copying the bash code to .bashrc seems like an easy fix
<welpo>	Yeah I did that and it works
<Psi-Jack>	Well, still, asking for Mac OS X help in a Linux channel is still off-topic. :p
<andrew39>	ya send him to #windows ;-)
<supay>	Psi-Jack: very sorry.. but unfortunately, there dont seem to be any macos help chans on freenode. i apologise

<lapide_viridi>	I'm wondering, how much effort would one need to make Microsoft Office and Photoshop work on Linux? I've understood that the reasons lie elsewhere, like Microsoft wanting people to use Windows, but how hard is it actually to make a program work on multiple systems?
<zorak8>	whats the @ do there }?
<supay>	}: any idea what the problem could be? :(
<ohcanada>	lapide_viridi: well without virtualisation it is almost impossible to change closed-source programs to run on other OS
<}>	supay, expands the array
<}>	oops
<}>	zorak8, ^
<}>	supay, sure, you did something wrong. Is your .bashrc sourced when you run a new shell?
<ohcanada>	lapide_viridi: i'm assuming you mean without the co-operation of MS
<supay>	}: hm.. i dont know :/
<bizarrefish>	lapide_viridi: wine, a Linux implementation of the Windows APIs, runs office, iirc
<}>	supay, put echo WOOOHOO IT WORKS at the end of your .bashrc
<hay207>	hi guys, what is the programming language used in this game http://freetennis.sourceforge.net/ ?
<lapide_viridi>	ohcanada, virtualisation is what I see as the best way of making a program work on another system. Compatibility layers seem a bit clumsy to me.
<}>	then open a new shell
<lapide_viridi>	bizarrefish, yeah, I've tried that too.
<supay>	}: btw, should the .bashrc be in the root directory? or in my users directory? as in ~/.bashrc ?
<supay>	}: smart test.. one moment
<lapide_viridi>	But actually, right now I just wonder how hard it would be for the developers to make the programs for other systems.
<}>	supay, if youre running as root it should be in the root dir, otherwise no
<ohcanada>	lapide_viridi: indeed. wine will always be a few steps behind, and be prone to undocumented "effects"
<}>	hay207, http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetennis/files/freetennis/0.4.8/
<}>	hay207, download that and see for yourself
<bizarrefish>	lapide_viridi: Thing is, the interface provided by windows to its programs, is FAAAAR more complex than that interface provided by a PC to windows. A PC has processors, a bus, memory, etc.. These things are easily modelled correctly. Software APIs are a lot more complex - they include a lot more stuff.
<hay207>	well i am new to programming
<hay207>	so can't decide
<}>	hay207, decide what?
<ohcanada>	lapide_viridi: not hard at all. but they would need to choose a gui toolkit. like qt, gtk, wx or whatever
<supay>	}: interesting.. the line should echo whenever i open terminal now.. but it doesnt
<hay207>	cmx cmi ml o
<}>	supay, don't open a new terminal, just type bash
<hay207>	it has these file types
<supay>	}: nothing. just the same error about parse_git_branch
<}>	hay207, paste one of the source files so we can look at it
<}>	supay, that means .bashrc is not read
<bizarrefish>	lapide_viridi: As far as difficulty in porting the program goes, depends on how many things provided by one system they depend on. Generally, it's a lot of work, given the complexity of such interfaces.
<}>	at all
<ohcanada>	lapide_viridi: they are never ever ever going to port office or photoshop to linux. so in a way, all this is fun speculation for a spring saturday, with the chaffinches singing in the sun
<lapide_viridi>	bizarrefish, basically, what you are saying is that the programs make use of an interface given by the operating system, which differs from system to system?
<supay>	}: i see.. but is it trying to read another file maybe?
<bizarrefish>	lapide_viridi: Correct.
<pid1>	lapide_viridi, That's correct.
<bizarrefish>	lapide_viridi: And that interface is usually huge
<lapide_viridi>	ohcanada, that is exactly what I had in mind when I asked myself that question.
<hay207>	only ml opens, here http://pastebin.com/MiRynHMD
<}>	supay, type
<}>	bash -x
<lapide_viridi>	So in order for, say MS to make Office for both Windows and OSX, they would need to make large parts of the programs from scratch?
<bizarrefish>	lapide_viridi: Yup.
<supay>	}: wow shit, thats a LOT of text
<supay>	do i copy/paste here?
<ohcanada>	} At the synergistic heart of dunham dash, is a holistic quintessence that redefines the interactive boundaries of the object-oriented user experience, while leveraging an admixture of legacy and bespoke paradigms, to enhance the inclusivity and response of the user-oriented workflow

<hay207>	ok thanks
<}>	supay, paste it somewhere
<supay>	okay
<Psi-Jack>	supay: Again, this is not a Mac OS X support channel, if you need bash support specifically, that channel is #bash
<Psi-Jack>	So, you two can take it there.
*	} has never used an apple product
<pid1>	hay207, That game is written in ocaml
<supay>	okay, sorry
<bizarrefish>	lapide_viridi: Linux doesn't just have different words for things to windows, it just talks differently, with different concepts. They would first need to cut Office in half into common and OS-specific parts. They'd build a different OS-specific part depending on what OS they were running on. Problem is, the interface between the common and OS-specific part in itself would be a nightmare
<supay>	}: thanks for the direction and help :)
<ohcanada>	i bought my wife an apple appliance the other day
<ohcanada>	an iRon
<GPenguin>	haha
<}>	lol
<}>	pid1, I was close enough :-(
<zorak8>	i dont know why this is not working
<super_mrwu>	iRon?
<super_mrwu>	lol
<bizarrefish>	Every time they wanted to rearchitect something, it'd likely require modifications to the common part's interface, and the two OS-specific parts would need to be updated to remain compatible.

<xeon-enouf>	s/if/of/
<bizarrefish>	Abstraction layers can be horrid to maintain.
<zorak8>	if i want to loop to each file in a directory, what can i use?
<hay207>	thanks pid1
<lapide_viridi>	Bear with me a little longer please, because this may seems stupid, but I want it verified. If I make a script in Ruby, it runs on both Windows and Ubuntu because both have the same version of Ruby installed, but customized for each OS' "interface"? But all programs are made in some kind of language, which should exist for more platforms. Why won't something like MS Office or Photoshop work on that principle?
<lapide_viridi>	Those programs are also made in some kind of language, aren't they?
<zorak8>	i remember use 'for f in file', and then use $f as the variable
<}>	lapide_viridi, ruby is an interpreted language, office is a compiled binary
<Psi-Jack>	lapide_viridi: Choices.
<zorak8>	but today is not working
<bizarrefish>	lapide_viridi: The ruby runtime has different os-specific parts. You'll find a lot of windows and linux-specific functionality is inaccessible from ruby.
<pid1>	lapide_viridi, They are not written in a way that is portable between operating systems.
<rumpel>	lapide_viridi, less portability, less effort for tests/support/...
<super_mrwu>	lapide_viridi: the difficulty of maintainance.
<lapide_viridi>	Wow, so much feedback. Thank you guys! I honestly find this very interesting, even though it isn't very nice for the end user.
<super_mrwu>	rumpel: to my knowledge, Photoshop requires OPENGL somehow, so porting the 3D manipulation part to Linux won't be very difficult.
<dyllan>	Hi guys. I am looking to do some scripting in linux and would like to port it to a web front-end for ease of use. I have some experience with php and bash, any suggestions on how to go about this, or a good resource? - thanks
<bizarrefish>	lapide_viridi: A huge amount of work probably goes into writing the modules which bridge the 'ruby' world to either the 'windows' or 'linux' world. They have to implement the same model twice, using two different sets of concepts. Abstraction layers like that are a huge source of bugs.
<Psi-Jack>	dyllan: Eh?
<}>	Psi-Jack, there was a guy yesterday in #bash who said he works as a sysadmin, but has never written a script, this reminded me fo that somehow
<Psi-Jack>	Heh
<Psi-Jack>	}: Sysadmins are the low-level grunts that just do tickets and aren't as skilled. :p
<dyllan>	Psi-Jack: Well I have a bash script that performs a couple tasks based on user input. I would prefer that input via a web browser. So selections/ instructions are made via a browser which then interacts with the bash script.
<super_mrwu>	dyllan: EPOLL v.s. ASYNC on Solaris v.s. IOCP on Windows.
<dannylee>	will there be a zorin 10
<dyllan>	Finding it difficult to explain myself lol :D
<bizarrefish>	dyllan: You can either exec bash from PHP, or just use CGI to have the web server execute bash directly.
<Psi-Jack>	dyllan: ... So,... You need #php?
<lapide_viridi>	Could we conclude this discussion in that the future lies in the web? If the application is made in languages for webdev, only the browsers would have to be ported to the different systems. Also, in this case we already have enough browsers, don't we?
<super_mrwu>	lapide_viridi: yes
<}>	If the future lies in the web, I want no part of it
<dyllan>	Ok exec bash from php - thanks.
<super_mrwu>	lapide_viridi: but we should consider the efficiency of execution.
<lapide_viridi>	}, see, now you make this interesting again.
<rumpel>	there are spiders in the web
<Psi-Jack>	dyllan: Keep in mind, that'll be a security issue by developing something like that if it has any security concerns. :p
<lapide_viridi>	super_mrwu, erm, what kind of execution are we talking about?
<dyllan>	Psi-Jack: yep, spot on thanks
<}>	lapide_viridi, The web interface for any interesting project still runs compiled binaries on the server side, it's a lot of additional work just to entice end users who aren't adequate enough to install a package
<super_mrwu>	lapide_viridi: an application based on browser
<bizarrefish>	lapide_viridi: I'd say that using the web just moves the problem. As the web gets more and more sophisticated, with browsers providing more and more access to advanced features, the browser is essentially bearing the burden that the OS is supposed to, of supporting a standardized model. It just moves the problem to a different bit of code.
<xeon-enouf>	the internet of stings
<zorak8>	how can i loop in each file in a directory?
<}>	zorak8, for f in * ; do thing ; done
<bizarrefish>	lapide_viridi: The important decision is what problems do we solve first. Advantage of web model is that things like garbage collection are handled automatically, simplifying the interfaces greatly.
<lapide_viridi>	super_mrwu, alright. I was afraid that you simply wanted to kill of all the Windows users. You never know.
<super_mrwu>	lapide_viridi: yes, :-P
<ohcanada>	for f in $(find /dir -maxdepth 1 -type f) ; do stuff "$f" ; done
<}>	ohcanada, find seems overkill for this
<}>	*(.) will list only files, not dirs
<super_mrwu>	lapide_viridi: just consider how DOTA2 is ported to Linux.
<ohcanada>	} the chances of anyone here agreeing on any recipe, simple or otherwise, is exactly nil :)
<lapide_viridi>	Alright people, thanks for your answers. Honestly, I have never had so much feedback before.
<}>	ohcanada, >:(
<super_mrwu>	lapide_viridi: >:)
<lapide_viridi>	Time will show.
<}>	lapide_viridi, to give you a further elaboration, if you just want to make things cross platform, you don't need a browser to do the GUI and file i/o things, there are many frameworks like Qt and etc.
<lapide_viridi>	super_mrwu, now we just have to find the most effective execution method.

<pid1>	lapide_viridi, Not necessarily. Different distributions have different packages installed.
<DarkElement>	Night_Elf, I did all of it through the vm itself, and later removed the iso and have been running it ever since
<pid1>	Depending on package versions, something may or may not work correctly.
<super_mrwu>	lapide_viridi: if the program is statically link, that will be true.
<super_mrwu>	staticly
<}>	super_mrwu, you need 1) properl kernel (dont try running it on android for intance) 2) proper architecture, if you compiled for x86_64 it wont work x86 3) every depency (check with ldd /path/to/binary)
<}>	oops lapide_viridi ^
*	xeon-enouf ability to express himself linguistically, in an elegant and eloquent manner, is so elusive at the moment, heh
<lapide_viridi>	I see that there are two downloads of Chrome for Linux, one debian and one fedora. Is it the same issue with "interfaces" again?
<super_mrwu>	}: yes
<Night_Elf>	DarkElement: And how did you connect to the vm itself during installation?
<}>	super_mrwu, meant to tab complete lapide_viridi
<}>	lapide_viridi, no, different package managers
<}>	lapide_viridi, cant install a .deb package on fedora
<}>	hence two links
<DarkElement>	Night_Elf, what do you mean? I just accessed it like you would any other vm
<}>	I can unpack that .deb and install it on archlinux, but its a manual process
<lapide_viridi>	}, can't you just install another package manager? What is the issue here?
<Psi-Jack>	...
<}>	no
<Psi-Jack>	lapide_viridi: No.
<bizarrefish>	lapide_viridi: Yup, two different interfaces. In this case, the interface is gargantuan, not only include functions provided by the OS, but the names and location of various things which are expected to be present and work a particular way. All part of the interface.
<DarkElement>	Night_Elf, I've gtg for now. Can I pm you when I'm back?
<Night_Elf>	DarkElement: I would access any other vm either from the console provided to it by the hypervisor (vmware, xen, hyperv, etc), either by remote connecting to the vm itself. But this last option is *after* I have installed them initially, which I do through the hypervisor supplied console.
<bizarrefish>	lapide_viridi: Fedora organizes files slightly differently to Debian. The init system works differently. If a program wants to interact with those parts of the system, it needs to know about them. Hence, it needs to have knowledge of the interface.
<xeon-enouf>	lapide_viridi: all you need to know is; an ELF is an elf is an eLF
<}>	xeon-enouf gets it
<xeon-enouf>	compile away
<DarkElement>	Night_Elf, alright, that's what it means. I will work on remote connecting later then. gtg!
<DarkElement>	Do you mind if I pm you later if i have problems?
<Psi-Jack>	DarkElement: Feel free to re-join the channel. :p
<super_mrwu>	xeon-enouf: and elf is, the abbreviation of Executable and Linkable Format
<DarkElement>	alright, ty!
<lapide_viridi>	xeon-enouf, alright. Now, what is an elf, apart from the ones in Tolkien's books?
<super_mrwu>	lapide_viridi: Linux's standard executable format.
<bizarrefish>	lapide_viridi: You can have convergence of technology where functionality of two bits of software is almost if not exactly equivalent, but everything has different names. in these situations, you can build tools to automatically convert between the two. You do get tools which can convert debian packages to RPM and vice versa, but they won't rewrite a debian package to work with a fedora system
<super_mrwu>	lapide_viridi: also Solaris
<}>	Psi-Jack, do you know of a way to check how much data was written to a specific filesystem since it was mounted?

<Psi-Jack>	}: And it depends on what you mean exactly. Do you want to know the entire lifetime of how much data has been written, since it was created, to the beginning of time?
<}>	Psi-Jack, no, since it was mounted since boot
<lapide_viridi>	But distros from the same "branch", like Debian, Ubuntu, Raspbian, etc., will have software that works on all of them?
<Psi-Jack>	You would have to implement auditing.
<super_mrwu>	Raspbian?
<super_mrwu>	is it a distro?
<bizarrefish>	lapide_viridi: More often, but they still vary to some extent. If they didn't vary, there wouldn't be a point in having different ones.
<Psi-Jack>	super_mrwu: It's distributed, so yes.
<super_mrwu>	Psi-Jack: sounds cool.
<lapide_viridi>	super_mrwu, it is a distro for the Raspberry Pi, which is based on Debian, apparently. The first one I learned to use.
<}>	lapide_viridi, a package from an old version of ubuntu can work on debian since it would meet all the dependencies, a package from current ubuntu wont work on debian stable
<Psi-Jack>	super_mrwu: Sounds like rPI garbage. :p
<}>	lapide_viridi, you're thinking of it the wrong way, you just need to know how a binary works, how it's loaded and how it works with statically and dynamically linked libraries
<}>	lapide_viridi, if you know those things, you won't have any questions at all
<pid1>	lapide_viridi, No. A .deb file is not necessarily portable between Ubuntu, Debian, and Rasbpian
<bizarrefish>	lapide_viridi: Generally, all the debian based distros use dpkg/apt for package management. Ubuntu uses a different init system to debian, though. Fine if the program doesn't want to use that bit, but if it does, it will only work on the one it's aware of.
<lapide_viridi>	}, I think I can find out of that, but I've basically understood it by now.
<Psi-Jack>	lapide_viridi: Google resulted me in this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format
<Psi-Jack>	Have fun. :p
<}>	lapide_viridi, don't trus to understand ELF in its entirety, the ELF headers are rather large, just get to know the basics
<}>	s/trus/try
<lapide_viridi>	Jupp, I'll have a look to broaden my understanding. Thanks again for the numerous explanations!
<}>	and don't try to manually write an elf binary, just look at how an assembler would do it
<}>	although there are people that can manually write binaries without assemblers (with the proper executable format)
<Xanather>	sounds like a waste of time
<}>	Xanather, it's for tiny program contests, where you create the smallest binary possible

<saptech>	i have the new partition. how do I move it to the end of disk?
<saptech>	it's unallocated space as of now
<BluesKaj>	saptech, swap?
<saptech>	not swap
*	Don is now known as Guest55855
<[R]>	saptech: you can drag them in gparted
<saptech>	it's not letting me drag it
<[R]>	right click and say resize/move
<saptech>	when I right click, only options are New & Information. everything else is grayed out
<[R]>	then unmount it
<ReScO>	Ugh.
<ReScO>	Whihc linux distro allows the use of Adobe Photoshop CC, Adobe Illustrator CC and Microsoft Office Word, Excel and Powerpoint?
<ReScO>	which*
<saptech>	it's not mounted. this is why I can't figure it out
<[R]>	ReScO: linux is linux... if you can run it on one, you can run it on any
<ReScO>	[R] that's not true :P
<ReScO>	especially not with this damn Asus laptop
<[R]>	ReScO: it most defintely is...
<[R]>	and your laptops brand has no effect on which softwaare will work on which dist
<ReScO>	the point is, i'm a developer, and i'm currently devving on a Ubuntu VPS... at least, the files are hosted there and stuff
<[R]>	DEVELOPERS DEVELOPERS DEVELOPERS
<[R]>	ReScO: congradulations
<}>	a developer who thinks distributions have magic properties akin to fairy dust
<ReScO>	having a Intel Haswell i7 + Nvidia GeForce GTX850M
<[R]>	ReScO: double gold star
<kurahaupo>	saptech: they're called partitions for a good reason - they're just logical boundaries. If you want to move the data between partitions you'll have to do that separately, and without having it mounted
<ReScO>	that sucks either way, Ubuntu sucks ass for any Optimus kinda support
<[R]>	ReScO: i'm sorry you feel that way
<BluesKaj>	ReScO, there are better ways to express your displeasure
<ReScO>	and the reason i want a proper linux distro is for the simple reason, i want to run php and shit locally without the mess Windows tends to make of it, and i frikken love linux, i've used Arch, RHEL, Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora and Kali/Backtrack
<saptech>	kurahaupo, since I am doing this with a running system. I need to boot a livecd and make the move?
<ReScO>	I've felt the most happy about Arch for it's versatility, but Ubuntu for it's easy installing and widespread support
<kurahaupo>	saptech: and by  "move data" of course we mean *copy* it
<pid1>	ReScO, have you looked at the evo/lution installer or Antergos?
<pid1>	Antergos, especially, gives you an Ubuntu installer and a pretty vanilla Arch install.
<kurahaupo>	saptech: why do you want to reorder the partitions?
<saptech>	kurahaupo, I want to move an empty partition that I just created. I want to move it to the end of disk so it doesn't through my other partitions numbers off
*	toothe wonders if roundcube or squirrelmail do PGP.
<toothe>	or if there are any alternatives...
<kurahaupo>	throw
<saptech>	right
<saptech>	*throw
<saptech>	I want new partition to be listed as /dev/sda9
<saptech>	not /dev/sda3 or /dev/sda4
<kurahaupo>	saptech: mount using UUIDs and then the partition numbering is irrelevant
<saptech>	kurahaupo, do I need to format the new partition? Currently it is unallocated
<BluesKaj>	sa only if your gonna use it
<BluesKaj>	saptech,^
<kurahaupo>	saptech: remove the new partition, then move the others down. But they have to be unmounted. Then make new partition again
<saptech>	ok
<saptech>	hmmm, I need a livecd
<saptech>	ok, thanks guys
<RayTracer>	saptech: if you're adventurous, read about LVM
<kurahaupo>	saptech: other than /etc/fstab, why do you care about the partition numbering? Moving partitions is dangerous, you will corrupt them if you have a power failure midway
<}>	RayTracer, what's adventurous about LVM?
<RayTracer>	}: I thought it might be adventurous for someone wishing his partition to be named /dev/sda9
<}>	Isnt there some trick to changing device names with duev?
<}>	so he could change it to /dev/sdwhatever
<}>	s/duev/udev
<RayTracer>	idk, I just use LVM and my block devices are named like /dev/raid5/home
<saptech>	kurahaupo, how do I get the UUID for the new partition?
<}>	RayTracer, you name your volume group raid5?
<}>	saptech, blkid
<RayTracer>	}: yes, and the other one is called ssd
<}>	I guess I'm not original, I just called mine vg0
<RayTracer>	I always try to give meaningful names instead of vg0/lv0 and alike
<kurahaupo>	saptech: I mean, use the UUIDs for mounting your existing partitions
<kurahaupo>	saptech: a uuid is generated during mkfs
<jxierx>	Hi. My main is windows and I want to make dual boot with ubuntu. Where do I start about partition, do I need recovery media(OEM), backup?
<jxierx>	What is the risks :(
<saptech>	I need to make the filesystem
<}>	jxierx, just dont delete your windows bootloader and nothing bad will happen
<jxierx>	What is windows bootloader :D so i can delete it? (joke)
<}>	...
<}>	jxierx, do you have 2 physical disks? or just one
<stupid-1>	i have fedora21 on my dell boxs...and it came with gnome,,can i still put kde on this computer
<RayTracer>	jxierx: i guess for at least half of the chan it would also be ok if you delete not only the boot loader ;)
<jxierx>	i have one hdd for laptop
<jeffree>	stupid-1: yes
<pid1>	stupid-1, Yes, of course.
<jxierx>	RayTracer: i will saw you
<stupid-1>	i just use yum rite
<jeffree>	stupid-1: yes
<RayTracer>	stupid-1: do a yum grouplist -v (then probably yum groupinstall kde-desktop-environment)
<stupid-1>	ill just install every thing with kde on it
<stupid-1>	c00000L
<stupid-1>	thank
<jeffree>	raymondh-: what is grouplist (never used yum)
<RayTracer>	jeffree: it lists the package groups
<stupid-1>	KDE is just aa little better than gnome..for my taste..thanks
<}>	jxierx, ok then  your best bet is to keep the windows bootloader and chainload grub from it
<RayTracer>	jeffree: fedora puts some groups together so you don't need to install *kde* or something like that; with -v you also get the short group names like kde-desktop-environment or c-development
<jxierx>	i dont know about partition im on ubuntu live test
<jeffree>	RayTracer: interesting
<jeffree>	yum is deprecated right?
<RayTracer>	they're heading to dnf
*	raymondh- is now known as raymondhim
<RayTracer>	but as long as yum is there, I use it :)
<bizarrefish>	Hi all
<bizarrefish>	When I use unshare -n to create a new network namespace, is there a way I can actually 'ip netns' that namespace from the 'outer' one, so I could add a tunnel interface to it?
<saptech>	well, to solve my partition problem. I just made the new partition a primary part instead of adding it to the extension
<Luke-Jr>	is there a way to pivot a mount? so open files get moved to a different partition? or am I going to have to reboot to move /home?
<[R]>	moved to a differnet partition? that makes no sense
<[R]>	if the partition table and/or the partiion is in use, you can't touch it
<Luke-Jr>	I have a failing hard drive. I want to format a new one (already installed) and move my data. That's simple enough - but I'm unclear on if there's a way to move the open files so I can avoid rebooting
<Luke-Jr>	so Xorg's .xsession-errors gets reopened onto the new drive
<Luke-Jr>	I suppose I could script gdb to attach, close fds, sync the data one last time, then reopen .. but that's a bit of effort, and maybe someone has already done it?
<[R]>	lol
<[R]>	you shoudl never do anyting liek taht with a running system, evven if you could
<Luke-Jr>	why?
<[R]>	because the files are in use...
<[R]>	and random fies could be written to at any time
<Luke-Jr>	hence pausing the process(es) while you do the final step
<[R]>	lol
<[R]>	OR you jsut reboot beacuse thats the sane thing to do
<Loshki>	Luke-Jr: that said, it will probably work, as linux doesn't lock in-use files the way windows does. If the new copy checks out, you're probably fine.
<[R]>	and/or logout and log in as rot and unmount it
<Luke-Jr>	fine, different question: is it reasonable to use btrfs yet? or do I risk data loss?
<ayecee>	Luke-Jr: it's reasonable. it's even common.
<Luke-Jr>	any minimum kernel version?
<ayecee>	yes, but the minimum is a kernel version that came out many years ago.
<stupid-1>	i'm a phony ...i'm ju8st a old timer..ive only bin into linux for about 12 years..i started with redhat about 12 years ago...most of my time was in the pool room..but i did have a tandy sx 1000..that was my first computer...i can mess any thing up..

<Fun>	what is linux made off?
<mrpi64>	?
<RayTracer>	Fun: pure awesomeness
<Fun>	I am using it now however would be good to know a bit more
<Fun>	:)
<Fun>	what is kernel for example?
<CHVNX>	Serious question: If an apple a day keeps The Doctor away why don't the Daleks just carry apples with them?
<Fun>	basic os that loads required drivers? :D
<Fun>	keep doctor away could mean doctor wont be able to help u

<mrpi64>	@RayTracer - thanks, I'll take a look
<Fun>	*dead lol
<ayecee>	CHVNX: this is why we can't have serious questions
<Fun>	ayecee: so when I start linux kernel loads itself and then loads rest?
<Loshki>	stupid-1: QA is a good career for someone who can mess up anything...
<ayecee>	Fun: what?
<RayTracer>	Fun: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_startup_process
<ayecee>	Fun: that was kind of out of the blue.
<Fun>	Booting a Linux installation involves multiple stages and software components, including firmware initialization, execution of a boot loader, loading and startup of a Linux kernel image, and execution of various startup scripts and daemons.
<Fun>	linux is a image of life
<Fun>	kinda :D
<mrpi64>	@RayTracer - sorted, thanks ;-)
<LMNOP__>	when i wake up its kinda like linux
<ayecee>	Fun: are you and stupid-1 sharing a keyboard?
<Fun>	ayecee when u born process is similar to linux start

<RayTracer>	Fun: I think linux is less pain than birth
<RayTracer>	yw
<bizarrefish>	RayTracer: Not when working with nasty vendor-supplied drivers :/
<Fun>	The BIOS performs startup tasks specific to the actual hardware platform. - thats dna setup

<[R]>	of course!
*	iflema_ is now known as iflema
<mrpi64>	and i though this was going to be a sensible channel
<mrpi64>	@Trinity - it shouldn't
<RayTracer>	yay.. we're using 64bit cpus now so there's plenty of permission bits free
<RayTracer>	wth..
<mrpi64>	@Trinity why would you need 9 bit?
<bizarefish>	in fact all code lies in space so space is good
<Trinity>	mrpi64, rxw rxw rxw?
<[R]>	Trinity: thats not 9 bits
<mrpi64>	should be ok and not slow it down
<RayTracer>	bizarefish: too sad it doesn't even tell the truth in space.. bad code!
<pantato>	.
<mrpi64>	ok, so not a very sensible channel
<Foxhoundz>	Does linux have a utility to search source code text?
<Foxhoundz>	e.g. find files that contain function x
<bizarefish>	yes
<Foxhoundz>	for programming language y
<bizarefish>	grep and likes
<Foxhoundz>	oh?
<mrpi64>	@Foxhoundz use grep
<Foxhoundz>	well grep is a full text/regex engine
<bizarefish>	grep -r infinity common sense :D
<Foxhoundz>	I'm talking about searching for specific programmatic constructs instead of text/pattner matching
<Foxhoundz>	u_u
<Trinity>	oh wait its an octal
<Trinity>	lol. nvmd
<Foxhoundz>	pattern*
<mrpi64>	@Foxhoundz that may rquire another tool
<SoItBegins>	Programmatic constructs?
<bizarefish>	RayTracer: way to be enlightened  cd .. and repeat till it happen :D
<SoItBegins>	How so?
<RayTracer>	Trinity: just in the rare case you weren't joking.. the permissions are not 9 bit, in theory permission slows the system down, but everybody judges permission handling worth more than the small overhead it causes
<Foxhoundz>	 SoItBegins, finding matching files based on functions, class names, variables, and the like
<Foxhoundz>	and perhaps gettnig a result count of where they appear
<Trinity>	RayTracer, what if one of the permissions governs file locking?
<Foxhoundz>	etc.
<spreeuw>	It's Happening
<Foxhoundz>	spreeuw: oh god already?
<RayTracer>	Trinity: afaik there is no permission related to locking.. just the usual unix permissions rwx, or posix acls if you need them
<bizarefish>	bizarrefish: are u stuck in matrix thinking u are programmer? lol
<bizarefish>	I do like Linux its pretty neat

<murrdawg>	I have a 1 TB hard drive, used 20GB of it for the OS, but I don't know how to properly mount the other 920 GB of it
<EriC^>	murrdawg: does it have a filesystem?
<[R]>	why did you only create a 20gb partition if you wanted to use the whole drive?
<murrdawg>	Because I can use the other 920GB for data only, and not OS
<murrdawg>	I have two other SATA hard drives I'll be adding after
<RayTracer>	murrdawg: I'm happily using LVM for managing disk space, and consider it useful in almost every case.. but you can also just add a partition and use it
<Fun>	yes

<murrdawg>	http://linuxhomeserverguide.com/server-config/Webmin.php
<Psi-Jack>	Before running a server, you should understand the basics of Linux itself.
<daspence>	what can I do to find out what may be wrong with my boot? I'm getting a kernel panic booting into emergency mode
<Psi-Jack>	Learn to walk before running.
<murrdawg>	I did a bit of playing around on Linux in university
<ohcanada>	university. i'm impressed
<RayTracer>	murrdawg: the steps are: 1) lay out your block devices 2) make a file system on it 3) mount the file system to a mount point (directory) 4) use the directory
<daspence>	what logs can I look at that might help direct me to the right place?
<bizarrefish>	murrdawg: Disks are 'block devices'. Partition table at the front of the disk describes partitions' Linux kernel reads table and generates block devices for each partition.
<RayTracer>	daspence: the output of the kernel panic message should give you a hint
<bizarrefish>	Block devices can have a filesystem installed on them and then be mounted
<daspence>	RayTracer: there is no real output, the entire computer freezes and the only way to reboot is by taking out my laptop batter and unplugging the power source
<murrdawg>	Ok, so when I try to create a file system on the second part of the hard drive I get this: Warning: Unable to open /dev/sr0 read-write (Read-only file system).  /dev/sr0 has been opened read-only.
<daspence>	it starts loading something and then kernel panic
<ohcanada>	daspence: try /var/log/messages. in fact have a look in /var/log with ls -l or whatever and look carefully at the mtimes there
<bizarrefish>	murrdawg: /dev/sr0 is your CD drive
<bizarrefish>	murrdawg: and is therefore read-only
<RayTracer>	daspence: a kernel panic message usually contains information about why it panics.. like http://i.imgur.com/fuH1F.png
<ohcanada>	daspence: when did all this badness happen? have you been messing around with your own kernel or initrd?
<murrdawg>	bizarrefish: I was going through webmin, and I selected to create a filesystem on the second half of the SATA drive, so why does it want to do sr0?
<daspence>	ohcanada: a few weeks ago
<ohcanada>	daspence: clearly you may have to use a rescue disk or usb, if your regular on-disk grub boot is broken
<bizarrefish>	murrdawg: Are you sure that's actually an error. it could just be a 'btw'. Linux usually just spits that out when you mount a CD drive, iirc.
<daspence>	I"m on a liveusb right now
<ohcanada>	daspence: what did you do, to occasion this brokenness?
<bizarrefish>	murrdawg: It's probably an unrelated message. I've never used webmin, so can't really help with it.
<[R]>	people still use webmin? haha
<RayTracer>	[R]: do you know alternatives (besides pure cli)?
<[R]>	lol
<ohcanada>	and linux just breaks itself, kinda like spontaneous combustion. it is *never* the fault of inept users
<murrdawg>	[R] I'm only following the userguide lol
*	ItsLuke is now known as Guest49013
<murrdawg>	bizarrefish: So I guess I have to mount it then if it has been created
<Fun>	ohcanada: how dare you to hint users may be at fault! :D
<shadok>	RayTracer: cpanel is bad too if you like that
<Fun>	users are holy cow
<RayTracer>	[R]: there is cockpit, looks nice but has very limited functionality atm
<daspence>	ohcanada: it started when I let my windows ssd go to standby, yanked that out without thinking, swapped to my linux ssd and then booted only to find the previously loaded information (netflix) to still be up - shortly thereafter I received a bsod (while my linux ssd was inserted) and then when the computer rebooted, I couldn't load my current version and couldn't get into emergency mode
<Fun>	webmin I used it and its crap but I understand it offers some easy functionality for newbie people
<Delf>	Is there a way to throttle io for storage?
<daspence>	netflix and chrome and one other tab were still loaded into ram when I put my linux ssd into my laptop - I didn't clear anything
<bizarrefish>	murrdawg: yeah. Or if you're using LVM, I believe you have to add it to the LVM group. LVM sits in front of block devices, providing virtual block devices which are backed by those real ones. LVM will offer some way to add a block device to the group.
<shadok>	Delf: ionice could be a starting point
<daspence>	what I will have to do, is reboot shortly, and save any error logs to a separate location
<daspence>	or take a picture
<RayTracer>	daspence: your resumed windows probably has overwritten some sectors of the ssd, so you might have corrupted files there
<bizarrefish>	murrdawg: The LVM-provided virtual block device is the thing with the filesystem on it. I've never used it, but I'm guessing you can't just add a block device to an LVM group, and your filesystem magically gets bigger. Probably need to reformat.
<Delf>	shadok: Seems to be exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!
<ohcanada>	Fun: i'd go further than that. some linux users are feckless
<shadok>	daspence: or mount you /var/log partition and get the logs
<shadok>	Delf: cool :)
<murrdawg>	bizarrefish: I have no problems reformatting the second partition of the hard drive. I guess there's no absolute user guide for setting up a linux server properly?
<bizarrefish>	murrdawg: Things like ZFS and Btrfs permit actual dynamic resizing/storage pooling without the need to reformat, btw.
<daspence>	RayTracer: that's what I'm thinking. shadok, mount /var/log /mnt/whatever?
*	Guest49013 is now known as Eclipse
<shadok>	daspence: yup, you should have the log in kern.log or kern.debug (or somewhere, it depends on the distro)
<daspence>	errr, the ssd is installed now. I'll have to look for the ssd
<RayTracer>	daspence: to verify, you probably need to mount & chroot, and run some verification (like rpm -Va), and eventually reinstall the packages where the binaries don't match the checksum
<ohcanada>	quicker to reinstall, in my experience
<RayTracer>	depends on what's on the ssd, if reinstall is no issue go ahead.. schoolbook answer would be "do a bare metal restore of your latest backup"
<docmur>	When I preform iptables -S I see lines that say -P INPUT ACCEPT and -P INPUT OUTPUT what do those mean?
<daspence>	yes ohcanada but I'm trying to get my hands real dirty learning some linux
<ohcanada>	docmur: default policy
<daspence>	how can I find the disks again? lspci?
<daspence>	no, that's going to list pci devices
<docmur>	so that means accept everything by default
<ayecee>	docmur: that's what happens if a packet gets to the end of a chain and hasn't matched anything.
<RayTracer>	daspence: cat /proc/partititons, lsblk, blkid..
<[R]>	ayecee: that's what she saaid
<ohcanada>	docmur: accuracy is everything. does it really say -P INPUT OUTPUT
<docmur>	-P INPUT ACCEPT
<docmur>	and -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
<Nomaska>	I'm installing Ubuntu through a VBox installation, does anyone know how to speed up my mouse? My mouse takes five or six seconds to move across the screen.
<ohcanada>	docmur: well as you may haver guessed. that means accept all incoming and allow all outgoing
<Loshki>	Nomaska: install the vbox guest additions...
<RayTracer>	murrdawg: what will the server be used for?
<docmur>	ya okay, just double checking
<murrdawg>	file/media server
<ohcanada>	docmur: it is inconceivable that a new user will be able to understand iptables, without reading stacks and stacks of examples and man pages. you prolly want to install and use gufw or some such, to make life simple, to start with
<ohcanada>	do they still have firestarter? that used to be a good simple gui firewall front-end
<CHVNX>	gufw
<RayTracer>	murrdawg: files served via smb, nfs, http, dlna, ...? maybe you can grab a tutorial for what you try to achieve from somewhere
<murrdawg>	Um..... served over the network so I can view it via network on my windows machine and grab the files?
<shadok>	murrdawg: samba aka CIFS then
<CHVNX>	Avoid ##chat, I was banned for posting an image from the NYTimes without warning. Ruby, much like the other little Hitlers in that channel, is an irrational fool.
<ayecee>	CHVNX: i feel like there's two sides to that story.
<ayecee>	at least.
<CHVNX>	ayecee: Go check the logs.
<murrdawg>	shadok: yes, I was thinking samba, but I have to set up the hard disks first
<CHVNX>	See for yourself.
<ayecee>	CHVNX: i'll get right on that.
<CHVNX>	ayecee: I bet you will.
<shadok>	CHVNX: given i didn't know that channel existed after thirteen years here i suppose i didn't miss much anyway
<CHVNX>	Always the doubter, never willing to confirm.
<shadok>	CHVNX: "that is not a linux topic" :D
<ayecee>	^
<CHVNX>	ayecee: This is why we can't have nice things.
<RayTracer>	murrdawg: I (as a fan of LVM) would recommend making separate logical volumes for audio, video, pictures, .. but other people like more the "throw everything at one place" philosophy.. which do you prefer?
<ayecee>	if nice things consist of whining about other channels, i can do without nice things.
<murrdawg>	RayTracer: yes, that is what I'm looking at, is the separate logical volumes
<RayTracer>	murrdawg: can you pastebin the output of "fdisk -l" and "cat /proc/partitions" somewhere, then I can provide you with the commands to set up LVM volumes
<shadok>	RayTracer: everything in one place, unless you have some media types needing a few millions of little files and others needing a few millions of hundreds gigabytes files at the same type there is no advantage to have separate FS
<shadok>	s/at the same type/at the same time/
<RayTracer>	shadok: do as you like.. I was asking murrdawg :)
<shadok>	RayTracer: ask in private if you don't want any advice
<shadok>	or create a filesystem for each movie and album you have, it's funjnier this way i heard
<murrdawg>	RayTracer: will do as soon as I can figure out how to copy and paste from putty
<ayecee>	murrdawg: highlight automatically copies, right-click pastes
<ayecee>	murrdawg: not exactly intuitive
<murrdawg>	RayTracer: http://pastebin.com/1eWFkLbQ
<RayTracer>	murrdawg: please re-execute as root. also, all following commands will need to be executed as root.. so "sudo -i"
<RayTracer>	murrdawg: and, you're already using LVM - add the commands "pvs" and "lvs" to the list
<murrdawg>	RayTracer: I just did this one: http://pastebin.com/jLnFVRLB
<murrdawg>	RayTracer: and this one: http://pastebin.com/e1RdhCJz
<LMNOP__>	already lvm
<LMNOP__>	dont you use tht normally to span disks?
<LMNOP__>	dunno...
<stupid-1>	i have fedora 21 on my computer with gnome..now i just install kde and its c000L..i'm happy because my chess program is now working..kde is still really coool..you can customize kde really easy..that make me happy....fedora is one of the best distro they have....C00000L as ducks
<RayTracer>	murrdawg: so your /dev/sda is already LVM.. do you want to use /sdb and /sdc as well for the linux server or should they be preserved?
<ohcanada>	stupid-1: i thought drakes were cool, and ducks were red hot
<stupid-1>	ya
<tinwhiskers>	lvm on boot/system devices still scares me. great for your big data volumes though.
<stupid-1>	i;m a little stupid
<murrdawg>	RayTracer: /sdb and /sdc will be later as part of the linux server. They are currently ex-Fat with a bunch of data on them that I will have to transfer somewhere and transfer them back after LVM is implemented on them
<RayTracer>	LMNOP__: you can use lvm to span disks, but actually I wouldn't recommend it - if one disk breaks, you can't use any of the VG that have PV on that disk (yes there's --partial, but..)
<ohcanada>	stupid-1: aren't you the guy who declared bankrupt in the state of florida
<stupid-1>	ya
<stupid-1>	 that me
<stupid-1>	i'm broke
<stupid-1>	i cant pay my credit card bills
<tinwhiskers>	you can still raid with lvm though
<stupid-1>	i'm in a little trouble
<tinwhiskers>	spanning disks is what makes lvm awesome
<LMNOP__>	RayTracer, ok good point...
<stupid-1>	i have 5 credit card..can they out me in jail if i dont pay them
<RayTracer>	murrdawg: ok alright. /dev/sda is already filled with lvm, and the lv 'Media' is almost max size, so there's only few things that can be done if that layout already fits your needs
<murrdawg>	RayTracer: I made Media, but I want to be able to see it and access it from my windows machine
<RayTracer>	murrdawg: is it already mounted somewhere ("df -h" will tell)?
<LMNOP__>	tinwhiskers, yep
<tinwhiskers>	murrdawg: just share it via cifs/smb
<stupid-1>	i have 5 credit card..can they out me in jail if i dont pay them ..yes or no
<RayTracer>	tinwhiskers: actually I never used lvm mirroring, still sticking to good old md
<murrdawg>	RayTracer: nope. not listed.
<tinwhiskers>	stupid-1: out you?
<Nomaska>	Yes they can.
<stupid-1>	ya
<murrdawg>	tinwhiskers: as I described earlier, I'm a noob to the server world and the linux server... so I'm painfully learning how to set it up
<Loshki>	What does it mean to be "outed in jail"?
<tinwhiskers>	murrdawg: all good. wholeheartedly support you.
<stupid-1>	i might be on my way too jail...some peop[le say no
<ohcanada>	stupid-1: become an atf informant, and they will clear your debt
<stupid-1>	no
<stupid-1>	im not a cop
<murrdawg>	tinwhiskers: that being said... I need a little more of spoonfed info on how to share it.... I'm a Windows guy myself lol
<tinwhiskers>	stupid-1: if you go to jail will they still let you use irc?
<RayTracer>	murrdawg: grab your favourite editor and check if there is an entry for it in /etc/fstab; if not, make one like "/dev/ubuntu-vg/Media /srv/media auto defaults"
<stupid-1>	no
<stupid-1>	sorry
<murrdawg>	RayTracer: favourite editor through the terminal?
<ohcanada>	stupid-1: what about a talk show host with BPD?
<tinwhiskers>	murrdawg: oh, so you host all your data on your linux machine, set up the cifs service (windows file sharing) and then you can connect to it from your windows machine just like it was another windows machines.
<RayTracer>	murrdawg: I'd say vim, but I don't want to spend the next 2h explaining it.. maybe "nano /etc/fstab":)
<tinwhiskers>	Not so if you mean you want to dual-boot the same machine to windows though
<stupid-1>	half america is in dept..there just bug me to death

<daspence>	murrdawg: chmod 1777 filetobechanged
<RayTracer>	daspence: and btw, the log of the last paste ends Apr 24 05:15:35 - but I don't expect it to contain something useful anyways, as the boot stops before / and /var is mounted
<daspence>	that's very useful to me RayTracer; it lets me know that something is stopping the boot...
<daspence>	^not sarcasm
<daspence>	RayTracer when I try to umount /dev/sda3....I'm getting target in use...

<RayTracer>	murrdawg: great!
<daspence>	1977c isn't listed
<murrdawg>	RayTracer: now to figure out ex-fat, because if I can use them without have to copy files over and what not, that would be best haha
<RayTracer>	murrdawg: sure
<RayTracer>	daspence: I'd grep only for 1977 and omit the 'c'
<daspence>	I think terminal is using it
<daspence>	okay, got it umounted, about to run fsck RayTracer
<RayTracer>	daspence: good luck, I'd use -y in case there are errors
<daspence>	/dev/sda1 contains a file system with errors, check forced.
<daspence>	Resize inode not valid.  Recreate<y>? yes obviously, yes?
<RayTracer>	daspence: it will probably ask LOTS of these questions, therefore run fsck -y

<murrdawg>	RayTracer: almost success..... now it's asking for a username and password
<daspence>	RayTracer: I have run that on sda1 and sda3
<daspence>	RayTracer: anywhere to verify that everything is good ?
<murrdawg>	RayTracer: I can't, from Windows, seem to get what the user and password would be
<daspence>	I guess rebooting?

*	opa is now known as Guest82274
<daspence>	let me reboot and if all is well, then I will be back in a bit

<RayTracer>	murrdawg: there is no need to do it on windows, just "smbpasswd -a <your windows username>" with your windows password

<cykacykacyka>	shadok, the medical institution is using an MS vpn server, and that's what she has to connect to
<daspence>	RayTracer: did not work...still have issues. Tried to boot normally and system hangs at IPV6 ADDRCONF (NET_DEVCHANGE)
<daspence>	not sure if that means anything, but I'm going to read up on bind-mounting
<shadok>	cykacykacyka: sorry, i can't help you then, except telling you to look at google, i just found plenty of links talking about that in 5 seconds: https://www.nikhef.nl/~janjust/ppp/doc_pptp_clientsetup.html
<neonrooster>	Hello. What distro of Linux do I use to build Linux from Scratch? I'm using systemrescuecd but am having a little trouble. When I type "su - lfs" in the console, it shows a colorful prompt and that prompt is supposed to be black and white
<wh0isthis>	what text editor are you using?
<neonrooster>	wh0isthis: who? me?
<shadok>	neonrooster: yup
<cykacykacyka>	thanks anyway, shadok :)
<wh0isthis>	neonrooster: sure
<RayTracer>	daspence: you need to mount /dev /proc etc. to the respective places where your ssd is mounted, so you can chroot there and work with the system tools (like rpm) there.. like https://ask.fedoraproject.org/en/question/60906/problem-reinstalling-grub2-fedora-21/ 1st answer contains the bind mounts
<phogg>	neonrooster: it should work from any, mostly. The LFS book goes into detail on what you need
<phogg>	wh0isthis: why do you want to know?
<shadok>	cykacykacyka: no problem but you really should try to setup something secure rather than using some '90s protocol :)
<wh0isthis>	phogg: why not?
<RayTracer>	daspence: heading to bed now, good luck
<neonrooster>	phogg: here's my problem: the colorful PS1 means my environment is messed up
<phogg>	wh0isthis: We prefer specific questions with useful answers.
<wh0isthis>	phogg: say who?
<neonrooster>	so how do I make sure I set up the environment correctly?
<phogg>	neonrooster: Could be. Do you care to find out why, or just make it work?
<phogg>	neonrooster: And anyway, the colorful prompt won't make building LFS not work. It's just not a typical configuration.
<shadok>	wh0isthis: IRC says that, since three decades or so
<daspence>	thanks and have a good night RayTracer
<neonrooster>	I care to find out why
<phogg>	I really don't understand what problem there is
<wh0isthis>	whats the best text editor to use? and why?
<phogg>	neonrooster: Did you set your own PS1? Who did? Read you .profile, .bashrc, .bash_profile, /etc/profile and so on until you find where it's set.
<shadok>	wh0isthis: MINE!
<phogg>	wh0isthis: Emacs.
<phogg>	wh0isthis: Now that you have some useless answers would you care to ask a more specific question?
<neonrooster>	lfs@sysresccd ~ $ cat .bash_profile
<neonrooster>	exec env -i HOME=$HOME TERM=$TERM PS1='\u:\w\$ ' /bin/bash
<phogg>	neonrooster: Then it's not your PS1 that's setting colors
*	SoItBegins1 is now known as SoItBegins
<neonrooster>	phogg: something is because I tried "echo $PS1" and it has color escapes in it
<SoItBegins>	wh0isthis: gedit, GUI version.
<neonrooster>	it's as if ~lfs/.bash_profile is not read
<neonrooster>	I'm pretty sure that's the case
<shadok>	neonrooster: you could 'source'  it
<shadok>	source /path/to/your/file
<neonrooster>	ok I'm off to drink soda and code
<neonrooster>	no time for LFS
<neonrooster>	I've got one working computer I can code on
<shadok>	stop trying lfs or use a VM then :)
<neonrooster>	ahahah ok I install Fedora and use a virtual machine then
<cykacykacyka>	shadok, if I could force all of the independent business to use the protocols I wanted, 1 - things would be awesome, 2 - I'd be a dictator

<daspence>	shadok: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=b2ZS8e2k but the list goes on
<cykacykacyka>	shadok, a free citizen is free to choose a workplace that suits him, yes, but not everyone is educated enough to take the VPN protocol that's used in the workplace into consideration, especially if job is looking at samples from various places of a patient through a microscope to determine whether the patient in question has cancer or just hygene problems
<Psi-Jack>	cykacykacyka: Are you done with this subject matter of being off-topic?
<shadok>	cykacykacyka: i'm not sure you should (or even have the right) to setup a vpn in this case
<shadok>	Psi-Jack: that's openvpn/pptp stuff in this case afaik fyi (yeah, two acronyms in a row!)
<buttbutter>	What's the point of translating usernames into numeric user IDs on linux? I.e why not just use the username string?
*	EriC^ is now known as EriC^^
<cykacykacyka>	Psi-Jack, yes, I am, sorry
<Psi-Jack>	buttbutter: uid's are FAR smaller.
<Psi-Jack>	uid's are also much easier to compare numerically. :)
<buttbutter>	Psi-Jack: But it's not like a few character string is all that big >.>
<cykacykacyka>	and uid's are easier to map to resources
<buttbutter>	Oh, from a comparison standpoint that makes sense
<buttbutter>	cykacykacyka: Why is that?
<Psi-Jack>	buttbutter: 32 single object versus X number of variable 32 bit lengths is a far cry smaller.
<cykacykacyka>	because an integer is always a certain number of bits long
<buttbutter>	Hm. Alright.
<buttbutter>	Thanks. :D
<cykacykacyka>	you could create a hash map of both integers and strings, and even though a lookup for both would be doable in O(1), the lookup for an integer key is still faster
<shadok>	buttbutter: which encoding would you choose to compare strings? UTF-32? :p
<buttbutter>	shadok: Oh, that makes sense too.
<buttbutter>	So many reasons :D
<shadok>	buttbutter: and that way you couldn't have two users share the same uid (heresy!)
<xeon-enouf>	if you didn't use numeric IDs, everyone would confuse grub with root, and roots with grubs
<shadok>	Psi-Jack: how do i look on #freenode? ;)
<Psi-Jack>	...
<RingtailedFox>	what is a good uPNP/DLNA media server for Linux? i have Samsung Link/AllShare installed on my laptop but it's clunky as hell, and i'm not sure if plex will work with my samsung TV
<iJoshuaHD>	is this safe? sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=104857600,mode=1777 overflow /tmp
<Psi-Jack>	RingtailedFox: Plex, which has uPNP/DLNA support built-in, and even better, stop using a clunky as hell protocol and get something like a Roku or Apple TV which natively supports Plex.
<Psi-Jack>	And it's UPnP, not uPNP. :p
<iJoshuaHD>	i have to increase the /tmp space to over 100M because PHP is filling it up like pancakes
<Psi-Jack>	iJoshuaHD: Stop doing that. :p
<iJoshuaHD>	why?
<Psi-Jack>	Because, it's bad?
<iJoshuaHD>	PHP fills them up fast
<Psi-Jack>	Abusing your session/cookies with excessive amounts of data .
<Psi-Jack>	That's your actual problem. :p
<iJoshuaHD>	causing some parts not to work
<xeon-enouf>	iJoshuaHD: adjust the app logging/debugging settings/config
<iJoshuaHD>	im using a VPS well im not sure how to do that :/
<Psi-Jack>	So, learn.
<RingtailedFox>	sorry
<RingtailedFox>	so i would stream to the roku from my computer, or just hook up my external hard drive to the roku device?
<Psi-Jack>	RingtailedFox: Stream.
<ERBSE>	anyone known how to make linux ignore some dm-crypt partition when booting? my harddriver have a dm-crypt parition and it prevent booting
<Psi-Jack>	ERBSE: How does it "prevent booting?"
<ERBSE>	keeping sk password ..
<Psi-Jack>	And?
<SoItBegins>	So you want to boot from another partition?
<ERBSE>	^o^
<ERBSE>	I have password of / but not of /home
<Psi-Jack>	I mean. If your / is encrypted, you can't simply ignore it. :p
<ERBSE>	i use a usb to boot, but still ask password for /home
*	EriC^^ is now known as EriC^
<Psi-Jack>	What broken distro is this?
<ERBSE>	i think i have to use windows to remove that partition ...
<xeon-enouf>	ERBSE: perhaps you have an issue with settings in /etc/default/mdadm, or other files there; or... you'll need to edit and regenerate your initrd properly
<ERBSE>	centos 6
<Psi-Jack>	Okay, CentOS 6 isn't broken, just your setup is broken. :p
<xeon-enouf>	sysresccd.org is the go-to recovery disk
<ERBSE>	I have / and /home, I forget password of /home
<ERBSE>	then I can't boot anyway from linux
<Psi-Jack>	Wait, you just said /home isn't encrypted.
<shadok>	RingtailedFox: http://kodi.wiki/view/UPnP/Server
<xeon-enouf>	oh
<ERBSE>	no, I have two partition, home is encrypted, but I can't boot even into init 1
<xeon-enouf>	ERBSE: hrm, so don't mount /home ; edit fstab properly, to noauto?
<ERBSE>	I think the problem is crypttab
<xeon-enouf>	ERBSE: create another new user? and/or another /home partition you generate?
<ERBSE>	but I can't edit it, I just go for windows usb ... thanks your guys\
<xeon-enouf>	cryptsetup
<xeon-enouf>	using LUKS i presume
<Psi-Jack>	...
<Psi-Jack>	Heh
<xeon-enouf>	did you just forget your /home/user password?
<xeon-enouf>	ahh, yep
<ERBSE>	you can try it, add a luks partition enter a random password and add it to crypttab
<xeon-enouf>	hrm... so change the passwd ;-)
<ERBSE>	then you can't boot your linux anyway ^o^
<xeon-enouf>	ERBSE: ever root passwd can be altered; boot into init=/bin/sh
<xeon-enouf>	but don't alter root pass, heh; change home passwd
<xeon-enouf>	ERBSE: init 1 = single (runlevel 1, rcS.d/) ; init=/bin/bash, etc ... is even lower level
<xeon-enouf>	s/ever/even/
<ERBSE>	oh..... wow, xeon-enouf you are awesome
<ERBSE>	init=/bin/bash work
<ERBSE>	init 1 will ask password for evry partition in crypttab, but init=/bin/bash wont
<shadok>	Psi-Jack: i like you, see what #freenode is up to, their channel is full of trolls
<triceratux>	shadok: freenode is most specifically concerned with uk laws https://freenode.net/policy.shtml but the servers are located worldwide
<Psi-Jack>	shadok: That's nice. Since you're obviously going to be a troll yourself, I'ma say bye bye and apply the silence.
<shadok>	triceratux: that's the point, do they _only_ respect UK law eve though some servers are based elsewhere? how do they protect themselves from that
<shadok>	Psi-Jack: okay, do what you need to do, if you review your logs you may be changing side but that's your decision to make
<xeon-enouf>	ERBSE: if you care to know why, or explore, review src/init/main.c in kernel source
<shadok>	Psi-Jack: i'm here since 2003 or so, i like to help when i can, my questions about the legal status were genuine, that's all i can say
<xeon-enouf>	shadok: the feds don't care about states' rights ..sigh
<ERBSE>	xeon-enouf: hmm, really thank you, I'll check that file after I fix my system
<xeon-enouf>	ERBSE: welcome
<xeon-enouf>	imaginary boundaries matter not to the globalist psychopath fascists
<Psi-Jack>	shadok: Well, you got 9y on freenode, I have 13y. :)
<diemos>	Psi-Jack: about the same
<Psi-Jack>	Well, technically mine's still longer than 13 years, but that's all that nickserv goes back to for me. :/
<diemos>	I remember coming in here and learning more about linux than any class could teach me
<diemos>	Do nickserv registrations get deleted after dormancy?
<Psi-Jack>	diemos: They can, yes
<Psi-Jack>	But, not automatically.
<diemos>	Ah, I think I hadn't logged in for four or five years and realized after nickserv didn't yell at me.
<shadok>	Psi-Jack: i agree, after checking it i didn't register my nick at the time i got here, anyways if you silence/ban me keep in mind i never trolled here, that's your job and you have logs
<triceratux>	shadok: things still arent that nasty yet on the net. its assumed if youre savvy enough to get to irc youre savvy enough to have some nuance & respect, for the benefit of all. "illegal" stuff is all over the web where it belongs.
<shadok>	diemos: yup, the faq gives a limit after which you can request a nick if it wasn't used (logged in)
<triceratux>	but ianl. dont listen to me; listen to xeon-en0uf :)
<xeon-enouf>	shadok: Psi-Jack is relegated to plebe status as of some time ago
<xeon-enouf>	shadok: don't worry about him, other than him filing nonsensical complaints in the -ops channel
<xeon-enouf>	triceratux: ianal! :-P
<diemos>	I'm just quite happy to have seen IRC keep growing in use.
<xeon-enouf>	and 0 isn't a letter :-)
<xeon-enouf>	you know better
<shadok>	triceratux: my questions were about the "real problems", is something legal in some jurisdiction legal here, and why? in case of a trial that reaaly counts and appreciation is not something you can defend
<xeon-enouf>	but i
<xeon-enouf>	er... nvm
<xeon-enouf>	shadok: there's a channel called groklaw or a mail list of somesuch ... maybe #gnu can also be of guidance, heh
<shadok>	xeon-enouf: the guys in charge have the power, that's all i know and i abide by that, i haven't much choice if i'm not an OP
<xeon-enouf>	shadok: well, that too -- but this (freenode, or any IRC) is such a small microcosm of the real issues
<dasabhi>	hello i am having trouble cross compiling a linux kerenel for the rpi
<xeon-enouf>	and being a channel-op != freenode staff  (there's the whole political factors there too)
<shadok>	xeon-enouf: but the groklaw website seemingly closed two years ago, and they were only reporting on legal cases, they are not the law themselves
<xeon-enouf>	er necessarily, i mean
<dasabhi>	i keep getting an error that says i am missing mach.h files
<xeon-enouf>	shadok: ok
<dasabhi>	does any one know how to fix this issue?
<xeon-enouf>	now, handling linux issues always comes first here; so... let's see if we can help dasabhi
<shadok>	xeon-enouf: but good call on #groklaw, i didn't know they had a chan here
<triceratux>	shadok: hang on freedominion or glp to see what transnational trolling begets. believe me the envelope is being pushed. we gnu/linux technocrats dont need the headaches
<xeon-enouf>	dasabhi: mach.h? is that OS X related?
<dasabhi>	xeon-enouf: no i am cross compiling on ubuntu
<dasabhi>	i had a linux directory with the source code for the kernel
<xeon-enouf>	oh, for the RPi
<dasabhi>	and i am trying to compile it for the rpi
<xeon-enouf>	please don't use ENTER for a comma ;-)
<shadok>	xeon-enouf: err, there is no #groklaw chan as far as i can see
<xeon-enouf>	apt-file search mach.h shows me a few files
<xeon-enouf>	shadok: well, there was, or maybe on another network
<xeon-enouf>	maybe oftc; or ..just maybe it went away
<shadok>	i'll check that but i would have liked a semi-official answer from freenode, as that where we all are
<xeon-enouf>	triceratux: technocracy isn't a very becoming feature
<shadok>	*that is
<xeon-enouf>	dasabhi: asked in #raspberry ? or #rpi , or whatever?
<xeon-enouf>	dasabhi: what tool-chain are you using? crosstool?
<dasabhi>	xeon-enouf: i am cross compiling for the raspberry pi
<dasabhi>	xeon-enouf: i think its ncurses?
<xeon-enouf>	that's not a toolchain ;-)
<dasabhi>	xeon-enouf: not too sure i got something from git hub which was used for raspberry pis
<xeon-enouf>	ncurses gives you a TUI
<dasabhi>	how do i find this name for you xeon?
<xeon-enouf>	dasabhi: perhaps something like raspbian might be more apropos?
<xeon-enouf>	a debian derivative
<triceratux>	shadok: technocracy in the generic sense of "what works, rules", as it has the most value. i admit im still a utopian, & i hear what youre saying
<xeon-enouf>	dasabhi: it's not important, for now
<triceratux>	oops xeon-enouf ^^
<xeon-enouf>	triceratux: economic control of the world's resources through technical knowledge, and occultism
<shadok>	triceratux: i understand, the problem is you don't know what freenode stand for and i find it pretty unsettling
<triceratux>	shadok: the net is a wild place. in fact you dont really know what anything stands for. the witchhunt dynamic is still best sudied on the fora. but this is way ot for this channel anyway
<dasabhi>	xeon-enouf: yup problem is still here
<dasabhi>	xeon-enouf: i tried getting the directory again
<dasabhi>	xeon-enouf: as i deleted it and downloaded it again and got a different version of the kernel, but still nothing.
<dasabhi>	xeon-enouf: the exact error i am seeing is drivers/cpufreq/bcm2835-cpufreq.c:29:23: fatal error: mach/vcio.h: No such file or directory
<dasabhi>	 #include <mach/vcio.h>
<dasabhi>	                       ^
<shadok>	triceratux: the main is i can"t get booted off the net, but i can can get banned from this channel and (conceivably) from this network, that's the proble and i'd love to have someone to talk to about what i can and i cannot do
<dasabhi>	compilation terminated.
<dasabhi>	make[2]: *** [drivers/cpufreq/bcm2835-cpufreq.o] Error 1

<popsch>	how can I connect to an IPV6 address on my local subnet? 'ip addr show' tells me that I have both, an IPv4 and an IPv6 address bound to my wlan address. when I type in the IPv6 address in the browser, it goes to google and searches for it as a string. Telnet also doesn't work
<shadok>	triceratux: ok, i'm drunk, given how i write it's pretty obvious but i reallt am interested in the legal status of freenode and their chans given theyr are hosted all around the world
<triceratux>	shadok: no fear. find the ops channel when youre a bit more sober. all i can say is the letter killeth. youre starting to sound like a patent troll tho
<Selinda>	Anyone using Arch linux without any GUI?
<ayecee>	popsch: how are you entering it as an url?
<ayecee>	popsch: like, what's the url?
<shadok>	triceratux: patent trolls are a good way to illustrate the problem though, "legal stuff all the way" was the root of my questions on #freenode and i didn't get any meaningful answer
<popsch>	ayecee, the router tells me this as the address that dhcpv6 gave it: fde5:6299:5b87::499/128
<ayecee>	popsch: so what did you put in the browser?
<popsch>	ayecee, exactly that address
<popsch>	the same string
<ayecee>	popsch: does it work if you leave out the /128 ?
<xeon-enouf>	ipv6 CIDR? O_o
<popsch>	ayecee, still goes to google
<popsch>	I use openwrt and can connect to the router via 192.168.1.1 in the browser
<ayecee>	popsch: how about http://fde5:6299:5b87::499 ?
<popsch>	ayecee, that's what I tried
<xeon-enouf>	popsch: ipv6 would need to be supported via all ; app, ISP, wlan, router, etc...
<stanford_drone>	Our startup got funded! We're building a personal gaming flying robot. Does anyone know computer vision or Artificial Intelligence? Do you want to come to shenzhen, china from July to October, and work with us?
<ayecee>	popsch: which browser?
<ayecee>	popsch: also, can you ping6 that address?
<triceratux>	shadok: tbh many netizens are beyond that & are sick of it. theres more pressing things to concentrate on. the rights of man are so 18th century. the net is a private infrastructure & its a privilege to be here
<popsch>	ayecee, yes
<ayecee>	popsch: which browser?
<xeon-enouf>	triceratux: haha ... you sound like a darpa schill
<popsch>	I tried in firefox and chromium
<Selinda>	Guys, is it stupid do use Arch linux without X Window?
<popsch>	now also chrome, same result
<xeon-enouf>	triceratux: the DANs are what will thrive. .. see outernet.is for one
<shadok>	ayecee: given freenode is a cluster and based in many countries a i was legitimately wonder what laws they had to respect and the answer seems to be very complicated
<ayecee>	popsch: ah, google says the format is http://[2001:4860:0:2001::68]/
<triceratux>	xeon-enouf: tyvm. "troll to learn, dont learn to troll" :)
<xeon-enouf>	shadok: the globalist elitist agenda law; know one thing; laws don
<ayecee>	so, http://[fde5:6299:5b87::499]/
<shadok>	triceratux: i totally on your side on this point, problem is: "what happens if country X launches an investigation into some random channel?"
<xeon-enouf>	t apply to those who control global laws/currencies/economies
<popsch>	ayecee, interesting. it says: err_name_not_resolved
<ayecee>	shadok: go home, you're drunk
<popsch>	but I can use "telnet -6 fde5:6299:5b87::499 80" to connect to the web server
<ayecee>	popsch: hmm. i guess that url format isn't the whole story.
<pclover>	popsch, http://[ipv6address]
<popsch>	how come "telnet -6 ..." can connect, but the browser cannot
<ayecee>	pclover: right, and i also get a dns resolver error when i try that.
<xeon-enouf>	do the : need to be escaped? :-P
<xeon-enouf>	as in \:
<popsch>	nice. firefox can
<ayecee>	popsch: oh, it works in firefox?
<ayecee>	i was trying in chrome
<popsch>	yes, but not in chromium
<Foxhoundz>	Dear god, people still use Firefox?
<pclover>	works in chrome for me
<popsch>	and not in chrome
<shadok>	ayecee: i'm home and i'm not drunk enough to be unable to talk here, (remember english is not my first language, if i'm able to write something in english that means i'm not drunk enough ^^)
<xeon-enouf>	heh
<ayecee>	shadok: drunk enough to defend yourself to people who weren't even talking with you.
<xeon-enouf>	ayecee: focus gwasshoppah
<pclover>	i just put a v6 address in brakcets
<pclover>	brackets in chrome and it works for me
<pclover>	tho this is chrome on windows
<xeon-enouf>	chromium, or google-chrome? or .. sigh chromeOS, heh
<ayecee>	pclover: hmm. it didn't work for me in chromium on linux. i wonder if that's the difference?
<xeon-enouf>	ewww
<shadok>	ayecee: let me review that, i'll get back to you in five minutes (and sorry if this happened to you by the way ^^=
<pclover>	ayecee, perhaps it behaves differently. GIve me a second and i'll try
<pclover>	on debian
<xeon-enouf>	thanks for playing; chrome on windows ; windows has all sorts of ipv4<->ipv6 tunneling/wrapping
<pclover>	xeon-enouf, i have native v6
<pclover>	and disabled the tunnel stuff
<xeon-enouf>	i don't care; the firewalling on windows ultimate shows what i mean
<xeon-enouf>	you have services running, that you don't even know
<xeon-enouf>	but sigh -- this isn't ##windows
<shadok>	ayecee: i'm drunk enough to see you talked to me and i answered, what were you talking about when you said "drunk enough to defend yourself to people who weren't even talking with you."?
<pclover>	what's the tool again on debain based system to install a deb package and resolve deps?
<pclover>	gedbi or something
<CHVNX>	pclover: apt. apt-get, aptitude, or dpkg
<CHVNX>	gdebi works, as well.
<pclover>	gdebi that's what i was looking for
<pclover>	apt-get wont install the deps in a single command
<shadok>	pclover: apt-get or aptitude will install deps, for suggested package it depends on your configuration of apt
<shadok>	dpkg on the other end won't install deps
<xeon-enouf>	wtf?
<xeon-enouf>	apt-get install -f   #to fix broken; apt-get works fine ...if you didn't break it
<xeon-enouf>	resolve deps, heh
<pclover>	that involves an extra strep
<pclover>	apt-get can't install packages manually from a URL. not sure about aptitude
<pclover>	on systems with yum i could just go yum install URL or file location to RPM and it does the rest
<Onionnion>	Anyone know of a good guide on using tar to do full-system incremental backups?
<shadok>	pclover: try apt-get install kde-desktop if you're on debian, the dependencies will get pulled automatically
<pclover>	shadok, but if i'm installing a deb manually it wont
<shadok>	Onionnion: rsnapshot is the way to go
<pclover>	you have to use dpkg than apt-get
<Onionnion>	shadok, haven't heard of it
<pclover>	since apt-get can't install debs and resolve deps in on go iirc
<pclover>	gedbi solves the problem tho
<xeon-enouf>	why are you installing a .deb?
<pclover>	gdebi
<shadok>	pclover: if you are instaling 'manually' you should know what's going on
<xeon-enouf>	duh
<booboy>	shadok +1 thumbs up for rsnapshot. great utility, saves lots of space.
<pclover>	xeon-enouf, chrome
<xeon-enouf>	pclover: erm.. no
<pclover>	after you install the deb it adds a repo
<xeon-enouf>	pclover: install chromium ; or add the silly google-chrome repo to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/NN-google-*
<shadok>	booboy: yup
<Onionnion>	Not so much looking to save space, mostly trying to produce a full system backup before running a major release upgrade, space isn't a problem as I'm just putting it onto an external drive
<pclover>	xeon-enouf, and once it installs apt bitches about there being duplicate entires
<xeon-enouf>	pclover: chromium is the F/LOSS version
<shadok>	Onionnion: look at clonezilla for a full system backup
<shadok>	Onionnion: or "dd" if you want to waste time :)
<Onionnion>	lol that'd take forever
<xeon-enouf>	Onionnion: look into rsnapshot, rdiff-backup
<xeon-enouf>	Onionnion: there are frontend tools that utilize those
<pclover>	xeon-enouf, tho chromium isn't the same as chrome
<xeon-enouf>	pclover: and for good reason
<shadok>	Onionnion: have a look at apt-clone too
<Onionnion>	frontend as-in gui? as I have not a DE installed on this server
<xeon-enouf>	well perhaps they are CLI frontends i mentioned; but no, frontend in tools that use those backends to accomplish the rsync tasks,
<xeon-enouf>	as in dirvish, et al (which is no longer maintained)
<pclover>	ayecee, chrome on debian is working with it
<Selinda>	What are the two popped up terminals when running arch?
<xeon-enouf>	but, tar'ring and gz'ing is a good way to backup important dirs/
<Selinda>	Also, anyone using Arch only with like blackbox ?
<xeon-enouf>	Selinda: tarts?

<pclover>	how does the xfs backup feature work?
<pclover>	anybody use it?
<xeon-enouf>	(KDE, GNOME, XFCE, LXDE...)
<pclover>	xfsdump
<xeon-enouf>	I'm sure it's well documented
<shadok>	pclover: not much but i used xfsdump a few times
<Selinda>	xeon-enouf, You just go with the default or something like blackbox and "startx" ?
<pclover>	no issues shadok ?
<xeon-enouf>	Selinda: the latter; but i use openbox when i do
<xeon-enouf>	Selinda: i have never used archlinux, personally
<shadok>	pclover: none at all as far as i can remember, you better say which issues you had to get help though
<Selinda>	xeon-enouf, Oh ok. Was more referring to the GUI itself.
<pclover>	shadok, probably would be better than using rsync
<xeon-enouf>	Onionnion: debootstrap, ..and many other options exist, for you to simulate, or try out a full upgrade
<shadok>	pclover: that's not the same thing at all, in one case you are cloning a filesystem, in the other one you are copying files
<xeon-enouf>	Selinda: what about the GUI? you mean Xorg?
<pclover>	shadok, true but i like that idea better
<Selinda>	xeon-enouf, Yes.
<shadok>	pclover: that's your right :)
<pingfloyd>	The gui is too gooey
<xeon-enouf>	Selinda: your first statement makes no sense to me; Two popped up terminals
<xeon-enouf>	Selinda: ok -- no idea
<CHVNX>	http://www.playwithlua.com/?p=60
<pclover>	shadok, I suspect you can mount xfs dumps?
<Selinda>	xeon-enouf, What are you using?
<xeon-enouf>	Selinda: debian ..until the systemd monster encroaches too much
<shadok>	pclover: interesting question but i never tried it
<pclover>	all the distrso will switch to ti eventually
<pclover>	most of the major ones have afik
<pingfloyd>	xeon-enouf:  what you got against  the systemd operating system?
<pclover>	i've not had too many issues with it.
<pclover>	It's been working for me for the most part
<xeon-enouf>	pingfloyd: heh ..sssshhhh
<pingfloyd>	On jessy I had a strange and concerning situation where my bash history was completely gone one day
<xeon-enouf>	pclover: the nsa is also working properly
<shadok>	pclover: i really like xfs too but you can't shrink an FS with it, that's not great imho
<pclover>	true that is annoying
<pclover>	but not a problem for me
<xeon-enouf>	pclover: GNU code violations (i.e., theft) kind of bothers me
<shadok>	anyway, i have to go, night guys!
<xeon-enouf>	ciao bella

*	yo is now known as Guest40850
<daspence>	how can I write a bash script that grabs which mounted device is being unmounted?
<pingfloyd>	Grab?
<toothe>	don't follow your questin.
<toothe>	question*
<pingfloyd>	Me neither
<[R]>	daspence: "being unmounted"?
*	[R] grabs pingfloyd 
<toothe>	i'm having an incredible amount of time finding how the hell to use maildrop...
<[R]>	toothe: atleast it's incredible
<toothe>	lol
<[R]>	toothe: do you gotta drop it like it's hot?
<pingfloyd>	Please be concise about what you're trying to do exactly
<toothe>	nah, i gotta shake what ya mama gave ya to the Spam folder.
<daspence>	[R]: I'm trying to write a bash script that will unmount devices that are mounted, and verbose the process
<daspence>	or at least say, "device x unmounted" after it being done
<[R]>	daspence: ok, you're getting closer to making sense...
<pingfloyd>	Like printing a message to stdout?
<[R]>	daspence: first line is umount, second line is echo
<daspence>	yes, I have those.
<pingfloyd>	You can use printf or echo for that
<daspence>	do y'all have any sites for good bash tuts?
<pingfloyd>	Yep, it is that simple to do, you probably want unmount... && echo message
<pingfloyd>	So it only echoes on success of unmount
<pingfloyd>	daspence: look for greg's bash faq
<pingfloyd>	Also #bash is good source
<pingfloyd>	That's a good channel imo
<daspence>	on yt?
<CHVNX>	http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ
<daspence>	thanks CHVNX pingfloyd and [R]
*	toothe if frustrated.
<pingfloyd>	Np
<toothe>	there are at least two things I want to figure out how to do, and I can't find any documents or guides on it.
<tubaman>	toothe: let's start with one :) what are you trying to do?
<toothe>	basically, any email that comes in, I want to encrypt it
<toothe>	tubaman: Usually when I can't find something online and I figure it out, I write a document on it :-)
<Joufflu>	woah! I didn't know linux could "shred"
<Joufflu>	nice
<Onionnion>	email | md5sum > final
<toothe>	and I rely on duckduckgo to index it.
*	Onionnion sees himself out
<toothe>	err...google...
<toothe>	tubaman: I plan to put my PGP public key and then encrypt every email in storage.
<tubaman>	what are you using for an MDA?
<tubaman>	exim?  procmail?
<toothe>	if I Understand the terminology, dovecot.
<tubaman>	as far as I know, dovecot is your imap/pop server right?
<toothe>	sorry, I get these things mixed up. Postfix.
<tubaman>	ah... ok... postfix
<toothe>	so, its the master.cf file.
<tubaman>	I use exim but the principle is the same
<toothe>	difference?
<toothe>	well, i guess its immaterial.
<tubaman>	Get postfix to call procmail as the MDA... have procmail encrypt the email
<toothe>	hm...
<tubaman>	https://www.j3e.de/pgp-mime-encrypt-in-procmail.html
<tubaman>	you can set the "mailbox_command" option in the postfix config file
<tubaman>	http://wiki.kartbuilding.net/index.php/Procmail_-_setup_with_postfix
<Slayerduck>	I'm getting general protection faults, bad swap file entry, bad page maps, trivial-rewrite segfaults and a whole other bunch of kernel panics every hour or so. I assumed it was ram but i can't get it to error on a memtest. What do ?
<toothe>	my understanding was that procmail sorted email.
<tubaman>	toothe: it can do a *bunch* of stuff
<JohnTalent>	what are some good unix books for pipes, overall and nonchanging parts of linux/unix?
<tubaman>	JohnTalent: Art of UNIX Programming
<tubaman>	http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/
<JohnTalent>	tubaman: thank you sir!
<toothe>	tubaman: so, just to be clear.
<toothe>	This will encrypt everything upon recipient?
<toothe>	specifially, the mail body
<toothe>	the data
<tubaman>	toothe: looks like it to me (caveat: I've never tried that particular procmail recipe but I know it can be done)
<tubaman>	after setting it up you could send some test messages to yourself to make sure
<toothe>	yeah, spamassassin has that string that automatically marks the email as spam.
<tubaman>	I use procmail to run spamassassin on my incoming email (rather than letting postfix/exim do it)
<JohnTalent>	tubaman: and how about dead trees?
<tubaman>	JohnTalent: well you can buy a dead tree copy of TAOUP.  I just picked up everything else by playing around.  I don't have any other suggestions.  Maybe someone else does?
<Remram>	btrfs can supposedly grow without unmounting, but can I grow a btrfs partition to the left?
<Remram>	(not a political statement)
<[R]>	nothing can grow to the left
<[R]>	thats just absurd
<[R]>	and lots of sane filesystems can expand lie
<[R]>	live*
<justanotheruser>	Is youtubes html5 player broken for anyone else?
<justanotheruser>	suddenly it only works for flash (and it looks different like they just had anupdate)
<tubaman>	justanotheruser: worked for me this morning
<jedevc>	justanotheruser: it's working fine for me in firefox without flash.

<pingfloyd>	justanotheruser: check with a current version of firefox
<toothe>	is there a way to create a user that can ONLY create an ssh-tunnel?
<toothe>	for example, i want to allow someone to use my box to ssh and create a tunnel
<toothe>	but
<toothe>	beyond that, I don't want the user to be able to do anything.
<pingfloyd>	Good luck.
<pingfloyd>	The whole point of ssh is secure remote shell access
<JohnTalent>	tubaman: thanks man.
<toothe>	right...
<toothe>	pingfloyd: but, you can kill the terminal, but still have a tunnel open.
<toothe>	kill bash, but have ssh running, if you will...
<JohnTalent>	tubaman: i was actually contemplating buying Unix Sys V book out of shear boredom and some intrigue.
<toothe>	out of boredom?
<JohnTalent>	toothe: yeah, As you may well imagine Sys V isn't exactly priority.
<pingfloyd>	You must have a lot of free time on your hands
<toothe>	yeah, i was thinking the same thing.
<toothe>	System V is very very old.
<pingfloyd>	To bother with sysv
<pingfloyd>	Now bsd, would be worthwhile
<JohnTalent>	pingfloyd: resume goes out, nothing comes back.
<toothe>	im trying to make a linux account whose only ability is to create a tunnel and NOTHING else.
<toothe>	having a bit of trouble setting that up.
<JohnTalent>	pingfloyd: noted.
<jaegerbomb>	Hello World!
<pingflood>	JohnTalent: for career and experience on resume, it is best to focus learning on what software is most pervasive for the location you want to work.
<JohnTalent>	tubaman: there is some good dead trees refs in your link!
<JohnTalent>	pingflood: no jobs near me.
<Loshki>	toothe: it's difficult to make such accounts secure. I think the best solution is a custom binary which runs on login.
<toothe>	yeha, i think that's what I'm going to do.
<Loshki>	toothe: there used to be rsh (restricted shell, not remote shell). Not seen it in a long time...
<daspence>	 what are the correct file permissions for rpm-gpg key?
<[R]>	644 sounds decent
<daspence>	would I ever need to use 1777?
<[R]>	well seeing as it's not an executable...
<daspence>	I ask about 1777 because I have some bash scripts that I have set to this permission
<[R]>	nor can i think of a rason it would need the sticky bit
<jaegerbomb>	test
<diegoviola>	644 is read-write for user, read/read for group/others
<[R]>	daspence: and rpm-gpg key has nothing to do with bash scripts
<daspence>	indeed it does not.
*	sysrage is now known as systest
*	systest is now known as sysrage
<daspence>	the only reason why i'm asking is because yum install or update anything returns Errno -1 repomd.xml does not match metalink for updates, trying other mirror [R]
<[R]>	daspence: and so naturally you assumed the permissions on the gpg key were wrong?
<[R]>	daspence: thats a bug in fedora, they are fixing it
<[R]>	someone in #fedora has a workaround if you can't wait
<[R]>	(where you should have gone in the first place)
<daspence>	alright, thank you for your insight [R]...indeed I should have.
<CharlesIC>	#vbox is completely dead. i used disk2vhd to make an image of a windows 8.1 installation, but in linux virtualbox, when i try to boot it, it says medium not found
<reisio>	try large
<CharlesIC>	huh?
<reisio>	IME, using Microsoft tools for things is folly
<reisio>	use https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Migrate_Windows like I told you to already
<reisio>	and then it'll work
<reisio>	see how that works? You follow instructions... and then things work
<CharlesIC>	reisio, you clown, i have been following instructions
<CharlesIC>	the ones i've received from #vbox
<CharlesIC>	apparently they went to bed
<CharlesIC>	the guy in there, drj, said he's done it at least 10 times
<reisio>	some people do that
<reisio>	yeah? I heard this guy once, he said he could eat 50 eggs
<reisio>	so I believed him
<reisio>	now we can be in the nonsense club together
<CharlesIC>	well, this has been useful
<reisio>	2/2
<jpleau>	from the disk2vhd site, they say this tool creates images for virtual-pc and hyper-v
*	reisio does imaginary dance
<jpleau>	i dont see virtualbox in that list
<reisio>	he just wants some nonsense microsoft tool to magically work without going through the explicit steps on vbox.org
<jpleau>	I know people like that :)
<jpleau>	"Linux is crap, this tool I run on windows that is made for windows backups won't restore our Linux backups" - wat
<socomm>	Couldn't you use clonezilla to do the same thing?
<reisio>	socomm: sup
<reisio>	y'know what I heard?
<reisio>	heard you can use this: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Migrate_Windows
<SoItBegins>	I can confirm Disk2VHD works in making VBox-compatible images.
<reisio>	BAAAZZZIIINNGGGAAA
<reisio>	moreover: who cares about your win32 nonsense! :D
<diegoviola>	win32? is that still a thing?
<diegoviola>	I thought it was only used in wine at this point?L
<socomm>	Rumor has it windows 10 is the last windows.
<SoItBegins>	Not a rumor.
<socomm>	Microsoft is going to start pushing "Windows as a service"
<reisio>	semantics
<diegoviola>	socomm: I doubt that
<socomm>	diegoviola: Man of little faith.
<SoItBegins>	I'd like to point out that OS X has remained OS X for a decade now.
<diegoviola>	socomm: weren't they talking about making windows "open source"?
<socomm>	tisk tisk tisk
<SoItBegins>	I get the feeling it'll never not be X, barring some massive paradigm shift.
<socomm>	diegoviola: Windows is dead, my man. The cloud is the future.
<toothe>	socomm: hmm...disagree...
<SoItBegins>	socomm: https://xkcd.com/908/ no it's not.
<socomm>	To be fair though they've tried the same with office and that hasn't exactly taken off.
<socomm>	So ....
<toothe>	i think there is an assault on the OS
<toothe>	but, i don't know that I agre.
<diegoviola>	socomm: well, I'm not of little faith, at this point I can totally see Microsoft doing anything stupid, it's not like it will be the first time
<reisio>	remained os x? As opposed to what?
<SoItBegins>	Well, before that there was System 7, 8, 9.
<socomm>	Wait, so anyone taking bets.
<socomm>	Which dies first windows or NetBSD?
<SoItBegins>	But I will bet you won't be seeing a Mac OS XI / 11 any time soon.
<toothe>	what /etc/init.d will execute after the network connectivity is established?
<reisio>	socomm: Windows
<socomm>	reisio: OS XI
<michaelrose>	diegoviola, regarding open source windows, said no one ever
<reisio>	however, sadly the only thing they have to do to keep Windows alive (in some form, at least), is open source it when they give up
<socomm>	SoItBegins: Give it time. Apple will run out of innovations soon enough.
<socomm>	"One more thing, we are introducing Mac OS XI..."
<SoItBegins>	socomm: You'd think that would apply to Microsoft too.
<michaelrose>	socomm, and then they will only have their 100 billion dollars to keep them warm..
<SoItBegins>	And they haven't run out of innovations yet either… questionable though Microsoft's are.
<socomm>	michaelrose: Not enough to keep the investors happy.
<michaelrose>	I'm sure they can BUY somebody innovative for that if they don't waste it on stuff like trying to tesla
<socomm>	michaelrose: iCar.
<socomm>	They already have iOS for automobiles.
*	Z_ is now known as Guest6172
<SoItBegins>	I heard they're supposedly releasing a game console, though I don't believe it.
<socomm>	They've been releasing a console since the 90s.
<socomm>	But video games are pretty much dead now.
<SoItBegins>	Like I said, I don't believe that one.
<SoItBegins>	"video games are pretty much dead now."
<michaelrose>	in what universe are video games dead
<SoItBegins>	WAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA what are you smoking?
<socomm>	Name one good tripple A tittle released in the last 12 months.
<SoItBegins>	Sunset Overdrive.
<SoItBegins>	Pokémon OmegaRuby and AlphaSapphire.
<SoItBegins>	Also, triple-A games ≠ 'video games'. They're only a subset.
<reisio>	they kinda are dead, as far as entertainment value goes :p
<SoItBegins>	reisio: ...what
<SoItBegins>	I dunno about you, but I was enjoying myself on my 3DS just earlier today.
<michaelrose>	it is an utterly awesome time to be an indy dev, you can get a machine suitable to use for a few hundreds of dollars, multiple pro quality engines for the choosing with nothing to pay until you sell and only a reasonable portion of the take required then, a distribution platform that doesn't rely on competing with eg games for shelf space at walmart
<socomm>	3DS? I haven't been 12 well for more than 22 years.
<SoItBegins>	socomm: I'm 24.
<socomm>	Licensing engines?! How un-macho.
<SoItBegins>	I don't understand that remark.
<socomm>	SoItBegins: a 'real' programmer would write their own engine.
<SoItBegins>	socomm: I invite you to try it and see how far you get. Many 'real' programmers care about getting their game out the door slightly more than its composition.
<reisio>	SoItBegins: I was enjoying myself on your 3ds, too
<SoItBegins>	Consider: How many 3D games used the old Unreal engine and variants?
<reisio>	...playing pacman
<SoItBegins>	reisio: I'm not sure if that's supposed to be an innuendo or something, but… OK.
<SoItBegins>	reisio: Oh. Pacman? :D
<michaelrose>	realisticly a game engine would allow a reasonable size group of people to make something great, I assume you were being sarcastic socomm
<socomm>	michaelrose: somewhat, but not altogether
<reisio>	realistically a game engine is written in C++ and only allows mediocrity :D
<SoItBegins>	XP
<socomm>	There's something to be said for writting your own engine.
<SoItBegins>	That is true. Unity is a bit… bulky.
<reisio>	big classed*
<socomm>	But I guess its the world we live in. People don't want to bother setting up their own computer clusters, or writting their own libraries.
<reisio>	or learning a language worth learning
<SoItBegins>	like Python! :D
<socomm>	jsquery and aws for the younguns
<SoItBegins>	Also, hang on, how'd we get from writing engines to writing libraries?
*	socomm crawls back into his cave
<sauvin>	Perl.
<socomm>	sauvin: ewwww
<socomm>	Thats one language I couldn't really get into.
<dfzxh>	anyone here ever dream about escaping to a deserted island with nothing but a hatchet and a copy of the unix programmer's manual?
<reisio>	perl's okay
<reisio>	#perl's kind of clowny
<dfzxh>	spend your days designing your own unix system
<dfzxh>	implementing the file system
<socomm>	dfzxh: Sounds great, but what are you gonna do with that manual?
<reisio>	dfzxh: s/programmer.*/your hot seester/ ftfm
<socomm>	No electricity. No computers. No toilet paper.
<dfzxh>	build a computer out of sticks and leaves
<reisio>	unlimited poop
<socomm>	I guess we just found a use for that manual after all.
<SoItBegins>	XD oh dear...
<reisio>	ironically the same use it's always had
<dfzxh>	the #1 thing to do in a wilderness survival situation is to decide on an instruction set architecture for your cpu so you can calculate the optimal square footage before night fall
<booboy>	legend
<LMNOP__>	yep and then you must program the boot sector in hex
<reisio>	the number one thing to do is smack whomever suggests agriculture
<recognosco>	agriculture is the backbone of human civilization
<reisio>	exactly, it causes the most awful thing there is
<socomm>	So my programming sucks. So I'm going to go back and re-learn my maths.
<reisio>	:D
<reisio>	socomm: nice
<socomm>	I liking this khan acadamy thing.
<recognosco>	socomm: read Concrete Math if you had to read two books
<socomm>	Man kids these days don't know how good they ahve it. You can practically learn anything on the internet - no matter how poor you are.
<recognosco>	(By Donald Knuth)
<socomm>	recognosco: Do I need math background for this?
<recognosco>	socomm: quite a bit. even though knuth says high school algebra is enough. i don't trust that guy.
<recognosco>	socomm: or my highschool really sucked and i never thought about it.
<reisio>	socomm: Benedict Cumberbatch should pimp it
*	Sir_Leto2 is now known as Sir_Leto
<Loshki>	socomm: not all programming needs math. At one time, language majors were heavily recruited to become programmers.
<recognosco>	socomm: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics
<socomm>	Loshki: Probably not for basic tasks, but for more advanced stuff math helps quite a bit.
<reisio>	Loshki: what time was that?
<reisio>	IME language majors can add numbers together
<socomm>	recognosco: Thanks, I'll add it to the books I'd love to read but probably won't have time to. :^)
<Loshki>	reisio: early days of programming in the UK. 60s and 70s...
<diegoviola>	I doubt windows will die anytime soon, they still have a huge marketshare.  there's no question that Microsoft has been running like headless chicken due to Android dominating on mobile though
<reisio>	probably 'cause all the people who knew maths were dying in Palestine by then
<reisio>	weeeee UK!
<reisio>	"soon" in technology years
<recognosco>	socomm: it's difficult to find time to read textbooks out of class. if you do though, i'd highly recommend it. especially if you are interested in the mathematics of computer science.

<reisio>	it's difficult to read text books... without text, otherwise it's normal
<socomm>	diegoviola: It was a joke. I've heard of some government agencies who still run legacy code in windows NT for some of their core services.
<Loshki>	Also, plan to keep on reading technical books for the rest of your (working) life, to keep your brain (and career) expanding.
<reisio>	because government agencies set the bar? :p
*	reisio giggles
*	robink_ is now known as robink
<socomm>	reisio: Well, government and banks are usually some of the slower moving sectors out there. In terms of upgrading their technology.
<reisio>	yeah, so what's the point in mentioning it
<diegoviola>	socomm: I always see lots of shops running Windows XP still
<socomm>	diegoviola: There really isn't anything wrong with windows xp.
<diegoviola>	except that it's not receiving updates anymore
<socomm>	I can't remember but aren't some customers still receiving updates for XP?
<reisio>	sure
<reisio>	Windows updates aren't worth much anyway :p
<reisio>	"boom, 4-year-old CVE patch landed, aren't you glad you use Microsoft Windows? :)"
<socomm>	Not as much as Apple updates at least.
<reisio>	updates are irrelevant on Mac OS
<reisio>	mac people actually look forward to them as a new opportunity to overpay for something
<socomm>	why
<reisio>	because: insanity
<socomm>	I'll never understand why start-ups flock to apple hardware.
<ronkrt>	Is there away to find out if a hdd isn't working because it's bad drive or connector?
<socomm>	I mean it goes against everything that running lean stands for.
<reisio>	running lean is one approach
<reisio>	selling richness is another
<SoItBegins>	The thing with Mac is that they deliver quality and it's relatively hassle-free (minimal configuration compared to Windows, or indeed Linux). Apple did put a lot of thought and design into their computers.
<reisio>	most business is about selling things, and not about selling good things
<reisio>	SoItBegins: sounded like you're confusing software and hardware a bit
<recognosco>	apple hardware can be pretty slick looking and surprisingly of pretty good build quality
<socomm>	Maybe I'm the wrong person to sayd this, but Linux and Windows are probably as hassle-free as Apple stuff.
<reisio>	a macbook air _is_ hassle free, because you can't do a thing with it
<SoItBegins>	socomm: wahahahaha I've wrangled with Windows 7 a lot more than I ever have with Mac.
<[R]>	reisio: haha
<reisio>	exactly as mac users like it
<SoItBegins>	reisio: Which things did you want to do with it? #curious
<[R]>	reisio: this guy at my work loves his
<socomm>	Mac requires me to relearn the way I do things. Why would I want apple stuff?
<reisio>	I'm sure there's already a comic of a mac user, in a cardigan (of course), looking at a two-button mouse and saying "What the fsck is this bourgeois concession?!"
<[R]>	reisio: bourgeois?
<SoItBegins>	….
<recognosco>	socomm: OSX is Unix under the hood. don't relearn anything if you don't want to.
<reisio>	[R]: I could probably tolerate one, but not because the hardware is at all adjustable
<SoItBegins>	You… realize that Apple has already released a two-button mouse?
<socomm>	recognosco: I know whats under the hood, I'm talking about their user interface
<reisio>	[R]: something for poor people
<reisio>	SoItBegins: because you've said that, I'm going to have to make even more fun of you :p
<socomm>	Didn't apple just release laptop with only one USB port?
<SoItBegins>	Yep, they did.
<SoItBegins>	I do think they kinda missed a bet on that one.
<reisio>	probably 3 other proprietary ports, though
<socomm>	I like how apple removes stuff and calls it 'innovation'
<recognosco>	yeah. lol. that is hilarious though.
<socomm>	No more floppies. No more CD-ROMs. No more USB ports.
<reisio>	hey, you can innovate in the realm of mediocrity
<SoItBegins>	No, literally a single USB-C port. The new Macbook Air has no other ports. None. Whatsoever.
<SoItBegins>	You even charge over USB. (wtf?)
<socomm>	I can't wait for the no more Ethernet Cards.
<reisio>	people will pay a fortune for it
<reisio>	because: insanity
<socomm>	Those new laptops do have ethernet cards, right?
<[R]>	socomm: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHZ8ek-6ccc
*	reisio needs brushed metal in his brushed metal
<recognosco>	socomm: simplicity is great design though. less is more. i would love to NOT be able to have wires or ports. everything whould be wireless.
<reisio>	simplicity isn't a design, it's a word
<reisio>	everything should be free and covered with naked women, too
<reisio>	it's a ways off
<SoItBegins>	. . . what about naked men? #gender equality
<kraut360>	too much simplicity is mediocrity
<socomm>	[R]: Thats funnier if you don't speak spanish.
<reisio>	SoItBegins: think you mean sex #knowingwordsproperly
<[R]>	socomm: yeah, i have no clue what hes saying
<bullgard4>	[Debian-8 Emergency mode] '#journalctl -xb' reports a line: "<timestamp> <hostname> systemd-udevd [146] worker [166] /devices/platform/thinkpad_acpi/sound/card29/controlC29 timeout; kill it" <-- What does here mean "worker"?
<SoItBegins>	reisio: This is a can of worms perpendicular to our current argument.
<socomm>	OH NO DEBIAN EMERGENCY!!
<socomm>	bullgard4: /j #debian
<reisio>	cans of worms are perpendicular to all things
<socomm>	reisio: Mu.
<bullgard4>	socomm: I won't.
<socomm>	bullgard4: Okay.
<Loshki>	bullgard4: guessing worker refers to a thread...
<SoItBegins>	socomm: proof that cows are algorithmic savants: when asked about any question, they always reply with the ancient name for NULL.
<recognosco>	reisio: i'd still love a star trek world. no wires.
<reisio>	what wires do you have?
<socomm>	Wait that new laptop has a netbook processor?
<bullgard4>	Loshki: The term "thread" has several meanings. What thread do you think of?
<reisio>	we need omega-13 to wirelessly charge things first
<recognosco>	reisio: USB. power. hdmi. dvi. ethernet.
<reisio>	discuss
<reisio>	usb-c: look ma, still not radially symmetrical
<Loshki>	bullgard4: I was deliberately vague, since I haven't looked at the code, but "worker" suggests one of a pool of resources allocated (and deallocated) as needed. It's just a (educated) guess.
<recognosco>	usb-c is still better than having apple's own magsafe and lightning bolt thing
<socomm>	Wait so whats the difference betwen regular USB and USB-c
<socomm>	Yes, I'm lazy.
<[R]>	socomm: its reversible
<SoItBegins>	Remember USB 2.0? This is 3.0 or 4.0 or whatever
<SoItBegins>	#I'm pretty  sure
<Loshki>	[R]: reversible? Do you mean backwards compatible?
<recognosco>	The USB-C connector in the MacBook supports DisplayPort, HDMI, power, USB, and VGA.
<socomm>	Loshki: I think he means no up or down orientation.
<recognosco>	so one port could do all that
<[R]>	Loshki: you can plug it in either way
<Loshki>	We used to call that bisexual.
<SoItBegins>	: P
<[R]>	recognosco: one port to rule them all
<socomm>	Wait so if you mess up that one port ....
<socomm>	ohohoho
<[R]>	socomm: and its how your charge it...
<recognosco>	should totally post on reddit and create a hype about USB wireless and say it's USB-W that is USB-C but wireless.
<socomm>	Isn't reddit like 4chan/something awful, but for 'normal' people?
<recognosco>	the question is, what is normal?
<socomm>	10Gb transfer.
<socomm>	That's pretty good.
<bullgard4>	Loshki: Thank you.
<pr0tlogic>	I have a NetGear, Inc. WNA3100(v1) Wireless-N 300 [Broadcom BCM43231] and am trying to install it on CentOS 7, the kernel I am using is 3.10.0-229.1.2.el7.x86_64 is there a way I can install ndiswrapper from yum? I tried using the elrepo, but I didn't see ndiswrapper there, or is there a native module I can use?
<socomm>	pr0tlogic: There is a #centos channel on this network.
<pr0tlogic>	socomm: Yeah, but it's a Linux question.
<dfzxh>	anybody here just hang out in the linux console all day
<dfzxh>	dont even bother starting x
<socomm>	dfzxh: I just ssh onto my linux boxes.
<bullgard4>	pr0tlogic: socomm keeps telling other people that there are other cannels.
<dfzxh>	sipping on a flat warm beer, havent showered in 3 days
<bullgard4>	+h
<pr0tlogic>	bullgard4, it would be better if he could actually answer a question instead.
<Remram>	Can I allow one specific user to use the Xwrapper?
<[R]>	Remram: what is "the xwrapper"?
<pr0tlogic>	Remram, yes you can, in the config just do allowed_users=user1,user2,user3
<Remram>	pr0tlogic: nah doesn't work, it only seem to accept "rootonly", "console" or "anybody"
<Remram>	"anybody" is really insecure
<socomm>	I still don't know what xwrapper is.
<pr0tlogic>	ahh, didn't know that Remram.
<Remram>	it's really annoying... I guess I can hack something with sudo
<socomm>	Remram: set it to 'rootonly' and then have the user sudo to run the command.
<socomm>	Remram: You could enven limit the user to just that one command through the sudo config.

<MonkehParade>	I have 20gb unallocated space put aside to extend the root partition.
<MonkehParade>	.. and I have already cloned the partition (via clonezilla) incase anything happens.

<dfzxh>	MonkehParade: int *ptr;

<smileybone>	and not overwrite anything critical
<bullgard4>	http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/journal-files/: "The systemd journal stores log data in a binary format with several features: i.) Fully indexed by all fields, ii.) …" What does "indexed by" mean here?
<smileybone>	and when you install in future just take the entire disk, so much easier than dealing w/ bootloaders
<MonkehParade>	I share my hard-disk with windows :c
<MonkehParade>	.. so I can't really allocate the whole harddisk :c
<MonkehParade>	.. as much as I'd love to.
<smileybone>	oof, does windows even play nice?
<SoItBegins>	I don't think it's :c as much as C:, or perhaps D:.
<smileybone>	on my workstation I dual boot freebsd and windows 8 (for vidya games), and windows 8 wont even boot if the freebsd SSD is even connected
<smileybone>	i haven't bothered to troubleshoot
<MonkehParade>	Kind of, but linux does screw around with the windows partition, making me have to run chkdsk every now and then.
<smileybone>	hmmm
<smileybone>	so the windows partition is on it now?
<MonkehParade>	(i've set the windows partition to auto-mount in linux)
<MonkehParade>	It's one hard-disk and multiple partitions.
<smileybone>	hmm... I'd check w/ somebody w/ more experience w/ filesystems + firmware
<smileybone>	cuz its possible the partitions aren't exactly contiguous
<MonkehParade>	Thanks for your help though c:
<smileybone>	yea dude, np. Its sort of an edge case, and I gave up dealing with resizing multiple partitions on the same physical device years ago. it can get to be a headache

<tona>	i am using centos 6.6 but it doesnt detect any usb port nor pen drive, could someone guide me please
<tona>	i tried insmod -i usb_storage
<neonrooster>	tona: did you try lsusb to see if Linux is detecting your USB hubs?
<neonrooster>	there's this thing called a root hub and if its not finding it your screwed and need a newer Linux kernel
<tona>	yes i tried it, but doesnt detect anything
<tona>	even i used dmesg
<neonrooster>	tona: would you please pastebin lsusb to me?
<tona>	ok
<tona>	Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
<tona>	this is the output
<neonrooster>	see my problem was not finding a root hub and then I had no USB
<neonrooster>	tona: then you need a newer Linux, same as my problem]
<neonrooster>	I had this problem too
<tona>	i have upgrade the kernel
<neonrooster>	tona: go upgrade it to Linux 4.x
<neonrooster>	or latest 3.x
<tona>	dso you knows how
<neonrooster>	tona: "make defconfig" then make menuconfig
<neonrooster>	enable drivers for your wifi, ethernet, ahci sata and filesystems
<neonrooster>	then KVM
<tona>	just typed this commadn in the shell
<tona>	could you be clear , i am new with linux
<neonrooster>	erm um...ask the rest of this channel/chatroom how to make it easier
<neonrooster>	but basically you do this: go to http://kernel.org
<neonrooster>	then you click on latest stable kernel, and then you extract the Linux kernel: tar -xvf Downloads/linux-4.0.2.tar.xz
<tona>	ok download the kernel and execute the commadn above right
<neonrooster>	yes
<tona>	ok
<tona>	let start thanks

<tona>	ok

<tona>	ok
<DLange>	tona: read through https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Migration_Planning_Guide/chap-Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux-Migration_Planning_Guide-Upgrading.html and follow that
<tona>	ok
<tona>	thanks man
<DLange>	no prob. Just make sure you substitite the CentOS info in place of the RHEL info.
<DLange>	The CentOS guys have not yet made the docs available as "theirs" (and since they are now Red Hat as well may be never will)
<maarhart>	could you help me with this i915 issue? dmesg: http://paste.debian.net/174261
<tona>	Dlange one question more, neonrooster told me , download the last kernel, i tried to unpack and make deconfig and make ***, which is the diffenece about  make ... and make install
<DLange>	tona: "make" produced the result (in this case a kernel) and "make install" installs it into the file system hierarchy (/boot, /usr etc.)
<tona>	what about make deconfig  and make menuconfig
<tona>	Dlange
<DLange>	but I'd not manually compile kernels for "binary" distributions. That's not a beginner-level undertaking and may get you frustrated (and render your system unusable)

<totesmuhgoats>	the bios seems to indicate that the cpu is running at 3.2ghz
<totesmuhgoats>	is something wrong here, or is lscpu just reporting incorrectly

<K1773R>	totesmuhgoats: https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cpu-freq/
<totesmuhgoats>	K1773R: are you telling me that the OS is caling the cpu frequency down because it doesn't need more than 800mhz at the time when i ran the command?

<ahc>	ayecee: shoudn't it be like /usr/lib/libattr.so.1? As long as it works then it's fine.
<ERBSE>	ahc:  is libattr.so.1 a symbol link to ../lib/libattr.so.1?
<ayecee>	ahc: it works, yse
<ayecee>	yes
<ahc>	ERBSE: I don't know, when I ldd gnome-shell, the linking shows like that.
<ERBSE>	i think it's because your ldd didn't convert the path for symbol link,
<ERBSE>	it work so it's not a problem
<ahc>	ERBSE: I see, I think it's gcc doing linking that way, but I may be wrong.
<ayecee>	ahc: nope, not gcc.
<hiro__>	hey
<ERBSE>	ahc: gnome-shell only known it need "libattr.so.1", then the system located it from /usr/lib, that's not the linking problem

<ERBSE>	ahc: .. you mean there a rpath in gnome-shell executable?
<ahc>	could be
<ahc>	gnome-session gives: Library rpath: [/usr/lib/../lib]
<ERBSE>	ahc: hmm.. then check the compiler flag from the source package of gnome
<ERBSE>	look is there a -rpath argument
<DLange>	dyllan: if you run a GUI on that server, sure
<dyllan>	DLange: yea, but its headless at the moment, would prefer to do it without installing a desktop etc.
<DLange>	dyllan: then ssh in and use mc (midnight commander). More than good enough to move a few files.

<ahc>	ERBSE: there is no -rpath in Makefile, only in Configure file. I compile many packages and /usr/lib/../lib is in almost every library.
<ERBSE>	ahc: rpath shouldn't use in most case, try to remove it and see is it work
<ERBSE>	also, you'are building a custom distro?

<ayecee>	welpo: because you wanted -s

<_user>	hello, how to read .tex file ?
<welpo>	Thanks
<welpo>	_user: It should be plain text, as far as I know
<welpo>	So... vim or your favourite text editor
<rumpel>	_user, with any editor you like. It's just plain text. Or do you ask how to compile it into a ps/pdf?
<welpo>	If you want to make it into a PDF, that's another thing
<_user>	hmm nope, text editor can be too
<_user>	thanks
<_user>	nope
<_user>	text editor dont show that propetly, i need to compile that to pdf
<_user>	then
<rumpel>	_user, depends. When there a a lot of complicated formulas, the .tex file itself is kind of hard to read.
<rumpel>	_user, where did you get the .tex file from?
<_user>	https://github.com/agrentum/haskell-course-pl
<_user>	text editor dont show it propetly, i need something else
<welpo>	Yeah, you need to compile them
<welpo>	What system are you on?
<_user>	arch
<welpo>	Looks like gedit and LaTeXila can both do that
<welpo>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/LaTeX
<_user>	okay thanks
<_user>	so i use that latex in my text editor also i see
<welpo>	np
<welpo>	Well the .tex files are plain text, they contain the markup language. If you want to see "the end result" you need to compile it
<welpo>	Similar to how html is plain text, but when you go to any website you don't see the source code
<_user>	yea i dont have the source code
<welpo>	In this case you are seeing the "source code" when you open the .tex by itself
<_user>	yes
<_user>	and u give me that latex link
<_user>	so i can use latex in emacs
<xeon-enouf>	e^0: which chipset? i think for intel_pstate you need the Nehalem (Sandy/Ivy bridge) or newer
<_user>	so i dont need to compile
<e^0>	xeon-enouf: it's Ivy bridge
<e^0>	the newest one
<welpo>	_user: are you asking that or stating it?
<_user>	what ??
<_user>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/LaTeX
<_user>	https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=auctex
<_user>	that should help me yes ? u give me that link
<xeon-enouf>	e^0: see preview.tinyurl.com/ol3uoex  ..and also you'll need atleast a certain kernel version
<xeon-enouf>	e^0: grep CONFIG_X86_INTEL_PSTATE /boot/config-$(uname -r)
<welpo>	_user: again. .tex files contain the plain text you saw when you used your text editor, kind of their source code, but in text. If you want to see how they'd look like in a PDF or whatever, you need to compile the TEX file
<_user>	omg
<_user>	so tell me dude
<_user>	why u give me that link about latex ?
<welpo>	Because I was showing the options you had to compile the tex file.
<xeon-enouf>	e^0: i bet, if it comes down to it, you could echo proper values into a /sys/ file, but.. perhaps you have older software pkgs installed, and/or daemons running, that are interfering with newer tech/software/daemons/settings
<_user>	latex dont compile text
<_user>	for me
<e^0>	xeon-enouf: getting this is output grep: /boot/config-3.19.3-3-ARCH: No such file or directory
<xeon-enouf>	e^0: and echo'ing into /sys/ isn't going to get you a fluctuating cpufreq, heh, where it idles down or speeds up as needed
<e^0>	xeon-enouf: i just now installed arch linux, like 15 days back.
<welpo>	_user: You need to understand what latex is. I've tried to explain it
<_user>	i dont need know what latex is
<xeon-enouf>	e^0: maybe arch has config in /proc/config.gz ?
<_user>	becouse i need to compile that text
<xeon-enouf>	e^0: so zgrep that
<_user>	but if i dont have sources
<e^0>	ok
<welpo>	The source is the .tex, _user
<_user>	that text is useless and garbage
<_user>	okay
<_user>	so how to compile that .tex
<_user>	okay i get it
<e^0>	xeon-enouf: still teh same output
<xeon-enouf>	e^0: search that tinyurl link for "CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL" and see what it mentions about it all
<xeon-enouf>	e^0: no such file or directory?
<xeon-enouf>	e^0: cat /proc/cmdline ; cat /proc/version
<xeon-enouf>	e^0: where's your config? ffs
<welpo>	_user: You clone the parts folder from the github you shared, you choose whatever editor/env you want from the wiki I linked, and then google how to compile with the tool you chose
<xeon-enouf>	zgrep PSTAT /proc/config.gz e^0 ?
<_user>	welpo - why google ? dont use thanks, i think another searching things are still exist

<_user>	nope bing not

<welpo>	I don't use Google myself, I was trying to make you understand I use "Google" for "search it in whatever search engine you prefer", because it's shorter.
<_user>	welpo i know what you mean
<welpo>	Good.
<_user>	but i dont like named any search enige with name of google
<welpo>	I guess you felt the need to let us all know how much you hate google.
<_user>	nope, i dont
<_user>	u need to let us me know

<SpikeMaster>	what distro is the best for recent packages? But at the same time safe to withhold updates for a year, but still work flawylessly when you finally decided to update.
<SpikeMaster>	ie not arch (which will break if you don't update often), but similar to arch none the less.
<super_mrwu>	gnome under xwayland is sluggish
<super_mrwu>	on wayland
<super_mrwu>	unresponsive
<pid1>	SpikeMaster, I'm not sure you could not update something for a year and expect it to work "flawlessly," but Debian Sid might be a decent option.
<SpikeMaster>	pid1. thanks maybe i'll try debian sid then. The thing is I may store my computer (tower) in the closet for a year. When i finally use it again i'd prefer for it to still work after updating.
<SpikeMaster>	Arch just can't provide that ability.  Not even for a few months.
<SpikeMaster>	the "guaranteed to not work" model just seems flawed to me.
<xeon-enouf>	triceratux: yea, not so here; no javashit allowed here, heh

<ytrezq>	Hello, does someone know a tiny single process DNS server http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/q/4394/2341 ?
<xeon-enouf>	SpikeMaster: debian testing with specific sid pinning is likely a better option -- but i'd give testing a few months after Stable release to flesh out the bugs, (and perhaps others have some of these features)
<xeon-enouf>	SpikeMaster: features = apt-listbugs and apt-listchanges
<xeon-enouf>	so prior to installing (as you run an install / upgrade command), you can review whether or not to install, it intervenes in between ; also get to know apt-get -s option
<xeon-enouf>	ytrezq: i have no idea what you're asking; and i see you paste teh same one line of text over and over again, with a URL, with no other context to your query; I'm not visiting the url you posted
<bizarrefish>	Hi all
<SpikeMaster>	ok. Debian will be my new linux distro. Think it is better able to handle machiens that are not frequently updated.
<ytrezq>	xeon-enouf:  Hello, does someone know a tiny single process DNS server optimized for RAM usage (embedded device with less than 15Mb available) http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/q/4394/2341 ?
<ytrezq>	xeon-enouf:  Hello, does someone know a tiny single process DNS server optimized for RAM usage (embedded device with less than 15Mb available) http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/q/4394/2341 ? It need to support NS records and zone transfers.
<MetaNova>	ytrezq: can you not spam?
<ytrezq>	sorry
<bizarrefish>	ytrezq: I take it dnsmasq doesn't do the required things
<Foxhoundz>	what about bind?
<Foxhoundz>	bind9
<MetaNova>	judging by their post, they've already dismissed bind, dnsmasq, and maradns for various reasons
<guampa>	bind can do mostly anything, but i don't thing it would count as a smallish server
<ytrezq>	bind9 has built-in support without modules for things like SSL TCP DNS mysql ldap and it does things like copying files in RAM… Lot of useless features and lot of designs features which make it RAM greedy
<rocketmagnet>	hi all, does someoken know how to Gettext documentation is written ???
<rocketmagnet>	or ny other doc system that generates .man also and so on
<xeon-enouf>	ytrezq: this may sound silly, even foolish, why not just use a /etc/hosts* file?
<ytrezq>	xeon-enouf: /etc/hosts doesn’t support zone transfers. This is for public internet DNS
<ytrezq>	and the parent server will do zone transfers over ipv6
<ytrezq>	from the child zone
<xeon-enouf>	oh
<ytrezq>	and I am running the child zone
<xeon-enouf>	why do i recall seeing someone, as a contest to write smallest possible program, using fewest lines of code; coded a DNS server? or was it DHCP
<pikaren>	what do u do when u paid for a porn site but later found out it used silverlight and is not linux friendly at all
<ytrezq>	xeon-enouf: a point which helps is that the system is 32 bits
<ytrezq>	not 64
<xeon-enouf>	refund, with physical amenities pikaren
<ytrezq>	the exact CPU name is BCM6358
<xeon-enouf>	ytrezq: so 15MB total system ram?
<ytrezq>	xeon-enouf: the kernel take 12MB
<stupid-1>	happy mothers day

<stupid-1>	ok
<xeon-enouf>	stupid-1: is it Mothers Day?
<stupid-1>	but i'm not a mother
<ytrezq>	xeon-enouf: Yes and I got this kind of answers "That question is only superficially mips-specific, you realize?"
<xeon-enouf>	stupid-1: so what
<xeon-enouf>	ytrezq: ok
<xeon-enouf>	ytrezq: how about you rent-a-coder and have one write one up for you :-P
<xeon-enouf>	or do it yourself
<stupid-1>	most of all the servers i login to are unix...unix is really big..and there tuff to hack
<xeon-enouf>	ytrezq: no way to attach external storage/ram/devices etc?
<xeon-enouf>	s/tuff/tough/  and what about all those unix mothers, don't hack them
<super_mrwu>	xeon-enouf: i am finding a way to remove the EFI stub of the kernel without recompiling the kernel.

<ytrezq>	xeon-enouf: coding it myself. Yes this is ultimately the thing I will do. But I don’t have the time for next week
<Lovich>	Will google that, thank you

<rascul>	the man page disagrees with you
<Lovich>	_KaszpiR_ thank you
<coderman1>	how would i recursively zip all files in a directory tree that match a wildcard?
<coderman1>	the issue im running into is the files have spaces in it
<coderman1>	so "find /home/clients -name *.processed | xargs gzip -9" is failing with stuff like RETURN: No such file or directory because the filename is FILE RETURN CN.processed
<annihilannic>	find -print0 and xargs -0
<annihilannic>	null-separates the filenames
<ytrezq>	rascul: Oh things changed
<coderman1>	ah thank you
<ytrezq>	rascul: but I don’t understand how I can use it.
<MetaNova>	coderman1: find /home/clients -name \*processed -priint0 | xargs -0 gzip -9
<MetaNova>	er, excuse me
<MetaNova>	coderman1: find /home/clients -name \*.processed -priint0 | xargs -0 gzip -9
<MetaNova>	there we go
<coderman1>	hehe 2 i's in print?
<MetaNova>	damnit

<momomo>	is that compiz?
<storge>	compiz is compiz, x is x
<xeon-enouf>	MrElendig: } both /proc/cpuinfo and lspcu (and | grep MHz) watched with a watch -n0 should surely show the freq changing, no?
<xeon-enouf>	aldarsior: try ##networking or a #bind channel
<momomo>	storge, what could be the issue here/
<momomo>	?
<xeon-enouf>	momomo: nice/renice it, if it's bothersome
<xeon-enouf>	momomo: likely some other stupid fat GUI app is sucking your cpu blood
<xeon-enouf>	momomo: what does htop say; sort by CPU usage
<cedra>	i tried elementary and gnome but neither work in my vmware i think it's broken
<cedra>	so i'm getting neither
<cedra>	RIP
<xeon-enouf>	cedra: try vbox
<momomo>	could it be htop?
<xeon-enouf>	vmware = vmwarez
<cedra>	lol
<xeon-enouf>	momomo: could what be htop?
<momomo>	the hog
<storge>	no
<xeon-enouf>	doubtful
<xeon-enouf>	so no
<xeon-enouf>	sort the shit man; use the Fn keys as it shows you
<xeon-enouf>	cedra: or use KVM/Qemu
<xeon-enouf>	lucido: screen is a gnu app
<cedra>	i don't want to get another one
<cedra>	everytime I try to start things
<cedra>	it just says, internal flaw or something
<xeon-enouf>	gnu.org/software/screen
<xeon-enouf>	or so
<storge>	then enjoy the brokenness
<cedra>	i think i'm setting them up wrong
<xeon-enouf>	perhaps you're internally flawed :-P
<xeon-enouf>	lucido: OH...
<storge>	i know i am
<storge>	today it took me 2 hours to boot up
<xeon-enouf>	lucido: my bad
<storge>	i woke up at 8am and got out of bed at 10am
<xeon-enouf>	lucido: all i recall, is that i d/l the libXext* sources and found the DPMS.c in there; but also the xorg-docs src and ... /protocol/xextproto-7.xxxx src too, before i realized to use -iname with find to locate the CAPITALIZED DPMS.c filename. heh
<xeon-enouf>	lucido: see gnu.org, and locate idutils ; it _might_ help you on your endeavor ... nothing from #xorg-devel yet? Also ..shame using ubuntu; as #debian-xstrikeforce (or similar channel on OFTC.net might be able to help)
<xeon-enouf>	might be just #debian-x   IIRC
<xeon-enouf>	but don't bother them with ubuntu issues, heh... and sigh
<xeon-enouf>	storge: as long as frolicking in the sack occured, followed up with a smoke, and then breakfast in bed; it's all good :-)
<lucido>	xeon-enouf, xorg-dev is silent
<xeon-enouf>	lucido: ok ... sigh.. i'm still hoping someone can help me get DPMS working on Console
<storge>	xeon-enouf: none of those occurred. i did read twitter though.
<lucido>	xeon-enouf, I'll post my solution when I have it
<xeon-enouf>	lucido: cool
<xeon-enouf>	storge: shame, i'll pray for you
<}>	xeon-enouf, I think lscpu should work, but MrElendig says it wont
*	} is no expert
<xeon-enouf>	}: both will work
<xeon-enouf>	especially /proc/ files, which are live
<xeon-enouf>	and lscpu must get it's info from somewhere in there, or sys/ ; another live FS
<xeon-enouf>	pseudo/RAM VFS, nonetheless
<}>	xeon-enouf, Do I need hdparm -C to report the drive is in "standby" mode or "sleeping" ?
<DND>	hi guys i need help with exim
<xeon-enouf>	although, blkid will parse /etc/blkid.tab unless told not to... but not sure what lsblk, nor lscpu do
<}>	I'm not really sure what is optimal
<DND>	i wanted the soft bounce to be on another server for retry
<DND>	how can i do that?
<xeon-enouf>	}: report? man page says it checks/probes
<xeon-enouf>	DND: no idea; try /usr/share/doc/exim4*/*
<dfzxh>	lets say i have a linux console open on tty1 and x server running on tty2. how do i start an x application in tty1 and have it display on the x server in tty2?
<}>	right, I just want to know if the "sleeping" or "standby" state is preferred for my use case?
<xeon-enouf>	oh
<}>	dfzxh, you need to set DISPLAY
<}>	I believe
<}>	dfzxh, echo $DISPLAY
<xeon-enouf>	sleeping is lowest power mode; standby, while still spun down is slightly more
<DND>	xeon-enouf: i got to the #exim group. didnt know that existed lol. thanks for responding :)
<}>	dfzxh, DISPLAY=:0 xmessage "it works"
<}>	dfzxh, that works for me
<xeon-enouf>	DND: cool!
<dfzxh>	display is not set
<dfzxh>	i will set it, one sec
<}>	dfzxh, no
<}>	dfzxh, it must be set automatically
<xeon-enouf>	DISPLAY=:0.0
<}>	dfzxh, if its not set you did something wrong
<xeon-enouf>	oh
<dfzxh>	oh
<dfzxh>	do i need to relogin?
<}>	dfzxh, did you run echo $DISPLAY in X ?
<dfzxh>	no
<dfzxh>	i ran it in the linux console
<}>	you must do it in X
<}>	then use that value in the console, like DISPLAY=:0 xmessage "it works"
<}>	:0 is what you saw in X
<dfzxh>	oh okay
<xeon-enouf>	you nneed to redirect...
<dfzxh>	it is :0 in X
<dfzxh>	thank you
<}>	ok
<dfzxh>	hah
<dfzxh>	fantastic
<}>	ok
<dfzxh>	thanks guys
*	xeon-enouf shakes his can at all 'x* --help' ; complains about no X server running, heh
<rascul>	yeah
<xeon-enouf>	dfzxh: the :0 is the xserver. the .0 is the screen/monitor (though that's not entirely technically accurate)
<rascul>	that's because --help isn't a recognized option
<rascul>	-help ;)
<}>	xeon-enouf, I get $DISPLAY=:0 even with 2 monitors (X automatically sets it)
<xeon-enouf>	why not? GNU long options should apply, sigh
<xeon-enouf>	yea.. well...
<rascul>	x.org isn't gnu!
<xeon-enouf>	}: um, the :0 is the server, do i need to restate?
<}>	rascul, there's a fortune quote about that
<xeon-enouf>	rascul: right...
<rascul>	heh fortune
<rascul>	haven't seen that in years
<xeon-enouf>	DEC mangles DPMS it seems
<andrew39>	does nvidia support wayland

<xeon-enouf>	rascul: heck, xset q  (look ma, no hyphens!)
<}>	xeon-enouf, isnt that bsd style
<xeon-enouf>	andrew39: does wayland support nvidia?
<rascul>	ahh yeah, i vaguely recall seeing that one
<xeon-enouf>	}: no idea, you tell me bsdbeardo
<}>	:|
<andrew39>	xeon-enouf, does wayland support nvidia?
<xeon-enouf>	but i love using tar, ps, etc withOUT having to use -
<rascul>	xeon-enouf xset takes -, +, or no prefix options heh
<xeon-enouf>	rascul: wut?
<xeon-enouf>	no prefix = preferred
<rascul>	xset +dpms;xset -version, xset q
<xeon-enouf>	yea, screw that wonky nonsensical bit
<rascul>	ps options are different, btw
<rascul>	'ps -a' is not the same as 'ps a'
<xeon-enouf>	i mean, i understand the need for a + or - to set/unset
<xeon-enouf>	just like bash's set :-P
<}>	xeon-enouf, this is why GNU dont use BSD style http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html#Reading-Non_002dFree-Code

<TinFox>	It forgot it finished two files and attempted to download them a second time
<TinFox>	then asked me if I wanted to rename the new ones because the files it already downloaded were already there

<xeon-enouf>	copies are goodf
<TinFox>	Hey, -usually- it works
<TinFox>	xeon-enouf: I can make copies any time I want :P
<TinFox>	What I dont want to do is waste time downloading the same stuff again on my slow connection
<naphtha>	xeon-enouf: humble PM
<welpo>	Why does this "find" only work when I'm ${HOME}? find "${HOME}"/test/ -mindepth 1 -type f -name *.sh -exec basename {} \; -exec sh {} \; -exec rm -f {} \;
<xeon-enouf>	see, that's why any/all IP and patent law makes no sense; digital bits are almost infinitely reproducible, unlike real-life resources
<}>	welpo, because *.sh is in your $HOME
<}>	when you're in $HOME
<}>	otherwise its in pwd
<xeon-enouf>	so the entire scarcity v. abundance paradigm does not fit ...for the digital space
<triceratux>	but you must take care not to remove the incentive for corporatists to innovate & produce
<welpo>	}: How to fix it, then? pwd/*sh ?
<}>	welpo, $HOME/*.sh
<naphtha>	welpo: make a $home/bin and set that in your path. put all your scripts there.
<}>	I think my vm died
<welpo>	naphtha: I already have that, I just want to fix this alias
<xeon-enouf>	welpo: stop with the ""
<xeon-enouf>	in the way you're using them there
<}>	xeon-enouf, does it matter on what filesystem a qemu vm image is on?
<welpo>	xeon-enouf: What?
<welpo>	What's wrong with them?
<xeon-enouf>	welpo: use '*.sh'
<xeon-enouf>	}: what? qemu lives in ram, no?
<welpo>	That does exactly what I wanted, xeon-enouf. Many thanks
<compdoc>	}, what filesytem you got?
<}>	xeon-enouf, the .qcow2 vm image
<xeon-enouf>	]no idea
<welpo>	Where you talking about these quotes, btw: "${HOME}" ?
<xeon-enouf>	er }
<}>	compdoc, ext4 and ext3, if I copy it from ext4 to ext3 it stops working
<xeon-enouf>	welpo: yes
<xeon-enouf>	s/Where/were/
<compdoc>	}, wow. Never tried that
<naphtha>	xeon-enouf: how did quotes affect that?
<welpo>	xeon-enouf: I was told this way it was (even if it was in very strange cases) less likely to break stuff. Is that not the case?
<xeon-enouf>	welpo: '*.sh'  could be expressed also as \*.sh\*
<xeon-enouf>	naphtha: it's just silly -- i have no idea ; but $HOME/path should suffice
<xeon-enouf>	IF you want to quote
<xeon-enouf>	do "$HOME/path"
<xeon-enouf>	no just the $HOME
<naphtha>	i guess it doesn't translate accordingly in all situations (?)
<}>	compdoc, I tried copying the entire 20g thing twice
<}>	and i dont get it
<xeon-enouf>	welpo: Quoting Variables is always a good idea ... but
<compdoc>	}, what happens at boot?
<xeon-enouf>	welpo: if using bash, see mywiki.wooledge.org
<}>	compdoc, systemd goes crazy and sends me to recovery mode, its as if the qcow is corrupted
<compdoc>	}, the guest in vm uses a simple partition layout?
<welpo>	Yeah I've spent many time there, xeon-enouf, and it was in #bash where that quotation usage was suggested (again, they mentioned it makes very little difference, but it's slightly "safer")
<xeon-enouf>	}: why not try a much smaller file/version -- to test / debug
<compdoc>	what fs does the guest use?
<xeon-enouf>	welpo: also, there's entire major difference between single quotes ', and double qoutes ", ask !greybot even
<compdoc>	if its ext4, running from a ext3 host, maybe its freaking out
<xeon-enouf>	single quotes translate info inside literally
<welpo>	btw, xeon-enouf, ended up using \*.sh\*, the '' version looked like it worked, but then failed
<}>	compdoc, the guest is ext4
<compdoc>	interesting
<naphtha>	welpo: what shell?
<}>	compdoc, its on my backup hdd, if I run virt-manager --connect qemu::///sessions I can use it from the backup hdd, if I copy it to my own hdd it wont work
<}>	 I will try without virt-manager
<xeon-enouf>	welpo: one sec
<xeon-enouf>	welpo: your stringed -exec makes no sense to me; the basename one is fine; why the next ; -exec sh {} \;  ???
<welpo>	naphtha: bash
<welpo>	xeon-enouf: If I'm not mistaken, that runs the scripts
<xeon-enouf>	welpo: since you're just eventually deleting (rm'ing) all the files found
<welpo>	I want the following: List the bash scripts you find in that dir, run them, delete them
<xeon-enouf>	ouch.. ok
<xeon-enouf>	why list them? heh, find them?
<xeon-enouf>	oh welpo .. i see
<xeon-enouf>	you have an issue with PATH
<welpo>	Do I?
<xeon-enouf>	you're executing sh commands on possible PATHs in which the files found are in dirs/ that are NOT in your PATH
<welpo>	And why list them: I just want to know the name of the script running right before its output
<}>	welpo, find -iname '*.sh' -exec sh -c '{} && rm {}' \;
<welpo>	That's right, yes
<}>	welpo, isnt that what you want?
<xeon-enouf>	welpo: the basename, is stripping the absolute PATH/to/file.sh
<welpo>	I know, xeon-enouf
<welpo>	That's what I want lol
<}>	welpo, if you want to print them too add --print
<xeon-enouf>	...

<welpo>	ok
<Remram>	can you use {} inside a quoted string?

<Arven>	I'm looking for a way to disable fbcon on virtual consoles, while using framebuffer (nouveau) for X11
<Arven>	Namely, so I can run dosemu in VGA mode
<}>	Arven, if you're using nouveau you will already have framebuffer support
<aias>	xeon-enouf: it only happens sometimes. i notice it usually after not using the terminal for a while. i type a command in (cleanly, without mistyping), then get this error
<aias>	xeon-enouf: so perhaps whatever causes it is done at the end of a command, or during the time the terminal is not in use
<Arven>	}: right, I know I have framebuffer support. I want to disable it for consoles, as it breaks a few applications
<}>	Arven, you can block kms
<}>	Arven, but I don't know what the consequences will be
<Arven>	}: and still start X11 with nouveau? how?
<}>	Arven, I haven't tried, but isn't it theoretically possible to boot with nomodeset and still start X?
<Arven>	theoretically, X11 would have to set the mode somehow, though
<Arven>	and nouveau supports no UMS
<Arven>	I could use X, with the vesa driver

<d3lphi>	hello all. In Windows 7 (the former OS I used) I was able to right-click on my "My Documents"-->"My Music" folder and change the path so it pointed to my NAS storage / Music share. Every time I clicked on "My Music" I automagically was redirected to that network music share. How can I do that in Debian Jessie with Gnome-Shell ? my music resides on smb:/myNAS/music How should/could I do that?
<Psi-Jack>	d3lphi: You don't.
<Psi-Jack>	You simply make a bookmark link in your file manager to point there.
<Mesourii>	Is Arch a pain to learn?
<Psi-Jack>	Yes
<}>	Mesourii, no
<}>	I'm pretty much an idiot when it comes to linux but manage to use it without problems
<d3lphi>	Psi-Jack: I already am using a bookmark, but that's now what I am trying to achieve. Isn't it possible to somehow to a symbolic link to a network share via CIFS ?
<Psi-Jack>	Sure. If you mount the CIFS share at boot time you /could/ do that, but I wouldn't recommend it.
<Psi-Jack>	Because the way Nautilius mounts CIFS automatically is using user-space mounting of cifs. not kernel space.
<Psi-Jack>	Aka: gvfs.

<wayne>	Psi-Jack: i'm not trolling. i asked a question and you made me feel unwelcomed, and then implied that i'm not capable of making sense nor asking reasonable questions. you don't seem to be interested in helping people at all, just making fun of them as you just did to kryo_

<Rainx>	Hello, Anyone knows, if its possible to mount onedrive/skydrive library through curlftp or something else. "like you can map network drive to onedrive in windows using https://d.docs.live.net/"your CID number" ?
<kryo_>	i did believe you, it's just hard to use linux tar on your 10GB file that you have on your windows disk
<kryo_>	ended up zipping it and uploading it to a server xD
<}>	kryo_, smart move :^)
<rascul>	maybe try this https://github.com/mk-fg/onedrive-fuse-fs
<wayne>	Rainx: i've had experience with onedrive-fuse-fs, it wasn't very reliable for me
<wayne>	if you can swing it, maybe run Windows in a VM and use the MS-built onedrive syncing
<Psi-Jack>	Heh. Microsoft OneDrive? Yeah, go figure. :)
<wayne>	well, this sort of goes back to my question about is fuse buggy or is the software that uses fuse buggy? or maybe both.
<Rainx>	rascul: Thanks I will give it a try...
<Psi-Jack>	wayne: It's not FUSE itself.
<Psi-Jack>	Now that you provided some level of detail pertaining to your actual question, some information can be attained to summarize a base answer. :p
<Rainx>	wayne: It might not be reliable, I have to use it for archive in a project, so VM and syncing is not really an option..
<d3lphi>	I could run a mount -t cifs //mynas/music /home/johndoe/Music -o user=jdoe
<Psi-Jack>	d3lphi: Except you can't do that as your user. And is still a bad idea.
<d3lphi>	that work's fine and exactly what I expected when user johndoe opens the Music icon, he sees the content of smb:/mynas/music, but only root can do such a mount :(
<Psi-Jack>	Uh huh.
<wayne>	Rainx: maybe look at https://github.com/xybu/onedrive-d too then
<d3lphi>	Psi-Jack: is there really no other way with GVFS/userspace ? mount -o bind also wouldn't work, because it needs root privileges
<Rainx>	wayne: will do, thanks
<Psi-Jack>	d3lphi: There is no recommended way but the userspace method for what you're specifically trying to do. You could, however, if you want the mount persistent, to mount it into /mnt/Music, so long as your CIFS share never goes down, or you're never disconnected from it.
<Psi-Jack>	EVER. :P
<d3lphi>	Psi-Jack: or use the fstab and use a credentials file (which only root has read-access) ?
<d3lphi>	and do the mount as I've written down already?
<Psi-Jack>	d3lphi: I wouldn't mount such a thing directly into your home, again.
<wayne>	Psi-Jack: thanks. i'm trying to figure out if FUSE is reliable enough to write non-trivial software for as i don't see any FUSE-based software actively used in production
<Psi-Jack>	wayne: Big projects like Ceph and GlusterFS utilize FUSE. It's stable enough for them to use it.
<d3lphi>	Psi-Jack: as I am already using a bookmark to access this network share, it should be mounted (user-space, GVFS) somewhere. Where is that GVFS path in gnome-shell ?
<wayne>	ah didn't know glusterfs used it, that gives me confidence
<chaospsychex>	how do I find/access the 'GNU Make Manual' on my system? Is it even installed by default ?
<chaospsychex>	man someCMD ?

<}>	chaospsychex, what? you do realize its the same thing
<}>	from your link
<}>	literally the same thing
<chaospsychex>	no, info make has a section that says "SEE ALSO: The GNU Make Manual"
<chaospsychex>	which is more content
<rascul>	if the info page isn't installed then it's probably just pulling up the man page
<}>	what rascul said, there's no "SEE ALSO" in my info make

<chaospsychex>	yes info make is the same as man make

<chaospsychex>	i see the standard info docs in /usr/share/info though
<chaospsychex>	i need to download ALL man pages
<rascul>	maybe info pages are considered extra documentation
<rascul>	debian does make-doc, makes sense then that ubuntu and mint also do it

<rascul>	louisdk what filesystem is on it?

<louisdk>	NeddySeagoon, the problem is that fdisk shows the partitions while parted shows a single fat16 which is quite confusing.
<NeddySeagoon>	louisdk  Is the drive GPT ?  is the single partitin type ee ?
<pie_>	is there any reason accessing a /dev/video0 device over sshfs would not work?
<NeddySeagoon>	louisdk: Partition Table: loop ... parted is not seeing the partiton tabe.  Why does it say Partition Table: loop?
<louisdk>	NeddySeagoon, good question.
<louisdk>	NeddySeagoon, Search for "loop partition parted" gave me some ideas. Might help to rewrite MBR without ereasing the disk.
<Psi-Jack>	pie_: Yes, many reasons.
<pie_>	Psi-Jack: ok :C why not though?
<NeddySeagoon>	louisdk: why do you want to rewrite the MBR?  Your partition table is there
<Psi-Jack>	pie_: For starters, permissions.
<pie_>	Psi-Jack: excluding permissiong
<pie_>	*permissions
<Psi-Jack>	What is your actual goal, and hopefully you're not doing this with root.
<pie_>	I have a webcam plugged into a headless machine and I want to check that it works. The remote is actually freebsd but my local is debian
<Psi-Jack>	Well then...
<}>	you're accessing a freebsd /dev/video0 on debian
<louisdk>	NeddySeagoon, something's not right since parted says my partition table is "loop".
<Psi-Jack>	Yes.. /completely/ different thing, entirely.
<pie_>	}: now that you mention it...
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<Psi-Jack>	pie_: Instead, install an X application on the bsd box and remotely run that X application to your local desktop X server.
<pie_>	though i would actually guess its the same since it's v4l and a compatibility layer, but oh well.
<Psi-Jack>	That would let you access said webcam that is. :)
<pie_>	Psi-Jack: I was thinking of that but I would have to install x on the remote. I might as well...
<NeddySeagoon>	louisdk: Its not seeing a partition table at all.  The partition starts at sector 0, like a floppy.  Flopies are FAT16 ...

<louisdk>	NeddySeagoon, and that's what i'm trying to fix. Since fdisk has no problems showing the ext4+swap partitions and they can easily be mounted, sdb is not a fat device.
<}>	reisio, everyone knows a guy from clearwater florida?
<reisio>	}: that, too
<oo_miguel>	Ok, I had to enable "configure standard kernel features" in order to be able to change this setting

<louisdk>	NeddySeagoon, how do I do that? Which command/tool do I need to use?
<NeddySeagoon>	louisdk  hexedit /dev/sdb   then paste whatever you get in the terminal.  Ctrl-C  to exit.   You need te be root
<louisdk>	NeddySeagoon, http://pastebin.com/zis4iyv1
<NeddySeagoon>	louisdk: There is a correct msdos partition table there  along with a grub stage1
<NeddySeagoon>	louisdk: As sdb is external,  I suspect that parted is using commands that the external controller does not support

<louisdk>	NeddySeagoon, Before my old Thinkpad T61p died I used the drive in the laptop. It worked fine but had the same issue. Thanks for you help for far. I might just use cfdisk to manage the drive.
<Psi-Jack>	Now then! Fully chef-ized my home cluster. :D
<almostdvs>	What is the equivalent of apt-get update && apt-get upgrade for fedora?
<NeddySeagoon>	louisdk: The partition table is fine.  Its just that parted cannot see it for some reason
<MetaNova>	almostdvs: what package manager does Fedora use?
<Psi-Jack>	MetaNova: rpm/yum
<MetaNova>	then I'd suggest 'man yum' almostdvs
<almostdvs>	MetaNova: yum
<louisdk>	NeddySeagoon, Cool. I'll just use (c)fdisk. Thx again for your help :)
<Psi-Jack>	almostdvs: Well, technically the package manager is rpm. yum is the repository manager. :)
<pie_>	Psi-Jack: ive been meaning do do something like that myself, any experience with cfengine? ive never actually used a config management tool before
<Psi-Jack>	Bleh.
<Psi-Jack>	cfengine is fscking HORRIBLE
<almostdvs>	Psi-Jack: am i correct in thinking that it's just yum update.  no 2 part update then upgrade necessary?
<Psi-Jack>	almostdvs: To do what?
<Psi-Jack>	yum automatically updates its own cache when it's old, unlike apt. You can, however, force it with yum makecache
<almostdvs>	Psi-Jack: I just installed fedora to learn something other than deb/ubuntu derivatives.
<almostdvs>	Psi-Jack: so I was just trying to get current
<Psi-Jack>	yum upgrade will upgrade all packages.
<almostdvs>	nice. thanks
<Psi-Jack>	heh, seems I forgot to add one of my newer vm's, my gitlab server, to chef.. Easy fix. :)
<mewmewMaLazerBea>	hi guys i got a question what is the syntax to find all read and writable files for ww-data user ?
<Psi-Jack>	mewmewMaLazerBea: find
<MrElendig>	mewmewMaLazerBea: man find
<CHVNX>	find / -perm /u=rw   perhaps
<Psi-Jack>	Forgot the actual user. :p
<CHVNX>	find / -user user -perm /u=rw   perhaps
<Psi-Jack>	Which doesn't really include ACL stuff at all if applicable.
<fread2281>	is there any way to be notified of change in battery charge?
<Psi-Jack>	pie_: chef and salt are two management systems I'd recommend. chef being much more powerful and development-savvy, while salt is fast, though can be bumpy at times with updates to the salt stack.
<Psi-Jack>	pie_: I've used cfengine, puppet, salt, chef, and ansible, and chef sticks out to me to be the most powerful of them all.
<Psi-Jack>	Powerful, and versatile. :)

<yumbox>	there are multiple firewalls for linux
<yumbox>	best way to stay safe is to update regularly and to not download dumb shit
<andygmb>	for sure, but not every user is a superuser :p
<andygmb>	(in the sense of knowing to not download dumb shit)
<ceil>	dumb people deserve it
<ceil>	<.<
<triceratux>	andygmb: most viruses are incurred by surfing seedy parts of the web like pr0n & mp3 sites. most opportunistic viruses that are deployed there target windows machines because thats what 99% of consumer grade surfers are running
<andygmb>	triceratux: does that mean if someone starts targetting linux instead, you're shit outta luck? I ask because I want to understand what makes linux inherently safer or is it literally just the fact that there's less viruses (which I don't think is a good reason)
<ceil>	andygmb: no, because the average linux user being smarter than the average windows user, that shotgun attack vector still just wouldn't be as effective : p
<triceratux>	andygmb: theres so little incentive to mess with gnu/linux machines that when the virus hackers actually tool up for it therell be plenty of notice. & the linux community is quite adriot technically so the reaction will be swift
<ceil>	triceratux: that was a much nicer way of putting it, but yeah : )
*	bazhang_ is now known as bazhang
<adsjlkdk>	whats a free vpn for the linux operation systems
<CHVNX>	adsjlkdk: There are plenty of them. Ask google.
<annihilannic>	adsjlkdk: a free vpn what?  service?  software?
<andygmb>	triceratux / ceil you can understand how i could see that as being a bad way to handle security though? "there's less incentive" - shouldn't security be defensive and not reactionary?
<toothe>	what ist he point of a PGP subkey?
<adsjlkdk>	annihilannic: software
<annihilannic>	adsjlkdk: openvpn
<annihilannic>	adsjlkdk: and softether.. are the main ones I know of
<annihilannic>	andygmb: who says that it isn't defensive as well?
<pikaro>	my NEtworkManager VPN connection just crashed, and if I try to reconnect manually, nothing happens. I suppose there's a logfile somewhere, but dmesg and grepping -i for VPN in /var/log show nothing faulty (" Dispatching action 'vpn-up' for tun0" being the last message in a connection attempt) - does someone know here I should look?
<triceratux>	andygmb: yeah, if there were anything to defend against. linux users are generally content to build systems from audited repos & secure kernel images. most of the downloading "from the wild" is in the far more flexible windows ecosystem. windows isnt tidy & compact by design; thats why you need both av & registry cleaning software, & lots of it
<triceratux>	andygmb: also because windows is closed & proprietary it requires macaffeeesque efforts to create av software. because the linux source is available it can be (& is) audited, evaluated, & improved readily by anyone in the community
<triceratux>	andygmb: in short, noone knows what vulnerabilities lurk in windows. anyone can verify that essentially none lurk in gnu/linux
<andygmb>	so I should more so be asking "why does windows need antivirus?" :p
<pikaro>	andygmb, because it's common and thus a common target. no need for illogical superiority.
<andygmb>	I wouldn't take what I said as illogical superiority, more i'm asking is my assumption of needing an anti virus in the first place a false assumption?
<pikaro>	linux has its security holes as well, although the permission model eliminates far more of them than early Windowses.
<phogg>	triceratux: Everything has vulnerabilities. In Linux there's little chance of obvious problems being swept under the rug to avoid embarrassment.
<pikaro>	just look at the recent SSL debacle for an example - open source isn't bulletproof by definition.
<phogg>	andygmb: Windows needs antivirus software because (1) Too much time was spent will all users logging in as root, (2) Windows offers to execute things too readily.
<Nomaska>	I'm using Ubuntu on VBox, anyone know how to make it have a higher resolution?
<reisio>	pikaro: what're you talking about, it's fixed
<reisio>	Nomaska: install guest additions
<Nomaska>	Already got them installed.
<phogg>	Nomaska: In X the screen resolution is controlled via xrandr on the command line, or various GUI tools.
<andygmb>	reisio: it's fixed after a bunch of potential damage though?
<reisio>	andygmb: and if it were closed source, it wouldn't be fixed at all
<Nomaska>	Xrandr?
<reisio>	there will always be bugs
<Nomaska>	Run that on the terminal?
<reisio>	with open source, they get fixed
<andygmb>	I agree with pikaro in that OSS definitely does not mean inherently secure
<andygmb>	and its a bad assumption to make
<triceratux>	the ssl thing wasnt a debacle; it was a triumph. it was spotted by analysts at google & the fix was rapidly & widely implemented
<reisio>	moreover, what people lost was information they treated poorly anyway
<reisio>	andygmb: developed open source does
<reisio>	just having the source open does not
<reisio>	Nomaska: what de/wm are you using?
<Nomaska>	De/wm?
<pikaro>	reisio, yes now, of course, but AFAIK the codebase is a disaster that discourages people from fixing it. i. e. something that may _definitely_ happen looking at the average person's coding standards, i. e. a proof of open source not being inherently sexure.
<Nomaska>	I'm new to Linux and virtualization.
<reisio>	Nomaska: ordinary Ubuntu?
<Nomaska>	Oh, 14.0
<Nomaska>	Maybe 14.4.
<phogg>	andygmb: the recent bash fiasco is a great example of open source security. It was a big problem, but sysadmins didn't need to wait for vendors to fix it. As soon as the bug was known anyone could cut the code path out and recompile, patches were available within hours, distro security updates soon after. Fast reaction times/
<Nomaska>	Lemme check.
<reisio>	pikaro: if it's developed open source, the code will be naturally less of a disaster, because it would have to be for people to bother with it
<pikaro>	just look at truecrypt for a parrallel.
<reisio>	truecrypt was developed in a closet
<Nomaska>	14.0.4
<reisio>	it is indeed a good example, of why development as open source is more important than merely having open source
<Nomaska>	Err. 14.04.2
<Nomaska>	Thats the version I use.
<reisio>	Nomaska: you reboot since installing guest additions?
<Nomaska>	Yes.
<pikaro>	reisio, if something as important as ssl can have disastrous code, everything should be assumed to be as bad unless there is definite prooof to the contrary.
<phogg>	reisio: With open source you also tend to clean things up and make them nicer before releasing, because you know someone will look and say "WTF is this junk?!"
<reisio>	pikaro: yup, everything should be assumed bad
<reisio>	pikaro: it's just the open source will end up being less bad
<phogg>	reisio: No way to take shortcuts with everybody looking over your shoulder
<reisio>	indeed
<reisio>	just that*
<CHVNX>	outdeed
<Nomaska>	How do I know if guest additions installed?
<CHVNX>	lsmod
<Nomaska>	I did the command, but the second command didn't work.
<CHVNX>	Or, try installing them
<reisio>	Nomaska: what commands?
<CHVNX>	the second
<Nomaska>	Pulling em up.
<pikaro>	reisio, yes, _will end up_. not _is_.
<CHVNX>	Push them down.
<Nomaska>	sudo apt-get upgrade
<Nomaska>	Oooooooooh, I missed one...
<Nomaska>	Lmfao.
<pikaro>	reisio, exactly because of said approach.
<reisio>	pikaro: will end up, and given any short amount of time already is, yup
<Nomaska>	I'll reinstall them real quick.
<reisio>	pikaro: show me the non-less-secure closed source alternative :p
<triceratux>	plus doze has activex rofl https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/ActiveX
<pikaro>	reisio, I could if I had their sources, but too much important crap relies on security through obscurity
<reisio>	you couldn't even then
<reisio>	next batter
<reisio>	gotta go play with a disk now anyway
<pikaro>	reisio, so that's a futile argument to make
<oo_miguel>	I wonder how I can tell m4 to expand a macro that follows some plaintext (Without space): e.g: foooobar__THIS_MACRO_TO_EXPAND_I_WANT__
<CHVNX>	reisio: be careful. Playing with your disk too often will make you go blind.
<Nomaska>	Really? I never went blind.
<Nomaska>	And no, I'm not Jewish.
<CHVNX>	What does Judaism have to do with anything?
<Nomaska>	Idk, lmfao. I was turning the joke into something different.
<reisio>	CHVNX: very popular
<CHVNX>	איסור הוצאת זרע לבטלה
<reisio>	as long as I don't go deaf, we're good
<Nomaska>	If I go deaf, I'll be pissed.
<Nomaska>	No more metal.
<reisio>	ditto
<Nomaska>	;-;
<nicolagreco>	Imagine I want to access the blocks of file /hello/file. How many inodes should I walt through?
<reisio>	s/metal/music/
*	nicolagreco is now known as nicola
<pikaro>	CHVNX, old testament -> onan -> punishment for masturbation <-> "playing with your disk"
<Nomaska>	Reisio, got a smartphone?
<Nomaska>	Search up Musica Metal.
<Nomaska>	It has a list of every genre, then a list of every band, then a list of their best songs.
<CHVNX>	Speaking of metal and linux, listen to metal produced on Linux: https://varituuk.bandcamp.com  -- pay what you want, free music (unless you opt to make it non-gratis)
<Nomaska>	Its on the play store.
<CHVNX>	I can garuntee is does not have every band, or even most of the good ones.
<Nomaska>	Well, it doesn't have EVERY bamd.
<Nomaska>	But I guarantee it has a shit ton of the good ones.
<CHVNX>	guarantee*
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: name drop some good metal bands that it has.
<CHVNX>	Randomly.
<Nomaska>	Name drop?
<Nomaska>	Randomly name drop? o.o
<Nomaska>	What do you mean?
<CHVNX>	List. Cite. Tell me the nsame of some fo the good metal on that service.
<CHVNX>	names*
<Nomaska>	Hellsaw, Darkthrone, Edge of Sanity, Watain.
<reisio>	Jimi Hendrix, the original heavy metal, is music
<reisio>	modern metal...
<reisio>	:p
<Nomaska>	Only problem is that the death metal category is plagued with deathcore.
<Nomaska>	Eww.
<Nomaska>	I've never been a fan of Jimi.,
<CHVNX>	Hendrix was not, and has never been considered, heavy metal.
<CHVNX>	The first metal band is considered to be black Sabbath.
<reisio>	if I wanted to listen to white noise, I'd go ahead
<pikaro>	ehhhh... hendrix "original metal"? never heard that before
<Nomaska>	D:
<nicola>	Imagine I want to access the blocks of file /hello/file. How many inodes should I walk through?
<reisio>	CHVNX: thou art wrong
<reisio>	rafb
*	SirCmpwn is now known as SirCmpwnTest
<Nomaska>	Original metal... Ozzy.
<CHVNX>	reisio: If you want to listen to white noise... https://chvnx.bandcamp.com
*	SirCmpwnTest is now known as SirCmpwn
<Nomaska>	Hey, I love black metal. I don't care if its white noise, bahaha.
<CHVNX>	reisio: I am not wrong. Classic "rock" is not hard rock is not heavy metal, you fucking pleb.
<Nomaska>	But yes, it is white noise.
<Nomaska>	:P
<ayecee>	nicola: how many blocks must a man walk through, before he is truly a man?
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: did you get the link to my black metal project?
<Nomaska>	Relink.
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: http://varituuk.bandcamp.com
<CHVNX>	Instrumental black/doom/noise metal
<Nomaska>	Instrumental?
<Nomaska>	No vocals?
<pikaro>	BM is only white noise because insists on terrible recording standards
<Nomaska>	True, true.
<Nomaska>	How does this site work?
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: The demo 'H" has lyrics/vocals.
<reisio>	CHVNX: the term heavy metal was coined specifically for Jimi Hendrix :p
<Nomaska>	Just click on something?
<reisio>	"metal" is something else entirely at this point
<reisio>	usually just noise
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: Yes. Click on a demo/album, and then stream or downlaod the audio for free.
<Nomaska>	The term heavy metal was coined for Motorhead...
<reisio>	Nomaska: nope
<Nomaska>	So this is how Bandcamp works.
<reisio>	don't be young _and_ ignorant, pick one
<CHVNX>	reisio: You literally sound old and stupid right now.  Perhaps discussing a topic you ahve no knowledge of isn't in your best interests. :)
<Nomaska>	I am listening to Kaos Lord.
<reisio>	CHVNX: mmhmmm
<pikaro>	reisio, link -> proof?
<Nomaska>	This is good so far.
<reisio>	Nomaska: 'course you are
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: It was released a few days ago.
<reisio>	pikaro: it'd be the first search result, do it yourself
<Nomaska>	If you like this, you should try Dreams from Hellsaw.
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: I own Hellsaw's Phantasm album.
<Nomaska>	Really? I found out about them yesterday.
<CHVNX>	I generally dislike that kind of black metal, but, it's not bad.
<Nomaska>	Whats your taste?
<reisio>	pink metal :p
<Nomaska>	If I wanted pink metal, I'd listen to Pantera.
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: Their first record could easily be decribed as "pink".
<Nomaska>	:P
<CHVNX>	http://www.last.fm/tag/pink%20metal
<CHVNX>	I'm not joking, though.
<Nomaska>	Panteras? Or Hellsaws.
<Nomaska>	Opeth is here, bahaha.
<Nomaska>	Maiden.
<Nomaska>	Bon Jovi, Cradle.
<pikaro>	reisio, although I do appreciate the (unfortunately becoming rare) "rtfm" approach, the first link, i. e. Wikipedia, merely lists hendrix as influential, which no sane person would deny.
<Nomaska>	CHVNX: ever hear of Devin Townsend?
<pikaro>	AFAIK, "heavy metal" became common around priest's time.
<CHVNX>	Jimmy Hendrix is not, nor was he ever considered, a heavy metal musician.  It's just another case of the incredibly ignorant making claims that are outlandish.
<pikaro>	*a common term
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: Of course. His music is shit.
<Nomaska>	Heavy metal became big during the NWOBHM.
<Nomaska>	You sir.
<Nomaska>	Have your opinion, that will not influence mine.
<Nomaska>	Lmao.
<Nomaska>	Devin Townsend is incredible.l
<CHVNX>	I come from a generation raised on punk and metal.  Real punk, real metal. Not this watered down commercialized bullshit that passes for metal on the radio.
<Nomaska>	But I will admit, his good songs are amazing, his bad songs are utter srhit.
<reisio>	pikaro: the first link for what, 'durrr learn me how to search for something easily found'?
<Nomaska>	Watered down stuff? Like what?
<Nomaska>	-core?
<Nomaska>	For emos?
<reisio>	https://www.google.com/search?q=%22heavy%20metal%22%20%22jimi%20hendrix%22%20%22coined%22
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: I was raised on hardcore, it runs through my veins. Deathcore is not entitled to appropiate the -core.
<reisio>	I feel like that makes you at least 13, then
<CHVNX>	My beard is at least 13.
<reisio>	heheh
<Nomaska>	Deathcore is horrible.
<Nomaska>	I cant even fathom why emos throw shit fits when people go "It isn't metal".
<pikaro>	reisio, it appears you're stuck in your google bubble, that was what I googled with no bubble to speak of
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: It's metal. It's 101% metal. It's just not good metal.
<Nomaska>	It is not metal.
<Zigelin>	Hey. Can I function well without having to install a "desktop" like kde, xfce etc? I mean just running Arch and Xorg (or blackbox/openbox)
<ayecee>	Zigelin: yes
<Nomaska>	Death comes from its influences, -core comes from hardcore.
<Nomaska>	Hardcore is rock.
<Nomaska>	Grindcore I will accept as metal, lmao.
<Nomaska>	But metalcore and deathcore have no place.
<pikaro>	Zigelin, of course!
<Zigelin>	Hm ok thanks. I want to keep it simple :)
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: It literally is metal. I understand your emotions about the music, but Deathcore is in no way related to hardcore. It adopts the -core from the use of breakdowns, however, breakdowns in death metal are a common thing.  Name a single deathcore band that sounds like a typical hardcore band, such as Agnostic Front or Gorilla Busicuts.
<reisio>	pikaro: nope, but you might be
<pikaro>	Zigelin, a desktop environment is just for interaction of the associated applications - you can use them standalone, but expect some inconveniences
<Nomaska>	I don't listen to hardcore.
<ayecee>	music circlejerk in progress
<CHVNX>	Metalcore is not what you assume it is, either, I'll assume. There are hundreds of bands that mix metallic riffs into their hardcore.  Literally metalcore, whoch is predated by crossover (thrash and hardcore mixed). Are you suggesting bands like Strife, Sworn Enemy, or Terror are bad?
<Nomaska>	I figure the only "hardcore" band I know, if it fits the category, is Suicide Silence.
<Zigelin>	pikaro, Why inconveniences
<CHVNX>	ayecee: Im a big fan of the Circle Jerks, actually,.
<reisio>	CHVNX: :) http://i.imgur.com/Q8KZc1p.jpg
<reisio>	beats rhomboid jerks
<Nomaska>	I'm suggesting that bands where the members wear tight pants, have straightened hair, and slices down their wrists, are not metal.
<Nomaska>	Metal is for men, and women.
<CHVNX>	reisio: My Debian beard is Debianish.
<Nomaska>	Keyword men, in the word women.
<Nomaska>	Not for boys.
<reisio>	CHVNX: natch
<Nomaska>	Satyricon is pretty good.
<reisio>	you can get drunk and be useless while listening to actual melodies, too
<reisio>	honest
<Nomaska>	I prefer getting stoned and listening to metal.
<pikaro>	Zigelin, things like dragging and dropping abstract things (like, say, folders into a disc-burning application) may sometimes not work. but nothing extreme enough to use a DE in my experience
<CHVNX>	I'm getting drunk and listening to some very melodic metal.
<pikaro>	(just a random example, you get the picture)
<toothe>	what's the best way to run wpa_supplicant at boot?
<CHVNX>	toothe: carefully
<reisio>	would take a lot of peyote to make it melodic
<toothe>	lol
<CHVNX>	edit /etc/network/interfaces
<Zigelin>	pikaro, Yes I see. Well, couldn't nautilus work if I install blackbox for example?
<pikaro>	reisio, I hope Tor + VPN + various privacy addons discourage google from bubbling me
<Nomaska>	Is there a such thing as a free VPN...?
<toothe>	im trying to setup my PI to auto connect to a wifi network.
<Nomaska>	I have uses of a VPN, but I cant pay for one.
<ayecee>	toothe: i wonder if someone has ever done that before and blogged it.
<toothe>	ayecee: Google is failing me
<reisio>	IME clearing your sessions/cothere's alwaygo, et al.
<reisio>	hrmmm, i/o
<Nomaska>	Question, can I move my folders from Windows to Linux?
<reisio>	/cookies is enough, but there's alwas duckduckgo,
<Nomaska>	I'm virtualizing Linux.
<pikaro>	Zigelin, you could, you'll just have to install the dependencies which are closely tied with nautilus' DE. I can recommend ROX filer as a virtually standalone alternative, there are others as well.
<reisio>	Nomaska: sure
<Nomaska>	How do I do it?
<reisio>	Nomaska: why do you want to
<CHVNX>	http://i.chvnx.com/linuxing.jpg  <-- this is how to linux
<Nomaska>	Because the programs I have on Windows don't work, I need to run them on Linux.
<ayecee>	toothe: http://www.google.com/search?q=raspberry+pi+wpa_supplicant+start
<ayecee>	toothe: first result.
<reisio>	Nomaska: what programs?
<Nomaska>	Lmfao, I got a 404 error.
<Nomaska>	Aircrack, Wireshark.
<Nomaska>	And a few more.
<CHVNX>	http://i.chvnx.com/img/linuxing.jpg
<CHVNX>	Forgot which dir I saved it to
<Nomaska>	Lmfao.
<Nomaska>	Brutal beard.
<reisio>	Nomaska: your distro's package manager
<Nomaska>	My distros package manager?
<reisio>	yup
<Nomaska>	How do I use that?
<CHVNX>	Which distro are you using?
<Nomaska>	Ubuntu 14.04.2
<CHVNX>	sudo apt-get install name_of_package
<pikaro>	Nomaska, IIRC guest additions to vbox allow for inter-os d&d with a few hoops. never seriously tested that, though.
<reisio>	Nomaska: what CHVNX said
<CHVNX>	apt-cache search name_of_package
<Nomaska>	Still installing my guest additions.
<CHVNX>	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
<reisio>	few hoops indeed, but he doesn't need to be transferring awful .bin's or the like
<CHVNX>	optionally: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
<Nomaska>	Okay.
<Nomaska>	No, I have everything uncompiled in .rars.
<Nomaska>	None of it is binary.
<Nomaska>	Just the files.
<pikaro>	Nomaska, unless those files are pure text, they're binaries
<CHVNX>	You dont need to compile packages if they are in your distros repos. The WORST mistake novice Linux users make is to install from sournce when they dont need to.
<CHVNX>	They still think like Windows users in that regard.
<CHVNX>	source*
<Nomaska>	So, how would I go about installing stuff onto Linux.
<Zigelin>	pikaro, Or I don't need any GUI at all, just base install and ranger :p
<CHVNX>	Ranger? Why the hell would you need ranger when coreutils work just as well, if not better?
<CHVNX>	cp, mv, rm, cat > ranger/mc/whatever shitty app you want to use
<reisio>	Nomaska: scroll up for 'apt-get'
<Zigelin>	Because I say so.
*	sauvin uses mc and doesn't call it 'shitty'
<Nomaska>	So I use apt-get?
<pikaro>	yeah exactly! and blackbox with rox-filer >>>>> cli in terms of convenience.
<reisio>	you don't have to flail around like a drunk octopus on Unix, you just say 'hey install this' and it's done
<reisio>	Nomaska: yes, or you can use a GUI if you want
<reisio>	Nomaska: look for a stupid icon on the left
<Nomaska>	Stupid icon on the left? Lmao.
<Nomaska>	Like?
<Nomaska>	I have a bunch.
<reisio>	I forget, like a box or something
<Nomaska>	To search?
<reisio>	no
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: open a terminal emulator
<reisio>	to install packages
<CHVNX>	Perhaps yoru shitty distro calls it "terminal"
<Nomaska>	I have terminal up.
<pikaro>	Nomaska, ubuntu, IIRC? look for some "enter command" box in your start menu any type "synaptic"
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: inside terminal, type:  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
<Nomaska>	Yes, Ubuntu.
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: If you want to search for a specific package or term, use  apt-cache search whatever_words
<Nomaska>	I'm still installing guest additions, gimme a sec.
<toothe>	man...im really having a hard time getting ANYTHING working lately.
<CHVNX>	toothe: such as...?
<toothe>	CHVNX: this wpa_supplicant at boot time.
<Nomaska>	So, what does apt do.
<CHVNX>	toothe: Do you want to use dhcp?
<Nomaska>	Like, whats its role.
<toothe>	yes.
<pikaro>	Nomaska, the apt-get things the others are saying are for terminal, which some find more convenient; synaptic is the graphical equivalent
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: apt installs/uninstalls packages, and can be used to search for other packages etcv
<reisio>	don't think ubuntu uses synaptic by default anymore
<CHVNX>	Read the ******* manual.
<Nomaska>	There's a fucking manual?
<toothe>	CHVNX: I hate it when people say that to me!!!
<CHVNX>	toothe: We harte having to say it.
<pikaro>	reisio, relly? what else? been a while, tbh
<CHVNX>	hate*
<Nomaska>	Wait, was the manual thing directed at me or TOothe, bahaha.
<pikaro>	*really
<toothe>	lol, probably not me.
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: in terminal, type  man man
<toothe>	i only ocme into IRC *after* having exhausted google or the mnaul.
<toothe>	manual*
<Nomaska>	Can you issue commands while terminal is working?
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: then type  man apt-get
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: open a second terminal
<Nomaska>	Or will it interrupt.l
<Nomaska>	Oh.
<reisio>	pikaro: some ugly icon on the left
<CHVNX>	Or, a new tab.
<reisio>	nobody listens
<reisio>	:p
<CHVNX>	reisio: describe it as the anti-right.
<Nomaska>	Okay, I ran man man.
<reisio>	on the anti-right
<CHVNX>	non-beautiful icon on the anti-right
<Nomaska>	It tells me...
<Nomaska>	LOts of stuff.
<Nomaska>	It wont let me type man apt-get.
<toothe>	so...i setup my /etc/network/interface file as such: http://dpaste.com/3W40Q3H
<pikaro>	wow, I never ran "man man" before. I really though it would just say "you're an idiot".
<toothe>	i was expecting it to automaticaly trigger wpa_supplicant, but it didn't.
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: what do you mean, it won't let you?
<toothe>	so, this doesn't get me online.
<toothe>	yes, I googled this failed answer.
<Nomaska>	It blocks my text, I have to press h or q.
<nicola>	can someone else help here? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30157755/understanding-read-write-speed-of-raid-5
<pikaro>	Nomaska, man <something> just gives you an explanation of how to use a command - a manual. "man man" is thus a bit redunant.
<Nomaska>	Oooooooooooh.
<toothe>	when I boot up, my wpa_suplicant configuration does nothing.
<toothe>	how do I make it automatically run when I boot up?
<Nomaska>	Okay, that makes sense.
<CHVNX>	Is the syntax and information in the wpa configs correct?
<toothe>	surely there's a way to do this manually...
<toothe>	CHVNX: yes, so If I run the command manually, it'll run.
<CHVNX>	toothe: Let me show you an example /etc/network/interfaces
<CHVNX>	Oh wait, I dont have a laptop on the network righht now
<toothe>	:-(
<toothe>	google failed....
<toothe>	i'd rather just do this manually...like, edit a /etc/rc.d file?
<CHVNX>	https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/3852/start-wireless-network-automatically-on-boot-up-how-to
<CHVNX>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/WPA_supplicant#At_boot_.28systemd.29
<toothe>	that's the document I went through.
<CHVNX>	https://wiki.debian.org/WiFi/HowToUse#wpa_supplicant
<toothe>	i know how to use it :-)
<CHVNX>	Apparently not, though.
<Nomaska>	Burn.
<pikaro>	Nomaska, and if ubuntu is set up like debian, the output you see from man is displayed by the less command. in that case,"q" exits to the commandline, and "/" lets you search, and arrows / pgup / pgdown / home /end work as expected. lots of other keybindings, for more info type "man less" in the commandline.
<Nomaska>	:P
<toothe>	I think I got it working...i just went through /etc/rc.local
<toothe>	got fed up :-)
<Nomaska>	Guest additions finally installed.
<CHVNX>	Reboot.
<CHVNX>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=fuEJWmxWkKw#t=9
<Nomaska>	Wtfthatiscreepy
<Nomaska>	I rebooted, log in as normal?
<CHVNX>	Or as abnormal, whichever you prefer.
<reisio>	try and do it while singing a song
<Nomaska>	This looks much better.
<annihilannic>	nicola: the max read speed will still be 4x if one of the disks is dead.  you only need to read from 4 of them to get a complete picture of the data.
<Nomaska>	Not to see about installing aircrack.
<reisio>	weren't they going to reboot reboot?
<Nomaska>	So, with Ubuntu, I want to install from source.
<Nomaska>	Correct?
<reisio>	nope
<Nomaska>	What?
<annihilannic>	nicola: i think the theoretical max write speed would be about 50mb/s, raid5 writes need a read, recalc, rewrite.  but that figure would be very optimistic...
<reisio>	just use apt-get, or the installation GUI on the left
<pikaro>	Nomaska, sudo apt-get install aircrack from the commandline, or start software center and search and click.
<CHVNX>	aircrack-ng probably
<Nomaska>	Holy Jesus.
<Nomaska>	Yeah, it was -ng.
<pikaro>	CHVNX, thanks - sorry Nomaska
<Nomaska>	How do I set it up?
<reisio>	apt-cache search aircrack would've gotten it
<Nomaska>	Can I put icons on my main screen?
<Nomaska>	Or only on the side bar.
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: these are rudimentary problems that you should be asking in #ubuntu
<Nomaska>	Now how do I get aircrack to use? Pm it to me please, brb.
<Nomaska>	Oh.
<Nomaska>	I'll ask in there then.
<Nomaska>	:P
<CHVNX>	However, I doubt you'll get very much support from that channel. It's filled with people much like you.
<Nomaska>	Noobs?
<CHVNX>	Novice users.
<Nomaska>	Well, I'm not trying to be a bother.
<CHVNX>	You're not. I'm just trying to direct you to more relevant streams.
<Nomaska>	I appreciate it.
<Nomaska>	How long have you used Linux?
<CHVNX>	Since 1982.
<spreeuw>	how do i pass air from my crack
<pikaro>	no idea about the desktop question - re: "install from source", no you definitely do not want to do that with ubuntu. "from source" means you get the code itself and build it yourself so you can make adjustments - that's something reserved for fringe cases and pros. ubuntu has the philosophy of suppplying absolutely anything pre-compiled, i. e. already built for you. more convenient, less customizable.
<spreeuw>	small tip: rtfm
<Nomaska>	So source would be if I wanted to edit the coding, then I'd still need to compile it.
<Nomaska>	Rtfm?
<CHVNX>	RTFM - read the fucking manual
<Nomaska>	Oh.
<pikaro>	Nomaska, exactly
<Nomaska>	Kinda hard when I don't know the commands.
<Nomaska>	But I'm googling it as we speak.
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: Are you a developer? Obviously not. That means that there's a very slim chance you will ever need the source code for popular applications. The repositories for Ubuntu have tens of thousands of packages. Literally tens of thousands of software packages/applications/libraries to install.
<CHVNX>	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto
<CHVNX>	RTFW
<pikaro>	Nomaska, the commands you're currently entering are a far cry from actually editing programming code. do try to look at it sometime if you're interested in the internals, but coding is different from just telling your system what to do
<Nomaska>	I know the differences, I've dabbled slightly in coding. But I'm a novice user, and I've heard tell about compiling programs.
<CHVNX>	pikaro: technically, everything you enter into bash is programming. Weird to say, but literally true.
<Nomaska>	So I wasn't sure if I'd need to compile them myself.
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: in a terminal, type:   apt-cache search role playing game
<CHVNX>	It will return results for everything with role/playing/game
<Nomaska>	So can I use that for everything?
<CHVNX>	Either in the name of the package, its description, or its full information blurb.  If you see a package you would like to know more about, type:  apt-cache show Name_of_package
<CHVNX>	Define "everything" in this context.
<pikaro>	CHVNX, I was actually expecting the pedantry of "programming does mean telling the OS what to do". instead I'll just say I think programming and scripting mean different things in practice
<Nomaska>	Like, if I wanted to find out how to do something. Could I do apt-cache search install
<sauvin>	There is no effective difference between programming and scripting.
<annihilannic>	Nomaska: that would search for packages containing the word "install".  I don't think that's what you want.
<Nomaska>	So apt-cache is for package finding.
<CHVNX>	sauvin: For the sake of arguing semantics, scripting tends to be langauges that do not require compiling./
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: apt-cache searches the package cache.
<CHVNX>	Correct.
<sauvin>	There is no requirement that "programming" involve assembly or compilation.
<pikaro>	CHVNX, thanks, that's what I wanted to say :P
<CHVNX>	The package cache is essentially just a huge list of packages/programs you can install.
<Nomaska>	What runs it after I install it from apt-get?
<pikaro>	sauvin, but in practice, people use the terms like that
<Nomaska>	aut-run?
<Nomaska>	Auto*
*	Roy78 is now known as Forence
<sauvin>	I don't write "scripts" in perl; I write programs.
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: After you install a package, you need to either use your menu/desktop application launcher, or you need to use terminal.  For example, open terminal and type:  firefox.
<CHVNX>	You dont need to open firefox in the terminal, but you can.
<Nomaska>	It gave me an error, lmao.
<Nomaska>	I assume it needs installing.
<CHVNX>	What error?
<Nomaska>	So, I just give terminal the name.
<Nomaska>	Oh, nvm.
<CHVNX>	Doesn't Ubuntu come with firefox?
<Nomaska>	It said something, then ran it.
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: You need to learn how to use something like tab completion.  Inside of a terminal window, type the letter "a" and then press tab a couple of times.
<CHVNX>	What do you see?
<Nomaska>	Nothing.
<pikaro>	nah, Nomaska - it's usually something like "apt-cache find graphics software -> apt-get install gimp -> gimp". sometimes the executable name is different from the package name itself, though - finding that out requires some advanced command line usage, but it'll usually get used to your "star menu" so you can just click it.
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: then you;re doing it worng. Try again.
<Nomaska>	Nothing still, it just adds the tab space.
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: a without a space
<CHVNX>	a<tab><tab>
<Nomaska>	Still adding the space.
<CHVNX>	No space after a.
<pikaro>	(after apt-cache search graphics software, it'll list things that describe themselves as "graphics software" somehow, and one would likely choose gimp to install.)
<Nomaska>	I ran sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng
<Nomaska>	And it did its thing.
<pikaro>	*get added to your start menu, what is it with my brain today...
<Nomaska>	Now do I type aircrack-ng into terminal to run it?
<Nomaska>	Oh.
<Nomaska>	I do.
<Nomaska>	There we go.
<puff>	Nomaska: Also, try "sudo apt-get install aptitude"
<CHVNX>	> never used linux
<CHVNX>	> hacking wifi
<CHVNX>	> troll detected
<puff>	Nomaska: aptitude is an apt-get-ish flavored replacement for apt-get
<CHVNX>	> opens anotehr beer
<pikaro>	hacking wifi with aircrack is a bit unlikely since ten years ago or so...
<Disconsented>	>this is dumb
<CHVNX>	puff: The new hot kid on the block is simply called apt
<Nomaska>	No, someone who cant do these things on Windows, thank you very much.
<pikaro>	unless Nomaska has some serious dedication
<spreeuw>	people still use wifi?
<CHVNX>	spreeuw: only shills and lizards
<Nomaska>	Yes, I do have some dedication.
<puff>	sauvin, CHVNX: Scripting in theory is higher level languages, but the distinction was always fuzzy, even back in the late 80s and early 90s, and these days it's probably meaningless, although the presence of a user-managed compilation step is probaby a key issue in most people's minds (note that many/most "scripting languages" actually do compile, they just do it dynamically).
<Nomaska>	And now I have the resources available to actually start using my dedication.
<sauvin>	puff, "scripting" is generally just "programming" on a smaller scale. The nature of the language translation is irrelevant.
<pikaro>	Nomaska, you'll still need a lot of knowledge to get through WPA, and WPA2 is borderline impossible unless you know the password, if my knowledge is up to date. of course, getting into WEP networks is just fun
<CHVNX>	But not in practice, meaning that is not how people use the term
<puff>	sauvin: Yes to part 1, but not really, and "that's what I just said" to part 2.
<pikaro>	*knowledge and luck
<CHVNX>	When I say I'm scripting something, you can be sure I almost alwasy mean something like a bash/python/perl script instead of "programming" in... python/perl/etc.
<Nomaska>	I have the resources available to learn how to get into a WPA and WPA2 network.
<CHVNX>	It's all about the project, really.
<puff>	Yeah.
<Nomaska>	And I'm starting with a network I already have the password to.
<puff>	I wonder if unixes still come with the "script" command.
<puff>	Hm, apparently they do.
<Nomaska>	I'm going to take control of someones PC on my network.
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: cracking a network you don't need to crack? You eman you're taking the time to learn a skill you probably don't need to learn?  Cool.
<Nomaska>	Then I'll start applying it elsewhere.
<CHVNX>	Nomaska: That can still be illegal, in case you were wondering about the legality of cracking a network.
<Nomaska>	If I don't take the time to learn how to do it on one I already know the password to, how will I do it to someone elses?
<Nomaska>	I know about the legality.
<puff>	Nomaska: And even if it is legal, if you're doing it with the permission of the system owners, etc, make sure you get it in writing from them.
<puff>	Remember what happened to Randal Schwartz!
<puff>	Oh, cool, Randal got it expunged in 2007 (finally!)
<puff>	http://news.cnet.com/2100-7350_3-6164113.html
<pikaro>	Nomaska, there are enough skills to learn inside legal boundaries to become involved in penetration testing, where you can crack security for profit legally. do consider that if you're really interested in the tech side only
<puff>	Though that article oversimplifies and leaves details out.  He was doing the crack with the knowledge of and permission of higher ups at intel.
<Nomaska>	I know, whitehat hacking.
<Nomaska>	Stuff like that.
<CHVNX>	There is no such thing as a white hat.  All hats are grey.
<Nomaska>	Lmfao.
<Nomaska>	You have a point.
<sushemsu>	is there a certification for understanding regular expressions?
<sushemsu>	I wanna get that, that's where the money is
<wh0isthis>	how do i set date in console?
<annihilannic>	Suchorski: Yes, it involves a straight jacket and sedation.
<annihilannic>	wh0isthis: with the 'date' command
<wh0isthis>	annihilannic: something like this -> date 15/05/2015
<wh0isthis>	?
<pikaro>	wh0isthis, 'man date'
<annihilannic>	wh0isthis: no, date --help, syntax is near the top.
<annihilannic>	wh0isthis: (and yes, it's a really weird format)
<CHVNX>	sushemsu: I think the  LPI Linux Certification covers regex.
<CHVNX>	https://www.lpi.org/certification/
<CHVNX>	Check for yourself.
<annihilannic>	sushemsu: which of the eleventeen flavours of RE are you interested in?
<murrdawg>	Ok, so now that I have my ubuntu server up, does anyone have any advice how to automatically download latest episodes of a show?
<CHVNX>	murrdawg: carefully
<dfzxh>	hey guys im using linux
<CHVNX>	dfzxh: Prove it.
<annihilannic>	dfzxh: what a coincidence!!!
<desayuno>	i am not using linux
<murrdawg>	CHVNX: how carefully? I thought to start SABnzbd however I saw I then have to get a pay usenet account. I want to avoid that route
<compdoc>	murrdawg, most shows have websites. and theres youtube
<sauvin>	nzb? You're pirating shows?
<pikaro>	murrdawg, flexget! awesome piece of software. downloads torrents from RSS feeds
<CHVNX>	murrdawg: Learn how to torrent
<murrdawg>	CHVNX: I know how to use torrents on a windows machine... not so much on an Ubuntu server
<murrdawg>	pikaro: thanks, I'll have to look into how to use it
<pikaro>	murrdawg, it's unfortunately really complicated to configure, but don't get discouraged and experiment
<CHVNX>	murrdawg: apt-cache show rtorrent; apt-get install rtorrent; man rtorrent
<CHVNX>	It is not complicated.
<murrdawg>	CHVNX: but I want it to automate with Sick Beard
<CHVNX>	murrdawg: I want to eat strawberries out of Pamala Andersons ass, but that doesn't mean it's going to happen.
<pikaro>	CHVNX, depends on your prerequisites, of course - you'll probably only want it to download _Exactly_ what you want to keep.
<sauvin>	Yup. Piracy. Go away.
<murrdawg>	CHVNX: but it can...
<murrdawg>	sauvin: not necessarily piracy with streaming sites like ABC
<sauvin>	Sick Beard is for downloading stuff as it's posted to usenet?
<CHVNX>	I literally gave you all of the information you need. You have knowledge on your screen.
<pikaro>	sauvin, depends on local laws when concerning TV series
<wh0isthis>	date: cannot set date: Operation not permitted
<wh0isthis>	what is this about?
<Nomaska>	Sudo? :D
<pikaro>	wh0isthis, you don't have administrative privileges - either do "sudo date" or use "su" and then enter root password, depending on your distro
<murrdawg>	pikaro: I installed flexget but I can't seem to use the flexget -V command
<Captonjamason>	so in the past ive had my fare share problems with GRUB but this is insane, when i boot it throws me into the grub command line, i have A: reinstalled grub, Did not work B: Reinstalled it another time, did not help and C: Compleatly got rid of grub and replaced it with LILO and it still puts me into the GRUB command line, this problem has been happening for about a week now and im getting tired of it, im running ubuntu 15
<Captonjamason>	.04 vivid vervet,
<pikaro>	murrdawg, that's... strange? is there any error, or does it just hang? note that it takes ~2sec for me as well.
<Nomaska>	Is it possible to run a program I have on Windows, on my Ubuntu virtualization?
<pikaro>	Nomaska, yes very likely, apt-get install wine
<toothe>	weirdest thing....
<toothe>	my PI doesn't seem to have the wifi work unless I plugin the ethernet
<murrdawg>	pikaro: no command flexget found
<Nomaska>	Windows compatibility layer?
<Nomaska>	Installing it.
<Captonjamason>	toothe: pi's are ethernet only
<Captonjamason>	from what i know of
<CHVNX>	usb wifi
<pikaro>	murrdawg, you sure the installation worked? what distribution are you using?
<CHVNX>	http://elinux.org/RPi_USB_Wi-Fi_Adapters
<CHVNX>	http://raspberrypihq.com/how-to-add-wifi-to-the-raspberry-pi/
<murrdawg>	pikaro: I'm following the instructions here: http://flexget.com/wiki/InstallWizard/Linux/Environment/FlexGet
<Captonjamason>	CHVNX: i meant i barebones pi,
<daspence>	I'm trying to write a script like this:
<daspence>	addgdmx <domain> <server> (which will take the information and then search for domain on server and add certain records to the /var/named files.
<daspence>	can someone point me in the right direction of where to start?
<daspence>	i guess, 1, how can I update or insert new data?
<wh0isthis>	pikaro: No passwd entry for user 'date'
<pikaro>	murrdawg, ah right, it uses pip... pip indicated the installation was successful? if so, try sudo whereis flexget
<wh0isthis>	pikaro: it says "No passwd entry for user 'date'"
<pikaro>	wh0isthis, with "sudo date"?! or did you enter "su date"? that's wrong - su_do_ X means "switch user and do X" and su X means "switch user to X". and there's usually no user called "date".
*	josh is now known as Guest54652
<wh0isthis>	pikaro: date: extra operand `2015'
<pikaro>	wh0isthis, then your syntax for 'date' isn't correct. sorry, can't help you wit that specifically, as said above use 'man date' or 'date --help'. but you probably just want 'sudo apt-get install ntpdate' - ntpdate synchronizes the time to the international time servers.
<andrew39>	i return to you lovely folks with a question i had asked before which still remains unresolved
<andrew39>	xrandr --rotate does not rotate my screen, and i've tried various things throughout the months and none have worked out
<Nomaska>	Pikaro: I downloaded Wine, but it gave me a EULA and I cant accept it.
<wh0isthis>	pikaro: so there is no easy command to set the date to 9 may?
<wh0isthis>	simple command
<andrew39>	reward for whoever figures it out ;)
<pikaro>	wh0isthis, alright, looked it up myself... date 050900002015 sets the date to may 9th, 0:00.
<murrdawg>	pikaro: flexget:
<pikaro>	Nomaska, that's _probably_ from one of the microsoft component wine needs for some things. if you want to use windows software, you unfortunately have to deal with EULAs.
<wh0isthis>	pikaro: date: cannot set date: Operation not permitted
<murrdawg>	pikaro: that's what it shows when I type in sudo whereis flexget
<wh0isthis>	i am using sudo date 050900002015
<pikaro>	murrdawg, then it was never installed
<murrdawg>	pikaro: but I had no errors when installed with pip
<dfzxh>	wow i3 is amazing
<murrdawg>	pikaro: this is what I  get with sudo pip install flexget: http://pastebin.com/CfBi5CZQ
<dfzxh>	never used tiling window managers a day in my life and its already natural

<Nomaska>	Now what?
<Nomaska>	Retry apt-get remove?
<annihilannic>	What I just typed
*	Adiemus is now known as Adiemus|away
<annihilannic>	...should tell you what process is holding the lock.
<Nomaska>	I did ps -fp 4509
<TinFox>	okay, so what did that say?
<SoItBegins>	What the TinFox just said
<Nomaska>	UID root PID 4509 PPID 3933 C 0 STIME 18:42 TTY pts/4 TIME 00:00:04 /usr/bin/dpkg --status-fd 61 --u
<annihilannic>	seems like you do have some kind of package installation/update/removal going on in the background
<Nomaska>	How do I kill it?
<annihilannic>	probably not the best idea to kill it really, how long ago was 18:42?
<Nomaska>	Thirty mins.
<Nomaska>	I need to kill it so I can remove it, and reinstall it.
<annihilannic>	well, 'sudo kill 4509' should do the trick.
<Nomaska>	Thank you.
<TinFox>	then sudo apt-get remove packagename should work
<sushemsu>	sigh sed -n '[0-9],[0-9]p' processes the whole file : /
<annihilannic>	sushemsu: what were you expecting it to do?
<sushemsu>	went to read up to the nth line in the stream and write that out
<Nomaska>	How the hell do I click "okay" on a terminal EULA?
<annihilannic>	Usually just enter or type 'y' or 'yes' or something
<Nomaska>	It wont let me.
<Nomaska>	It say <Ok>
<Nomaska>	Says*
<TinFox>	Nomaska: select with the arrow keys and press enter?
<neonstorm>	press tab to highlight the ok
<TinFox>	oh, tab might work
<annihilannic>	sushemsu: sed -n '1,9p' would do up to line 9
<Nomaska>	Oooooooh.
<Nomaska>	That worked.
<Nomaska>	Thank you.
<neonstorm>	some of the interfaces are weird
<sushemsu>	annihilannic: but it loads the whole file into memory at one point.
<annihilannic>	sushemsu: then you need to tell it to quit at line 10.
<annihilannic>	sushemsu: sed -n '1,9p;9q'    (or line 9, since it has already printed)
<sushemsu>	annihilannic: no kidding, hmm well played
<pikaro>	oh that's what you meant by "can't accept", I thought you objected to the EULA itself
<annihilannic>	sushemsu: or, since printing is default behaviour without -n, just: sed 9q
<dfzxh>	is i3 the future of user interface
<sushemsu>	annihilannic: 1,9 was the example range, I was just using it to find out what a character in a text file I had was, and was lazy and didn't specify to only trace the write call
<sushemsu>	annihilannic: saw redic read spam from the 2 million line file : /
<dfzxh>	does anyone here use their computer without touching the mouse
<SoItBegins>	I do. I has a TRACKPAD!

<zapotah>	i use many computers with keyboard only
<Corey>	dfzxh: From time to time. OS X makes that a bit odd at times.
<annihilannic>	dfzxh: well, it depends how you define 'their computer', this is a Linux VM with only SSH access, so I only use it by keyboard, yes.
<annihilannic>	dfzxh: I don't have X installed on it.
<annihilannic>	dfzxh: But I use tmux as a window manager and it kinda feels like i3 ;-)
<zapotah>	hell i use windows with keyboard _mostly_ besides web browsing
<zapotah>	since web browsing tends to be kinda visual-based
<zapotah>	its just faster that way

<annihilannic>	user_: something like that, yes, but... why are you sending data to wget?  to POST to a web page?

<zacts>	hi
<zacts>	how can I setup a debian chroot for the purpose of running sid alongside jessie?
<zacts>	and launch individual debian sid apps from jessie
<zacts>	(without using the chroot command when launching the apps)
<zacts>	(such as iceweasel)
<dfzxh>	did anyone here used to use a computer with a 40x25 display back in the day
<annihilannic>	dfzxh: yes
<Wamphyri>	dfzxh, commi 128?
<annihilannic>	dfzxh: not very productively though I'll admit ;-)
<dfzxh>	incredible
<zapotah>	dfzxh: im sure plenty of people here did
<dfzxh>	is it something you guys would recommend
<demtrizzle>	hello folks, I have this usb kingston 16GB which contains inside a debian installation. I can't remember the last time I used it because it started to give me errors on boot. Now that I found it again, I plug it in and it gets recognized but it doesn't get a disk device for me to mount it so I can't access it to format it. Here's some relevant info about dmesg, lsusb, lsblk etc: http://sprunge.us/fcKB
<zapotah>	dfzxh: using a 30 years old display tech? no
<ananke>	dfzxh: yes. we'd also recommend using an outhouse instead of indoor plumbing, and black and white tv
<demtrizzle>	what can I try in order to save it if it's repairable
<zapotah>	dfzxh: is there a point to all this?
<dfzxh>	zapotah: no
<user_>	annihilannic, ive solved my probem thanks for trying to help
<dfzxh>	ananke: lol
<zapotah>	dfzxh: then wtf are you doing
<dfzxh>	zapotah: i enjoy retro computing
<zapotah>	right
<dfzxh>	considering buying an old 13" crt monitor
<Wamphyri>	thats not retro, thats called using a microscope to read text
<ananke>	that's not retro, that's just plain dumb
<Wamphyri>	lol
<Wamphyri>	so is what i'm trying to do apperently :p
<user_>	does aplay play sounds from url?
<zapotah>	13" is far from retro
<dfzxh>	what would you guys recommend then
<ananke>	dfzxh: for _what_?
<zapotah>	^
<dfzxh>	general purpose computing
<zapotah>	something from this century?
<ananke>	dfzxh: a modern LCD.
<annihilannic>	dfzxh: getting a whole working retro computer, rather than just using a small display to make it "feel" retro
<Wamphyri>	if you wanna use 40*25 text, set your console window to that size
<zapotah>	^
<dfzxh>	i think you guys are about to save me a lot of money
<triceratux>	dfzxh: im running open cobol v1.1. on slackware http://ur1.ca/kc6v2 now thatz retro ;)
<dfzxh>	triceratux: impressive
<dfzxh>	does anyone actually use cobol for anything
<Wamphyri>	the limitation your goig to encounter with a pc that old is going to frustrate you beyond belief
<zapotah>	ive got a 286 running dos 5.0
<Wamphyri>	lol
<zapotah>	not sure if it still boots though
<dfzxh>	i have two commodore 64's, a macintosh 2, and an IBM PS/2 pc
<fred1807>	I am looking for a irc bot that can return me status information and run some task like reboot on its machine
<zapotah>	dfzxh: is there any point to all this or can i ignore you?
<annihilannic>	dfzxh: I've got an abacus, beat that.
<dfzxh>	zapotah: no point, sorry
<Wamphyri>	using a remote kvm setup is it possible to install centos over debian? or even from ssh?
<dfzxh>	annihilannic: i guess i cant beat that heh
<triceratux>	dfzxh: http://simplicity.laserfiche.com/looking-job-hows-your-cobol/
<ananke>	Wamphyri: boot it to a centos installer
*	JonathanDongle is now known as JonathanD
<Wamphyri>	from within the kvm or ssh?
<jfe>	i don’t see the sense in using old technology, unless the intention is to draw some wisdom from the experience of doing so, and even then i think it’s dubious.
*	jfe dials 911...
<triceratux>	dfzxh: believe me, it didnt used to be something you could learn at home
<ananke>	Wamphyri: ssh has nothing to do with the bootup process. so that clearly leaves kvm
<dfzxh>	jfe: its entertaining. i deal with new technology at work, i like to play with old stuff at home
<Wamphyri>	ok, ananke, do you have a link that could help with the centos-installer through kvm?
<Wamphyri>	i'm been searching but no avail
<dfzxh>	triceratux: what is your experience with cobol?
<ananke>	Wamphyri: insert centos install media. then boot to said media
<triceratux>	dfzxh: thatd be telling :) im just a k&r linux hacker these days
<dfzxh>	triceratux: you're a classic
<Wamphyri>	i'm not talking about kvm virtualization, i'm talking about a collocated server few thousand km's from me lol
<fred1807>	I am looking for a good-not-evil botnet irc
<ananke>	Wamphyri: yes, that was clear right from the beginning.
<toothe>	I'm thinking of getting a chromebook and installing Linux on it
<annihilannic>	fred1807: I think you're looking in the wrong place
<toothe>	and using it as my travel laptop...
<dfzxh>	anyone know off the top of their head what the default path for lynx's configuration file is? in the user directory (~/)
<toothe>	but then I feel ridiculous having a laptop to begin with.
<ananke>	dfzxh: man lynx
<dfzxh>	toothe: i own a chromebook. highly recommend
<dfzxh>	ananke: thanks
<toothe>	dfzxh: Do you run ChromeOS on it?
<toothe>	my only issue is, I really don't want to be associated with Google. I switched to duckduckgo and never login.
<dfzxh>	toothe: sort of, i have ubuntu running in a chroot and use that for everything
<Wamphyri>	ananke please excuse my stupidity, how am i going to insert media then?
<dfzxh>	toothe: ubuntu uses the chrome os drivers so everything works perfectly
<toothe>	dfzxh: IN a Chroot? I don't follow.
<ananke>	Wamphyri: you ask the colocation service to do that for you. not to mention, most likely they offer stuff via pxe
<dfzxh>	toothe: chrome os is actually gentoo linux under the hood. if you enable developer mode you can open a shell and install another linux system in a chroot, and then start X11 from that
<toothe>	i see...
<toothe>	interesting...
<dfzxh>	toothe: so i have chrome os running in the background, doing nothing. my ubuntu chroot is using the chrome os drivers/kernel which supports the hardware very well
<toothe>	i wish it had a better office environment.
<Wamphyri>	nothing is offered via pxe unfortunately and for them to install centos its a 25$ charge
<toothe>	because I Really really wanna buy one of these things for my mom, but she *needs* office
<dfzxh>	who needs office when you've got your buddies awk grep latex and ghostscript
<toothe>	dfzxh: fuck that, go hardcore! Use zip and xml!
<dfzxh>	now you're talking
<toothe>	IN DOS'S DEBUG!

*	gattuso is now known as jukechat
<toothe>	what's the battery life? Its an arm, i believe.
<dfzxh>	toothe: im rocking the Asus C200MA
<dfzxh>	toothe: x86 cpu, 14+ hours of battery life
<Telvana>	Mine is a Celeron, roughly 8 hours a battery life
<toothe>	x86 Cpu...? with 14 hours?
<toothe>	its not an arm?
<dfzxh>	toothe: you bet
<Telvana>	a = of
<toothe>	32 or 64 bit?
<Telvana>	Haswell, ftw.
<dfzxh>	toothe: 64 bit
<ananke>	Wamphyri: then you're SOL. unless you have multiple storage available, such as internal SD card (quite common on enterprise servers)
<dfzxh>	toothe: 2 GB ram. 16 gb ssd

<toothe>	so, i really do use a ton of VMs and such
<dfzxh>	toothe: run em on your desktop and ssh/vnc in
<toothe>	i think next time, I"m going to just get a desktop, not a laptop, and get a cheap chromebook for mobile.
<toothe>	yeah.
<f209>	hey can anyone help me virtualenv keeps complaining about configparser not being an installed package
<Wamphyri>	ananke, i have 2 separate drives on the server
<Telvana>	I use my desktop 90% of the time, I love having 5 monitors. :P
<f209>	when i do a python --version it says 2.7.6
<Telvana>	It's odd using one screen with the chromebook, I keep trying to do too much stuff all at once
<f209>	i know this is some issue because in python3 configparser was renamed
<dfzxh>	Telvana: i recently unplugged my second monitor and now im enjoying the focus i get from only using 1 display. how does that make you feel
<ananke>	f209: #python
<f209>	thanks
<Telvana>	dfzxh: More power to ya, it would drive me nuts
<Remram>	Hmm, sometimes chattr just doesn't seem to want to set attrs
<Remram>	why is that?
<dfzxh>	Telvana: what kind of display adapter do you have that lets you output to 5 displays at once? also what resolutions
<Wamphyri>	crossfire or sli
<ananke>	Wamphyri: you could try dumping the installer iso to said second drive and see if you can boot from it. it's a hybrid iso
<Telvana>	SLI, 2560x1600 on three of them, 1920x1200 on the other two
<ananke>	Remram: we can't comment on the completely unknown scenario.
<dfzxh>	Telvana: WM?
<Telvana>	*cough* Unity
<annihilannic>	Telvana: And how have you physically installed/positioned them so they are all within eyeshot?
<Remram>	ananke: I just create a file, call "chattr +C file", and "lsattr file" shows -----
<dfzxh>	Telvana: ayyyy lmao
<Remram>	I've seen this happen before, although it also works at times
<annihilannic>	Remram: On what type of filesystem?
<ananke>	Remram: check lsattr. honestly, i've never used 'C'. and what's the fs type?
<Telvana>	annihilannic: I use SpaceCo monitor mounts, 3 are at eye level, the other two are above them
<ananke>	doh, you did use lsattr
<Remram>	btrfs. C is "no copy on write"
<Telvana>	The other two monitors pretty much just monitor logs, they don't really need to be looked at constantly
<Remram>	running chattr -C +V file says "Flags of file set as ---------------C" but then lsattr disagrees
<Remram>	wait no, `chattr -V +C` :P
<ananke>	Remram: did you check the manual? :)
<ananke>	"Note: For btrfs, the 'C' flag should be set on new or empty files.  If it is set on a file which already has data blocks, it is undefined when the blocks assigned to  the  file will  be  fully  stable
<Remram>	lol wat
<ananke>	Remram: 'manual'
<Remram>	well that's embarrassing. Indeed, it only works on directory and *empty* files
<Remram>	don't know how I missed that... I'm new to this btrfs business (and Linux at all, in some sense)
<Remram>	thanks ananke
<dfzxh>	does anyone here prefer latex to WYSIWYG editors
<Psi-Jack>	I do not.
<andrew39>	anyone ever have problem rotating their screen?

<SpaceDoG>	Trying to mount a subfolder on an NFS share... I'm getting permission denied by server but if I add vers=3 to fstab it works
<Prelude2004c>	hey everyone.. anyone familiar with ipsec / openswan ?
<wamphyri>	ok so how would i go about dumping the iso?
<ananke>	wamphyri: dd
<oldtopman>	andrew39: Nope.
<Prelude2004c>	http://pastebin.com/Gna2k9Mu  < can someone have a look.. i want to encrypt all traffic that passes through the GRE Tunnel
<andrew39>	oldtopman, what video card driver do you use
<Prelude2004c>	what is wrong with it? ipsec establishes fine but i can't seem to encrypt anything
<pingfloyd>	wamphyri wampa
<oldtopman>	andrew39: Nvidia propietary ones.
<andrew39>	oldtopman, laptop or desktop?
<oldtopman>	Both work.
<andrew39>	do you have a card that has optimus?
<sven86>	i'm having problems with nfs mounting, it keeps on hanging when i try to do it.
<oldtopman>	GT 640, GTX 650ti sc, and Quadro 140M.
<oldtopman>	andrew39: Not to my knowledge, just the cards above.
<andrew39>	i think the problem is with the optimus cards
<oldtopman>	Could very well be.
<wamphyri>	ananke is there a how to?
<dfzxh>	anyone here like to party
<wamphyri>	dfzxh, to old and not enough time
<ananke>	wamphyri: you may be better off paying that $25 fee
<wamphyri>	ananke: well either way if i break the system i'll still have to pay the 25$ so it'll be something new for me to try and learn lol

<Telvana>	Does anyone have any suggestions for weather tracking software? Something that can allow me to see live level 2/3 NOAA radar?
<Rad->	Is anyone experienced in postfix?
<annihilannic>	wamphyri: that doesn't tell us much, how about 'lsblk -f'?
<sven86>	telvana, what about wdssii?
<wamphyri>	http://pastebin.com/F9fkEJKG
<Telvana>	That's an option, yes. I was just wondering if there is anything else out there other than GEMPAK which is just a disaster to setup.
<jnylen>	hmm
<jnylen>	is it worth to upgrade to debian 8?
<sven86>	you could try IDV
<annihilannic>	wamphyri: so it looks like your sdb is completely unused, just dd an iso image on to it and see if you can tweak a new grub entry (assuming you are using grub?) to boot from it.  that way you should always still be able to boot debian again to retry...
<Telvana>	sven86: Another option I was looking at was zygrib, but it looks deprecated.
<wamphyri>	annihil: thank you
<wamphyri>	annihilannic: lets hope for the best
<sven86>	telvana: i'm not familiar with it
<annihilannic>	wamphyri: when you actually install CentOS from that image it will overwrite that grub installation, so if it doesn't boot after that then you've passed the point of no return.
<Telvana>	IDV is looking hopeful.
<wamphyri>	so i dd write the iso to the sdb right?
<wamphyri>	annihilannic: and before i race off doing this should i be doing this in console or kvm?
<wamphyri>	console being ssh
<zoku>	i'm having hell with iwlwifi on 3.16
<zoku>	http://pastebin.com/cBDTn2k7
<zoku>	I suspect it might be my wifi card tho :/
<Telvana>	sven86: hehe, IDV has a bit of a learning curve, but looks very promising so far.
<sven86>	telvana: cool.
<annihilannic>	wamphyri: sorry, I don't know anything about kvm
<annihilannic>	wamphyri: I would do it in the console, treating it as a "normal" system
<sven86>	anybody here familiar with nfs? i'm having mouting issues
<wamphyri>	annihilannic: ok, gonna be fun breaking the system from a few thousand clicks away lol
<dfzxh>	what is the best keyboard for use with linux
<souuell>	sven86: whatkind of mountin g issues
<souuell>	dfzxh: no keyboard.
<annihilannic>	dfzxh: why would any keyboard be any better for linux?  use whatever you like best.
<sven86>	souuell: it hangs when it try to do either a manual or automount
<souuell>	sven86: it should give you an error
<souuell>	sounds like maybe a permissions error tho
<Remram>	Just managed to break my filesystem by doing btrfs snapshots...
<Remram>	glad I tried that on a test filesystem before using this on actual data
<sven86>	souuell: showmount -e xxx.xxx.x.x gives me this: rpc mount export: RPC: Timed out
<Remram>	"btrfs-transacti tainted" isn't btrfs stable?
<souuell>	sven86: do you have rpc / portmapper running sven86 ?
<sven86>	yes
<souuell>	you sure?
<sven86>	portmapper shows up on rpcinfo -p
<souuell>	sven86: how sure are you that portmapper is running?
<sven86>	how can i find out? i'm using mythbunut (ubuntu)
<jdahm>	I've found a file, or I think it's one with the name "~" inside "~/Mail/" that seems to link back to /home/jdahm. "type \~" returns "type: ~: not found" and "unlink \~" says it can't unlink it. The permissions seems to be 700. Is it safe to delete it?
<souuell>	sven86: ps aux |grep -i 'portmap\|rpc'
<jdahm>	oh nevermind, I figured it out. it's a weird file put there by mbsync
<sven86>	souuell: http://paste.linuxassist.net/view/25fe2d09
<souuell>	sven86: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo
<deego>	How does mint show me this upon login? "0 packages can be updated. 0 updates are security updates." How do I configure debian to do the same?
<souuell>	deego: by installling mint
<deego>	anyone else?
<souuell>	yeah, by installing mint.
<sven86>	souuell: okay, where to start?
<souuell>	sven86: by reading
<sven86>	where? I read this many times, and I'm still confused
<souuell>	also sven86, https://help.ubuntu.com/14.04/serverguide/network-file-system.html
<wamphyri>	annihilannic still around?
<sven86>	souuell: yeah, read that one
<annihilannic>	wamphyri: allegedly
<Psi-Jack>	annihilannic: The verdict is in. GUILTY!
<Remram>	it seems that calling btrfs subvolume snapshot with an invalid argument to -i f***s up the filesystem and remounts it readonly with the error state set
<Remram>	aborted transaction, errno=-22 unknown
<Remram>	that looks REALLY DANGEROUS
<Psi-Jack>	Well, report the bug. And welcome to experimental.
<wamphyri>	lol
<Remram>	btrfs is experimental?
<Psi-Jack>	Uhh, D'uh.
<wamphyri>	annihilannic: only be here if you wanna be ;)
<Psi-Jack>	Remram: https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/FAQ#Is_btrfs_stable.3F
<Remram>	I thought it was stable as of Linux 3.10
<Psi-Jack>	It is not.
<wamphyri>	annihilannic: ok i created the sdb downloaded the iso for centos and dd wrote it to /dev/sdb
<sven86>	thanks fro your help
<annihilannic>	wamphyri: what exactly do you mean by 'created the sdb'?
<wamphyri>	fdisked it
<wamphyri>	there was nothing on it beside "free space"
<annihilannic>	wamphyri: ok, well, that was pointless since dd-ing an image over the top of it just wiped what you did.  :-)  but, you don't need to anyway.
<wamphyri>	annihilannic: well i was testing age long skills i guess lmao
<wamphyri>	annihilannic: so what would be my next step
<annihilannic>	wamphyri: well, does your existing system use grub?
<wamphyri>	annihilannic: debian 7.8, pretty sure it does
<Remram>	Psi-Jack: alright I compiled a nice test case/log, where do you think I can report this/check if it is known?
<Psi-Jack>	Remram: Same page, near the top "I have a problem with my btrfs filesystem!" section.
<annihilannic>	wamphyri: modify your grub config, add a new entry to boot off /dev/sdb.  i don't know exactly what you'll need here, may involve some r-ing tfm.
<wamphyri>	annihilannic: ok, i have been trying to find different how tos to help besides pestering you :) i like to pretend i'm old school and use google as my friend
<wamphyri>	lol
<annihilannic>	wamphyri: doubt you'll find howtos for installing in such a convoluted way - it'd hardly be the recommended approach, but you set yourself a challenge
<Remram>	Psi-Jack: this is very hard to navigate, I really don't know if this bug is known
<wamphyri>	annihilannic: well first distro i have ever used was debian 1.2 :p
<wamphyri>	then played with slack 3.1/3.2
<Psi-Jack>	Heh
<Psi-Jack>	Bugzilla is a PITA IMHO.
<Remram>	from the wiki, I don't even know if I should open a ticket or post to the list
<Remram>	opening a ticket requires an account, I guess I'm posting to the list
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<wamphyri>	annihilannic: will grub2 be fine as well?
<Psi-Jack>	And there we go. All my VM's have appropriate roles setup for them... Now all they need is appropriate cookbooks to fill those roles. LOL
<Psi-Jack>	But that comes after I finish my base system cookbook(s).
<Remram>	is there a stable filesystem that supports snapshotting? :s
<annihilannic>	wamphyri: well, any bootloader should be fine.
<beepie>	Remram, snapshotting?
<Psi-Jack>	Remram: ZFS, but 3rd party only, never native to the kernel.
<Psi-Jack>	And also, in linux, still experimental technically. So, I guess... No.
<Remram>	Windows have had it for a while, I thought it was a common thing
<Psi-Jack>	Remram: Alternative, Ceph can do snappshotting, but that requires 3 servers. :)
<Psi-Jack>	Windows /Server/ has something to that regards, but you have to pay lots of money for that "feature"
<Psi-Jack>	And of course, it only works on network volumes, not local. :)
<beepie>	Remram, btrfs snapshotting has been usable for awhile but i know there's problems when the disk gets full
<Psi-Jack>	And, he said: Stable.
<Psi-Jack>	btrfs != stable
<beepie>	btrfs has been stable for awhile.. but i can't say for sure about snapshotting, he should consult the latest changes with it ( https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page)
<Psi-Jack>	Oh, there's also LVM which does snapshotting.
<Psi-Jack>	beepie: https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/FAQ#Is_btrfs_stable.3F
<Psi-Jack>	That says you are wrong, Sir.
<beepie>	that page is outdated..

<Psi-Jack>	It claims otherwise.
*	Julian is now known as Guest32280
<beepie>	well jack, you should be wondering why Google employees are advocating it is usable -- furthermore distros (opensuse) and others offer btrfs with their installer.
<Psi-Jack>	Just because it /appears/ stable, doesn;t make it stable. It's clearly still experimental, and will exhibit some problems, as Remram has just recently pointed out.
<beepie>	However, I can't say for sure how good snapshotting is.  But I know there is "snapper" for helping making snapshots with btrfs
<Psi-Jack>	Google does a lot of fracking crazy stupid ideas.
<Psi-Jack>	And opensuse pushes the envelope heavily sometimes, as Red Hat Software once did.
<annihilannic>	wamphyri: having said that, here is something that talks about what you're trying to do: http://www.howtogeek.com/196933/how-to-boot-linux-iso-images-directly-from-your-hard-drive/
<Psi-Jack>	Again, officially, it's not considered stable.
<Psi-Jack>	Simple as that. :)
<beepie>	I'm talking only about what I know.
<Psi-Jack>	Either way. Ta ta.. Off to slumber. :)
<triceratux>	beepie: btrfs is an oracle/facebook thing. opensuse is being used as a testbed & so is google, as theyre in a position to recover readily http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2336904/facebook-will-trial-btrfs-linux-file-system-in-its-data-centres
<triceratux>	"Btrfs is still under heavy development and therefore is not yet considered stable."
<beepie>	triceratux, google is behind btrfs development as well.
<beepie>	triceratux, maybe you should google. :)
<Froolap>	google is behind the times.

<triceratux>	beepie: its essentially the gotchas as of 2015apr "Why doesn't everybody use BTRFS? Some people have experienced problems that resulted in data loss (though not too recently).

<Remram>	anyway, sent my log as http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.btrfs/45039
<triceratux>	beepie: thats my line :)
<Rad->	If youre using postfix, can you OMIT mydestination?
<Remram>	I'm guessing the official correct way to use Linux is to put ext4 on LVM
<Remram>	and rely on LVM for the snapshotting
<Psi-Jack>	Remram: "shadow copies" is a completely entirely different thing. Allowing you to copy the data of a live-running normally locked file.
<Psi-Jack>	That's not a snapshot.
<Remram>	It is
<Psi-Jack>	Not in the same sense as you're talking about, snapshotting filesystems.
<Remram>	I don't know where you're getting that from
<Psi-Jack>	Knowledge.
<Psi-Jack>	Rad-: Why would you want to omit that?
<Remram>	My knowledge is sourceable: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc785914(WS.10).aspx
<Remram>	I have no idea where your comes from
<Psi-Jack>	Remram: That literally says EXACTLY what I just said. in more words. :p
<Remram>	we're not seeing the same words then
<Remram>	"consistent point-in-time copies of data" are snapshots
<Psi-Jack>	And note: Windows Server. :p
<Rad->	Psi-Jack: well let's pretend my hosted domain is "hello.com". me@hello.com is my current email. However, I want to forward, say, you@hello.com to you@gmail.com and that seems to only work with virtual domains. Furthermore, postfix docs say never to use a virtualdomain as your destination?
<rumpel>	also: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Copy
<Remram>	I've been using it on my laptop for 2 years, I know it's available there, and I know it's a snapshot
<rumpel>	"The aim of Shadow Copy is to create consistent reliable snapshots. "
<Remram>	This is ##linux, nobody will think less of you for being wrong about some obscure Windows feature. But you're wrong
<Psi-Jack>	Well, I suppose I know what shadow copies in Windows land used to be. It may have advanced more since then. ;)
<Remram>	the only way to do backups if you can't snapshot is to completely stop using the filesystem while you snapshot... it's not great
<bullgard4>	Thinkpad T43 Debian-8 started into an Emergency mode. '# journalctl -xb' reports: "kernel: ata1.00: execption Emask 0x0 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x0 action 0x6 frozen." Does »execption« mean here: "An exception error occurred"?
<Psi-Jack>	Yeah, I know, I do snapshots on my virtual machines all the time. :)
<Psi-Jack>	Thankfully, qcow2 and lvm can do that, live. :)
<Remram>	I actually installed LVM first, but then I read about all the crazy stories about rescuing broken LVM partitions and I thought I'd better move away from that
<Remram>	btrfs looked good but I didn't expect it to actually crash
<Psi-Jack>	LVM is awesome, and very reliable.
*	metaspike doesnt even use partitions, lol
<Rad->	Psi-Jack: OR is there a way to stop people from sending email to mydestination?
<Remram>	but btrfs subvolumes share a single pool, so I don't have to resize my FS to account for usage
<diegoviola>	metaspike: what do you mean you don't use partitions?
<metaspike>	well, at home anyway... i just write the filesystem directly to the block device
<metaspike>	it confuses the hell out of gparted but nvm
<metaspike>	i like it
<Remram>	to the disk device you mean?
<metaspike>	yeah
<Remram>	I'd do that for VMs, sure, but for actual systems?
<metaspike>	normally gparted or the user will ext3fs /dev/sda1 or whatever i go straight for the /dev/sda
<Psi-Jack>	Rad-: What is your actual goal, exactly?
<Rad->	Check all my email from example.com on rainloop, but forward one email from example.com NOT to a user mail thingus
<pingfloyd>	Remram: were those "crazy stories" by people who actually used LVM?
<Psi-Jack>	...
<Psi-Jack>	Nevermind.
<Rad->	er
<Rad->	sorry
<Psi-Jack>	Sorry I asked. :p
<Remram>	pingfloyd: if you break your LVM somehow, how do you recover data?
<Remram>	apparently, you don't
<Remram>	that's scary to me
<Rad->	Probably in more techincal speak (sorry for sleepiness): I want to forward an email address on my hosted domain to another destination, say, gmail.com
<Psi-Jack>	LVM hardly ever breaks, and if it does, it's usually user error.
<Rad->	does that make more sense Psi-Jack XD
<pingfloyd>	Remram: what do you think happens if you break your file system?
<pingfloyd>	I run LVM over luks and never have problems
<pingfloyd>	that would be "pushing luck" further.  Especially encryption.
<Psi-Jack>	I've been using LVM for... Well, almost as long as LVM has been around, and never had issues.
<pingfloyd>	but that's why you backup the important stuff
<Psi-Jack>	Even when that... Oh what was it. EV-something-something, enterprise level LVM thing that was around for a bit.
<Psi-Jack>	EVMS?
<pingfloyd>	something like that, I never bothers with that logical volume management scheme
<pingfloyd>	*bothered
<Remram>	should I just get rid of my btrfs and put ext2 on LVM?
<Remram>	I guess if I'm scared of using snapshots, there's really no point
<Psi-Jack>	Well, keep one thing understood, for LVM snapshots to work, you have to have your volume with data, and the free volume space for your snapshots.
<bullgard4>	Thinkpad T43 Debian-8 started into an Emergency mode. '# journalctl -xb' reports: "kernel: ata1.00: execption Emask 0x0 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x0 action 0x6 frozen." Does »execption« mean here: "An exception error occurred"?
<Psi-Jack>	That's how LVM snapshots work is it makes a new LV with the snapshot you can mount. :)
<Remram>	yeah that's why LVM is so annoying
<Remram>	you've got to manually size everything
<Remram>	btrfs keeps subvolumes/snapshots/... in one partition and I don't care about anything but the whole partition getting full
<Psi-Jack>	Yeah, ceph you just make a .snap/snapshotname directory, and BOOM! Instant snapshot at that point in time.
<Remram>	LVM snapshots will just break (silently) if I change the original volume too much
<Abbott>	to route all of my traffic through my server (and not just a few ports) I would need to set up my server as a VPN, right? Or is there a way to forward all of my traffic through my server using SSH and PuTTY?
<Psi-Jack>	VPN, would be more appropriate.
<rumpel>	Abbott, google a tutorial for ssh SOCKS proxy
<Psi-Jack>	SSH != router. :p
<Psi-Jack>	And ssh socks... Isn't so reliable.
<Abbott>	Psi-Jack do you have a package you would recommend to set up a VPN? I'm on Debian FWIW
<Psi-Jack>	OpenVPN
<Abbott>	thanks, Psi-Jack. I'll look into it now
<TheoMurpse>	Hi. I'm running Arch Linux, which has systemctl/systemd on it. It's booting off a USB thumb drive and is headless. I can no longer SSH into it, and the router does not indicate it's connected. However, I can plug the USB drive into another computer and read the files. Is there some log/journal I should read to view what's happening on the boot? The device's LEDs are indicating it's up and running. I just can't SSH in. The only thi
<TheoMurpse>	ng I did was edit fstab, but I reverted that and it still won't boot.
<Psi-Jack>	TheoMurpse: You could.. Plug a monitor into it, and check it literally in the specific host it's having issues on.
<TheoMurpse>	Psi-Jack, there is no monitor out
<Psi-Jack>	What kind of computer is that garbage?
<TheoMurpse>	This is an embedded system. Think wrt54g (it's actually a pogo plug), so no video out on the entire device. I must SSH in or Telnet in.
*	Psi-Jack abstainss.
<[R]>	TheoMurpse: sounds like you need to hook up a serial port to it
<TheoMurpse>	No serial port.
<Psi-Jack>	Heh, such a worthless device. :p
<TheoMurpse>	It was $20 brand new
<[R]>	every pogo i've seen has one...
<[R]>	even my crappy one does
<TheoMurpse>	and it's been hosting my personal video server and a ton of other stuff fine for a coupl eyears now
<TheoMurpse>	almost no power consumption
<TheoMurpse>	But I did read the system.journal. If you'd like to take a look and let me know what you think, http://i.imgur.com/VrwvNaA.png
<TheoMurpse>	had to screenshot because my LInux box reading the USB is not supporting clipboard sharing w/host device right now
<TheoMurpse>	I just tried to boot it up a couple minutes ago, so the fact that system.journal's last entries are on May 8 concern me.
<[R]>	which is why anyone screwing around with crappy embedded devices need to solder a serial port to it
<[R]>	always the first thig i do
<pandoxer>	How do I find and report every line of text files that match this regex "pandoxer(.*)imgur"?
<pandoxer>	grep -rnw '.' -e "pandoxer(.*)imgur" doens't seem to work
<[R]>	get rid of the ()
<TheoMurpse>	Thanks for the helpful comments.
<TheoMurpse>	Oh well, if no one knows about systemd, i guess I'm glad I have an auto-backup to another drive of the entire system that runs at 4am every day, so I can just restore from there.
<TheoMurpse>	[R] out of curiosity, what would I do if I had a serial port
<[R]>	you'd see what was screwing up when it boots
<TheoMurpse>	So the computer spits out everything to the serial port that it'd spit out to the screen on a non-headless device?
<[R]>	the same rason Psi-Jack saaid to hook up a monitor
<[R]>	as long as you dindt scre up the kernel
<Psi-Jack>	And I know a lot about systemd. :p
<TheoMurpse>	Psi-Jack, great, so if you check out http://i.imgur.com/VrwvNaA.png is there anything you see there in systemd that might indicate that it's booting successfully, or failing at a certain thing?
<Psi-Jack>	I just won't help you.
<TheoMurpse>	Oh OK, preesh
<xsi>	is there a stop barking program?
<xsi>	like NoBark
<TheoMurpse>	verbal taunting is so fun, thanks guys, [R] at least thanks for telling me about the serial port, I guess I'll learn how to solder and attach one in case this knowledge comes in handy the next time I use an embedded device and it fails and I don't keep regular backups.
<cimsoc>	My relationships are insane. I was just accused of using Linux "because it's harder for her to snoop on me"
<[R]>	cimsoc: well isn't taht wahy?
<[R]>	lol
<cimsoc>	No way lol
<[R]>	you're supposed to say "Sure, but shes not supposed to know that"
<nevodka>	linux is always putting a strain on my relationships
<cimsoc>	She's an actuary too, so I started dating her assuming she would be more logical than the average human.
<cimsoc>	nevodka: haha
<[R]>	i had a gf make me a little penguin thing once
<cimsoc>	That's pretty thoughtful
<nevodka>	whenever anyone asks me for help with their computer i give them a fresh install of gentoo
<nevodka>	then they get angry
<nevodka>	normies right :\
<[R]>	she was very nice
<[R]>	nevodka: on this one tv show, they call non special people "normos"
<dfzxh>	anyone use console based web browsers instead of firefox etc
<[R]>	dfzxh: do you have an ACTUAL question?
<dfzxh>	[R]: of course not
<dfzxh>	[R]: i just want to hear what they would recommend
<cimsoc>	I've only ever used lynx
<[R]>	links2
<dfzxh>	im using lynx right now, im enjoying the colors
<[R]>	dfzxh: you could just ask "what is a console web browser"...
<dfzxh>	[R]: why do you like links2
<cimsoc>	I'm not sure I enjoyed any aspect of it, tbh
<[R]>	why not?
<neonrooster>	I'm bored. Is there any C networking library for Linux?
<[R]>	neonrooster: nope
<[R]>	neonrooster: you gotta do it all in asm
<dfzxh>	neonrooster: sorry no networking support in linux yet
<rumpel>	lol
<neonrooster>	ANGRY
<neonrooster>	you must be joking!
<rumpel>	we don't need that \o/
<rumpel>	networking is so 2010
<[R]>	neonrooster: why would we joke about such a thing?
<neonrooster>	[R], *sigh* on to Haiku
<[R]>	bye
<neonrooster>	I'm new to programming and only have Linux. What do I read or do to learn programming?
<[R]>	this isn't #programminghelp
<neonrooster>	ok, then on to friendly-coders . Bye
<[R]>	lol
<rumpel>	neonrooster, it's not only linux ... it's thank-god-it's-linux
<neonrooster>	rumpel, I'd give you a waffle if you proved it
<Aldebaran>	Guys nmap can check ftp on anonymity?
<rumpel>	neonrooster, proofs are for mathematicians
<rumpel>	neonrooster, seriously: you need a library? look it up in package manager, install it, continue programming... very convenient.
<neonrooster>	ok thanks, bye
<[R]>	Aldebaran: i'm sure if it can it's in the man page
<sauvin>	[R], I see you doing that one more time, you're taking a vacation from this channel.
<Aldebaran>	I bed read on eng :(
<Aldebaran>	help pls
<Psi-Jack>	Doing what, exactly, sauvin? Referring some vague question to a manual?
<Psi-Jack>	I see no problem with that.
<sauvin>	Questions about what's needed to begin learning to program on Linux are very much on topic.
<sauvin>	This is NOT an RTFM channel.
<rumpel>	 /topic
<sauvin>	If you can't or don't want to help, shut the hell up.
<Psi-Jack>	nmap is not exactly basic stuf.f :p
<bullgard4>	Thinkpad T43 Debian-8 started into an Emergency mode. '# journalctl -xb' reports: "kernel: ata1.00: execption Emask 0x0 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x0 action 0x6 frozen." What does mean Emask" here?
<SoItBegins>	Error Mask.
<TheoMurpse>	sauvin, thanks. I was also told by someone he didn't want to help me despite knowing a lot about the topic in question.
<sauvin>	Lots of times I could help, too, but very often am distracted, tired or just plain too grumpy to bother.
<TheoMurpse>	sauvin, yeah, that's my approach in domains I'm an expert in. Linux ain't one of them, though!
<bullgard4>	SoltBegins: Thank you.
<Remram>	Linux is the best for any kind of programming, unless you're using .NET or some proprietary BS
<LMNOP>	sometiems im mad, pissed of and its usually because of windoze..
<neonrooster>	demons are attacking me
<sauvin>	neonrooster, one of the things that attracted me to Linux (coming from a DOS/Windows background) was the huge choice of programming language easily available.
<sauvin>	What kind of programming would you like to get into?
<neonrooster>	sauvin, one of the things that attracted me to Linux was free software that was cool
<neonrooster>	but I'll tell you I'd like to try Java and Haskell
<sauvin>	Eep!
<neonrooster>	Stop it you silly System 7
<sauvin>	Java is OOP, and a paradigm shift for somebody with a (long distant) C background, but Haskell is from some other universe.
<neonrooster>	I want something from another universe meep meep
<neonrooster>	sauvin, I want to write a package manager in Haskell
<sauvin>	That's probably doable; I believe there are Haskell channels on Freenode that can help.
<neonrooster>	but I want Linux to be installed in /Packages because ItsMyOwnGoboLinux
<sauvin>	Um... huh?
<neonrooster>	I want to make my own GoboLinux
<Psi-Jack>	Yeah.. Um.. What?
<GPenguin>	neonrooster: grab the LFS book and do it
<neonrooster>	GPenguin, but it needs a package manager and I don't know C, Java, or Haskell (i'm new to programming)
<GPenguin>	there are package managers to choose from
<GPenguin>	look at the ALFS project
<neonrooster>	ok thanks
<GPenguin>	or BLFS
<sauvin>	Also, you can write a package manager in almost any language.
<neonrooster>	but how do I learn how to make my own Gobo Linux because its special
*	sauvin will cheerfully admit he has no clue what a Gobo Linux is
<neonrooster>	or do I try and just port Gobo Linux to x86_64?
<neonrooster>	http://www.gobolinux.org/
<eku1z>	hello
<eku1z>	wow im a noob, took me a good ten minutes to register my nick
<malaprop>	neonrooster: Interesting idea
<neonrooster>	if we could work together to port Gobo Linux to amd64
<neonrooster>	and freshen up the packages, besides. What can't we do if we all work together?
<malaprop>	neonrooster: Wouldn't that design require a lot of housekeeping to deal with libraries being all over the place?
<neonrooster>	malaprop, possibly, I'm new to GoboLinux but I liked the idea that programs go under /Programs and /System is /etc
<malaprop>	neonrooster: Since there's no dedicated lib...
<LMNOP>	!heiarchy
<neonrooster>	maybe I can download GoboLinux and let us take a look at its filesystem hierarchy
<sauvin>	That kind of hierarchy is one of the reasons I won't go back to Windows.
<LMNOP>	!hierarchy
<malaprop>	sauvin: It does seem Windows-like, judging by the Wikipedia summary
<neonrooster>	how could I use the filesystem to keep track of packages? that's all I want
<neonrooster>	each piece of software goes in e.g. kdelibs/5.1.0/
<LMNOP>	just customize makefile
<malaprop>	neonrooster: That seems less intuitive to me than keeping libraries in one place, executables in another, etc.
<pingfloyd>	their hierarchy is terrible
<recognosco>	weirdly very windows like
<pingfloyd>	it works against the grain to downgrade the hierarchy
<malaprop>	Hmm, Gobo symlinks all of their special directories to things like /etc, /usr/bin, /var...
<malaprop>	What could go wrong!
<pingfloyd>	everything
<malaprop>	indeed
*	sauvin loses his appetite
<neonrooster>	ok then I guess I just make it standard FHS hierarchy and make it so that the package manager just uses /var/db/kdelibs-5.1.0/PKGFILES to store files belonging to kdelibs 5.1.0 and PKGINFO to store metadata about the packages
<neonrooster>	OR OOOH I could use xattrs to tag stuff!
<neonrooster>	BeFS YES
<neonrooster>	just like Haiku OS lol
<neonrooster>	here you go: https://www.haiku-os.org/
<malaprop>	Oh, BeOS-based
<malaprop>	That's interesting
<neonrooster>	what if I could make my own Linux like BeOS?
*	ChanServ gives channel operator status to eir
<neonrooster>	with a wayland compositor that clones QNX Neutrino's Photon
<recognosco>	makefiles/packages (deb, rpm etc.) *DOES* keep track of files, then what's the point to Gobo?
*	eir removes ban on *!*@*656-1-226-181.w2-14.abo.wanadoo.fr$##fix_your_connection
*	eir removes channel operator status from eir
<neonrooster>	I'd love to make this: QNX Neutrino based GUI platform that hides windows so that only the administrator can see certain hidden workspaces
<sauvin>	"hides windows"?
<neonrooster>	yes, hides windows
<toothe>	weird question - is there any way to have my keyboard/monitor in one room, but have the computer in another but still be in "real time"
<toothe>	ie, rather than using a cable, use some kinda wireless?
<pingfloyd>	do you need to hide windows?
<neonrooster>	so that you have to type a password to hide windows
<neonrooster>	no
<pingfloyd>	if you do, sounds like you might have a bigger issue
<toothe>	i would like to have the physical computer in the basement, but the keyboard/etc in my room.
<AppAraat>	sauvin: that hierarchy is exactly what confused me the most initially, and admittedly confuses me to this day as well (/usr/bin? /usr/share/bin? /usr/local/bin? etc.)
<neonrooster>	but I'd like to have the ability to do so
<AppAraat>	sauvin: I can understand the difference between /bin and /sbin, but apart from that...
<recognosco>	toothe: wireless keyboards/mouse sometimes has like a 30ft range
<sauvin>	I have a suspicion that "hiding windows", if I understand you properly, would happen at the X level.
<pingfloyd>	AppAraat: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard
<malaprop>	AppAraat: Things have become complicated since 1970
<toothe>	recognosco: and monitor?
<Froolap>	toothe I think you would need a second computer to do desktop sharing but you could probably do it with a pi.
<pingfloyd>	AppAraat: this too http://www.pathname.com/fhs/
<toothe>	id like to be able to play a game or two.
<recognosco>	toothe: wireless HDMI? the range isn't that good though
<pingfloyd>	follow that and you'll be fine
<toothe>	okay, fair.
<malaprop>	pingfloyd: It would be interesting to see someone try to redesign that
<eku1z>	run a long hdmi cable? :D
<malaprop>	pingfloyd: Along sane lines
<eku1z>	how far apart are the rooms?
<recognosco>	http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-wireless-hdmi-video-transmitter/
<malaprop>	pingfloyd: e.g., how many */bin dirs do we actually need?
<Froolap>	as for playing games, the framerate seems to be an issue for a lot of games and anything that adds to that layer may make the game unplayable.
<recognosco>	this one says 100 feet
<pingfloyd>	making every application an island in hierarchy is not one of the sane lines
<malaprop>	pingfloyd: No indeed
<pingfloyd>	it needlessly makes administrating more of a pita
<eku1z>	Check out steam streaming.. I just installed Ubuntu yesterday and and streaming my games from my Windows PC in another room to my linux desktop
<AppAraat>	pingfloyd: so what exactly is the difference between /usr/bin/ and /usr/local/bin/? Also what defines "essential" vs "non-essential" ?
<pingfloyd>	AppAraat: /usr/local/bin is intended for binaries compiled outside the distribution
<pingfloyd>	AppAraat: that link tells what they are for
<sauvin>	malaprop, I use /usr/local/bin for stuff that *I* build, to keep it separate from stuff that Debian installs when I use apt-get.
<pingfloyd>	http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html#USRLOCALLOCALHIERARCHY
<sauvin>	That way, if I do something bone-headed (which is almost guaranteed), I can just zap it without worrying about corrupting something the system needs.
<malaprop>	sauvin: Interesting
<AppAraat>	so if you compile something, it is recommended to put the binaries into /usr/local* ?
<sauvin>	AppAraat, it's what I do.
<LMNOP>	just customize makefile
<LMNOP>	makeing this way more harder
<malaprop>	sauvin: Users' ~ dir used to be in /usr, as I understand it. Which makes /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin more logical
<pingfloyd>	AppAraat: when you compile something yourself use /usr/local as the prefix
<pingfloyd>	if you want it available to all users
<pingfloyd>	you can opt to use some prefix within your home directory if you just want it for 1 user
<nyuszika7h>	AppAraat: even better is to use something like GNU stow to manage /usr/local, because not all programs come with a "make uninstall"
<pingfloyd>	apps that put all their crap in one hierarchy I usually put under /opt
<nyuszika7h>	with stow, you install to prefix /usr/local/stow/foobar and then cd /usr/local/stow; sudo stow foobar
<pingfloyd>	that's why I use checkinstall instead
<pingfloyd>	checkinstall > make install
<eku1z>	How long do you guys think using Linux every day would take to become good enough to be able to start being a sysadmin
<AppAraat>	checkinstall is Debian specific right?
<pingfloyd>	eku1z: depends on the individual
<AppAraat>	eku1z: All I can say is: Beware, dragons ahead.
<pingfloyd>	not everyone has the same level of aptitude
<nyuszika7h>	I never really got checkinstall working so I can't really comment on that
<eku1z>	Ahahaha, Yeah I know... just a general question.. Depends on the individual..
<malaprop>	ekulz: How much Linux does it take to learn not to abuse power?
<nyuszika7h>	it's definitely better to install things as packages if you can, though
<eku1z>	I'm a Windows Server Consultant/Sys Admin so like to think I shouldn't take too long
<sauvin>	I can remember user home directory tree being under /usr, but don't remember which distro(s) that was, and I was very damned happy to see it go AWAY.
<AppAraat>	I know a guy who was determined to become a sysadmin, haven't spoken to him physically for over a year now. Pretty sure he hasn't come out of his house during that period as well.
<K1773R>	ewww
<pingfloyd>	eku1z: it can, you will have to unlearn many bad habits now
<MetaNova>	sauvin: sounds like BSD
<sauvin>	BSD would be so retarded? I disbelieve.
<eku1z>	Alright, i'll be back once I have a beard and jandals
<LMNOP>	how long take to be windoze server
<pingfloyd>	sauvin: sounds like something SCO would have done
<MetaNova>	well the only system I used with home directories under /usr was a BSD system
<MetaNova>	so ..
<eku1z>	6 months, confident after a yr easily
<LMNOP>	not much it do so yea..
<AppAraat>	pingfloyd & nyuszika7h if I can install for 1 user only (and do so without root privs) then that sounds terrific.
<AppAraat>	s/install/compile
<nyuszika7h>	you can install to your home directory yes
<LMNOP>	pretty ez
<pingfloyd>	AppAraat: in some case you don't have to run make install, you can simple just run from its source directory
<nyuszika7h>	I recommend installing to prefix $HOME/.local rather than just $HOME
<malaprop>	AppAraat: If the makefile listens to PKGDIR, it should be fine
<recognosco>	seems like it _was_ BSD that had /usr/home. interesting.
<pingfloyd>	and that works great for something that gets updated a lot and only needed for a single user
<nyuszika7h>	you could also use stow to manage installed things in your home directory
<K1773R>	AppAraat: there is usually PREFIX which you can set to something else
<AppAraat>	but if I want to test that application as a different user... Perhaps I can inherit the previous user's environment. Hmm...
<AppAraat>	K1773R: at what point of the compile process can I specify that?
<malaprop>	recognosco: Kernighan and Pike assumed home dirs were /usr/you, /usr/me
<malaprop>	recognosco: In The Unix Prog. Environment
<MetaNova>	AppAraat: at the ./configure state
<pingfloyd>	a lot of the apps I have a git repo of, I just create symlinks in ~/bin that point to their executables
<MetaNova>	stage*
<K1773R>	AppAraat: usually ./configure
<AppAraat>	ah ok, thanks.
<K1773R>	AppAraat: ie, ./configure --prefix=/opt/yourtoolxy
<MetaNova>	AppAraat: something like ./configure --prefix=/some/place
<pingfloyd>	and ~/bin is in that user's PATH
<neonrooster>	I stole neonrooster's body and I work for the NSA. Do you think you can arrest me?
<MetaNova>	AppAraat: check ./configure --help for full details
<nyuszika7h>	~/.local/bin is better IMO, doesn't clutter your home directory with bin, lib, share, etc.
<malaprop>	neonrooster: Who arrests NSA agents??
<nyuszika7h>	it's also a standard
<pingfloyd>	nyuszika7h: more typing though
<recognosco>	malaprop: i wonder why Kernighan's assumption didn't become the defacto standard
<AppAraat>	nyuszika7h: I'll keep that in mind. I also want to start using ~/bin as a place for random handy scripts, I've understood that Debian/Ubuntu uses that place as a part of $PATH.
<pingfloyd>	recognosco: what assumption?
<pingfloyd>	AppAraat: that's where I keep my custom scripts
<recognosco>	pingfloyd: "malaprop> recognosco: Kernighan and Pike assumed home dirs were /usr/you, /usr/me"
<pingfloyd>	AppAraat: the symlinks I described earlier and my bash scripts
<pingfloyd>	recognosco: I hate that choice in home directory
<pingfloyd>	who in their right mind want's user's directories under the /usr hierarchy
<malaprop>	pingfloyd: /usr meant something different in those days
<AppAraat>	hmm that symlinking in ~/bin seems like a pretty handy approach
<pingfloyd>	it's because of decisions like that, that the FHS was written
<neonrooster>	I'm going to steal all the tiberium and be god over everyone.
<pingfloyd>	AppAraat: then use the /usr/local/ hierarchy for stuff you want available system-wide
<AppAraat>	pingfloyd: but if I understand correctly, that's only for the binaries, the libraries and such are intended to be shared, right?
<pingfloyd>	AppAraat: there' bin, etc, lib under it
<pingfloyd>	you set that prefix when you compile
<AppAraat>	neonrooster: I don't believe in ghosts!
<pingfloyd>	and the program should be decent enough to divide it from there
<pingfloyd>	if it doesn't, trash it
<AppAraat>	neonrooster: Kane is dead and you know it!
<AppAraat>	pingfloyd: if it doesn't, then installing it in a 'container' might be another solution?
<madprops>	HIIIII
<pingfloyd>	AppAraat: it's your mess to handle if you want to
<AppAraat>	I thought containers were there to prevent said mess :p
<pingfloyd>	what containers
<AppAraat>	for example either jails, docker, or even vagrant.
<pingfloyd>	those serve a different purpose
<LMNOP>	fuck that crap
<pingfloyd>	that's the isolate instances
<malaprop>	AppAraat: make can do what you want, use it
<AppAraat>	LMNOP: how so? They seem pretty useful (albeit apparently not for this situation)
<LMNOP>	dont like puppet chef
<pingfloyd>	don't even think about reinventing the wheel if you don't understand the current system well.  And after you do, still don't reinvent it.
<LMNOP>	just cos its new doesnt mean it doesnt suck
<malaprop>	pingfloyd: Or do, because it's interesting
*	kopfkind_ is now known as kopfkind
<malaprop>	pingfloyd: So serious!
<pingfloyd>	not really
<recognosco>	AppAraat: as far as i understand, learning Linux/Unix philosophy, and doing things the correct way is something entirely different form getting things done. hence the invent of containers.
<LMNOP>	unix philosophy is not reinventing the wheel
<LMNOP>	you just dont know how to get stuff done
<malaprop>	LMNOP: As I understand it, inventing a better wheel made of less material is UNIX. Duct-taping together 10 wheels in the shape of a couch and marketing it as furniture is not.
<LMNOP>	malaprop, you are talking about monolithic design
<LMNOP>	that is anti-unix
<LMNOP>	bbl
<malaprop>	LMNOP: I am?
<SoItBegins>	Are we arguing about Systemd?
<LMNOP>	kinda
<pingfloyd>	SoItBegins: that argument already ended and the jury said systemd sucks
<malaprop>	LMNOP: Is cat monolithic?
<pingfloyd>	they said, "systemd seems like it would be an okay os, if only it had a decent init"
<MetaNova>	just like emacs is a decent OS, just lacks a decent editor
<pingfloyd>	systemd is the emacs of init
<MetaNova>	pingfloyd: that's the best analogy I've ever heard
<pingfloyd>	thanks
<malaprop>	pingfloyd: that's hard on emacs
<recognosco>	i don't know if systemd sucks or not. i am too uneducated to draw any such conclusions. but my only question is - why does try to do everything? i don't understand that mindset.
<MetaNova>	malaprop: lol
<pingfloyd>	it's not the end of the world if systemd is in use, but it does break unix tenet and that's not a good thing in the long run.
<hectortrope>	Hello all anyone here use mailx?
<recognosco>	also, if it sucks - why are a lot of the distributions adopting like the new best thing in town?
<pingfloyd>	recognosco: yeah, why are they?
<recognosco>	pingfloyd: no idea.
<pingfloyd>	you'd think some of them would distinguish themselves as a distro more
<pingfloyd>	now the distro have become even more similar
<pingfloyd>	normalized in a sense
<recognosco>	i can see why Red Hat and all it's derivatives would - it's their own code. they want to control the next most important after the kernel.
<recognosco>	but that's purely business.
<pingfloyd>	but why in the world would debian?
<recognosco>	yeah. i was dissapointed with that decission too.
<recognosco>	arch has it default. ubuntu. debian.
<pingfloyd>	I was pretty indifferent about systemd until that happened
<malaprop>	pingfloyd: Is it because fancy init managers are fashionable and systemd has the most aggressive salesmen?
<zChris>	what was the alternative?
<zChris>	Systemd vs ??
<recognosco>	lol. well. upstart?
<pingfloyd>	I'm even okay with a system that has a service manager as that isn't too greatly out of the scope of an init system
<malaprop>	zChrist: As complex non-solutions go, Upstart?
<pingfloyd>	zChris: sysv
<recognosco>	yeah well. sysv style scripts were not bad. i kinda liked them.
<malaprop>	recognosco: For most personal systems, even sysV is overkill
<malaprop>	recognosco: rc.init, rc.local. Done.
<malaprop>	recognosco: And a simple service manager if you so choose.
<Aldebaran>	https://vk.com/govgirl
<recognosco>	sure. i agree with you. but instead of making a better init system, we got a replacement operating system. that's where my problem is.
<hust921>	anyone know byobu?
<recognosco>	hust921: buobu is like screen replacement? i like tmux better.
<recognosco>	hust921: byobu is like screen replacement? i like tmux better.
*	sauvin moves recognosco's fingers AWAY from the up-arrow key
<AppAraat>	recognosco: IIRC it works with tmux, but it simply remaps tmux's keys.
<recognosco>	i swear the irc protocol needs a typo correction thing built into it
<hust921>	recognosco, yeah. Think byobu is build on tmux. Use screen a lot, but don't use many of the features
<hectortrope>	HEllo is there anyone to helpp me I am not able to send mails using postfix,mailx why?
<hust921>	wtf? just spammed some usernames for some reason :s
<malaprop>	recognosco: Make with the awk
<enigmus>	I have a epoll-based HTTP server. If I flood the server with requests using the tool "wrk", after the tool exits, the server ends up inactive waiting on epoll_wait(2). cat /proc/<pid>/net/sockstat shows high numbers like "TCP: inuse 250". If I do a single query via curl (at this point wrk has terminated), then epoll_wait() wakes up (with EPOLLIN|EPOLLRDHUP) and I can process a single request, but NOT the o
<enigmus>	ne from curl, one from the now defunct wrk. It's like there is a queue in the kernel that doesn't drain (with about 250 requests in there). It only drains 1 request if I perform 1 request. What the hell?

<nikoJ>	hey guys.. I'm currently doing check on a software raid5 array.. and one of the hard drives is obviously faulty.. I need to stop the check before I do more damage to the drive.. what do I do?
<nikoJ>	I know which drive it is because dmesg keeps outputting IO errors on the same drive
<recognosco>	diamondman: i am not aware how exciting the world of IPC is, but if there hasn't been a lot of growth in that area in the past 4 years, the answer should be as relevant today. the top answer recommends POSIX, because it's 1. newer, designed based on the mistakes of SysV and 2. easier to use
<recognosco>	diamondman: nanomsg, an alternative for 0mq, uses the POSIX IPC if i recall correctly.

<du5tball>	i'm trying to set up a webfilter for a few computers. however, setting up a proxy server the clients can connect to is useless, as the users have admin access and could change to proxy to unfiltered net. is there a way to use squid or similars as a webfilter, without having to configure any cliens?
<CoJaBo>	du5tball: What are you trying to filter?
<du5tball>	pr0n, games sites, similars
<CoJaBo>	You can do the filtering at the firewall for zero-configuration, but it's always going to be trivial to bypass.
<du5tball>	trivial as in "just enter the IP"?
<CoJaBo>	du5tball: Proxies. Even Google can be used as one, and you cannot filter Google without blocking all of it.
<peetaur2>	so block all of it.... your comment contains the solution
<CoJaBo>	du5tball: An AUP and remediation policies are really what you need.
<peetaur2>	sites that hotlink external javascript aren't worth viewing anyway (seriously, who redirects customers to 3rd party urls and has them execute this code as if it can somehow be trusted?)
<du5tball>	peetaur2: AUPs are not applicable. nobody would comply to them
<CoJaBo>	Disconnect from the internet, put up tinfoil on all the walls, doors, and windows to block any Internet from leaking in.
<du5tball>	it's for a small section of a company...
<CoJaBo>	du5tball: It's a social problem, not a technical one. If people don't comply, you can ultimately fire them.
<du5tball>	hell i wish i could.
<CoJaBo>	There's no magic filter that will block everything. You can't even come close; they're more a deterrent than anything.
<peetaur2>	let them run unfiltered... then they won't know what can and cannot be tracked; then track them and you can tell them you know what they're wasting time on, thus frauding you by accepting payment for not doing work
<CoJaBo>	^
<peetaur2>	but tracking may or may not be allowed depending on how communist your government is, unless you put it in the contract
<CoJaBo>	That's pretty standard.
<du5tball>	full situation: i am working for a company which trains mentally and bodily challenged people so they can do jobs. some of them went to jail and whatnot. there's an IT department run by them too. however, there are minors and german law requires at least a pr0n filter. the company also wants a filter for games and other leisure stuff. and no, i can't fire anyone

<du5tball>	on the proxy itself not, but on the clients
<peetaur2>	okay then your problem about that doesn't matter I think..
<peetaur2>	what you do is just block all traffic on all ports except from the proxy machine; then if they change their proxy settings, they don't get any internet

<jnylen>	have you tired turning it off and on again?
<annihilannic>	auth,authpriv,mail.none should do it
<survietamine>	annihilannic: yeah, tried that too, the rsyslogd manpage recommends to restart, so I restarted
<survietamine>	and no changes :/

<survietamine>	peetaur2: ok, so, it's no way with negation (!) ?
<peetaur2>	I treat mine like a firewall... first rule that matches takes the input away from the next

<annihilannic>	are you certain they're coming in with the facility/priority combinations you're handling?
<survietamine>	annihilannic: in the rsyslog config file, there is another line that is "mail.* -/var/log/mail.log" and this file is filled with same data as /var/log/syslog

<trssnd>	how do i figure out whether the root file system has barrier enabled or not?
<trssnd>	"cat /proc/fs/ext4/xvda1/options" has a line that reads "barrier"
<trssnd>	does that mean that barrier is enabled or that barrier has the default option for ext4 which is enabled?
<trssnd>	i know it's enabled in either case but still
<trssnd>	is this a fool proof way to know?
<peetaur2>	I would simply assume it is enabled unless you explicitly set it otherwise... it would be seriously broken if not
<trssnd>	thanks. what about ext3? for which by default the barrier is not set?
<trssnd>	according to http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/oneiric/man8/mount.8.html
<trssnd>	is there a place where i can understand the output of "cat /proc/fs/ext4/xvda1/options"?
<peetaur2>	I would think "options" means the same thing there and in the mount man pages
<trssnd>	also, there's one anomaly. "cat /proc/fs/ext4/xvdb/options" also has a line that reads "barrier". but xvdb is listed as ext3 in the mount command!
<peetaur2>	xvdb, not xvdb1 or similar?
<trssnd>	"/dev/xvdb on /mnt type ext3 (rw,_netdev)"
<trssnd>	they're different
<peetaur2>	does this clear it up at all?   grep barrier /proc/fs/ext*/*/options
<trssnd>	xvda1 is the AWS EBS storage
<trssnd>	xvdb is the ephemeral instance store
<trssnd>	they both have barrier listed
<trssnd>	i just tried your command
<peetaur2>	hmm I tried it and got the same...     /proc/fs/ext4/dm-13/options:barrier        /dev/mapper/data-testext3 on /mnt/test type ext3 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)
<captainfantastic>	I can't set environmental variables in a bash script. Any other way to do this?
<trssnd>	ya! this is very puzzling for me.
<peetaur2>	captainfantastic: why can't you?       export SOMEVAR="some value"
<captainfantastic>	peetaur2: I want to set multiple values all at once through a bash script.
<trssnd>	also, fstab doesn't have barrier set for either of them.
<trssnd>	LABEL=cloudimg-rootfs	/	 ext4	defaults,discard	0 0
<trssnd>	 /dev/xvdb	/mnt	auto	defaults,nobootwait,comment=cloudconfig	0	2
<peetaur2>	trssnd: barrier should be on by default; nobarrier turns it off I think
<trssnd>	even for ext3?
<peetaur2>	captainfantastic: export SOMEVAR1="some value 1"; export SOMEVAR2="some value 2"   ?
<peetaur2>	I think barriers have been used for a while now
<trssnd>	The ext3 filesystem does not enable write barriers by default.  Be  sure  to  enable barriers  unless  your  disks  are  battery-backed  one  way  or another.  Otherwise you risk filesystem corruption  in  case  of power failure.
<trssnd>	quoting from the manpage
<trssnd>	i see
<kerframil>	trssnd: manpages cannot always be trusted. I'm looking at 3.4 sources and it looks as though barriers are a default.
<trssnd>	oh!!
<kerframil>	trssnd: dmesg should tell you, anyway
<trssnd>	oh!
<trssnd>	Tried "dmesg | grep barrier" and got "[    1.043533] blkfront: xvda: barrier or flush: disabled; persistent grants: disabled; indirect descriptors: enabled;".
<trssnd>	xvda is the ext3 thing
<trssnd>	sorry
<trssnd>	xvda1 is the ext4 thing. xvdb is the ext3 thing.
<pingfloyd>	do you have a controller with a battery?
<trssnd>	kerframil: what i can gather from this is that barrier is default for both xvda1 and xvdb since neither are listed with "barrier or flush: disabled". is that right?
<kerframil>	trssnd: those messages don't concern ext* barriers. rather, the block devicee driver. I don't know xen but you can likely get some clues by reading xen-blkfront.c or otherwise researching the topic.

*	comodo_dragon is now known as kong0
<peetaur2>	survietamine: haha how terrible ... but technically you should use "service rsyslog restart" instead of the script (but I usually use the file too since it tab-completes)
<peetaur2>	and btw we use mostly Ubuntu server here, and I have never had such an issue...
<survietamine>	peetaur2: you are right, I know about that, I was just too lazy after I checked the name is rsyslog or rsyslogd, I just append restart to it. But I was sure that both do same things
<peetaur2>	they ought to be the same... but they aren't. And the difference should have only been the environment as far as I know, not also whether or not upstart actually even ran your command.
<peetaur2>	I think openrc is designed better... instead of #!/bin/[ba]sh, they use ~/.../openrc-run, so that openrc-run program has control of your script, regardless of how you run it. :)
<peetaur2>	and it is a shell script still, not some weird upstart thing or unit file

<peetaur2>	kanupatar: what is ltsi? for mostly any kernel, you can get it from the linux-stable git repo
<kanupatar>	peetaur2: long term support
<peetaur2>	survietamine: yes sadly Ubuntu depends on debian, so it was forced on them indirectly
<survietamine>	maybe this one: https://ltsi.linuxfoundation.org/what-is-ltsi
<peetaur2>	kanupatar: if you just want a vanilla 3.10.31, you could use linux-stable git
<survietamine>	peetaur2: sadly because I like upstart or you dislike systemd?
<survietamine>	s/I/you
<kanupatar>	peetaur2: i need the exact tarball for 3.10.31
<kanupatar>	lsi
<peetaur2>	survietamine: I don't like upstart, but it has not tortured me like systmed does any time you end up using it
<survietamine>	kanupatar: not here? 27.42] has quit [Ping timeout: 272 seconds]
<survietamine>	grr
<survietamine>	http://ltsi.linuxfoundation.org/downloads/releases
<peetaur2>	kanupatar: well I'm sure you'll find a newer one, but for that old one you'll have to find some archives that keep lots of versions (wasting huge space), or build it yourself from git
<peetaur2>	so there is 3.10.61 on the page survietamine linked, but not .31
<kanupatar>	peetaur2: no man
<kanupatar>	peetaur2: tried already but not getting the exact 3.10.31 ltsi
<jhodrien>	kanupatar: And why aren't you just git cloning and checking out v3.10.31-ltsi ?
<RANGERICO>	Could anyone help me with a problem. I would like to email me every 30 minutes the last 5 pictures created to a specific folder. How can I do this via this kind of line? echo "foo" | mail -a %f -s "bar" email@email.com
<kanupatar>	jhodrien: whole address?
<survietamine>	peetaur2: but it is in git, no? http://git.linuxfoundation.org/?p=ltsi-kernel.git;a=summary
<jhodrien>	Quite.
<ericbutters>	hi.. i produce a SIGSEGV at a well know place inside a shared lib. gdb tells me that crash is at 0xae6dfa88, the shared lib starts at 0xae5be340 so offset is 0x121748 right? looking into my mapfile the offset for the function that crashes is 0x2dc790 .. so what is wrong here??
<peetaur2>	survietamine: maybe... looks like that repo should have it. So kanupatar, you should clone that git and build it.

<BluesKaj>	Hiyas all

<ericbutters>	anyone here has knowledge with gdb and mapfiles?
<winsoff>	ericbutters, what is your problem?
<ericbutters>	winsoff: i produce a SIGSEGV at a well know place inside a  shared lib. gdb tells me that crash is at 0xae6dfa88, the  shared lib starts at 0xae5be340 so offset is 0x121748  right? looking into my mapfile the offset for the function  that crashes is 0x2dc790 .. so what is wrong here??
<ericbutters>	.text._ZN6WebKit12WebPageProxy18viewStateDidChangeEj  0x00000000002dc790      0x312 WebPageProxy.o
<winsoff>	Could the function be calling something at the 0xae6dfa88?
<ericbutters>	the crash is simple: int a = *p; and p is NULL.. that is inside _ZN6WebKit12WebPageProxy18viewStateDidChangeEj
<ericbutters>	i don't understand how to find the function offset from the information i have. so, is the above approach correct?
<winsoff>	Wait, what is at 0x2dc790 (offset, of course)

<skx71>	:p
<ericbutters>	i think so yes, and i thougt that crash-addr - base-addr should be the offset where pc is, so that should be something 0x2dc790 + x
<ericbutters>	?
<winsoff>	ericbutters, to my understanding, the offset
<winsoff>	is actually
<winsoff>	offset from the code section
<winsoff>	not from the start of the binary
*	argoneus is now known as Kingsquee
<skx71>	you guys hacking the kernel

<skx71>	?
<skx71>	which kernel
<winsoff>	So if you have data before that code section, or anything else, then that will mess with your offset locations
<winsoff>	skx71, clarify him on that.  He was talking about a crash.
<ericbutters>	winsoff: how do i get the code section address with objdump?
<winsoff>	Let me paste.
<winsoff>	cbutters> winsoff: i produce a SIGSEGV at a well know place inside a  shared lib. gdb tells me that crash is at 0xae6dfa88, the  shared lib starts at 0xae5be340 so offset is 0x121748  right? looking into my mapfile the offset for the function  that crashes is 0x2dc790 .. so what is wrong here??
<quebre>	hello
<winsoff>	How do you know where the crash happened, ericbutters, if you are not certain of the offset?
<ericbutters>	gdb tells me the address
<ericbutters>	and the library
<quebre>	i'm trying to figure out what is wrong during creating RPM, i'm getting following error at the end: "/usr/lib/rpm/brp-compress: line 8: cd: /root/rpmbuild/BUILDROOT/dcc-dccproc-1.3.158-0.x86_64: No such file or directory" - it appends x86_64 to the end of directory name, any ideas what i'm doing wrong ?
<winsoff>	I mean, how do you correlate that to the function, as it seems like you have not tried what shows up at the mapfile's offset
<viksa>	how to configure reverse dns? like i got additional ips venet:0:1 to point it to have reverse when you do dns 1.2.3.4 to point like test.in(domain example) ?
<winsoff>	viksa, that's normal dns.  Do you mean editing the hosts file?
<viksa>	i mean when i type /dns ip to reverse to the domain not to ip i tried editing /etc/hosts to point IP to dns but not work
<winsoff>	quebre, unsure.  ericbutters, that is an interesting question.
<winsoff>	viksa: has /etc/hosts been loaded into memory
<ericbutters>	winsoff: i know in what function the crash is, because i force the crash.. i want to understand how to debug with map files. but the calculation does not match.. i am missing something
<winsoff>	since your last edit?
<viksa>	20min ago also i reboot but still same
<winsoff>	ericbutters, ah, I get you, now.  Are you certain your map file is correct?
<ericbutters>	winsoff: i think so, yes.. but maybe i do a clean build
<winsoff>	ericbutters, try that real quick, as I am not entirely certain why it would not match up, other than the data bit.
<winsoff>	I think the map file should properly tell you how large the "head" sections are
<thevishy>	can I grep for a pattern in a file and print only the matching patterns?
<rascul>	-o
<rascul>	grep -o pattern files
<thevishy>	perfect
<thevishy>	thanks rascul
*	teakey_ is now known as teakey
*	Parade|Away is now known as MonkehParade
<limbo>	viksa: ask the owner of the IP-address to handle reverse pointing for you
<winsoff>	limbo: Yeah, I determined that as well, as it seems impossible from there.  I really thought it was a forward problem before I learned the rest.
<winsoff>	ericbutters, what were the results of the build?
<ericbutters>	winsoff: its the same
<xsi>	.w reservoir
<souuell>	LE GPdate
<winsoff>	ericbutters, what is the exact difference between the expected offset and the actual offset?
<ericbutters>	winsoff: expected: 2dc790 actual: 121748
<winsoff>	so a difference of 1bb048; check my math?
<ericbutters>	correct
<winsoff>	What starts at 1bb048?
<winsoff>	Does that actually denote anything in the mapfile OR gdb?
<ericbutters>	winsoff: i am going to doublecheck.. i came back with the results
<ericbutters>	thanks
<winsoff>	Why does GDB have to look for an offset, anyway?

<HyP3r>	Is that right?
<bls>	HyP3r: OK, now /dev/loop0 will act as if the sd card is a local disk
<bls>	err, sd card image
<HyP3r>	bls: the problem is: the card image contains a full msdos partion table
<HyP3r>	Shouldn't I have now /dev/loop0p0? Or something like that?
<bls>	HyP3r: no, loopback doesn't work that way. if you want to interact with single partitions you have to do some math on the offsets
<HyP3r>	Okay offsets, automatically dection of partitions isn't aviable?
<bls>	not right now
<HyP3r>	like mmcblk0p1
<peetaur2>	HyP3r: you mean like   kpartx -av /dev/loop0    ?

<sybariten>	superboot: theres instructions on ftp connectivity in general but i rarely see any discussions online on how to use it as a startup argument
<triceratux>	sybariten: did you try "mc / ftp://user:pass@hostname" thats what the manpage says & it worked first time for me.

<DX099>	 I'm looking for a way to obtain geoip stats with a nice map from my nginx log file on a Debian host but has no idea where to begin, can someone help?
<baldfat>	Fenikkusu: first #bsd would be better. Secondly if you are just using it for personal backups go UFS not ZFS you dont need th snap shots
<triceratux>	sybariten: doesnt ring a bell. tinycore, timecapusle, totalcommander ?
<sybariten>	the latter
*	triceratux realises its tab completion
<sybariten>	hehe
<triceratux>	sybariten: nope youre way ahead of me :)
<sybariten>	total commander.... it has incremental search that can be done without the use of a qualifier or key combo
<sybariten>	you can do it in MC too, but you have to press alt-s

<[R]>	what makes you think there is some magic log repository of every channel?
<triceratux>	DarkElement: only if youve been creating them yourself. strictly speaking theyre not supposed to be public
<ayecee>	[R]: you may have misread the question
<DarkElement>	Dang, I could really use a gb file of logs
<[R]>	ayecee: no
<ayecee>	[R]: yes
<[R]>	how so?
<dfzxh>	[R]: please stop trolling the channel
<ayecee>	i'll leave that as an exercise for you XD
<dfzxh>	[R]: he was asking if there was one that exists
<[R]>	lol
<dfzxh>	[R]: its entirely likely someone is publishing these chat logs on a website somewhere
<DarkElement>	Good point, ill look for it on web
<dfzxh>	DarkElement: curious, what do you need it for? markov bot?
<DarkElement>	What is a markov bot? 
<ayecee>	etymological research!
<DarkElement>	I forget markov chain
<dfzxh>	DarkElement: a markov chain is when you make a list of all the common words that came after or before a word, and you try to piece together a sentence from it
<dfzxh>	DarkElement: thats the gist anyways
<socomm>	DarkElement: There are websites which have logs of irc channels.
<DarkElement>	dfzxh, ahh, maybe i'll add that to my AI
<dfzxh>	markov bots usually end up saying some hilarious stuff
<DarkElement>	like the classroom sentence?
<DarkElement>	Mine is for an AI that learns questions and responses.
<dfzxh>	especially if you feed them sources that are explicit
<[R]>	wtf dude, first you're making an ai that can responsd... next thing you know you're computer is killing you

<obXiDeJSFQ>	In case anyone cares about my PC freezing issue:- Apparently (Based off Google) Linux with writing with USB 3.0 = bad time, reverted back to USB 2.0 and now seems to be working okay, which is upsetting (Capped at 35MByte/s instead of the 140MByte/s+ I was getting before)
<toothe>	The only problem I'm having with GPG at this point...are from applications that use gpg. I can't seem to use my subkeys to encrypt or sign.
<ayecee>	obXiDeJSFQ: is this particular to certain hardware?
<socomm>	obXiDeJSFQ: File a bug report.
<socomm>	Also I'm saddened to hear about your great misfortune.
<obXiDeJSFQ>	ayecee: No idea, took me awhile to find anything off Google so I have to assume it's an obscure issue, if any sort of writing with USB 3.0 caused instant failure I feel like it'd probably be higher up on the Google ranks, but I've only tested it with my desktop.

<booboy>	does the ntp user/group uid/gid on a normal linux system range between 1-100? is there a standard uid/gid to set it?
<socomm>	booboy: No.
<socomm>	booboy: It depends on the distro.
<booboy>	socomm: ok thanks for the quick answer <3
<socomm>	booboy: You can run 'id <username>' to get the ntp users info.
<socomm>	booboy: But there's no guarantee that the user will always be called ntp.
<booboy>	socomm: i was adding the user/group manually. it is a fresh install of antergos and the ntp.service file was failing to activate. turns out the ntp user/group wasnt even created for some weird reason.
<booboy>	adding the user/group fixed the issue though.
<qwyos>	How long (approx.) does it take to switch a task on a typical x86 processor running Linux kernel?

<socomm>	Has anyone tried rust?
<ElectricTriangle>	Ooh, antisocial simulators.
<ElectricTriangle>	Non.
<socomm>	ElectricTriangle: Talking about the rust language.
<ElectricTriangle>	socomm: Talking about nearly all of the players.
<socomm>	http://www.rust-lang.org/
<ElectricTriangle>	Oh.
<ElectricTriangle>	Never heard of that.
<[R]>	omg
<[R]>	thats all i hear
<[R]>	rust rust rust
<polymute>	I hear great things about it
<polymute>	never seen it used for a serious project though
<ElectricTriangle>	Why should I use this over Python, I wonder?
<[R]>	they claim rust is on par with C
<socomm>	It suppose to be blazing fast, and prevents segfaults.
<ElectricTriangle>	And yet it's interpreted?
<socomm>	Says right there in the home page.
<[R]>	who said it was interpreted?
<socomm>	ElectricTriangle: Compiled.
<socomm>	https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/hello-world.html
<ElectricTriangle>	[R]: Questions.
<socomm>	ElectricTriangle: Its backed by google, so ....
<socomm>	But then again so is Go, and that hasn't exactly taken off (yet).
<[R]>	they're all stupid
<ElectricTriangle>	I'll keep my readability thx
<[R]>	its just academic crap
<socomm>	Python is readable?
<ElectricTriangle>	socomm: Rust is readable?
<socomm>	ElectricTriangle: If you can read C, yes.
<ElectricTriangle>	socomm: Mm.
<polymute>	ruby > python
<polymute>	discuss
<socomm>	Ruby, no thanks.
<ElectricTriangle>	polymute: I can't speak to that, but the merits of any language only matter to the person using them.
<socomm>	I actually tried to like Ruby, since Puppet is written in that, but nope.
<ElectricTriangle>	Let's all just agree that bash scripts are awful.
<polymute>	I was just being contentious
<polymute>	there are things I like about ruby and python
<socomm>	ElectricTriangle: I actually like bash.
<ElectricTriangle>	socomm: But bash actually IS hard to understand D:
<socomm>	ElectricTriangle: Hahaha.
<[R]>	i love how everyone accts like ruby is this new fangled language
<[R]>	zomg... ruby is so cool and new!
<[R]>	thats what they say
<ElectricTriangle>	[R]: Have you heard of rust?
<ElectricTriangle>	:p
<socomm>	Isn't ruby that one language that was designed to make the speaker/programmer smarter?
<[R]>	but rust IS new...
<polymute>	naw, I just like a lot of what people have done with ruby
<socomm>	By a japanese craetor?
<[R]>	socomm: with no beard!
<polymute>	in my opinion good languages have good communities
<socomm>	[R]: Pffft. Dropped!
<ElectricTriangle>	A coder with no beard?
<ElectricTriangle>	For shame
<[R]>	all good languages were made by people with fabulous beards
<[R]>	i myself have a great neckbeard goiing on
<[R]>	but i dont write languages
<socomm>	polymute: I don't know about that.
<ElectricTriangle>	[R]: Max beard cred.
<socomm>	http://www.technologyreview.com/review/536356/toolkits-for-the-mind/
<polymute>	let me rephrase, part of what I value in a language is what has been contributed to it and been made publicly available for it
<polymute>	part of the value of ruby (to me) is tools like rails
<ElectricTriangle>	polymute: I value ease of use, and readability.
<socomm>	The article pretty much concludes that in order to write good program you need a good language.
<ElectricTriangle>	And having enforced spacing without goofy brackets.
<ElectricTriangle>	c:
<socomm>	ElectricTriangle: Enforced spagin? :-/
<socomm>	s/spagin/spacing/
<ElectricTriangle>	socomm: Python.
<socomm>	ElectricTriangle: Yes, I know.
<ElectricTriangle>	I... don't see where you got spagin from.
<socomm>	I like python, but not the whole enforced spacing deal.
<ElectricTriangle>	socomm: Only major downside to that IMO is the ability to use spaces OR tabs
<ElectricTriangle>	Silly
<polymute>	tabs > spaces
<ElectricTriangle>	polymute: Always.
<xeon-enouf>	heh [R]: i suppose you haven't heard of the recent fecal beard study released from a prominent scientific literature doohickey?
<ElectricTriangle>	:c
<xeon-enouf>	more like max beard s/cred/crud/ :-P
<ElectricTriangle>	But what will people do if they don't have a beard to scratch while they point their tongue at a precise angle D:
<ElectricTriangle>	How will science be done?
<xeon-enouf>	that's what french ticklers were invented for
<[R]>	xeon-enouf: wtf...
<xeon-enouf>	indeed
<[R]>	xeon-enouf: to be honest... its REALLY annoying
<[R]>	i don't know how people do it
<[R]>	i'm about ready to chop it off
<xeon-enouf>	i know i know
<[R]>	the other day i was in the office of the lab manager at my work with my (female) boss and he said i had to shave it for when i went to the "nudie bars"
<xeon-enouf>	haha
<toothe>	is there a way to totally purge my KDE settings?
<toothe>	or at least my Kmail settings
<xeon-enouf>	toothe: make a new user, done
<[R]>	toothe: delete them from your home dir
<toothe>	them ?
<[R]>	you said kmail settings
<xeon-enouf>	i think most live in ~/.kde
<toothe>	i've deleted my kmail settings like 5 times, it keps coming back :-(
<xeon-enouf>	or something
<toothe>	so
*	kurahaupo was last clean-shaven for his second-to-last girlfriend, and he's been married for 16 years
<xeon-enouf>	or used to
<toothe>	i deleted like kmailrc in a few places...no dice.
<[R]>	kurahaupo: how do you do it?
<Luke-Jr>	is there a way to have Linux automatically shutdown my hard drives when they're not in use?
<[R]>	Luke-Jr: hdparm can do it... but they tend to wake up a lot anyway
<toothe>	Luke-Jr: what do you mean shutdown your HD ?
<xeon-enouf>	hdparm, or sdparm, depending on iface
<Luke-Jr>	[R]: yeah, hence the desire to have it automatic ☺
<ElectricTriangle>	Luke-Jr: They should do it anyway if they're not being used for a period of time, or hdparm can do that.
<xeon-enouf>	ElectricTriangle: not really, to your first premise
<kurahaupo>	[R]: do what?
<ElectricTriangle>	xeon-enouf: To what do you reply?
<socomm>	French ticklers. HAHAHAHAH!!! WTF?!
<xeon-enouf>	"they should do it anyways" ElectricTriangle
<[R]>	kuahara: put up with a beard
<ElectricTriangle>	xeon-enouf: My drives spin down when not in use, they're not too special.
<xeon-enouf>	[R]: maybe his partner likes it
<xeon-enouf>	ElectricTriangle: you're weird
<xeon-enouf>	then
<ElectricTriangle>	xeon-enouf: Sorry, I try not to be. Or something...
*	xeon-enouf loves it when his SSDs spin down O_o
<[R]>	xeon-enouf: ii dunno if i could put up wit hthe itchyness
<xeon-enouf>	ElectricTriangle: a laptop?
<kurahaupo>	there's nothing to "put up with", it's perfectly normal, like having hair on top of my head is normal.
<xeon-enouf>	[R]: that's what she said
<ElectricTriangle>	xeon-enouf: I have troubles when my SSDs start spinning.
<[R]>	xeon-enouf: from the STDs?
<ElectricTriangle>	xeon-enouf: A desktop system.
<xeon-enouf>	hehe
<kurahaupo>	itchy? nope.
<xeon-enouf>	ElectricTriangle: a rpi?
<socomm>	I remember hearing that Electric cars were being sold with speakers to simulate engine noises - for blind people and such.
<xeon-enouf>	:-p
<[R]>	ElectricTriangle: yeah, my compputer has problesm when my ssd is spinning too...
<socomm>	We should start selling SSD add-ons to emulate hard drive spin-ups/downs and little ticks.
<xeon-enouf>	socomm: well - for ALL pedestrians, and cyclists, etc
<ElectricTriangle>	xeon-enouf: A pi... no way.
<ElectricTriangle>	socomm: This is true.
<ElectricTriangle>	What would we do without noisy drives D:
*	kurahaupo imagines the whole computer spinning around the ssd
<xeon-enouf>	they put typewriter/teletype soundtracks in newsrooms these days
<socomm>	xeon-enouf: hehe
<xeon-enouf>	kurahaupo: the image is surreal
<socomm>	tac-tac-tac-tac-tac
<toothe>	no matter how many KDE files I delete, it still seems to know my mailbox.
<toothe>	this is really annoying.
<ElectricTriangle>	kurahaupo: I more imagined it spinning wildly inside the case.
<[R]>	toothe: so make a new user
<xeon-enouf>	toothe: "it" .. is possessed
<toothe>	yeah
<kurahaupo>	xeon-enouf: especially since it's rack-mounted
<toothe>	well...i have stuff saved under this user lol
<toothe>	i'd have to reconfigure everything!
<xeon-enouf>	kurahaupo: oh .. even more fun
<toothe>	its cuz kDE's configs aren't standard.
<[R]>	kurahaupo: boobs can't hold up a computer...
<toothe>	stuff is in various places.
<ElectricTriangle>	toothe: .config, .kdesomethingorother
<xeon-enouf>	toothe: tried a kde channel?
<toothe>	xeon-enouf: that channel is dead.
<socomm>	[R]: You didn't invest enough on those boobs.
<kurahaupo>	toothe: strace kde and see what files it's opening
<xeon-enouf>	toothe: other networks? for example, irc.gnome.org exists
<toothe>	aren't gnome and KDE enemies?
<ElectricTriangle>	[R]: You clearly haven't invested in industrial-grade equipment.
<xeon-enouf>	kurahaupo: o m g.. it'll be a 500GB file
<xeon-enouf>	toothe: clearly
<[R]>	LOL
<socomm>	toothe: Enemies? Their only enemy is good design.
<toothe>	is that a joke?
<xeon-enouf>	toothe: kmail? is exim4 running (somehow) too?
<kurahaupo>	xeon-enouf: more scary, a full rack is over  400kg
<toothe>	xeon-enouf: no?
<toothe>	i must have screwed up the settings somehow.
<toothe>	I don't even know.
<ElectricTriangle>	kurahaupo, :C
<socomm>	toothe: http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121204135112/trollpasta/images/1/13/Thats_the_joke.jpg
<xeon-enouf>	toothe: checked all the relevant /etc/ settings?
<toothe>	socomm: hahahaha
<toothe>	You suck McBain!
<xeon-enouf>	kurahaupo: i can bench that  /kidding
<xeon-enouf>	toothe: really, add a new user, then slowly copy over relevant configs as the need arises; paying attention all along, ofcourse to what's needed and what's not relevant
<toothe>	xeon-enouf: I might do just that.
<toothe>	xeon-enouf: I appreciate it.
<xeon-enouf>	toothe: eventually, you'll see which files copied are causing the issue - hopefully
<kurahaupo>	xeon-enouf: but can you bench it at 7200 rpm? ;-)
<xeon-enouf>	kurahaupo: sure; so long as we're in takeoff mode :-P
<xeon-enouf>	actually, i have to go into cirque de soliel mode, heh
*	cyphar is now known as Guest60399
<JohnnyL>	http://pastie.org/10192777
*	toothe wonder's what's the Ubuntu way of getting a truecrypt replacement.
<toothe>	It doesn't seem like Ubuntu supports a TrueCrypt replacement yet...sucks...
<socomm>	Truecrypt is used to encrypt hard drives no?
<toothe>	sorta.
<toothe>	you create an encrypted file container.
<toothe>	i need a good way to store my PGP key backup...
<toothe>	and im not sure how...
<Hwkiller>	toothe: print it :p
<socomm>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup
<toothe>	Hwkiller: I"d love to do that, but it would take forever to reconstitute.
<socomm>	toothe: Print it out, and then swallow the key print out.
<Hwkiller>	toothe: scan and ocr :p
<toothe>	someone mentioned that earlier, OCR.
<toothe>	Is that a program I can DL ?
<socomm>	I wonder if Android has an OCR app.
<toothe>	see, ideally i'd print out the QR coe.
<toothe>	code*
<socomm>	toothe: OCR is a technology.
<Hwkiller>	toothe: it's a process; you find a program that does OCR
<socomm>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition
<Hwkiller>	and yes, there are a few
<toothe>	but I can't get qren to render large data.
<Hwkiller>	I use ocrfeeder with tesseract
<toothe>	do tell...
<socomm>	toothe: Apparently there are a few android OCR apps out there.
*	toothe ddg's
<danieldg>	iirc there's a program that reduces the PGP key to minimal data for recovery combined with the public key, try using that prior to QR encoding
<toothe>	okay okay okay...here's the questoin
<toothe>	can I use qrencode to generate LARGE QR codes?
<toothe>	that would be ideal.
<socomm>	toothe: Have you tried?
<toothe>	yes....
<socomm>	Actually the QR code idea is pretty cool.
<toothe>	s there a limit to the size?
<toothe>	because I noticed I can't make very large QR codes.
<danieldg>	whatever KDE uses to generate QR codes will happily generate them for a 400-byte key that I tested
<Hwkiller>	yeah I made one for my pgp key too
<Hwkiller>	well, for the public key
<toothe>	danieldg: what does KDE use?
<Hwkiller>	so others could just scan and import
<danieldg>	no idea
<socomm>	http://blog.qr4.nl/page/QR-Code-Data-Capacity.aspx
<toothe>	I don't trust OCR for something as sensitive as my PGP key, it just failed on my address
<socomm>	toothe: Depends on the size and version.
<Hwkiller>	it's worked well for me
<toothe>	socomm: So, is that to say that QR codes have a limit in size?
<socomm>	toothe: Of course.
<toothe>	i'd prefer something digital.
<toothe>	not analog
<toothe>	and ocr seems analog
<socomm>	toothe: How big is the gpg key? In terms of data bits.
<Hwkiller>	well, you could just put it on a usb drive and hide it somewhere
<toothe>	oh bits? darn...its 3 private keys, 2 are 4096, 1 is 8192
<toothe>	131072 bits
<toothe>	+ metadata
<socomm>	toothe: Don't think you could fit that in a QR code.
<danieldg>	split the file and use multiple codes
<toothe>	darn.
<socomm>	danieldg: Of course.
<toothe>	!!!!!!
<toothe>	that's such an obvious solution!
<toothe>	why didn't that occur to me!
<toothe>	lacks elegance, but so?
*	toothe experiments.
<FoolsRun>	Hi, I need some basic bash shell scripting help. I need to do a while loop for while the output of a shell command doesn't contain a grep'ed value. Basically while ! hcitool con | grep $MAC   --how do I write that?
<socomm>	FoolsRun: /j #bash
<FoolsRun>	socomm: sure thing. Thanks.
<go|dfish>	FoolsRun: you could write it just like that
<tpw_rules>	if i have a usb3 hub with several usb2 devices connected to it, will each usb2 device be able to transfer at max speed (connect to a usb 3 computer)? not sure of a generic channel to ask
<socomm>	tpw_rules: Not all at same time.
<socomm>	tpw_rules: They are obviously sharing one wire to the PC or whatever that wire is connected to.
<tpw_rules>	but usb3 is about 10x the speed of usb2
<tpw_rules>	so can it send 10 usb2 devices at once or am i missing something
<socomm>	tpw_rules: Set up an experiment and see for yourself.
<tpw_rules>	i'm wondering before i buy the hardware
<socomm>	tpw_rules: I'm not sure, ask on #hardware.
<tpw_rules>	ah ok. wasn't sure the channel
<DanMan01001>	tpw_rules, there is always going to be theoretical maximum transfer rates, but you almost never get close to achieving those
<clarjon1>	especially when cheap parts are used
<Psi-Jack>	Heh, I wonder if there's a TetraHub-like technology for the USB 3 like there was for USB 2 and 1.1.
<tpw_rules>	DanMan01001: well obviously
<tpw_rules>	but if i use a usb3 hub to connect, say, 4 usb2 drives to a computer, will it be faster overall than a usb2 hub
<DanMan01001>	my point being, there is no hard fast rule for putting those numbers together... you will just need to buy a hub and try it out
<tpw_rules>	what about theory?
<tpw_rules>	if it's not theoretically possible, then no use spending the money
<Psi-Jack>	tpw_rules: Do you have a Linux question?
<tpw_rules>	i do not. i just am unsure of the channel. i'll stop if you wish
<Psi-Jack>	The proper channel would be ##hardware
<tpw_rules>	yeah. i just got linked there. sorry for the bother
<sauvin>	I found no problem with this guy asking about USB hubs in this channel.
<Psi-Jack>	I saw none either, until he continued for longer than he really should've.
<DanMan01001>	yeah it seemed like he was trying instigate a little bit
<sauvin>	What else was going on at the time?
<Psi-Jack>	Well, since he completely de-railed the channel from someone actually asking a Linux question..
<sauvin>	We have such limited capacity that we can sustain only one thread of convo at a time?
*	DanMan01001 sighs
<Psi-Jack>	Heh, oh, and the guy was talking through his eggdrop bot. :)
<sauvin>	So?
<stevecam>	socomm, where may i find MWL? cant find it in google
<socomm>	stevecam: It was a joke. :)
<stevecam>	ok lol very funny hahaha
<stevecam>	Psi-Jack, so how was your day?
<Psi-Jack>	Not too shabby.
<socomm>	stevecam: But if you're interested there is such a thing as NetBSD on a toaster.
<socomm>	https://www.embeddedarm.com/software/arm-netbsd-toaster.php
<Psi-Jack>	stevecam: Determined that I can't use Fedora 22 beta 3 on my laptop since it doesn't even boot, due to some init.d bugs present in it, and/or X video display driver issues.
<Psi-Jack>	Went out to a very nice sushi place that actually had Okinawan beer that my wife loves, since she's from Okinawa. :)
<Psi-Jack>	With co-worker friends. :)
<socomm>	Psi-Jack: You're asian?
<Psi-Jack>	socomm: My wife is.
<stevecam>	socomm, that looks delicious, i would say that it looks like an iphone but it appears they acknowledge BSD dev's
<viscera>	when did #archlinux get more users than #ubuntu?
<Psi-Jack>	viscera: Ask #archlinux?
<desayuno>	cuz irc
<Psi-Jack>	Oh, yeah, and that ^^
<OERIAS>	It's like rain on your wedding day, it's a free ride but you've already paid. It's the good advice that you didn't take and who would have it figures!
<viscera>	(still) trying to decide which distro to install.
<stevecam>	Psi-Jack, i doubt buggy X drivers would be preventing you from booting
<viscera>	leaning towards ubuntu because lazyness
<desayuno>	em
<desayuno>	ew
<Psi-Jack>	stevecam: Oh, it boots up, but never actually runs the installer. successfully anyway. :)
<Psi-Jack>	viscera: Wanna be lazy, and easy going at the same time? Fedora.
<viscera>	Psi-Jack: that was my first choice but there were graphical glitches... i want to see if it happens in another distro
<stevecam>	viscera, Ubuntu is a great choice
<Psi-Jack>	Graphical glitches?
<viscera>	Psi-Jack: you know how you can "switch user" in gnome? fedora would momentarily display a locked session's desktop while switching or shutting down, which i didn't like at all
<Psi-Jack>	There's also another favorite of mine, Korora, which is basically Fedora with a few more default packages and 3rd party repos pre-installed for you, like infinality fonts that look soooo much better. (though you can install those on Fedora yourself, just Korora does it for you, basically)
<Psi-Jack>	viscera: That's a Gnome specific bug.
<viscera>	Psi-Jack: damn.
<viscera>	Psi-Jack: maybe unity doesn't do it
<Psi-Jack>	Believe me, if Fedora does it, any distro would, for Gnome specifically.. Because Fedora is the flagship distro for Gnome.
<Psi-Jack>	Unity is also putrid crap.
<viscera>	i don't mind it, and apparently it's faster in 15.04
<Psi-Jack>	Try KDE or XFCE, preferring KDE. :)
<viscera>	although it's based on gnome so it still might be fail
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<viscera>	Psi-Jack: xfce has video tearing issues for my hardware
<Psi-Jack>	It's based on whatever they decide to base it on THIS release. LOL
<viscera>	Psi-Jack: kde takes too much work to get usable
<viscera>	(lazy)
<Psi-Jack>	Unity's gone from Being GTK+ to Qt, to GTK+, to their own stuff with a combination of other things crapped in, etc.
<Psi-Jack>	Not really. KDE is easily setup in just a few minutes.
<viscera>	Psi-Jack: i think that is upcoming
<viscera>	Psi-Jack: i've used it before. it's work.
<sauvin>	I've been using KDE for years without complaint. What do you have to do to it to get it "usable"?
<stevecam>	viscera, consider this, ubuntu a typical audience for end-users, so support is a little more mainstream, it is built on top of debian, which is also a great choice if you are looking for a "cleaner" option
<Psi-Jack>	In fact, KDE's a whole lot easier to setup than any other DE, because everything is configurable, not hidden.
<viscera>	sauvin: i couldn't remember everything right now as it's been quite a while. the first thing that comes to mind was spending hours trying to make it not burn my eyes and/or be visually appealing without success. also, the file manager was annoying, dropping .directory files everywhere. also, you can't just search the start menu by pressing start, you have to use third party software for that, i can't remember if i got that working. probably 10
<viscera>	other things i can't remember.
<viscera>	oh, and the icon only task bar thingy was buggy with vertical orientation
<viscera>	and multi monitor (lvds+vga on a thinpad r61) was buggy
<Psi-Jack>	KDE has never dropped any .directory files anywhere. Though Mac OS X drops .DS_store files everywhere on network shares.
<viscera>	Psi-Jack: pretty sure it's dolphin that does it
<Psi-Jack>	Dolphin does not.
<socomm>	Gotta love Apple.
<viscera>	well i have no system to check on, so i'll take your word for it
<stevecam>	viscera, maybe debian?
<Psi-Jack>	socomm: Yeah.. heh
<Psi-Jack>	socomm: I had to disable that .DS_store thing on my work MBP. :)
<Psi-Jack>	viscera: I've been using KDE since KDE 1.0
<socomm>	I stopped using KDE after they introduced the whole Plasma thing.
<Psi-Jack>	Plasma is pretty awesome,. :)
<Psi-Jack>	Plasma 5 is a bit of a piece of work, but improved from Plasma 4.
<viscera>	stevecam: i can't remember why i turned away from debian. i remember the software being too old for my desktop tastes, with backports not covering my use cases. i also remember hitting bugs with various packaged desktop apps.
<viscera>	again, it's been a while
<stevecam>	how long is a while?
<viscera>	stevecam: the stable release before jessie
<viscera>	uh... wheezy?
<Psi-Jack>	Well, I stand corrected, that .directory thing is a dolphin feature, when you change the view of that specific directory view.
<viscera>	Psi-Jack: how's plasma 5's maturity? i was watching a youtube video review of it and it didn't seem fully baked just yet
<viscera>	it looks better than 4 at least
<Psi-Jack>	Easily disabled, though. Settings->Configure Dolphin->General->Behaviour, turn off "Remember View properties for all folders"
<viscera>	i'm actually very happy with windows 8 except for the fact that it has no *nix backend :(
<viscera>	i'm wanting to do webdev work and it's painful on windows
<Psi-Jack>	viscera: 5.3.0 is definitely looking much better.
<stevecam>	viscera, Wheezy isn't that old
<stevecam>	socomm, i was looking at the mailing lists and their chat room on LFS, i noticed that it had being slowing down a bit, and they weren't receiving too many donations, was thinking people may of moved on
<viscera>	Psi-Jack: fair enough
<Psi-Jack>	I just upgraded to Plasma 5.3.0 Friday though. heh heh
<Psi-Jack>	But, I have yet to actually see problems I was seeing in 5.2.x
<viscera>	stevecam: it's been too long... i remember spending ages messing with fonts and dpi in wheezy's gnome and i'm not sure if i ever got it how i wanted it
<viscera>	probably my own ignorance, but yeah
<stevecam>	viscera, there is an element of being mainstream in a distro, what are you looking for?
<viscera>	stevecam: windows 8.1 plus unix ;)
*	Psi-Jack gets the rope.
<viscera>	Psi-Jack: buy a girl a drink first!
<Psi-Jack>	viscera: I just got my wife several already. :)
<stevecam>	viscera, there is Services for Unix by Microsoft and Cygwin for that.....
<viscera>	eew
<Psi-Jack>	heh heh
<stevecam>	viscera, do you WANT a distro?
<Psi-Jack>	Anyways, time to try to sleep. ;)
<viscera>	stevecam: i'm defaulting to ubuntu
<viscera>	stevecam: see above :)
<viscera>	stevecam: i'd run bsd if it had proper chrome/flash support
<viscera>	stevecam: i'll fall back to arch if ubuntu burns me too hard
<pingfloyd>	viscera: it doesn't?
<stevecam>	I love Ubuntu, but I also read LFS, so that balances me out quite well
<socomm>	Not supporting flash falls on the 'con' column now adays?
<socomm>	Is it 2003?
<socomm>	I thought chrome spied on its users.
<socomm>	I don't think I like being part of Skynet.
<stevecam>	socomm, it does
<viscera>	socomm: my files are in dropbox, i'm already owned
*	zcm is now known as Guest89024
<Sir_Leto>	use chromium
<pingfloyd>	yeah lack of a chrome support is a bonus in my eyes
<stevecam>	socomm, they also give you chromium, the spy-free version
<viscera>	technically the only four distros you can run for proper chrome support are ubuntu, debian, fedora and opensuse
<stevecam>	If anybody is going to spy on me, I would rather it be Google
<pingfloyd>	the real question is how well does firefox run on it
<Sir_Leto>	Google can do no wrong?
<Sir_Leto>	So far
<viscera>	i'm pretty sure you can easily be spied on regardless of the browser you use
*	Guest89024 is now known as zcm
<Sir_Leto>	All computers have a pretty unique fingerprint
<viscera>	does minecraft run at the same speed on linux as it does on windows?
<socomm>	viscera: Does it run on at the same speed on every windows machine?
<Sir_Leto>	not sure
<viscera>	socomm: for the same machine
<viscera>	i don't play but i wanna try it out
<Sir_Leto>	that might really depend on the drivers
<viscera>	i should probably dual boot for a while
<socomm>	Also, Minecraft?! Are we 12?
<Sir_Leto>	which are sometimes horrible in linxu
<Sir_Leto>	*linux
<viscera>	socomm: why do you hate on other people's software choices?
<socomm>	viscera: Because!
<Sir_Leto>	socomm: 12 year olds are not allowed on our servers
<ayecee>	the age verification checks are strict. the user has to identify the correct orientation of a VHS tape
<Sir_Leto>	lol
<viscera>	ayecee: holes down, floppy bit forward? ;
<socomm>	Sir_Leto: Don't ask don't tell.
<Sir_Leto>	I need to ask my nephew if he's ever seen a VCR
<viscera>	;)
<pingfloyd>	that kind of age verification system would actually work better
<DanMan01001>	lol floppy bit
<Sir_Leto>	My nephew is 13, what are the odds...
<Sir_Leto>	He's probably only ever seen DVDs
<Sir_Leto>	Pretty soon kids wont even know what CDs are
<Froolap>	or albums and a 45 will only be a gun.
<Sir_Leto>	Records haven't died because of hipsters/ "audiophiles"
<Sir_Leto>	Next time you build a PC, don't bother with a disk drive, you might need it once in the next 2 or 3 years you use it
<MetaNova>	Sir_Leto: I have a USB floppy drive I purchased for my laptop
<ayecee>	optical disk drive, i guess
<Sir_Leto>	why?
<socomm>	CDs will be the new vinyl.
<socomm>	OMG CDs so much better than MP3s.
<ayecee>	scratches and everything
<Froolap>	sadly, i just threw away two of my laptops
<iflema>	lols @ socomm
<Sir_Leto>	speaking of floppy drives, I saw a post on reddit that shows someone connecting a floppydrive to an android phone with an OTG cable
<Sir_Leto>	the kernel still has support for them
<socomm>	Minecraft, Reddit.
<socomm>	This place keeps getting better.
<Sir_Leto>	Reddit does major search engine manupulation
<Sir_Leto>	they are a huge influence on the internet
<socomm>	Sir_Leto: Cool.
<viscera>	actually the reason i want to run minecraft is because some guy made this philosophy "flowchart" that you walk through
<viscera>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgEXEfI_SS0
<viscera>	also, reddit is awesome
<stevecam>	this is mega strange, i just inserted a flash drive and it was located at 1.7, i re-plugged it and now it's 1.25
<MetaNova>	located at?
<socomm>	Isn't reddit a watered down 'something awful'/'4chan'?
<viscera>	depends on which subreddits you read
<aliendude5300>	I'm upgrading my workstation -- I built the thing in 2012 and it has a 240GB SSD on an ASUS P8Z77-V Deluxe motherboard. I want (a lot) more storage but don't want to sacrifice the speed of the system or the compatibility with Fedora 21 (my OS of choice). I want to get a 512GB M.2 PCI express drive for boot and I want to build an SSD RAID 5 storage array with 4 1TB SSD drives. The problem is that I only have 4 SATA 3Gbps por
<aliendude5300>	ts, and 2 SATA 6 Gbps ports. I need a hardware RAID controller. What would work well with my setup and support Linux out of the box?
<socomm>	I don't use reddit. It just seems like a lot of uninformed people.
<socomm>	aliendude5300: Why RAID 5?
<spillere>	i have files like O Mundo Segundo Os Brasileiros [Angola]720p By Ops.mkv, I want to make a bash script to get the name of the files from [NAME] and rename it as NAME.MKV, any help?
<socomm>	Also 1TB SSDs?
<aliendude5300>	socomm: Because unlike RAID 0 one drive can fail and I won't lose everything and unlike RAID 1 I'm not losing half my capacity
<socomm>	spillere: You must likely are gonna need to use sed or awk. I'd start by asking on #bash.
<spillere>	socomm thank
<aliendude5300>	and 1TB SSDs because they're pretty great -- I can get quite a lot of performance and speed out of them. I want my system to be lightning fast :)
<socomm>	aliendude5300: Remember there is a write penalty with associated with RAID 5.
<socomm>	Also remember SSDs have finite writes.
<aliendude5300>	Even with 4+ drives?
<socomm>	And some RAID controllers don't have TRIM support.
<aliendude5300>	Everything has finite writes, but newer SSDs can handle quite a bit of writes
<aliendude5300>	That's definitely a concern
<socomm>	So ....... things to take into consideration when specing your build out.
<aliendude5300>	The TRIM is the most concerning
<socomm>	aliendude5300: I'm not sure if soft RAID supports TRIM, if it does you can go that route.
<aliendude5300>	I'm definitely going with at least an M.2 PCI-E SSD with 512GB for a boot drive, but as far as storage goes, I was hoping to go full SSD for that sweet, sweet speed.
<aliendude5300>	I already have the whole system built, and just need to re-do the storage
<aliendude5300>	Unfortunately I can only put 2 SSDs on a SATA 6 port on my motherboard
*	szr- is now known as szr
<aliendude5300>	This is what I'm working with: http://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/P8Z77V_DELUXE/
<socomm>	aliendude5300: You could always set-up a NAS. You know that way all your devices can take advantage of this new fangled storage.
<aliendude5300>	I would prefer local storage, and my current 240GB Corsair SSD is not nearly enough space for that
<socomm>	aliendude5300: It doesn't seem to have onboard RAID.
<aliendude5300>	The motherboard does have on board raid. On SATA 3Gbps (x4) ports: Support Raid 0, 1, 5, 10 -- useless with SSD though, and on SATA 6Gbps ports (x2): Support Raid 0, 1
<socomm>	aliendude5300: Is that softraid controller?
<aliendude5300>	That's using the Intel Z77 chipset
<aliendude5300>	whatever that uses, it's built-in
<aliendude5300>	I'm pretty sure I need a dedicated RAID controller, and if I'm about to drop $2.5k on SSDs, the price of the RAID controller isn't too important as long as it works well with Linux out of the box.
<socomm>	You're gonna drop 2.5k on local storage?
<aliendude5300>	I'd really like to avoid using 4 SATA 3Gbps ports for RAID with SSDs. That would be horribly slow
<socomm>	That's a bit much, in my book.
<socomm>	But then again, I'm broke as a bad tail light.
<aliendude5300>	I'm definitely spending around 500 on one of these: http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SM951-512GB-AHCI-MZHPV512HDGL-00000/dp/B00VELDBJ6/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1431844142&sr=8-4
<Sir_Leto>	Can you realistically get 3Gbps?
<aliendude5300>	Pretty much every SSD nearly hits 6Gbps
<aliendude5300>	Wonder why they all cap out at 550M? That's just the bottleneck of the interface
<iflema>	mini pci-e is only 5 i fink
<iflema>	sata 3 adapter that is
<aliendude5300>	from Amazon's site, people are getting 2.24 GB/s Read &1.6 GB/s Write
<aliendude5300>	I'm not using the SATA 3 adapter with the M.2 drive, I'm using a PCI express 3 x4 to M.2 adapter
<aliendude5300>	I will easily be able to get the full speed of that interface, that's not the issue
<iflema>	just saying
<iflema>	/s/saying/trollin
<aliendude5300>	I've got one of these in the mail already I'll use for the new boot drive: http://www.tweaktown.com/reviews/6422/addonics-adm2px4-pcie-3-0-to-m-2-ssd-adapter-review/index.html
<aliendude5300>	Still looking for a RAID controller to use with my other storage
<socomm>	Don't they have SSDs that plug into the RAM slots now?
<aliendude5300>	There's no way that's a thing
<socomm>	http://www.sandisk.com/enterprise/ulltradimm-ssd/
<zerowaitstate>	they do, but they're expensive
<socomm>	aliendude5300: Man of little faith.
<zerowaitstate>	they are designed to bypass the PCI bus
<zerowaitstate>	I believe
<aliendude5300>	Okay, so if I put an SSD in my RAM slot, I'll have really slow RAM that quickly wears out?
<socomm>	They sit closer to the processor, so you get better throughput.
<aliendude5300>	What?
<zerowaitstate>	on many systems the PCI bridge can't keep up with faster flash storage
<zerowaitstate>	hence the reason they move it to the RAM bus instead
<socomm>	aliendude5300: Follow the link. They explain the whole thing there.
<aliendude5300>	Either way all my RAM slots are populated (4 x 4 GB), so I couldn't use that
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: unless you are doing HFT or something, there's no reason currently to get something like that
<socomm>	HFT?
<socomm>	I'm guessing high frequency trading.
<zerowaitstate>	quite
<aliendude5300>	No reason to get 16 GB RAM?
<aliendude5300>	or 4 SSDs?
<zerowaitstate>	no reason to get a flash storage array on the memory bus
<aliendude5300>	Ah, yes.
<zerowaitstate>	that's mostly for running fast transactional databases, where you need super fast commits
<aliendude5300>	I really wish Red Hat would publish a list of RAID controllers that don't require additional software at all in Fedora 21
<socomm>	http://www.violin-memory.com/
<socomm>	I wonder what this means for disk paging.
<socomm>	If ever storage is as fast or faster than memory would we even need memory?
<zerowaitstate>	socomm: they are probably using PCI flash storage cards
<socomm>	zerowaitstate: Not talking about this specific vendor.
<zerowaitstate>	socomm: its a cost thing. non-volatile RAM exists, but it's expensive.
<zerowaitstate>	socomm: the reason for volatile RAM is that it's cheap
<socomm>	zerowaitstate: I'm aware why RAM exists. But jsut thinking outloud.
<socomm>	I'm sure we'll see affordable flash cards that sit in RAM slots in the next 5-7 years.
<zerowaitstate>	socomm: what you would have in that case is storage that is addressable in virtual memory, as in memory mapped files. only your entire storage would be memory mapped
<zerowaitstate>	socomm: in that case paging probably wouldn't be necessary
<aliendude5300>	does anyone know if modern LSI controllers "just work" on Linux?
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: i'm pretty sure they do, but if you want to manage the RAID you need to download their agent to do it
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: i've used an LSI MegaRAID under RHEL, and I had to use the tools from LSI to get notifications of down drives, etc.
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: that was RHEL 6
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: it worked pretty well; I don't have any complaints
<aliendude5300>	hmm, well would it at least work as a storage device without the agent? Like say I have 6 1TB drives in RAID 5, would I see a continuous 5TB block?
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: yeah, it works
<aliendude5300>	what model number?
<zerowaitstate>	the agent is for monitoring and config only
<zerowaitstate>	I don't recall. It was a model from 3 years ago
<zerowaitstate>	check LSI's site. they tell you if they've tested against a particular kernel iirc
<aliendude5300>	hopefully not much changed
<aliendude5300>	their support matrix hasn't been updated since fedora 12
<socomm>	Why fedora over centos?
<aliendude5300>	I like it more, I'm running it on a workstation system, not a server
<socomm>	I'm not a big fan of Fedora.
<aliendude5300>	 why not?
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: bah, lsi apparently got bought by avago, and their website sucks now
<socomm>	Their website has always sucked.
<PaulePanter>	Hi. Does anyone know how to map the entries in /sys/devices/virtual/bdi/ to a particular device?
<aliendude5300>	Correct me if I'm wrong, but one SFF-8087 mini-SAS port = 4 SATA ports with an adapter?
<PaulePanter>	BDI is the backing device interface.
<socomm>	Time for bed.
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: yeah, go to LSI's site, go to the product, look at documentation, then go to the OS support matrix
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: fedora is listed there (older versions since it was written in 2010)
<aliendude5300>	I'm looking at this because it explicitly states linux support: http://ark.intel.com/products/60282/Intel-Integrated-RAID-Module-RMT3PB080
<aliendude5300>	only $450 as well
<zerowaitstate>	http://www.lsi.com/downloads/Public/RAID%20Controllers/RAID%20Controllers%20Common%20Files/MegaRAID_SAS_6G_OS_Support_list.pdf
<aliendude5300>	hmm, might not be pci-express though
<aliendude5300>	no, it says PCIe x8 gen 2
<PaulePanter>	Ah, `ls -l /dev` shows the major and minor number.
<PaulePanter>	http://www.makelinux.net/ldd3/chp-3-sect-2
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: lsi has instructions here for their newer 12 Gb/s models: http://www.lsi.com/downloads/Public/RAID%20Controllers/RAID%20Controllers%20Common%20Files/MR_SAS_Device_Driver_Install_UserGd_RevQ.pdf
<aliendude5300>	Would I really need 12Gb/s even with SATA SSDs? I doubt the ssd controller even supports that interface
<zerowaitstate>	http://www.lsi.com/downloads/Public/RAID%20Controllers/RAID%20Controllers%20Common%20Files/MR_SAS_Device_Driver_Install_UserGd_RevQ.pdf
<zerowaitstate>	ah, it's the same doc
<zerowaitstate>	anyway, the procedure is the same for older models as well
<xeon-enouf>	PaulePanter: no idea, but is /Documentation/bcache.txt something helpful? I haven't even noticed /sys/devices/virtual/bdi/ before, heh
<xeon-enouf>	dell perc controllers are also LSI-branded, mostly, IINM
<zerowaitstate>	xeon-enouf: yeah, but dell perc controllers sometimes run special firmware to reject non-dell drives
<zerowaitstate>	xeon-enouf: but otherwise, yeah, it's the same chip
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: there's also HP SmartArray, if you like spending a lot of money for the same thing
<aliendude5300>	Why would I want to do that lol
<zerowaitstate>	for the privilege of owning HP mainly
<bullgard4>	xeon-enouf: What is the UnIX group nogroup» for in Debian? I have found so far: "http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch12.en.html#s-faq-os-users: "Default user = daemons that need not own any files run as user nobody and group nogroup. Thus, no files on a system should be owned by this user or group." --
<zerowaitstate>	every server I've seen that wasn't Dell or HP ran LSI controllers
<xeon-enouf>	zerowaitstate: ouch
<zerowaitstate>	the HP's aren't bad until you start paying for licenses to unlock certain firmware features.
<aliendude5300>	Looking at the LSI MegaRAID 9260-8i, would that support TRIM? Also, what does the 512MB mean? Is that the maximum HDD cache?
<xeon-enouf>	bullgard4: i know it uses the nobody user:group for some /etc/cron.*/* files, for example, updatedb and (/etc/cron.daily/locate)
<SkunkyFone>	bullgard4: some things, like, say, apache, you configure to run as nobody, so they have no rights to the filesystem
<zerowaitstate>	my favorite is the add-on that enables secure erase
<xeon-enouf>	bullgard4: SkunkyFone just said it better than i
<pingfloyd>	zerowaitstate: that's probably the caches in the controller
<bullgard4>	SkunkyFone: Thank you for explaining.
<pingfloyd>	aliendude5300: ^
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: yeah, that's the write cache on the controller
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: you also need to make sure you get the BBU. It doesn't automatically come with it
<pingfloyd>	some of the controller have a battery too in case of power failure to protect the filesystem
<aliendude5300>	A lot of LSI controllers like the 9271-8i support 128 drives. That feels like a hell of a lot of overkill.
<aliendude5300>	Do I need the BBU for the unit to operate normally?
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: no, but if you want to make sure writes get committed to disk if power is cut to the pc/server, then you need it
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: generally, if people are willing to invest in RAID, they also need to get BBU
<aliendude5300>	This looks promising http://www.esaitech.com/lsi-megaraid-9260-8i-512mb-ddr2-800mhz-6.0gbps-pci-express-2.0-low-profile-ready-sas-sata-raid-controller-card.html?pk_campaign=ga-pla&gclid=Cj0KEQjw-OCqBRDXmIWvveLE3_cBEiQAZWfImSEkDRFwwp7QmIAbzvjOVdBkCQMVYmOMQpIszaZh_28aAndz8P8HAQ
<xeon-enouf>	bullgard4: but sure, going via the definition you posted - it allows for system chores to be run, without the need for the user:group to own any files, therefore attempting to lock down, as best as possible, those daemons that require elevated privileges (it's basically as if you had assigned specific scripts/commands to be run, for a particular user:group in /etc/sudoers)
<pingfloyd>	the bbu will preserve what hasn't been flushed to disk
<xeon-enouf>	bullgard4: but on a system maintenance system, handled via the package manager too
<pingfloyd>	so your filesystem is consistent when it comes back up
<aliendude5300>	The BBU is more expensive than the RAID controller I'm looking at
<xeon-enouf>	er bullgard4 ; system maintenance "schedule", i meant
<pingfloyd>	if the data is important, you should get it
<aliendude5300>	Could I just get one of these instead? http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16842102048&nm_mc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-PC&cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-PC-_-pla-_-UPS-_-N82E16842102048&gclid=Cj0KEQjw-OCqBRDXmIWvveLE3_cBEiQAZWfImRPr56_XGrq91GQsuWNNIOql1vQLwcRv_036dc0KUOsaAuCA8P8HAQ&gclsrc=aw.ds
<pingfloyd>	like where you store important records
<bullgard4>	xeon-enouf: Thank you.
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: unless it is a double conversion UPS, and you have dual redundant power supplies in the server/workstation, I would get a BBU
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: that UPS is a line-interactive UPS, not double-conversion
<xeon-enouf>	bullgard4: not sure the doc you posted has the exact same info found in /usr/share/doc/base-passwd/users-and-groups.* or not, perhaps review --- ok, welcome
<aliendude5300>	how long does a BBU last?
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: long enough to flush changes to disk
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: and that's all you need
<zerowaitstate>	it will last as long as the controller
<zerowaitstate>	i've seen them go bad in controllers that are like 7-8 years old
<aliendude5300>	pretty much all the reviews on the newegg one say it only lasts a year and a half or so
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: huh?
<aliendude5300>	That seems like a really cruddy component
<zerowaitstate>	BBU's last a pretty long time in my experience
<aliendude5300>	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16816118118&nm_mc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-PC&cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-PC-_-pla-_-Server+Accessories-_-N82E16816118118&gclid=Cj0KEQjw-OCqBRDXmIWvveLE3_cBEiQAZWfImTy1xIRnlEV_U4QhSPfs6LkUzmHocY_nHxtopsuTSp4aAsLl8P8HAQ&gclsrc=aw.ds
<aliendude5300>	that's the one compatible with the 9260-8i I'm looking at
<aliendude5300>	How likely is it that I'll lose data without a BBU in a power outage? If so, how much? Just what hasn't finished writing to disk, right?
<pingfloyd>	aliendude5300: is it a database server?
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: I would advise not buying it through newegg
<aliendude5300>	no
<pingfloyd>	is restoring from backup a big deal?
<pingfloyd>	like a big loss if you have to resort to that
<aliendude5300>	I won't be putting my OS on my RAID, so no matter what I should be able to boot even if I lose the entire RAID. I expect worst case I'll lose a few user files
<pingfloyd>	the other approach is to put more stock into your UPS being able to gracefully shutdown when needed.
<pingfloyd>	if there's no critical data involved, I wouldn't worry about bbu too much
<jd1>	ssds or hdds?
<pingfloyd>	I think many raid controller won't allow you to enable write caching without it though
<spreeuw>	if you dont have alot of writes
<zerowaitstate>	pingfloyd: that's correct. on the LSI board write caching is disabled if there is no BBU
<aliendude5300>	I'm planning to have 4 SSDs, but I might consider HDDs to save money
<spreeuw>	theres little chance of corruption anyway
<pingfloyd>	that's a good point, it comes more into matter if there is a lot of writes like on a server with a sizable load
<pingfloyd>	*mattering
<spreeuw>	writes to scattered little files make it even more robust
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: in my experience with 4 SSD's the RAID controller becomes the bottleneck
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: at least with RAID 10
<spreeuw>	whats pcie bus bw ?
<spreeuw>	4x ssd is easily 2000MB/s
<zerowaitstate>	spreeuw: well, it's more that the RAID controller can't push enough IOPS
<pingfloyd>	IOPS is also such a doctored metric
<zerowaitstate>	I had one with 8 crucial m2 ssd's in it, and it slowed the drives down considerably
<zerowaitstate>	pingfloyd: transactions/sec, whatever
<pingfloyd>	zerowaitstate: I'm just saying
<spreeuw>	how about softraid
<zerowaitstate>	spreeuw: softraid blows chunks
<pingfloyd>	the manufacturers like to doctor that metric
<pingfloyd>	and are purposely misleading with it
*	one1_ is now known as one1
<pingfloyd>	softraid is fine for certain applications
<pingfloyd>	having a controller can be overkill in some cases
<zerowaitstate>	the one thing I like about softraid is that it's actually possible to manually get in and repair stuff.
<pingfloyd>	it always comes down to application
<annihilannic>	softraid is almost as good as hard when it's raid1.. it's when it's raid5 that the difference is massive
<pingfloyd>	and that it is available practically everywhere
<pingfloyd>	that's not a bad plus
<spreeuw>	yeah I loves it
<pingfloyd>	can't knock free raid too bad
<zerowaitstate>	linux mdraid has gotten a lot better
<pingfloyd>	and it's not very hard on the cpu either
<annihilannic>	I've been using vxvm for many years and think it's great
<[Steven_M]>	Are funtoo and gentoo the only rolling-release distro's that don't force you to use systemd?
<zerowaitstate>	what about slackware?
<aliendude5300>	Is software raid even a viable option at all for me? I'm going to be using a super fast m.2 ssd via PCIe 3 x4 as a boot drive, and the rest of my SSDs will be storage in RAID 5 (4x 1TB). I'm probably going to just use the volume as the /home mountpoint
<pingfloyd>	kind of raises gentoo's stock
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	So I have a dumb problem: I have a machine connected directly to my machine via an Ethernet cord; and I need its IP address.
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	(raspberry pi, first time I'm playing with one)
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: software raid is a lot easier to deal with if you aren't having to boot from it
<aliendude5300>	ELLIOTTCABLE, wait, you have your desktop plugged into your r pi?
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	yep
<pingfloyd>	crossover cable?
<aliendude5300>	Check ifconfig in the terminal
<aliendude5300>	see what comes up
<goawayrain2>	hello, is there any software that will automatically scan for any issues in fedora and fix them?
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	well, I mean, I know my *own* IP
<pingfloyd>	ELLIOTTCABLE: you want a crossover cable unless they have auto-mdix
<annihilannic>	ELLIOTTCABLE: Do you have a screen and keyboard attached to the Pi?
<pingfloyd>	or throw a switch between them
<zerowaitstate>	ELLIOTTCABLE: I doubt the interface on the other side has an IP address
<zerowaitstate>	ELLIOTTCABLE: most of the time the eth0 is configured to get its address from DHCP by default
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	I've never owned a crossover cable in my life; but idk networking things. I use OS X as desktops, and I've always been able to simply connect two when I want to transfer files quickly; this is my first time trying to connect to a Linux locally like this.
<aliendude5300>	zerowaitstate, what's the difference between the Z77 chipset RAID and software raid in terms of performance? With true software raid I might be able to get all 4 drives on SATA 6 even though they are not on the same controller
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	annihilannic: if i did, this would be trivial :P
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	but I don't own anything with HDMI, so …
<[Steven_M]>	zerowaitstate: where you answering me?
<annihilannic>	zerowaitstate: he could set up a DHCP daemon on his end I guess
<zerowaitstate>	ELLIOTTCABLE: you can run a tiny dhcp server on your comp to assign an address out over that interface, though :)
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	trying to get to the point where I can ssh in.
<pingfloyd>	ELLIOTTCABLE: you can make a crossover cable if you have the parts
<pingfloyd>	ELLIOTTCABLE: it's simply a difference in wiring
<annihilannic>	I think most modern NICs handle uncrossed cables now
<jd1>	til
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	oooooo mmkay
<pingfloyd>	annihilannic: he hasn't answered if his nic support auto-mdix
<[Steven_M]>	zerowaitstate: re slackware.
<pingfloyd>	*nics
<pingfloyd>	really, don't you have a switch?
<annihilannic>	pingfloyd: indeed, would be nice to have it in writing
<aliendude5300>	If I look at the specs of my motherboard at http://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/P8Z77V_DELUXE/specifications/ I see I have 4 SATA 6 (although they are on 2 different controllers) and 4 SATA 3 ports
<zerowaitstate>	ELLIOTTCABLE: what OS is running on your desktop
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	success!
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	zerowaitstate: OS X.
<pingfloyd>	get a little 4 port switch at least
<aliendude5300>	Could I use software RAID to set up a RAID 5 type deal with 4 1TB SSDs and not take a massive performance hit
<Hunterkll>	depends on your CPU
<Hunterkll>	and friends don't let friends use RAID-5
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	Discovered that enabling OS X's strange “Internet Sharing” service in the gui, boots up a n internal DHCP server on that interface.
<Hunterkll>	RAID-6 or bust.
<annihilannic>	aliendude5300: I'd highly discourage you from using software RAID5 if you value your write speeds.
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: with RAID5 the CPU has to calculate parity on all disk writes
<Hunterkll>	ELLIOTTCABLE, well how else do you expect internet sharing to work?
<Hunterkll>	ELLIOTTCABLE, the clients need to have an address on the sharing interface.
<annihilannic>	ELLIOTTCABLE: Good guess.
<aliendude5300>	I just want 4TB of reliable SSD storage (not used for boot -- using M.2 SSD over PCIe for that). What would be the best way to do that without RAID 5?
<Hunterkll>	aliendude5300, RAID-6
<aliendude5300>	wouldn't that need more drives?
<Hunterkll>	well, okay, with SSD RAID-5 /may/ be acceptable. but i still wouldn't trust it.
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	Hunterkll: No idea; the very idea of ‘sharing’ a network is really foreign to me.
<annihilannic>	aliendude5300: Well you aren't gonna get 4TB with RAID5 anyway.
<pingfloyd>	doesn't raid 5 have better write performance than raid 6?
<annihilannic>	aliendude5300: If you want performance and redundancy, just do RAID10
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	Ask me to write a programming language? Trivial. Ask me to explain what the fuck a subnet mask is? I'll run away crying and cower in a corner.
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	>,>
<Hunterkll>	ELLIOTTCABLE, sharing = dhcp clients on your side, then you NAT to those clients, while routing.
<Hunterkll>	you become a router
<Hunterkll>	the clients behind you need addresses.
<aliendude5300>	true. raid 5 would be 3tb..
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	yeah, that's kinda what I'd intuited
<aliendude5300>	and raid 10 would reduce it to 2 tb
<annihilannic>	RAID6 is multiple parity drives isn't it?  Only useful if you have lots of drives in your RAID, say 8+?
<Hunterkll>	.... no
<aliendude5300>	I feel like that's a huge waste of space/money
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	is there no way for the my-computer-as-a-router thing to act as a bridge, mapping multiple ports from the parent router?
<Hunterkll>	annihilannic, in spinning disk drives, you lose 2 drives
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	or am I imagining that that's even a thing
<Hunterkll>	in raid-5, you lose 1
<annihilannic>	aliendude5300: But you bought SSDs, which implies you value performance over space.
<Hunterkll>	ELLIOTTCABLE, bridging interfaces while having an addrses is tricky
<spreeuw>	what are you storing on that much space anyway
<zerowaitstate>	ELLIOTTCABLE: you just need to connect the r-pi to your home internet router if you want to do that
<spreeuw>	movies for other people
<annihilannic>	Hunterkll: Why only spinning drives?
<Hunterkll>	annihilannic, i was going to explain /why/ it's valuble
<aliendude5300>	I didn't buy the SSDs yet. I'm planning on it though. I only bought the M.2 boot SSD
<zerowaitstate>	ELLIOTTCABLE: then check the router management page to see the address assignment
<Hunterkll>	RAID-6 gives you two disk loss tolerance
<Hunterkll>	RAID-5 gives you one disk loss tolerance.
<annihilannic>	ELLIOTTCABLE: That's what connection sharing should do, depends what features the OS X sharing thingy has.
<Hunterkll>	in spinning disk world, rebuild stress can cause drive failures
<Hunterkll>	if you only hav eone drive tolerance, and receive another failure during rebuild
<spreeuw>	can softraid do raidZ yet?
<Hunterkll>	then you've lost the array
<Hunterkll>	spreeuw, on a real OS, sure. :P
<zerowaitstate>	ELLIOTTCABLE: then you can use your home internet router's port forwarding if you need that.
<pingfloyd>	but raid 5 has better performance
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	zerowaitstate: I'm surprised that the only way to do this is to open some thingamajig's proprietary GUI.
<annihilannic>	Hunterkll: Yes, that's true, but in a 4-disk array, the risk of losing two drives is highly reduced, and there's no point wasting two drives for parity when you can just use RAID10 and get as much space out of it.
<pingfloyd>	so the question is if you need better fault tolerance or better performance
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	There's really no simple command-line tool to get information like this?
<Hunterkll>	annihilannic, did you buy all the drives at the same time?
<pingfloyd>	which is more important in this case?
<zerowaitstate>	ELLIOTTCABLE: get information like what?
<Hunterkll>	annihilannic, and you're right on the RAID-10 count by the way - that's my preffered mode.
<aliendude5300>	I'm seriously considering just having 4 different 1TB volumes mounted at /ssd/1...4 at this point :/ this is way too complicated
<annihilannic>	Hunterkll: I'm not the one with the question ;-)
<Hunterkll>	I run about 70TB of hot storage at home
<Hunterkll>	I use LTO-4 for backups. AT HOME.
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	I mean, the router obviously knows; I imagine there has to be a simple way to query the DHCP server that's running on my machine now, as to what addresses it's given out. right?
<Hunterkll>	I know some storage. :)
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	I dunno, probably outside the territory of this room, now, though. thxmacosx.
<aliendude5300>	what is LTO-4?
<Hunterkll>	I've got a rack unit here with native U320, SATA, *AND* SAS drives. :D
<Hunterkll>	aliendude5300, TAPE
<Hunterkll>	tape backup
<zerowaitstate>	ELLIOTTCABLE: I don't get why your using your comp as a router when you can just use an actual router instead
<aliendude5300>	ah
<annihilannic>	Hunterkll: Part of my job is SAN array performance testing... I know some storage too ;-)
<Hunterkll>	800GB native, 1.6TB assuming 2:1 compression. :P
<Hunterkll>	annihilannic, you do SAN work and don't know LTO? :P
<Hunterkll>	where do you think your SAN data gets backed up to? :P
<annihilannic>	Hunterkll: You're confusing me with aliendude5300.
<Hunterkll>	goddamnit
<zerowaitstate>	there must be some way outta here
<zerowaitstate>	said the joker to the thief
<zerowaitstate>	there's too much confusion
<zerowaitstate>	i can't get no relief
<Hunterkll>	annihilannic, i'm that asshole who does 4K realtime transcoding, editing, and storing, and maxes out 8g fiberchannel links, on a $50 IDE fiberchannel array ... >_>
<Hunterkll>	haha
<annihilannic>	zerowaitstate: Pass it to the left.
<aliendude5300>	Since both of you "know storage", what's my best bet for very fast workstation storage (assuming I already have an M.2 PCIe SSD and just want to store data on fast media in a RAID)?
<Hunterkll>	.... like I said, 70TB live at home on free or nearly free hardware :D
<Hunterkll>	aliendude5300, seriously? Do you need performance or ...?
<Hunterkll>	not seriously as in are you serious
<Hunterkll>	as in what do you /need/
<aliendude5300>	I prefer speed
<aliendude5300>	I have a blazing fast boot drive in the mail right now
<Hunterkll>	okay
<Hunterkll>	what is your storage for
<aliendude5300>	and am looking for something for reasonably fast storage for /home/ so I can do work on that
<Hunterkll>	eh
<Hunterkll>	$350/drive on amazon for 850 EVO 1TB
<Hunterkll>	RAID-10 'em with good 'cold' backups
<Hunterkll>	but that's only if you get a decent hardware raid controller
<aliendude5300>	That's what I was thinking about -- $350 x 4 and put it in RAID 5
<Hunterkll>	an x8 that can actually pump the performance
<Hunterkll>	otherwise you're just getting shit
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	ahhhhh shit. now like 10,000 addresses are in my `arp` output.
<Hunterkll>	aliendude5300, softraid's gonna constrain your performance to the sata controller
<Hunterkll>	really
<Hunterkll>	otherwise
<Hunterkll>	don't worry about performance
<Hunterkll>	in softraid it's gonna be CPU and ram
<Hunterkll>	and you'll still be constrained by the crap sata controller on your motherboard, probably
<Hunterkll>	in real world terms: you're over thinking it without thinking interconnects.
<Hunterkll>	the same SSD on one connection gets 500MB/sec
<Hunterkll>	on another, 2.5GB/sec
<Hunterkll>	I've pushed 800MB/sec on a RAID-10 of rotational drives.
<aliendude5300>	RAID 10'll give me 2TB of storage for $1400 worth of drives, but RAID 5 gives me most of that storage with a slight performance hit.
<aliendude5300>	>  800MB/sec on a RAID-10 of rotational drives
<Hunterkll>	aliendude5300, if you're concerned about storage space, don't go SSD.
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: it's more than slight
<aliendude5300>	That's faster than the SSDs I'm looking at now
<Hunterkll>	aliendude5300, it's also 8 drives on an x8 connected pcie raid controller.
<Hunterkll>	a *real* RAID controller.
<tolland>	I've added my user to the dialout group to get access to the USB, but now I need to relogin. Is there a way to get another login shell with the correct groups without logging out?
<aliendude5300>	Let's say I go the rotational route and just buy a ton of 4TB caviar greens and a RAID controller, would that be better?
<jelly>	aliendude5300: what is "speed"?  Is your workload dealing with reads?  Writes?  Single streams?  random io?
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	zerowaitstate: my router's in a closet in another room under a bunch of shit. and probably approximately two gallons of dead skin.
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	:P
<Hunterkll>	aliendude5300, 'better' depends on your needs
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	I can do this on the couch.
<Hunterkll>	you haven't ever once defined your needs.
<[Steven_M]>	Are funtoo and gentoo the only rolling-release distro's that don't force you to use systemd?
<zerowaitstate>	ELLIOTTCABLE: i threw up in my mouth a little bit
<Hunterkll>	other than 'fast storage'
<ELLIOTTCABLE>	rather spend an hour dicking around with local dhcp servers than get off the couch and find the physical router. #lazydeveloperproblems
<aliendude5300>	general computing, development, testing things in VMs, amateur video editing, etc
<aliendude5300>	Primarily looking for great workstation performance but will use it for general computing as well
<Hunterkll>	aliendude5300, there's no way in hell you need multiple SSDs for that shit
<zerowaitstate>	^
<Hunterkll>	Fuck, I run 15+ VMs on my laptop with two rotational non-RAID drives in it.
<Hunterkll>	(Laptop does have 32G ram ... )
<aliendude5300>	at once? Jesus, that's a hell of a laptop
<aliendude5300>	That's better than some servers from like 2006
<Hunterkll>	aliendude5300, *shrug*. 32G ram, i7 quad, etc
<Hunterkll>	....
*	Hunterkll glances at the 2950 III handling higher density.
<Hunterkll>	nope, nope it's not.
<Hunterkll>	shit, half my storage is 32bit xeons. hah
<Hunterkll>	https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=9805c9c8f4699b!244933&authkey=!AGilXgukXZ3E0gs&v=3&ithint=photo%2cjpg
<Hunterkll>	the bedroom setup ;)
<aliendude5300>	So you're saying I'm better off going with tons of rotational storage in RAID 10?
<Hunterkll>	I mean
<Hunterkll>	you've said nothign that warrants SSD for bulk storage
<Hunterkll>	seriously.
<Hunterkll>	and, since it hasn't been mentioned yet
<Hunterkll>	RAID IS NOT A FUCKING BACKUP
<aliendude5300>	Why the hell do you have like 48 units worth of servers in your bedroom?
<tolland>	interesting... apparently "newgrp groupname" and then change back to the original primary group "newgrp oldgroup" has that effect.
<aliendude5300>	do you have three phase power at your house or something? lol
<Hunterkll>	aliendude5300, that's /just/ the bedroom.
<aliendude5300>	That must be REALLY loud
<Hunterkll>	oh, and the only SSDs int he house are in my mobile laptop.
<Hunterkll>	eh
<aliendude5300>	how the **** do you sleep with those on?
<Hunterkll>	only one of the 350s and the two 2950s are lit up
<Hunterkll>	aliendude5300, bro, i'm a professional sysadmin. alcohol, duh.
<Hunterkll>	nah. i'm just used to it
<Hunterkll>	and it's not that loud
<Hunterkll>	like i said, only 13U is lit up at night
<aliendude5300>	okay, now I need to know, what are you doing with that many servers in your house?
<Hunterkll>	.... home lab?
<aliendude5300>	what do you even test on them?
<aliendude5300>	like that seems like overkill
<aliendude5300>	maybe one or two and swapping the drives I can understand
<aliendude5300>	but a 52U rack?
<Hunterkll>	"swapping the drives"
<Hunterkll>	rightr
<Hunterkll>	like i want F)@#*%)@# downtime
<Hunterkll>	when i'm triple-homed with BGP
<Hunterkll>	when the family pisses me off I kill NAT and make 'em publicly routable for fun.
<Hunterkll>	>_<
<aliendude5300>	you're telling me you're running mission-critical servers in your home
<Hunterkll>	no
<Hunterkll>	note: "want"
<Hunterkll>	note: CRT next to rack.
<pingfloyd>	he lives in a datacenter
<Hunterkll>	just because my ipv6 is bigger than yours....
<hololeap>	you're on 3 different autonomous networks?
<Hunterkll>	Yes, I have proper peerage.
<hololeap>	sweet
<Hunterkll>	I spent a /stupid/ amount of money at one point ....
<Hunterkll>	thank god i got a real money job before renewals and renegotioations came up ...
<zerowaitstate>	Hunterkll: i like the old Sun workstation sitting next to the rack :)
<Hunterkll>	zerowaitstate, that's my OPENstep 4.2 workstation.]
<Hunterkll>	my main desktop is an E250
<Hunterkll>	zerowaitstate, i'll tell you what - you'll really love what's sitting next to the sun workstaiton.
<Hunterkll>	well, i'll let you find out - if you can
<zerowaitstate>	an SGI?
<Hunterkll>	feel free to dial in ... +1-410-734-6804
<zerowaitstate>	nah; i don't lower myself to dialup anymore :)
<Hunterkll>	dial in ... only.

<zerowaitstate>	LOL
<zerowaitstate>	I haven't seen one of those since I was a kid
<aliendude5300>	So I'm thinking... 6 4TB WD Caviar Greens with fully software (non-bios) RAID across both SATA 6 and SATA 3 interfaces. Any reason this is a stupid idea? It ought to be a bit more space than those SSDs, and with that many drives I assume I'll have a lot of aggregate bandwidth
<Hunterkll>	'ought to be'
<Hunterkll>	no
<Hunterkll>	it'll be a hell of a lot more space
<Stryyker>	Greens probably not a good idea
<Hunterkll>	also, why 6?
<Hunterkll>	and why one vendor?
<Hunterkll>	if you want /real/ drive security
<Hunterkll>	jesus
<Hunterkll>	at that small scale?
<Hunterkll>	1 drive from each vendor
<Hunterkll>	if that's not possible to get 6 drive vendors
<Stryyker>	Not a lot of choice for vendors
<Hunterkll>	you order one drive online
<Hunterkll>	and buy one locally
<aliendude5300>	why the hell would I mix and match vendors for a RAID setup
<zerowaitstate>	Hunterkll: quit messing with him
<Hunterkll>	different ages, different batches, etc
<Hunterkll>	aliendude5300, so that rebuild stress doesn't kill a drive that already failed from the same batch.
<Hunterkll>	zerowaitstate, you've never had an all-same batch/vendor raid array utterly collapse during rebuild? :D
<aliendude5300>	I'm not entirely sure you're not trolling me
<zerowaitstate>	Hunterkll: no
<sauvin>	He's not.
<jushur>	if a drive gona fail, it usually does so within a few h of actuall use...
<Hunterkll>	aliendude5300, the theory is - if they're all from the same batch
<Hunterkll>	and one already failed
<Hunterkll>	the rest are shortly soon to follow
<Hunterkll>	and rebuild is high stress on the drives
<Hunterkll>	"Disks fail, and you typically want to get them from different batches to be safe. Once you get them you still want to run them for a few days or weeks to be sure to shake loose the problem disks.
<Hunterkll>	"
<Hunterkll>	http://serverfault.com/questions/317355/should-you-still-spread-a-hard-drive-order-over-several-vendors
<jushur>	you dont destroy your old drives and its data because you buy new ones.. you keep the m as a backup.. anything else is stupid.
<Hunterkll>	huh?
<Hunterkll>	we weren't talking about trashing old drives...
<Hunterkll>	we were merely talking about the array
<Hunterkll>	i already made the RAID is not a backup point.
<Froolap>	I zero out my drives and remove the platters
<zerowaitstate>	personally, i eat my old drives with bbq sauce
<Hunterkll>	Froolap, shotgun is best drive eraser.
<jushur>	geting drives from diff batches actually wont help shit if you got bad hardware, as bad hardware tends to bring good hardware with them in the process.
<aliendude5300>	Aren't all the drives supposed to match in RAID?
<aliendude5300>	like be nearly identical
<Hunterkll>	jushur, okay, but in an optimal world, different batches will help
<Hunterkll>	aliendude5300, shit, my raid 10 on my hypervisors is 250G x 6
<Hunterkll>	but that's just because the smallest disk is 250G
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: they don't have to be identical
<Hunterkll>	there's 1T's in there because it was all I had to replace failures at the time
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: but getting drives that are too different tends to slow down the group to whatever the lowest denominator is
<aliendude5300>	This sounds completely crazy to me
<Hunterkll>	....
<Hunterkll>	sometimes, in the heat of the moment
<Hunterkll>	it's okay to go 250 to 1T
<Hunterkll>	>_>
<aliendude5300>	I mean a 1tb drive is only like $60
<aliendude5300>	so not a huge waste
<Hunterkll>	actually
<Hunterkll>	i rarely pay for drives
<Hunterkll>	i collect/salvage/etc
<zerowaitstate>	Hunterkll: how old are those HP servers in the bottom of the rack?
<Hunterkll>	zerowaitstate, some of my main storage! Gen 3's, 32 bit xeons.
<Hunterkll>	ML350 G3
<jelly>	that's 2002-3-ish
<zerowaitstate>	we had one of those. I think we had like a g4
<jushur>	i find it quite funny how often ppl get bad drives, considering ive had like none in my last 20years..
<aliendude5300>	gen 3 proliants? Those ought to be slow for much other than storage
<zerowaitstate>	painful on the back
<Hunterkll>	G4 was 64 bit
<jelly>	some G3 were 32bit, some 64bit
<Hunterkll>	aliendude5300, one's also in charge of some of the tape backup and VPN connectors and misc stuff like that
<aliendude5300>	You have an interesting and expensive hobby
<Hunterkll>	expensive?
<Hunterkll>	shit
<Hunterkll>	i prolly paid like, $200 for all the shit in that rack
<Hunterkll>	overall
<aliendude5300>	and what about networking and electricity?
<Hunterkll>	rack, HPs, 2950s, etc, were free
<Hunterkll>	networking?
<Hunterkll>	eh
<zerowaitstate>	aliendude5300: he's a proud owner of a great mass of depreciated iron
<Hunterkll>	cisco 3750s
<Hunterkll>	free
<Hunterkll>	Netgear managed switch, free
<Hunterkll>	upstream cisco for BGP, free
<Hunterkll>	Sonicwall NSA 240 for NAT/core/family firewall, free
<Hunterkll>	UPS gear, free
<Hunterkll>	electric: included in rent
<zerowaitstate>	ah ha
<zerowaitstate>	electric included in the rent
<Hunterkll>	basement 48 port gig manged switch? free
<zerowaitstate>	that's the secret
<Hunterkll>	managed 48 port SMC? free
<Hunterkll>	zerowaitstate, i mean, really, the bill only spikes to like $400 in summer with max AC and everything apparently
<Hunterkll>	and we're killing less than the others in the valley
<Hunterkll>	so we're probably losing out if we're killing less
<Hunterkll>	(fans and windows are awsome!)
<aliendude5300>	holy shit
<aliendude5300>	so much free stuff
<aliendude5300>	where do you even find it
<Hunterkll>	aliendude5300, hackerspaces, collector mailing lists, social networking (the meatspace kind), etc
<zerowaitstate>	if you live a tech town, you visit sales and junk
<annihilannic>	zerowaitstate: that would be 'deprecated'
<Hunterkll>	zerowaitstate, LOL i live north of baltimore ....
<zerowaitstate>	companies just dump that junk
<annihilannic>	Hunterkll: is that a sparcstation 5? 20?
<Hunterkll>	annihilannic, 5. with OPENstep 4.2
<zerowaitstate>	annihilannic: no, I meant depreciated
<Hunterkll>	Sol 9 on my Ultra 5, Sol 10 on my E250
<zerowaitstate>	annihilannic: but yeah, it's also deprecated
<Hunterkll>	E250 i smy main workhorse
<annihilannic>	zerowaitstate: I see what you mean ;-)
<_arprez_>	I can't access shared folder... workstation 11. .. 64bit win7 host.. 32bit fedora21 guest
<_arprez_>	.. H elp please
<annihilannic>	Hunterkll: I used to look after E10Ks... now all Linux
<Hunterkll>	annihilannic, I used to have two E450s :P
<Hunterkll>	great bedside tables
<annihilannic>	Hunterkll: yeah we had one of those... hehe perfect size
<Hunterkll>	(and file/datastore servers)
<annihilannic>	Hunterkll: and wheels too!
<Hunterkll>	seriously
<AncientLinuxoid>	Hi!
<zerowaitstate>	_arprez_: check vmware forums. you probably need to adjust some lines in the source code for the kernel module for host integration in vmware tools
<Hunterkll>	i had the 20 drive backplane
<Hunterkll>	it was AWSOME
<zerowaitstate>	_arprez_: every time a new kernel version comes out we have this situation with vmware
<Hunterkll>	40 drives running on a nice network when i was 17? hell yes.
<Hunterkll>	especially with 'em all 15K RPM
<_arprez_>	That is shit... btw I haven't updated the kernel on vm machine
<annihilannic>	Hunterkll: I used a decomm'd SS20 as my workstation for a couple of years... had one of those 8-drive JBODs.  Every time I powered it up I'd have to whack a couple of the drives on the side to get 'em to spin up :-)
<Hunterkll>	zerowaitstate, or he just can't be arsed to reinstall his modules. :P
<Hunterkll>	zerowaitstate, or he's doing it for the first time with no idea how to actually do it - hence his inability to provide any actual relevant info
<_arprez_>	Anyway any workaround this... I need opencv on it but I can't drag n drop the tar
<_arprez_>	It keeps messing up the tar size n proper copy
<Hunterkll>	_arprez_, upgrade to windows 8 and use hyper-v with a proper bridged interface if you must run a w indows host?
<annihilannic>	_arprez_: why not scp the tar onto it?
<zerowaitstate>	_arprez_: set the adatper on the vm to bridging mode, then use ssh/scp to copy it to the machine
<Hunterkll>	annihilannic, hmmmm i have one of the external arrays....
<Hunterkll>	i like the ultra 5 for it's IDE
<Hunterkll>	wish there was an OPENstep machine that could do IDE tho
<Hunterkll>	but there isn't :(
<_arprez_>	Ummhmm zerowaitstate
<annihilannic>	_arprez_: What hapens when you try to mount the shared folder anyway?
<_arprez_>	I have no udea about hyperv
<AncientLinuxoid>	What is your favourite distro?
<annihilannic>	Hunterkll: Not familiar iwth OPENstep...does it need the Ross CPUs or something?
<Hunterkll>	annihilannic, are you familiar with OS X?
<annihilannic>	Hunterkll: Not really ;-)  I heave heard of it though!
<Hunterkll>	so, tl;dr
<Hunterkll>	steve jobs got fired from apple
<AncientLinuxoid>	Steve Jobs died )
<Hunterkll>	steve jobs founds UNIX company called NeXT with awsome machines and an OS called NeXTstep
<zerowaitstate>	Hunterkll: wow, and I thought Wildcat BBS was old news...
<Hunterkll>	they move away from hardware to software, and make OPENstep
<Hunterkll>	runs on x86, POWER, PA_RISC, SPARC, etc
<Hunterkll>	NeXT gets "acquired" (steve jobs becomes CEO after NeXT is bought out and he replaces apple execs with NeXT exces)
<Hunterkll>	NeXTstep/OPENstpe becomes OS X
<Hunterkll>	if you ever program in OS X's regular environment, you'll notice most of the frameworks start with 'NS'
<Hunterkll>	NeXTstep ;)
<Hunterkll>	</history-lesson>
<annihilannic>	<applause/>
<zerowaitstate>	Hunterkll: yes, thank you Steve Jobs for Objective-C
<Hunterkll>	zerowaitstate, I like Obj-C
<zerowaitstate>	Hunterkll: I don't
<aliendude5300>	let's say you buy a lot of drives, how would you test them to make sure they are reliable?
<Hunterkll>	aliendude5300, burn in for a week and see if there's any failures
<AncientLinuxoid>	Hunterkll )
<Hunterkll>	after that, you're at the mercy of the batch's long term reliability
<zerowaitstate>	debugging Obj-C is a pita
<Hunterkll>	zerowaitstate, only if you're a n00b
<Hunterkll>	:P
<Hunterkll>	according to bash.org n00b is a nickname for microsoft programmers ... so....
<MetaNova>	well to be fair everything is painful when you're a noob
<Hunterkll>	well yea, you work for microsoft :P
<zerowaitstate>	actually most of my work lately is in Erlang
<Kardos>	good god linkedin is annoying, with its 2^90 popup windows
<Hunterkll>	.... you still sane?
<zerowaitstate>	quite
<Hunterkll>	i'd rather be in ...
<Hunterkll>	oh who kids anyone
<Hunterkll>	i do JCL for fun
<Hunterkll>	i'm /that guy/
<zerowaitstate>	my dad did JCL
<Hunterkll>	i'm still seeking down the s/360 card for my XT
<zerowaitstate>	then they fired him because nobody needs a guy that does JCL anymore
<Hunterkll>	.... and i'll see if i can make it work in my AT once I get my AT POSTing
<Hunterkll>	zerowaitstate, i can name a few agencies and companies who need JCL like a ... ..... scarlet woman needs antibiotics
<zerowaitstate>	Hunterkll: that would have been nice, because he worked at Walmart until he reached retirement. Seriously, from mainframe to Walmart
<Mayzie>	Hi guys. When trying to pipe the output of `sudo lspci -xxxx -vvvv' to a file, I get the following error 'pcilib: sysfs_read_vpd: read failed: Connection timed out'. However, if I do not pipe the output to a file, it prints everything into the terminal. What am I doing wrong?

<zerowaitstate>	Hunterkll: the only reason big companies go with IBM is the human touch, and they've lost that lately
<Hunterkll>	zerowaitstate, you have *no* idea Marriot's config/needs
<Hunterkll>	or amtrak's transactioanl througput
<Amun_Ra>	Hunterkll: I'm familiar with arexx (from good old amiga days)
<Hunterkll>	IBM Z hardware is the best for a reason.
<zerowaitstate>	Hunterkll: I'm not arguing that. But what sets IBM apart is the engineering support, or at least it used to
<Hunterkll>	zerowaitstate, for a Z system - it still is.
<Hunterkll>	for an AIX power system? you got it.
<Hunterkll>	linux? meh
<AncientLinuxoid>	BOO
<Hunterkll>	AncientLinuxoid, i'd support you more if linux's LVM wasn't a *less usable* clone of AIX's LVM
<annihilannic>	Hunterkll: HP-UX has a similarly less usable clone of LVM, what's its heritage?
<Hunterkll>	I never mentioned heritage.
<annihilannic>	Hunterkll: I haven't had the pleasure of AIX
<Hunterkll>	annihilannic, oh it's so bloody nice
<Hunterkll>	like
<Hunterkll>	on linux i can't be arsed to remember args of lvcreate, et al
<Hunterkll>	why can't i just say LVCREATE 50G
<Hunterkll>	and have that populate on the default pool?
<Hunterkll>	super-simplified example, but still
<Hunterkll>	(one of those cute things in ym bedroom rack is an RS/6000 :P )
<aliendude5300>	What are your feelings on 4x 6TB WD Red (because I don't think Caviar greens would be nearly as reliable) with RAID 10 storage set-up for 12 TB of usable space?
<Hunterkll>	aliendude5300, as long as you have good backups, that's where i'd go for the best cost/$/reliability ratio
<Hunterkll>	make sure you at least attempt to get each drive from a different source though
<Hunterkll>	to lessen rebuild death risk
<Hunterkll>	1 newegg, 1 best buy, 1 microcenter, 1 ..... yahoo?
<Hunterkll>	etc
<Hunterkll>	oh, and buy a spare - put it in as a hot spare
<Hunterkll>	so when a failure happens you don't a have to worry
<aliendude5300>	well I doubt that I'll be able to buy a 6tb wd red in best buy
<Hunterkll>	and make the hot spare a non-WD drive
<Hunterkll>	well
<Hunterkll>	it's the idea
<Hunterkll>	you know what i mean
<Hunterkll>	diversify as much as you can
<Hunterkll>	2/2 for sources would be fine *shrug*
<aliendude5300>	what are the chances that if I order 4 on amazon I'll get 4 from the same batch?
<aliendude5300>	really unlikely I assume
<Hunterkll>	hugely likely
<Hunterkll>	unless you buy from different marketplace sellers
<Hunterkll>	if you order straight from amazon
<Hunterkll>	you're probably getting 4 out of the same box
<RayTracer>	if you have good backup, you could probably also use the green :) it took 5y of 24x7 before the first error showed up with mine

<pagios>	hi all, i am using autoconf to start xcalc directly wen openbox starts, trying to use wmctrl in the autoconf to size and put that xcalc in a specific area, it does not work it is always centered any idea?
<DLange>	pagios: may be a timing issue, try to insert a sleep 5    before setting window options with wmctrl
*	grepper wonders how autoconf can be used to start a program
<pagios>	DLange: works now
<DLange>	grepper: he doesn't really mean GNU autotools :) http://openbox.org/wiki/Help:Autostart
<pagios>	DLange: any idea how to disable that close hide move button?
<pagios>	i dont want users to be able to close the opened windows
<grepper>	ah. kudos for the psychic work :)
<DLange>	pagios: look at https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=31289 and adopt accordingly
<pagios>	DLange: you can remove the close minimize maximize buttons this way?
<DLange>	pagios: you can remove the whole window decoration that way
<pagios>	DLange: what is meant by window decor
<DLange>	pagios: the stuff where is says the window title, close/maximize/minimize buttons, resize handles
<pagios>	amazing
<pagios>	DLange: and can i disable keystrokes too? like disallow users to do control alt backstapce to exit the openbox
<DLange>	pagios: I guess so. Google is your friend :)
<pagios>	DLange: i am trying to lock users to use certain applications on boot startup and be locked there
<RayTracer>	isn't it sad that a free os is now used to lock in users?
<linuxthefish>	i have a linux PC as a wireless access point with DHCP and NAT, and the different SSID's come up as wlan1_1, wlan1_2 etc
<linuxthefish>	is there any way to join these networks together?
<linuxthefish>	else i have to setup different IP ranges, different DHCP servers and different NAT for each interface
<MrElendig>	as in bonding?
<MrElendig>	or bridge?
<MrElendig>	actually what is the *real* problem?
<MrElendig>	do you have a card that does both 2.4 and 5ghz?
<MrElendig>	and have seperate ssid for those two?
<linuxthefish>	no, just 2.4Ghz with different SSID's on
<MrElendig>	just use one ssid then?
<linuxthefish>	i can connect find, it's just it's seen as a different network to the first ssid in linux
<linuxthefish>	they have different encryption :/
<MrElendig>	the only reason to have multiple ssid is to run seperate virtual networks
<MrElendig>	you should not use anything but wpa2
<linuxthefish>	what's the easiest way to join wlan1 and wlan1_1 in ifconfig together?
<MrElendig>	don't use ifconfig
<MrElendig>	post ip l output

<pagios>	i want to create some GUI buttons to run in my openbox, what is a good/easy programming language/ library to use?
<thegladiator>	for what purpose?
<MrElendig>	python + qt5
<MrElendig>	also tacos and elephants
<MrElendig>	bha wrong channel
<pagios>	thegladiator: mainly i want buttons that have mouse and keystroke event listeners that can then fire commands in the background
<pagios>	MrElendig: ^
<pagios>	i know ruby
<thegladiator>	dmenu etc won't work for you?
<pagios>	whats dmenu
<MrElendig>	uhm
<MrElendig>	just use keybindings in openbox?
<thegladiator>	dmenu is used to run programs
<pagios>	i want buttons to be clicked
<MrElendig>	"that have mouse and keystroke event listeners"
<MrElendig>	makes no sense
<pagios>	mouse listenners on what objects?
<MrElendig>	if you want something to happen when you press a keybinding, just bind it in your wm
<MrElendig>	doing global keybindings outside of your wm is a horrible mess due to how xorg works
<pagios>	MrElendig: i want to allow users to use keybindingd as well as a menu with buttons where mouse clicks are pressed
<MrElendig>	pagios: use the wm for the keybinding
<MrElendig>	have the fancy buttons seperately
<MrElendig>	doing global keybindings outside of your wm is a mess
<pagios>	the fancy buttons in which language
<MrElendig>	imo anyway
<pagios>	ok for the keybinding
<MrElendig>	whatever you like
<pagios>	i am asking about the mouse thingies
<MrElendig>	if you know ruby then just use ruby
<MrElendig>	it has both gtk and qt bindings

<KingPrawn22>	Hi guys. On Ubuntu Gnome 15.04 and having trouble removing the Gnome 'system monitor'. Have uninstalled/purged, but there is still a gap between Caffine and the weather extension where system monitor still exists. Nothing shows up, but it is taking up this space
<deniska>	gnome panel or gnome shell?
<MrElendig>	KingPrawn22: run it from a terminal, look for errors
<deniska>	In gnome panel you could use win+alt+middle button click to move elements around
<deniska>	probabaly the same works in gnome shell though I doubt it
<KingPrawn22>	MrElendig, how can I do that?
<MrElendig>	open a terminal, type in the command, press enter
<JodaZ>	do i need to set the count parameter for sendfile? can i use -1 to send all?
<KingPrawn22>	there were no errors in launching it from terminal after reinstalling it
<MrElendig>	no output at all?
<KingPrawn22>	opens system monitor with no output at all
<MrElendig>	test as a new user
<pagios>	MrElendig: is openbox a decent wm? anything better to consider?
<MrElendig>	use whatever you like
<MrElendig>	personally I prefer either a full DE or a tiler
<pagios>	what is a tiler?
<MrElendig>	a tiling window manager
<madprops>	openbox is a decent wm
<madprops>	the best one imo
<MrElendig>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager
<pagios>	so openbox is a tiler
<deniska>	no, it is a floater =)
<KingPrawn22>	MrElendig, doesn't appear with new user
<pagios>	whats a decent tiler to consider
<MrElendig>	xmonad
<pagios>	so mainly the difference between xmonad and openbox is that openbox elements float and can overlap whereas xmonad allows windows to be tiled and not overlap
<x3>	pagios: I highly recommend i3: http://i3wm.org/
<pagios>	i mainly want to create a kind of a desktop environment for users to use applications
<pagios>	so i am firing multiple commands and using wmctl to group them and align them on screen
<pagios>	what do you guys suggest
<MrElendig>	xmonad
<x3>	MrElendig: have you used i3?
<MrElendig>	http://xmonad.org/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Actions-TopicSpace.html
<MrElendig>	sounds like what you want
<pagios>	i3 vs xomnad

<jamesbdev>	hi i'm a bit of a noob, why does this command not work 'echo www.google.com www.linux.com | xargs -I {} curl {}' but this one does 'echo www.google.com www.linux.com | xargs curl' ?
<pagios>	MrElendig: x3 so in a tiling wm i can just fire my program and no need to give it coordiantes right? it will adjust to the grid according to the display screen resolution?
<pagios>	lik i can say middle top , bottom middle etc?
<MrElendig>	pagios: with a dynamic tiler, yes
<pagios>	coz in openbox i am giving coordinates x,y,a,b
<stevecam>	would there be an equivalent of a push version of SSH? i want to be able to send commands from my phone without opening a connection every single time
<x3>	pagios: you have also enough configuration options with i3. E.g. a window can automatically open in a specific workspace.
<MrElendig>	uhm ssh can do that
<MrElendig>	you don't have to open a full shell session
<MrElendig>	man ssh
<MrElendig>	you can tell it to just run some command
<pagios>	i3 is a dynamic tiler?
<MrElendig>	yes
<pagios>	i will give it a shot
<MrElendig>	there are very few pure manual tilers around
<x3>	pagios: watch the can screencasts
<pagios>	thank you all
<pagios>	seems xonomad is good but i3 is more popular
<jamesbdev>	hi i'm a bit of a noob, why does this command not work 'echo www.google.com www.linux.com | xargs -I {} curl {}' but this one does 'echo www.google.com www.linux.com | xargs curl' ?

<jamesbdev>	MrElendig, sorry Im just playing around trying to understand xargs
<phre4k>	I currently just skip in the video, MrElendig
<MrElendig>	jamesbdev: first lesson: in most cases where you think you need xargs, or xargs is the correct solution; it isn't
<jamesbdev>	i want it to execute the xargs command one time for each in the space separated list
<jamesbdev>	then xargs sucks and cant do it
<MrElendig>	the main use of xargs it to build arugument lists like  somecommand  arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4
<MrElendig>	just write a for loop if you want command arg1; command arg2; command arg3...
<jamesbdev>	ok ill look into bash loops thx bby
<thegladiator>	pagios: sorry was away, i use i3. try to avoid creating buttons as much as possible - coz you might be looking for something like XFCE then
<thegladiator>	so if you think openbox doesn't have buttons check lxde or xfce. if you like tiling check i3 or awesome

<BluesKaj>	phre4k, why are you playing an avi file in FF anyway?
<phre4k>	MP4 and AC3 Stereo
<phre4k>	BluesKaj: a presentation about chemistry in Breaking Bad
<phre4k>	I want to show video clips I extracted as AVI containing MP4 / AC3
<BluesKaj>	uhm, those files should be played in a proper video player not a browser
<MrElendig>	mp4 is not an encoding
<phre4k>	this is not an option, you know ;)
<phre4k>	since I want the videos embedded in the browser
<BluesKaj>	phre4k, then convert them to flv/flash files
<MrElendig>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4_Part_14
<MrElendig>	mp4 is a container
<phre4k>	H.264 -.-
<phre4k>	no need for nitpicking
<MrElendig>	it is not nitpicking
<MrElendig>	because it is the actual encoding that matters
<JodaZ>	phre4k, if you meant mpeg4 for example, browsers wouldn't support that
<MrElendig>	JodaZ: wrong
<MrElendig>	JodaZ: many mpeg4 encodings are supported in browsers
<MrElendig>	JodaZ: h264, 265, quicktime, and more
<MrElendig>	JodaZ: if they didn't, youtube html5 would not work
<BluesKaj>	MrElendig, mistaken is a kinder word :-)
<phre4k>	I converted it to M4V with handbrake and the browser can view it, however the vid is choppy at begin and end
<MrElendig>	techically mpeg4 is not a single encoding
<MrElendig>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4
<JodaZ>	MrElendig, h264 is MPEG-4/AVC, h265 doesn't contain MPEG4 in the name afaik, quicktime is a plugin
<MrElendig>	qt is both a container and encoding and a format
<MrElendig>	short story: it is a fucking mess
<phre4k>	ha! got it! I have to convert it directly in Avidemux :)
<JodaZ>	everyone understands mpeg4 as "MPEG-4 Part 2" when talking about codecs
<MrElendig>	and ofcourse it is a player too
<MrElendig>	JodaZ: only in your limited world
<MrElendig>	you have clearly never worked in telecom or broadcasting
<MrElendig>	nor with fansubs :p
<phre4k>	jesus, video cutting and encoding consumes a lot of time
<phre4k>	if you want to know, I encoded it within Avidemux with MPEG-4 AVC and MP3 and output format MP4, then Firefox embeds it without effort
<phre4k>	<video src="file.mp4"> works flawlessly
<MrElendig>	that is why people edit using dv or similar formats

<arussel>	if I have a date: '17 mai 2015', how can I have a linux timestamp for noon in California ?
<thegladiator>	oh okay pagios
<thegladiator>	is it for helping window management or some other app?
<pagios>	thegameg: it is mainly to display applications in certain window coordinates
<thegladiator>	alright
<pagios>	so using i3 i think i can do a mouse listener and send a swap command to i3 to make exec new application in a specific area
<pagios>	or hide/move/applications right?
<thegladiator>	hide is not there in i3 - they use something that they called scratchpad - just move it from display
*	Omni is now known as Guest88419
<x3>	pagios: you can configure it to your full satisfaction. If you cannot, there are countless small extensions available
<thegladiator>	and i3 is good at tiling, if you try floating then it won't look good like openbox or fluxbox
<thegladiator>	in tile you could resize stuff though (coordinates etc)

<thegladiator>	yes I have keybindings, but it has to scriptable as well
<pagios>	great
<thegladiator>	i haven't scripted i3 - never had need but need to check it out ... but depending on the usage and patterns
<pagios>	thegameg: how easy is it to hide a current window and show something instead, while keeping the hidden program running
<x3>	pagios: suggest you read the docs, they are quite good. There is also the official #i3 channel on irc.twice-irc.de
<pagios>	tx
<thegladiator>	x3 isn't the i3 channel at freenode the official one?

<Filystyn>	Unix network programming   - some good book about it?
<compdoc>	the book of google
<Filystyn>	that's one anyone else ?
<A124>	Hello. Any ideas how can I format code, including newlines? Basicaly have bunch of files with  different code and formatting. Some are same. Want to remove duplicates then diff them.
<A124>	So minify, uniq, format, diff, would be best. its C code.
<A124>	Filystyn Depends on language, if Unix really or *nix or Linux, etc. Your question is too wide.
<gothos>	uncrustify to format code?
<Filystyn>	i guess ill just google and check every book i find starting from thishttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX_Network_Programming
<phogg>	A124: fmt, mostly
<Silenced_v2>	Guys what is kernel patching ? And how it is done ?
<phogg>	A124: for C, use indent
<Silenced_v2>	Any suggested links ?
<phogg>	Silenced_v2: get source, change source. That's a patch
<phogg>	Silenced_v2: If I take the changed sources and distribute them as a diff, that's also called a patch
<Silenced_v2>	phogg how to distribute the specific patch alone ?
<Silenced_v2>	Suppose i make a change in makefile
<phogg>	Silenced_v2: patch(1) is also a command line utility to take one or more diffs and change the original source with them, which is called patching
<phogg>	Silenced_v2: keep a copy of the unmodified code in dir a/, modify the code in dir b/
<phogg>	Silenced_v2: after modification cd .. and run diff -ur a/ b/ > out.diff
<phogg>	Silenced_v2: out.diff is a file which can be used by patch(1) to turn a into b
<A124>	phogg Thank you. I guess swallow optional lines etc is what I need. Hopefully I find the needed code.
<thegladiator>	Beej's networking guide was popular I guess
<Silenced_v2>	phogg: Thanks man !
<Silenced_v2>	Now i get that clearly
<C0MPAQ>	are there any code linearization plugins?
<Silenced_v2>	phogg: Even a single line of code will be shown as difference right ?
<C0MPAQ>	i.e. functions, classes and other procedural containers are resolved if they appear only X times
<C0MPAQ>	same for CSS files etc. in HTML
<C0MPAQ>	people fragment code so much nowadays, it is a major slowdown to read it
<C0MPAQ>	just stare at it, bam, you know what it does
<C0MPAQ>	that used to work very well
<C0MPAQ>	now it is all empty gunpowder
<phogg>	Silenced_v2: no, only the different parts and some context
<Silenced_v2>	phogg: ok

<visceral>	Oookay. Who can help me with video playback issues on Ubuntu? 15.04 amd64, Intel Corporation Mobile GM965/GL960 Integrated Graphics Controller. Firefox is dropping frames, and Google Chrome (64-bit installed from google.com/chrome) is tearing the video.
<visceral>	This is HTML5 video, not Flash
<visceral>	e.g. playing random things on YouTube. Action sequences show it off nicely, e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZxNbAwY_rk
<MrElendig>	what hardware is this?
<MrElendig>	also only way to *really* fix tearing is freesync/gsync
<visceral>	MrElendig: I pasted the lspci line. It's GM965/GL960 on a ThinkPad R61
<sinni800>	anyone has a tip for a nice peer 2 peer local network chat?
<MrElendig>	visceral: that doesn't actually tell me what cpu you have
<visceral>	MrElendig: what about Firefox's dropped frames? It's not tearing there like it is in Chrome
<visceral>	MrElendig: oh, sorry... it's a C2D T7250
<MrElendig>	if it is a tomato then you might not be able to play back 1080p h264/265
<MrElendig>	without some drops
<MrElendig>	specially if you can't use gpu decoding
<scottj>	Is there a command to tell me the location of the icon that x/gtk apps are using for a specific app? There seem to be a lot of different ways to configure the icon of an app and I can't remember which method I used.
<MrElendig>	with that cpu you might actually get drops if you do software decoding
<visceral>	MrElendig: it's 360p resolution video on both browsers. Same hardware on Windows 8.1 does HD HTML5 video flawlessly
<visceral>	MrElendig: how do I check the decoding method?
<MrElendig>	visceral: intel actually supports hardware decoding of 264 on windows
<MrElendig>	on gnu/linux they don't really do it, sadly
<MrElendig>	should never drop with 360p though
<visceral>	i wonder why it is...
<visceral>	freesync/gsync appear to be NVIDIA/AMD solutions, yeah?
<visceral>	not for Intel
<visceral>	could it be that intel linux drivers for my hardware just aren't as good as their windows counterparts?
<visceral>	i.e. "nothing i can do"?
<lonston2>	Intel 7500 Chipset PCIe Root Port  what is this means ?
<SirLagz>	heh. root. Giggity
*	SirLagz goes back to the kids corner
<MrElendig>	visceral: freesync aka adaptivesync is a part of the displayport standard
<MrElendig>	visceral: anyone can implement it, currently only amd does though
<visceral>	MrElendig: that wouldn't help me given i'm using LVDS (laptop display) right?
<visceral>	oh ok
<visceral>	i might try a very minimal arch tomorrow. might be easier to troubleshoot... less moving parts than ubuntu.
<MrElendig>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeSync
<visceral>	yep, so given that LVDS != DisplayPort, it won't help me
<visceral>	i do like these ubuntu fonts though :\ -- i saw a blog post detailing how to tweak xorg on fedora to get ubuntu fonts without infinality, i might try it on arch
<visceral>	assuming i fix video in arch of course
<visceral>	or i could just reboot into windows every time i want to watch video...
<MrElendig>	could try mpv
<MrElendig>	or vlc
<visceral>	MrElendig: for html5 video?
*	metastableB is now known as metastableb
<MrElendig>	mpv "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcLNteez3c4" works just fine
<MrElendig>	same with vlc
<visceral>	ugh
<MrElendig>	are you using gstreamer 0.10 or 1.x with firefox btw?
<visceral>	wuat if the site insists on flash or doesn't work for a given link? sounds error prone and cumbersome, although i suppose it's good if i'm desperate (which i'm not that desperate yet)
<visceral>	let me check
*	GPenguin_ is now known as GPenguin
<MrElendig>	flash is just broken
<MrElendig>	the least crappy flash implementation is the flash taht is bundled with chrome
<MrElendig>	(you can use it in chromium and firefox too=
<MrElendig>	)
<Xanather>	flash is dying
<Xanather>	long live flash!
<visceral>	i have a feeling that if i fix html5 video, my flash video situation will also improve
<visceral>	i hate flash as much as the next guy but i'm not going to change my workflow just because linux can't handle it
<visceral>	how do i check the gstreamer bit? ldd didn't work
<MrElendig>	tell your package manager to list the deps of firefox
<visceral>	i did. i failed.
<visceral>	one sec, let me try something else
<visceral>	yeah i'm not seeing gstreamer as a dep (apt-cache show|showpkg)
<visceral>	unless i'm blind/tired/crazy
<MrElendig>	stupid ubuntu
<visceral>	there's 1.4.5 and 0.10
<MrElendig>	which version of firefox?
<visceral>	dpkg -l |grep gstream
<visceral>	38
<visceral>	and latest chrome
<visceral>	42.0.2311.152
<visceral>	i could just run linux in a vm on windows and stop being such a purist
<visceral>	that way i can do webdev and have fast video without effort
<visceral>	but it feels dirty ;)
<MrElendig>	or get some modern hardware :p
<visceral>	i'm way to cheap for that
<visceral>	soon... once i get more money
<visceral>	it's not the hardware though it's the os
<MrElendig>	if 360p is dropping frames then something is seriously wrong in your software stack though
<visceral>	yep
<MrElendig>	well hardware too
<visceral>	like i said, windows handles HD fine
<MrElendig>	your cpu is too slow to software render 1080p
<visceral>	no like 720p on youtube and stuff
<MrElendig>	and your gpu can't do 10bit h264 nor h265
<MrElendig>	(doesn't support it in the decoding engine)
<visceral>	but forget HD, even low quality video fails
<visceral>	HD is irrelevant to this fix
<MrElendig>	anyway, test with vlc/mpv/mplayer
<MrElendig>	try different -vo's too
<visceral>	so much effort to click around different pages
<visceral>	manually pasting a link to a commandline :(
<MrElendig>	including vaapi
<visceral>	i'll try the arch way first
<visceral>	they have better doco/support
<visceral>	if i can't fix it there, then i'll consider commandline desperation
<MrElendig>	https://01.org/linuxgraphics/community/vaapi
<visceral>	MrElendig: i think my hardware is to old for vaapi
<MrElendig>	hmm, your ancient cpu might not be supported by the free vaapi driver
<visceral>	yep
<MrElendig>	got to love intel for their "support" of open source
<MrElendig>	like with boot guard...
<visceral>	so the problem is that the linux drivers for my hardware aren't up to snuff, right
<visceral>	what happened with boot guard
<MrElendig>	http://patrick.georgi-clan.de/2015/02/17/intel-boot-guard/
*	Guest72490 is now known as Eclipse
<visceral>	that's not linux-specific though is it?
<MrElendig>	visceral: ofcourse they sign for microsoft
<visceral>	MrElendig: also, so in your mental flow chart of my problem, i'm out of options besides mpv/vlc right?
*	normalra1 is now known as normalra
<MrElendig>	visceral: try mpv/vlc to *test*
<visceral>	(and buying new hardware of course)
<visceral>	okay, doing now
<MrElendig>	since they use different libs than firefox/chromium for playback
<MrElendig>	and you don't have the whole browser overhead
<visceral>	MrElendig: no perceptible tearing in mpv. Let me test for dropped frames
<MrElendig>	mpv can tell you if it drops, but enabeling the overlay may actually cause drops itself :p
<visceral>	MrElendig: how? By just carefully looking I see that mpv has less frame drop than Firefox, but it's still perceptible
<visceral>	oh i see, the status line
<visceral>	it's dropping
<HotCoder>	hello
<A124>	Anyone has any idea how to debug kernel module? Compiled without error, loaded without error, then activation fails, dmesg says only failed.
<HotCoder>	im gonna use linux on my rasp pi
<HotCoder>	and code some node.js and ruby on rails on there
<HotCoder>	is that ok t odo so?
<visceral>	MrElendig: it's like 11.9% dropped frames for a short sample video
<A124>	HotCoder Why would it not be ok.
<A124>	One thing to consider.. Flash and writes.
<A124>	Aka SDCard.
<HotCoder>	A124, well im new to rasp pis
<MrElendig>	cpu running at full speed?
<HotCoder>	just not sure on the limitations of it
<A124>	Also I had problems with Raspbian on RPI1.. idk if that was problem of anything.
<jd1>	A124: add debug prints. recompile ko. rmmod + insmod
<A124>	HotCoder Memory, and stuff.
<HotCoder>	A124, hm?
<HotCoder>	i dont have the pi yet
<HotCoder>	im getting it shipped
<A124>	jd1 I only do modprobe instead rmmod insmod .. is that ok, or it does not load the new module?
<visceral>	MrElendig: it's a 2GHz processor running at 800MHz
<jd1>	just depends where the ko gets installed
<MrElendig>	at 800MHz it is no wonder that it is dropping frames
<MrElendig>	isn't it clocking up at all?
<jd1>	I do insmod because I break my system and need my vanilla ko
<visceral>	MrElendig: let me play a video and see
<MrElendig>	powertop is usefull
<visceral>	MrElendig: oh yeah, sorry it does clock up
<jd1>	you can oprofile the kmod. might give an indication if it hit a livelock or something else
<A124>	jd1 Well, I copy it to the lib/include and do depmod. But it seems it does not unload even.. "Module in use" .. by rmmod.
<A124>	No idea how to fix that instead of reboot.
<jd1>	yeah
<visceral>	MrElendig: i was just repeatedly grepping /proc/cpuinfo, but yeah i see that powertop has differnt stages of turbo on the cpu cores
<prinsen>	If i add a bridge to a interface, other traffic stops. I have a linux box as a router with 2 interfaces. If i add a bridge to the internal interface, clients can't reach the web (or the router)
<A124>	jd1 So.. the module I have compiled might have not even loaded. ..  which.. could be the culprit or not. Thank you. got few more things to look at
<jd1>	yeah sorry cant help. sounds like its missing some unwind in its fialing path too
<MrElendig>	prinsen: create the bridge, add the interfaces then dhcpcd thebridge
<MrElendig>	or set the static ip
<jd1>	*failing
<MrElendig>	ip/route
<visceral>	MrElendig: i may resume this tomorrow given that it's 12:26am and I have work tomorrow :) thank you very much for your help
*	visceral buys MrElendig a beverage
<prinsen>	MrElendig: Why is that need? Won't traffic get routed correctly (to the external interface) even if I add it to a bridge?
<A124>	HotCoder You got 1GB memory, CPU is also limit, and SDcard is slow about read and writes, plus writes on SD often kill it and make the app slow.
<phre4k>	sooo, I'm done with my reveal.js presentation including video. Enter "Meth Busters"! :D http://phre4k.at/pub/hs/methbusters
<HotCoder>	A124, ah okay
<HotCoder>	well i want to use the gadget lol
*	A124 wrote that kernel module, but lost it, now trying to recover and find the right version to continue coding and update to 4.x. If reboot is needed each try and will solve it, then let it be. Used some analysis to narrow down possible sources to few files.
<A124>	HotCoder ODROID-C1
<prinsen>	MrElendig: Is all traffic from the internal interface just sent to the bridge?
<A124>	eMMC is a lto faster.
<HotCoder>	A124, wat

<amigoo89>	@Psi-Jack: Which plugins do I need to install? I did it exactly like a tutorial. @ MrElendig, I don't know what plaintext is
<socomm>	MrElendig: That doesn't scale well.
<Psi-Jack>	amigoo89: Distro?
<socomm>	amigoo89: I think he means system users, not plaintext users.
<socomm>	Or he might. I don't know.
<MrElendig>	socomm: if this is just for private email for him and his mom then that doesn't really matter does it?
<ilhami>	hey
<Psi-Jack>	Yeah... Don't really need mysql.
<ilhami>	is it fine to use hibernation as an alternative for shutting down the laptop?
<MrElendig>	sqlite, plaintext or pam
<socomm>	MrElendig: What about him and his wife. They'll have 5 kids and then what?
<MrElendig>	socomm: still trivial to manage
<A124>	Psi-Jack Not sure if ps does not show what I want, or he disconneceted. But I think someone else with root permissions might spy on my session.
<socomm>	Aren't there distros for this type of stuff.
<MrElendig>	sqlite is perfectly fine even for a few thousand users
<rumpel>	ilhami, sure. it's a bit more complicated and might cause issues, especially on laptops. Try it.
<MrElendig>	more than fast enough
<Psi-Jack>	I mean, my mail server incorporates a full postgresql server, ldap server, postfix, dovecot, clamav, dspam, and horde infrastructure, accross 3 servers. :)
<amigoo89>	Okay I've honestly no Idea, how I can set it up with something else than MySQL
<Psi-Jack>	A124: Why would you say/think that?
<ilhami>	rumpel, I hate to power off my laptop. :P
<socomm>	Zimbra. iRedmail. Sogo.
<ilhami>	hibernation and everything is ready. :P
<Psi-Jack>	Ewww, iRedCrap
<A124>	Psi-Jack When I asked if he wants to know how to do something, he just said, write in screen I can see.
<rumpel>	ilhami, then use that. But be aware of the risks/disadvantages/...
<socomm>	A124: Does anyone else have root access to your machine?
<ilhami>	what are the risks and disadvantages?
<socomm>	A124: is this a work machine?
<A124>	socomm Yes. Thats the point. Yes its "work" machine.
<socomm>	A124: Well if its 'work' you should never have any sense of privacy.
<Psi-Jack>	A124: Tell your co-worker doing what he's doing is illegal, and to stop.
<rumpel>	ilhami, well... it might not work at all or you could create inconsistencies when you access the OS another way
<socomm>	Psi-Jack: How is it illegal?
<Psi-Jack>	socomm: Privacy invasion.
<rumpel>	ilhami, just try it.
<A124>	I do not mind the sharing stuff, but mind of someone is going invisible to my house looking at me how I take a shit.
<socomm>	Psi-Jack: At work? C'mon.....
<ilhami>	rumpel, hmm.. I mean I did try it and it worked fine.
<A124>	Psi-Jack Hmm.. good catch. Thanks.
<Psi-Jack>	A124: Mind your language, please.
<socomm>	A124: Its not your house. Everything you do at work, you are being paid for.
<ilhami>	I was just asking if I could keep doing it but I will try it.
<Psi-Jack>	socomm: YEs, at work.
<socomm>	A124: Remember that. Stop goofing off.
<Psi-Jack>	socomm: If someone, even at work, was doing that to me without telling me, I would be bringing that up to HR and legal recourse.
<socomm>	Psi-Jack: Good thing I have a login banner that states everything you do on the system is being monitored.
<Psi-Jack>	Course, there's also just disabling screen from having an open share so it has to be specifically enabled, like DEFAULT screen setup is.
<A124>	socomm: a) my userspace is my house/room, if you take computer as house. I would expect a hotel room level of privacy. Also there is no legal ground to watch me invisibly in my room. Go there and manipulate stuff, for the sake of backups, anything, of course.
<socomm>	A124: A.) HA!
<socomm>	A124: Can someone come to your cubicle and watch you work? Or did they give you a corner office with lock and key?
<A124>	Psi-Jack How do I achieve that? .. I in past had nifty mutliuser setup that would show any "other" users on any of the screens on statusline. Got lost by idiot that did format whole machine because he could not get in touch few days, thanks to broken phone.
<A124>	socomm We do not use cubicles here.
<socomm>	A124: What do we use?
<Psi-Jack>	A124: Well you could also just use tmux, too. :D
<A124>	I like my screen. xD I guess he could spy on tmux, as that is his default so he is proficient in that.
<Psi-Jack>	A124: I don't use screen anymore.
<Psi-Jack>	A124: Learn your tools and how to configure them properly and securely, too.
<socomm>	A124: If the person has root privileges he can still see your home directory and process list.
<A124>	I like screen, I do not like people abusing me in all areas and agles of my life.
<A124>	I dont mind home dir or process list. As I said. Same as maid in hotel.
*	socomm feels bad for the victims
<A124>	Google seems to filter stuff differently some stuff is hard to find. Tried to find how to display users even that file.
<socomm>	A124: Just out of curiousity what does the person who's 'spying' on you do.
<A124>	What I learned, but unable to execute.. thanks to lack of things, is have at least two backups. Idealy 3N+1 .. which would be four.
<socomm>	What is their role in the company/department?
<A124>	socomm Hardware (electronics) devel.
<socomm>	A124: Why would s/he have root privileges?
<socomm>	You guys didn't hire a System person?
<socomm>	Or is this like his/her dev environment you're working on?
<A124>	Nope. External guy did the setup, gave privileges. So he "keeps" it, and I got it for when I need to modify system stuff or install things.
<Psi-Jack>	A124: And what is your role?
<socomm>	Psi-Jack: Developer I'd presume.
<A124>	Yeah.
<socomm>	Hehe, I'm good at profiling personality types. :^)
<Psi-Jack>	Well, as long as he has root, there's not much you can do, besides tell him to stop and go to HR.
<Psi-Jack>	And/or your immediate boss. :)
<socomm>	I'd go to the boss first, but thats just me.
<A124>	Well, yeah. Personal thing. But wondered if anyone knew about.. how to display users attached to screen. Google no luck so far.
<Psi-Jack>	Yeah, same.
<socomm>	By the way if he has root he can always modify your screen config back to whatever he likes.
<socomm>	Just a thought.
<socomm>	Among other things.
<dannylee>	when you put FREE BSD  on your machine..its hard too replace it with linux..some times it takes several installation with linux too get your machine working...i installed linux over 200 times on all type of computers...
<Psi-Jack>	A124: Default in screen: C-A *
<Psi-Jack>	To see a list of connected users to  your screen session.
<socomm>	DNF is the new yum?
<ninebits>	YAY!
<Psi-Jack>	socomm: Yes
<socomm>	systemd now dnf
<Psi-Jack>	socomm: dnf is actually pretty dang awesome.
<A124>	Psi-Jack Yeah that displays something. Not sure if that is it, but still helps, thanks. Need to change bindings.
<Psi-Jack>	yum was fast, dnf is faster.
<socomm>	My skill set is slowly being made irrelevant by the future.
<Psi-Jack>	socomm: Not really, dnf is practically fully compatible with yum.
<A124>	I loved yum.
<socomm>	Is it drop in replacement for yum?
<A124>	Since yum was rewritten it was freaking awesome.
<socomm>	DNF actually soudns kinda cool though.
<Psi-Jack>	A124: Most likely your co-worker is su'ing to root, then su'ing to your user to attach to your screen session.
<Psi-Jack>	socomm: Yes
<socomm>	A124: translation - you're fscked
<Psi-Jack>	I played with it Friday in a VM on Fedora 22 beta 3. :)
<socomm>	Psi-Jack: Nice. I'm gonna need to check it out.
<dob1>	hi, can i setup rsync to exclude *cache* directories whatever they are in the path?
<socomm>	dob1: yes.
<Psi-Jack>	Yeah, I wanted to toss Fedora 22 beta 3 on my laptop, but it won't start up the installer. :/
<socomm>	dob1: /j #rsync
<Psi-Jack>	Likely video card compatability issues I need to report. :/
<socomm>	dob1: Also read the manual.
<dob1>	socomm, i mean image_cache, whatever_cache,  i know about exclude
<Stiky>	lol... of course the first thing I read is a RTM
<socomm>	dob1: Yes. Read hte manual, it outlines just how to do what you mentioned.
<socomm>	dob1: http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/01/rsync-exclude-files-and-folders/
<Psi-Jack>	socomm: I hate that URL.
<Psi-Jack>	Mistakes directories with these things called "folders" heh
<socomm>	Psi-Jack: Don't blame you, but I'm not going deeper than the first result for this question.
*	socomm heads off the the hardware store
<A124>	Psi-Jack Hmm.. Seems it shows the hardline & when sharing.. I had better screenrc.. probably lost forever.. could try Google more or make some of my own to make it green square and some other stuff. Thank you.
<dob1>	socomm, thanks
<amigoo89>	guys, I deleted the .log file in /var/logs in order to reset it, because there were too many entries there, and now I don't get new log entries
<Psi-Jack>	Heh
<goawayrain2>	hello, is anybody experienced with Tor?
<Psi-Jack>	goawayrain2: Do you have a real question, specifically one pertaining to Linux?
<goawayrain2>	maybe Psi-Jack but I asked first
<Psi-Jack>	Polling is bad, don't do it.
<goawayrain2>	clear
<goawayrain2>	!clear
<goawayrain2>	ah that's better :)
*	Psi-Jack widens an eye.
<rascul>	i don't get it
<Psi-Jack>	Nor I. :p
<A124>	Can I get my terminal application react to mouseclick somehow?
<goawayrain2>	hmmm, I can't get hold of the tor browser and no i'm not looking to do anything illegal ha
<Psi-Jack>	A124: Yes, if the application supports it.
<Psi-Jack>	By saying that just like that, I don't believe you! :p
<A124>	Well the application does not exist.. or is half done.. my own app. Making helpers on pc for non pc devel.
<A124>	Installing gdm, else have no idea wheer to look at.
<Psi-Jack>	A124: Well, for example, vim supports gpm and X mouse support. You just have to enable it. :)
<goawayrain2>	A124: who you talking to :)
<Psi-Jack>	But, that's because vim was programmed to support such things.
<A124>	Psi-Jack Yes, I am looking to make something that supports it. Looking at a way how to "receive" such messages from the app.
<Psi-Jack>	A124: And what language is this "app" written in?
<NeoGeo64>	Why do police always want you to get on the ground, and do it now?
<NeoGeo64>	why cant i do it in a few minutes?
<A124>	Psi-Jack I use diff languages but mostly C/C++, Ruby.
<Psi-Jack>	NeoGeo64: Why does some random stranger ask stupid questions in a ##linux question?
<Psi-Jack>	Err, channel? ;)
<truefacts>	 they should at least let you finish skinning the hooker
<NeoGeo64>	i juse linux mint 17.1
<NeoGeo64>	use*
<dob1>	i have this file "Cosa vuoi? (Utente).txt"   i am unable to delete it   rm Cosa\ vuoi\?\ \(Utente\).txt    -> rm: cannot remove 'Cosa vuoi? (Utente).txt': No such file or directory
<NeoGeo64>	I have a bad case of carpal tunnel righjt now
<NeoGeo64>	i can barely type
<A124>	Psi-Jack C/C++ seems to use a library and.. ruby a gem. Not sure how about support for SSH remote sessions, you got any ideas?
<tombee>	Is there a way to attach a tty when doing: `curl -s file:///path/to/script.sh | bash -si`
<Psi-Jack>	A124: Well, your best bet to incporporate such functionality is through ncurses libraries. But that's hell to add in ncurses support if it's already half-written stuff. :)
<barometz>	dob1: have you tried tab-completing the name?
<NeoGeo64>	its been messed up for a few days
<dob1>	barometz, yes
<NeoGeo64>	itll be a couple weeks before it will heal
<NeoGeo64>	it sucks i hate it
<Psi-Jack>	NeoGeo64: Sto get off IRC and go relax?
<NeoGeo64>	so hard to type or use coooamd line
<NeoGeo64>	command*
<NeoGeo64>	well dude ive been off irc for a few days now
<NeoGeo64>	i miss it and i miss typig
<NeoGeo64>	so im going to try and type and get my hand better
<NeoGeo64>	its real hard tho
<A124>	Voice recognition.
<Psi-Jack>	NeoGeo64: But you're rambling, and interupting actual people trying to get Linux help. :)
<NeoGeo64>	im, on a pc.. i have a mic/webcam.. what voice programs are there for linux mint?
<NeoGeo64>	sorry Psi-Jack
<A124>	Not sure.. there is something.
<A124>	I was trying to find something to have user commands. Found one usable for other stuff then user commands, so I forgot the names.
<goawayrain2>	NeoGeo64: tell the cops you want knee pads first
<cnap>	Hey people :)
<cnap>	Trying to learn some basic Return Oriented Programming
<cnap>	and I want to use the glibc-2.14
<cnap>	but its not in my system
<cnap>	I only need this to generate some gadgets with a tool
<cnap>	What would be the best solution ?
<Linnak>	hi. can you help me guys? I highlighted some packages in synaptic and one of the wants to remove an important packages from my system so it says fix broken packages. I know I have no broken packages so the problem must be that it wants to remove a part from the desktop environment. how can I see whic package wants to remove that?
<Linnak>	i know what it wants to remove
<Psi-Jack>	What're you trying to remove, what's it trying to remove, and what distro?
<Psi-Jack>	Synaptic, i'm guessing Ubuntu.
<Linnak>	elementary os and something want's to remove phanteon-photos
<delt>	Hello
<Psi-Jack>	Define "something"
<delt>	i have pulseaudio running as a jack client - how do i set permissions so i can run programs as another user with sound?
<delt>	either with pulseaudio or directly with jack
<Linnak>	I have a lot of packages selected i can't define which one is the problem that's my question. how to find this out?
<ayecee>	unselect pacakges until the problem goes away
<Psi-Jack>	Well for starters, don't use synaptic?
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<Psi-Jack>	Or that.
<goawayrain2>	Linnak: chuck your comp out of the window possibly?
<Psi-Jack>	goawayrain2: Do you have anything useful to contribute, or just wise-arse cracks?
<ayecee>	the pot has some nasty words for the kettle XD
<diegoviola>	delt: you need to export a variable IIRC
<diegoviola>	I did that before, I can't recall how
<diegoviola>	PULSE_SERVER
<diegoviola>	Google it
<delt>	diegoviola: thanks very much for the info. looking on google...
<Psi-Jack>	Bleh, I hate when I have a system with proper setup of permissions on home, .ssh and authorized_keys, and key authentication yet still fails.
<diegoviola>	delt: I see there's info here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PulseAudio/Configuration
<delt>	diegoviola: my other account is part of the 'audio' group, but i still get just silence :(
<diegoviola>	delt: the audio group is irrelevant
<diegoviola>	that's relevant for ALSA, pulse doesn't need it
<delt>	diegoviola: i checked for permissions in stuff in /dev/snd and /dev/shm, set everything to a+rwx....
<diegoviola>	I think you don't even need to set up that variable
<diegoviola>	delt: you don't need to mess with any of that for pulse, I'm not on the audio group yet I have sound
<Psi-Jack>	Hmm, in fact, it seems to only be my Manjaro systems not accepting my ssh keys. :/
<diegoviola>	delt: give me a sec, I'll create another user and I'll test this for you
<triceratux>	Linnak: the synaptic on elementaryos is horrid. the blogs agree the first thing you should do is install aptitude http://www.binarytides.com/better-elementary-os-luna/
<triceratux>	oops
<delt>	diegoviola: i'd prefer to use the main user's jack connection, but for the mean time i'd just like my piano program to work.... i really don't want to do the registration stuff for another user (pianoteq has only 3 "activation"/registration slots, and i don't want to waste my last one)
<toothe>	I (think) i installed a root CA certificate in my /etc/ssl store, but chrome still says a certificate is untrusted.
<toothe>	I installed it properly in WIndows and it worked, so I must be doing something wrong in Linux.
<toothe>	I'm running Ubuntu (with KDE if it matters)
<diegoviola>	delt: one second please
<hololeap>	delt: do you have jackd running as a system service?
<hololeap>	delt: or are you running it as your main user
<delt>	hololeap: i run jack from my X session's startup
<delt>	hololeap: so, as my main user
<delt>	hololeap: that might be the problem?
<delt>	hololeap: (btw this is ubuntu studio 14.04)
<delt>	diegoviola: np, and thansk for your help
<delt>	hololeap: so running it as a system service would be from a file in /etc/init.d?
<delt>	[pts/0][user@phobos]:/etc/init.d$ l | grep -i jack
<delt>	[pts/0][user@phobos]:/etc/init.d$
<delt>	:(
<stupid-1>	 8-)
<hololeap>	delt: not sure. i know that each user generally has its own pulseaudio instance. is there a pulseaudio instance starting for your second user?
<delt>	hololeap: nope. If there is, i'd presume it should be running as a jack client...?
<delt>	hololeap: (my main user's pulseaudio session is running as a client session of my main user's jack session)
<delt>	so everything audio is eventually routed through jack.
<hololeap>	delt: right, you would want it to connect to jackd. i'm not sure if jackd running as your main user would be a problem.
<delt>	hololeap: permissions on a pipe / socket somewhere, maybe...?
<delt>	(that would be my first guess)
<diegoviola>	delt: ok found it
<delt>	diegoviola: :D
<delt>	captain pikaro
<diegoviola>	delt: in order to play audio as another user, you need to enable a module, e.g. $ pactl load-module module-native-protocol-tcp auth-ip-acl=127.0.0.1
<diegoviola>	that's as your user where pulse is running
<diegoviola>	then as another user:
<diegoviola>	$ PULSE_SERVER=127.0.0.1 <command>
<diegoviola>	where command is whatever command that plays audio, mpv, mplayer, etc
<diegoviola>	that should "just work"
<diegoviola>	not sure if that's what you want
<delt>	so i can just export PULSE_SERVER=localhost in the second user's .bashrc ?
<hololeap>	delt: sounds like it. try it and see
<hololeap>	delt: you should probably use 127.0.0.1 so it doesn't try to connect using ipv6
<delt>	[pts/0][user@phobos]:~$ pactl load-module module-native-protocol-tcp auth-ip-acl=127.0.0.1
<delt>	(delay of about 5 seconds)
<delt>	Connection failure: Connection refused
<delt>	pa_context_connect() failed: Connection refused
<delt>	:(
<hololeap>	delt: are you running that as your main user or your secondary user?
<delt>	main
<diegoviola>	this is pretty well documented here: http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/Network/
<hololeap>	delt: if you just run `pactl info` as your main user, do you get the same error?
<hydraglyph>	On a desktop running Gentoo linux, I seem to have lost my login screens on my virtual terminals (ctrl-alt-F keys). What commands can I run to spawn a new login on the VTs?
<delt>	just "pactl load-module module-native-protocol-tcp" seems to hang indefinitely
<aliendude5300>	Let's say I have a fast M.2 SSD 1.5GB/s boot drive and a slower 550MB/s 1TB data drive. Is full disk encryption using LUKS a bad idea on my storage drive?
<ayecee>	aliendude5300: why would it be a bad idea?
<delt>	hololeap: yeah :(
<delt>	[pts/0][user@phobos]:~$ pactl info
<delt>	Connection failure: Connection refused
<delt>	pa_context_connect() failed: Connection refused
<aliendude5300>	ayecee: because it's an SSD and it might mess with TRIM
<delt>	weird
<delt>	lemme reboot the desktop machine (won't affect this irc session)
<diegoviola>	http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/Modules/#index22h3
<diegoviola>	see also this
<ayecee>	aliendude5300: luks doesn't allow trim. you can enable it, though.

<dooba2000>	I am trying to move a .pem file to ~/.ssh and it says permission denied and I can't figure out why.  sudo doesn't help
<dooba2000>	I'm rusty
<ayecee>	dooba2000: what's the command you're using?
<dooba2000>	ayecee: $ mv jinko.pem  ./.ssh/
<ayecee>	dooba2000: does it work with ~/.ssh instead of ./.ssh ?
<delt>	ok back
<dooba2000>	ayecee: No
<ayecee>	dooba2000: what's the output of "ls -ld ~/.ssh" ?
<delt>	hololeap, diegoviola: i just rebooted the desktop machine. now 'pactl info' works normally.
<dooba2000>	ayecee: drwx------ 2 jason jason 4.0K Mar 27  2014 /home/jason/.ssh
<ayecee>	dooba2000: what's the output of "ls -l jinko.pem" ?
<delt>	(ie. gives me all the info about the pulseaudio session)
<ayecee>	dooba2000: err, that doesn't matter so much, i guess.
<hololeap>	delt: then try $ pactl load-module module-native-protocol-tcp auth-ip-acl=127.0.0.1
<dooba2000>	ayecee: Ah, I have not secure it yet.  Is that why?
<dooba2000>	ayecee:  -rw-r--r-- 1 jason jason 1.7K May 17 18:28 jinko.pem
<ayecee>	no, that's not why.
<ayecee>	dooba2000: does it work if you cp instead of mv ?
<delt>	hololeap: just did. no errors :D ...how do i list loaded modules / check if it's loaded correctly?
<dooba2000>	ayecee:  cp: cannot create regular file `./.ssh/jinko.pem': Permission denied
<ayecee>	dooba2000: are you doing this as user jason?
<dooba2000>	ayecee: Yeah.  Tried sudo as well
<hydraglyph>	hololeap: Thank you!
<hololeap>	delt: netstat -tnap | grep pulse
<hydraglyph>	I thought it was someting getty, but couldn't seem to find the right words
<ayecee>	dooba2000: don't use sudo
<ayecee>	dooba2000: what's the output of "id" ?
<dooba2000>	ayecee: okay.  You now I set this server up ages ago.  I may have set the a bit to protect the directory.  Forgot how I did that though

<stealthii>	Hi there. I'm looking for an all-in-one mitm internet proxy that lets me monitor DNS, http, and https traffic. I've not been able to find prebuilt distributions with a web interface providing real-time statistics and logging of the above.
<stealthii>	My idea is having two physical interfaces, pop one into your internet, and another to your test device, and have a web, or desktop interface, show you all the dns & http requests that are sent over that bridged connection.
<hololeap>	delt: glad you made some progress
<delt>	hololeap: still lots of progress to make, but glad as well =)
<delt>	diegoviola, hololeap: so i should stick that 'pactl load-module' command in my main user's .xprofile, and the 'export PULSE_SERVER=127.0.0.1' in the guest/secondary user's .bashrc / .bash_profile and everything shoud be all set?
<delt>	just did that, testing....
<diegoviola>	pacmd load-module should also work
<diegoviola>	delt: Actually
<diegoviola>	delt: you can add the module to ~/.config/pulse/default.pa, i.e. load-module <module>
<diegoviola>	or globally at /etc/pulse/default.pa
<Zackio>	what versions of QEMU are affected by VENOM? can't find anything on the site or i'm not reading enough
<diegoviola>	delt: when pulseaudio starts it will read that config and will start the module for you
<delt>	diegoviola: thanks, testing it now....
<diegoviola>	s/start/load/
<diegoviola>	delt: you might only have to set that PULSE_SERVER variable in your .bash_profile though
<delt>	diegoviola: done. works like a charm
<diegoviola>	perfect
<delt>	thanks very much for your assistance!
<diegoviola>	you're welcome
<delt>	diegoviola: do you play the viola by any chance? =) just wondering
<diegoviola>	I don't :)
<diegoviola>	it happens to be my last name though
<Pessimist>	He only complains that Qt is written incorrectly in Linux source code
<diegoviola>	lol
<delt>	yeah, adding 'pactl load-module' to my .xprofile results in an error on login, so i'd better move it, like you said, to the pulseaudio config file
<delt>	so, the same line except no 'pactl' at the beginning,right?
<VladolfPutler>	If you insert a CardBus card into the slot, do you need to enter a command like cardctl or something?
<VladolfPutler>	Or does it init immediately like with the new ExpressCard?
<hololeap>	delt: right
<VladolfPutler>	By the way, I was using Trinity Rescue Kit, because my laptops that are in use, no longer have PCMCIA slot
<diegoviola>	delt: yes
<delt>	hololeap, diegoviola: done, testing again.... (rebooting the machine to make sure everything is in a default state)
<delt>	ok back from reboot, testing everything.....
<delt>	jack as normal user works....
<delt>	pulse as normal user works
<delt>	alsa as normal user DOES NOT....
<diegoviola>	your program is probably trying to access the sound device in /dev directly with alsa, add your user to the alsa group and it should work
<diegoviola>	$ gpasswd -a user audio
<diegoviola>	but why not just use pulse?
<diegoviola>	s/alsa/audio/
<delt>	pulse as secondary user WORKS (yay :D!)
<delt>	there's no group 'alsa' in my /etc/group
<diegoviola>	delt: I mean audio group, sorry
<delt>	yeah, it's already in that group
<delt>	in that group there's also users pulse, timidity, and mythtv
<diegoviola>	delt: then I'm not sure, what problem do you get when you try to use ALSA directly?
<FreezingCold>	How can I get my system to ignore the SD card lock?
<delt>	diegoviola: silence
<ayecee>	FreezingCold: i'd think that'd happen at the hardware level
<FreezingCold>	FSCK FSCK FSCK. I can't get the damn thing in without the lock flipping
<diegoviola>	delt: what distro are you on?
<delt>	diegoviola: ubuntu studio 14.04
<delt>	diegoviola: looking at mplayer's output for clues (with -ao alsa)
<diegoviola>	delt: you need to redirect alsa to go through pulseaudio
<delt>	yeah, next thing i was gonna try was futzing around with pavucontrol..... 2sec
<diegoviola>	delt: there is a package on archlinux that installs a /etc/asound.conf for you, which has this content: http://ix.io/48C
<delt>	diegoviola: just selected the right output device, now it works perfectly
<diegoviola>	delt: oh okay
<diegoviola>	delt: so you probably already have that package / file somewhere
<dbodax>	makeldconr
<delt>	diegoviola: btw video used for testing (most beautiful piano song ever) ---> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBKxe81-Z3s
<delt>	i LOVE playing that song
<delt>	but that's a bit off topic for now.....sorry
<diegoviola>	delt: so everything is working for you now?
<delt>	diegoviola: it would seem so... gonna reboot the desktop machine once more (again!) to make sure...
<delt>	(after this video :D )
<diegoviola>	delt: ok
<diegoviola>	if you ever need to reboot just pulseaudio, you can do that with pulseaudio -k
<delt>	ah, yeah.. knew that but didnt remember it somehow...
<delt>	ok, rebooting, brb
<diegoviola>	delt: ok
<gildedlink_>	it appears something may have gone horribly wrong with gpg lately, as a 4096 keypair has allegedly been factored
<gildedlink_>	so that makes for an exciting sunday
<delt>	diegoviola, hololeap: yes, everything seems to be working perfectly, thanks very much for your help!
<triceratux>	wut more chinese firedrills like the heartbleed daze ? http://trilema.com/2015/full-disclosure-4096-rsa-key-in-the-strongset-factored/
<coolbean50>	Hi guys. Anyone know how to recreate the /etc/grub.d/  config directory??? I just deleted it by accident. thanks
<delt>	diegoviola, hololeap: next step, reduce latency by connnecting directly to the main user's jack session.... but that's gonna be for another day :D
<Pessimist>	coolbean50, what distro do you use? Maybe reinstall some grub package using your package manager
<diegoviola>	delt: perfect, glad it's working for you
<thedudez0r>	anyone need a free server for some days? 0.6|1.7 gb ram, wheezy|centos 10GB disk (can add an extra 100GB)... pm me
*	kanzure_ is now known as kanzure
<delt>	got my laptop right here, gonna do the same configuration changes i did on the desktop machine...
<coolbean50>	Pessimist:  using arch. I tried grub-install  but it doesnt replace the configs in /etc/grub.d/
<bazhang>	thedudez0r, free?
<delt>	typing from the laptop as we ..uh, type, actually
<coolbean50>	suppose i have to reinstall grub then
<coolbean50>	???
<atomictissue>	I don't know what changed, but as of today the sound from my headphones isn't working.
<diegoviola>	delt: so the only thing you needed was to load the right module in the pulse config and use the PULSE_SERVER variable to connect to it as another user
<diegoviola>	delt: pretty simple, huh?
<thedudez0r>	bazhang: I'm "gifting" the server, so it is by all means free (at least for the next 30 days)
<atomictissue>	It was working yesterday
<Pessimist>	atomictissue, is the channel unmuted? check in alsamixer or somewhere else
<atomictissue>	Pessimist, yes it is
<Zackio>	hm, having a problem with xvfb, any user can connect to the display
<Zackio>	`xhost` says access control is enabled
<atomictissue>	I'm running Arch, if that matters.
<Zackio>	and -nolisten tcp # is specified
<delt>	ok, rebooting laptop to test....
<delt>	typing from the main (studio/desktop) machine now, laptop is still rebooting... (takes a while)
<atomictissue>	It's only the headphones. When I take them out of the jack, the speakers work fine.
<atomictissue>	The thing is, everything seems to be normal. It recognizes that the headphones are in, and it thinks it's playing sound through them, but it isn't.
<atomictissue>	I have tested that they work.
<diegoviola>	atomictissue: are you using pulseaudio?
<atomictissue>	yes
<diegoviola>	atomictissue: open pavucontrol and see if the stream is pointed to your device in the Playback section
<atomictissue>	I don't have pavucontrol
<diegoviola>	so install it?
<diegoviola>	you can do the same with pacmd/pactl too, but I don't recall how right now
*	ChanServ gives channel operator status to eir
*	eir removes ban on *!*@*652-1-465-178.w86-216.abo.wanadoo.fr$##fix_your_connection
*	eir removes channel operator status from eir
<delt>	alright, thanks very much for your help guys!
<atomictissue>	diegoviola, yes, it is pointed at my headphones
<kurahaupo_>	atomictissue: do you have alsamixer? It can run in non-GUI mode, and shows the separate output levels for speaker & earphones
<atomictissue>	Everything I have checked shows my headphones should be working
<atomictissue>	I have tried other headphones
<atomictissue>	I also booted windows and the sound came out there.
<[twisti]>	i get http://pastebin.com/xHm2cfRV, how can i proceed ? i just want to remove the offending packages
<diegoviola>	atomictissue: sounds like the device is muted?
<atomictissue>	it isn't
<diegoviola>	atomictissue: is this a usb headset?
<atomictissue>	no
<atomictissue>	just normal headphones, and it was working yesterday
<diegoviola>	atomictissue: alsamixer doesn't indicate the audio is muted?
<atomictissue>	no it doesn't
<atomictissue>	I have been messing around with UEFI and stuff trying to get Windows dual-booting, but I don't see how that would affect this.
<bazhang>	it wont
<diegoviola>	it won't
<atomictissue>	I thought not
<bazhang>	got pavucontrol and padevchooser isntalled?
<bazhang>	what distro is this anyway
<atomictissue>	Arch
<bazhang>	arch should have those packages
<diegoviola>	atomictissue: are you sure you don't have other audio devices on this computer?
<diegoviola>	atomictissue: what's the output of /proc/asound/cards?
<atomictissue>	 0 [PCH            ]: HDA-Intel - HDA Intel PCH                     HDA Intel PCH at 0xf7e10000 irq 30
<diegoviola>	atomictissue: what program are you using to play audio?
<atomictissue>	I tried with aplay, chrome, and gnome's sound settings
<diegoviola>	atomictissue: do you have pulseaudio-alsa installed? if not, install it
<diegoviola>	and try again
<atomictissue>	it is installes
<diegoviola>	speaker-test -t wav doesn't emit any sound?
<atomictissue>	well theres a new kernel, so maybe that will fix it?
<diegoviola>	atomictissue: oh
<diegoviola>	atomictissue: reboot first
<atomictissue>	yeah
<diegoviola>	atomictissue: and try again
<diegoviola>	atomictissue: that should fix it
<atomictissue>	well idk
<atomictissue>	this kernel update just came out in the past 20 minutes or so
<atomictissue>	but i will see
<diegoviola>	atomictissue: that usually happens with arch, when you are running a kernel and you installed another one, modules won't load / work until you reobot to the new kernel
<atomictissue>	I didn't install a new kernel until just now
<diegoviola>	atomictissue: I've had that issue with my headset too
<atomictissue>	okay
<diegoviola>	I don't think it's Arch specific issue
<atomictissue>	well I will try it now
<atomictissue>	brb
<diegoviola>	ok
<triceratux>	 0 [I82801DBICH4   ]: ICH4 - Intel 82801DB-ICH4 Intel 82801DB-ICH4 with AD1981B at irq 17 <-- id still install slack as im having zero problems
<diegoviola>	triceratux: Intel is pretty well supported on Linux in general
<diegoviola>	triceratux: I think his problem might be that the module just wasn't being loaded as he was running a different kernel, but we'll see
<triceratux>	didnt sound like it. looks like an arch/pulseaudio thing
<triceratux>	somebody bane thoze idiotz
<iflema>	2109of em?
<iflema>	XD
<diegoviola>	triceratux: well, installing a new kernel on arch will remove all the older modules
<diegoviola>	triceratux: so I think that's his problem
<iflema>	not every time
<iflema>	usually
<diegoviola>	iflema: ?
<diegoviola>	atomictissue: and? you have audio now?
<wilrnh_>	hey
*	EriC^^ is now known as bigheel
*	bigheel is now known as EriC^^
<atomictissue>	that... is extremely weird
<triceratux>	no
<triceratux>	rofl
<diegoviola>	atomictissue: ?
<diegoviola>	atomictissue: do you have audio now?
<atomictissue>	Not initially
<atomictissue>	turns out it did have to do with UEFI
<atomictissue>	I turned off CSM and bam, it works
<atomictissue>	i have no clue why but it works
<MrElendig>	csm is a pretty stupid thing
<MrElendig>	probably totally unrelated to your problem though
<atomictissue>	maybe, but it works now
<atomictissue>	I rebooted twice before disabling it, and it didn't work
<diegoviola>	atomictissue: arch removes modules and the older kernel when you install a new one
<diegoviola>	I think that was your issue
<atomictissue>	disabled it and now it does
*	triceratux has *definitely* not heard of csm & starts googling :)

<TheQuestionmark>	rofl.
<TheQuestionmark>	Nice one.
<MrElendig>	Linus must have lost it while diving
<TheQuestionmark>	I'm having issues with owncloud right now. Since I did apt-get dist-upgrade the last time for my server, Owncloud refuses both to load and to connect. The only thing coming from the clients is 'Internal server error'. Anyone knows what's wrong here?
<MrElendig>	read logs
<excalibr>	On linux how do you usually 'cluster' together individual hard disks into a single big disk. lvm?
<MrElendig>	on the server side
<MrElendig>	excalibr: raid
<pclover>	LVM or raid
<pclover>	or both
<pclover>	i use both
<TheQuestionmark>	MrElendig, Those look awesome to say the least.
<[twisti]>	when doing the traditional 'tar -xzvf; ./configure --stuff; make' thing, is there a way to print out how ./configure was last called ? i need to change an option on a piece of software i last compiled like a year ago, and i dont remember all the settings i used
<TheQuestionmark>	So many error messages...
<pclover>	why are you compiling is there no package?
<diegoviola>	what happens when you are using something like LVM or btrfs to group drives as one and then you remove say 2 or 3 drives? is your system still functional?
<pclover>	depends is the os stored on that LV if lvm?
<diegoviola>	can you add / remove drives as you need?
<diegoviola>	pclover: how do you check that usually?
<diegoviola>	where the OS is installed, etc
<pclover>	df -h?
<diegoviola>	I don't have any experience with raid
<diegoviola>	hrm
<pclover>	what are you trying to do
<[twisti]>	pclover: there is no package of the apropriate version, if your question was to me - my server is an older LTS thing that doesnt provide the relatively current feature i need
<diegoviola>	pclover: nothing. I'm just curious how it works, I don't have that raid set up myself
<pclover>	ah
<pclover>	well understand the basiscs
<pclover>	the levels
<diegoviola>	pclover: right, I'll read on it, thanks
<pclover>	[twisti], what distro?
<[twisti]>	pclover: ubuntu, LTS 12.04
<pclover>	is it just one piece of software?
<[twisti]>	yes
<irinix>	Hi guys, I have a very crappy android phone that I would like to whipe and load with a distro of actual linux....(I don't plan on using it as a phone anymore)....any suggestions on what distro to use/how to start?
<pclover>	look at the build log. Should be in there
<[twisti]>	for what its worth, ive been running it like this for months, and its perfectly fine, i would just like to add an option to the ./configure now

<toothe>	I'm having trouble getting virtualbox tools setup on Debian.
<toothe>	I installed several open-vm-tools packages, but it never seems to "work"
<MrElendig>	open-vm-tools is for vmware
<MrElendig>	you want the virtualbox guest addons
<pingfloyd>	you should be able to mount the guest addition cd inside the vm and install it
*	Doyle is now known as Berserker
<pingfloyd>	"install guest additions" in the menu should bring it in

<keegangrayson>	is there something like visual basic for linux
<pingfloyd>	yes
<pingfloyd>	not visual basic nvm
<pingfloyd>	thank god
<keegangrayson>	what, what is it?
<keegangrayson>	python basic?
<stupid-1>	not all programming language are free
<keegangrayson>	also what is the best programming language for desktop and mobile
<thegladiator>	for example miscrosoft's .net
<stupid-1>	c sharp
<thegladiator>	keegangrayson: there is nothing like that, all have their strengths ... what is your goal
<MrElendig>	thegladiator: depends on your defenition of free
<keegangrayson>	c# is better than c++?
<keegangrayson>	I want to be able to make cross-platform applications
<MrElendig>	mono is a buggy pos, so don't use .net langauges
<MrElendig>	languages*
<pingfloyd>	there's the visual studio like ide called visual studio code
<MrElendig>	keegangrayson: python
<thegladiator>	keegangrayson: all languages are good - pros and cons, for a beginner python is easy to learn
<keegangrayson>	I don't mind if I have to learn a new language, I just wanted an ide like visual basic or .net or whatever it is
<thegladiator>	Eclipse is a popular IDE
<MrElendig>	just use vim or emacs
<MrElendig>	or if you *really* want a silly ide, pycharm
<thegladiator>	thats right, pycharm if you want to try python
<MrElendig>	but really, vim/emacs does 99% of what a ide does
<keegangrayson>	but isn't vim or emacs difficult if you want to create a gui
<pingfloyd>	IDEs are crutches
<MrElendig>	keegangrayson: no
<thegladiator>	ide's dont make you a good programmer keegangrayson - you can be a good one with pen and paper
<fxmulder>	I used to use kdevelop
<JodaZ>	keegangrayson, you want to design guis?
<keegangrayson>	at least visualize guis while I program
<MrElendig>	keegangrayson: for both qt and gtk there are drag and drop designers too
<thegladiator>	but yeah if you want to have some fun interfaces try kdevelop eclipse etc :-)
<pingfloyd>	master how to compile and link from the command line
<keegangrayson>	so use python with gtk or qt?
<pingfloyd>	you'll be better off in the long run
<keegangrayson>	but then I have to visualize the gui in my mind
<MrElendig>	keegangrayson: 22:59:19  MrElendig ╡ keegangrayson: for both qt and gtk there are drag and drop designers too
<JodaZ>	keegangrayson, gtk has glade, qt has qt creator
<thegladiator>	keegangrayson: try it out and see what you like
<keegangrayson>	which is more memory efficient, gtk or qt
<JodaZ>	depends on if you are already running kde i guess
<keegangrayson>	isn't qt for kde type things and gtk for gnome or is it a moot point
<MrElendig>	qt is much more portable
<MrElendig>	keegangrayson: no
<MrElendig>	both qt and gtk can be used standalone
<thegladiator>	dart and sublime text are also good
<thegladiator>	why do you visualize gui when you program - solve the problem at hand instaed
<triceratux>	keegangrayson: as to your original question theres freebasic, openbasic, & bwbasic on linux
<keegangrayson>	what if the problem is with the user interface
<thegladiator>	oh you want to design ui's?
<keegangrayson>	well let me ask you all this, what language would land me a job in the future
<JodaZ>	neither is a language
<pingfloyd>	it's better to visualize with pen and paper
<thegladiator>	keegangrayson: java,python,.net etc have good market
<TheQuestionmark>	It's always C.
<thegladiator>	what pingfloyd said!
<pingfloyd>	make your rough sketch, then your mockup
<pingfloyd>	like a wireframe etc.
<TheQuestionmark>	Or rather, C based languages.
<thegladiator>	C if you like to be into something slighly more advanced
<thegladiator>	javascript as well to the list of job oriented languages
<pingfloyd>	designing is an iterative process
<thegladiator>	but don't go by that, master good ideas in all languages
<keegangrayson>	I see. And have any of you made small apps and either sold them or open sourced them for use on the desktop?
<TheQuestionmark>	Hello World.
<thegladiator>	so that is your goal :)
<TheQuestionmark>	keegangrayson, If anyone wants my horrible results to learn from, I offer anyone my python codes.
<keegangrayson>	I don't really know what my goal is, but I just acquired a lot of time as my girlfriend moved out and I lost my job
<TheQuestionmark>	That's a rather sad story.
<pingfloyd>	keegangrayson: start with a simple project
<keegangrayson>	No I see it as an opportunity
<pingfloyd>	keegangrayson: some simple app you want to make
<TheQuestionmark>	I'd start with Python, just because it's easy to learn and a lot of fun.
<thegladiator>	I haven't had a good idea, so not me. I say go for Python as well - its nice and easy to pick up.
<keegangrayson>	I want to solve a problem... a fun problem. Simple can be fun, but I don't want to do something many others have done.
<TheQuestionmark>	keegangrayson, But that's how programmers start.
<pingfloyd>	then draft it and flesh out every detail of how it works.  Like you may in the interim write it in pseudocode for first code draft
<thegladiator>	Languages like Python will help you program quicker with less learning curve ...
<TheQuestionmark>	That's how you start in every branch.
<Foxhoundz>	keegangrayson: learning Android programming
*	iflema hello world in asm
<keegangrayson>	I will never do asm.
<thegladiator>	Android has a good market so yeah
<keegangrayson>	python seems like the way to go... or C...
<Foxhoundz>	It doesn't even have to be a for-profit thing
<keegangrayson>	isn't android programming in java
<pingfloyd>	keegangrayson: you're not going to build the next killer app as a beginner
<thegladiator>	Android is Java
<autrilla>	C? Really?
<Foxhoundz>	I built a few android apps to solve very obscure, niche problems every day
<keegangrayson>	I don't want to build a killer app, I want to build a useful app
<autrilla>	No, Android is not Java
<autrilla>	Android uses Java for some things
<Foxhoundz>	autrilla: It's Java with a bastardized VM
<autrilla>	No, it isn't. It's mostly C
<TheQuestionmark>	I've read of people coding Android apps in Ruby.
<Foxhoundz>	It's tecnically not Java but it inherits a lot of the stdlib from the JVM
<iflema>	python not the best for starting out. maybe basic grasp of c and then python
<pingfloyd>	you'll have a chance at that after you've figured out how program many of the existing features.
<Foxhoundz>	I Believe the whole lawsuit between Oracle and Google arose from that
<autrilla>	The OS itself is not Java, a small part of it is. As I said, it's mostly C.
*	thegladiator thinks as with everything google, they take a project and clone it out till it reaches a point where it has nothing to do with original :)
<keegangrayson>	so what language do android programmers use
<keegangrayson>	I could use android studio
<Foxhoundz>	Learning Java as the virtual machine Android uses is based on the Java language
<autrilla>	If you really want to understand what you're doing you don't just need to learn a language. Yoy have to understand how your computer works. From the hardware (basic digital design, at least), to operating systems (this is linux anyway).
<triceratux>	keegangrayson: the android os uses a c based linux kernel, a c based version of uclibc, & then the apks are written in java
<autrilla>	keegangrayson: most use Java/
<Foxhoundz>	Just learn Java.
<keegangrayson>	do you think android will be around for a long time?
<Foxhoundz>	Then learn the android sdk
<Foxhoundz>	It's a free and open source platform so I would say so
<autrilla>	No, it will probably stop existing tomorrow
<TheQuestionmark>	keegangrayson, As long as Google doesn't get tired of it.
<MrElendig>	"free" and "open"
<pingfloyd>	if google got tired of it, someone would fork it
<autrilla>	TheQuestionmark: even then. It's open source.
<autrilla>	MrElendig: Android is free and open.
<autrilla>	The stuff Google does for it isn't.
<MrElendig>	autrilla: http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/10/googles-iron-grip-on-android-controlling-open-source-by-any-means-necessary/
<Foxhoundz>	MrElendig: ASOP is fully open source :)
<TheQuestionmark>	autrilla, Well, Cyanogen does kinda good job with doing their own thing.
<MrElendig>	Foxhoundz: half of it is also dead and unmaintained
<keegangrayson>	it's so difficult to know what will be popular... I started with a commodore 64 when I was 2 years old, then used Windows 3.1, 95, 98 and XP... then I switched to linux about 10 years ago. I think linux, windows, and os x will continue to grow for producers, but consumers will use os' like android.
<MrElendig>	read that ^
<Foxhoundz>	AOSP*
<MrElendig>	and it have only gotten worse since then
<autrilla>	MrElendig: tldr?
<stevejobsinhell>	moin.
<stevejobsinhell>	How can I tell what videocard I run ?
<stevejobsinhell>	err what video drivers I have installed.
<autrilla>	stevejobsinhell: look inside your case
<MrElendig>	autrilla: google is turning android into closed source as fast as they can
<autrilla>	Ah, that changes everything
<Foxhoundz>	stevejobsinhell: lspci | grep vga
<TheQuestionmark>	MrElendig, That counts for their gapps.
<autrilla>	MrElendig: they are turning some parts.
<thegladiator>	LOL comodore when you were 2 ....
<MrElendig>	autrilla: as much as they can
<autrilla>	Basically just their apps
<TheQuestionmark>	thegladiator, My dad and I played River Raid when I was at the same age.
<keegangrayson>	thegladiator: yeah I knew enough to load a few games, then we had a 300 baud modem and I used telnet
<keegangrayson>	thegladiator: I knew enough BASIC to get around
<thegladiator>	when you were 2?
<keegangrayson>	yessir
<keegangrayson>	my grandfather was an engineer
<Foxhoundz>	\o/ FreeBasic
<TheQuestionmark>	Don't expect me to be a good tho.
<keegangrayson>	it's like two year olds today using phones
<thegladiator>	seriously lol, ok perhaps ... I have no clue what I did when I was two
<TheQuestionmark>	All I could do was moving forward crashing into the next thing... I even remember that.
<stevejobsinhell>	what are the ligit nvidia drivers? nouveau
<pingfloyd>	this is why android > iphone
<cortexman>	i have a python script that is trying to start 40,000 threads. i'm on a c4.8xlarge ec2 instance (36 cpus). they start quickly up until about 200, then the rate at which they start is very slow
<keegangrayson>	android isn't exactly open source
<thegladiator>	TheQuestionmark: quite a feat if you recollect it
<cortexman>	i want all the threads to start, quickly.
<[R]>	cortexman: and i want a million dollars
<TheQuestionmark>	pingfloyd, To be fair, at least casual users don't have to worry about shitty support from either Apple (iPhone) or Microsoft (Lumia) for their devices.
<autrilla>	cortexman: WHY. JUST WHY.
<stevejobsinhell>	what linux nvidia driers are prefered for playing unreal tournament
<cortexman>	[R] i don't find that answer very helpful.
<cortexman>	why? so that i only have to wait O(1) not O(N)
<MrElendig>	stevejobsinhell: the latest that supports your card
<MrElendig>	always
<TheQuestionmark>	thegladiator, Yea... the human brain is amazing, even tho I had a tumor back then.
<autrilla>	Also your pid_max is probably under that. Mine is 32768
<cortexman>	it's an embarassingly parallel problem, but i cannot exploit that for some reason
<MrElendig>	and do not install using the .run directly from nvidia
<autrilla>	Adding more processes does not help with that
<MrElendig>	always use the build/package system your distro has
<cortexman>	is there some reason linux would be struggling with a few hundred threads
<autrilla>	many
<MrElendig>	why would you want to start 40k threads?
<stevejobsinhell>	is nojerware@localhost:~ >glxinfo | grep OpenGL
<stevejobsinhell>	OpenGL vendor string: nouveau
<stevejobsinhell>	sorry
<thegladiator>	Indeed TheQuestionmark
<cortexman>	MrElendig, it's called parallelism.
<MrElendig>	you usually get better performance by not going far over your cpu count
<autrilla>	it's called dumbness
<autrilla>	and ignorance
<MrElendig>	cortexman: no, it is called stupidity
<cortexman>	....
<cortexman>	you guys are awful
<cortexman>	do you talk to people like this in real life?
<cortexman>	holy cow
<autrilla>	says the superhypermegamultithreader
<MrElendig>	cortexman: irc is real life
<stevejobsinhell>	I mean is the open source drivers better than nvidia's own stuff ?
<cortexman>	no, it's not. being this autistic is not "real life"
<autrilla>	Is there anything other than irc?
<pl2>	good luck trying to get your system not to load that nouveau cancer
<MrElendig>	cortexman: and I do tell customers that they are doing stupid things when they are doing stupid things
<autrilla>	All I see is irc
<MrElendig>	cortexman: and they pay me money for doing so too!
<TheQuestionmark>	cortexman, In real life, I've gotta talk slow to people because no one around me understands Linux or even computers in general.
*	faye is now known as Guest82335
<cortexman>	yeah, here you don't get karma or cash so instead your a giant -
<triceratux>	cortexman: what is this real life of which you speak
<MrElendig>	cortexman: and it even saves lifes
<autrilla>	you're*
<cortexman>	there are actually academics publishing papers on why people turn into massive jerks in irc
<deniska>	40000 is a heck of a lot of threads
<autrilla>	triceratux: they say there's stuff beyond these walls of text
<TheQuestionmark>	cortexman, My netbook's Debian runs with a customized LXDE, everyone at work is like 'YOUR UBUNTU LOOKS SO DIFFERENT FROM USUAL! WHY SO?!'.
<deniska>	especially for python (GIL)
<cortexman>	deniska, yeah. at this point i just want to know why i can't do that
<keegangrayson>	if this is real life, where is everyone from?
<autrilla>	deniska: but but but paralelism!
<pingfloyd>	cortexman: because you're overloading it
<TheQuestionmark>	At least we can be somewhat nerdy in IRC.
<pingfloyd>	that's the simple answer
<autrilla>	Why stop at 40k? I'd use 400k threads, even more parallel
<cortexman>	pingfloyd what exactly is overloaded
<deniska>	cortexman: are you the one who wrote the code?
<cortexman>	autrilla, i don't have that many urls to download
<cortexman>	yes i am
<autrilla>	HAHAH
<deniska>	cortexman: can you show it on pastebin?
<MrElendig>	cortexman: just use a pool
<cortexman>	i'm short on time
<autrilla>	40k threads for network load
<cortexman>	so i'm tring to speed it up
<autrilla>	yeah mate
<MrElendig>	or better, asyncio
<autrilla>	way to go
<cortexman>	i'm on 10gb ethernet via an amazon instance
<MrElendig>	or twisted
<deniska>	or switch to golang or something
<autrilla>	asyncio or twisted as MrElendig said. Don't even try to go with thread. The GIL will rape you.
<cortexman>	where, exactly, is the problem? :)
<deniska>	which has lightweight threads with their own schedulin
<cortexman>	other options blah blah - what exactly is wrong with this one?
<autrilla>	cortexman: cat /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max
<MrElendig>	deniska: green threads sucks just as bad when you start 40k of them
<autrilla>	The overhead of forking
<autrilla>	The memory usage of having 40k processes
<pl2>	How would I get linux to boot up at a particular time?
<MrElendig>	pl2: some motherboards supports wake on rtc
<ohcanada>	pl2: if the bios supports wake on lan, you can ping it from another machine
<cortexman>	ok so the GIL is the problem. i thought that was it. is it related to the fact that all of my threads are writing results to the same dictionary?
<deniska>	MrElendig: one of early golang demos was spawning like 100k of threads to pass info to each other, demo worked in under the second
<autrilla>	I don't know much about CFS but I guess it has to iterate through every single process to check which one to schedule
<clarjon1>	pl2: Hire a servant to press the power button on te machine.
<MrElendig>	deniska: sure they spawn
<deniska>	and they pass that integer between each other, chained =)
<MrElendig>	deniska: performance might still be worse than just spawning a pool the size of your /n/ hardware threads.....
<pl2>	clarjon1, you available? whooooooooooo
<clarjon1>	pl2: Set the BIOS to boot when power is restored to the device, and get one of those outlet timers to provide power to the machine at the given time.
<MrElendig>	deniska: real life performance that is
<deniska>	MrElendig: golang spawns the pool of real OS threads
<deniska>	MrElendig: and schedules green threads on top of them
<MrElendig>	green threads are not magic free stuff
<autrilla>	100k real os threads?
<deniska>	no
<deniska>	1 real os thread in that demo
<autrilla>	There's also overhead
<autrilla>	And no reason to use it
<pl2>	MrElendig, ohcanada, didn't know you could do that. thanks for the suggestion, sounds like it would work for me
<MrElendig>	they still cost interupt, context switching etc
<MrElendig>	pl2: man 8 rtcwake
<deniska>	MrElendig: but they are magic enough to not worry about spawning large amount of routines instead of dancing around doing async stuff by hand
<jxport>	cortexman: what u making
<cortexman>	jxport i want to download and get text from tens of thousands urls fast...
<deniska>	Open an OS thread per connection and you are a crazy man, start a goroutine (or a few) per connection and that is ideomatic go =)
<MrElendig>	or you can poke /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm directly
<jxport>	deniska: excellent use of Go
<cortexman>	i have to use python
<autrilla>	Then use asyncio
<cortexman>	i have tried greenlots, multiprocessing, threading
<cortexman>	*greenlets
<MrElendig>	or treq/twisted
<autrilla>	Your network is the bottleneck, not your CPU
<autrilla>	More threads won't help
<cortexman>	the network is 10gb ethernet...
<autrilla>	They'll make it worse, even. Servers don't like handling 40k requests at once
<autrilla>	Ok, then your CPU is the bottleneck
<autrilla>	But you can't do anything about it
<cortexman>	seems like the GIL is more likely
<jxport>	cortexman: what you up to?  something malicious?
<autrilla>	Deal with it, use n or n + 1 threads
<cortexman>	the cpu is not the bottleneck, there are 36 cpus, it only uses 2
<cortexman>	downloading websites is not malicious. this is the internet
<autrilla>	I'm smelling the black hat from here
<cortexman>	i need to spider a bunch of sites for an NLP project. the more data i can get in this deadline, the better the results.
<stevejobsinhell>	That's what web browsers do.  download websites.
<autrilla>	cortexman: hitting a website 40k times at the same time _is_ malicious
<MrElendig>	hammering the same server with request for 40k files at the same time will get people mad
<cortexman>	it is 40k websites, not 1 website
<autrilla>	cortexman: use 36 or 37 threads. Not any more.
<stevejobsinhell>	not if you have 40k work stations behind NAT device.
<cortexman>	i like how you are now concerned about the ethics of my project
<stevejobsinhell>	Its the web servers fault if it can't handle being so "popular".
<autrilla>	MrElendig: and you banned, probably
<autrilla>	stevejobsinhell: yeah, with which they can deal by banning you.
<autrilla>	Doesn't the kernel have protection against process bombs?
<autrilla>	fork bomb or whatever they call them now
<jxport>	cortexman: ethics comes first breh
<prx>	I think only memory wise
<toothe>	gah! Can't get Virtualbox tools setup on Debian.
<toothe>	i tried installing open-vm-tools...no dice.
<shadok_>	autrilla: limits.conf can help
<shadok_>	autrilla: namely the nproc setting
<autrilla>	shadok_: yeah, cortexman is trying to spawn 40k threads
<shadok_>	that's pretty dumb on a single machine, using aws i'd use ec2 containers to do that
<shadok_>	or cloudformation but i don't think it's needed in this case
<shadok_>	at 40K thread i suppose you spend more time in interrupts than anything else
<shadok_>	using perf could help narrow down the bottleneck
<autrilla>	Because CFS needs to iterate through all processes?
<prx>	Spawning 40k threads might geht CPU limited before it becomes network limited becauseof the extreme amount. If you wandto push maximum packets out as fast as possible, I'd use the kernels packet generator NET_PKTGEN.
<autrilla>	german detected :p
<prx>	ACKed
*	Blashyrk1 is now known as Blashyrkh1
*	Jeroen is now known as Jeroen52
<shadok_>	autrilla: i'm not well versed in kernel stuff but the sheer number of threads seems to be "a bit" too much to me
*	Jeroen52 is now known as Jeroen
<autrilla>	shadok_: yeah, like 1000 times too much
<shadok_>	i'm not sure how much you could handle, there must be some tweaks to help but i never tried to do that, the easy way is to scale horizontally
<shadok_>	and on aws it's pretty easy to do
<autrilla>	Indeed
<pl2>	Why don't you just spawn the threads on a video card?
<pl2>	CUDA bro
<jxport>	Surely cortexman needs to have a threadpool which has its size optimized in accordance with the network capacity's usage ?
<autrilla>	jxport: he needs a thread pool with as many threads as his processor
<autrilla>	Any more won't help
<autrilla>	Then, he needs to use asyncio. httpaio is a good bet for this.
<autrilla>	I just wrote a crawler a couple of days ago because scrapy wasn't crawling, it's pretty easy to do with asyncio
<autrilla>	On my slow 5Mbit network I managed to get ~5 requests per second
<prx>	autrilla: At what average latency?
*	Blashyrk1 is now known as Jesterboxboy
<prx>	httpingoresomesuch
<autrilla>	56ms
<Jesterboxboy>	tst
<autrilla>	it managed to saturate my network
<prx>	autrilla: Ah, you pulled stuff, not only contacted the site. I needto get that "malicious" out of my head, I guess.
<autrilla>	prx: i was just crawling my own site looking for broken images
<autrilla>	prx: anyway, trying to be malicious on a 5Mbit network :d
<prx>	autrilla: Couldn't you stop the transmission (RST) instead of accepting the image transfer after it started? You still knew it was valid.
*	Blashyrk1 is now known as Blashyrkh1
<cortexman>	i found the bottleneck. it was BeautifulSoup. switched to lxml
<cortexman>	it's weird because it was only using 2 cpus
<cortexman>	it's now extremely fast.
<shadok_>	prx: on one website only i think that would be unprodutive as you'd have to restart a new tcp connection after the RST
<cortexman>	i'm going to try all the threads.
<shadok_>	TRY ALL THE THREADS!*
*	Blashyrkh1 is now known as Jesterboxboy
<xulfer>	Expat is pretty quick too :)
<prx>	shadok_: Yes, dependson the filesizes. But after hearingof images, I imagined them being quite big.
<prx>	I promise to get a new keyboard tomorrow. Sorry for missing spaces.
<autrilla>	prx: huh? The image didn't transfer
<autrilla>	I just checked the links
<shadok_>	prx: but starting a tcp connection can take a long time, you could just use HEAD request and look at the response code (and keep your connection open), that would be a better solution
<autrilla>	cortexman: BeautifulSoup uses lxml if you have it
<cortexman>	oh, i didn't test that. it wasn't installed.
<harris>	anyone here use bing rewards
<autrilla>	And I tried both and there wasn't a huge difference
<autrilla>	lxml was around 25% faster
<shadok_>	harris: you must be joking
<xulfer>	Than expat?
<prx>	autrilla: Sorry, thought you'd actually need to start a transfer to really be sure the link exists.
<harris>	you can get free gift cards
<harris>	i get $5 amazon every month
<shadok_>	harris: i think you're one of the only people to know that, in this channel and in the whole world
<autrilla>	prx: the images are also on my server, if it 404s, it's broken. Also, the upstream server replaces broken images with a default image, so I just needed to search for the default image name in the html
<harris>	shadok_, do you want a referal link
<autrilla>	hahaha
<shadok_>	harris: not at all, i don't have a ms account anyway
<pingfloyd>	you're selling your information for $5/month
<cortexman>	autrilla i'm quite sure it's lxml vs beautifulsoup. perhaps lxml avoids the gil
<harris>	pingfloyd, i use a bot to search
<autrilla>	cortexman: lxml does not avoid the gil
<shadok_>	they are so desperate :/ "Earn credits searching the web with Bing—similar to a frequent flyer program. Redeem credits for popular gift cards or even donate them to a charity of your choice. All you have to do is stay signed-in as you search with Bing."
<autrilla>	cortexman: do you want me to share my crawler code?
<pingfloyd>	i.e., make sure we can attach an identity to your searches
<autrilla>	pingfloyd: I give it Google in exchange for an excellent service
<pingfloyd>	autrilla: what?
<autrilla>	My information
<cortexman>	autrilla, here is the crawler portion. warning: it's gross one-off code. https://gist.github.com/brianmingus/ede0be65ba79c5023d87

<prx>	autrilla: Thanks, that explains it. I thought of external servers. Or I am missing some HTTP.
<autrilla>	Oh god
<xreal>	Am I stupid? Shouldn't "cp -al test test2" create a link from test2 to test ?
<shadok_>	"Redeem credits for rewards in the Redemption Center. " <- really MS? "Redemption Center"

*	shadok_ is now known as shadok
<sauvin>	I'd rather have a few long lines than bazillions of small ones.
<autrilla>	sauvin: the video is not about line length limits. It's against them.
<autrilla>	It's about people focusing too much about line lenghts and too little on the actual code
<prx>	Must be a JAVA developer in need of longer variable names...
<sauvin>	Oh, my mistake. I meant long lines HERE. Yea, when dealing with source, long lines can be a buggery.
<prx>	Long lines in IRC are bad? oO Because of tl;dr or what?
<pingfloyd>	prx: because people can't wait to go to the bathroom
<sauvin>	Specifically what I often object to are people who hit the ENTER key with each sentence subfragment.
<autrilla>	No, they're good. sauvin means he prefers people to write a long line than hit enter every three words
<sauvin>	It can get to be
<sauvin>	a bit
<sauvin>	irritating
<pingfloyd>	or at least have a sentence per line
<prx>	pingfloyd: Well, thats the case when waiting for an answer in an idle channel ;)

<shadok>	ceil: i don't understand the link between a clone of google docs and amazon
<ceil>	xulfer: hence my plan to get a Windows laptop...
<autrilla>	xulfer: the libreoffice/openoffice UIs suck. Real bad.
<xulfer>	I don't think people are all that interested in reimplementing word
<ceil>	shadok: Amazon being where i work
<Snader_LB>	coolbeans51: several, but this was a question relating to Fedoea
<Snader_LB>	coolbeans51: Fedora *
<shadok>	ceil: ohh, ok
<coolbeans51>	autrilla:  err no. they dont actually.
<autrilla>	Err yes, they do
<xulfer>	Ibm office stuff is used pretty heavily as well
<ceil>	they really do
<shadok>	ceil: clearly you don't have the choice of your tools then
<xulfer>	So if you're lucky you get that
<ceil>	shadok: indeed : (
<xreal>	Froolap: "hard link files instead of copying" => http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cp.1.html
<ceil>	`ln` ftw
<autrilla>	Too bad they can't implement the ribbon UI due to IP crap
<ceil>	autrilla: word
<xreal>	Froolap: in any man I can find, it's "-l" or "--link".
<ceil>	it took some getting used to, but i do appreciate the ribbon now
<shadok>	ceil: at least in common corporation you can generally sneak a debian install on your desktop, that's not the case on those big corps
<xulfer>	Not sure what ribbon is
<autrilla>	The stuff on top of Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc.
<ceil>	shadok: yeah, i think some corporate employees use mac books, but that's about it. pretty sure everyone at the fulfillment centers is on Windows 7, though
<shadok>	xulfer: i suppose it's a contextual thingy, i loathe those
<xreal>	This must be a bug on several distributions
<reisio>	I know you aren't praising the ribbon :p
<coolbeans51>	autrilla: im glad they dont have the ribbon tbh. that thing makes u go insane
<shadok>	ceil: try getting a mac and install linux with a theme ^^

<autrilla>	reisio: there is
<reisio>	there isn't
<autrilla>	reisio: as I said, IP crap.
<xulfer>	Even the atmel studio is worse than the open source tools
<reisio>	autrilla: nope
<xulfer>	Imo
<autrilla>	Yep
<reisio>	nope
<reisio>	it's a toolbar
<reisio>	an awful one
<prx>	xulfer: Are you actually developing Code on the target then?
<reisio>	and office suites are all awful :p
<shadok>	xulfer: i was tight, it's the contextual crap in office for example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribbon_%28computing%29#/media/File:Office2007ribbon.png
<autrilla>	reisio: a patented toolbar
<reisio>	you can patent anything
<xulfer>	Never on the target.  I cross compile
<reisio>	doesn't mean you can stop people from making it without paying you
<autrilla>	reisio: of course. Hence the word crap
<prx>	xulfer: then you coulduse windows.
<reisio>	moreover, suing people without money is pointless
<xulfer>	And the tool chain on *nix is better and produces better code most of the time
<autrilla>	It isn't
<reisio>	sure it is
<reisio>	it does nothing
<prx>	xulfer: What toolchain is this?
<autrilla>	If those people are taking your customers it isn't
<reisio>	but waste your own money
<xulfer>	Hint: I don't use lunar I either
<xulfer>	Iinaro
<reisio>	if I didn't think the ribbon and office suites in general were daft, I'd write one up and put it online just to prove you wrong :p
<autrilla>	Which is what would happen if libreoffice had the same UI as Office
<xulfer>	Atmel mostly.  Sometimes arm for high level but I'm not as familiar with arm
<reisio>	nothing would happen
<reisio>	except libreoffice users would complain
<reisio>	because it's stupid
<xulfer>	I rarely get to use something that strong
<ceil>	lol
<ohcanada>	ceil: i thought amazon were almost entirely an ubuntu outfit, with their main web app being csc running on firefox, or chrome for mayday
<prx>	xulfer: At least you can use GCC and all that in Win, too. So I do not get the toolchain difference.
<xulfer>	Depends on the version
<autrilla>	reisio: I find the libreoffice toolbar way worse than the ribbon
<reisio>	they're both awful, but both can be implemented without any risk
<prx>	xulfer: Right, windows releases lag behind a bit.
<xulfer>	Perhaps you're thinking of a Cygwin compiled new version which could work
<xulfer>	But I'm not going to try to get yocto working on that for high end stuff
<xulfer>	Or buildroot
<prx>	xulfer: Windows without cygwin sucks;)
<autrilla>	reisio: MS asks for a license to use it for non-competing products, and people pay. Why would they/
<reisio>	ms asks for a lot of things they won't or can't get
*	autrilla doesn't use Cygwin
<reisio>	they kind of suck at playing by the rules
<autrilla>	reisio: they do get it
<xulfer>	But yocto is my go to now
<ceil>	ohcanada: at the fulfillment centers, a lot of the backend is on linux (lol CentOS 5.1 iirc), but all the user-facing stuff and managerial programs that i have to use are Windows
<reisio>	look at the hyper-v drivers fiasco
<reisio>	they're clowns :p
<xulfer>	So I don't have to write so many custom packages
<reisio>	they have no idea even how to remain consistently devious
<xulfer>	And can just write a new bsp and be done
<ceil>	ohcanada: even our Java 'Maintenance Manager' app that we use to control the robots can only run on Windows for some reason (so the IT department tells me)
<xreal>	I hate man files, they're lying :(

<autrilla>	I can't support those who are against nonfree software. Someone else wrote it. Either use it or don't but stop telling them their software should be free
<ohcanada>	ceil: i suppose you must be right. remind me what csc stands for again
<billy71>	I mean, it combines the things that a debian package build system does with installing it in the same moment.
<billy71>	Does that make sense? Should I do this for all of the software I use?

<reisio>	because that is the dumbest thing ever
<xulfer>	I personally don't *hate* systemd but I think it tries to do too much
<Fun>	 As of version 219, systemd-udevd executes RUN+= scripts while keeping new devices in a state that makes mount fail silently, without any error result value or other diagnostic
<xulfer>	And it fixes problems no one wanted fixed
<]>	xulfer, here you go, a systemd replacement for you http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V1/init.s
<autrilla>	Well then, don't use it. What's the problem?
<Fun>	autrilla: problem it may crash os?
<Fun>	or not?
<xulfer>	Not exactly cross platform
<reisio>	the problem is people saying to use it
<Evidlo>	With systemd I can write inits that actually work
<xulfer>	I can do that with initd
<Fun>	initd is nice
<Evidlo>	I coudn't

<Fun>	Evidlo: why
<xulfer>	And we deploy on like 30 different devices
<Evidlo>	Fun: because I suck
<Fun>	Evidlo: well here some people are very smart
<xulfer>	Well I fail to see how it's scripts are easier
<Fun>	i find often i can ask advice on irc
<xulfer>	To me if you know how to write a shell script you can write an init script
<Fun>	xulfer: its just basic coding right?
<Fun>	to tell soft what to do
<ohcanada>	its* is the correct possessive pronoun
<xulfer>	If you can't write a shell script then maybe don't try to write inits?

<pingfloyd>	hackergirl: also check this out http://www.openprinting.org/printers
<C0MPAQ>	hackergirl: are you really using your IRC client with root or is that a joke?
<hackergirl>	oh sweet
<pingfloyd>	great database for looking up compatibility
<pingfloyd>	as well as any issue that have been encountered
<hackergirl>	:)
<]>	C0MPAQ, you can set that to anything
<C0MPAQ>	]: that's why I asked
<]>	no response, bad sign? :P
*	C0MPAQ prepares buffer overflow exploit
<billy71>	So I got a *.service file (for systemd) - how can I install it? The reason is that the project/repo Makefile doesn't include a routine for copying it over. So I have to do it manually. That's the reason why I ask.
<hackergirl>	compaq I know yes in as root don't really care that much i suppose, lazy really yes i know it's bad
<billy71>	So I just copy the *.service file into a directory? Or symlink it - apache2-style?
<C0MPAQ>	to steal the sexy pictures
<reisio>	sexy pictures are the best kind
<]>	reisio, I thought they're the sexy kind
<pingfloyd>	hackergirl: one word of advice, is use your distro's packages for the drivers where possible
<reisio>	they're both
<C0MPAQ>	hackergirl: are you 15 years old?
<billy71>	anyone? :/
<sauvin>	Don't ask; don't tell.
<hackergirl>	haha
<hackergirl>	no I'm not 15
<]>	damn these 14 year olds on IRC
<annihilannic>	billy71: Loos like they belong in /lib/systemd/system/
<annihilannic>	*Looks
<billy71>	annihilannic: thanks.
<billy71>	Los systemd-los
<pingfloyd>	you're as old as you act on irc
<]>	billy71, service files go into .config/systemd/user or /etc/systemd
<billy71>	]: aha
<]>	you install it by using systemctl enable
<hackergirl>	I was hoping to get on here with an old amiga for nostalgia
<reisio>	what a coincindence, I was hoping to eat cereal later
<pingfloyd>	do you have an amiga?
<hackergirl>	Yeah I do so awesome
<pingfloyd>	which model
<annihilannic>	]: seems to me they go in /lib/systemd/system, and enabling them creates a symlink from /etc/systemd/system
<hackergirl>	commodore 64
<Fun>	hackergirl: whats your name?
<]>	annihilannic, those are system files, never put anything into /lib manually
<hackergirl>	My real name is Lily just looking for friendly chat
<reisio>	my real name is Cthulhu
<reisio>	I like walks on the beach
<Fun>	cool
<reisio>	but it has to be more than one walk, or I get angry
<hackergirl>	I just love technology, have a raspberry pi, arduino, I do a lot of programming in C, C++, Java, Python etc great fun
<C0MPAQ>	hackergirl: when I was 15 I dreamed of a girl into programming
<hackergirl>	haha
<C0MPAQ>	hackergirl: but now I am 28 and it never happened
<Fun>	hackergirl: whats fun in coding?
<Fun>	for example in rain there is fun
<Fun>	in nature
<]>	what the hell happened to ##linux
<billy71>	I am such a great hacker, I need CCW for my smartphone.
<hackergirl>	I have a base 64 encoder and decoder on github I wrote does custom character sets
<billy71>	8)
<annihilannic>	What's the dpkg equivalent of 'rpm -qal | grep somefilename'?  Can you do a --listfiles of all packages somehow?
<billy71>	annihilannic: dpkg --get-selection
<billy71>	something like that
<hackergirl>	the standard base64 package wasn't doing it for me it doesn't handle remainder bits
<billy71>	dpkg --get-selections
<billy71>	dpkg --get-selections | grep ...
<billy71>	that's what I use though
<Fun>	hackergirl: lily do u use python?
<annihilannic>	billy71: no, I want to list the files in the packages, not the package names
<billy71>	annihilannic: apt-file is your best friend then
<billy71>	annihilannic: apt-get install apt-file
<billy71>	apt-file update
<billy71>	apt-file search ...
<hackergirl>	Compaq yeah well im 28 too and it's hard to find ppl into programmig it sucks
<pingfloyd>	annihilannic: dpkg -L
<pingfloyd>	if the package is installed
<hackergirl>	fun yes
<annihilannic>	pingfloyd: does it have a --all argument or something though?
<pingfloyd>	otherwise you can use apt-file search
<Fun>	ty
<hackergirl>	I was just doing wifi packet analysis in the python library scapy today great fun
<pingfloyd>	annihilannic: what does that arg do?
<NeoGeo64>	hackergirl: i love programm8ng
<NeoGeo64>	i use cod::blocks
<annihilannic>	pingfloyd: for all packages, like rpm -a
<NeoGeo64>	codeZ::blocks
<atom138>	hackergirl are you a netsec student?
<hackergirl>	I used Dev C++ before codeblocks
<NeoGeo64>	code::blocks *** sorry
<hackergirl>	haha I'm no student
<pingfloyd>	annihilannic: do you want to find out which package a file belongs to?
<Fun>	I am kid
<annihilannic>	pingfloyd: yes.
<atom138>	oh my apologies grand bit wizardess
<Fun>	:P
<pingfloyd>	annihilannic: apt-file search
<atom138>	XD
<billy71>	systemctl enable whatever.service    <- where must be the service file located to be usable by this command?
<NeoGeo64>	i freakin injured my right hand by sleeping on it wrong
<NeoGeo64>	now its hard to type with both hands
<NeoGeo64>	:(\
<Fun>	NeoGeo64: post image
<C0MPAQ>	hackergirl: how sexy would you rate Alan Cox?
<atom138>	Are you accepting applications for padawans?
<hackergirl>	I love codeblocks though much better than DevC++ just admit it DevC++ was terrible
<reisio>	windows things are terrible
<NeoGeo64>	welll... codeblocks works great on my OS of choice... Linux Mint Cinnamon 64 bit
<reisio>	cinnamon is a wonderful spice
<hackergirl>	lol on a 1-10 scale probably a 1 but when I took some computer science at uni all men looked like that big beards and socially inept  lol
<NeoGeo64>	i dont even run windows.  me entire 1tb HDD is formatted as ext4
<reisio>	social ineptitude is underrated
<reisio>	who'd want to be good at interacting with _this_ society :p
<atom138>	Cinnamon is best enjoyed by the spoonful
<NeoGeo64>	i took a cs class too
<reisio>	atom138: only less dry
<annihilannic>	billy71,pingfloyd: thanks... surprised I have to install something to do that!  hmm... it seems to be downloading stuff, I only wanted to search installed packages.
<atom138>	yeah a shot of everclear goes well
<NeoGeo64>	i wasnt good at is but i l;earned soome things
<hackergirl>	not to be mean or anything we like confidence and socially un-inept ppl mostly lol just a girl thing
<billy71>	annihilannic: apt-file is pretty fast
<billy71>	annihilannic: you can use the debian web search for files
<billy71>	no need for installing extra
<pingfloyd>	annihilannic: you want to update the cache once in a while too: apt-file update
<reisio>	that's not a girl thing, it's just a thing
<atom138>	human is the word i think youre looking for
<NeoGeo64>	hackergirl: On Windows 8.1 ?
<hackergirl>	haha isn't it :)
<hackergirl>	hahah omg i hate windows 8.1
<atom138>	yeah me too I regret installing it
<hackergirl>	i keep clicking the start menu and boom then im touching the screen like why isn't it moving? but yeah it's god aweful
<reisio>	let's not talk about it :p
<Fun>	its a mask
<atom138>	I dont mind the start menu as much as i hate how they broke all my poweruser keyboard shortcuts
<reisio>	poweruser on windows
<NeoGeo64>	lol hackergirl use Linux!
<reisio>	good joke
<hackergirl>	The closest thing i have to windows 8.1 is a virtual instance of windows server 2012 R2 and I hate that too
*	annihilannic still waiting for apt-file to download megabytes of stuff 
<atom138>	yep that was infact the joke
<pingfloyd>	good thing you can change all that easily on linux
<NeoGeo64>	Linux isnt just a geek OS anymore
<billy71>	annihilannic: you can use the debian web search!!!
<atom138>	it hasnt been for...well since a while
<NeoGeo64>	its a really nice OS I use it exclusive
<billy71>	annihilannic: https://packages.debian.org/index
<hackergirl>	Linux is really user friendly expecially ubuntu anyone can use it there is like a gui for everything even software
<billy71>	annihilannic: "Search the contents of packages"
<atom138>	I wouldnt use the term geek OS as much as I would use nightmare desktop environment
<billy71>	linux is not a gui, os or desktop but a kernel
*	NeoGeo64 doesn't really care for Ubuntu
<annihilannic>	billy71: But I don't want to do an "available packages" type of search... I just want to know which package on my local system a file belongs to.  Should be as easy as 'rpm -qf /path/to/file' really!
<atom138>	xwindows
*	NeoGeo64 used to
<atom138>	unix
<hackergirl>	I don't care for it much either I wasn't a fan of the unity thing they have going
<billy71>	annihilannic: ah!
<billy71>	annihilannic: locate command
<billy71>	locate <file>
<billy71>	looks like magic, don't be scared
<NeoGeo64>	yeah ! I don't like Unity... thats whatstopped me from using it... altho Ubuntu made Liunx Mint possible
<annihilannic>	billy71: Ah, found it, dpkg --search /path/to/file.
<billy71>	aha
<annihilannic>	billy71: that's different, that tells me *where* a file is.
<atom138>	Are you all using linux as 'daily driver'
<atom138>	ie right now
<NeoGeo64>	Like Mint Ciianmon is all I need.  I installed this distro back in December and it is still going strong!!
<NeoGeo64>	ext4 >  NTFS
<billy71>	annihilannic: right
<billy71>	annihilannic: ah, I get it
*	sauvin uses linux and has no trouble with KDE.
<billy71>	you want to know what package it belongs to
<hackergirl>	NeoGeo64 yeah I did have mint for awhile probably 5 years ago I liked it a lot more than ubuntu
<billy71>	systemctl enable whatever
<annihilannic>	billy71: yep, perhaps I phrased my question a**eways ;-)
<atom138>	Whats the best distro out now as far as day to day desktop environment?
<billy71>	annihilannic: np, you learned about apt-file now which is awesome
<NeoGeo64>	hackergirl: what distro do you use now, if any?
<Fun>	ubuntu
<atom138>	I just recently dove into linux with school
<]>	triceratux, it actually seems samba is one of the culprits, it's constantly spewing "unable to open printcap" in the journal
<hackergirl>	I'm using Kali Linux which is a port of Debian Wheezy
<billy71>	systemctl enable whatever     <- where do I have to put the whatever.service file on the system so systemctl can find it?!
<Dr-007>	atom138, xubuntu
<atom138>	But only server and IDS stuff
<billy71>	kali linux, like debian, is great
<sauvin>	Guh, Kali is an abortion.
<billy71>	systemctl enable whatever     <- where do I have to put the whatever.service file on the system so systemctl can find it?!
<reisio>	mmm, abortions
<Dr-007>	billy71, try rc.local
<]>	billy71, /etc/systemd/system/
<Fun>	who here likes to use Radha linux?
<hackergirl>	Yes ever since they moved from backtrack to kali linux and went debian at first I was pissed but now I realize how much better it is
<Fun>	:)
<atom138>	I have kali on a laptop I used for my final last quarter but most of my experience is with sles and securityonion
<Dr-007>	billy71,  listen to ] which seems more elegance
<sauvin>	It doesn't matter how much "better" it is, it's still an abortion.
<billy71>	]: ok
<atom138>	hackergirl have you fooled around with blackarch?
<billy71>	]: Failed to execute operation: No such file or directory
<billy71>	:/
<hackergirl>	atom138, no i haven't actually might be intereting to look into
<]>	billy71, what operation
<billy71>	cp ocserv.s* /etc/systemd/system/
<atom138>	what do you mean by abortion?
<hackergirl>	how is it?
<]>	billy71, make the system dir if its not there
<billy71>	sudo systemctl enable ocserv
<atom138>	It reminds me of the older versions of backtrack
<billy71>	oh
<sauvin>	I mean the goddamn thing is NOT a desktop distro. It crashes a lot.
*	pingfloyd blows a whistle and oomp loompas appear
<Fun>	hackergirl: can a dating soft be coded in python?
<Fun>	something simple and runs on laptop
<triceratux>	]: that sounds about right. theres some systemd / samba coupling to google :)
<Fun>	I love dating and coding I dislike on emotional level
<atom138>	Blackarch is more back to the basics
<hackergirl>	Fun, you want to host a dating site? I'm not quite sure what you want lol but yes python can be used as part of a web server aka LAMP the P being python perl php etc
<]>	billy71, read man systemd.unit for more info, there you will see "/etc/systemd/system/*"
<annihilannic>	I'm seeing pieces of systemd on Ubuntu 14.04LTS, but not all of it (lacks 'systemctl' for example)... is that because it's primarily upstart based and just has some systemd-compatibility stubs lying around?
<billy71>	]: aha
<Strat>	guys what is the command for proper syncing my internal hdd to my external hdd? I've used it before but haven't used it in a while and completely forgot
<ayecee>	annihilannic: 14.04 used upstart, not systemd
<Strat>	i only want to sync the changed files
<]>	Strat, rsync
<ayecee>	annihilannic: which pieces of systemd are you seeing?
<Strat>	GREAt, thank you ]
<Strat>	that's the one! :)
<annihilannic>	ayecee: systemd-udevd and systemd-logind are running.
<ayecee>	huh
<billy71>	]: /etc/systemd/system/ocserv.service
<annihilannic>	ayecee: and some stuff in /etc/systemd, /lib/systemd
<]>	annihilannic, systemd is not just an init systemd
<]>	annihilannic, system*
<]>	annihilannic, it has many parts, most of which are unrelated to init
<hackergirl>	Fun, lol dating has emotions lol get used to it haha I program but have emotions still
<annihilannic>	]: and it's not an all-or-none installation?
<]>	correct
<ayecee>	annihilannic: i don't recall seeing that, but i don't really have a 14.04 system lying around to reference :)
<]>	annihilannic, even debian-wheezy had parts of systemd in it
<ayecee>	annihilannic: correct, the pieces can be used independantly or together.
<Fun>	hackergirl: well and my personality emotional responce to coding is - its BS
<billy71>	systemd will become the next kernel
<Fun>	:)
<billy71>	amazing
<Fun>	however since I am here maybe i can try to make it fun
<]>	ayecee, have you witnessed my mispaste blunder?
<ayecee>	]: i was there
<]>	:(
*	] is not good at computer
<ayecee>	it was like lol
<annihilannic>	]: I wasn't... show us again!
<billy71>	]: So I put the service file into /etc/systemd - but systemctl still cannot find it :/
<]>	annihilannic, I'll get banned for that if I do it again
<]>	billy71, not etc/systemd its /etc/systemd/system/
<Fun>	who here spent 3 ways with 0 pc, internet and mobile?
<annihilannic>	]: A small sacrifice for the cause of entertainment
<hackergirl>	Fun, It's really fun to learn to code, you learn so much on how the world works. If you really want to get down to how computers work try assembly language all kinds of things you will learn how int_0x80 is a system inttrupt which causes previous arguments to be executed and learn about all the registers eip, esp, esi, so much wonderful knowlege waiting to be learned. Then if you really want more go into how logic circuits work, then maybe lear
<Fun>	3 days
<billy71>	]: /etc/systemd/system/ocserv.service

<]>	thats the whole point of LFS
<tm512>	I don't know which modules the kernel wants to be able to mount root
<]>	if you don't know, how are you including them in your initramfs?
<DarkElement>	How can I save a text file as a log file with wget, and how can I save all the txt files in a directory(which it will go through with "-r") as one text file?
<tm512>	I'm just copying every module I've built into the initramfs
<]>	tm512, anyway, as I said ... http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/postlfs/initramfs.html "a custom kernel is normally built. In this situation, an initramfs is rarely needed. "
<tm512>	I tried with building sd_mod, libata, ext4 all into the kernel
<tm512>	it failed to mount rootfs
<]>	hmm
<tm512>	instead of playing a guessing game and wasting my time with constant reboots and rebuilds, I'd rather just put everything into an initrd (but now that is giving issues)
<]>	and you put everything you built into the initramfs? maybe you need to build something more
<tm512>	the initramfs isn't even working
<tm512>	it doesn't get to attempt the mount
<]>	how are you booting into the initramfs?
<tm512>	by telling syslinux to use it
<]>	mmmh
<]>	tm512, did you set up init properly? like in that link
<dfzxh>	i have two shells both with DISPLAY set to ":1". one shell can launch X programs properly, the other complains it "cannot open display: "
<]>	dfzxh, try echo "'$DISPLAY'" in both, is it correct?
<tm512>	this is /init in the initramfs: http://sprunge.us/jIcf
<dfzxh>	]: yes
<tm512>	it doesn't run
<dfzxh>	]: they both respond with ':1'
<]>	dfzxh, are both users in both shells the same?
<dfzxh>	]: yep
<]>	tm512, then I don't know :( it looks alright
<DarkElement>	nvm, im fine
<Fun>	folks which editor in linux uses tabs
<Fun>	like FF?
<]>	tm512, try replacing /bin/mksh with /bin/sh
<]>	Fun, vim can use tabs
<Fun>	more like notepad +
<Fun>	moar gui :D
<tm512>	I didn't put a /bin/sh in the initramfs
<]>	gvim then
<Dr-007>	this is a network question; if i've enlarged my subnet mask pool via /etc/network/interfaces to 255.255.0.0 and the dhcp server aswell (enlarging the pool). does this mean i would have to increate the netmask in /etc/networks aswell? by default this is 169.254.0.0
<tm512>	/bin/mksh is statically linked with musl, though
<Dr-007>	should this now be 169.0.0.0
<tm512>	it should work
<Fun>	ok sublime text
<Fun>	oki I see VIM
<Fun>	is not VI
<Fun>	cool
<triceratux>	]: btw i dont do systemd or samba or owncloud or cups but this is what youre seeing https://bbs.arkos.io/t/solved-owncloud-on-cubietruck-connecting-client-asks-for-certificate-and-stops/1597/7 https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=70386
<triceratux>	]: welcome to journalctl
<]>	ugh
<]>	printcap name = /dev/null
<]>	:D
<annihilannic>	dfzxh: late to this one, but is DISPLAY exported in both shells?
<wh0isthis>	apt-get dist-upgrade
<wh0isthis>	what is this command doing?
<annihilannic>	wh0isthis: not sure of the exact definition, but it seems to do the same as 'apt-get upgrade' plus any packages that are usually "held back", for e.g. the kernel.

<]>	dfzxh, doesnt groff do that?
<ayecee>	kind of a pyrrhic victory, but whatever
<]>	hmm I might be thinking of something else
<Loshki>	dfzxh: fmt will format simple text. Emacs of course, does it all...
<]>	although man roff says its used to format man pages
<dfzxh>	]: Loshki: actually, just found out about the "fold" command
<frank1e>	guys I have 2 folders and a file which need to have changed chmod permissions. but I've locked myself out of permission to change the chmod... :/ any ideas?
<]>	dfzxh, great
<dfzxh>	]: Loshki: 'fold -w 80 -s source.txt' will print out a word wrapped version to 80 col width
<dfzxh>	gotta love nix
<]>	dfzxh, I usually use vim, set textwidth=80 linebreak and then gqG
<annihilannic>	dfzxh: For PDFs I use a handy tool called pdfsam (PDF split and merge), Java cross-platform
<]>	ayecee, have you ever used groff/roff?
<dfzxh>	annihilannic: i see. i actually found the 'pdfjoin' command which was installed by default
<ayecee>	]: not intentionally
<]>	I thought I knew what it does, but then I read the man page and now I'm not sure at all
<C0MPAQ>	ayecee: seriously, the girl in the video
<C0MPAQ>	ayecee: don't you just want to marry her?
<dfzxh>	]: so you would say that the man page made you less informed
<ayecee>	it formats text, that's about all i know
<]>	according to the man page it formats (among other things), books, documentation, standards, coroporate documents and is better than "commercial systems"
<C0MPAQ>	the anti-autism drugs are not working
<C0MPAQ>	maybe I should take more
<Loshki>	]: *roff want roff source. It's basically yet another mark-up language, pre-html.
<zorak8>	i want to install a linux server in an old computer to use with ssh
<zorak8>	what distro can i use?
<zorak8>	i was thinking in parabola
<ayecee>	zorak8: ubuntu
<]>	Loshki, yet another markup language? it was developed in the 70s, its probably *the* markup language
<dfzxh>	zorak8: slackware
<dfzxh>	zorak8: thats exactly what slackware is for
<Loshki>	If it's old, use a distro for smaller, older machines. They all have ssh...
<]>	Loshki, actually, the 60s*
<ayecee>	*that's all that slackware is good for
<tm512>	OpenBSD ;)
<dfzxh>	is openbsd a viable alternative to windows 7
<Loshki>	]: I wrote my undergraduate thesis in nroff. I'm *that* old...
<dfzxh>	what are your guys thoughts
<]>	Loshki, o.O
<]>	Loshki, not in tex?
<annihilannic>	dfzxh: not a very good question.... alternative for what??
<ayecee>	Loshki: whoa. your undergrad was before tex? :D
<]>	damn you ayecee
<dfzxh>	Loshki: whats your undergrad in
<Loshki>	dfzxh: BSc Experimental Psych, 1978.
<dfzxh>	Loshki: groovy
<]>	you might be the oldest person in ##linux
<zorak8>	i want something that dont even have X
<Loshki>	]: :-)
<dfzxh>	zorak8: tom's root boot
<]>	zorak8, install any distro, remove X
<zorak8>	X is the name of the graphic enviroment, not?
<dfzxh>	zorak8: tom's root boot http://www.toms.net/rb/ do it
<tm512>	if you have to be asking these questions, you should just use ubuntu
<tm512>	it's fairly user friendly
<tm512>	and has a version targeted at servers
<porjo>	I have an issue where rules are being inserted/removed from iptables and I so far can't figure out what is causing this. Iptables is not being used otherwise i.e. after boot it it has a blank ruleset. Wondering how best to troubleshoot this? Is there some sort of hook I can create into iptables that will show me what process is calling it?
<Loshki>	zorak8: no-one *has* to run X, unless you want graphics. For what you want, there's barely any difference between distros.
<tm512>	]: I have a hunch about what was causing the init problem. very unrelated error message though
<]>	tm512, what is it
<tm512>	investigating the rootfs that I was using to boot without an initrd in qemu, I noticed that I had /dev/console
<zorak8>	tm512: i already use linux as an user for 5+ years, dont like ubuntu, and want to learn more about admin linux server and that.
<]>	zorak8, just use any distro, there isnt a magical distro that will teach you secret linux admin skills
<tm512>	and /init wasn't creating it, which could cause failure, as I've read in the kernel docs
<tm512>	I assume I wasn't seeing any output because /dev/console was non-existant and I wasn't setting console=/dev/tty
<stonner>	anyone knows about GNU HURD?
<]>	tm512, mknod -m 640 $WDIR/dev/console c 5 1
<stonner>	is it stable?
<]>	tm512, from the LFS guide
<ayecee>	stonner: there is a #hurd irc channel on freenode
<stonner>	ayecee: thx
<tm512>	]: I guess it's worth mentioning that I'm not following LFS for this, I just don't know what else I would call a linux setup that is done from scratch
<]>	tm512, is it some kind of embedded system you're working on?
<tm512>	no, though it could be suitable for one, I think
<tm512>	it's linux with musl libc, and sbase/ubase instead of GNU coreutils and util-linux
<]>	now now, how will you ever survive without systemd? :-P
<tm512>	easily
<]>	triceratux, I fixed some samba stuff and now it's not constantly screaming at me in journald, I hope this fixes the problem
*	ziddey_ is now known as ziddey
<tm512>	this still isn't working
<triceratux>	]: the way those services get started it looks like they sometimes have to have their logging finetuned or journald goes apes*it. glad youre spotting it
<]>	tm512, even though you're not following LFS, it might be worthwile to take a look at it to see what they do differently
<]>	might spot the bug then
<unicodesnowman>	i need to write a new script that "sudo rm -rf /" if systemd is detected
<dfzxh>	unicodesnowman: you have 10 minutes to give me 10 solid technical reasons why systemd is inferior
<]>	unicodesnowman, good luck finding any distro that doesnt any systemd component or library
<annihilannic>	unfortunately boycott-systemd.org is down now, but you can refer to a copy of it at without-systemd.org ;-)
<unicodesnowman>	dfzxh, design of systemd and component is monolithic and makes it difficult for users to pick and choose components of systemd
<unicodesnowman>	dfzxh, (2) binary journal logging format makes traditional "cat ... | grep blah" involve one more call and point of failure
<unicodesnowman>	dfzxh, (3) slower performance on Arch Linux, tested on a raspberry pi. speaking from personal benchmarking
<dfzxh>	unicodesnowman: pretty sure it can log to text as well, as well as logging to rsyslog if you prefer
<]>	unicodesnowman, cat file | grep blah is simply replaced with journald | grep blah , invalid argument
<]>	and yes it can use rsyslog
<dfzxh>	unicodesnowman: my personal benchmarking has shown it faster on both my x86 and arm devices
<]>	unicodesnowman, systemd isnt monolithic either
<unicodesnowman>	dfzxh, (4) rsyslog passthrough still involves a point of failure
<unicodesnowman>	], please explain how I can use logind without systemd
<unicodesnowman>	or networkd without systemd
<unicodesnowman>	I can use network-manager with sysvinit or upstart.
<unicodesnowman>	heck, probably even launchd
<]>	unicodesnowman, the question doesnt make sense "please explain how to use a car engine without the rest of the car"
<ayecee>	i was on the fence until i read boycottsystemd.org, and realized how silly and emotional most of the arguments were.
<unicodesnowman>	], please explain how user account management / login is part of an init system's responsibilities
<[R]>	]: whats with the lowercase nick... or is it uppercase... i can never remember
<]>	unicodesnowman, do you know what pam is?
<[R]>	]: you're mom is pam
<]>	unicodesnowman, its very useful to integrate that into the init system and its responsibilities
<]>	[R], its lowercase
<]>	[R], I was in #perl but I got highlighted too much
<[R]>	your client is stupid if it highlights ] differnelty from }
<unicodesnowman>	or, how is network management, package installation, etc?
<unicodesnowman>	what about udev? pulseaudio (going systemd-only too)?
<unicodesnowman>	], yes, I have been using linux for longer than 4 days
<unicodesnowman>	i know what pam is.
<]>	my client highlights what i tell it to highlight
<unicodesnowman>	], that may be a valid consideration, however that is still monolithic
<[R]>	lol
<[R]>	but its the same letter!
<tm512>	init has one job and can be implemented in less than 100 lines of code. service management is a job for something else
<tm512>	login management is a job for something else
<tm512>	device node management is a job for something else
<[R]>	if all ya'll don't like systemd, don't use it
<tm512>	the list goes on and on
<[R]>	problem solved
<unicodesnowman>	[R], the issue we have is that systemd's monolithic design, and political decisions have made it difficult to avoid systemd.
<]>	tm512, even the Unix one init from 1969 was more than 100 lines of code
<tm512>	luckily only software that already sucks is starting to depend on systemd
<[R]>	unicodesnowman: yeah... you're just spouting crap now
<[R]>	if you dont want systemd, don't use it
<unicodesnowman>	[R], please tell me how I can use udev without systemd
<unicodesnowman>	please tell me how udev SHOULD require systemd
<[R]>	wasn't there a udev fork?
<unicodesnowman>	eudev, yeah
<[R]>	well there you go
<unicodesnowman>	but this is my point
<[R]>	if you dont liek the software thats available, you write your own
<tm512>	]: this is what I'm using for my system: http://git.2f30.org/sinit/tree/sinit.c
<[R]>	that is the point
<[R]>	thats been the point for 20 years
<tm512>	89 lines including blank lines
<unicodesnowman>	the systemd team & allies have intentionally 'spread' systemd via a system of interlocking dependencies
<[R]>	give me 1 example then
<[R]>	cuz you just said udev
<[R]>	which is bullshit
<unicodesnowman>	[R], logind
<[R]>	what the hell is logind
<unicodesnowman>	[R], man logind
<[R]>	lol
<[R]>	see, thats not how defending stupid things works
<]>	unicodesnowman, systemd-udevd requires systemd because it allows you to finely tune how udev works with services, and make other services depending on them, i.e. system/systemd-udevd.service ... I don't agree with it, but they had some reason
<unicodesnowman>	brb
<triceratux>	theres a lot of hardcore unix/bsd types in other parts of the world who have always been able to treat "linux" as almost identical in terms of services & logging. suddenly theres an enormous unaccountable mystery http://xaxatyxa.ru/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/pervichnaya-nastroyka-konfiguratsiya-freebsd10.jpg
<[R]>	]: i love how people love quoting blog posts
<[R]>	ZOMG SYSTEMD IS EVIL
<SpiceMan>	it is. computers are evil. SKYNET
<[R]>	i'm about to roll out my own embedded system... and shockingly
<annihilannic>	As I said to a colleague just now, systemd must be doing *something* right for it to be so widely adopted.
<[R]>	it's not gonna have systemd
<[R]>	WHAT?! SAY IT AIN'T SO
<tm512>	of course, rather than coming up with real arguments, like opponents of systemd can do, proponents just fall back to mockery
<[R]>	I THOUGHT YOU NEED SYSTEMD!?
<SpiceMan>	people that complain about systemd are the same that ask about distros to switch DEs
<tm512>	wide adoption has nothing to do with correctness or good design
*	SpiceMan flies away
<]>	tm512, I hope you realize that applies to sysvinit as well
<[R]>	for thousands of years
<[R]>	all we had was sysvinit
<tm512>	I'm not talking about sysvinit
<[R]>	and it didnd't bother people one bit
<[R]>	about how we had no choice and everyone had to use th e smae thing
<annihilannic>	[R]: do you like systemd or are you indifferent?  if you like it, what's good?  (I haven't used it yet)
<]>	I think if every second people invested into arguing systemd-vs-nosystemd was invested into writing init systems, we would be living in a whole different world
<[R]>	it starts my shit
<[R]>	i.e. it does its job
<annihilannic>	]: with 27,000,000 init systems
<[R]>	i guess i like it
<[R]>	although i dont think im using it on the current system im on
<]>	[R], which system
<[R]>	my laptop
<]>	thats not very specific
<ayecee>	]: a world with a lot more different init systems :)
<[R]>	not to mention the fact that 99% of the people that bitcch about systemd, it doesnt make any bit of a differnece to them... they jsut bitch to bitch
<[R]>	]: its black
<]>	[R], thats racist

<annihilannic>	it doesn't reflect a lot of light

*	SmashingX_ is now known as SmashingX
<ayecee>	]: yeah, that is also something i'd like to try
<SmashingX>	I want a directory to be fast to read from, like on tmpfs for some time. The closest thing is this: vmtouch -L -m 2G /path/to/mydir
<SmashingX>	But this does not detect new or deleted files.
<ayecee>	i had not heard of vmtouch before, but i imagine you could combine it with icron to handle new/deleted files.
<ayecee>	hmm. does vmtouch have to remain running? i guess maybe that wouldn't work then.
<SpiceMan>	mount -t tmpfs -o size=2g tmfps /path/to/mydir
<SpiceMan>	then you have tmpfs, not something "like" tmpfs
<ayecee>	SpiceMan: you'd still have to copy the files in from the underlying filesystem.
<ayecee>	heh. i'm imagining a bcache-like setup with one of the devices being a ramdisk.
<[R]>	you're a ramdisk
<ayecee>	your mom's a ramdisk
<[R]>	LOL
<]>	SmashingX, maybe you wand anything-sync-daemon, it uses an overlay between your data and a tmpfs
<]>	your data is in a tmpfs, and is efficiently synced back to the hdd (only whats changed)

*	metastableB_ is now known as metastableb
<]>	what about it

<SmashingX>	could you elaborate?

<reisio>	it's still the only microkernel OS so far that has any hope
<reisio>	and I'm counting minix
<intelikey>	anyway to make network-manager setup my wifi without starting X ?       when i boot it takes starting x to get wifi going...
<reisio>	symptom of a world with very few real OS problems
<reisio>	Plan 9 isn't really being adopted well either
<reisio>	despite being superior
<reisio>	turnkey app support will always be more important
<intelikey>	i did plan 9  for a little while.   back when it was new
<reisio>	back when its license made it even less realistic?
<intelikey>	hehhe yeah
<]>	reisio, turnkey?
<reisio>	turnkey
<intelikey>	so wifi    ?
<]>	intelikey, there's nm-cli or something like that, also netctl which works without X at all but apparently that's deprecated now?
<reisio>	still stinks of that license
<intelikey>	i would like  ascript
<]>	intelikey, if you have systemd use systemd-networkd.service
<]>	or I can give you my service
<]>	reisio, turnkey? i dont get it
<]>	bah
*	intelikey looks for systemd
<]>	intelikey, if you're on anything older than debian-jessie you won't have it
<intelikey>	then i should have it.
<intelikey>	jessie is current stable ?
<]>	yes
<intelikey>	k
<]>	systemctl enable systemd-networkd.service should enable it

<zaccanasta>	hi guys, i have an atheros wifi chip and an atheros bluetooth chip in my laptop (ath9k and ath3k)
<]>	zaccanasta, that's great.
<intelikey>	i'll go test.    thanks ]
*	[R] gives zaccanasta a gold star
<zaccanasta>	i managed having ath9k loaded 1st at boot
<]>	[R], you're going to run out fast at this point
<[R]>	]: lol
<zaccanasta>	otherwise bluetooth doesn't work
<[R]>	zaccanasta: is there a punchline?
<zaccanasta>	problem is when i put the laptop to sleep
*	[R] is on the edge of his seat
<zaccanasta>	after that bluetooth stop working
<]>	zaccanasta, rfkill list
<zaccanasta>	is there any workaround?
<zaccanasta>	it seems bluetooth firmware is unloaded when put to sleep
<]>	zaccanasta, did you try rfkill list?
<zaccanasta>	http://paste.fedoraproject.org/222811/19193241/
<]>	zaccanasta, what distro are you using?
<]>	if it has systemd, check if bluetooth.target is being used
<zaccanasta>	f21
<zaccanasta>	as i said bluetooth works until i put laptop to sleep
<]>	right, systemd should handle that
<]>	since it is responsible for putting your laptop to sleep
<]>	zaccanasta, also try lsmod | grep 'bluetooth\|btusb'
<dfzxh>	i just shit in my pants
<zaccanasta>	http://paste.fedoraproject.org/222812/14319195/
<]>	zaccanasta, well that's not good
<]>	zaccanasta, what happens if you sudo modprobe bluetooth
<zaccanasta>	bluetooth module is already loaded
<]>	hmm its written with a capital letter for you, try Bluetooth
<Evidlo>	Is there anywhere in ntp.conf to specify timezone?
<[R]>	Evidlo: ntp uses utc
<[R]>	Evidlo: you properly configure your dist for your timezone
<zaccanasta>	any idea?
<]>	zaccanasta, did you try probing Bluetooth instead of bluetooth?
<zaccanasta>	what do you mean by that? module name uppercase?
<sauvin>	dfzxh, sudo shutdown -h now # and shut the hell up

<jsc802>	anyone willing to answer a cpanel/dns question for a newbie?
<Dominian>	cpanel.. no.. dns sure
<Dominian>	:)
<[R]>	sure, as long as the answer is "stay as far away from it as possible"
<jsc802>	the question is : i have a cheap linux hosting account that doesnt allow me to create addon domains in addition to my primary hosted domain
<jsc802>	but what i would like to do is have an additional domain be an alias of the main domain
<jsc802>	do you by any chance know if that might be possible
<jsc802>	sorr for asking in the wrong place :D
<[R]>	well register a domain, get a dns server to host it, and the npoint the A record to your ip
<jsc802>	ok so its registered on godaddy and i can point the a record to the host ip
<jsc802>	what does dns server mean? does godaddy usually provide that, or the host?
<[R]>	if you can point to the ip on godaddy, then tahts it
<jsc802>	really? i thought that wouldnt work without configuring the host to accept the domain
<jsc802>	i will try
<[R]>	well of course you have to configure the web server to accept it
<jsc802>	yes so i guess its really a cpanel question
<jsc802>	because my host doesnt allow me to have 'addon domains'
<[R]>	well then you can't do it
<jsc802>	but it does allow me 'advanced dns zone editor'
<[R]>	you already have dns set up
<[R]>	you need th eweb server set up
<jsc802>	do you think i could add a new domain onto there (advanced dns zone editor)?
<jsc802>	i dont need it to point to its own folder/subdomain
<[R]>	dns has nothing to do with the web server
<jsc802>	hm
<jsc802>	i appreciate you trying to help but it hasnt clarified it for me
<jsc802>	i will do more research
<[R]>	if your host doestn let you
<[R]>	then they dont let you
<[R]>	nothign we can do
<jsc802>	they dont let me do addon domains
<jsc802>	trynig to figure out if i can still do alias domain
<[R]>	well call them
<jsc802>	hehe it is nosupportlinuxhosting

<annihilannic>	134 out of 256GB free, and we have 24GB in swap... and processes blocking on swap... why??
<ayecee>	something really big must have recently died.
<annihilannic>	ayecee: It's been like this for a while now
<ayecee>	annihilannic: when you say free, it's that it's not even being used as cache?
<annihilannic>	ayecee: exactly.. another 89GB in cached!
<annihilannic>	vm.swappiness=60... probably a little aggressive.. but shouldn't priorities swap over free memory surely
<Bray90820>	Can I set linux up as an afp server
<ayecee>	i think that once a page goes out to swap, it's recorded as used swap even if it's later returned to memory
<annihilannic>	'shouldn't it prioritise' that was supposed to say
<annihilannic>	ayecee: that's right, and it shows in the kbswapcad column in sar -r
<annihilannic>	ayecee: but we are seeing actual swapping in/out activity
<ayecee>	huh
<annihilannic>	ayecee: and processes blocking on i/o
<ayecee>	awhile is seconds, minutes, hours?
<ayecee>	Bray90820: probably yes
<Bray90820>	ayecee: I wanted to setup ubuntu as an afp server to use it with apples time machine
<annihilannic>	ayecee: at least hours, probably over the weekend
<annihilannic>	ayecee: unfortunately sar logging was disabled

<klys>	I'm having some trouble with alsa, /dev/snd/controlC0: no such device
<Evidlo>	Are there any methods of searching text files that are significantly faster than cat/grep?
<annihilannic>	Evidlo: grep -F, if you are searching for non-regex
<annihilannic>	Evidlo: grep is pretty much one of the most optimised pieces of code on the planet, you won't find anything much faster unless you restructure your search in another way
<rumpel>	Evidlo, cat doesn't search
<Evidlo>	I was using cat to pipe the data into grep
<Evidlo>	force of habit
<annihilannic>	Evidlo: that is a UUOC.
<socomm>	Evidlo: grep can take the target you'd like to search as the last parameter.
<Evidlo>	I know, seems a lot faster too
<rumpel>	Evidlo, well... grep doesn't use an index for search. That would increase speed drastically. With an index any search would be linear to the search term in best case.
<Evidlo>	Is grep really able to search 1.8G of text in 3 seconds?
<Evidlo>	Or am I doing something wrong
<socomm>	Evidlo: Depends.
<socomm>	How fast is your processor, how fast is your storage?
<annihilannic>	Evidlo: If you've done it more than once... it's probably cached, in which case, it might.
<Evidlo>	Just a laptop
<ayecee>	what was the pattern?
<rumpel>	Evidlo, grep doesn't check each and every byte. it's smarter than that so it can run quite fast.
<Evidlo>	Widloski,  I'm searching a csv of doctors
<student_15195>	Evidlo: Do you know which column your information should be in?
<andrew39>	ya im pretty impressed at greps speed
<Evidlo>	student_15195: Yes, but it's plenty fast already.  I was just curious why
*	Blashyrk1 is now known as Jesterboxboy
<student_15195>	Evidlo: because instead of using the cat command to feed to grep, you can use the "cut" command
<student_15195>	Evidlo: for instance, if you're looking for "john" in the 3rd column in a tab delimited file called "test.csv" you can type 'cut -f 3 test.csv'
<student_15195>	Evidlo: if you have a comma separated file you can type ' cut -d ',' -f 3 test.csv >> grep "john"
<student_15195>	Evidlo: that would only feed the specific column you need instead of grepping through the whole file
<annihilannic>	student_15195: besides, I'm sure he's interested in the entire content of the line rather than just the contents of the field?
<rumpel>	student_15195, a comparison would be interesting. I could imagine that with the right regex grep alone is probably faster.
<ayecee>	student_15195: i'd think that'd be slower. you have a one program looking for line starts, fields and line ends, and another looking for the text, instead of one program just looking for the text.
<student_15195>	Perhaps, I can't say i've tested this for speed
<Evidlo>	Ahh balls.  the strings have commas in them
<student_15195>	Oh bob saget!
<rumpel>	Evidlo, no problem

<gammy>	Excuse my ignorance if this is the wrong place for such a question.
<aindriu>	can someone give me the name of a linux distro that has the latest kernel please?
<ayecee>	aindriu: why?
<ayecee>	aindriu: that is, why do you want the distro to have the latest kernel?
<SpiceMan>	all distros have git(?)

<aindriu>	ok thanks
<gammy>	aindriu, archlinux perhaps is pretty bleeding edge
<sauvin>	It's also not for n00bs.
*	gammy shrugs
<aindriu>	what about a linux distro with the 4 kernel?
<ayecee>	aindriu: do you think you need that particular version?
<aindriu>	i would like to try it
<ayecee>	you can install any version of the linux kernel you want once you have linux installed.
<xreal>	Can I unlink files, but keep the inodes?
*	Thyssen_ is now known as Thyssen
<ayecee>	xreal: how do you mean?
<SpiceMan>	yes, just have more linked files than the amount you want to unlink :P
<Whiskey>	what you can do is to remove the 0
<Whiskey>	lol the . and everything after it
<xreal>	ayecee: I want to keep the file on the disc, but just remove the "link" from fs to the inode.
<xreal>	SpiceMan: yeah, anywhere in a hidden directory?
<ayecee>	xreal: that would be the normal case, i'd think.
<ayecee>	xreal: the file normally remains on disk after deletion.
<xreal>	ayecee: until when?
<SpiceMan>	until overwritten \o/
<xreal>	ayecee: on SSDs, they'll be wiped pretty soon?
<xreal>	SpiceMan: yeah, but this *could* happen in seconds?
<ayecee>	if you use discard or fstrim, yes
<SpiceMan>	rm file. ctrl-alt-POWERBUTTON. and pray that it didn't get overwritten.
<SpiceMan>	and you can't boot into your OS again, or you're sOL
<ayecee>	xreal: this is an unusual idea. what's it for?
<xreal>	ayecee: I'm currently playing with hardlinks and just got this idea :)
<xreal>	ayecee: Hehe: Poor man's file hiding.
<SpiceMan>	xreal: just encrypt it and rename the file: "YOU CAN SEE BUT YOU CAN'T TOUCH.porn.avi"
<ayecee>	xreal: as long as a process has the file open, it won't be removed even if it's deleted.
<xreal>	SpiceMan: nah, then a new file will get created.
<SpiceMan>	?
<xreal>	ayecee: so you can't "mark" inodes to be saved?
<xreal>	SpiceMan: I just want to play with inodes, not to hide files. This was just an idea for ayecee
<ayecee>	xreal: not in a way that would survive a fsck
<xreal>	ayecee: wait, you can delete open files in linux? :D
<ayecee>	yup. open files can be deleted.
<annihilannic>	xreal: removing files is implemented by unlinking them, which by definition means they are free to be reused
<xreal>	ayecee: sounds evil.
<xreal>	annihilannic: ack
<annihilannic>	xreal: it can be.  some programmes pre-emptively remove their own temporary files so that they will be automatically released when the programme ends.
<jelly>	xreal: it solves some problems and introduces others
<ayecee>	xreal: nope, it's quite common.
<ayecee>	annihilannic: that must be a pain to troubleshoot
<xreal>	it would be nice to get asked: "this file is opened by pid nnnnn, do you really want to delete it"?
<SpiceMan>	it would be hell
<annihilannic>	ayecee: yep, especially if you don't have an lsof handy that can show you (deleted) files... on HP-UX for example.
<ayecee>	heh
<xreal>	I even have lsof compiled for my iPhone :)
<xreal>	Thanks to all for your information. I've understood it much better now.
<annihilannic>	the worst thing about being able to delete open files though is when a DBA comes along and removes gigabytes of trace files thinking he's freeing up tons of space, only to find that none gets released.
<ayecee>	same with system log files in general
<annihilannic>	and then of course you have no file handle that you can flatten any more, so the only option is to restart the processes involved, which are invariably some mission-critical production databases...
<annihilannic>	so you end up throwing tons of pointless gigabytes at a filesystem until such time as a restart can be organised...
<ayecee>	it wouldn't be memorable if they weren't

<xreal>	Nice, "VMware Player Free" is allowed to be used in University for education, but not in infrastructure. VirtualBox is allowed to be used in both environments.
<limbo>	xreal: even if you delete a open file the application holding it open can still use it. and you can easily restore the file from /proc as well
<annihilannic>	I like VirtualBox.  I just hate the way it has an Oracle logo on it now instead of a Sun one.  *sigh*
<ayecee>	limbo: not anymore
<ayecee>	limbo: they fixed that
<SpiceMan>	annihilannic: it just sounded oracle-ish :P
<limbo>	ayecee: when?
<ayecee>	limbo: i was surprised too. late 2.6, i think.
<xreal>	limbo: thanks for this idea.
<limbo>	ayecee: pretty sure I've used it since
<limbo>	ayecee: oh, that machine is actually running 2.6 :D
<ayecee>	limbo: let me find the info i was referring to
<annihilannic>	limbo: how would you restore the file?  by hard linking it from the fd to its original filesytem?
<SpiceMan>	annihilannic: also "mission critical"
<ayecee>	limbo: the ln -L thing in proc, right?
<tm512>	I am getting "init Not tainted" while trying to boot this kernel with a custom initramfs
<limbo>	ayecee: just cp it
<tm512>	everything I have seen so far tells me this is related to SELinux, which I have disabled
<limbo>	from the correct file descriptor
<ayecee>	limbo: oh, that way. yeah, that still works.
<ayecee>	limbo: just can't relink it.
<limbo>	ayecee: http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=aae8a97d3ec30788790d1720b71d76fd8eb44b73
<annihilannic>	limbo: can you flatten it using that fd?
<annihilannic>	(trying to find an example I can test with)
<ayecee>	limbo: that's the one!
<limbo>	ayecee: http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=104973707408577
<limbo>	annihilannic: before 2.6.39 it seems you could ln -L /proc/pid/fd/number /path/to/file
<limbo>	annihilannic: but they removed that functionality for security reasons as stated in the links I just posted to ayecee :)
<limbo>	annihilannic: you can still read the file contents from the fd, and restore a copy of the file
<annihilannic>	limbo: bummer.
<annihilannic>	limbo: yeah, I'm usually more interested in destroying the data than restoring it ;-)
<xreal>	What did I do? Sorry for the discussion I've started :D
<limbo>	ayecee: if that commit is all that is blocking this, wouldnt it be pretty trivial to revert that using some kernel module or such?
<limbo>	xreal: dunno! what do you want to do? :)
<ayecee>	limbo: certainly
<xreal>	limbo: I just asked a small question.
<limbo>	ayecee: however, if you can insert kernel modules, you can read the fd as well :)
<ayecee>	limbo: well, except that some notes i've seen related to this patch says that several filesystems were doing it already internally.
<ayecee>	not sure if they took that out when they added this in
<annihilannic>	anyone know of a tricky pgrep/pkill shortcut to list processes running against *this* terminal?
<cultavix>	is there a way to forward the output of a process into a log file with a timestamp? i.e. /bin/someprogram >> logfile.log (I'd like the date inside of the file, not in the file name)
<annihilannic>	or do I have to use $(tty) and chop off the /dev/...
<annihilannic>	cultavix: I wrote a perl script to do that...
<cultavix>	maybe it's /bin/someprogram | sed -e "s/^/$(date -R) /" >> lofile.log
<annihilannic>	cultavix: Not aware of a standard utility that does it...
<cultavix>	oh right?
<cultavix>	would sed work maybe ?
<annihilannic>	cultavix: no, because the date would only be evalutated once
<annihilannic>	cultavix: I'll pastebin my script somewhere
<cultavix>	thanks
<SpiceMan>	backdoor installation: 19% done
<annihilannic>	cultavix: http://paste.linuxassist.net/view/91543057
<annihilannic>	cultavix: hopefully the code is simple enough that you can see no backdoors in it ;-)
<cultavix>	:)
<cultavix>	Thank you very much, I'll mess around with it...
<limbo>	cultavix: maybe look at using syslog :)
<bosnjak>	hi all
<bosnjak>	I have a scanner connected via USB, and I can see it with sane-find-scanner (the vendor and product id are there). I added those to the backend config, but I still don't see the scanner in the scan application. Do I need to reload Sane or something?
<thaw>	hi guys
<cultavix>	limbo, not a bad idea....
<cultavix>	limbo, I've written a tool in bash which checks remote directories for certain file types and then moves them around to diff. servers
<thaw>	hi guys
<thaw>	I have some questions about perf and hardware counters, maybe its not the best channel (if you have a better one, please let me know)
<thaw>	like my first basic question is: I have a CPU and an old linux kernel (2.6.32), perf returns me "unsupported event" for an event (lets say L1D cache load miss)
<thaw>	how can I know if upgrading the kernel will help, or if the hardwareevent is simply not here on that CPU
<ayecee>	by upgrading the kernel
<thaw>	yeah its not my home desk though
<thaw>	its in production at work :) I would like to know that before asking a guy to upgrade the kernel
<thaw>	I was looking for that on intel website but I cant find an exhaustive list of hard events per CPU model
<colo-work>	ask someone with the same CPU generation and a newer kernel in service :)
<thaw>	yeah ... but again, it seems crazy that I cant find that on intel website
<kn1ght>	can you not temporarily boot into a newer kernel and check?
<ayecee>	it's difficult to do that with servers that are used for business.
<sasha>	Just wondering, is there a way to disable sleep on brother printers from linux directly?
<sasha>	Only solution I found was using a windows utility - https://locatingus.zendesk.com/entries/23865498-How-to-Disable-Sleep-Mode-in-your-Brother-QL-Printer
<sasha>	but it looks like a single use utility that sends something over usb or something
<XXCoder1>	wonder if wine can run that
<Shibe>	is manjaro a good beginner distro?
<ayecee>	Shibe: yes
<XXCoder1>	I didnt keep up with wine dev so not sure where it is at now
<Shibe>	ok
<vadmeste>	Hello everybody. Do people really need --disable-color in a given command line tool?
<ikonia>	up to you
<ikonia>	remove it if you don't want it
<limbo>	vadmeste: no thats racist!
<ikonia>	limbo: please don't be silly
<ikonia>	it is nothign to do with race, that sort of silly joke is not welcome
<annihilannic>	ikonia: do you speak for all of us?
*	Ian is now known as Guest8528
<limbo>	vadmeste: I'd prefer having "--enable-color", and not have colorized output be default.
<ikonia>	annihilannic: yes
<thegladiator>	yeah same here limbo
<thegladiator>	everything fancy should be seperated from the tool itself
<vadmeste>	well, I guess colors weren't supported in every terminal that's why there is an option to disable colors.. I don't think it is a taste option :D
<ikonia>	not all terminals do
<ikonia>	I'd assume it's a safety thing as opposed to a design choice
<sasha>	XXCoder2: couldn't get it to run in a vm but it worked fine on my mac - now I have to see if this actually wrote it to the printer or if it's a local settings file on the computer
<XXCoder2>	lets see what happens
<benoliver999>	If I tell cron to run every five minutes, does it run at 10,15,20,25 minutes past etc...? My crontab has this */5 * * * *
<benoliver999>	Or does it just run from when I start the service?
<peetaur2>	ikonia: vadmeste: I would think a terminal that doesn't suport things is supposed to set the TERM variable differently
<go|dfish>	benoliver999: 10,15,20,25,etc
<sasha>	XXCoder2: (we'll have to wait an hour to see if it worked :p)
<benoliver999>	go|dfish: Thanks
<XXCoder2>	fun
<sasha>	but then I have to set up the udev rules and remove the loop that runs a sudo chmod on the printer every 2 secodns
<ikonia>	peetaur2: thats another good way
<hay207>	hi guys, how to toggle desktop on/off from command line using wmctrl?
<gammy>	hay207, Could you be more explicit?
<hay207>	ok, what is the command behind "show desktop" icon?
<kraftb>	Hi
<ikonia>	hay207: I don't think there is a command
<gammy>	I don't think there is such an X11 command
<ikonia>	it's an api call
<gammy>	"command" ..
<ikonia>	as part of the desktop
<gammy>	X11 isn't really aware of a desktop, is it?
<gammy>	You could probably obtain a list of any raised standard windows and iconify each one
<xreal>	Does anyone know "cowdancer" and "cow-shell"? unbelieveable nice tools.
<gammy>	Ie, using the 'hidden' property as in -b add,hidden
<hay207>	ok
*	g105b_ is now known as g105b
<gammy>	hay207, actually, it seems wmctrl has an option for it!
<gammy>	hay207, wmctrl -k on/off
<hay207>	won't work
<hay207>	"/"
*	KayAteChef is now known as Guest77264
<gammy>	hay207, it can be either 'on' or 'off'
<hay207>	i want from edge binding to toggle it
<gammy>	uhhuh, so?
<sasha>	hmm that doesn't work on raspbian
<hay207>	on and off , i want them on a single command
<hay207>	not on or off
<gammy>	Well, there doesn't seem to be one, so you might have to implement it yourself.
<gammy>	Keep track of the current state.
<hay207>	ok thanks
<gammy>	You could do it by wrapping the wmctrl call in a small shellscript which stores the current state in a file.
<hay207>	sorry for bothering you
<gammy>	Or even just creating/removing a file to define the state
<gammy>	hay207, something like this.. if [ -e ~/.hidden_desktop ]; then echo "desktop is hidden, showing"; wmctrl -k off && rm ~/.hidden_desktop; else echo "Desktop is visible, hiding"; wmctrl -k on && touch ~/.hidden_desktop; fi
*	ChanServ gives channel operator status to eir
<gammy>	if your wm doesn't support the show/hide desktop command, you could scan for window ID's and do the same thing with the "hidden" property
*	eir removes ban on *!*marek@magura.sinet.sk$##fix_your_connection
*	eir removes channel operator status from eir
<hay207>	wmctrl -k on | wmctrl -k  off ,this somehow works , i am a beginner in programming
<gammy>	hay207, in that case you'd replace the "wmctrl -k" command with something like .. for id in $(wmctrl -l | cut -d " " -f 1); do wmctrl -i -r $id -r -b add,hidden; done
<gammy>	hay207, then I think the first one-liner I gave you should work.
<gammy>	hay207, hrm or if your magical OR-toggle works, use that! :)
<gammy>	If it works, I guess wmctrl will return an error code if the state was unchanged, and then your OR will work. Pretty nifty if so!

<sauvin>	Thyssen, that sounds like a question for the ##macosx guys.
<LMNOP>	It sure does.
*	peetaur2 agrees
<Thyssen>	Oh, didn’t know there was an OSX channel;) sry
<gammy>	I think it is possible though.
<gammy>	But I'm not sure if Apples EFI will do it out of the box. REFInd might add such functionality..

<Voyage>	 Is there an easy way to just sign a PDF?
<peetaur2>	Voyage: gpg --sign  :)
<joakimk_>	We're trying to deploy a Java application (EAR/WAR file) to a Linux server running Jetty. Just uploading the archive (application) to webapps/ seems to get it up and running, but we're stuck setting up the JDBC connections etc
<Voyage>	peetaur2,   what will it do? cant I also put a snap of sign and/or edit the pdf and put my name
<peetaur2>	Voyage: gpg makes a cryptographic signature using your private key that can be validated using your public key
<joakimk_>	Thing is, we had this running on a windows 2003 server, with Oracle Application Server 10g. But, since win03 is going down, we're trying to migrate the app to a new server... without having to change/rewrite the webapplication
<Voyage>	peetaur2,  how can I edit pdf and insert my image / text also?
<kraftb>	Voyage: Try open office draw or inkscape
<joakimk_>	The IT dept. assigned us a Linux server with Jetty
<Voyage>	kraftb,  I have libre office. but I guess openoffice and libre can edit a PDF.. no?
<kraftb>	I guess you could use pdftk if you want to do it on the commandline
<peetaur2>	Voyage: programming languages have libraries for things like that
<kraftb>	of course they can
<kraftb>	but I prefer inkscape
<kraftb>	recently I clicked on a pdf and it opened (editable) in oo draw
<Voyage>	peetaur2,  ya but how can I edit a PDF
<peetaur2>	joakimk_: did you find some jdbc stuff in jetty? Jetty is very minimal, so I would assume it has none, so you just set it up yourself, eg. using a connection pool library that you drop in the lib directory or put in your ear/war file.
<peetaur2>	Voyage: using such a library... for example https://pdfbox.apache.org/
<cyberpolice>	can i ctrl-c a "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" command while it is in Get: 65% and not in installing mode yet. it is stuck and not moving
<cyberpolice>	either that or its moving very very slowly
<cyberpolice>	hello?
<autrilla>	hello
<kraftb>	cyberpolice: Yes it should not cause a problem
<peetaur2>	cyberpolice: you can ctrl+c at any step, but if bugs happen and it doesn't revert the install steps then it could break things. At the download steps, it's likely very safe
<cyberpolice>	alright :)
<cyberpolice>	i think the server is under load or something. after i redid the command it is stuck oin 0% waiting for headers
<cyberpolice>	oh well
*	XXCoder2 is now known as XXCoder
<xreal>	Is BTRFS okay for a normal Linux system or shall I keep ext4 ?
<johskar>	works fine for me
<autrilla>	same here
*	GPenguin looks at bug tracker
<xreal>	I never needed LVM or snapshots... that's why I'm curious.
*	kopfkind is now known as kopfkind_
<johskar>	the feature I use most on it is actualy compression
<johskar>	oh and the fact I can give one subvolume for home and another for root, they share the space and if I have to reinstall I only have to whipe the root subvol
<xreal>	Currently, I'm running a RAID-5 with MDADM and ext4. Can I drop this when using BTRFS?
<johskar>	snapshots are great when I want to say... try a new DE or something else that might break stuff, takes seconds to go back to the way it was before I started breaking it
<peetaur2>	xreal: btrfs raid5 might not be perfectly stable; better ask in #btrfs
<xreal>	peetaur2: ok
<johskar>	xreal: https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Using_Btrfs_with_Multiple_Devices
<xreal>	johskar: yeah, just found that <3
<johskar>	raid 5/6 support is quite fresh in btrfs iirc. you could just slap btrfs on the existing mdadm RAID-5 too tho, (but loose some of the benefits of btrfs being directly on the drives/partitions ofc.
<johskar>	most of my raid is in hardware or zfs so can't reccomend anything around that tho
<peetaur2>	johskar: do you have any really large zfs, like 70 TB? I have lots on FreeBSD which run fine and one on linux which is horribly slow (takes like 3 weeks to scrub :D)
<johskar>	my zfs is on OmniOS boxes (and some VMs), quite fast to scrub, but they are one volume with several RAIDZ2 stripes, largest is prox 50TB iirc.
<cldbeadctv>	whats tha fascination with zfs
<peetaur2>	zfs is the old btrfs ;)
<peetaur2>	and works fine on solaris and bsd I think
<johskar>	oh wait, I got one linux zfs box, 12TB in a single RAIDZ5 over 6 drives, takes ... a while to scrub, but not weeks, 6-8 hours iirc.
<DexterLB>	I need to run a loop (in a shell script) every 0.25 seconds, without accumulating error. Is there a command that outputs something every x seconds, and acts like watch -p?
<cldbeadctv>	anybody would think linux is useless without zfs the way you guys go on about it
<peetaur2>	not useless, just missing some nice stuff
<peetaur2>	zfs is just storage... I would never use FreeBSD for anything else
<peetaur2>	linux is the general purpose greatest thing, but the zfs isn't as good (but likely will never see a problem on a smaller machine)
<GPenguin>	what is google's filesystem called again?
<xreal>	peetaur2 & johskar: RAID is *very* experimental as it seems. Wouldn't it be a better solution to install btrfs on mdadm RAID or will this make trouble?
<xreal>	"btrfs does not yet seem to know that if you removed a drive from an array and you plug it back in later, that drive is out of date. "
<xreal>	wtf :)
<peetaur2>	I think the raid1 and 10 are farily fine... they were fine years ago
<peetaur2>	just the raid 5/6 is not done yet
<xreal>	peetaur2: RAID0, RAID1 and RAID10 are the simplest modes... so no problem :)
<johskar>	xreal: seeing my netgear nas uses btrfs on lvm (and some software raid tango) I suspect running it on md raid should work too
<GPenguin>	ah, Colossus
<cldbeadctv>	lol
<peetaur2>	running it on md raid will solve the raid issues, but will sacrifice the checksum and healing ability
<xreal>	johskar: suspect or expect?
<johskar>	xreal: suspect, I never expect anything in combos I haven't tried my self hands on :-)
<xreal>	johskar: hehe
<GPenguin>	i would like to have a filesystem where you can read and write while the box is off
<johskar>	peetaur2: the linux zfs volume takes 7h21m on average
<johskar>	peetaur2: and it was a 5-drive, not 6-drive raidz1
<_user>	hello
<_user>	guys
<_user>	where can i find x11 conf ?
<johskar>	GPenguin: like you can with windows vms under hyper-v? install/remove software even when the vm is offline?
<GPenguin>	where the other config files are
<_user>	tell me
<_user>	dir
<Terr>	probably /etc/X11
<_user>	hmmm
<_user>	there i dont have
<_user>	;/
<GPenguin>	create one :)
<johskar>	_user: normaly /etc/X11 (or /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d (if not then X tries to autodetect all parts when starting)
<_user>	what should i do
<mickkelodeon>	Hi, I have 100 processes running in my server, answering to real time petitions, but as the number of processes have been increasing, the time to process each petitions has increased to. Now, I'm thinking about changing the kernel to other one more useful for real time
<_user>	how to swich between
<_user>	tty's ?
<mickkelodeon>	is that a good idea?
<_user>	how
<safinaskar>	how to convert this text "north pole. found by pooh" to this "North pole. Found by pooh"?
<safinaskar>	i. e. how to make capital letters?
<_user>	?
<GPenguin>	you do something like Xorg -configure
<safinaskar>	give some script. bash/sh preferable, but sed/perl/etc will go, too
<safinaskar>	okey, i already found this: http://www.textfixer.com/tools/capitalize-sentences.php
<safinaskar>	thanks
<johskar>	GPenguin: more and more distros today use modular config for X and thus only need the things you want to customize or have to spesify manualy to work in files in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d (unless you use wayland or something and that's a whole different adventure)
<_user>	okay
<_user>	i have this
<johskar>	err... i ment _user
<_user>	what should i write there
<_user>	i have fluxbox
<_user>	what should i paste there
<_user>	?
<_user>	??
<johskar>	_user what distro are you on
<_user>	ARCH
<_user>	i need to start   my graphics
<_user>	cuz i swich  my graphics card
<GPenguin>	the modular config files were introduced by arse baskets
<johskar>	_user: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xorg
<GPenguin>	instead of 1 file (which is difficult enough) you have to manage lots of files now
<johskar>	_user: if you changed from say... amd to nvidia (or vice versa) you need to remove (or blacklist) the drivers for the card you removed and install the drivers for the new card
<_user>	ehhh
<johskar>	GPenguin: true that, but in some cases modular config is great
<_user>	i need only simple fluxbosz
<_user>	fluxbox
<_user>	what should i write to xorg conf
<_user>	?
<GPenguin>	_user: if you use arch linux the arch wiki is really a great source of helpful information
<hmmwhatsthisdo>	What's the easiest way to batch-rename files according to a pattern in a directory recursively? I had to move some wireless capture data to a FAT usb drive and all of the colons in the folder/filenames were changed to underscores
<barneygale>	I use the arch wiki all the time despite not running arch
<_user>	okay i get  it
<hmmwhatsthisdo>	now that I've moved them back to an ext4 drive, I'd like to change the underscores back to colons
<_user>	i get drivers
<_user>	now
<peetaur2>	hmmwhatsthisdo: if you can figure out the cryptic syntax, the "rename" command does that... otherwise make a script maybe using commands like: find, basename, sed
<_user>	where can i change
<_user>	drivers
<_user>	in conf
<hmmwhatsthisdo>	peetaur2: what would you suggest for swapping out multiple (5) underscores in a filename for colons?
<hmmwhatsthisdo>	insofar as the rename expression
<_user>	fucjk
<_user>	omg
<_user>	omg
<_user>	fuck i dont have time
<_user>	for fucking sake
<_user>	FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
<peetaur2>	_user: calm down before some ops give you what you rightfully deserve
<annihilannic>	hmmwhatsthisdo: rename s/:/_/g filenames ....
<peetaur2>	hmmwhatsthisdo: test on some sample files first :)
<hmmwhatsthisdo>	annihilannic: will that work for more than one underscore in a filename?
<annihilannic>	hmmwhatsthisdo: although depends on which version of rename you have, some use perl expressions like that, some use simple search and replace
*	ChanServ gives channel operator status to WildPikachu
*	WildPikachu sets ban on $a:_user
*	WildPikachu has kicked _user from ##linux (_user)
*	WildPikachu removes channel operator status from WildPikachu
<annihilannic>	hmmwhatsthisdo: yes, the /g means replace globally.  type 'rename --help' to clarify the syntax expected.
<annihilannic>	hmmwhatsthisdo: I'd try with the '-n' option first which just says what it *would* do without actually doing it.
<annihilannic>	hmmwhatsthisdo: seems like the 'rename' on this Ubuntu system is a link to 'prename' which is part of the perl package - explains the perl regex it uses.  what's yours?
<peetaur2>	oh that's why others said that there is no -n for dry run... the regular one doesn't seem to have that
<annihilannic>	yeah, one of the disadvantages of linux... the tool landscape keeps changing under your feet.
<peetaur2>	not all change is bad though
<annihilannic>	peetaur2: I agree... but I think this one should have stuck with its 'prename' identity
<peetaur2>	yeah probably... since they don't try to implement the same syntax apparently
<Voyage>	peetaur2,  kraftb  $ gpg --sign Signed-Ade\ Shokoya_Reciprocal-CQ_Technologies.pdf    gpg: no default secret key: secret key not available  gpg: signing failed: secret key not available
*	hmmwhatsthisdo tries updating KL once again
<peetaur2>	Voyage: you have to generate a key, and set it as ultimate trust, and then select it as the default, or when you sign you specify the key to sign with
<peetaur2>	Voyage: for one shot things like generating and trust, it's easier to use a gui
<Voyage>	peetaur2,   isnt there an easy way. gui way?
<peetaur2>	yes...just look for one. there are possibly lots (only linux one I know is gpa and forget if I used it)
<peetaur2>	but maybe simplty "gpg --gen-key" is all you need
<peetaur2>	(i forget if that sets it to ultimate already, or if that's only for when you import keys)
<julius__>	hi
<Voyage>	peetaur2,  hm
<Voyage>	peetaur2,  ok. whats after pgp --gen-key?
<julius__>	when i create filter rules in "icedove/thunderbird" are those uploaded to the server and distributed to my other clients or are they just local?
<peetaur2>	just hit enter and I think it is interactive
<peetaur2>	julius__: sadly no... it's local and annoying that way; I don't know why it shouldn't be obvious that a thing like IMAP needs that as part of the standard
<Voyage>	peetaur2,  ok. I did it and then I gpg --sign my.pdf     Now How do I know that its signed?
<peetaur2>	Voyage: the signature will most likely be a separate .asc file
<Voyage>	no
<Voyage>	there is no .asc
<peetaur2>	the convention is something like ".asc" is either a signature or encrypted thing that is "enarmored" in asci only, and .sig is a signature in binary instead, and .gpg is encrypted and in binary. (but nobody seems to recognize or care about the standard)

<Voyage>	I only see the.pdf
<Voyage>	2048-bit RSA key, ID 9C882D0C, created 2015-05-18
<Voyage>	but How do I verify
<Voyage>	gpg --verify Signed-Ade\ Shokoya_Reciprocal-CQ_Technologies.pdf
<Voyage>	gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found. gpg: the signature could not be verified.Please remember that the signature file (.sig or .asc)should be the first file given on the command line.
<peetaur2>	Voyage: okay to make a detached signature, you also need to add   --detach-sign
<peetaur2>	Voyage: by default it made a .gpg file which had the original file plus signature
<Voyage>	peetaur2,  right but why didnt it worked the first time.
<welpo>	I'm a user on a server without sudo/root access. Their MOTD is a bit annoying (huge ascii art of the company) and I'd like to hide/remove it. I've learnt about touch ~/.hushlogin and it almost does what I want, the problem is I want to keep 1) The OS info it displays above the MOTD, 2) The "You have mail" line as well as 3) Last login: Date & IP. Any ideas?
<peetaur2>	Voyage: it likely made a .gpg file instead of a .sig
<Voyage>	no new fiel was created with gpg --sign
<peetaur2>	welpo: grep -E "date thingy" /etc/motd or similar maybe
<BuildTheRobots>	sed/regex question: I thought "#?" would match 0 or 1 # symbols, but when I try and use this with sed it doesn't actually match (trying to match "#UseDNS xxx" or "UseDNS xxx" in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file

<Voyage>	wait
<Voyage>	I see one
<welpo>	peetaur2: Yeah, I found the MOTD on /etc/motd but it only has the ascii art, not the other lines I want to keep (that .hushlogin removes as well)
<Voyage>	peetaur2,  I see the .gpg file. so what do I send to the other party? the pdf or the.gpg?
*	metastableB_ is now known as metastableb
<peetaur2>	Voyage: you need both files to verify the signature
<peetaur2>	Voyage: but they also need your public key
<Voyage>	where is my public key?
<Voyage>	what files do I need to send them?
<peetaur2>	and to be sure about a signature, they have to recognize that the public key is really from you... like read them the fingerprint, or deliver it to them separately to be extra sure
<peetaur2>	Voyage: gpg -a --export youremail@wherever.com > yourpubkey.asc
<Voyage>	ok. where is my key file?
<Voyage>	k
<peetaur2>	you can also use --keyserver and --send-keys and then they can use --recv-keys to download them
<Voyage>	ok.
<Voyage>	I need to send publick key, the pdf, and what else?
<peetaur2>	and your private key is in ~/.gnupg/ somewhere... keep it safe
<Voyage>	ok
<peetaur2>	the pubkey, signature, and the file that you signed (the pdf)
<peetaur2>	to verify is to verify that a specific public key is the one that generated the signature from a specific file; so they know not just that there is a signature, but what was actually signed by you. So this way they know the file is not tampered with.
<peetaur2>	you only have to give them your key once; another signature another day can use the same key
<Voyage>	ok. so I have to give them 2 files. the publick key and the pdf. thats it?
<lng>	Hi! How can I figure out OpenSSL lib home path?
<peetaur2>	btw, this tool is what linux package managers use to verify that the packages you download are really from your distro's package maintainers... which is one major reason why linux is so resistent to malware :)
<Voyage>	peetaur2,  ok
<Voyage>	peetaur2,  so I have to give them 2 files. the publick key and the pdf. thats it?
<peetaur2>	Voyage: and the signature...   3 files first time, 2 files later (sig and file that you signed)
<Voyage>	signature? what wile .ext is that?
<peetaur2>	but generally this is used when the pdf+sig are sent to them in an untrusted way... like in an email that could be tampered with; and then the key is sent securely so they don't have to worry that the other files were sent insecurely
<peetaur2>	signature was .sig
<Voyage>	peetaur2,  what about .asc?
<peetaur2>	the asc is your pubkey from this command:    gpg -a --export youremail@wherever.com > yourpubkey.asc
<peetaur2>	but asc could be any gpg stuff that is "enarmored" (with -a)
<peetaur2>	so depends on what you ran
<Voyage>	ok
<peetaur2>	maybe to make it clearer, name the file with your email or something
<peetaur2>	or look up the proper conventions if they exist ;)
<Voyage>	$ gpg -verify Signed-Ade\ Shokoya_Reciprocal-CQ_Technologies.pdf.sig Signed-Ade\ Shokoya_Reciprocal-CQ_Technologies.pdf
<Voyage>	usage: gpg [options] --encrypt [filename]
<peetaur2>	use 2 - in the --verify
<Voyage>	hm
<peetaur2>	the GNU standard is that -abcd is like -a -b -c -d, and --abcd is just one option
<Voyage>	thanks!
<peetaur2>	and if the .sig file has the rest of the name in it already with .sig appended, the signed filename is optional
<Voyage>	thanks!
<Voyage>	great help
<Voyage>	peetaur2,  verify by .sig was file but
<Voyage>	$ gpg --verify pubkey.asc  Signed-Ade\ Shokoya_Reciprocal-CQ_Technologies.pdf
<Voyage>	gpg: verify signatures failed: unexpected data
<peetaur2>	you can't verify a pubkey like that... unless you signed it too :)
<peetaur2>	with another key ...
<Voyage>	oh :)
<peetaur2>	you are the only authority on whether or not your key is correct. The standard way to verify is to get the fingerprint (gpg --fingerprint youremail@wherever.com) and get that to them securely, and they can then import and check the fingerprint the same way.
<Voyage>	thanks

<peetaur2>	maybe you should make a 2nd linxu account on your box and try to import the key and verify so you can provide detailed instructions
<Trefex>	hello. on centos, which is the best io monitor and network monitor that you guys use? I found iotop and iptraf-ng, but wondering if something nicer is around
<BluesKaj>	Hiyas all
<hackergirl>	Best distro for network monitoring is kali linux by offensive security hands down
<Trefex>	hackergirl: oh i meant on the same host, eg not to monitor network as such, but eth0 etc
<hackergirl>	Best tool is wireshark
<hackergirl>	And scapy for analysis
<Trefex>	hackergirl: however, on that note, would it be advisable to use Kali to test security of VMs hosting critical data?
<Trefex>	senseitive*
<hackergirl>	I literally with wireshark was able to see some idiot from china trying to brute force my server ssh
<peetaur2>	some idiot? not 50 new idiots every day?
<Trefex>	lol i use fail2ban for that
<Trefex>	wouldn't that be enough ?
<aib>	is there a more compressed form of "command; if [ $? eq 128 ];" in zsh/bash/sh ? something like $(command} but returning exit code?
<hackergirl>	Kali is great for vm environments for security testing I have  7 different operating systems and servers I test on my single kali install running bare metal it works fantastic
<Trefex>	ah nice i will have a look into that
<hackergirl>	Virtual box is what I use its free and great
<px42>	Hi
<px42>	There is one VPN connection between router and another device.Now I want to monitor the health of this VPN connection
<hackergirl>	You will want to used the bridged adapter mode so each vm gets assigned an ip from your routers dhcp server
<px42>	Is there any way we can monitor the traffic and load of this VPN connection
<px42>	and another thing this vpn authorises only 1 IP
<px42>	so i can not get IP for another device from same VPN
<BluesKaj>	nothing like an attention grabbing nick to make things interesting
<hackergirl>	nethogs is a neat bandwidth tool if u are doing vpn sys wide
<px42>	hackergirl: what about only a single connection
<annihilannic>	aib: more detail please?
<annihilannic>	Trefex: Perhaps something like munin for your host monitoring needs?
<Trefex>	i used nethogs, but it reports bogus numbers
<hackergirl>	Px42 nethogs does it by process which is convenient
<px42>	hackergirl: ok
<annihilannic>	Trefex: or monitorix looks promising.
<Trefex>	and for io?
<px42>	hackergirl: i suppose nethogs supported only on linux
<px42>	??
<hackergirl>	You might like vnstst too
<hackergirl>	As far as im aware yes only linux
<px42>	px42: what if the device is not runninx linux
<px42>	sorry hackergirl
<hackergirl>	Hmm windows?  Mac? Solaris?  Amiga?
<aib>	annihilannic: I want to do "if [ exitcode(command) -eq 128 ]; then ..." I know I can execute the command and use $? in the if, but I'd rather put the command right inside the if
<Trefex>	iptraf-ng reports 500 MBps out, and nethogs reports 140 KB/s, so there's that.. not sure why
<annihilannic>	aib: simply 'if command ; then ... ; fi' would work for 0 or non-0 exit status, but to test for 128 specifically you'd still have to do what you're doing.
<hackergirl>	500MBps is 4000000kbps whis is really fast too fast false positive maybe u running both same time?
<kraftb>	Trefex: does iptraf report the 500MBps in total or only for the vpn connection?
<aib>	annihilannic: I see. The closest I've come is $(command; echo $?) but it feels a bit hacky. Something like $?(command) would have been helpful. Anyway, thank you.
<Trefex>	kraftb: not talking about VPN, but it's 500 MBps on the eth0 interface
<annihilannic>	aib: slightly hacky but not too hacky I think :-)
<px42>	 hackergirl: Sorry actually device is based on linux. But I don't have shell access on the device. I was thinking on the line to hook on the network and monitor it
<disc0very>	brb see u later
<hackergirl>	Ahh gotcha
<kraftb>	sorry ... mixed up who said what
<triceratux>	BluesKaj: thankx. appreciate it. everyone can go back to being bored :)
<hackergirl>	You could use a shared bridge or proxy box and monitor it thatway
<kraftb>	just saw you were talking about bandwith tools.
<kraftb>	I prefer iptraf too
<Trefex>	kraftb: well i'm wondering if there's better one, and why nethogs report crap
<kraftb>	but didn't know wheter it could show enough information for vpn connections as well.
<kurahaupo>	aib, annihilannic: this sounds like the sort of question that would be better asked in #bash
<px42>	hackergirl: could u explan a bit
<Trefex>	kraftb: same goes for a good IO tool, that shows current usage, preferrably that works well with ZFS, iotop is not so "nice"
<hackergirl>	For total data usage try vnstat
<kraftb>	just typing "ifconfig" will show the real in/out traffic
<kraftb>	if you assume the kernel isn't buggy
<kraftb>	or ifconfig :)
<hackergirl>	Pm me px42
<BluesKaj>	triceratux, I couldn't resist stating the obvious :-)
<Trefex>	well TX Bytes is 0
<Trefex>	so something is wrong there
<px42>	hackergirl: ok
<kurahaupo>	aib: if command; ((e=$?, e==128 || e==0)); then ... ; fi
<aib>	kurahaupo: oh, I can do if command; [ $? == 128]; then ... ?
<kurahaupo>	aib: the spaces around [ ] are important, and if you're using because your shell doesn't have (()), you'd better use = instead of == as well
<kurahaupo>	aib: but yes, that overall structure will work
<gammy>	I've not kept up but could you also not use a OR without using test? Then I guess you wouldn't filter on exactly 128 though
<gammy>	ie, `if ! command; then`
<aib>	gammy: it's not about or, it's about executing the command and having to use $? as opposed to something like $?(command) == 128. you know, with the command right next to the compared exit code
<TaevMac>	Im trying to install Skype on SuSE, latest versions of both. i use RPM it installs successfully when i hit the gui icon it disapears, when i run it via command as normal user or as sudo i get "Aborted"
<TaevMac>	any ideas please?
<gammy>	 `command || { ..`  ? Or am I still misunderstanding
<gammy>	I also think bash has exit codes in a stack
<aib>	gammy: I need the exact value, &&/|| don't cut it
*	gammy nods
<gammy>	well your suggestion should work fine, yes?
<aib>	kurahaupo: how about -eq instead of = or ==, inside [ ] ?
<gammy>	foo=0; if [ $foo = 0 ]; then ..
<gammy>	aib, eq is used for strings
<aib>	ah
<gammy>	No, I'm sorry, that's not true. Bah. I'm not used to this realtime stuff (IRC) :D
<gammy>	you're actually spot on I think aib
<gammy>	so [ $? -eq 127 ]
<annihilannic>	gammy: you're confusing it with perl :-)
<gammy>	OR, "cast" to string
<gammy>	annihilannic, That's right :)
<stangeland>	Hi there...is it possible to reset the root passwd on my machine?
<gammy>	if [ "$?" = "0" ]; then
<annihilannic>	stangeland: yes, use the 'passwd' command as root.
<gammy>	that'll work as you expect, I think, aib. Both of them.
<peetaur2>	stangeland: on boot up, edit kernel command line; append   init=/bin/bash   and then when you boot it, run passwd to set a password
<gammy>	if [ "0" = "1" ]; then ... if [ 0 -eq 1 ]; then..
<peetaur2>	stangeland: http://www.symantec.com/connect/forums/recover-root-grub
<aib>	kurahaupo: gammy: thank you. https://github.com/aib/dotfiles/blob/master/.zshrc#L77
<gammy>	aib, As an aside, I've once used some magic to catch the return code from a piped background exec. Ie, command | command | command &; bg_pids="$! $(jobs -p)"
<gammy>	aib,Another tip: "[" is actually just a link to the "test" program/builtin, so you can see the condition options via "man test"
<aib>	gammy: hahahah, nice hack. I think I stumbled upon something like $PIPEEXITS[n] in bash a couple of minutes ago.
<stangeland>	peetaur2: hmmm i tried following that guide but my grub is different
<stangeland>	annihilannic: i cannot log in as root, i have forgotten the root password
<aib>	gammy: that'll save me a few googles every time I want to write a shell script. thanks :)_
<gammy>	Indeed :D
<peetaur2>	stangeland: it's all basically the same, either grub-legacy or grub2, and whatever is different will show up on screen like hitting b or ctrl=x or f10 or whatever to boot
<peetaur2>	stangeland: so try it anyway, and just edit the "linux ... vmlinuz..." line; post a camshot if you get stuck
<peetaur2>	stangeland: the howto says 0.97 so it is grub-legacy
<Amm0n>	Hey guys! Since i upgraded spacefm to v1.0.1, spacefm --desktop isn't drawing my wallpaper anymore. If i try to set it in terminal it appears, but it vansihes if i close this terminal...
<Psi-Jack>	spacefm?
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<Amm0n>	yes the filemanager
<Psi-Jack>	Never heard of it.
*	solotitan is now known as Guest85329
<Psi-Jack>	Though, screenshots of it look aweful. heh
<peetaur2>	stangeland: another option is to boot a live cd / rescue cd and mount the fs and edit /etc/shadow (or chroot and use passwd command)
<hackergirl>	Yep same here haven't heard of it lol
<peetaur2>	stangeland: the general rule is: if you don't have physical security, you basically have no security :)
<Psi-Jack>	peetaur2: Does having a wall-mounted automatic aiming minigun at my entryways count? :D
<Amm0n>	Psi-Jack, its great.. it has a design mode, splitview etc..
<limbo>	stangeland: if nothing else, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack
<Psi-Jack>	Amm0n: Yeah? So does dolphin.
<hackergirl>	So true most places I offer network security thoes who deny it have god aweful physical security last place like that the business still used 2 pronged keys for their doors
<peetaur2>	Psi-Jack: yes I believe so
<Amm0n>	Psi-Jack, ok, can dolphin automount without gvfs and fuse?
<pingo>	http://www.xmailserver.org/ Anyone know if this thing can pass emails to an external program or script upon receipt?
<Psi-Jack>	Amm0n: Dolphin doesn't ise gvfs, it uses kio, and fuse as appropriate.
<Psi-Jack>	Both of which are userspace, not requiring privileged access.
<Psi-Jack>	gvfs is one of those crappy Gnome things. :)
<Amm0n>	yeah i like to keep it simple thats why i used spacefm with udevil
<Psi-Jack>	Sounds insecure.
<cldbeadctv>	if you are so good Psi-Jack why dont you release a distro ... RH know that your pitiful mind
<Psi-Jack>	cldbeadctv: Because I don't want to maintain it. :p
*	metastableb is now known as metastableB_
<cldbeadctv>	what a loss to the world of linux
<Psi-Jack>	And.. What?
<gypsymauro>	hi, I've ~ 50 Gb of mails, stored in different Maildir folders, I want to find a specified email address on the whole archive, I can use grep -r but is this the fastest way to achieve that?
<Psi-Jack>	gypsymauro: Use an IMAP server that supports proper indexing. Like dovecot. :p
<limbo>	gypsymauro: if you just need to do it once yes. if you are gonna need to find many different many times, you should index it somehow.
<Psi-Jack>	Or kmail/kontact which can index locally through baloo.
<gypsymauro>	no is just one time shot :)
<limbo>	gypsymauro: then grep might be faster, you might want to just look through the top of the mails though. if the from/to headers are high enough
<Psi-Jack>	cldbeadctv: Anyway, keep your insults to /dev/null. They're not welcome in ##linux.
<cldbeadctv>	it was an observation
<limbo>	gypsymauro: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8940652/make-grep-stop-after-first-non-matching-line  <-- that stuff might help save some time :)
<cldbeadctv>	you demean so many thinbgs and your way is the only way\
<stangeland>	peetaur2: sorry...i gotta ask again...this is the window i get when i press 'e'. http://ibin.co/229NQgbwBtni   What do i edit in here to reset the root passwd to something else?
<limbo>	gypsymauro: to make sure you only read headers, and ignore the data
<Psi-Jack>	cldbeadctv: No, people have their own opinions. Yes, I may not like something, that doesn't mean they shouldn't do it. Now, when it comes to something that can have wrong ways to do things, that's a different story altogether.
<peetaur2>	stangeland: the linux line... after the ..._handoff thing, add  " init=/bin/bash", and then something like f10 to boot (the key should be printed on the bottom of the screen or somewhere)
<cldbeadctv>	thats my observation
*	metastableB_ is now known as metastableb

*	KayAteChef is now known as Guest51388
<Psi-Jack>	Anyway. Good ol Linux stuff. :)
<Psi-Jack>	Amm0n: Either way, despite my own feelings on that, it seems nobody here but you, presently anwyay, actually uses spacefm and udevil. Before you I'd never even heard of it myself.
<stangeland>	peetaur2: aha....so then where do i set the new password i want?
<peetaur2>	stangeland: after you boot, you get a linux shell... and then just run normal commands to change it. The howto I linked first suggests remount rw ... not sure if that is necessary, then either "passwd" command (recommended), or edit /etc/shadow (fallback)
<peetaur2>	editing shadow is mostly useful if you have a hash but not plaintext and you want to paste it there
<peetaur2>	but usermod -p '...' will also take the hash
<gammy>	Sorry peetaur2 and stangeland, can't you just chroot after mounting? Perhaps this is what you're doing
<peetaur2>	gammy: yes you can do that also; but then you need another boot media, and have to add more instructions for mounting instead of just editing a grub line
<peetaur2>	and I mentioned it up there somewhree
<stangeland>	peetaur2: arg.... when i pressed f10 i get this: Target filesystem doesn't have requested /bin/bash".
<gammy>	peetaur2, Indeed; I've not been following your conversation; excuse my ignorance :)
<Terr>	Hmm, I have a silly question: what are files in ".d" directories (conf.d, rc.d, etc.) called? Are they called fragments?
<peetaur2>	stangeland: heh okay that's weird. Well you can try a different shell... /bin/dash maybe (Ubuntu should have that .... but also should have bash)
<Amm0n>	Psi-Jack, its not that unknown, its in the repositories of archlinux
<peetaur2>	stangeland: maybe send a screenshot of your entry before f10  ... maybe it was a typo
<gammy>	Terr, I think they're just called files
<gammy>	There's nothing special about them, right
<Psi-Jack>	Amm0n: So mayhaps have you asked about it in #archlinux? ;)
<stangeland>	peetaur2: but i cannot get back
<peetaur2>	stangeland: just reboot to go back
<cldbeadctv>	Terr, they are snippets of conf files that you can indivudally edit and they are included in the initialisation of the said application
<Terr>	gammy: you're right, nothing special, I was just wondering if there was better way to refer to them than "include all files from /etc/httpd/conf.d" because each file only contains a fragment of the whole config
<Terr>	but fragments or snippets are not a recognized name for these files?
<kraftb>	Terr: exim calls them splitted conf files
<kraftb>	but I don't think there is a common name for such files
<gammy>	I've never really thought about it like that.I mean, each file is usually contained for its purpose amyway.
<kraftb>	or at least it calls the whole feature "splitted conf files" instead of one large config file
<cldbeadctv>	many applications use it
<Terr>	kraftb: that's a sensible name too
<kerframil>	Terr: some might refer to them as includes
<gypsymauro>	limbo: yes of course :)  thanx
<gammy>	Looking at my homemade bash chainloader, I call such files "components"
<gammy>	But, yeah. Whatever. :) Maybe you can be the trendsetter for a new, more appropriate name!
<kraftb>	often (like for udev) they are prefixed with 10- 20- designating the load order
<Terr>	interesting, all these names :)
<brammator>	I use "screen" to log session to file and want to archive old unused logs.  How to bind logfiles to active sessions?  Can't find anything related in "escape strings" section of manual page
<gammy>	kraftb, mm, in my script here I do a naughty "find "$scriptpath" -maxdepth 1 -type f -iname "*.bash" | sort -n" and then source them
<Terr>	I guess ill stick to "files", to not add to the confusion :P
<gammy>	which would work with that scheme.
<stangeland>	peetaur2: this is how i wrote it: http://ibin.co/229TUuQAOID5
<peetaur2>	stangeland: oh... just remove the quotes

<gammy>	Ha!
<gammy>	Always a source of issues, that..
<stangeland>	peetaur2: nice now i have root terminal :) ill just run passwd then...i can also change password for any user right?
<peetaur2>	conor_f: pacman -R laptop-mode-tools
<gammy>	stangeland, yes
<peetaur2>	conor_f: there is an alternative that is better... I don't know the name; you can probably find it online
<conor_f>	peetaur2: why/what is laptop-mode-tools?
<peetaur2>	why = I don't know.... what = it is the evil that must be purged
<gammy>	A package containing a bunch of tools for power management et al
<peetaur2>	something for power saving I guess...
<conor_f>	gammy: peetaur2: thanks. Looking it all up on archwiki now
<peetaur2>	stangeland: yes, you're root, so you can change any without a password (assuming root is rw not read-only)
<stangeland>	peetaur2: uhhh when i run passwd stianas and type in the password i want, it says: "Authentication token manipulation error" "password unchanged"
<gammy>	Yes, it does a bunch of different stuff, including some aggressive disk power consumption stuff.
<peetaur2>	stangeland: touch /testfile ; rm /testfile    was it read only? if so,   mount -o remount,rw /
<gammy>	conor_f, you might find more cluses (if it is indeed a laptop mode problem) using powertop from intel
<peetaur2>	(which was in the grub-legacy howto I linked)
<stangeland>	yay
<stangeland>	:D
<stangeland>	peetaur2: and to change passwd for root i do $passwd root right?
<peetaur2>	stangeland: should be # insteade of $ ;)   and yeah but root is optional; default is current user
<gammy>	stangeland, hm as root? "passwd" alone to change the root password, and then "passwd <user>" to change the password for the user. *as* root. :)
<gammy>	Probably. *mumbles to himself*
<stangeland>	peetaur2: nice...and then just kill the power to start normally with new pwd right?
<peetaur2>	stangeland: shutdown -r now
<peetaur2>	and yeah, run as normal then, with new passwords
<stangeland>	peetaur2: well then i just get "unable to shutdown system"
<peetaur2>	heh oh
<peetaur2>	well then try     for x in r e i s u b; do echo "$x" > /proc/sysrq-trigger; sleep 1; done
<gammy>	stangeland, three-finger salute
<peetaur2>	yeah or three fingers works
<gammy>	:)
<peetaur2>	or you'd think so anyway
<gammy>	procfs probably isn't mounted anyway
<peetaur2>	I wonder if my loop there would even work.... since one of the first few will kill your shell... ;)
<peetaur2>	better make it     s u b  and not the rest
<gammy>	Haha
<gammy>	Poor man's reboot, with some excitement: cat /dev/random > /dev/mem
<gammy>	Or maybe that's not possible anymore. Ahem.

<peetaur2>	it can corrupt the disk if it is currently being written to
<gammy>	Magic!
<Psi-Jack>	Heh yeah
<Psi-Jack>	gammy: And that.. Sir.. You should NOT have even said, as peetaur2 pointed out can be extremely destructive.
<gammy>	Indeed. My apologies. Bad joke.
<stangeland>	peetaur2: wauw....amazing :D that worked hehehe
<stangeland>	peetaur2: yaaaaaaaaaaaay now i have access to my files again :D thanks so much...you are a godsend :)
<peetaur2>	no prob
<viscera>	i ran gammy's command and now funny characters are appearing on the screen. why isn't my system rebooting?

<deekej>	hey guys! I know I was using an utility few years back, which name I completey forgot and I cannot google it nor find it. It's supposed to provide small cmdline wizard and then initialize the working directory for the start of open-source project, based on the answers in wizard. Does it ring any bells to anybody?

<super_mrwu>	intelikey: which nation are you in?
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: Yeah.. similar to what I do then.
<peetaur2>	and for some reason someone made one called 'bzr' which seems to do nothing better than git, but it is more similar to svn than git
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: Using the 'free' client as an agent, that backs up to the machine that has the subscription
<super_mrwu>	intelikey: North Korea? Mainland China?
<intelikey>	super_mrwu  no no no.  it's local filter
<Psi-Jack>	Dominian: Does that actually work?
<super_mrwu>	intelikey: haha
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: hehe yep
<intelikey>	super_mrwu  at work.
<Psi-Jack>	Reaally? You can use the "friends" backup and it'll still go to cloud?
<Dominian>	Nothing will stop it
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: Well, sure.. I'm just pushing the backup to a directory on the server with the subscription, then on the server with the subscription, backup that 'backup' folder to the cloud
<gammy>	Sorry, jusyt read that viscera ran my command, I hope you don't mean by `cat` command.
<gammy>	"just"
<Psi-Jack>	Dominian: Ahhhh. :)
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: they have no way of stopping you
<Psi-Jack>	Dominian: That's cheating, but yeah, it works I suppose. LOL
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: oh it's definitely cheating, but didn't see anything in their terms of use barring it
<Psi-Jack>	Dominian: I have a Family Plan so I have the 10 accounts. :)
<Dominian>	Yes.. I want to get that eventually
<Psi-Jack>	For me, it was easier, since there's me an the wife, and my servers, and I wanted individualization, especially for each desktop.
<Psi-Jack>	And, I don't have the storage capacity to store everything in one spot. :)
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: Yeah
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: Makes sense.
<intelikey>	no ideas?   oh well.
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: but if you see somethin gin their terms of Use I missed... let me know lol
<Psi-Jack>	Really need to get me a good Synology with 5 drive bays. :D
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: I thought about a true 'nas'...
<Psi-Jack>	Dominian: For what you're doing. Nothing covers it being bad. :)
<triceratux>	intelikey: if theyre not filtering google this might get you started https://www.google.com/search?q=mc_4.8.14-1_i386.deb
<Dominian>	but with this crashplan subscription... don't really need it
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: Yeah.. I got the initial backup done last night.. will probably set it to do 15 min increments tonight
<Psi-Jack>	Dominian: Heh, I want a Synology because I want large capacity, high speed access, and shared access for virtual machines, and backups.
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: yeah that makes ense
<Psi-Jack>	Right now, I have just 2 hypervisors, and localized storage on each these days. Cheaper for the electricty than my former 7-server setup. :)
<Dominian>	lol yeah
<Dominian>	I really n eed to build a new monster machine.. so I can virtualize some stuff
<Dominian>	True hypervisor setup.. esxi or something.
<Dominian>	and I'm debating going back to a hardware firewall.. something like Edgerouter LIte
<Dominian>	lite*
<Psi-Jack>	I need to upgrade one of my hypervisors from a AMD Athlon Phenom II X4 to an AMD FX 8-core or better, and get more RAM. :)
<kraftb>	sad theres no "apt-get install wikipedia" :(
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: hehe
<Psi-Jack>	Dominian: I have been looking for a good low-powered ARM or similar device that actually has two Gbit Ethernet ports, so I could build my own router into it.
<kraftb>	It would be quite an easy task to build a deb package which fetches and configures mediawiki
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: that's similar to what I was looking at... the Edgerouter series is NICE
<peetaur2>	Dominian: why not kvm? simple and clean, no crippleware :P
<kraftb>	and to create an installer which retrieves the wikipedia data tarballs via torrent
<Dominian>	peetaur2: Oh.. I haven't really settled to be honest.
<Psi-Jack>	Dominian: Yeah, but I want it < $100. :)
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: Hmm Edgerouter lite isn't that expensive is it?
<patarr>	If I echo a 1 or 0 into a /proc/sys config of let's saaay TCP, will that persist on reboot?
<Psi-Jack>	Not sure. :)
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: http://www.amazon.com/EdgeRouter-ERLite-3-512MB-Ethernet-Router/dp/B00CPRVF5K
<Psi-Jack>	Oh, Ubiquity.. No thank you. ;)
<Dominian>	hahaha
<Dominian>	Come on.. they got good stuff
<annihilannic>	patarr: no.
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: their access points are insanely awesome
<Psi-Jack>	Dominian: Oh wait, Ubiquity.. Maker of that UniFi?
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: changing gears, the fun part, I have a headless VPS I need to backup with Crashplan.. configuring that is going to be fun :)
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: yes
<Psi-Jack>	Ahh, okay, yeah, never used one yet.
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: theya re badass
<Psi-Jack>	Hmmm. I keep hearing that. :/
*	[BNC]Savemech is now known as Savemech
<Dominian>	I eventually want to swap out everything in my house, wifi wise, with their APs, but that's going to take some time
<Dominian>	iirc, with theirs, you don't need a wireless controller as it handles everything itself
<Dominian>	which makes it ideal.
<Psi-Jack>	Hmmm...
<Psi-Jack>	This EdgeRouter Lite actually doesn't look bad, at first glance.
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: yeah, I know quite a few people who run that exact model and love it
<Psi-Jack>	Both WebUI and CLI interfacing..
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: and these guys are IT experts that use these
<Dominian>	Probably one of my next buys
<Psi-Jack>	Specific IPv6 support, QoS, Heck.. Even OSPF RIP and BGP.
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: yep.. amazing he?
<Dominian>	eh?
<Psi-Jack>	For <$100!
<Dominian>	they have some NICE switches too
<patarr>	annihilannic, how do I make it persist
<Pr0x1mu5>	http://catb.org/esr/writings/unix-koans/ten-thousand.html
<Pr0x1mu5>	this is hilarious
<kraftb>	any volunteers ?
<deekej>	Dominian, peetaur2: I found it finally - I was looking for 'autoproject' utility. ;)
<Dominian>	deekej: ahhh cool
<Psi-Jack>	Dominian: I'd presume the EdgeRouter Lite here would support some static IP address assignments, in both IPv4 and IPv6, with firewall rules for it all so I could do 1:1 NAT and port forwarding depending on which destination IP?
<Ulrar>	Is there a way to know why a partition has been marked as Faulty by mdraid ?
<Ulrar>	The disk, according to smartctl, is healty, and the other partition on it aren't marked as Faulty
<patarr>	Can anyone tell me how I can have my /proc/sys configurations persist on reboot?
<kraftb>	Ulrar: you could try "badblocks"
<Psi-Jack>	Ulrar: Check logs.
<Ulrar>	kraftb: Ha, don't know that one
<kraftb>	theres a destructive mode also
<kraftb>	but I guess that isn't what you want to use before having done a backup or put in a spare
<Ulrar>	ACPI Error: Method parse/execution failed [\_SB_.PCI0.SAT0.SPT3._GTF] (Node ffff8807f40a4898), AE_NOT_FOUND (20130328/psparse-537)
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: that's my undersatnding
<Psi-Jack>	Ulrar: ACPI has nothing to do with HDD.
<Ulrar>	Well I do have backups, and two other member in the raid1 so it's ok
<Psi-Jack>	Dominian: You say you have guys that use this?
<Ulrar>	Psi-Jack: That's what I get at the same second it's been marked as faulty
<kraftb>	and then theres hdparm
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: I haven't had a chance to really use one yet, but a frine dof mine has a pretty complex network setup at home and uses it as his head end router.. does all kind of static assignments, vlans, bgp.. you name it
<Ulrar>	I guess the relevant line is ata4: hard resetting link
<Psi-Jack>	Ulrar: That has nothing to do with raid or disks.
<kraftb>	Ulrar could also be a faulty controller
<Psi-Jack>	Yeah, that's more likely, but there's more.
<kraftb>	I guess doing a badblocks on another system could determine if the disk is the problem.
<Psi-Jack>	Dominian: Hmmm
<Ulrar>	Psi-Jack: http://dpaste.com/1SM58Y4
<Psi-Jack>	Ulrar: Looks like HDD failing.
<Psi-Jack>	Either underpowered, or just plain dying.
*	conor_f is now known as conor_f[away]
<Ulrar>	Let's try some smartctl self test then
<Psi-Jack>	conor_f[away]: Please, don't let us know when you're on the toilet, afk, or anything else. We really don't need to see it in our large nearly 2,000 user channel.
<Psi-Jack>	Ulrar: SMART won't always tell you an HDD is going bad.
<Dominian>	Nope.
<Ulrar>	Psi-Jack: Yeah but they won't change it if smartctl doesn't show anything
<reisio>	Narp
<Dominian>	Had that happen to a client last week and I had to detail it out on 'why' it wasn't detected.
<Ulrar>	Or at least I never managed to make them change it
<benzrf>	hey!!
<reisio>	heyo
<Dominian>	Ulrar: What does your smartctl health output for the drive look like?
<benzrf>	is there a way to make something like a fifo pipe but
<Psi-Jack>	Ulrar: Well, you already have the warning signs of failure in your kernel logs.
<benzrf>	instead, you have a pair of files, in duplex?
<Dominian>	Some of the factors detailed within that health table can be 'indicators' to the drie failing
<reisio>	benzrf: ?
<Ulrar>	Dominian: No error logged, 15304 hours on
<Ulrar>	I guess I'll try Psi-Jack, thanks
<Dominian>	not talking about error logs.
<Dominian>	There should be a listed table with 'read errors' write errors.. blah blah
<Psi-Jack>	Yeah. :)
<benzrf>	like, "$ mksocks a b", then "$ echo bleh > a" followed by "$ cat b" gives "bleh"
<Psi-Jack>	I've seen drives, many drives, where SMART showed pristine health, but the firmware and/or drive motor itself was failing, until it wouldn't even be detected by BIOS anymore.
<Psi-Jack>	And would lock up, freeze, delay writes, until death.
<reisio>	always a waste of time, smart :p
<Psi-Jack>	SMART's useful, but can't be 100% relied upon.
<Ulrar>	Dominian: I see attribute, error logs and self test
<reisio>	no it is useful
<reisio>	for people with buildings full of drives
<reisio>	and buildings full of spare drives
<Ulrar>	reisio: I disagree, we catched a LOT of failing drive thanks to smart
<reisio>	no you don't :p
<reisio>	but if it's truly a lot, you have a building
<reisio>	and also, you have someone buying poor drives :p
<reisio>	or you're using raid :p
<Ulrar>	all of the above
<Ulrar>	:)
<reisio>	heh
<Dominian>	Ulrar: pastebin: smartctl --all /dev/<whatever the drive is>
<reisio>	you don't need smartmon to tell you raid drives are dying
<Ulrar>	Dominian: http://dpaste.com/16MDGB7
<benzrf>	hmm, unrelated question:
<kraftb>	and if its the controller maybe the smart stuff wont work
<benzrf>	if i make a device file with mknod, what can i do with it?
<Ulrar>	reisio: Our monitoring checks smartctl -a frenquently, we often have errors logged
<benzrf>	are there system calls that allow a driver to attach to a device file?
<Ulrar>	Well it's not perfect, for sure
<kraftb>	benzrf: write a kernel driver which acts upon it :)
<benzrf>	ah, ok
<benzrf>	i assumed that they were virtual files like /proc/ entries
<Psi-Jack>	benzrf: In the olden days, everything in /dev/ was created by mknod.
<Dominian>	Well, acording to smart the drive doesn't have any prefails.. but.. that doesn't mean anythin...hardware failure itself within the drive can be causing your issues as well... or loose cables.
<Fr3d3r1c>	hello i need your help for proftpd please
<Fr3d3r1c>	after to add this line in my console, i can't connect me on my ftp : ftpasswd --passwd --name=culturacraft --uid=5002 --gid=5002 --home=/var/www/html
<kraftb>	a device driver can handle a major/minor number and will get any ioctl and/or read/writes to the device
<benzrf>	so device files are /not/ entries in an FS implemented by a driver?
<Fr3d3r1c>	and i have this in my log : unable to use DefaultRoot '~/' [resolved to '/var/www/html/']:
<Fr3d3r1c>	help me please
<Ulrar>	Dominian: Well I'll ask them to check / change the drive, we'll see of the kernel log is sufficient for that
<Ulrar>	Thanks a lot anyway
<Psi-Jack>	Fr3d3r1c: #1 question of all questions: Why are you trying to use that decrepid and insecure protocol, FTP?
<Dominian>	welcome
<Fr3d3r1c>	normaly, i should have access to /var/www/html
<Fr3d3r1c>	i need the ftp protocol for wordpress
<Psi-Jack>	Oh gawds.
<Psi-Jack>	That makes it even WORSE! :p
<Ulrar>	Fr3d3r1c: Any reason to not use sftp ?
<Fr3d3r1c>	yes, wordpress use onlye ftp and ftps
<Fr3d3r1c>	i use sftp only with my root account
<Ulrar>	You mean you have a wordpress plugin doing stuff with FTP ?
<Fr3d3r1c>	wordpress need ftp connection to add plugin
<Psi-Jack>	Fr3d3r1c: Heh, Expect your Wordpress to be violated and rooted in T-Minus 30 minutes. ;)
<deniska>	my wordpress install doesn't use ftp to add plugins >_>
<deniska>	you are doing something wrong <_<
<Psi-Jack>	Fr3d3r1c: Install plugins the correct and more sane secure way.
<Fr3d3r1c>	i have ubuntu server and wordpress need ftp connexion
<Psi-Jack>	Wordpress does /NOT/ need FTP.
<Fr3d3r1c>	i have dreamed maybe -_-
<Ulrar>	Never saw that, we have plenty of wordpresses and never needed FTP
<benzrf>	can i get bash to tell me what tty device file it's attached to
<Fr3d3r1c>	you can't help me with proftpd ?
<Fr3d3r1c>	say me it and i leave this room
<Kingsy>	if I have a cron expression like this --> 0 0 1 ? * MON * <-- what type of expression is that? it doesnt seem to be valid in my web app
<Ulrar>	Fr3d3r1c: You have a permition problem I guess
<Fr3d3r1c>	yes and i'm a professional linux user....
<Psi-Jack>	Fr3d3r1c: Heh, a "professional" user? :)
<Kingsy>	are there different types of cron expressions for different system types?
<Ulrar>	Does the user with the 5002 uid have read and execution rights on /var /var/www and /var/www/html
<peetaur2>	Fr3d3r1c: Psi-Jack: deniska: wordpress asks you for ftp credentials as a fallback after it gets a permission denied error
<Fr3d3r1c>	it's a joke, i'm a noob
<peetaur2>	which can easily be casued by apparmor/selinux, or simple chmod/chown used incorrectly
<Fr3d3r1c>	i don't know how to set the permission with wordpress
<deniska>	well, then set correct permissions on your www root =)
<Psi-Jack>	peetaur2: Yeah, or you can do things the more secure way, and install plugins yourself.
<Fr3d3r1c>	anyway, i want to use proftpd to
<deniska>	I bet copying the files using root account caused it
<Ulrar>	Probably
<Psi-Jack>	Fr3d3r1c: Doing so, you will guarantee exploitation to yourself.
<kraftb>	maybe he just wants that proftpd running and just uses wordpress as subterfuge
<Ulrar>	kraftb: That'd be something new
<Psi-Jack>	Fr3d3r1c: I don't personally want to help you become a turret.
<Fr3d3r1c>	you can't help me, ok i understand
<Psi-Jack>	s/can't/won't/
<kraftb>	whats the problem with it?
<Ulrar>	Fr3d3r1c: He's right though
<kraftb>	doesn't run? doesn't allow logins?
<rascul>	eww ftp
<kraftb>	meanwhile: you could use an usb stick to transfer wordpress plugins to your server.
<kraftb>	if you have physical access
<rascul>	wordpress can do plugin stuff on its own, no need for sneakernet
<Fr3d3r1c>	you want a screenshot ?
<Psi-Jack>	Heh
<kraftb>	usually installing proftpd is quite easy
<kraftb>	at least with ubuntu/debian
<Fr3d3r1c>	it's easy for advanced user
<Fr3d3r1c>	i'm a noob
<rascul>	never install ftp daemon
<kraftb>	which distri ?
<Fr3d3r1c>	and the tutorials on internet are imperfect
<Fr3d3r1c>	no perfect
<rascul>	fix whateve the real issue is, in this case, wordpress not having permissions it needs
<kraftb>	maybe he is not concerned about security because some kind of intranet?
<Fr3d3r1c>	anyway, i need to install proftpd too
<rascul>	intranet isn't an excuse to skip security
<kraftb>	but they are right: ftp is quite insecure
<Fr3d3r1c>	i'm a noob, do i need to repeat it again ?
<kraftb>	well ... at home I use netcat
<kraftb>	theres no internet connection.
<kraftb>	at least I don't want an internet there
<kraftb>	so I do not have to care about security. Or should I?
<hackergirl>	:)
<Psi-Jack>	Fr3d3r1c: You should learn, properly, then.
<kraftb>	of course when doing internet stuff I use scp, ssh, and gpg | netcat
<rascul>	if security to you means using ssh instead of netcat, i don't think i can help you much
<Fr3d3r1c>	learn with how ?
<kraftb>	no interent there is also the reason I am looking for volunteers for "apt-get install wikipedia"
<Fr3d3r1c>	only in my house, with approximalty tutorial on internet
<Fr3d3r1c>	?
<Haxxa>	I literally had a debate 6 weeks ago when discussing flight computers people kept telling me the linux in flight computer is completey isolated to any electronic flight equiptment but then this happens - http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/05/fbi-researcher-admitted-to-hacking-plane-in-flight-causing-it-to-climb - article
<kraftb>	I guess I could do the wikimedia install stuff, and maybe the torrent-get stuff ... but I am debian packaging noob
<RusAlex>	what part of kernel responsible for default acl rules for new files under directory ?
<Psi-Jack>	RusAlex: The ACL part.
<RusAlex>	Psi-Jack: is it documented in kernel source code ?
<Psi-Jack>	RusAlex: Ask in ##kernel or LKML
<reisio>	or #smartmon
<hackergirl>	Haxxa: Yes when they had trouble with the PLC's at that nuclear facility a few years back their PLC system was not connected to the internet it was it's own LAN but the source of the problem was a USB stick and some awesome 0day exploits, they lost a lot because of it. Don't need the internet to create a problem just drop a usb stick called secret documents and someone will access it because curiosity killed the cat lol
<reisio>	irresponsible use of nuclear power helps, too :p
<Haxxa>	hackergirl, indeed going to here so many more cases as more and more computers control critical things like cars and homes - I think there needs to very strict laws in place leading to future for security
<foobark>	is there a default available tool that can be put in a pipe that forces a minimal blocksize? e.g. tar /lots_of_small_crap | supertool | ssh /tmp/tar
<Psi-Jack>	Hmm. INteresting.. SoftMaker Office is creating extensions for Thunderbird email client now for office/email integrations.
<billy71>	Is there a good ikev client for debian/linux/*nix?
<reisio>	foobark: split?
<billy71>	I want to connect to a ikev2 daemon.
<reisio>	foobark: trickle?
<Psi-Jack>	At least for their upcoming 2016 edition, currently in beta for Windows. :/
<kraftb>	foobark: xz ?
<kraftb>	it will compress it and only send out compressed blocks.
<reisio>	good luck with that
<reisio>	the movingest of awful targets
<daniele12457>	hi guys, has anyone worked with hw breakpoint?
<foobark>	reisio, doesn't split split it in several files?
<reisio>	crazy questions today :p
<hackergirl>	Haxxa, yeah we are the weakest link really 30% of all data breaches are classified under human error. The remote code execution and stuff is bad yes but it doesn't happen as often as someone not knowing what to so when caught in a social engineering hacking engagement. Anyway we are the weakest link lol we are human not perfect and the stats from the phonemon institute study show that clearly
<Psi-Jack>	daniele12457: Got a proper linux question instead of a question to ask questions?
<benzrf>	NO i dont plan to actually do this, BUT, is there some kind of low level system call to "attach" to a device file?
<benzrf>	i.e., become the backend for writes and reads
<Haxxa>	hackergirl, yer its a decent point
<kraftb>	benzrf: maybe fuse is what your are looking for
<kraftb>	at least for filesystems
<hackergirl>	Haxxa, yeah then the CA's out there the certificate authorities don't get me started on that international legal broken mess
<daniele12457>	actually I'm trying to debug a syscall I developed, but breakpoint doesn't seems to work well. it just hangs there. So i'm asking if anyone knows how to do it properly.
<benzrf>	kraftb: no, im wondering about how drivers work
<hackergirl>	are you using gdb?
<daniele12457>	openocd
<benzrf>	i found a tutorial that works with udev and uses some kind of call to create/register a device file
<daniele12457>	i have set a breakpoint to the entrypoint of the syscall
<triceratux>	then more desktop oses piping you directly to the nsa/tor network rofl http://blog.pcbsd.org/2015/05/pc-bsd-10-1-2-released/
<benzrf>	but if you were to mknod ahead of time, for example, is there some lower-level call that then attaches to an existing device file?
<hackergirl>	alright and it's not breaking for you there just skipping ahead?
<kraftb>	benzrf: hmm ... maybe there is some kind of user-space blockdevice driver
<Haxxa>	hackergirl, not familar with CA Authorities issues
<kraftb>	benzrf: search: userspace block device
<hackergirl>	have you set a breakpoint before that sys call or a few before then try stepping through see if you get any jumps or calls that direct you elsewhere first
<kraftb>	But I guess looking at existing device drivers gets you a good clue on how they work.
<daniele12457>	it's breaking but it seems that i after i call "resume/continue" it retrigger itself
<kraftb>	maybe from some really ancient linux version if you really care about the "how its done"
<hackergirl>	yeah if you resume/continue after any breakpoint it will resume/continue sounds like you need step functionality
<hackergirl>	It will continue usually to the next break point at this point you would have executed all the code from that syscall
<daniele12457>	yeah right
<benzrf>	kraftb: i am not asking about userspace
<daniele12457>	but it breaks again at the same point
<benzrf>	kraftb: im asking about how actual drivers work at a low level
<benzrf>	:p
<kraftb>	benzrf: So why don't you just look at existing kernel driverS?
<benzrf>	10:18 <benzrf> NO i dont plan to actually do this, BUT, ...
<daniele12457>	and im pretty sure i called the syscall 1 time
<hackergirl>	oh your breaking inside a syscall
<benzrf>	kraftb: because i am terrified of such things
<benzrf>	and i dont know where i'd look for that part
<benzrf>	:P
<kraftb>	read the source luke!
<benzrf>	besides,modern ones probably use udev
<daniele12457>	i can find the address inside /dev/kallsyms
<benzrf>	i guess im really asking about what underlies *udev*
<daniele12457>	like sys_hello()
<kraftb>	benzrf: Have a linux source somewhere ?
<kraftb>	if not goto linux.org and download a recent kernel and extract it
<benzrf>	shhoo
<hackergirl>	hmm yes
<hackergirl>	run the kernel through ida or something
<kraftb>	benzrf: What kind of device? block device or character device?
<hackergirl>	If you do that maybe you will find it but yet again you would have to do that live if your break pointing not into kernel development but I'd look at the kernel image in dissassembly to start
<daniele12457>	i try it with ida then
<daniele12457>	:)
<daniele12457>	ty
<daniele12457>	for the advice
<benzrf>	kraftb: either i guess :p
<hackergirl>	Yeah not easy stuff the kernel, not sure how you can breakpoint that live, only thing i can think of is compiling the source and doing a couple prints and try booting it from a VM
<hackergirl>	IDA Pro is industry standard so you might find what you are looking for there yeah
<kraftb>	benzrf: There are some guides about programming kernel module.
<Pessimist>	benzrf, there is struct file_operations
<kraftb>	they are a start to get to know the infrastructure.
<Pessimist>	It's used all over the kernel
<benzrf>	Pessimist: so is there some sort of system call that binds such a struct to a particular file
*	rt_ is now known as rt
<Pessimist>	benzrf, no, you use some subsystem to create such file and they provide a way to hook read/write and other functions on the file
<Pessimist>	sysfs, procfs, etc
<benzrf>	well then what is the utility of mknod historically
<kraftb>	there are a number of macros like MODULE_ALIAS, MODULE_PARAM_DESC, and functions like module_param, module_init which take care of the glue between a module and the kernel
<benzrf>	in days past when mknod was actually used, what did a driver do with the mk'd nod
<kraftb>	then there are defined structs which get passed to such a glue function. The structs contain pointers to the functions which can get called by the kernel.
<Pessimist>	benzrf, nowadays udev automatically creates those nodes that you used to do with mknod
<Fenikkusu>	This weekend I bought a HP Compaq 6005 USDT (4GB, Athlon II Dual Core). I intend to use this as a NAS Server utilizing NAS4Free/ZFS, which is built on FreeBSD. Once I got it home and tried install the software on it, and after spending the rest of the weekend trying to work on it, I learned that something with the BIOS of HP Computers prevents the FreeBSD bootloader from loading at all. That
<Fenikkusu>	being said, if I wish to continue using this server as a NAS (Which seems the perfect fit), I will need to set it up completly from scratch on linux instead of using the existing software. Does anyone have any suggestions and/or guides to what I would need to do to get started on this?
<benzrf>	Pessimist: i know x_x
<benzrf>	Pessimist: im asking about what udev replaces
<benzrf>	Pessimist: before udev and things like it, when mknod was actually used, how did things work?
<Pessimist>	It manages nodes in /dev
<benzrf>	i knowwwwwwwww
<kraftb>	benzrf: Maybe look at drivers/char/ppdev.c
<kraftb>	Its just 800 lines
<kraftb>	Its for the parport character device
<benzrf>	:\
<benzrf>	tfw languages where 800 lines is pretty small
<Psi-Jack>	Fenikkusu: 4GB, and dual-core, and you want to use ZFS? You're insane! :)
<kraftb>	benzrf: there's a struct "file_operations" which contains entries like ".read" and ".write" ... this is a template structure which points to the methods which should get called upon read/write to the ppdev device
<Pessimist>	kraftb, http://www.makelinux.net/ldd3/chp-3-sect-2
<Pessimist>	oops, benzrf
<benzrf>	kraftb: yeah
<benzrf>	kraftb: im asking, is there some system call that attaches that struct to a given device file
<kraftb>	benzrf: then theres a function "pp_attach" which is responsible for creating the device file (giving major and minor number)
<hackergirl>	In theory Fenikkusu you don't really need to install a specific distro for a file server could use samba
<benzrf>	is that how drivers were used with device files in the olden days
<Pessimist>	benzrf, system call - no. Look at that link
<kraftb>	benzrf: device_create()
<kraftb>	but its a kernel call
<benzrf>	kk
<kraftb>	I don't think (almost sure) you can create a "backend" for a device node in userspace.
<kraftb>	At least not without a special kernel module for this usecase
<benzrf>	idc
<kraftb>	If you want to be the "backend" for some file I guess what you are looking for is a pipe or fifo
<benzrf>	i told you
<benzrf>	this is just curiosity
<benzrf>	im using ptys for the actual thing im writing
<kraftb>	And I told you whats possible and what not
<benzrf>	this is just me wondering
<enoch>	hi all
<hackergirl>	hi enoch :)
<enoch>	is it possible to give a counter to iptables rule?
<enoch>	or time based rules?
<imorhi>	enoch: iptables reads top down
<enoch>	iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -s 10.0.0.127 -p tcp -m multiport --dports 80,443 -j DNAT --to-destination *.*.*.*:80  < i want this rule to apply only sometimes
<imorhi>	like at a time interval/
<enoch>	yes i have to interrupt the navigation with an ADV only 1 time per minute
<hackergirl>	iptables will list packet and byte counters if you specify option -v for verbose, e.g. iptables -vL. Likewise iptables-save will list all entries including the mentioned counters for each chain, but not for each table entry (on some systems iptables-save requires option -c to include counters).
<imorhi>	you could just have it run in a script and reload defalut when you want to go back
<benzrf>	thx for help tho :>
<hackergirl>	imorhi you could use iptables -F and then re-initate all your rules in some form of loop maybe
<yossarianuk>	hi - can anyone suggest a way to find the amount of files per folder in linux ?
<yossarianuk>	i.e /boot - 10 files /etc/2000 files , etc
<tilpner>	yossarianuk - I suppose you /could/ find /boot | wc -l
<peetaur2>	hackergirl: imorhi: pretty sure there's a -m <something> that does times...
<triceratux>	Haxxa: itz pretty basic https://www.google.com/search?q=ssl+certificate+authorities+%22web+of+trust%22+enforcement
<yossarianuk>	tilpner: I mean do all sub directories within a folder
<tilpner>	yossarianuk - I don't understand what you just said.
<Haxxa>	triceratux, will look later currently late into morning and have work in matter of hour
<Haxxa>	s
<Fenikkusu>	Psi-Jack, insane is trying to run it on a Raspberry PI 2 With 1GB memory or on an old Acer laptop that's better is completly dead and thunder rumbling could cause the power cord to lose a connection.
<reisio>	yossarianuk: like he said, find dir/ -type f | wc -l
<yossarianuk>	i.e I want to see how many files there are in each folder .
<Fenikkusu>	hackergirl, I also need access to AFP and if possible BitTorrent.
<yossarianuk>	reisio: that would show total amount of files, not per folder.
<Psi-Jack>	Heh, I just got a nice little pull request for a chef cookbook I wrote, yay! :D
<Fenikkusu>	that's battery is*
<reisio>	yossarianuk: it's per dir if you run it on a dir
<yossarianuk>	reisio: thanks, so I can one per folder, how can I see all subfolders ?
<yossarianuk>	i.e say i did
<yossarianuk>	cd /
<yossarianuk>	I want to know how many folders there are in each subfolder from /
<yossarianuk>	 I want to know how many *files* there are in each subfolder from /
<hackergirl>	I see, and why do you need it to be AFP you have lots of apple computers?
<reisio>	yossarianuk: find . -mindepth 1 -type d -exec bash -c 'echo -en "$(find "{}" -type f | wc -l)""\t"; echo "{}"' \;
<reisio>	yossarianuk: what're you going to do with that? :p
<yossarianuk>	reisio: thanks
<yossarianuk>	I'm actually trying to make sure that all folders within a directory have the same amount of files ...
<hackergirl>	Fenikkusu: you might want to read this http://straightedgelinux.com/blog/howto/afp.html and you may want to try rtorrent to be able to do torrents via terminal you could script that with cron jobs maybe and also parse a rss feed or something
<yossarianuk>	across 2 servers
<mocas>	I, I have a huawei k4201 and I would like to send sms on bash but I can't make the device to list on /dev like ttyUSB1.... maybe  I'm doin'd something wrong with usb_modeswitch.... any tip?
<spreeuw>	yossarianuk: also the same files?
<reisio>	yossarianuk: what does that matter?
<spreeuw>	then you can use rsync
<yossarianuk>	im using glusterfs
<spreeuw>	condolences
<yossarianuk>	i need to make sure that the bricks match beforer creating georeplication
<SimonB__>	Ok so I wrote a scipt that checks whether a user within their quota or it disabled mail to their maildir. However if I run the script manually as the user it runs with I get very different results than if it runs from cron. The results come from a "if [[ "$SIZE" -gt "$QUOTA" ]]" but I can't see why I get so man false positives...
<yossarianuk>	folder sizes are different (prehaps due to different underlying filesystem)
<reisio>	SimonB__: because those variables are different for each user?
<reisio>	yossarianuk: right, you'd want to compare files alone
<SimonB__>	yes, size if via du and the quota is from a mysql query
<SimonB__>	if=is
<yossarianuk>	its amount of files per sub folder I want really,....
<reisio>	mmhmm
<reisio>	you can use find with diff, handy for such things
<reisio>	diff -s <(find foo/ -type f -execdir cksum {} | sort) <(find bar/ -type f -execdir cksum {} | sort)
<reisio>	or just diff the wc -l
<SimonB__>	reisio: the script in question http://pastebin.com/uT5Hjr8c (it was only thrown together sadly).
<reisio>	SimonB__: just print those values, it should be obvious they differ

<hackergirl>	Hi Penguin
<Psi-Jack>	hackergirl: Yeah. I'd advise just ignoring Penguin. He'll correct your contractions till the day you die.
<Psi-Jack>	That's literally about 99% of all he ever does.
<arseny>	hello everybody user open source
<hackergirl>	Psi-Jack I'm good at computers, english is my first language and I'm terrible at it I can admit that lol it's alright if he corrects me I really could care less lol I know I'm bad at grammer and contractions and all of that confusing non-sense, languages should be more like math in my opinion
<zorak8>	hi, im trying to install slackware in a laptop that have a broken screen, only the left half of the screen is visible, i can see the first half of the screen, and the start of the promp. so in general i know what im doing
<korain>	>_> hackergirl must be a haskell fan
<reisio>	zorak8: hi...
<zorak8>	but i want to know if there a way to configure so the slackware only use half the screen
<tilpner>	hackergirl - So you've given up on improving your grammar skills?
<hackergirl>	Yes lol
<hackergirl>	I just lothe languages really do
<tilpner>	Sad. *shuts up*
<reisio>	zorak8: why not just replace the screen or laptop
<hackergirl>	I could go for haskell lol
<SimonB__>	reisio: just ammended the script to print out the veraibles whilst in the for loop. The du is getting very different results whether I'm running it or its running via cron. Even wilst as root.
<korain>	go > haskell
<reisio>	shhhh
<zorak8>	reisio: im going to use the laptop as a server
<korain>	heh /langtroll
<reisio>	zorak8: then just remote into it
<SimonB__>	it's doubling the result somehow...
<zorak8>	con i install the linux remote?
<zorak8>	how?
<peetaur2>	zorak8: attach a monitor that has the opposite half of the screen broken, and then use them together
<hackergirl>	tilpner french makes me so mad everything M or F for ever object on the face of the universe how practical is that garbage lol ;)
<baldfat>	korain go and Haskell are really not apples to apples
<reisio>	peetaur2: heheheh
<reisio>	zorak8: if you do have an external monitor, you could easily use that
<reisio>	but you could also install it remotely
<zorak8>	peetaur2: lol, dont have other monitor
<reisio>	how do you plan on using it remotely, then?
<zorak8>	how can i do that, install remote
<peetaur2>	zorak8: you could also open up the laptop, remove the vga cable, clean it, and put it back .... maybe it'll work
<hhmmm>	you can split the tty with gnu screen
<peetaur2>	zorak8: or use 'screen', and then use split mode
<hackergirl>	zorak8 perhaps try installing vnc or ssh into the box if you don't have a screen that works handy
<tilpner>	hackergirl - I'm not particularly fond of French myself, but I suspect that this lack of motivation might've been cause by my teachers, partially at least.
<baldfat>	zorak8: peetaur2 means Tmux when he said screen
<hhmmm>	le francais c'est cool
<peetaur2>	no I did not mean tmux
<peetaur2>	screen works great... never bothered to try tmux
<zorak8>	peetaur2: dont have the command screen
<baldfat>	peetaur2: well the whole arguement was that screen was dead and wasn't updated for 3 years and now ....
<zorak8>	my idea is to use the computer by ssh, but i need to install something there
<baldfat>	zorak8: https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/a-quick-tutorial-on-screen/
<barneygale>	tmux is pretty solid too
<korain>	baldfat: no but hackergirl mentioned both in the same sentence
<reisio>	so is screen
<hackergirl>	tilpner Yeah I took 2 years of french immersion biggest waste of my highschool life, the just make you memorize verbs. not a practical language at all. there are worse out there but that's one of them. English isn't the greatest either. It wasn't my teachers it's the whole concept I tried Spanish at uni too and just was failing so bad i dropped out to take avanced mathematics instead to get an A+
<baldfat>	korain: I just took it as a troll bait
<korain>	it kinda was
<zorak8>	the slackware install cd dont have the screen command
<reisio>	bumma
<peetaur2>	hackergirl: same story here, except no immersion... instead I told off the french teacher once. got suspended :D
<reisio>	ooh, I got suspended over my latin teacher
<reisio>	she stole my homework
<baldfat>	hackergirl: I took 2 years of ancient Hebrew and 2 years of non-Classical greek and I loved every minute of it
<reisio>	and when I took it back she got scared :p
<peetaur2>	hackergirl: and then bought a German book, married a German, spent a lazy short amount of time on that, and I know German way more than the many years of useless french class
<zorak8>	reisio: can explain how to install the linux remote?
<reisio>	lesson is: don't steal people's things, and you won't fear the repurcussions
<korain>	learning latin is like learning cobol
<reisio>	latin's useful
<korain>	..as useful as cobol
<reisio>	zorak8: the slackware channel can
<MrElendig>	peetaur2: and then invaded poland?
<reisio>	no, few languages are based on cobol
<reisio>	tons are based on latin
<reisio>	including more than half of what we call english
<peetaur2>	MrElendig: nein
<korain>	both are dead

<zorak8>	* Cannot join #slackware (Channel is invite only)
<zorak8>	mmm :/

<reisio>	zorak8: /msg #freenode you guys are clowns
<Psi-Jack>	I do love me my tmux, though.
<quantum-x>	reisio: was hoping for something automated, tehre's a bit of data ( https://gist.github.com/quantum-x/b8c6336ac6c75f8b2000 )
<naptr>	Psi-Jack: using tmux over five years, but now and then i still do: scre^H^H^H^Htmux
<Psi-Jack>	heh
<Psi-Jack>	I have a very customized tmux setup of my own, however it has only 1 issue with older versions. But that's okay, as it's a non-important feature. ;)
<miyalys>	Hi! Anyone know a good link with info about /dev/disk and the differences between them? (id, uid, label, partuuid, partlabel)
<reisio>	quantum-x: what's this fugliness from?
<reisio>	miyalys: labels are good
<Psi-Jack>	window-status-seperator doesn't work on tmux 1.6 which is the current version on EPEL for CentOS 6.
<naptr>	Psi-Jack: as long as i can turn off that nasty statusbar, i'm good.
<Psi-Jack>	Rather, EL6
<Psi-Jack>	naptr: Heh. I use my statusbar. :p
<quantum-x>	reisio: yeah :/ It's a pickled python file. I was debugging it, and accidently deleted the source file. I had a cat output of it in the console. And that's all :)
<baldfat>	zorak8: that #slackware beign invite only speaks volume on it's community
<reisio>	quantum-x: oh, no doubt #python is familiar with that problem
<reisio>	you can parse man ascii and loop through it easily enough, though
<quantum-x>	man ascii
<naptr>	Psi-Jack: i'm using it through puTTY. term setting is my biggest issue.
<quantum-x>	ugh..
<Psi-Jack>	naptr: Well, putty sucks. So, there you have it. :p
<zorak8>	baldfat: i was in the wrong channel
<naptr>	Psi-Jack: please, recommend something else?
<baldfat>	miyalys: They are just different labels
<Psi-Jack>	naptr: ssh. :)
<naptr>	Psi-Jack: well, from win7.
<naptr>	hmm, could go cygwin :/
<Psi-Jack>	naptr: cygwin sucks.
<baldfat>	naptr: Have you tried mobaxterm
<naptr>	Psi-Jack: agreed.
<quantum-x>	mobaxterm is great
<reisio>	well, windows sucks
<quantum-x>	very, very solid.
<reisio>	cygwin is great
<miyalys>	partuuid and partlabel are related only to gpt, and they are associated with partitions rather than filesystems. Is that right? Is a label associated with a file system or a partition?
<naptr>	baldfat: not yet. i only have putty. thank you for another name.
<Psi-Jack>	naptr: I don't use Windows, so really couldn't help anyway. :)
<naptr>	Psi-Jack: meh, it's a job thing :/
<Psi-Jack>	naptr: I use Linux and OS X (work computer).
<quantum-x>	reisio: modexterm has cygwin built into it, so you don't have to install it and fugly up your system
<reisio>	fugly?
<baldfat>	naptr: mobaxterm has a x server for x forwarding which is amazing
<reisio>	you pick a dir and cygwin installs into it
<Psi-Jack>	naptr: If I worked for a company that required me to use Windows, I won't work for them. Period.
<reisio>	also windows is ununfugliable
<MrElendig>	miyalys: label is fs, partlabel is partition
<quantum-x>	well, not here to debate that
<quantum-x>	mobaxterm == good
<reisio>	:p
<naptr>	baldfat: now, if i can just upgrade that server to include a better NIC than 10/100 the x server would be useful.
<baldfat>	naptr: My lord how old is that thing?
<naptr>	baldfat: that's the funny part. it's not *that* old, but, i know. right?
<naptr>	who puts 10/100 onboard these days.
<baldfat>	naptr: Are you sure it is 10/100 than?
<naptr>	yes =(
<naptr>	media: Ethernet autoselect (100baseTX <full-duplex>)

<miyalys>	MrElendig: Okay, thanks! What's the difference between id and uuid? Is ID only unique within a disk?

<Fluent>	When you connect, ssh will look at the ~/.profile of blah@host and execute anything in there
<baxx>	Fluent: ah cool, i'll try that now thanks :)
<SimonB__>	ok so why would the result to "/usr/bin/du -sL /path/to/dir|cut -w -f1" double if I ran it from a cron script as opposed to from the command line, or in fact running the script cron runs from the users shell gets the correct non-doubled results too. It's only when cron runs the command the results seem to double.
<Texan>	quick question: i have a makefile, and im trying to use an alias inside of it. i tried adding 'shopt -s expand_aliases' inside of my .bashrc, but that didnt do the trick. what am i missing?
<inode33>	Are you serious?
<inode33>	I think he knows better than to rm the root of some computer at the company he works for
<baxx>	Fluent: I've just put a line in .profile as     `~/scriptToRun.sh`
<Psi-Jack>	Immaterial
<Fluent>	It would be fun to do that
<Psi-Jack>	Destructive commands are NOT funny, ever, and always an instant-bannable offense.
<avocado>	lol
<jelly>	instant banana what?
<avocado>	rm -rf / is not destructive under the vast majority of linux oses
<avocado>	it errors out
<hydraglyph>	Who determines what commands are destructive?
<Psi-Jack>	avocado: It doesn't matter.
<Fluent>	It is destructive
<Fluent>	But only if it succeeds
<inode33>	Meh
<rumpel>	with great power comes great responsibility
<baxx>	isn't that command a really bad joke, like huh huh huh luk at me ima funy
<avocado>	sounds like somebody has a case of the mondays
<inode33>	s/responsibility/insanity/

<Fluent>	Problem solved
*	ChanServ gives channel operator status to WildPikachu
*	WildPikachu sets quiet on $a:avocado
*	WildPikachu removes channel operator status from WildPikachu
<Psi-Jack>	Ahh there we go.
<jelly>	Fluent: insufficent obfuscation
<Psi-Jack>	WildPikachu: limbo too.
<Fluent>	You right
<Fluent>	But, in the time it took me to do that
<Fluent>	Not too bad
<inode33>	I wonder what all that hexcode says.

<triceratux>	all your escape colon q bang enter are belong to us :)

<jelly>	WildPikachu: Fluent's one is the worst, probably.  I give it 1.2 rm-rfslashes.
<Fluent>	Kek
<inode33>	so now rming the root directory is a rating system?
<Psi-Jack>	WildPikachu: Yeah, Fluent's basically runs shred on /dev/sd*
<Psi-Jack>	:p
<jelly>	Fluent: but it appears your obfu has saved you from +q, so... it is very effective!

<jelly>	gosh darn
<inode33>	Fluent = b&
<Psi-Jack>	Heh
<reisio>	probably got a +q just for the spam aspect :p
<Psi-Jack>	jelly: Sometimes, you just gotta translate it. :D
<Texan>	quick question: i have a makefile, and im trying to use an alias inside of it. i tried adding 'shopt -s expand_aliases' inside of my .bashrc, but that didnt do the trick. what am i missing?
<Psi-Jack>	WildPikachu: Thank you.
<WildPikachu>	limbo, Fluent, you both have a 1 day +q in this channel, please take the time to read over the channel rules and guidelines, destructive commands are not funny
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: So found a 'problem' with doing what I want to do with crashplan.. hehe
<Psi-Jack>	heh, oh?
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: for some reason the 'command' port aka port 4242 won't bind on my VPS for some reason
<Dominian>	and nothing in the logs
<Psi-Jack>	Hmmm
<Dominian>	unless...
<Dominian>	Nope the cnetral backup thinks it needs to be 4242
<Psi-Jack>	Man, haveing a little minpin dog sitting in your lap, resting head on wrist, makes for such a hard time typing. LOL
<Dominian>	hehe
<MrDSmith>	Hi all. Bit of a problem. I've accidentally created a directory called '--recursive' and was wondering how to delete it. I'm sure it's simple but it's beyond me.
<MrDSmith>	Does anyone know how to remove it?
<inode33>	MrDSmith: You can escape the '-' symbols with backslash
<inode33>	iirc
<MrDSmith>	doh!
<MrDSmith>	Thanks for your help
<inode33>	np
<inode33>	MrDSmith: I've created several directories by accident with odd names like '.' '$' unicode chinese characters,etc :)
<pid1>	You can also back up a directory, if you have a bunch of characters.
<baldfat>	MrDSmith: I use ranger as a file manager and forget these old commands :)
<pid1>	cd .. and rm -r Documents/%@#$%junk
<Psi-Jack>	There we go.. Now I finally have my tmux and vim stuff on all my desktops/laptops again.
<amigoo89>	Hey guys, I don't get new entries in my mail.log file, I tried to restart my syslog, I restarted postfix/dovecot and rebooted my system. No result, I don't see new entries in my log files. What can I do?
<baldfat>	amigoo89: We dont have enough information. Distro would help
<frib>	I want to buy a brother printer, compatibility of which openprinting.org says nothing for linux, brother site says linux is supported.  is it safe to assume? thanks
<MrDSmith>	Awesome. Thanks for your help everyone!
<inode33>	If I want a Linux printer, I just read the amazon reviews
<SimonB__>	and the answer to my problem was du was complied with a blocksize of 512
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: found the problem
<SimonB__>	using -k fixed it
<Psi-Jack>	Dominian: Some firewall?
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: apparently it needs a /tmp directory without the noexec option
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: my /tmp is a loopmounted iso file with noexec enabled :
<Dominian>	:)
<amigoo89>	edit: nvm, deleted files, rebooted and now work again, thanks though!
<Psi-Jack>	Heh ohhhh
<Psi-Jack>	Dominian: Possibly configurable to change the tmp dir it uses.
<Psi-Jack>	IIRC
<baxx>	how do I logout of ssh via a script? At the moment I'm left in the session.
<inode33>	frib: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsPrinters Ubuntu Printer Compatibility Reports :)
<triceratux>	Texan: all sorts of stuff. dont use aliases. write a script
<triceratux>	oops
<baldfat>	baxx: You ont he server?
<Psi-Jack>	baxx: Kill the pid.
<baxx>	baldfat: running the script from local - it leaves me logged into the server though
<baxx>	i coudld just CTRL-d i guess
<socialblogsite>	does anyone use MAMP pro to let others view your local websites from a remote computer?
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: yeah you can change it
<frib>	inode33, that list is of supported devices but not all supported devices, right?
<inode33>	frib: Probably not, it's just a report of how the printers worked with Ubuntu
<inode33>	If you want to know about a specific printer that isn't there you'll have to do some research
<baldfat>	baxx: ./script.sh && exit
<frib>	inode33, so the fact that brother says linux is supported is relevant somehwat/not at all?
<inode33>	I don't know how much your brother knows, frib. Maybe he has done the research. Of course worst case scenario, you have to return the printer and buy a different one.
<frib>	inode33, the brand "brother"'s website
<baldfat>	baxx: If it exits to soon (happens sometimes) ssh foohost 'sleep 60 &' exits after one minute
<frib>	i.e. brother.com
<baxx>	cheers baldfat , anyway to bake that into the script?
<inode33>	frib:  Oh, I never heard of that. When I want to check compatibility with a printer I just plug it in with usb and maybe download some drivers from the manufacturer's website.
<baldfat>	baxx: Yes but I am lazy and know that if I run the script with && exit it exits
<inode33>	frib: What printer is it?
<baxx>	I need to enter my password in the server script anyway at the moment as it backs something up from /var as a part of it baldfat
<frib>	inode33, i'm going to assume its safe then
<baxx>	baldfat: ha fair :)
<frib>	inode33, HL-L2340DW (brother)
<baldfat>	baxx: Plus I kind of like to do this explised in terms of actions so back ground scripts go with & and exit with && exit and out put has nothing
<baldfat>	baxx: password? You don't use shared keys?
<baxx>	baldfat: I have ssh keys, but it needs sudo to copy to and from /var
<baxx>	so it asks me for sudo baldfat
<inode33>	frib: Just looking at it they offer Linux drivers on the website :)
<frib>	yea
<inode33>	frib: The first amazon review also said it worked for him.
<frib>	inode33, what do you think of it?
<inode33>	Go for it.
<baldfat>	baxx: If it is for logs I just have a rsync on my box that copies the logs I need into user space and than copy those (Hack)
<Dominian>	Psi-Jack: yeah that didn't work hmm...
<baldfat>	baxx: As a genreal rule I never want to do anything with sudo over ssh in a script
<inode33>	frib:  You might need to fiddle with it, but lots of things on Linux desktops are fiddly.
<frib>	inode33, i mean do you think it's a good printer?
<baldfat>	baxx: Actually I disable sudo on my servers even if they are ubunut
<inode33>	frib: Oh, Well I haven't used enough printers to have an opinion on that particular model.
<baxx>	baldfat: its for pushing a git repo from local to the server ~ then to var from there... it's probably really convoluted
<inode33>	frib: I've never had a problem with HP printers though.
<baxx>	wasn't sure how else to do it tbh! baldfat
<baldfat>	baxx: well I am trying to figure out why your doing git to /var  so the hacking way is to git to a name spaced folder ~/bin for example than have a server script that rsync to var that watches the folder/ As a rule alsays do the least from outside going into the server
<baldfat>	Printers have come SUCH a long way int he past 5 years! 10 years ago it requiered the sacrifice of your only child to get anying to work that wasn't HP for the most part
<baxx>	baldfat: this might make it more clear http://vpaste.net/tdeHG
<baxx>	baldfat: * clearer
<inode33>	Now I want to write a smartphone application in lolcode.
<inode33>	heh
<inode33>	Goodbye
<baldfat>	baxx: Well that is a HUGE hack. I am immpressed I thought I was the only one that did things with 8 to many steps :)
<baldfat>	baxx: http://toroid.org/ams/git-website-howto
<baxx>	baldfat: ha ha is it... i was thinking there must be a better way, but then i was also thinking that this would work and it did :P
<baldfat>	baxx: Yeah I usually do it the same way you did and than refine it a few times and make a well polished turd when I am done that works and is stable
<baxx>	baldfat: thanks for the link I'll check it out now!
<baldfat>	baxx: It isn't the best one but it was the first for my google search :)
<baxx>	baldfat: what were the key words? git local html site blah?
<baldfat>	baxx: using git for website development
<baxx>	baldfat: makes sense
<baldfat>	baxx: Congrast we killed the conversations on the channel
<Psi-Jack>	And to top if off, YOU KILLED KENNY!
<squirrel>	i'm trying to copy a file using scp to ~/foo which is a link to a folder of another user, to which i have write access through the groups. i get access denied error. copying file to ~ and then doing $ cp file foo works just fine. why doesn't scp work like that?
<Psi-Jack>	squirrel: What's your full scp command?
<Psi-Jack>	Also remember, ~ is translated by bash /BEFORE/ executed.
<squirrel>	Psi-Jack: i'm actually using winscp, but it traslates the links properly and i can read files from ~/foo just fine
<Psi-Jack>	In that case. Can't help you.
<Psi-Jack>	This is obviously not a Linux issue.

<DarkElement>	What do i need to use with wget to download all .txt files to one file?
<zorak8>	why the conection to the ubuntu servers for a system upgrade is so slow? i can download at 1000KB/s, but to the upgrades the best i get is 20KB/s
<souuell>	DarkElement: from a website?

<logan0405>	what happens if i use the dd command w/o using fallocate first? i just did that by accident.
<ayecee>	the file may not be contiguous, but probably will be anyways unless your filesystem is nearly full.
<ayecee>	hmm. no, that's not it either.
<ayecee>	logan0405: should make no difference.
<kurahaupo_>	it's not like fallocate guarantees contiguity anyway
<logan0405>	really? was super tired and fell asleep after using dd command. woke up my xfce4 session being messed up and it saying I had no room on disk
<logan0405>	but I deleted the img file I created (8gb on 328gb disk) and I have space now
<ayecee>	how do you normally use fallocate?
<logan0405>	I'm a total newbie to it just trying to figure out how to clone an sd card
<ayecee>	i haven't used fallocate to create a file i intend to dd over, so i'm not sure how you'd use that.
<logan0405>	ok. so given a drive has more free space than my sd card, dd if=sd of=the other drive will work fine and not cause glitches? I thought it might cause some sort of data corruption if the 2 drives are not the same filesystem type maybe
<ayecee>	shouldn't
<logan0405>	where should i read up on this i want to understand it
<ayecee>	understand what?
<ayecee>	if you have a 5L bucket, and a 10L bucket, and you pour the 5L into the 10L bucket, the 10L bucket won't overflow
<hydraglyph>	dd takes the input from one file and puts it in another. When you use dd to copy the contents of a block device to a file on a filesystem, any filesystem on the block device will now be copied into the file that's on the recipient filesystem
<annihilannic>	logan0405: they are filesytems... the whole reason they exist is to organise data in a useful way.  of course they shouldn't corrupt it.
<kurahaupo_>	fallocate just asks the filesystem to make a zero-filled non-sparse file, which you overwrite with the dd image, so the dd can't stop for out-of-space part way through
