[21:27] <davecheney> mwhudson: do arm put "superceeded" on the background of every page unconditionally
[21:28] <davecheney> or are there actually some pages they have not yet depricated ?
[21:28] <mwhudson> davecheney: heh
[21:28] <mwhudson> davecheney: only the pages that have been around long enough to be found by google, i think
[21:28] <mwhudson> there will be a version that does not have superceded written on
[21:28] <mwhudson> but it can be pretty hard to find
