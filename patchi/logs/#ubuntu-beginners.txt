[00:53] <pedro3005> jdeloach, nvidia plays nicer with linux
[00:54] <Phrea> hmm, my gf has a pc that uses Karmic, it used to be able to go online via the onboard NIC, but all the sudden it doesnt anymore...
[00:55] <pedro3005> Phrea, oh noes!
[00:55] <Phrea> I told her to reboot the system while the UTP is connected
[00:55] <jdeloach> yeah. too bad i didn't know that two years ago when i bought my computer :( would have gotten Nvidia
[00:55] <Phrea> both NIC and UTP cable are fully working
[00:57] <pedro3005> Phrea, the card is detected?
[00:57] <Phrea> yes
[00:57] <Phrea> more news later ;)
[00:58] <nhandler> As a heads up, ubuntulog is now in this channel. Public logs will be available on irclogs.ubuntu.com now
=== nhandler changed the topic of #ubuntu-beginners to: Please do not wait to ask questions, simply ask! If anyone knows the answer, they will most likely reply. || Welcome to the Ubuntu Beginners Team support channel. || Please note, public logs of this channel are available on irclogs.ubuntu.com
[00:58] <Phrea> oh no..
[00:58] <pedro3005> I guess I can't plot my murders here now
[00:58] <Phrea> I HATE IRC logs...
[00:59] <Phrea> pedro3005: we now have to be careful indeed
[00:59] <Phrea> ;)
[01:01] <pedro3005> lukjad86, i'm still out to get you, know that
[01:03] <Phrea> dude, shhht, that just got posted on the irclogs man !
[01:04] <Phrea> oh, I just clicked, and it seems that everything ever posted here has already been logged...
[01:04] <Phrea> Excuse me if I sign off.
[01:05] <pedro3005> oh cool
[01:05] <pedro3005> i can track myself down
[01:05] <pedro3005> let's see, 2008
[01:06] <pedro3005> wait, no
[01:06] <pedro3005> Phrea, it's general ubuntu logs, not this channel
[01:07] <Phrea> I noticed :)
[01:07] <Phrea> that's why I stfu'ed
[01:07] <pedro3005> you made me believe for a second I could re-live a part of my life!
[01:07] <pedro3005> :P
[01:07] <Phrea> well, you can
[01:07] <pedro3005> Phrea, shit, http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2010/03/04/%23ubuntu-beginners.txt
[01:08] <Phrea> indeed, sir
[01:08] <Phrea> it seems a bit chaotic
[01:08] <Phrea> I'd devise them in channels, rather than year/month/date
[01:08] <Phrea> but that's just me
[01:09] <pedro3005> yeah
[01:09] <pedro3005> truth is
[01:09] <pedro3005> you gotta reach a whole new level of boredom to go through that stuff
[01:09] <pedro3005> so probably it'll go unread
[01:09] <Phrea> indeed
[01:09] <Phrea> that's why I would devise them via channels
[01:10] <Phrea> to save some boredom time
[01:20] <coldfire> Ive rebooted several times and gnome is still locking up. The only thing i did before this happened is install some AV programs. What should i do? Reinstall ubuntu?

[02:32] <mathay> Quickard: kind of that your keyboard isn't responding?
[02:32] <mathay> *kind of like
[02:33] <mathay> IE, you can still move your mouse around and what not, right?
[02:34] <Quickard> yes
[02:34] <Quickard> I can move the mouse, I can see the accessability window
[02:35] <Quickard> and when I hit the power button the shutdown window pops up, then it tells me that the desktop is not responding
[02:39] <Quickard> when I go to shutdown it says that the gnome desktop is not responding

[07:07] <wojox> Do I just register my nickname here with: /msg nickserv register
[07:09] <elfy> and a e-mail address
[07:09] <elfy> eg /msg NickServ REGISTER bar foo@bar.com
[07:09] <wojox> what about the password?
[07:10] <elfy> Syntax: REGISTER <password> <email-address>
[07:10] <wojox> Will it be seen or is it not ipportant
[07:10] <elfy> it would be seen if you made a mistake and it was read as text - I usually do stuff like that in the server window xchat gives me
[07:12] <wojox> Thanks elfy
[07:12] <elfy> welcome :)

[15:59] <tdn> I have a machine with two network adapters: an ethernet adapter and a wireless adapter. How can I turn the wireless adapter into an access point?
[16:05] <nigelb> tdn: you're looking for internet connection sharing?
[16:06] <tdn> nigelb, I want to use this machine as access point to set up wireless connection.
[16:06] <nigelb> tdn: does this help you? http://doctormo.ubuntu-ma.us/2009/12/06/ubuntus-internet-connection-sharing/
[16:06] <tdn> nigelb, rt73usb/Qcom <- This is my wlan card.
[16:07] <tdn> nigelb, no. I only have ssh access to the box.
[16:07] <tdn> At the moment.
[16:07] <nigelb> oh
[16:07] <tdn> If I write iwconfig wlan0 mode Master, I get an error: Error for wireless request "Set Mode" (8B06) :     SET failed on device wlan0 ; Invalid argument.
[16:08] <nigelb> tdn: try this forum post then http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=91370
