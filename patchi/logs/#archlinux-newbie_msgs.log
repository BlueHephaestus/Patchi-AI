<darkelement>	how can i connect to the internet with my arch linux on vmware
<darkelement>	i have checked ip link and lspci and i know that i have a wireless card ready
<halosghost>	what are you using to connect to the wifi?
<darkelement>	i'm not able to connect to the wifi
<darkelement>	as far as i can tell
<darkelement>	i was unable to use pacman to install programs,however
<mrelendig>	what card?
<darkelement>	ip link returns (1)lo and (2) eno16777736
<darkelement>	however none of the iwconfig, ipconfig commands are installed
<mrelendig>	ipconfig is not a gnu/linux thing
<darkelement>	ifconfig
<halosghost>	ifconfig is deprecated
<mrelendig>	ifconfig was deprecated over a decade ago
<darkelement>	ok what do i do then
<mrelendig>	connect the wired network since you forgot to install the wifi tools
<mrelendig>	or boot the install image again, set up network, chroot in, install what you need
<darkelement>	how can i connect to the wired network?
<darkelement>	with ethernet, or commands you mean
<darkelement>	gonna assume ethernet, in which case i will connect when home
<mrelendig>	dhcpcd eno1
<halosghost>	<tab>
>nickserv<	identify ****
<darkelement>	mrelendig, back at home, however even with a wired connection im not able to install with pacman because of connection failure
<fsckd>	darkelement: does host work?
<darkelement>	command not found
<darkelement>	for "host"
<fsckd>	i mean in the host
<fsckd>	does the host's network work?
<darkelement>	yea
<fsckd>	so just in vmware?
<darkelement>	yep, just with archlinux as well, i am able to connect with my ubuntu vm
<fsckd>	ok, i have never used vmware with linux
<fsckd>	from arch can you ping 8.8.8.8 ?
<kyusaki_>	good morning everyone
<sniper338>	gud afternoon :)
<gehidore>	ya
<colbyftp>	i want to install yaurt, but need to install package-query 1st
<colbyftp>	use wget not installed
<colbyftp>	sudo pacman -s wget databse for wget does not exist
<colbyftp>	is there another way from base to download wget
<colbyftp>	everytime i think i resolve an issue another presents itself :)...am i understading this right, to use makepkg. i hould set up a tmp folder somewnere for my builds, and cp then modify the pkdest variable to point the new temp dir i set up
<namarrgon>	what are you trying to do? just build an aur/abs package?
<colbyftp>	install package-query, i just did a fresh install and added basic xfce and sound now i want to install yauoart
<colbyftp>	plus i want to do most through termianl so i will learn more
<namarrgon>	get the tarball from the aur, extract it to a build-directory. then look through the pkgbuild and .install to make sure they aren't doing anything stupid.
<namarrgon>	then build/install with makepkg.
<colbyftp>	makepkg returns ==> error: pkgbuild does not exist.
<namarrgon>	you have to run makepkg in the directory with the pkgbuild.
<namarrgon>	go through the makepkg page on the wiki, just in case i forgot to mention something.
<colbyftp>	i think i may have resolved, i found a install in the tar:-
<colbyftp>	 briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
<colbyftp>	configure, build, and install this package.
<namarrgon>	yup
<colbyftp>	sry:)
<namarrgon>	also look for source=, it should download from a legitimate source.
<colbyftp>	np thanks
<colbyftp>	so now to download and install octopi, see if i have learnt anything :)
<colbyftp>	ya ever stare at the makepkg text and try to make pictures
<nawarch>	buenos dias tengo una pregunta
<nawarch>	resulta que al actualizar mi arch quedo con el ultimo kernel pero ahora no tengo conexion a wifi, nisiquiera me aparece la interface he usado iwconfig para ver las interfaces
<namarrgon>	tsk, no patience
<colbyftp>	anyone know how i could app spotify to xfce systray
<fsckd>	this perhaps? https://community.spotify.com/t5/help-desktop-linux-mac-and/what-happened-to-quot-minimize-to-tray-quot-option/td-p/1042139
<phrik>	title: what happened to "minimize to tray" option ?? - the spotify community (at community.spotify.com)
<colbyftp>	ah that explains it. thanks
<colbyftp>	well that means i will install https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mopidy-spotify/
<phrik>	title: aur (en) - mopidy-spotify (at aur.archlinux.org)
<colbyftp>	sry guys, decided to use yaourt, but i keep getting unable to open file: /usr/local/etc/pacman.conf
<colbyftp>	on the net it say to edit /etc/profile and put /usr/bin 1st in the path line but still no dif
<namarrgon>	how did you install yaourt?
<colbyftp>	i can't remember tbh
<colbyftp>	should i remove and reinstall
<colbyftp>	r create a syslink ...
<fsckd>	create a symlink? why?
<fsckd>	if i had to guess, you installed something outside of pacman. that's a no no.
<colbyftp>	so when it goes looking in the wrong dir it will link over to the right file?? noob here just guessing
<colbyftp>	anything i have installed has been either pacman or direct from aur using makepkg
<fsckd>	yaourt shouldn't be looking in /usr/local
<colbyftp>	except the 'query' dependant for yaourt which i insalled using .config/make/make install
<fsckd>	ahh there you go
<fsckd>	that's why you're have that problem. you installed package-query outside of pacman
<colbyftp>	ahh ok
<fsckd>	not using pacman makes things harder as you have to do things by hand. :/
<colbyftp>	brand new so was trying to do everything manually oops any idea how i shoud correct
<fsckd>	you have to find the files, remove them, then install package-query with makepkg+pacman
<colbyftp>	this is what i do now, let me know if i am doing it right
<colbyftp>	wget file from aur
<colbyftp>	extract cd into dir   makepkg -si
<colbyftp>	thts it
<fsckd>	that's the correct way
<colbyftp>	ok just fecked up right at the start
<fsckd>	hehe, no worries. better to learn this lesson on something simple. i once installed xen outside the package manager. never again. ><
<colbyftp>	lol i can imagine
<fsckd>	most likely the files are dumped under /usr/local. so shouldn't be hard to find its stuff.
<fsckd>	don't remove everything from /usr/local. only remove the package-query stuff
<colbyftp>	../usr/local/bin has package-query, no where esle in local does
<fsckd>	one moment
<colbyftp>	reinstall package-query using empty --prefix ./configure --prefix=
<fsckd>	don't
<colbyftp>	somwone has shared that
<colbyftp>	i wont
<fsckd>	ahh ok
<fsckd>	ok i have a list of files
<colbyftp>	cool thank you for helping me
<fsckd>	(i built and "installed" it, to under /tmp like i was packaging)
<fsckd>	only two files i think
<colbyftp>	lets hope so
<fsckd>	/usr/local/bin/package-query
<fsckd>	/usr/local/share/man/man8/package-query.8
<darkelement>	so guys when you install arch on vmware using an iso, do you need to download any network stuff? i can't connect.
<colbyftp>	try changing virtual box settings to bridged
<namarrgon>	darkelement: no, 'base' has all you need for dhcp/static
<fsckd>	colbyftp: also if you can, please share the output of `tree /usr/local` in a pastebin service
<colbyftp>	in order bin etc games lib man sbin share src
<colbyftp>	ah ok
<colbyftp>	tree a command
<darkelement>	namarrgon, i can't download anything with pacman, and i believe i installed base. it is giving unable to connect errors, any ideas?
<colbyftp>	darkelement: change vb settings to bridged under network
<namarrgon>	darkelement: what gives your errors?
<namarrgon>	pacstrap?
<colbyftp>	fsckd: http://pastebin.com/rdgmwcvy
<phrik>	title: [colbyf@localhost local]$ tree /usr/local /usr/local |-- bin |-- etc |-- gam - pastebin.com (at pastebin.com)
<darkelement>	colbyftp: ahh, thats right
<darkelement>	namarrgon: one sec
<fsckd>	colbyftp: looks like it is all gone :)
<fsckd>	colbyftp: install package-query like normal
<colbyftp>	fsckd: i changed /etc/profile around, shoudl i change it back 1st
<fsckd>	what changes did you make?
<colbyftp>	just the path, changed the order thats all
<colbyftp>	path="/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin"
<fsckd>	it might not matter. you can change it back if you'd like, or keep it
<colbyftp>	i think sbin was 1st and /usr/vin was last
<fsckd>	yeah, mine has /usr/bin last
<fsckd>	and sbin first
<colbyftp>	cool, changed back to normal then
<fsckd>	probably should have stuff under local first
<colbyftp>	ok installed again just have to remember what i was doing lol
<fsckd>	hehe
<colbyftp>	wooohoooo thankyou :) its make it past that error :)
<fsckd>	yay, congrats. and you are welcome. :)
<colbyftp>	what does enter no of packages to be installed mean?
<colbyftp>	options 1 2 3
<colbyftp>	got it, it was difficult to make sense of when only 1 package appeared
<swift110_>	hey
<meskarune>	hai
<darkelement>	back guys, and making it a bridge network did not solve the issue
<darkelement>	i still cannot resolve host.
<fsckd>	darkelement: can you ping 8.8.8.8?
<darkelement>	unreachable
<namarrgon>	have you set up your network?
<gehidore>	doh bad up arrow
<gehidore>	fsckd: are you on 8.8.8.8 for your dns?
<angrysteve>	8.8.8.8 is evil!
<darkelement>	friend remote connected and it's working alright now, ty!
<namarrgon>	were you told what to do?
<darkelement>	just needed to do dhcpcd
<namarrgon>	just 'dhcpcd'?

<namarrgon>	you have to enable the service to make it persist across reboots

<spechter>	is there a way to force a command to split his output to several lines ?
<spechter>	i'm trying to startx, but it fails and he puts all error in just one line which doen't fit my screen
<spechter>	i've already read the log, but fixing errors with missing fonts didn't help
<cheese>	did it give you an error number?
<spechter>	i don't think so
<spechter>	i will check after a quick restart
<spechter>	no, it didn't give me a error number
<spechter>	and running mkfontdir in the given directory fixed it so far
<spechter>	there is one warning left about opening acpi failed for a missing directory
<cheese>	well sounds like you know more than me.
<cheese>	i just had a problem with xorg giving me error 1
<cheese>	reinstalled the video driver and it worked
<spechter>	ok, i will try that
<cheese>	not sure i would listen to me. i dont even know if is working. i run startx and i get a black screen. i run startx 'openbox sessions' and get a black screen
<cheese>	having trouble finding the file
<fsckd>	probably you didn't make it. don't worry, you can make it now. :)
<fsckd>	there is this https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xinitrc
<phrik>	title: xinitrc - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<tigrmesh>	ls -l .*rc*
<cheese>	thanks. let me give it shot
<cheese>	not sure if im doing this right. startx run /etc/x11/xinit/xinitrc,  gives me a black screen
<fsckd>	the default xinitrc starts twm and xterm. you need the packages for both of those installed
<cheese>	ahhh...  i see....
<cheese>	so if i decide to skip those andn
<fsckd>	make your own ~/.xinitrc
<cheese>	and just run open box would there be problem
<fsckd>	no problem. but you have to make your own xinitrc

<blahdodo>	anybody have any ideas how to stop dropped packets in kvm guest - tried "sudo ethtool -k eth0 tx off sg off tso off ufo off gso off gro off" no joy
<tigrmesh>	cheese, the other thing pacman will do for you is show you what's installed.  as much as possible, package everything and install it with your package manager
<tigrmesh>	so when you find something awesome that depends on a certain version of a package, you can see whether it's installed
<spechter>	http://fpaste.org/220289

<spechter>	there is my most recent log
<fsckd>	spechter: no errors, how are you starting it?
<cheese>	so (+ti pacman -ss openbox
<cheese>	pacman -ss openbox doesnt seem to work
<cheese>	something about config file ..... mirriorlist..... core not recognized
<fsckd>	cheese: sorry, not ss as that searches, just s by itself
<fsckd>	see: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman#installing_packages
<phrik>	title: pacman - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<cheese>	ok that makes more sense. ive done that. i thought it was another command or something. i have like 0 experience in the command line. its taken me a week to get this to boot up.
<fsckd>	ahh, if i may ask, what did you use before?
<cheese>	osx and windows
<fsckd>	oh i see. osx is technically unix but one can go without ever using the command line
<cheese>	yea... that was. me just point and click
<fsckd>	what made you chose arch?
<fsckd>	choose*
<cheese>	after upgrading to yosemite my computer got even slower. im over all the crap they bundle with the os. i like the idea of arch keeping it simple and that you only install what you want. plus i thought building it from the ground up would be a good learning experience
<fsckd>	yeah, it can be a good learning experience. you've dived in. :)
<fsckd>	arch isn't hard if one perseveres and tried to learn. it isn't intended for beginners but it isn't impossible for beginners.
<cheese>	the more i play with it the more i'll understand and the easier it will get.
<cheese>	plus there is so much info out there for it.
<cheese>	and support
<fsckd>	hehe, i'm told the wiki is the best. when i started using arch, gentoo's wiki was the best.
<cheese>	the wiki is till pretty heavy right now but its definitely helpful
<cheese>	i get an error during xorg-config. the log says i have a kernel claiming my video card. lsmod shows video i915, apple_gmux.... is this why im still getting a black screen?
<cheese>	i followed the wiki and download the 340.xx when initially trying to set up xorg
<manish>	hi! i'm having trouble running gnome terminal, can anybody help me out ?

<colbyftp>	hey folks, have a combi bluetooth/wifi card on my hp laptop. the wifi works ok, but not bluetooth, when using ubuntu i was able to download drivers and kernel update for it. can i do this in arch...
<colbyftp>	rtl8723be  <<<< is the name of the device
<fsckd>	there might be something in the aur

<phrik>	title: bluetooth not working / newbie corner / arch linux forums (at bbs.archlinux.org)
<tigrmesh>	what do you use the bluetooth for?
<colbyftp>	i use it for my beats pill
<spechter1>	tigrmesh yes, even if it seems like i come closer to a soultion
<spechter1>	right now it looks like i'm just missing some fonts for a config file for bspwm i got from github
<spechter1>	but i'm not sure how to read those lines
<spechter1>	urxvt*font: -*-neep-medium-r-semicondensed-*-11-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
<mrelendig>	use xft instead
<mrelendig>	imo
<mrelendig>	asuming it is a ttf/otf font
<spechter1>	so replacing urxvt*font with urxvt*xft ?
<fsckd>	example from mine: urxvt.font: xft:droid sans mono dotted:bold:size=9
<fsckd>	you would keep urxvt*font and replace the right side
<spechter1>	ok, i will try it
<spechter1>	btw when i startx it doesn't crahs immediately but shows an xsessin
<spechter1>	but the background i set with hsetroot in my .xinitrc is not shown
<fsckd>	what de or wm?
<spechter1>	and none of my sxhkd shortcuts is working
<spechter1>	bspwm
<spechter1>	both bspwm and sxhkd are installed from the official repository if i remember correctly
<mrelendig>	post your xinitrc
<spechter1>	one moment
<mrelendig>	use bpaste.net or similar
<mrelendig>	not pastebin.com
<spechter1>	it's on fpaste.org

<phrik>	title: #220420 • fedora project pastebin (at fpaste.org)
<spechter1>	shall i upload my .xressources aswell ?
<spechter1>	there are all those fonts for urxvt defined
<spechter1>	in my panel config i found some declarations of fonts
<spechter1>	and the comment above says xft is not supported yet
<spechter1>	so how is this sytax i've posted before called ?
<spechter1>	maybe it will work if i modify this or atleast understand it
<mrelendig>	xfontsel
<mrelendig>	but if your panel doesn't support xft then get a less crappy panel
<mrelendig>	since it is not 1982 anymore
<spechter>	well, for now i've loaded my saved config files
<spechter>	i wlll give it a try in the upcoming week and add it module by module
<tigrmesh>	mrelendig!  total extended memory: 1982 mb.  would you set the uma frame buffer size to 64 mb or 128 ?
<tigrmesh>	mrelendig, you personally.  supports 32mb too, but that causes bad flicker
<darkelement>	hey guys how can i access the guest os with my archlinux vm? i am trying to download vmware tools for it.
<fsckd>	access how?
<darkelement>	i accessed it.
<darkelement>	anyone know how to install vmblock?
<darkelement>	i can't run vmware-user without it.
<mrelendig>	tigrmesh: as high as possible probably
<tigrmesh>	ok
<tigrmesh>	thanks
<namarrgon>	darkelement: are you using the open-vm-tools package?
<darkelement>	yea it shouldbe that
<namarrgon>	why do you need vmblock then?
<darkelement>	so i can run vmware-user
<darkelement>	and i need to run that to change my resolution.
<namarrgon>	no, vmblock has nothing to do with the resolution
<mrelendig>	tigrmesh: if running x etc
<darkelement>	well i can't run vmware-user without it.
<namarrgon>	you only needed it for d&d support but it was replaced by a fuse module
<darkelement>	how can i install vmblock
<namarrgon>	you can't
<darkelement>	what do i do instae
<namarrgon>	what error do you get?
<darkelement>	instead.
<darkelement>	it's telling me that /proc/fs/vmblock/dev is unable to be accessed, and that is because it's not there
<namarrgon>	how are you starting it?
<darkelement>	test
<darkelement>	./usr/bin/vmware-user and vmware-user both give this.
<darkelement>	sorry
<darkelement>	forgot about "/"
<namarrgon>	where did you get 'vmware-user' from?
<namarrgon>	open-vm-tools doesn't contain it
<darkelement>	please just help me get over this problem
<namarrgon>	that's what i'm trying to do
<darkelement>	i'm trying to set up vmware tools, and i have to run that command in order to change resolution.
<namarrgon>	have you enabled and started the service as the wiki said?
<darkelement>	enabled and started vmware tools? yes i believe it is running
<namarrgon>	and the one?
<namarrgon>	*the other
<darkelement>	the other what
<namarrgon>	service

<namarrgon>	mod+return or mod+shift+return, don't remember the default
<namarrgon>	it should be in config.h and config.h.mk
<darkelement>	mod being alt
<darkelement>	right?
<namarrgon>	was that a question?
<namarrgon>	yes, alt
<darkelement>	i ask because that doesnt' work, i've tried it.
<darkelement>	:p
<namarrgon>	do you have the terminal installed?
<darkelement>	yea

<namarrgon>	that's the default, i don't know which version you are using
<namarrgon>	and the default terminal is 'st'
<namarrgon>	you might want to switch to a wm with a more accessible config
<halosghost>	lol
<halosghost>	it's true dwm takes a bit of doing to understand the config

<darkelement>	why does "st" not work....:*(

<typh00nz>	ll bring issues
<typh00nz>	but i havent noticed yet
<namarrgon>	if at all it'll be smaller issues
<typh00nz>	do you recommend using ssd for archlinux?
<typh00nz>	wiki is near empty about this
<namarrgon>	_i_ recommend an ssd for everything
<typh00nz>	gives only info about reducing input output operations
<typh00nz>	i am close to buy my first ssd
<typh00nz>	but
<typh00nz>	what about firmware
<typh00nz>	and software given by them
<typh00nz>	i dont remember exact models
<typh00nz>	but some sort of them uses additional software
<typh00nz>	distributed for [ofc] windows platform
<namarrgon>	you won't need the software, see if they offer linux tools or isos for fw-updates
<typh00nz>	fw = firmware?
<namarrgon>	yeah
<typh00nz>	what is isos?
<namarrgon>	i mean bootable images in general
<namarrgon>	so you don't need windows specifically
<typh00nz>	aha
<typh00nz>	which model do you use?
<namarrgon>	iirc, a crucial c300 and a 830 from samsung
<typh00nz>	intel models look safe and stable
<typh00nz>	aha
<typh00nz>	and last, more practical question
<typh00nz>	is 128gb enough for system [i cant afford bigger atm] + hdd for media things
<typh00nz>	or do would you recommend to wait, spare some more cash and buy bigger on
<typh00nz>	one
<namarrgon>	128 just for arch?
<namarrgon>	http://ix.io/itp
<namarrgon>	i don't think i ever ran out of space
<typh00nz>	yeah, whole space is for arch
<typh00nz>	8 months ago i made yolo action and changed os to only linux, especially arch
<typh00nz>	what command did you use
<typh00nz>	paths to filesystem look strange
<typh00nz>	df?
<namarrgon>	df -h / /home
<typh00nz>	ah right u re using volumes
<tak3r07>	hey there! i've got a little question regarding fonts in arch. i was using cinnamon the last past weeks and just gave plasma a try and installed kde-applications-meta and plasma-meta. after playing around with it for a few hours i came back to cinnamon and uninstalled the kde-packages. but now all my gtk-applications have changed its font and i cannot revert it via standard settings in cinnamon. it says i am using "sans regular
<tak3r07>	9" but the font in chromium for example is definitly not sans.
<kyusaki>	hello o/
<sniper570>	hallo \o
<kyusaki>	do you guise know from where my spotify notification comes from ? http://i.imgur.com/p1hcgzx.png (i have awesome wm but i haven't found anything with naughty).
<kyusaki>	it's a little too big, the picture so i want to resize the picture :p
<tigrmesh>	there may be a spotify or .spotify file or folder somewhere in your home directory
<tigrmesh>	if you have locate/mlocate installed, and the db is up-to-date, you can run  locate spotify | grep home
<tigrmesh>	which will find every file on your system that has the string "spotify" and then select the ones that also have the string "home" - which should pretty much be only your home directory
