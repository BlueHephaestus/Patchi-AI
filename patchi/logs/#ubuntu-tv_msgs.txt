<jussi> popey: you probably want to remove the vo from your flags, so you dont get auto opped everythime you join
<willcooke> hi folks!
<willcooke> thanks popey for setting this up for me
<popey> np
<willcooke> :(
<jussi> nah, just kidding
<jussi> willcooke: tell me how to tar a dir from the cli. im tired and the man page is doing my head in
<willcooke> tar -cvjf foo.tar.bz2 dir/*
<jussi> thanks!
<willcooke> :d
<willcooke> caveat:  i haven't tested that
<willcooke> it might not, and probably wont, work
<willcooke> oh, an i assumed you want to compress it, which you might not want to.  "j" will create bz2 and "z" will create gz
<jussi> it appears to have works, lets see how we go
