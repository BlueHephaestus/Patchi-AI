[05:35]  * hadenx facepalm
[05:38] <hadenx> btw , jjk_saji , I am very keen on your plan on promoting Ubuntu to schools..
[05:38] <jjk_saji> You can help me,
[05:39] <hadenx> jjk_saji , sure .. I'm sure all of us here can contribute in some way or the other
[05:39] <jjk_saji> right now I am working on NI model school, last saturday I went there meet pricipal, head masters
[05:39] <jjk_saji> right now I want support in creating a document why a  school should  select Ubuntu for its educatinal need
[05:40] <hadenx> Jjk_saji I'm actually working on that ...
[05:40] <jjk_saji> also I need support in helping the IT support staff over there in there ubunut doubts
[05:40] <jjk_saji> I will ask them also to be a part of IIRC and take help
[05:41] <hadenx> This weekend I'll be busy cos of church activities ... Next week I can have a documentation n presentation ready ..
[05:42] <hadenx> jjk_saji , yeah sure ... We can help them out on IRC .
[05:44] <nlsthzn> gents... I have to go sleepy now... one more night to go :)
[05:44] <nlsthzn> cheers
[05:45] <hadenx> Btw , jjk_saji , you have these Linux training session right ?
[05:46] <hadenx> Where do they take place ?
[05:48] <jjk_saji> you mean destinationopensoure.com
[05:48] <hadenx> Yes...
[05:49] <jjk_saji> No fixed place, I ask any office near me for the space for free, if they give I conduct there some where near to my office, place varies depending on the availablity
[05:50] <hadenx> jjk_saji are any sessions going on at the moment ?
[05:50] <jjk_saji> Next batch it is going to start by June 1'st week for 20 hours
[05:51] <jjk_saji> the present batch classes are over and candidates are supposed to do the assignments
[05:52] <hadenx> that's great .. Have a friend who is interested ..
[05:57] <hadenx> anyway jjk_saji , can you give a brief idea on what we might be targeting at ?
[05:58] <hadenx> Or what you plan introducing to the Schools admins ?
[05:59] <jjk_saji> destination training and school activities are both different
[05:59] <jjk_saji> DOS session is open to IT support guys from the industry for are not knowing how to use LINUX
[06:00] <jjk_saji> my Scholl activity is different , there I am  trying to co-ordinate with the "it staf" and install Ubunut over ther
[06:01] <hadenx> jjk_saji , server side or the client machines ?
[06:01] <jjk_saji> at school client machine first , in DOS server side has priority
[06:03] <hadenx> jjk_saji , you have any clue as to what the current major applications on server side at schools are ?
[06:03] <jjk_saji> File sharing + some application developed on .net for school admin
[06:04] <hadenx> Filesharing we can manage .. .net apps is a problem ..
[06:05] <hadenx> Was going through edubuntu the other day , there's a great free application for school admins to use...
[06:07] <jjk_saji> First we have to bring ubuntu to the lab
[06:08] <jjk_saji> changing admin software which they had purchased will be tough

[08:26] <hadenx> Hey Toki...
[08:26] <hadenx> xnixan .. Yes :)
[08:26] <xnixan> hadenx, i am in ;)

[08:28] <hadenx> xnixan , great .. Hope to see you often on IRC then.. :)
[08:28] <xnixan> hadenx, me too :)
[08:29] <xnixan> i was a very active user @ eglug, till 2004
[08:29] <Toki> xnixan: Shall we introduce ourselves? I'm the so-called 'community manager', attended all the meetups so far, though missed yesterday's meeting.
[08:29] <Toki> *IRC meeting

[08:33] <xnixan> I am Ahmad Hamada, using Unix/Unix Like systems since 1996, fall in love with linux since 2000, working as Linux System Administrator for more than 8 yrs, attended one meetup (second one) tried to attend the rest but i could not :(, hope to see this community growing bigger and bigger :)
[08:34] <Toki> xnixan: We've met, though I don't exactly remember you/ :(
[08:34] <xnixan> Toki, NP
[08:34] <Toki> You should've attended the installfest.

[08:36] <Toki> xnixan: Hope to see you in the future events - your knowledge and experience would come in handy.
[08:36] <xnixan> Toki, it would be always my pleasure :)
[08:36] <xnixan> Toki, the best thing for this LUG is launching this Channel, a community without IRC is useless!
[08:38] <Toki> xnixan: Agreed, a simple discussion board just doesn't cut it.

[21:27] <bassem_lap> xnixan, good, driving center with linux!
[21:27] <xnixan> bassem_lap, :), why not?
[21:27] <bassem_lap> xnixan, it's rare to see linux here!

[21:31] <bassem_lap> xnixan, do you have any idea how it cost to attend the lessons ! the whole cost
[21:31] <xnixan> bassem_lap, LOL
[21:31] <xnixan> bassem_lap, i thought this is LUG IRC channel :p
[21:32] <xnixan> bassem_lap, any way, do you have driving license form Syria?
[21:32] <bassem_lap> xnixan, nope, I have to take all the lessons
[21:33] <xnixan> bassem_lap, did not get it
[21:33] <xnixan> bassem_lap, are you a student in any other institute ?
[21:34] <bassem_lap> xnixan, no, I don't have any kind of license
[21:34] <xnixan> bassem_lap, aha
[21:34] <xnixan> bassem_lap, around 4200-4400 AED
[21:35] <xnixan> bassem_lap, till you get your license in your hand ;)
[21:35] <bassem_lap> xnixan, oh, no! it's very expensive !!!
[21:36] <xnixan> bassem_lap, as far as i know, this is the lowest between all 5 driving centers!
[21:36] <bassem_lap> xnixan, one payment ?
[21:36] <xnixan> bassem_lap, the difference is not too much, but this is the lowest
[21:37] <xnixan> bassem_lap, if you paid the full amount you will get 10% discount
[21:37] <xnixan> bassem_lap, but you do not need to do so
[21:37] <xnixan> bassem_lap, just pay as you go through process
[21:38] <bassem_lap> xnixan, period ?
[21:38] <bassem_lap> xnixan, duration
[21:39] <xnixan> bassem_lap, if you take daily classes, (4-6)
[21:39] <xnixan> bassem_lap, after 10-14 days you will get your license
[21:40] <xnixan> bassem_lap, of course if you passed final test from first time
[21:40] <bassem_lap> xnixan, let's make it simple! can I pay it in two months ?
[21:40] <xnixan> bassem_lap, NP
[21:40] <xnixan> bassem_lap, the only restriction, do not stop taking lessons for more that 2 months
[21:41] <bassem_lap> xnixan, I live in Dubai marina and work near burj dubai! is there any near center?
