<cob>	hi, does anyone know if there's a channel specific to phantomjs-node ?
<cob>	anyway, I have a question that is pertaining to that... i'd like to use phantom-node because i want to do some filesystem things, i just find it easier to use some npm modules than have to code everything compatible with phantomjs. if there's a place where there are libraries available for phantomjs please enlighten me.

<r0sk>	hey guys, good morning, a question about phantom... I'm running python tests successfully til a point where phantom seems to crash:
<r0sk>	File ".../lib/python2.7/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/chrome/service.py",
<r0sk>	line 70, in start http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver")
<r0sk>	WebDriverException: Message: 'chromedriver' executable needs to be available in the path.
<r0sk>	and dunno what could be the reason
<r0sk>	it's osx, I've tried binary from ports, directly downloaded from phantomjs web and with a built binary (1.9.8) with same result
<r0sk>	any clue?
<r0sk>	is anyone awake?
<zlude>	a lot of time to install phantomjs O_o
<Pilate>	installing should be quick, compiling is not
<zlude>	Pilate, compiling... maybe it's running about 10 ~ 15 min and compiling yet Q.Q
<Pilate>	depending on what youre compiling on, it could be a few more hours
<zlude>	Pilate, Ubuntu 4GB RAM + i5
<Vitallium>	and if you don't have at least 4 Gb RAM, it will fail.
<zlude>	omg
<Vitallium>	:-)
<zlude>	in this case, what can I do? .-. Because... "Binary packages for Linux are still being prepared. There are still issues to be solved until a static build is available (see issue 12948 for more details)."
<zlude>	crying... missing my macbook pro that was hardware crash last week
<zlude>	sorry my bad english too .-.
<Vitallium>	zlude: well, we have non-released binaries for Debian Stable and Ubuntu
<zlude>	where?
<zlude>	Done! apt-get install phantomjs works..
<zlude>	phantomjs --version output => 1.4.0
<Vitallium>	lol
<zlude>	what's the current stable version?
<zlude>	2.0
<zlude>	?
<Vitallium>	for 1.x = 1.9.0, for 2.x - 2.0.0
<zlude>	So, I'll try do what I want using 1.4.0, thank you anyway!
<zlude>	Vitallium, I tried run a example from: https://github.com/barrosfilipe/url-to-screenshot, exactly the example.js, error i've got: undefined:0 Unknown module ./ for require()
<zlude>	Can I specify the required manually? And.. what exactly this required call?
<Vitallium>	zlude: you don't need this module to make a screenshot. Just use plain PhantomJS API
<r0sk>	Vitallium: 1.9.0 or 1.9.8?
<Vitallium>	zlude: `require` in PhantomJS is similar to nodejs one
<Vitallium>	r0sk: whoops, yeah, 1.9.8
<r0sk>	:)
<r0sk>	may I repaste the question I did this morning?, any clue will be welcomed!
<Vitallium>	r0sk: yup
<r0sk>	File ".../lib/python2.7/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/chrome/service.py",
<r0sk>	line 70, in start http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver")
<r0sk>	WebDriverException: Message: 'chromedriver' executable needs to be available in the path.
<r0sk>	and dunno what could be the reason it's osx, I've tried binary from ports, directly downloaded from phantomjs web and with a built binary (1.9.8) with same result
<r0sk>	I'm running about 200 tests or more, and the crash is always happening at the same point
<Vitallium>	r0sk: um, you are trying to use ChromeDriver, when you should use GhostDriver
<r0sk>	there are some tests passing, and suddenly, it appears to fail
<r0sk>	Vitallium: I've tested with PhantomJS and with ChromeDriver
<r0sk>	sorry, that's the error related to chromedriver, the one related to phanthomjs is this one:
<r0sk>	File ".../lib/python2.7/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/phantomjs/service.py",
<r0sk>	line 75, in start raise WebDriverException("Unable to start phantomjs with ghostdriver.", e)
<r0sk>	WebDriverException: Message: Unable to start phantomjs with ghostdriver.
<r0sk>	Screenshot: available via screen
<Vitallium>	r0sk: you're experiencing a crash, try to make a small example and post it to github
<Vitallium>	r0sk: also, ghostdriver is not compatible with phantomjs 2
<r0sk>	1.9.8 here
<r0sk>	I've prepared this gist, dunno if it could be helpful: https://gist.github.com/oscarmlage/604355b72768796ab9af
<Vitallium>	r0sk: you should have file called `ghostdriver.log`. This file contains all output from ghostdriver. Can you find it?
<r0sk>	yes
<Vitallium>	can you post it somewhere?
<r0sk>	I was tail -f'ing while testing, but can't understand all that information
<r0sk>	Vitallium: sure!
<r0sk>	Vitallium: https://gist.github.com/oscarmlage/604355b72768796ab9af (gist updated with last lines of ghostdriver.log)
<Vitallium>	this selenium==2.45.0
<Vitallium>	r0sk: ghostdriver doesn't work with 2.45.0. It requires in update
<r0sk>	hmm
<r0sk>	a selenium update?
<Vitallium>	r0sk: yeah, we should update selenium binding
<Vitallium>	to the latest release
<r0sk>	hmm may I try to update selenium in my enviroment (pip)
<Vitallium>	r0sk: you need to downgrade it
<r0sk>	ah
<r0sk>	which version do you think it could work?
<Vitallium>	r0sk: 2.44.0
<r0sk>	Vitallium: nice, I'm going to try it
<r0sk>	would be really nice if it runs!
<r0sk>	I'll pay you some beers!
<r0sk>	Vitallium: are there some known issues related to osx or any python version?
<Vitallium>	r0sk: I don't remember any :( because I don't use osx
<r0sk>	np, ty anyway
<r0sk>	(they're still running with selenium 2.44.0 now, lets see)
<zlude>	Vitallium, http://pastie.org/private/jnrjrbn8kyjh11eot4qigg it's working... But it 'crop' the page.. can I get 640x640 with full page width? no height, just width.
<zlude>	Result of image here: http://s22.postimg.org/tol5aw53l/github.png
<Vitallium>	zlude: use `viewportSize` instead of `clipRect`
<zlude>	doesn't work :/
<Vitallium>	zlude: what do you mean by `full page width`?
<zlude>	wait, i will show you
<zlude>	Vitallium, I do it manually, using Gimp to resize and crop, Look: http://s4.postimg.org/dih210ldp/github_640_640_manual_resize_and_crop_using_gimp.png
<zlude>	Can I get a similar result using phantomjs?
<zlude>	Vitallium, First image Look: "http://imgur.com/a/xk4Gi" I'm using clipRect to 640x640, Second image I resize and crop manually. I wanna know if can I get a similar output from image two using PhantomJS
<Vitallium>	zlude: use `clipRect`. `clipRect` define a rectangle which will be rendered by PhantomJS
<Vitallium>	defines*
<Vitallium>	zlude: 1) Set up `viewportSize` (your virtual window size) 2) Use `clipRect` to define a rectangular area to render
<zlude>	Ok, let me try
<zlude>	Vitallium, no success...

<cob>	hi all!
<Pilate>	hello
<cob>	anyone using phantomjs-node have an issue with a leftover process (easily identified as shim.js), and identified how to solve it?
<cob>	hi Pilate, what's your favorite headless browser?
<Pilate>	phantomjs :P
<Pilate>	but i dont use any of the third party stuff :(
<cob>	do you know a good source for vanilla phantomjs libs? (such as loading config from files, etc)
<Pilate>	not really :/ ive just implemented everything ive ever needed
<cob>	I always think "why re-implement an ini file parser?"
<cob>	or writer, or database connector, etc
<Pilate>	JSON.parse, ezmode
<cob>	actually it's the webdriver i should be using
<ghanima>	when building phantomjs
<ghanima>	is there a way to compile it as a static binary
<Pilate>	isnt that the default?
<ghanima>	Pilate: when I do a ldd I see libraries linked to it

<lsolesen>	I have Behat tests which works great when running it in selenium in e.g. Firefox. However when I run the Behat tests from the command line in Phantom JS, they fail. Something from the page is simply missing (Drupal Panels IPE buttons) both if I take a screenshot with PhantomJS or "print last response" with Behat. Do any of you experienced similar issues?
<Pilate>	debug
<lsolesen>	Pilate: Yeah. I've been doing that for a lot of time already. Do not know where to look. Everything is working manually and in Firefox :/
<Pilate>	so what have you done for debugging? whats the error output? did any requests fail? are you using features that your version of phantom doesnt support?
<lsolesen>	There is no error output when watching the console ouput.
<lsolesen>	I tried putting in some waits in the Behat tests to make sure that PhantomJS was not just too quick to look for stuff.
