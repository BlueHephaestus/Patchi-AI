<nlsthzn> jjk_saji: mr. joseph, welcome :)
<nlsthzn> hadenx: ubuntulo1_ is a bot... :)
<hadenx> btw , jjk_saji , i am very keen on your plan on promoting ubuntu to schools..
<jjk_saji> you can help me,
<hadenx> jjk_saji , sure .. i'm sure all of us here can contribute in some way or the other
<jjk_saji> right now i am working on ni model school, last saturday i went there meet pricipal, head masters
<jjk_saji> right now i want support in creating a document why a  school should  select ubuntu for its educatinal need
<hadenx> jjk_saji i'm actually working on that ...
<jjk_saji> also i need support in helping the it support staff over there in there ubunut doubts
<jjk_saji> i will ask them also to be a part of iirc and take help
<hadenx> this weekend i'll be busy cos of church activities ... next week i can have a documentation n presentation ready ..
<hadenx> jjk_saji , yeah sure ... we can help them out on irc .
<nlsthzn> gents... i have to go sleepy now... one more night to go :)
<nlsthzn> cheers
<hadenx> btw , jjk_saji , you have these linux training session right ?
<hadenx> where do they take place ?
<jjk_saji> you mean destinationopensoure.com
<hadenx> yes...
<jjk_saji> no fixed place, i ask any office near me for the space for free, if they give i conduct there some where near to my office, place varies depending on the availablity
<hadenx> jjk_saji are any sessions going on at the moment ?
<jjk_saji> next batch it is going to start by june 1'st week for 20 hours
<jjk_saji> the present batch classes are over and candidates are supposed to do the assignments
<hadenx> that's great .. have a friend who is interested ..
<hadenx> anyway jjk_saji , can you give a brief idea on what we might be targeting at ?
<hadenx> or what you plan introducing to the schools admins ?
<jjk_saji> destination training and school activities are both different
<jjk_saji> dos session is open to it support guys from the industry for are not knowing how to use linux
<jjk_saji> my scholl activity is different , there i am  trying to co-ordinate with the "it staf" and install ubunut over ther
<hadenx> jjk_saji , server side or the client machines ?
<jjk_saji> at school client machine first , in dos server side has priority
<hadenx> jjk_saji , you have any clue as to what the current major applications on server side at schools are ?
<jjk_saji> file sharing + some application developed on .net for school admin
<hadenx> filesharing we can manage .. .net apps is a problem ..
<hadenx> was going through edubuntu the other day , there's a great free application for school admins to use...
<jjk_saji> first we have to bring ubuntu to the lab
<jjk_saji> changing admin software which they had purchased will be tough

<xnixan> hadenx, any experience with asterisk?
<hadenx> xnixan , no not really ... but i've read through the documentation ..
<toki> wai~! new people!
<hadenx> xnixan , how good are you at troubleshooting linux issues ?
<xnixan> hadenx, hehe
<xnixan> hadenx, depending on the issue, do you have any?
<hadenx> xnixan , we need people on irc..
<hadenx> help out those who have issues...
<xnixan> hadenx, do you mean for support?
<hadenx> hey toki...
<hadenx> xnixan .. yes :)
<xnixan> hadenx, i am in ;)
<toki> xnixan: advanced support, or basic?
<xnixan> toki, both, :d
<toki> tier 2 you are. :d
<hadenx> xnixan , great .. hope to see you often on irc then.. :)
<xnixan> hadenx, me too :)
<xnixan> i was a very active user @ eglug, till 2004
<toki> xnixan: shall we introduce ourselves? i'm the so-called 'community manager', attended all the meetups so far, though missed yesterday's meeting.
<toki> *irc meeting
<toki> tier 1 support guy as well.
<hadenx> xnixan , what happened to eglug?
<xnixan> hadenx, egyptian linux users group
<hadenx> oh ok.. how's the group going ?
<xnixan> i am ahmad hamada, using unix/unix like systems since 1996, fall in love with linux since 2000, working as linux system administrator for more than 8 yrs, attended one meetup (second one) tried to attend the rest but i could not :(, hope to see this community growing bigger and bigger :)
<toki> xnixan: we've met, though i don't exactly remember you/ :(
<xnixan> toki, np
<toki> you should've attended the installfest.
<xnixan> :)
<toki> we had two laptops we had to return because of x problems.
<xnixan> toki, i was dreaming of that, but it was out of my hand :(
<toki> xnixan: hope to see you in the future events - your knowledge and experience would come in handy.
<xnixan> toki, it would be always my pleasure :)
<xnixan> toki, the best thing for this lug is launching this channel, a community without irc is useless!
<toki> xnixan: agreed, a simple discussion board just doesn't cut it.
<xnixan> toki, yep!, irc, faster and much more interactive ;)
<xnixan> toki, what is your name?
<bojicas> toki: minutes of meeting: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/emiratesteam/meetings/ircmeetingsummary20110417

<bassem_lap> xnixan, yes
<xnixan> bassem_lap, which in which sector your company is working in?

<bassem_lap> xnixan, sorry
<bassem_lap> xnixan, you?
<xnixan> bassem_lap, i am a system and network administrator in driving center
<xnixan> nlsthzn-work, evening :)
<nlsthzn-work> xnixan: welcome, not seen you on irc yet :)
<xnixan> nlsthzn-work, thanks, i was here in morning!
<nlsthzn-work> xnixan: ah, ok... sorry, i was sleeping then :)
<xnixan> nlsthzn-work, np ;)
<xnixan> nlsthzn-work, since when you are using linux?
<bassem_lap> xnixan, linux admin?
<xnixan> bassem_lap, yep!
<nlsthzn-work> xnixan: on and off since around 1998 actually... but mostly on windows... only a bit more permanent the last two years (and still windows for gaming)
<bassem_lap> xnixan, good, driving center with linux!
<xnixan> bassem_lap, :), why not?
<bassem_lap> xnixan, it's rare to see linux here!
<xnixan> bassem_lap, our proxy, mail, dns, fw all are 100% linux
<bassem_lap> xnixan, great!
<bassem_lap> xnixan, which school?
<xnixan> al ahli driving center
<nlsthzn-work> cool to hear :)
<xnixan> nlsthzn-work, :) thanks!
<bassem_lap> xnixan, do you have any idea how it cost to attend the lessons ! the whole cost
<xnixan> bassem_lap, lol
<xnixan> bassem_lap, i thought this is lug irc channel :p
<xnixan> bassem_lap, any way, do you have driving license form syria?
<bassem_lap> xnixan, nope, i have to take all the lessons
<xnixan> bassem_lap, did not get it
<xnixan> bassem_lap, are you a student in any other institute ?
<bassem_lap> xnixan, no, i don't have any kind of license
<xnixan> bassem_lap, aha
<xnixan> bassem_lap, around 4200-4400 aed
<xnixan> bassem_lap, till you get your license in your hand ;)
<bassem_lap> xnixan, oh, no! it's very expensive !!!
<xnixan> bassem_lap, as far as i know, this is the lowest between all 5 driving centers!
<bassem_lap> xnixan, one payment ?
<xnixan> bassem_lap, the difference is not too much, but this is the lowest
<xnixan> bassem_lap, if you paid the full amount you will get 10% discount
<xnixan> bassem_lap, but you do not need to do so
<xnixan> bassem_lap, just pay as you go through process
<bassem_lap> xnixan, period ?
<bassem_lap> xnixan, duration
<xnixan> bassem_lap, if you take daily classes, (4-6)
<xnixan> bassem_lap, after 10-14 days you will get your license
<xnixan> bassem_lap, of course if you passed final test from first time
<bassem_lap> xnixan, let's make it simple! can i pay it in two months ?
<xnixan> bassem_lap, np
<xnixan> bassem_lap, the only restriction, do not stop taking lessons for more that 2 months
<bassem_lap> xnixan, i live in dubai marina and work near burj dubai! is there any near center?
<xnixan> bassem_lap, sure, our ho @ al qouz
