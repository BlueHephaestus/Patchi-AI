<h00k> mr_steve: do you happen to be around?
<mr_steve> h00k, i am
<h00k> mr_steve: can you grab the latest branch and give voicecheck a try again?
<mr_steve> sure can
<h00k> i didn't update the .tar.gz yet
<mr_steve> looks like the latest revision works for me too
<h00k> ahha, alright.
<h00k> and the tarball is released
<takyoji> i love how pathetic the people that administrate our school district are
<takyoji> apparently i was talking with with the teacher that helps with the school newspaper, and was talking on the topic of raising awareness of the issue i wrote about, and she said that she's trying to go infront of a school board over the idea of having the school news also available online and one of the arguments against it is that the website might attract online sexual predators.
<tonyyarusso> wait, what?
<tonyyarusso> sexual predators for a non-interactive read-only news site posted by adults?
<leaf> with studan names & very likely their pictures too
<leaf> er, student
<tonyyarusso> well, he only said news so far.
<tonyyarusso> but it's also very common practice to have policies for things like only using first names and not identifying which person goes with which name, and whatever - the bsa has a web site photo policy like that, and it seems to work fine.
<tonyyarusso> and it would still be easier to go pick kids off at the bus stop randomly than to see them online and then try to track down certain ones later....
