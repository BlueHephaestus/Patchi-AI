[17:01] <NginUS> Is there a standard for where file paths should be on github-built apps? I had Icecast2 installed gfrom the repo, but needed to install a new version for royalty payment automation. Now I dunno where to put my config file or where to point the paths in it.
[17:07] <devster31> what's this line do in .profile ERM=${TERM:-cons25}
[17:07] <devster31> ?
[17:40] <devster31> NginUS no, no standard, but it's usually documented in the wiki or readme from the apps, also, you can try going through the Makefile and see what operation the make install does, and revert them, sometimes there's a make uninstall too
[18:02] <NginUS> devster31: thx

[19:10] <jack_> now, my problem.
[19:12] <jack_> I have an old hp mediasmart server that corrupt. I took out and recovered the data and put ubuntu as a server back on the mediasmart server. It worked on a temporary machine, but now I'm getting squat.
[19:12] <jack_> Would you know anything about that or where else I could ask?
[19:13] <Rob__> your ognna need to be more specific
[19:16] <jack_> ex475 mediasmart server, ubuntu 14.04, on the temp machine, I was able to connect to a web server running on it through its local ip, but still didn't work on the mediasmart server. Then I tried editing the network interfaces, adding auto eth0 didn't help either.
[19:18] <jack_> on the mediasmart server, both the power and internet lights are nice and blue, but the health light is blinking and the led that should indicate the hard drive is not on
