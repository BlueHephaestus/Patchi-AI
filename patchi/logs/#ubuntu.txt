[00:01] <GefilteFish> Can someone help me fix this "boot device not found 3f0" error? What I did was delete my EFI partition now I'm stuck with a bricked laptop with Xubuntu installed, but inaccessible. All the Linux distros I've tried on a LiveUSB won't boot. Super Grub2 Disk is the only exception but it's kind of useless. I can use it to get to Xubuntu's terminal though.
[00:04] <bekks> Fuchs: still no luck. your /etc/sudoers.d/virtualbox suggestion works, but I have no access to directories/files owned by vbox:vbox when running gksudo /usr/bin/VBoxManage
[00:04] <Fuchs> bekks: well, is root part of the vbox group?
[00:05] <bekks> not until now
[00:05] <tgm4883> uh, would root not have access to everything?
[00:05] <bekks> I guess I have to re-login now?
[00:06] <Fuchs> bekks: nope
[00:06] <dprc> tgm4883: most of the time
[00:06] <Fuchs> thinking of it, is camel part of the vbox group?
[00:07] <Fuchs> even though I am rather sure that file permissions are based on the user you run the command as (and local short tests confirm that), but not knowing what exactly the script does
[00:07] <bekks> Fuchs: thomasvs_ he scrp
[00:07] <Fuchs> wat
[00:08] <bekks> sorry :)
[00:09] <bekks> the script runs: "/usr/bin/VBoxHeadless -s myvm", but I get a permission denied
[00:10] <Fuchs> it would be interesting to see on what it actually fails, maybe strace would do, but that sounds like a bit of an overkill
[00:10] <EriC^^> bekks: camel is your user or the user you want to run as?
[00:11] <Fuchs> it is ran as root  (at least that is what we specified in the sudoers) by camel
[00:11] <bekks> camel is the user who wants to run the script which executes /usr/bin/VBoxHeadless -s myvm as vbox user.
[00:11] <Fuchs> err, wait
[00:11] <Fuchs> bekks: can I see that sudo command
[00:12] <Fuchs> because I, fully on purpose (which I also mentioned), limited it on root and root only. If you want to run it as a different user (and don't talk of the group vbox here) you need to adapt that ...
[00:12] <Fuchs> because yes, otherwise that will very obviously fail
[00:12] <EriC^^> bekks: <your user> ALL= (ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/su camel -lc "bash /path/to/script"
[00:13] <Fuchs> EriC^^: wrong way around. Camel is the user who wants to run the script, not a user wants to run it as camel
[00:13] <EriC^^> oh
[00:14] <Fuchs> the sudoers is likely to be correct, _unless_ he wants to run the command as the user vbox, not root. In that case the (root) should be changed to either (vbox) or, less secure, (ALL)
[00:16] <Fuchs> bekks: or wait, is the script actually ran as root and then that does something as a different user? In that case I'd like to see that script
[00:16] <Fuchs> because chances are that the issue lies there
[00:17] <EriC^^> Fuchs: i think the script runs as camel
[00:17] <Fuchs> nope
[00:17] <EriC^^> i mean by camel as vbox
[00:17] <Fuchs> neither
[00:17] <Fuchs> read backlog, see the sudoers configuration
[00:18] <EriC^^> he said he didn't want to write his password to run it as another user
[00:18] <Fuchs> yes, that I do know.
[00:18] <grend> Fuchs: have you used smarttools to check health of hdd?
[00:19] <grend> I run command that dafty suggested and short self test shows ok
[00:19] <bekks>  /etc/sudoers.d/virtualbox: http://paste.ubuntu.com/11175737/ - command run as user camel: "sudo -u vbox /usr/bin/VirtualBox list runningvms" results in: http://pastebin.com/NFiCGxKs
[00:19] <Fuchs> bekks: yeah, that won't work
[00:20] <Fuchs> bekks: the part in the braces () limits who can run the scripts, as I mentioned, fully on purpose set to root. Either change that to vbox or, less secure, ALL
[00:20] <grend> or perhaps anyone here can help? I plan to reinistall ubuntu and to be sure disk is fine now
[00:21] <daftykins> grend: the command i gave is not going to fix that drive, it was faulty when we first spoke
[00:21] <Fuchs> bekks: because I try to avoid VirtualBox whenever possible, I have no idea whether it somewhere does require root, though
[00:21] <grend> daftykins: it was 1 bad sector
[00:21] <daftykins> grend: again you're ignoring the other part i pointed out :)
[00:21] <grend> daftykins: so I run the command and smart tools
[00:21] <Fuchs> bekks: however, changing that (root) part to either (vbox) or (ALL) should at least work until that point where it does need root permissions
[00:21] <daftykins> grend: unfortunately you gave me a very poor attitude last time you were on, so i no longer wish to assist you.
[00:21] <daftykins> so good luck
[00:21] <grend> thats fine :D
[00:21] <grend> and thanks
[00:22] <EriC^^> Fuchs: he changed it
[00:23] <grend> daftykins: plus attitude is matter of perception and perception varies :) thats that
[00:25] <Fuchs> EriC^^: yeah, we probably resolved it in a channel with less noise and a better language than English.

[00:30] <bazhang> angelle, ask an actual question
[00:30] <angelle> OK
[00:30] <bazhang> angelle, stop knocking
[00:31] <angelle> bazhang what are the pros and cons of installing Ubuntu over windows 10 pro x64?

[00:31] <ubottu> angelle: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, for all Ubuntu-related support questions. Please use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics (though our !guidelines apply there too). Thanks!
[00:31] <bazhang> angelle, great topic for #ubuntu-offtopic not here
[00:31] <angelle> yes that's what I'm asking
[00:31] <dprc> angelle: this is a support channel; if you would like to discuss the merits of ubuntu please /join #ubuntu-discuss
[00:31] <ltk> what's mean "knock"?
[00:31] <angelle> it's Ubuntu related
[00:32] <SchrodingersScat> angelle: not a ubuntu support question
[00:32] <angelle> it means knocking on your door
[00:32] <bazhang> angelle, so go to that channel and ask, this is ubuntu tech support only not polls, opinions etc
[00:32] <angelle> you people are funny
[00:32] <angelle> how could this channel potentially be Ubuntu customer service support if you don't even  know what knock knock is?
[00:33] <bazhang> angelle, and there is a channel just for that type of chit chat, and this one is not it
[00:33] <angelle> I was knocking for like 5 min before someone answered

[01:29] <Quicksteve> hello there, I'm currently trying to install Windows 7 as a secondary OS on my external USB HDD. I have followed the steps outlined here http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/7943-install-windows-7-fast-without-dvd-usb-device.html .That part works without any issues, however I can't get Windows to start. I've tried using update-grup and bootrepair, both add the menu entry, however upon selection it fails with unable to find device
[01:30] <Quicksteve> Here is the link given to me by bootrepair: http://paste.ubuntu.com/11176476/
[01:30] <Bray90820> EriC^^: anything else for me to try
[01:31] <OerHeks> Bray90820, maybe restart samba ..
[01:32] <Quicksteve> Ubuntu is installed on /dev/sda, ubuntu home is on /dev/sdg1, Windows is on /dev/sdg2
[01:33] <Quicksteve> Both ubuntu itself and the user files are encrypted
[01:33] <bodhi_zazen> Quicksteve, probably need to select to boot windows in your bios
[01:34] <Quicksteve> Is there any way I could use it over Grub?
[01:34] <BLACK_POWER> crakkker
[01:38] <Quicksteve> I'll restart and see if selecting that drive in the bios works.
[01:44] <Quicksteve> Hello, I'm back. Sadly, selecting the drive in BIOS does not work, it does not show up.
[01:46] <Quicksteve> Any other ideas possibly?
[01:53] <bodhi_zazen> Quicksteve, what error do you get when you boot windows
[01:54] <Quicksteve> It says something along the lines of: "Disk not found: <volume id here>"
[01:55] <daftykins> sounds like you need to boot Windows media and let it repair boot
[01:59] <ary> Hi. I had installed opera on my elementary os, but flashplugin doesn't work.
[01:59] <ary> how can I put flashplugin to work?
[02:00] <daftykins> !elementary | ary
[02:00] <ubottu> ary: Elementary OS is an Ubuntu derivative which is supported in their IRC channel #elementary on irc.freenode.net - http://elementaryos.org/ for more information on this distribution.
[02:00] <daftykins> sorry no support here
[02:02] <Quicksteve> the actual error message was "error: no such device: <volume id here>"
[02:04] <ary> hi. Now i am on ubuntu. How do I install flashplugin on opera?
[02:04] <Quicksteve> I have checked and blkid outputs the same volume id as in the error:

[02:06] <owen1> ubuntu 14.04 on carbon x1 2nd gen. usb3 is not working. how do i troubleshoot this?
[02:06] <daftykins> 14.04.2 ? which kernel?
[02:07] <owen1> daftykins: are u talking to me?
[02:08] <daftykins> yes
[02:08] <owen1> 3.16.0-31-generic #43-Ubuntu SMP
[02:08] <daftykins> ok so yeah it's 14.04.2 with the utopic HWE
=== Yukkii is now known as Dhs92
[02:09] <owen1> is it a good thing? (:
[02:09] <daftykins> my advice would be to try a more recent mainline kernel
[02:09] <daftykins> !mainline
[02:09] <ubottu> The kernel team supply continuous mainline kernel builds which can be useful for tracking down issues or testing recent changes in the Linux kernel. More information is available at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/MainlineBuilds
[02:09] <daftykins> 14.04 comes with 3.13 so that's also a plan
[02:09] <owen1> daftykins: i can upgrade to 15.04
[02:09] <owen1> or just do fresh install
[02:10] <daftykins> depends whether you want to abandon LTS.
[02:10] <owen1> daftykins: what's the benefit of staying on LTs?
[02:10] <daftykins> you could at least boot 15.04 and test it out
[02:10] <daftykins> !lts
[02:10] <ubottu> LTS means Long Term Support. Until 12.04 LTS versions of Ubuntu were supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server; since 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) LTS versions will be supported for 5 years on the desktop and server. The latest LTS version of Ubuntu is !Trusty (Trusty Tahr 14.04)
[02:11] <owen1> daftykins: so i can boot ubuntu 15.04 from a usb and not install it, and see if everything works?
[02:11] <daftykins> yip
[02:11] <owen1> perfect! thanks
[02:11] <daftykins> that's what live sessions are for \o/
[02:11] <owen1> hopefuly the usb 3 will work as well
[02:12] <Quicksteve> daftykins, I'm not sure if the windows tools will help here as installing windows on an external drive is normally not possible.
[02:12] <daftykins> it searches for installations and repairs them if necessary, i didn't pay attention to how exotic your setup is :)
[02:13] <Quicksteve> http://paste.ubuntu.com/11176476/ <- output from bootrepair
[02:14] <Quicksteve> I believe that should contain most of the information
[02:15] <daftykins> sorry too late for me, i'm off

[03:13] <GefilteFish> I deleted my efi partition by accident. Howdo i rebuild it?
[03:16] <HedgeMage> GefilteFish: Deleted the partition, or its contents?
=== tahr193531 is now known as stevend4le
[03:22] <GefilteFish> I actually deleted the partition
[03:22] <GefilteFish> But created it
[03:22] <GefilteFish> Recreated it
[03:22] <HedgeMage> Okay, so once you re-created it, did you also set its type to EFI?  That's code ef00 if I recall correctly.
[03:22] <HedgeMage> (I can check)
[03:23] <HedgeMage> Then you'd need to format it to fat 32.  Be careful that it's 32, some older tools default to 16 bit when making vfat filesystems, hell if I know why that's still true.
[03:25] <HedgeMage> Next, replace the EFI partition's UUID in your fstab with the new UUID.
[03:25] <GefilteFish> Ok i did that. It also has a boot flag
[03:26] <HedgeMage> After that, it's possible that reinstalling a package or two (I'd start with your kernel) could automagically repopulate that partition as it should be and tell your UEFI firmware that the Ubuntu system exists.
[03:27] <HedgeMage> If not, I can try to run you through the manual process before I fall asleep, but no guarantee I'll be up that long.

[03:37] <boogieidm> I'm needing to download audio files from a website. Not YouTube or any of that. It's a free audiobook. I did it with the first book, but I can't remember how to with the second book. I used to know a simple way to do this. It was like right click, inspect element, right click and save on the MP3 file link. Any idea how to do this?
[03:38] <Emanuel> I have a USB hard drive that is making clicking sounds. I tried to check the SMART status from my system but it's greyed out. How can I access tis data?
[03:38] <Emanuel> boogieidm: if you know the complete url you can use wget
[03:39] <boogieidm> Emanuel Well it's like a flash player that you have to keep clicking the next chapter on.
[03:39] <aeon-ltd> Fun: there is software that controls screen brightness, i'm pretty sure it's independent from the graphics drivers
[03:40] <Emanuel> Second question I have how to I enable remote desktop forwarding so I can connect remottley with a GUI rather than a ssh terminial connection
[03:40] <Emanuel> boogieidm: No idea then.
[03:40] <aeon-ltd> boogieidm: why can't you do what you did before?
[03:41] <boogieidm> aeon-ltd: I can't remember how I did it. Now I'm thinking it may be wget after a quick google search.

[04:29] <FoolsRun> Hi, I need some basic bash shell scripting help. I need to do a while loop for while the output of a shell command doesn't contain a grep'ed value. Basically while ! hcitool con | grep $MAC   --how do I write that?
[04:40] <Phosis> Question all...and hello...I'm doing something very simple...making a bash script with menu to run my doom mods. When I run it it says /bin/doom: line 1: !#/bin/bas: No such file or directory
[04:40] <Phosis> the interesting is, it still runs.
[04:42] <Phosis> I'm a little confused because after editing my ~/.profile to add the path for the script, I am not exactly sure where it is running the script from. Because if it is removed from /home/username/bin or /bin, either one of those, it will fail to work.
[04:46] <nbt> Phosis: change line 1 of your script to #!/bin/bash
[04:46] <Phosis> It is actually
[04:47] <nbt> no
[04:47] <Phosis> The first line of my script: !#/bin/bash
[04:47] <treelzebub> Phosis: #! != !#  :P
[04:48] <Phosis> Oh christ
[04:48] <Phosis> I didnt notice.
[04:48] <treelzebub> happens to the best of us.
[04:48] <Phosis> Thank you, haha.
[04:48] <Phosis> Yep that certainly fixed it. Thanks again!!
[04:49] <treelzebub> +1 nbt
[04:49] <Phosis> Agreed
=== pferreira is now known as PauloFerreira25
=== owner_ is now known as Guest31519
[04:55] <Phosis> Another question...Looking for more vague direction since I'm learning scripting and don't want much hand holding, but not sure where to start. The script I made runs gzdoom, depending on the option selected, with different WAD files. But when gzdoom quits, the terminal is left waiting for more user input. When really, I'd like the script to stop running altogether after the choice is made and the game boots up.
[04:56] <Phosis> So when you quit game, the script is no longer waiting for input, you are simply back at a bash prompt.
[05:05] <tonyyarusso> Phosis: Pastebin the script?
[05:05] <tonyyarusso> or maybe you already did, /me reads scrollback

[05:13] <quizme> hi, i am trying to get photos from my camera's microsd card onto my computer
[05:13] <quizme> anybody know how to do that ?
[05:13] <basil2x> Stick the microsd in the microsd slot on your computer, or get an adapter and use the sd slot.
[05:13] <quizme> i bought a hytac unversal card reader, but after plugging it in, nothing happens
[05:13] <piter0> lo que pasa es que nadie contesta igual
[05:14] <basil2x> !spanish
[05:14] <basil2x> !spanish pietr0
[05:14] <basil2x> Well that was obviously wrong
[05:15] <basil2x> Hmmm... does the hytac show up in your devices?  quizme
[05:15] <quizme> basil2x: it doesn't show up in the list of /dev/sd* devices
[05:16] <jellow> quizme: does it work anywhere else ?
[05:16] <basil2x> try lsusb
[05:16] <quizme> jellow i only have one computer
[05:16] <basil2x> see if it's there
[05:17] <quizme> basil2x ok
[05:18] <quizme> basil2x: i did lsusb before and after inserting the hytac card reader and the number of lines of output is the same
[05:19] <basil2x> does a line say hytac?
[05:19] <quizme> basil2x: nope, i just checked
[05:19] <basil2x> and are you sticking the card in the right slot, the right way round?
[05:19] <basil2x> Hmmm... then it's not seeing the reader at all.
[05:20] <quizme> i took out the card and reinserted it upside down
[05:20] <basil2x> pastebin the output of lsusb, if you would.
[05:20] <quizme> basil2x ok
[05:20] <tonyyarusso> Phosis: Try this: http://pastebin.com/rSEge98w
[05:21] <basil2x> And... this is important... paste the link in here. ;)
[05:21] <quizme> basil2x http://pastebin.com/87n8WMX1
[05:21] <quizme> :)
[05:22] <basil2x> It's not there at all.
[05:22] <basil2x> You might have a dud, or it might be linux-unfriendly.
[05:23] <basil2x> Not familiar enough with hytac to say which.
[05:23] <quizme> basil2x: i have a Lexr 633x
[05:23] <quizme> microsSDD HC I 32GB
[05:23] <quizme> does that go in the SD or M2 slot of the hytac univrsal sd reader
[05:24] <Ender_Wiggin> Im having issues seeing my ububuntu 14.04 machine on my Win 8.1 and Win 7 machines It was working fine for a while, then just randmly stopped being able to accesss and now I cant even see it under my netowrk at all. My win7 machine sees it, it will let me access folders, but not files
[05:24] <basil2x> there should ne a microSD slot
[05:24] <quizme> which slot is the microSD slot ?
[05:24] <basil2x> Most multi readres have one
[05:24] <quizme> SD or M2 ?
[05:25] <basil2x> Try either.  which one fits it best?
[05:25] <Ender_Wiggin> Actually, now I cant access it either on my Win7 at all
[05:26] <quizme> basil2x i think the SD one
[05:26] <Ender_Wiggin> ahh nvmd think i figured it out
[05:26] <basil2x> OK, quizme
[05:26] <quizme> basil2x i'm gonna reboot. thanks for talking it out with me
[05:26] <quizme> brb
[05:26] <basil2x> But if it's not linux-friendly, your reader, it won't matter.
[05:27] <quizme> basil2x oh
[05:27] <quizme> basil2x so u mean if i inserted the reading device even without the card inserted correctly it should have appeared in lsusb ?
[05:27] <basil2x> Yup
[05:27] <quizme> basil2x ok
[05:28] <quizme> so i wasted $8 i guess
[05:28] <basil2x> If it was only £6, you got off lucky.
[05:29] <quizme> basil2x i pressed the plug in further and a red light turned on
[05:29] <quizme> let me try again
[05:29] <basil2x> Well, there you go
[05:30] <quizme> basil2x still not showing up in lusb

[05:41] <quizme_> basil2x: it's the same
[05:44] <basil2x> I'd say get one from a different manufacturer, quizme_ .  At £6, it's not a big spend.
[05:44] <quizme_> basil2x yeah thank you for your help

[05:56] <ki7mt> basil2x, this is a rather complex question. Ubuntu imports source packages from Debian, not binary packages, those are built on Launchpad. See this link for details: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebianImportFreeze
[05:57] <wafflejock> MichaelHabib, yeah understandable personally I setup my server so it does continuous integration stuff using Jenkins so when I push changes with git to the server it automatically builds and backs up and deploys sites for users, and I just control access to git itself using GitLab so no one else needs hands on the server

[06:05] <edwardT> ok
[06:06] <ki7mt> edwardT, Debian does not release on a schedule like Ubuntu. It's when the power to be determine when it's time. That could be one year or two or more.

[06:11] <backbox_> i was kickout as net1pcCrypto and as ChicagoXXX and I'm back as backbox.....hahaha......give the hackers a break....lol
[06:12] <Bray90820> zerowaitstate: What should I add to mount /dev/sda
[06:12] <zerowaitstate> um, is /dev/sda partitioned?
[06:12] <zerowaitstate> Bray90820: lsblk should tell you what partitions are available
[06:13] <Bray90820> Yes
[06:13] <zerowaitstate> you mount a particular partition, i.e., /dev/sda5
[06:13] <Bray90820> I wanna add dev/sda3/ and dev/sdb/ ro fstab
[06:13] <hdon_> Bray90820: /dev/sda refers to your disk, but /dev/sda1 for example refers to a particular partition on that disk
[06:13] <RoBo_V> using rtcwake does it take any power if yes how much approx or negligible
[06:13] <ki7mt> /dev/sda would be the device, not a partition .. you don't mount devices, you mount partitions on a device.
[06:13] <Bray90820> dev/sdb1
[06:14] <hdon_> ki7mt: well, you CAN mount a disk... if the disk begins with a filesystem and not a partition table
[06:14] <Bray90820> Ahh your right
[06:14] <zerowaitstate> read the man page for fstab. generally you can use the "defaults" option and it works well enough
[06:14] <backbox_>  12
[06:14] <backbox_> down vote
[06:14] <backbox_> accepted
[06:14] <backbox_> 	
[06:14] <backbox_> You can use fdisk to have an idea of what kind of partitions you have, for example:
[06:14] <backbox_> fdisk -l
[06:15] <ki7mt> hdon_, true, ok, but is that what he wants
[06:15] <hdon_> :3
[06:15] <zerowaitstate> you will have to specify the filesystem type in fstab, but lsblk should tell you that
[06:16] <zerowaitstate> sorry, i meant blkid
[06:16] <hdon_> :)
[06:16] <Bray90820> backbox_: do you mean like the mount point or what
[06:17] <zerowaitstate> backbox_: don't pay attention to blackbox; he is spamming with scripts or something
[06:18] <zerowaitstate> Bray90820: fdisk -l or gdisk -l works, depending on whether the device is partitioned using MBR or GPT
[06:19] <ki7mt> Bray90820,tell us what you have and what your trying to automount, sd card, USB device, second had drive .. it is partitioned with a file system ?
[06:19] <rahsd> hi
[06:19] <rahsd> I want to compile somethings. What should i apt-get install to be able to do that
[06:19] <Bray90820> zerowaitstate: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/11c4df023a1cc068cf57
[06:19] <Bray90820> It didn't work correctly
[06:20] <rahsd> what is the meta package for make 4make gcc binutils headers and ...
[06:20] <ki7mt> rahsd, You have a C compiler installed by default
[06:20] <zerowaitstate> Bray90820: however, blkid will give you the UUID of the filesystem. This is useful, as you can use that to specify the partition, instead of /dev/sda1 for example. This is useful if the enumeration of the drives change, such as can happen if you move a disk to a different SATA channel
[06:20] <zerowaitstate> Bray90820: you gotta preface your command with sudo
[06:21] <yurikoles> build-essnetials
[06:21] <rahsd> ki7mt: automake linux headers and ...?
[06:21] <zerowaitstate> Bray90820: you need root permission to see the raw block device

[06:21] <yurikoles> build-essentials
[06:21] <yurikoles> yes
[06:21] <yurikoles> and also apt-get buil-dep <package>
[06:21] <yurikoles> bu you have to enable deb-srs repos

=== hdon_ is now known as hdon
[06:22] <yurikoles> in software center there is option for managing source.list
[06:23] <zerowaitstate> yurikoles: you have to uncomment the proper lines in sources.list
[06:23] <ki7mt> rahsd, build-essential is primarily for packaging, it even states that in the description . and build-dep would probably require enable source packages in your source lists.
[06:23] <zerowaitstate> yurikoles: then run apt-get update
[06:23] <yurikoles> it's not for me
[06:23] <yurikoles> it's for rahsd
[06:23] <zerowaitstate> for whoever then
[06:23] <yurikoles> I'm trying to explain how to do this in gui
[06:24] <zerowaitstate> i can't be expected to actually read other people's replies when I give advice. it's too distracting
[06:24] <yurikoles> it's very hard to modify something that requires root privileges in linux gui
[06:24] <ki7mt> rahsd, what are you trying to compile, that would make it easier to recommend what you need.

[06:25] <wafflejock> zerowaitstate, guake yo :)
[06:25] <tapout> my headphones won't work, but my speakers do
[06:26] <tapout> when i plug in my headphones, the speakers mute but no sound comes out the phones
[06:26] <yurikoles> rahsd: you need to install nodejs
[06:26] <ki7mt> rahsd, That's .js and json  .. you'd need a JRE package at a minimum
[06:26] <zerowaitstate> ki7mt: uhhhh
[06:26] <zerowaitstate> ki7mt: js is javascript, not java
[06:26] <wafflejock> tapout, check sudo apt-get install alsautils, then alsamixer

[06:27] <zerowaitstate> ki7mt: nodejs stuff runs on V8 javascript VM
[06:27] <yurikoles> it's easy
[06:27] <yurikoles> it install on my mac
[06:27] <yurikoles> will try on debian box
[06:28] <ki7mt> zerowaitstate, Ok, and ?
[06:28] <yurikoles> nope, stretch is not supported
[06:28] <zerowaitstate> i couldn't get used to slap. the text mode mouse integration was weird
[06:28] <HMA> who is hacker in here :)
[06:29] <zerowaitstate> what is a hacker?

[06:29] <zerowaitstate> they make them out of wood now?
[06:29] <HackerII> no
[06:29] <HackerII> steve burned me, so i thought it was fitting
[06:30] <tapout> wafflejock, how do i get it to auto-sense?  now i got the headphones working, no speakers
[06:30] <zerowaitstate> it's a testament to the guy that I don't have to ask which Steve you're talking about
[06:30] <HMA> tell me who is hacker
[06:31] <jaysodyssey> Hacker unlike bill waste of space gates, steve was a visionary, he may have had his issues but he was a man ahead of his time
[06:31] <baldrick> Question: 14.04 LTS - Networking: What files is the GUI network config touching
[06:31] <wafflejock> tapout, not sure exactly what triggers the change between speakers and the jack but alsamixer should let you adjust the levels, is it muting or dropping the levels to 0 when you switch?
[06:31] <HMA> who is hacker let teach me :)
[06:31] <jaysodyssey> lordy i remember alsamixer
[06:31] <jaysodyssey> anyone remember jackedin
[06:31] <zerowaitstate> HMA: this is a support channel, not DefCon
[06:32] <HMA> then ?
[06:32] <tapout> it is, but once it's on headphones, teh sound is stuck to headphones, i can increase the speaker sound and nothing
[06:32] <yurikoles> !hacker | HMA
[06:32] <ubottu> HMA: A hacker is a person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular, as defined by Request for Comments (RFC) 1392 - i.e. a good programmer  -- crackers on the other hand break systems, see also !piracy

[06:35] <varod> i am using ubuntu 15.04 and i am wondering about dnsmasq
[06:35] <Johnny_Linux> el oh el
[06:35] <wafflejock> tapout, you can use lspci -k, to see a list of your hardware with device ids on the left that you can use to search for any known issues or workarounds
[06:35] <yurikoles> dprc, tell me more
[06:35] <Johnny_Linux> arch is broke
[06:35] <kunji> varod: dnsmasq is cool

[06:37] <tapout> it's a pain in the rear unless you like that
[06:37] <tapout> thanks wafflejock
[06:37] <tapout> i'm good enough to keep rocking
[06:37] <dprc> ask archives wayback machine; phrakture rm the thread from bbs (years after the fact)
[06:38] <kunji> OS war is dumb
[06:38] <dprc> happened like 3, 4 times IIRC
[06:38] <kunji> Arch documentation is certainly very nice, I quite often make use of it on Ubuntu
[06:38] <iamrohit7> can anyone compile gnome shell 3.16 on ubuntu without any hiccups?
[06:40] <wafflejock> iamrohit7, nope looks like there's still work on it to even be in a PPA https://launchpad.net/~gnome3-team/+archive/ubuntu/gnome3-staging/?field.series_filter=vivid
[06:41] <wafflejock> iamrohit7, looks like they have it building but says there are still potentially critical problems
[06:42] <iamrohit7> wafflejock: is there any distro that can without any problems?
[06:44] <wafflejock> iamrohit7, well I believe like some people were just discussing arch might be an option https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/gnome-shell/ but you'd probably want to check with their IRC room
[06:44] <wafflejock> also that assumes you're fine with rolling releases
[06:45] <dprc> if building from source, rolling is the last thing you want; unless you feel like chasing git anyway
[06:46] <yurikoles> dprc, that link was not to aur, but for binary package
[06:46] <tapout> best pdf reader for ubuntu is.. ?
[06:47] <dprc> they asked about building it
[06:47] <iamrohit7> wafflejock: i am stuck with some unavailable dependencies on debian 8.
[06:47] <wafflejock> tapout, depends on what you consider best, for some things I've needed Adobe Reader... forget what exactly
[06:47] <iamrohit7> tapout: evince, light and to the point
[06:48] <wafflejock> iamrohit7, ah yeah last one I used was from the PPA I linked above but was 3.14 and still eventually had problems
[06:48] <ki7mt> tapout, for *Nix in general, these are pretty good ; Evince, Okular, Adobe Reader, FoxIt Reader
[06:49] <wafflejock> iamrohit7, I am looking forward to the rework of the notifications though... but will probably just wait for now don't want to have to wipe my work machine for it

[07:27] <yurikoles> but wait
[07:28] <yurikoles> how do you think it will wake up from shutdown state?
[07:28] <dprc> you can use wake-on-lan to bring it back up if the bios/uefi + networking equipment support it
[07:29] <llutz> RoBo_V: acpi-, nvram-wakeup  if your mobo supports it
[07:34] <RoBo_V> yurikoles: or suspend stae

[07:42] <windows7_> who is running #ubuntu on a windows 7 host right now?
[07:43] <yurikoles> what do you mean, like in virtualbox or so?
[07:43] <windows7_> exactly
[07:44] <owen1> (ubuntu 14.04) will 'do-release-upgrade' upgrade me to 14.10 or to 15.04?
[07:44] <llutz> owen1: 14.10
[07:44] <yurikoles> owen1, from what version?
[07:44] <yurikoles> jumps are alovwed for lts only releases
[07:45] <owen1> yurikoles: i am on 14.04
[07:45] <yurikoles> ubuntu way is reinstall
[07:45] <cyberalex4life> it is usually the best way to reinstall
[07:45] <owen1> yurikoles: so it's better to just reinstall? ok
[07:46] <yurikoles> I have run one experiment: installed lucid and tried to upgrade it through all releases with no luck
[07:46] <yurikoles> no
[07:46] <yurikoles> of course no
[07:46] <owen1> is it risky to install 15.04?
[07:46] <yurikoles> do you have a searate /home?
[07:46] <owen1> no
[07:46] <owen1> i don't care about the data
[07:46] <yurikoles> hi, windows7_
[07:47] <yurikoles> but you should care about settings
[07:47] <yurikoles> it's very boring to setup all things again
[07:47] <yurikoles> trust me
[07:47] <windows7_> hi yurikoles
[07:47] <owen1> yurikoles: i have all my settings in a git repo
[07:48] <yurikoles> oh, so you are a haker, doesn't you?
[07:48] <windows7_> what ;setting; owen1
[07:49] <windows7_> better than dropbox right now eh eh eh
[07:50] <yurikoles> you mean git?
[07:50] <yurikoles> google drive is better, but Insync client is very stupid, need to wait for official one
[07:51] <Johnny_Linux> sheesh
[07:51] <Johnny_Linux> google ??
[07:51] <Johnny_Linux> el oh el
[07:52] <yurikoles> you don't like google?
[07:52] <cyberalex4life> yurikoles: to keep your settings from one reinstall to another use a separate home partition that you don't format
[07:52] <yurikoles> thank you
[07:52] <windows7_> is it that simple?
[07:52] <yurikoles> and another one for /etc, yes?
[07:52] <kunji> yes
[07:52] <windows7_> what about apps in /etc/
[07:52] <windows7_> oh
[07:52] <yurikoles> I was first
[07:52] <yurikoles> but no
[07:52] <windows7_> so just those two huh
[07:52] <yurikoles> it will have conflicts
[07:53] <kunji> lol, it's as simple as keeping what you want to keep.  I'll put it that way.
[07:53] <yurikoles> dpkg is alays updating them
[07:53] <yurikoles> and different distros use different paths, and so on
[07:53] <windows7_> yeah
[07:54] <yurikoles> so what is you question, windows7_?
[07:54] <yurikoles> I can try to run ubunut on OSX if you wish
[07:54] <kunji> I would prefer git over google drive though, versioning is nice
[07:54] <owen1> yurikoles: yup. git
[07:54] <owen1> github
[07:54] <yurikoles> even atop of winodws 10 TP
[07:54] <cyberalex4life> yurikoles: Even from a distro to another you can keep program settings. The main settings are in ~/.config/dconf. If you want to reset the settings delete those. If you want to do a partially clean reinstall use the live cd and delete the settings you want to get ridd of
[07:55] <windows7_> i want to connect two VPSes running on VirtualBox on a windows 7 host laptop with 4g ram
[07:55] <windows7_> is that dumb?
[07:55] <yurikoles> of course
[07:55] <kunji> Not necessarily github, you could put it on another machine or yours someplace over ssh.
[07:55] <windows7_> one vps webserver, other vps = database
[07:55] <yurikoles> do you have network set up as bridged?
[07:55] <windows7_> *ifconfing*
[07:55] <windows7_> i dont know
[07:56] <yurikoles> I know about settings, it was not my question
[07:56] <yurikoles> I mean in virtualbox
[07:56] <windows7_> no
[07:56] <windows7_> its running nat
[07:56] <windows7_> im on the first box now
[07:56] <windows7_> i havent created the second yet
[07:57] <yurikoles> so first you need to enable bridging in machine settings
[07:57] <windows7_> just updating some conf on the first box now
[07:57] <yurikoles> but shutdown before that
[07:57] <windows7_> hm ok
[07:57] <windows7_> brb
[08:01] <windows7_> so yurikoles
[08:01] <windows7_> my connection is bridged
[08:02] <yurikoles> ok
[08:02] <yurikoles> try to ping it from cmd on win
[08:04] <windows7_> would it be a subnet like 192.168.0.15?
[08:04] <SohamG> Please can someone give me the command for installing unity over gnome in 14.04? I found this "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop ubuntu-session unity-control-center unity-settings-daemon xul-ext-webaccounts". Is it correct?
[08:05] <Ben64> SohamG: just ubuntu-desktop should pull in everything required
[08:05] <windows7_> SohamG: or have you tried apt-get install unity?
[08:05] <SohamG> Havent tried anything yet...
[08:06] <SohamG> And whats the command for getting rid of gnome/gnome shell after installation of unity?
[08:06] <windows7_> well try what i said first because its quicker
[08:06] <windows7_> then do what Ben64 said
[08:06] <windows7_> or just do the thing you think might work

[08:07]  * phix breaks open the popcorn and takes a seat
[08:08] <SohamG> Whats the command for removing gnome?
[08:08] <phix> SohamG: I would like to know the command to get rid of unity, it is a PITA
[08:09] <windows7_> apt-get remove unity
[08:09] <windows7_> bam hish
[08:09] <Ben64> SohamG: thats a harder question
[08:09] <windows7_> apt-get remove gnome
[08:09] <Ben64> don't do that ^
[08:09] <windows7_> lol
[08:09] <windows7_> do it
[08:09] <SohamG> gnome or gnome shell?
[08:09] <phix> haha
[08:09] <Ben64> unity requires gnome
[08:09] <windows7_> because unity is a PITA
[08:10] <phix> I like gnome
[08:10] <windows7_> and it requires gnome
[08:10] <windows7_> to do that
[08:10] <phix> what is the gnome replacement to unity package called again?
[08:10] <windows7_> because its shit, on top of gnome
[08:10] <phix> Does unity work under KDE?
[08:10] <Ben64> windows7_: the language is not necessary here
[08:10] <windows7_> Ben64: sorry man
[08:11] <windows7_> its late
[08:11] <windows7_> i need to hook up these boxes
[08:11] <cyberalex4life> windows7_: to remove unity you could try sudo apt-get autoremove unity ubuntu-desktop lightdm
[08:12] <cyberalex4life> but it's not necessary safe. You may end up loosing things you don't want to loose

[08:42] <yurikoles_> ?
[08:43] <yurikoles_> it's started a week ago, man. there will be mass rebuild for gcc5, it's bad idea to run it now

[08:48] <yurikoles_> also, don't use networkmanager stuff
[08:48] <justgreg> what should I use?
[08:49] <yurikoles_> for ethernet /etc/network/interfaces is enough

[09:05] <SCHAAP137> have you even tried googling?
[09:05] <SCHAAP137> 1st hit
[09:06] <frank1e> SCHAAP137, Yes, I have tried and found multiple tutorials which ended with basicly nothing because outdated, not working etc.
[09:06] <SCHAAP137> frank1e, try: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
[09:06] <SCHAAP137> then sudo apt-get update
[09:06] <SCHAAP137> sudo apt-get install bitcoin-qt
[09:07] <frank1e> SCHAAP137, already done, no result.
[09:07] <lotuspsychje> kevindf: maybe the #ubuntu-server or ##networking guys can also help you?
[09:07] <frank1e> have downloaded it manually now. but installing -still- needs libdb
[09:08] <lotuspsychje> frank1e: as llutz suggested, you need to know wich lib
[09:08] <frank1e> terminal only says that "libdb" is needed. nothing more.
=== baldrick is now known as Guest94669
[09:08] <frank1e> no version or anything.
[09:08] <frank1e> ----> no idea which version it needs.
[09:08] <SCHAAP137> you're trying to compile it from source?
[09:09] <frank1e> no
[09:09] <kevindf> will ask it there, thanks
[09:09] <frank1e> just install the package I downloaded SCHAAP137
[09:09] <mvk> i've installed a newer kernel (v4.02 on vivid 15.04), with dpkg -i ......
[09:09] <SCHAAP137> frank1e, you could try installing libdb5.3 first, then retry
[09:09] <mvk> do i have to worry for kernel updates from the official repos?
[09:09] <frank1e> SCHAAP137, ok wait

[09:10] <llutz> frank1e: you downloaded the .deb from the ppa? use libdb4.8 then
[09:10] <frank1e> llutz whats the exact command for that pleaser
[09:10] <llutz> frank1e: "man  apt-get"

[09:11] <mvk> lotuspsychje: i did install a newer mailine kernel yes
[09:11] <mvk> so does that mean i dont have to worry for updates?
[09:11] <OERIAS> ^^ Gnome chess looks like gnome app with window controls
[09:11] <OERIAS> from gnome

[09:14] <yurikoles_> mainline has no ppa
[09:15] <yurikoles_> if thre will be exploit, then you know...
[09:15] <DedSec> Hello People :)
[09:15] <mvk> yurikoles_: i installed 4.02 from http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.0.2-wily/
[09:15] <lotuspsychje> DedSec: welcome
[09:15] <mvk> yurikoles_: when there are updates to the kernel in the official ppa / repos, will this overwrite my 4.02 (i want to keep 4.02...)
[09:16] <mvk> ?
[09:16] <DedSec> Thank you
[09:16] <yurikoles_> it will alway boot the latest one
[09:16] <mvk> what defines this?
[09:16] <mvk> isnt that grub?
[09:17] <yurikoles_> yes, ubuntu's grub script
[09:17] <frank1e> llutz libdb is now installed. But the installation still fails. Can't even see any errors in the terminal log that make any sense
[09:17] <mvk> ok, well in case it somehow does install a new kernel and changes my default -> i can always change it back
[09:17] <mvk> but i trust on you :))) :D
[09:17] <Ben64> mvk: is there a reason you don't want to use the normal kernel
[09:18] <yurikoles_> it's better to use xorg-edgers
[09:18] <mvk> Ben64: rtl8192ee works horrible (especially with the 3.19's)
[09:18] <frank1e> I install my packages like this: sudo dpkg -i bitcoin-qt_0.10.1-trusty3_amd64.deb  <--- is that right? because it always ends up failing with the installation via terminal
[09:18] <yurikoles_> it will have new kernel if needed
[09:18] <yurikoles_> what version of ubuntu is your system based on?
[09:18] <mvk> got it working ok now, out of the box, without changes (although i needed to add some systemd scripts for suspend/resume)
[09:19] <lotuspsychje> frank1e: this is just why elementary and ubuntu have seperate channels
[09:19] <Ben64> ah ok, well whenever a kernel update comes out, you should install a new one anyway
[09:19] <Ben64> mvk: ^
[09:19] <lotuspsychje> frank1e: try ubuntu and bitcoin-qt perhaps
[09:20] <lotuspsychje> mvk: have you tryed updating drivers/firmware for your rtl device?
[09:20] <mvk> Ben64: i think it will take a while before 4.0 comes to 15.04 ;-)
[09:20] <mvk> lotuspsychje: yes, yes
[09:21] <Ben64> mvk: i just mean, if theres an update to 15.04's kernel, that means theres something that got fixed, so you should grab a new 4.0 with that fix
[09:21] <llutz> frank1e: "dpkg -I bitcoin-qt_0.10.1-trusty3_amd64.deb"    -"uppercase i"    to get a list of dependencies
[09:21] <mvk> lotuspsychje: realtek provided (what a horrible company btw), a firmware bin in januari, but it still doesnt work well
[09:21] <yurikoles_> frank1e: ehttp://www.distrogeeks.com/install-bitcoin-qt-ubuntu/
[09:21] <mvk> NetworkManager is buggy in 15.04 thats a known problem, check launchpad
[09:22] <mvk> but together with 3.19 and a realtek 8192ee => HORROR
[09:22] <yurikoles_> mvk: you will need to go to web and download a couple of files, dpkg -i theme
[09:22] <yurikoles_> it's boring
[09:22] <yurikoles_> try to find some ppa
[09:22] <lotuspsychje> mvk: if you want more stable goto LTS perhaps
[09:22] <wangchaohui> hello world
[09:23] <yurikoles_> another news about nm in 15.04
[09:23] <mvk> lotuspsychje: my system is working 100% fine with 4.02 (i have one PCC error on boot, but thats only informational)
[09:24] <yurikoles_> I had heard 3 times in this channel about networking problems today
[09:24] <Kartagis> anyone using cairo-dock?
[09:24] <mvk> so i want to stick to it (thinkpad: t440s)
[09:24] <Kartagis> yurikoles_: wanna  hear a 4th time?
[09:24] <lotuspsychje> mvk: as Ben64 said, if kernel gets an update, youll have to update it for security reasons
[09:25] <lotuspsychje> mvk: but its your choice of course, to use the best working kernel as long as you need
[09:25] <mvk> yurikoles_: nm is broken > 650 bugs.. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager
[09:25] <lotuspsychje> Kartagis: ask your question about cairo
[09:26] <yurikoles_> that's why I use networkd on my arch
[09:26] <yurikoles_> and used just dhcp before
[09:27] <Kartagis> lotuspsychje: I just wanted to know if anyone  is getting their icons die and show question marks instead

[10:30] <MonkeyDust> kibMaf  is that a server? if yes, there's also #ubuntu-server
[10:31] <kibMaf> no, it's desktop PC
[10:34] <kutunluu> Is there a way to install server to a machine without keyboard and monitor ?
[10:34] <kutunluu> i have physical access, same network etc.

[10:36] <kutunluu> lol
[10:36] <katherine> uh ..
[10:37] <robhol> forgot sudo
[10:37] <LeMike> some command is responsible for giving a ext4 filesystem a label. how am I supposed to find such commands without internet? `man -k disk label` does not bring up `tune2fs` which can do it :/ what is a neat way to search within the manual/help? grepping "/usr/share/man" has no output at all -.-
[10:38] <MonkeyDust> LeMike  man man
[10:41] <MonkeyDust> LeMike  if you look for something inside a man page, use a forward slash, like   /somewordhere
[10:41] <llutz> LeMike: e2label
[10:42] <kunji> LeMike: if you have gparted installed you can assign a label in that and watch the output.  But I think llutz just gave it to you anyway.
[10:42] <llutz> LeMike: "man -k label"
[10:43] <llutz> LeMike:  zgrep -r  ....    /usr/share/man/*      man-pages are mostly gzipped
[10:47] <MonkeyDust> kutunluu  just noticed, the ssh hint was for you, not for katherine
[10:48] <kutunluu> MonkeyDust, thanks, i am reading on ubuntu web now :P
[10:48] <LeMike> thanks MonkeyDust . sorry kunji the thing is that I like to know `man` better - once a week I work without any internet for practice. as llutz said using `zgrep LABEL $(find)` could bring it up when searching in the correct directory (zgrep has no recursion) ;) thanks!
[10:49] <kunji> LeMike: Ah, sorry, I didn't realize the objective here, and didn't know that anyway, I also learned something ^_^

[11:11] <longgoodbye> llutz i'm completly lost here. even if I try to add more repos, theadd-apt-repository does not work.
[11:11] <longgoodbye> its the first time this hapens on me. this is a diferent vps provider so I was thinking on some problem with the template they install or something.
[11:12] <bekks> longgoodbye: So pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list please.
[11:12] <bekks> Along with cat /etc/issue
[11:13] <longgoodbye> here you go bekks http://paste.ubuntu.com/11184579/

[11:15] <longgoodbye> http://paste.ubuntu.com/11184618/
[11:15] <longgoodbye> weird, not it says that python-software-properties is already the newest version.
[11:16] <bekks> longgoodbye: So add-apt-repository is already installed. Whats the exact issue now?
[11:16] <longgoodbye> but I'm still unable to use the add-apt-repository
[11:16] <bekks> Why?
[11:16] <longgoodbye> because: -bash: add-apt-repository: command not found
[11:17] <longgoodbye> and that problem is the one I've been searching all morning for it.
[11:17] <longgoodbye> *for thye solution
[11:17] <longgoodbye> *the
[11:17] <longgoodbye> damn keyboard :/
[11:18] <bekks> longgoodbye: Did you try reinstalling that package?
[11:18] <longgoodbye> the python-software-properties ?
[11:18] <bekks> longgoodbye: Yes.
[11:19] <metallic> What does exactly longgoodbye wants? sorry I disconnected to try a thing :)
[11:19] <metallic> want*
[11:19] <metallic> being capable of using the "add-apt-repository" command?
[11:20] <longgoodbye> try that just now. remove, then install. add-apt-repository does not work.
[11:20] <bekks> "does not work" is misleading. It tells you that the command is not found.
[11:20] <longgoodbye> metallic yeah
[11:20] <longgoodbye> -bash: add-apt-repository: command not found
[11:20] <longgoodbye> does not "just" work as it should :p
[11:20] <metallic> longgoodbye: have you tried adding repositories  by directly editing the /etc/apt/sourcelist file?
[11:21] <longgoodbye> nop
[11:21] <bekks> metallic: http://paste.ubuntu.com/11184579/
[11:21] <metallic> since the add-apt thing is not working... It would be a nice idea
[11:21] <longgoodbye> btw, my main goal is to install x2go on this vps
[11:22] <longgoodbye> thats why I need to use that command
[11:22] <longgoodbye> but one problem at the time :p I'm sure I can install it by myself... after dealing with this  problem.
[11:23] <bekks> longgoodbye: So did you reinstall the package now?
[11:23] <longgoodbye> a few mins ago
[11:23] <longgoodbye> and its still the same not found error
[11:24] <bekks> longgoodbye: So run "hash -r" and "which add-apt-repository"
[11:24] <longgoodbye> run both. still command not found
[11:25] <metallic> my add-apt-repository is located at /usr/bin/ :/
[11:25] <longgoodbye> even if I add it on sources.list manualy I dont know how to add the ppa:x2go/stable
[11:25] <bekks> longgoodbye: Whats the output of /usr/bin/add-apt-repository ?
[11:25] <bekks> "ls -lha /usr/bin/add-apt-repository"
[11:26] <longgoodbye> -bash: /usr/bin/add-apt-repository: No such file or directory
[11:26] <metallic> that is sure weird
[11:26] <longgoodbye> ls: cannot access /usr/bin/add-apt-repository: No such file or directory
[11:26] <longgoodbye> yeah... 1 hour weird of hassle. :/
[11:26] <bekks> And whats the entire output of "sudo apt-get purge python-software-properties; sudo apt-get install python-software-porperties"?

[11:30] <longgoodbye> this just dosnt make sense :s
[11:30] <metallic> maybe longgoodbye should try python3-software-properties
[11:31] <longgoodbye> oh waittt
[11:31] <longgoodbye> got it
[11:31] <longgoodbye> metallic solution worked
[11:31] <longgoodbye> not the 3
[11:31] <aquaguy> http://paste.ubuntu.com/11184895/
[11:31] <longgoodbye> but one of those there
[11:32] <metallic> longgoodbye: do you mean that you are able to execute "add-apt-repository"?
[11:32] <Fjorgynn> aquaguy: so you are connected that's good
[11:32] <bekks> longgoodbye: Install: software-properties-common
[11:32] <longgoodbye> metallic yes it does
[11:32] <metallic> nice!
[11:33] <aquaguy> Fjorgynn: yes, but I can reach local network computers, the ping always returns Host unreachable
[11:33] <longgoodbye> I allready have that bekks
[11:33] <bekks> longgoodbye: according to packages.ubuntu.com, python-software-properties and python3-software-properties are the same package.
[11:33] <longgoodbye> I?m allmost sure I can finish x2go instalation now
[11:33] <aquaguy> or doesn't output anything at all
[11:33] <longgoodbye> I fix it using the sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
[11:33] <longgoodbye> not the python3 one
[11:34] <longgoodbye> thank you both for your help guys.
[11:34] <metallic> longgoodbye: remember that "ask Ubuntu" is a good place to look for questions :)
[11:34] <Fjorgynn> aquaguy: some sort of dhcp problem?
[11:34] <MonkeyDust> longgoodbye  that was quite entertaining, glad you found it
[11:36] <longgoodbye> metallic I've been there but I did not find that post at first glance. :)

[11:37] <Flo_K> hello
[11:41] <irisk> hello, the icon for connecting to a network is not appearing in the title bar, can anyone help?
[11:42] <EriC^> irisk: type nm-applet &
[11:42] <irisk> with the "&" ?
[11:42] <EriC^> yeah
[11:42] <EriC^> then type exit
[11:42] <irisk> yes it has appeared
[11:43] <EriC^> ok, type exit
[11:43] <irisk> but do I have to do this everytime?
[11:43] <irisk> is this bug or sth?
[11:43] <EriC^> no, it should appear by itself
[11:43] <irisk> well, when i start my computer it does
[11:43] <irisk> but after a minute or so, it disappears
[11:44] <EriC^> that's odd
[11:44] <irisk> it's probably cos i'm on 15.04
[11:44] <EriC^> even so that shouldn't happen
[11:44] <irisk> non LTS <sheepish grin>
[11:45] <EriC^> check /var/log/syslog for any segfaults or errors when it happens
[11:45] <irisk> well if it interests you
[11:45] <irisk> i get a couple of errors
[11:45] <irisk> when i did nm-applet
[11:45] <irisk> (nm-applet:14956): Gtk-WARNING **: Theme parsing error: gtk-widgets.css:2:16: Theming engine 'adwaita' not found
[11:45] <EriC^> type grep -A10 nm-applet /var/log/syslog | nc termbin.com 9999
[11:46] <irisk> http://termbin.com/9x9e
[11:47] <EriC^> try dmesg | grep nm-applet | nc termbin.com 9999
[11:48] <irisk> "Use netcat"
[11:48] <EriC^> try dmesg | grep nm-applet |& curl -F "sprunge=<-" sprunge.us
[11:48] <irisk> EriC^: i think it's because i'm using a non-stable theme
[11:49] <irisk> did you see the link?
[11:49] <irisk> above?
[11:49] <EriC^> irisk: yeah those aren't major errors though
[11:49] <EriC^> and they are from couple minutes ago
[11:50] <EriC^> try the dmesg command, maybe it has more info
[11:50] <irisk> try command not found
[11:50] <EriC^> dmesg | grep nm-applet |& curl -F "sprunge=<-" sprunge.us
[11:50] <irisk> http://sprunge.us/HhOY
[11:50] <EriC^> ok
[11:50] <irisk> empty
[11:51] <EriC^> ok, next time when it crashes check dmesg or /var/log/syslog
[11:51] <irisk> will do
[11:51] <irisk> that last command ?
[11:51] <EriC^> or you could try running it from a terminal and keeping it open so it might say why it crashed
[11:51] <irisk> dmesg | grep nm-applet |& curl -F "sprunge=<-" sprunge.u ?
[11:52] <EriC^> irisk: just type dmesg alone and take a look at it
[11:52] <irisk> ok thanks
[11:53] <EriC^> irisk: or type less /var/log/syslog to view the syslog
[11:53] <EriC^> less /var/log/syslog
[11:53] <irisk> coolio
[11:54] <irisk> and by the way, is there no way to connect to a network without using that applet?
[11:54] <irisk> i hunted around but i couldn't find a "connect to this network" anywhere

[11:55] <irisk> hmm okay
[11:56] <EriC^> nm-connection-editor too
[11:56] <fxmulder> so I have ubuntu desktop running in a virtual machine and when I pull up the vm console the desktop takes up about 80% of the width and then starts repeating, why would it do that?
[11:56] <EriC^> to add stuff
[11:56] <irisk> yes, i found that - but in the end i had to turn on autoconnect
[11:57] <EriC^> irisk: there's nmcli but it's dreadful
[11:58] <EriC^> i guess once you know how to use it it's better, i've never really gave it much interest

[12:09] <rainbowwarrior> BluesKaj let me look
[12:10] <rainbowwarrior> BluesKaj :- yes
[12:11] <mac11> Hi
[12:13] <BluesKaj> rainbowwarrior, is the vpnserver/provider for home use or a production machine?
[12:13] <dengxinjun> helloworld
[12:14] <dengxinjun> I writing code
[12:14] <MonkeyDust> dengxinjun  nice, but not here
[12:14] <rainbowwarrior> BluesKaj , home use (its with private internet access )
[12:15] <BluesKaj> rainbowwarrior, PIA ?
[12:16] <rainbowwarrior> BluesKaj , yes
[12:16] <rainbowwarrior> BluesKaj , PIA are my vpn provider
[12:17] <BluesKaj> rainbowwarrior, if it is you have to follow this: https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/#ubuntu_openvpn_installer
[12:18] <dengxinjun> you in ...
[12:18] <rainbowwarrior> BluesKaj ok thank you I will try that
[12:19] <BluesKaj> rainbowwarrior, I use the PIA as well, so if you have any problems I can help
[12:21] <iamrohit7> my isp uses an authentication mechanism, a java servlet and i am required to login everytime i want to connect to the internet using a web browser how do i automate this when i turn on the computer?
[12:23] <Avihay_work__> iamrohit7: there's a project called phantomJS. it runs a headless webkit based browser. I don't know if it supports java-plugins, but if it does, you could set keyboard focus on the applet, and inject the key sequence needed to login
[12:23] <Avihay_work__> also, click events
[12:24] <rainbowwarrior> BluesKaj done that still having problems it not loading any websites
[12:26] <BluesKaj> rainbowwarrior, did it ask for your username and pw when trying to connect?
[12:26] <rainbowwarrior> BluesKaj yes
[12:27] <BluesKaj> and it shows you are connected via vpn in network manager ?
[12:27] <rainbowwarrior> BluesKaj , yes
[12:29] <iamrohit7> Avihay_work__, i was hoping if there was a way to do it with bash or alike
[12:29] <Avihay_work__> iamrohit7: well, theoretically, you only need to send a specific packet
[12:29] <rainbowwarrior> BluesKaj I can connect to the vpn fine and it says connected and get the icon to show its connected to the vpn, but for some reason it is not loading websites
[12:30] <Avihay_work__> or a set of packets
[12:32] <iamrohit7> Avihay_work__, okay...
[12:32] <Avihay_work__> iamrohit7:  mocking around with wireshark (packet-capture) and netcat  wouldn't be much fun, but it's doable, I guess, I mean your ISP probably doesn't bother with encryption...
[12:35] <BluesKaj> rainbowwarrior, ok run this in the console, sudo netstat -tapen, look for "open vpn" and further down " 5096/nm-openvpn-ser " or some such
[12:37] <rainbowwarrior> BluesKaj nothing like that, remember i can't be on chat etc with the vpn all I can do is connect

[13:12] <wakatana> helo
[13:12] <freefen0517> hello, i think i need help with iptables-filtering/forwarding
[13:13] <wakatana> what is the default /etc/apt/sources.list for 13.04 ?
[13:13] <wakatana> I have downloaded preconfigured virtual machine image with this distro but I am not able to do update
[13:13] <wakatana> or install anything
[13:14] <lotuspsychje> wakatana: 13.04 is eol
[13:14] <llutz> wakatana: you'll need to update http://fridge.ubuntu.com/2014/01/28/ubuntu-13-04-raring-ringtail-end-of-life-reached-on-january-27-2014/
[13:14] <llutz> !eol | wakatana
[13:14] <ubottu> wakatana: End-Of-Life is the time when security updates and support for an Ubuntu release stop, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases for more information. Looking to upgrade from an EOL release? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
[13:14] <lotuspsychje> !iptables | freefen0517
[13:14] <ubottu> freefen0517: Ubuntu, like any other Linux distribution, has built-in firewall capabilities. The firewall is managed using the 'ufw' command - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW | GUI frontends such as gufw and ufw-kde also exist. | An alternative to ufw is the 'iptables' command - See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo
[13:16] <wakatana> llutz: I know it is old distro but bascially I need isntall openssh-server and maybe x11vnc server
[13:16] <wakatana> no mater that are old packages
[13:16] <MonkeyDust> wakatana  here are more preconfigured virtual boxes http://www.vagrantbox.es/
[13:16] <wakatana> security does not matter becaue it is only virtual machine and I wont be connected to internet
[13:16] <wakatana> MonkeyDust: I know but this one is specific with one software that I need
[13:16] <wakatana> nupic
[13:17] <MonkeyDust> wakatana  13.04 is dead, as in: not breathing anymore
[13:17] <wakatana> I just want to install ssh server (even old) to old distro nothing more
[13:17] <freefen0517> lotuspsychje, thanks, but i know what iptables is and does
[13:17] <lotuspsychje> freefen0517: then ask your specific issue in channel please
[13:18] <MonkeyDust> wakatana  supported ubuntu releases have ssh too
[13:18] <freefen0517>  running 14.04 as host with bridge. qemu-vm running. vm gets ip from dhcpd from outside the host - so network works more or less. ping/ssh from host to vm works - and back... just not to the outside
[13:19] <freefen0517> how could i debug, whats going wrong?
[13:19] <llutz> freefen0517: enabled ipforwarding on host?
[13:19] <wakatana> MonkeyDust: I do not want to install new release
[13:19] <wakatana> I am aware of all it constraints etc.
[13:19] <MonkeyDust> wakatana  than you cannot ask help here
[13:20] <MonkeyDust> then*
[13:20] <wakatana> this old I am using becauese it is only preconfigured distro from the application mainainer
[13:20] <freefen0517> llutz, this? echo “1” > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
[13:20] <MrElendig> build your own packages
[13:20] <freefen0517> yes, i tried
[13:20] <MrElendig> or get a better host
[13:20] <wakatana> the only thing that I want to access it remote by ssh nothing more nothing less
[13:20] <reddiz> hey ehm, how can I register my account?

[13:21] <reddiz> thanks :)
[13:21] <MonkeyDust> wakatana  ok, use ssh, but don't try to update, because the software source is no longer available
[13:21] <llutz> freefen0517: and a "cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward" returns 1?
[13:22] <dale__> ey
[13:26] <Fjorgynn> ubuntu server is interesting
[13:28] <freefen0517> llutz, yes its 1
[13:29] <Fjorgynn> so the best way to install a minimum Ubuntu system is ubuntu server installation?
[13:29] <llutz> !mini | Fjorgynn
[13:29] <ubottu> Fjorgynn: The Minimal CD image is very small in size, and it downloads most packages from the Internet during installation, allowing you to select only those you want.  The installer is text based (rather than graphical as used on the Desktop DVD). See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[13:30] <Fjorgynn> I din't know that ubuntu still had minimal netinstaller
[13:30] <wakatana> MonkeyDust: This is what I was looking for :) sudo sed -i -e 's/archive.ubuntu.com\|security.ubuntu.com/old-releases.ubuntu.com/g' /etc/apt/sources.list
[13:31] <rainbowwarrior> BluesKaj , I have same problem with the Unity desktop as well, I can connect to the vpn but again can not do anything like visit websites, chat etc
[13:32] <MrElendig> check your routing
[13:32] <freefen0517> MrElendig, i?
[13:32] <MrElendig> asuming you are getting timeouts and not invalid url errors
[13:33] <BluesKaj> rainbowwarrior, do have the skybroadband shield set up on your internet service?

[13:33] <rainbowwarrior> BluesKaj , not that I know of
[13:34] <MrElendig> s/url/resolve/
=== QuantumVacuum is now known as QuantumVacuum-AF
[13:34] <freefen0517> MrElendig, the routing from vm to host is fine... ping/ssh works in both directions. same for the host itself
[13:35] <BluesKaj> rainbowwarrior, i think you had better check it out. It might be in effect by default so you may need to call them to invoke the "negative option" so to speak
[13:35] <freefen0517> MrElendig, just not from vm to outside and back
[13:35] <Fjorgynn> llutz: thank you
[13:36] <freefen0517> but the vm gets its ip from the dhcpd from outside fine
[13:36] <wakatana> Can I somehow tune Unity to run faster I am saving every piece of memory because it is running on older laptom under virtual machine
[13:37] <rainbowwarrior> BluesKaj , Ok will do ty, but I managed to use it on linux mint 17.1 (rebecca) and could visit websites etc, but i did have a problem of it dropping on now and then, so I think you are right
[13:37] <rainbowwarrior> out* not no
[13:37] <rainbowwarrior> not on*

[13:50] <Ubuntivity> teward: that's why we shouldn't be lazy :}
[13:50] <longgoodbye> teward lol I see. so the question is: I ***DID*** install chrome and other apps as root. then I obvious just login as a normal user. I can't install it as the user as I dont have permitions. so what's the catch? :p

[13:51] <kader> hi
[13:51] <Ubuntivity> Hello kader
[13:51] <teward> longgoodbye: you can only install software as superuser.  you can't make Chrome work if it's saying operation not permitted.  i'm not a chrome expert but you could consider googling the specific error you have to try and see if anyone else has seen the problem.

[13:56] <MrElendig> good
[13:58] <teward> ubuntuser13: I don't think that's an Ubuntu problem, since the issue is how Windows interprets the text.

[15:16] <camsn0w> eww outlook
[15:17] <HedgeMage> camsn0w: Whatever terminal emulator you use has color settings (so does your actual shell, but it sounds like you are concerned with behavior in X, not at the console)
[15:17] <camsn0w> I use gnome-terminal and termanator
[15:17] <HedgeMage> camsn0w: I've been in xfce4-terminal forever despite not using xfce4, as it "just works" for the various things I do with minimal (usually zero) fuss.

=== cattata1056 is now known as cattytatty
[17:31] <Senjai> Hello. I was trying to upgrade from 13.10 to 15.04. I did so with a live USB. I selected the upgrade option. And the UEFI boot setting. On boot I got a grub missing symbol error and was thrown into grub rescue.
[17:32] <Senjai> I rebooted again to get into bios
[17:32] <TechChristoph> well sometimes i must install software on them which are on others computers mainly on my laptop
[17:32] <Nubuntoo> I don't think specs is the problem, it's a dual core with 1gb of ram, which is above minimum spec I think
[17:32] <Senjai> But no bios showed up, and no boot
[17:32] <Senjai> Any ideas?
=== cattytatty is now known as cattata1056
[17:32] <Senjai> Just a black screen. I can't figure out how to get into the BIOS
[17:32] <islandmonkeee> digitsm: What js your computer? Does it have one of those dreaded combo mics, where the output and input jack is crammed into one?
[17:32] <bekks> Senjai: you need to update to 14.04, then 14.10, then 15.04 - you cannot update directly.
[17:32] <TechChristoph> OerHeks: for now i have a script on a usb-stick which installs all the software
[17:32] <TechChristoph> on the stick is a python-script which does that for me
[17:32] <Senjai> bekks: Alright, so my issue here, is that I cannot get into my bios now at all.. That's the problem I'm currently trying to cover
[17:33] <islandmonkeee> digitsm: Combo jacks* sorry
[17:33] <TechChristoph> but can i do this over the network ?
[17:33] <TechChristoph> not just with the stick
[17:33] <Senjai> bekks: I can just do a fresh install, and that's fine. But I kinda need a boot menu to do so
[17:33] <digitsm> islandmonkeee, My laptop is an old Dell Latitude D-830 (7 years old). It has separate jacks for input and output
[17:33] <ioria> Nubuntoo, it's 32 or 64 ?
[17:33] <bekks> Senjai: Well, then you need to find out on how to get into the bios, by looking it up in the manual of your computer/mainboard. Thats nothing Ubuntu can help you with.
[17:33] <Nubuntoo> 64 athlon
[17:33] <Senjai> bekks: It stopped working after the ubuntu install. My bios key is F2
[17:34] <Senjai> But it seems to skip the BIOS now after the install
[17:34] <bekks> Senjai: Ubuntu doesnt alter the BIOS at all.
[17:34] <ioria> Nubuntoo, it's dual core that ?
[17:35] <Nubuntoo> Yes
[17:35] <OerHeks> TechChristoph, sure you can build a deb from a pythonscript on launchpad, but it would not be usefull for other servers i guess.
[17:35] <digitsm> islandmonkeee, Unfortunately any microphone is unavailable in audio settings: http://oi57.tinypic.com/xatc0l.jpg
[17:35] <TechChristoph> OerHeks: ok many thanks so far :-)
[17:36] <Nubuntoo> If you know a place that explains how to debug the initramfs mounting from busybox I could tinker around a bit
[17:39] <ioria> Nubuntoo, well, i think that 'google is your friend', but you could try Lubuntu with no harm, in the meanwhile
[17:39] <TechChristoph> Nubuntoo: i use lubuntu on my laptop
[17:39] <TechChristoph> with a 3.19 kernel
[17:40] <Nubuntoo> Since its so early in the boot process I kind of wonder if lubuntu helps, doesn't it boot in a similar way?
[17:40] <TechChristoph> it boots just like ubuntu
[17:40] <TechChristoph> its just lighter
[17:40] <ioria> Nubuntoo, another reason to try , i guess
[17:41] <TechChristoph> but if you are fan of the commandline
[17:41] <owen1> when i type sh i see: E: no packages found.   any tips?
[17:41] <TechChristoph> then maybe not
[17:41] <bekks> owen1: whats the purpose of typing "sh"?
[17:41] <owen1> bekks: installing docker - wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh
[17:41] <ioria> Nubuntoo, you can use linuxpendrive for the stick
[17:41] <goju> My CMOS clock is running slow but how Ubuntu clock is showing the correct time ?
[17:42] <bekks> owen1: And whats the entire output of that command?
[17:42] <owen1> bekks: E: No packages found
[17:42] <Nubuntoo> I don't have a stick for this, so we havea bout 8 DVDs worth of distro to try left :p
[17:42] <bekks> owen1: Do you have wget installed? :)
[17:42] <TechChristoph> no stick ?
[17:42] <TechChristoph> mhm
[17:42] <owen1> bekks: which wget => /usr/bin/wget
[17:43] <bekks> owen1: And whats the output of "which sh"?
[17:43] <TechChristoph> sh is the shell
[17:43] <owen1> bekks: /bin/sh
[17:43] <bekks> owen1: So it exists. :)
[17:43] <owen1> yup
[17:43] <bekks> TechChristoph: sh is one shell, not the shell :)
[17:43] <owen1> maybe i need to be sudo
[17:43] <owen1> 1 sec
[17:43] <bekks> owen1: No.
[17:43] <ioria> Nubuntoo, you meant Athlon 64 X2, i got it
[17:43] <owen1> bekks: works now!
[17:44] <owen1> sudo su
[17:44] <bekks> sudo su is crap.
[17:44] <Nubuntoo> Yes ioria
[17:44] <bekks> Either use sudo, or sudo -i, but sudo su is just nonsense.
[17:44] <netameta> How can i copy everything from a folder to another ?
[17:45] <netameta> so say i am at var/www/folderOne, and i want to copy the content of var/www/folderTwo
[17:45] <owen1> bekks: interesting. what is the difference between sudo su and sudo -i
[17:46] <bekks> owen1: sudo su is nonsense, sudo -i provides you a login shell with root privileges.
[17:46] <Nubuntoo> I'm going to try to get busybox to list my fs dev state and get a screenshot for you guys
[17:46] <bekks> owen1: sudo su executes su with root privileges to get you a shell implicitely.
[17:47] <owen1> bekks: and sudo -i?

[17:48] <owen1> bekks: oh. sorry!
[17:49] <owen1> bekks: i am still not sure why the 'implicit shell' is an issue
[17:50] <owen1> so far i did stuff with sudo su with no issues.
[17:50] <owen1> unless there are security concerns i should be aware of
[17:50] <bekks> owen1: generally you just want to use "sudo".
[17:50] <kokut> Hello, anyone knows how to configure an usb wifi transciever?
[17:51] <kokut> transceiver*
[17:51] <bekks> owen1: sudo su starts a su as root to give you a root shell. Same thing as just running sudo -i, or even shorter, sudo yourcommand, to execute yourcommand as root.
[17:52] <owen1> bekks: got it
[17:52] <OerHeks> kokut, plug it in and see if it showes up in networkmanager, if not, open the restricted drivers tool to see if a driver shows up, that can take a minute.
[17:53] <kokut> OerHeks: what do you mean restricted drivers?

[18:06] <punjabidon> anyone have any idea?
[18:06] <punjabidon> currently running noeveau graphic drivers
[18:06] <Eddi> you should download driver suitable to your card from the official site and install it.
[18:06] <Chocolateraineu> it's quite an old card, does amdconfig supports old ones?

[18:06] <ubottu> Chocolateraineu: For Ati/NVidia/Matrox video cards, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VideoDriverHowto

[18:08] <_Rarity> Hello. Is it possible to prevent a kernel module from updating on apt-get upgrade?
[18:09] <bekks> _Rarity: you can pin it, but that will break if you are updating the kernel.
[18:09] <bekks> _Rarity: Which module on which kernel on which Ubuntu? :)
[18:09] <kokut> so i just sudo make in the folder with the MakeFile and now what?
=== evandro is now known as Guest13638
[18:11] <_Rarity> bekks: The hid_apple module on Ubuntu 14.04, kernel: 3.13.0-52 generic. The module is only slightly changes, so it should work on almost all kernels
[18:12] <Phosis> When bash scripting is there a system call where, upon loading up the program in the script, the script running in the background ends and the user is brought back to to a command prompt?
[18:12] <_Rarity> bekks: It is just slightly annoying to have to load it every time I upgrade the kernel. (I know, it is a first world problem :P ...)
=== evandro_ is now known as Guest31227
[18:12] <Phosis> I have a script that is a menu option for running a game. But when I exit the game, I want the script to stop running.
[18:13] <bekks> _Rarity: It will not work on other kernels, since the version of the kernel changes. You have to rebuild it every time.
[18:13] <Chocolateraineu> bekks: Oh hell no, my days of fighting with xorg.conf are over haha maybe it's a faulty install, will test with others USB. Bye peeps
[18:13] <cattata1056> kill the process Phosis
[18:13] <Phosis> but if I kill the process in the script, won't the game immediately close also?
[18:13] <SchrodingersScat> Phosis: break could work if it's in a loop, can also try exit
[18:13] <bekks> Chocolateraineu: Reinstalling will not fix it.
[18:13] <bekks> Chocolateraineu: Reading how to fix it will.
[18:14] <Phosis> BREAK!
[18:14] <Phosis> Break worked
[18:14] <Chocolateraineu> bekks: Let's agree to disagree
[18:14] <Phosis> thank you!
[18:14] <SchrodingersScat> Phosis: welcome, have fun
[18:14] <punjabidon> suspend not working
[18:14] <punjabidon> anyone have any ideas?
[18:14] <_Rarity> bekks: Oh. I figured the module would work on different versions of the kernel, since it is a keyboard module that has (almost) nothing to do with the kernel itself
[18:14] <_Rarity> bekks: Thanks anyways
[18:14] <bekks> Chocolateraineu: I'm agreeing to just ignore your future issues with that install :)
[18:15] <bekks> _Rarity: technically, nothing changes in the module. But the version of the kernel it is linked again changes, so you have to reinstall it every time.

[18:31] <bubben> ..
[18:31]  * wesley9946 asks the same as teward
[18:31] <feneco_> whats the lightest ubuntu variant at the moment?
[18:31] <wesley9946> lubuntu

[18:36] <econdudeawesome> Howdy all! Trying to get my fstab to work right, and am super unfamiliar with the options. I have a vfat partition that is being mounted, and plex won't read. What I would like to do is mount it to a specific user (me) instead of root (as is the case for the "defaults" option in fstab). Any suggestions or pointers?

[19:42] <telmac> about what?

[19:45] <Dr-007> my ubuntu seems to get confused what network card it should use to reach the internet
[19:46] <Dr-007> ip route has: default via 192.168.37.2 dev eth0
[19:46] <Dr-007> what else could "screw" it up?

[19:46] <daftykins> Dr-007: is this a desktop install of ubuntu with network manager handling the network connections?
[19:47] <Pricey> What's the difference between nvidia-331 & nvidia-331-updates ?
[19:47] <Dr-007> daftykins, no. its a cli server ubuntu. where i'm editting the /etc/network/interfaces
[19:47] <Dr-007> ive made eth1 "dumb"
[19:47] <Dr-007> by disabling everything
[19:47] <daftykins> can you share your file?
[19:47] <Dr-007> but still. when i try to ping google.com it takes linux a while to figure out which ethernet card it should use
[19:47] <bekks> Pricey: The latter receives updates, the former doesnt.
[19:48] <Dr-007> daftykins, sure. let me upload it somewhere
[19:48] <daftykins> Dr-007: paste.ubuntu.com is ace
[19:48] <Pricey> bekks: Odd, do you know why?
[19:48] <daftykins> Dr-007: you should only have one default gateway so i don't see why it'd take time
[19:49] <d3ad7rack> Dr-007 what's your routing table look like?
[19:49] <bekks> Pricey: The answer to the this askubuntu question explains it in detail: http://askubuntu.com/questions/363835/nvidia-304-updates-vs-nvidia-304-and-similar
[19:49] <Pricey> bekks: Fantastic, thanks.

[19:51] <punjabidon> suspend not working
[19:51] <punjabidon> any possible reasons?
[19:51] <Dr-007> daftykins, http://paste.ubuntu.com/11192646/
[19:52] <Dr-007> ./etc/network/interfaces eth1 is now currently disabled and it still takes a while for the first ping to appear on the screen
[19:52] <telmac> was the feature removed from ubuntu to log into a session of a different WM?
[19:53] <daftykins> Dr-007: your router is seriously .2 ?
[19:53] <daftykins> telmac: no you must not have it installed correctly if it is not presented
[19:53] <telmac> do I need to do more than apt-get install i3?
[19:54] <telmac> (that's my wm)
[19:54] <telmac> I installed totally stock standard ubuntu
[19:54] <daftykins> i don't have a clue about i3.
[19:54] <Dr-007> daftykins, it actually is a virtual machine. but that ip is correct. yes
[19:54] <telmac> well it's unity's problem not i3's
[19:54] <telmac> also btw nouveau keeps crashing when I start ff
[19:54] <daftykins> telmac: no it's likely an issue with you not installing the requisite packages to provide an i3 session
[19:54] <daftykins> which is what lightdm would look at in order to offer the alternative :)
[19:54] <telmac> daftykins: let me present my problem different
[19:55] <telmac> a. fuck compiz
[19:55] <telmac> b. fuck unity
[19:55] <HedgeMage> telmac: if you don't get it solved by the time I'm back from afk, I can go find my ubuntu laptop and help debug (I'm a i3 user)
[19:55] <bekks> c. watch your language.
[19:55] <daftykins> !language | telmac Congratulations you're now getting ignored :)
[19:55] <ubottu> telmac Congratulations you're now getting ignored :): The main Ubuntu channels require that you speak in calm, polite English. For other languages, please visit https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/ChannelList
[19:55] <telmac> c. how can I get ubuntu to boot into a shell and allow me to log in from VT2?
[19:55] <telmac> ?
[19:55] <d3ad7rack> •telmac• recovery mode should allow for that
[19:56] <telmac> I mean, I want that normally
[19:56] <daftykins> Dr-007: what's the tap interface for?
[19:56] <telmac> I had that on debian, boot into a shell and then start x manually
[19:56] <Dr-007> openvpn
[19:57] <daftykins> Dr-007: tried configuring your eth0 statically? seems it'd make sense regardless of how it'd impact the problem
[19:57] <Flannel> telmac: If you're looking for a minimal install, it's usually easier to build up from a command-line only install, rather than peel away all of the extra GUI stuff.  You can use the server CD or the minimal CD to do so.
[19:57] <Dr-007> daftykins, i did not. good one. i will try this
[19:58] <pavlos> telmac, change the /etc/default/grub from quiet splash to text
[19:58] <pavlos> telmac, and update-grub
[19:58] <telmac> Flannel: canonical used to distribute a "mini.iso"
[19:58] <daftykins> still do
[19:58] <daftykins> !mini
[19:58] <ubottu> The Minimal CD image is very small in size, and it downloads most packages from the Internet during installation, allowing you to select only those you want.  The installer is text based (rather than graphical as used on the Desktop DVD). See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[19:58] <telmac> which I looked for but could not find for 15.5
[19:58] <Flannel> telmac: They still do.
[19:58] <telmac> *.4
[19:59] <Flannel> telmac: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[19:59] <telmac> okay well that's much better

[20:02] <daftykins> mebus: run a "sudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get update" just to double check

[20:03] <mebus> the url is wrong

[20:08] <mebus> sorry.

[20:08] <crzdcarney> Hey i have a question.  I installed Linux, encrypted the entire drive, it automatically made a 32 gb swap partition.  Would it be easier to just backup everything, reinstall, set the correct swap partition size, then reload the data from the backup?  or can i some how resize the swap even though its encrypted?
[20:09] <guntbert> Flannel: never seen before - sorry :-)
[20:09] <HedgeMage> crzdcarney: assuming a standard LUKS+LVM2 setup, you can safely resize.  However, keep in mind that if you want suspend-to-disk functionality, your swap must be a bit bigger than your RAM total.
[20:10] <Raeth> Hello. I tried out Unity for the first time today and have set the dock to auto-hide, however I cannot push it open with my tablet, only the mouse. Does anyone know of this problem?
[20:10] <crzdcarney> I have 32 gb of ram
[20:10] <crzdcarney> I wanted to shrink it down to 4 gb ... is that a bad idea?
[20:10] <HedgeMage> crzdcarney: Then if you shrink your SWAP, you may lose suspend-to-disk capability (depending on how full your RAM is when you suspend).
[20:11] <crzdcarney> can i disable suspend to disk?
[20:11] <crzdcarney> i am guessing suspend to disk is the same as hibernate?
[20:11] <crzdcarney> sorry i am new to linux
[20:11] <HedgeMage> yes, suspend-to-disk is hibernate
[20:12] <HedgeMage> You can just not use it...I'm not sure how deeply into Ubuntu's configs you would have to dig to disable it.  I use other distros primarily, just have ubuntu on one of my work machines.
[20:13] <crzdcarney> i am actually on linux mint right now not ubuntu
[20:13] <Borealix> ./clear
[20:13] <Borealix> opps
[20:14] <bekks> crzdcarney: So refer to the mint support community please.
[20:15] <HedgeMage> telmac: btw, I'm back now if you need i3 help
[20:15] <crzdcarney> i tried, not super helpful, figured i would check here since mint and ubuntu are similar
[20:16] <crzdcarney> but thank you for pointing me in the right direction

[20:24] <metallic> A swift question, what is the difference between "umount /something" and "umount -l /something"? I am not sure if I understand the description of the -l flag on the man page
[20:24] <EriC^^> metallic: umount -l will lazy unmount it
[20:24] <EriC^^> meaning it will tell the system it is unmounted, but it actually won't get unmounted until all the files aren't in use yet
[20:25] <EriC^^> which is dangerous, in case you unplug the usb after a umount -l, cause some files will still be open
[20:25] <metallic> mmmm... interesting, thanks EriC^^ :)

[20:44] <pantato> the guides i am seeing for AMD proprietary driver installation say there should be a sh file downloaded from the ati site. I'm only seeing deb files on the site

[20:45] <daftykins> ubuntu i should think
[20:45] <daftykins> perhaps they've finally changed how they provide things

[20:46] <pantato> yeah. I had a little trouble last time i tried it with the deb package. This is a clean install now though. I'll report back how it goes
[20:46] <HedgeMage> telmac: You can, from the login screen, select an i3 session...but IIRC (haven't done it in a while) there was a need to disable a bunch of stuff Ubuntu starts by default for all X sessions.
[20:46] <OerHeks> if you run ubuntu, why not choose ubuntu 64 ..
[20:46] <HedgeMage> telmac: That said, I'd prefer the minimal install...less cruft to contend with.

[21:00] <HedgeMage> telmac: And now you know why gentoo is my primary distro. :)

[21:01] <teward> dubhdara: if it's not you have zero network connectivity.
[21:01] <teward> dubhdara: did you verify the IP address you assigned is in the acceptable IP range, and that the IP address isn't already in use on the network?
[21:01] <dubhdara> no

[21:37] <Guest97876> I did.
[21:37] <telmac> you did, since you plugged it back in?
[21:37] <Guest97876> Yeah, I manually typed in the path and everything.
[21:38] <EriC^^> Guest97876: that sounds like ubuntu is installed already and is failing to boot
[21:38] <Guest97876> Yeah, let me tell you what happened
[21:38] <Guest97876> I had a Windows 8 laptop. A long time ago. I got fed up, installed 14.04. It was super buggy.
[21:39] <Guest97876> A few days ago, I decided I wanted to wipe it and start fresh. I deleted one of my partitions (probably why it cant boot, i know i really messed up here), and turned it off. I've been stuck with the initramfs error ever since.
[21:39] <Guest97876> I have no idea what to do.
[21:39] <telmac> my guess would be that you deleted grub
[21:39] <telmac> so, you should just reinstall
[21:39] <Guest97876> no, i'm able to go to this grub screen
[21:39] <Guest97876> i'm TRYING to reinstall
[21:39] <EriC^^> Guest97876: do you have data on it that you need?
[21:39] <Guest97876> no, nothing on it that i need
[21:39] <telmac> yeah no I'm getting to that
[21:40] <Guest97876> i would LOVE to wipe the thing from scratch
[21:40] <telmac> idk why you needed to type in the path for your flash drive
[21:40] <EriC^^> Guest97876: ok, how did you make the live usb?
[21:40] <telmac> like uh, shouldn't your bios just give you a list of bootable devices?
[21:40] <telmac> and btw have you tried booting the live usb on anything else?
[21:40] <Guest97876> Well, originally I just downloaded the iso and popped it on there, but then i used a program that was reccomended to me from an ubuntu website, i cant remember what it is exactly but i believe it works
[21:40] <Guest97876> as i WAS able to get to the ubuntu splash screen earlier
[21:41] <Guest97876> but when i tried installing, i got an error
[21:41] <Guest97876> the error was kernel panic-not syncing: VFS: unable to mount root fs on unknown block(0,2)
[21:42] <EriC^^> Guest97876: ok, are you using uefi?
[21:42] <Guest97876> Uefi?
[21:43] <Guest97876> I'm not quite sure.
[21:43] <EriC^^> Guest97876: ok, enter the bios, and check is uefi is enabled or not, and the boot order
[21:43] <Guest97876> got it, will do that now.
[21:44] <Guest97876> arghh, every time i go into the bios i have to retype in the path
[21:44] <EriC^^> Guest97876: what do you mean?
[21:45] <Guest97876> Well, it's not a boot option when I start BIOS back up. I had previously entered it in and saved my changes, so I have to Add New Boot Option again
[21:45] <Guest97876> also I'm not seeing anything about UEFI, where would that be at
[21:46] <Guest97876> J:\EFI\BOOT\grubx64.efi is my path, im just posing it so i dont forget it later
[21:47] <Guest97876> anyways, i've now added the usb as a boot option, and set it as Boot Option #1. What else do I need to do
[21:47] <EriC^^> Guest97876: ok, so that means you're using uefi, as grubx64.efi is the efi file
[21:47] <EriC^^> Guest97876: set the usb as the first option, and then reboot so it loads
[21:48] <Guest97876> Ok, that didn't do anything.
[21:48] <Guest97876> It still takes me to the purple ubuntu screen that says GNU GRUB version 2.02 on the top
[21:49] <Guest97876> not the splash screen that i was able to get to earlier, which i did i think by randomly hitting enter on some things in the Boot Override section
[21:49] <EriC^^> Guest97876: ok, try to press esc when the pc boots, you might get a boot options menu, select it and then choose usb uefi
[21:49] <owen1> closing the lid doesn't hibernate (15.05). any tips?
[21:50] <Guest97876> ok i did get that screen BUT for some reason, the usb isnt an option!!
[21:50] <Guest97876> i dont get why it wont save, i AM hitting save changes
[21:51] <EriC^^> Guest97876: try a different usb port
[21:51] <Guest97876> Oh my god.
[21:51] <Guest97876> I think that might be it.

[21:53] <Guest97876> ok, its STILL not showing up on that boot device screen, but it does show a USB device that hasnt been plugged into my laptop for DAYS? im going to try selecting that, maybe it is reading my usb as the old one or something
[21:53] <daftykins> no reason to use it anymore
[21:53] <Guest97876> YES
[21:53] <Guest97876> THERE WE GO
[21:53] <schindler> ooo, let me go look that up
[21:53] <Guest97876> ok im at the ubuntu splash screen and now back to that error
[21:53] <Guest97876> kernel panic-not syncing: VFS: unable to mount root fs on unknown block(0,2)
[21:53] <Guest97876> which i have no idea how to fix
[21:54] <EriC^^> Guest97876: ok, boot the grubx64.efi file you booted earlier
[21:54] <Guest97876> how do i do that?
[21:55] <Guest97876> isnt booting the grubx64.efi file what got me to the ubuntu install splash screen?
[21:55] <schindler> does anyone know what the wildcard is for the nvida settings string matching? is it *?
[21:55] <EriC^^> Guest97876: when you got the boot options menu earlier was there a boot from file?
[21:55] <daftykins> schindler: just purge all nvidia* all bumblebee* then install nvidia-### and nvidia-prime from default repos
[21:55] <schindler> yea I already did that
[21:56] <daftykins> schindler: including nvidia-prime?
[21:56] <daftykins> despite not knowing what it is 0o
[21:56] <EriC^^> Guest97876: booting that file should try to boot your old ubuntu installation, we need grub
[21:56] <schindler> yes
[21:56] <EriC^^> Guest97876: so boot it, and when grub appears press c
[21:56] <Guest97876> ahhhh
[21:57] <Guest97876> ok, im at the grub command line, what now?
[21:57] <schindler> What I ment if for the application profile rules
[21:57] <daftykins> schindler: huh?
[21:57] <schindler> is*
[21:57] <EriC^^> Guest97876: type ls
[21:57] <daftykins> schindler: did you not get the package nvidia-settings too?
[21:58] <schindler> in nvidia-settings, you can set rules
[21:58] <schindler> I just wanna know for the "string matching" part, do I need to add a wildcard
[21:58] <Guest97876> ok, it returned
[21:58] <EriC^^> Guest97876: do you still have the iso you downloaded for the live usb?
[21:58] <schindler> like *java*
[21:58] <Guest97876> (hd0) (hd0,msdos1) (hd1) (hd1, msdos1)
[21:59] <daftykins> eh never dealt with that directly, might be best to look it up
[21:59] <schindler> k thx
[21:59] <Guest97876> the iso is on the usb
[21:59] <EriC^^> Guest97876: yeah, but do you have the original file somewhere else?
[22:00] <Guest97876> i don't think so. i mean, i could download it again right now

[22:02] <stacks88> i just ran adduser bob.. then after i ran the command 'groups', and it only says root. but when i do cat /etc/groups|grep bob , i see bob there. Is it normal that when i type groups, i DONT see bob as a listed group?
[22:03] <daftykins> ubuntuislove: nah i'd have answered both in one go if so \o/
[22:03] <enigma_> so any uk user in here
[22:03] <enigma_> users*
[22:03] <EriC^^> stacks88: yes, you need to logout and back in
[22:03] <ubuntuislove> @daftykins :) wish you to have nice day
[22:04] <cromagi> anyone on kubuntu 15.04?
[22:04] <EriC^^> Guest97876: ok, type ls (hd0,msdos1)/
=== shadok_ is now known as shadok
[22:04] <cromagi> ?
[22:04] <stacks88> i logged out nad back in, still see root as the only group, but im guessing this is normal since theres tons of groups in /etc/group and i dont se any of those listed either when typing groups
[22:04] <daftykins> cromagi: all the folks in #kubuntu are - but if you ask your next question, it might be easier to help
[22:05] <EriC^^> Guest97876: are you sure that legacy mode is not enabled in the bios?
[22:05] <Guest97876> ooh lord, thats a lot to type in
[22:05] <cromagi> It still feels super unstable. Spotify doesnt work, windows have "seizures" so to speak when i minimize maximize open or close them.
[22:05] <LeEarl> hi
[22:05] <Guest97876> im not sure, do you want me to go check right now?
