[00:07] <penguin42> are you saying that advertising something as a reluctance motor might not sound that good?
[00:13] <daftykins> XD makes it sound like it doesn't want to be cleaning for you
[00:13] <daftykins> instead it wants to be free, where all the motors spin for nobody but themselves

[08:24] <brobostigon> morning boys and girls.
[08:29] <dutchie> morning
[08:32] <brobostigon> mornind dutchie
[14:34] <diddledan> howdo
[14:35] <diddledan> sorry, daftykins, I went to bed just after my comment last night so you may have felt ignored :-/
[14:36] <diddledan> so a digital motor is actually a reluctance motor, but what's the v6 all about?
[14:36] <diddledan> it's got 6 cylindars in a V formation?
[14:37] <diddledan> like my ca?
[14:37] <diddledan> car*
[14:37] <diddledan> do I need to feed it petroleum?
[14:42]  * penguin42 assumes it's the one after v5
[14:42] <Azelphur> https://twitter.com/ownClouders/status/598741430333480960 look ma I'm famous
[14:44] <diddledan> \o/
[14:44]  * diddledan will watch that in a bit
[14:44] <penguin42> Azelphur: Excellent
[14:45] <Azelphur> :)
[14:45] <popey> yay
[14:45] <diddledan> currently watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B392kwHg_Rs a discussion starter presentation about drupal.org's workflow for contributions
[15:00]  * penguin42 wishes he understood why it cost ~£7M to build a 400m chunk of train track
[15:04] <diddledan> 400metres, for 7M? that's an impressive overspend
[15:06] <penguin42> diddledan: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-15519605
[15:07] <penguin42> (It just opened)
[15:09] <penguin42> looking at the pictures it looks single track at that
[15:32] <daftykins> diddledan: hehe np, yeah i just assumed the 6th version - though surely you'd not want that in marketing 'cause it sounds like it took that many tries to get it right
[15:33] <diddledan> lol
[15:33] <diddledan> their advert says "only the handheld dyson uses a vee six digital motor"
[15:34] <diddledan> it's like women's beauty products containing random marketing invented names
[15:35] <diddledan> it's probably exactly the same as competitor-x just named differently with a trademark so only this company can include it because it's a trademark
[15:36] <penguin42> diddledan: You mean things with enhanced serum of youngify and anti-wrinkelate?
[15:36] <diddledan> yup
[15:36] <daftykins> XD
[15:37] <diddledan> includes elastane etc
[15:37] <daftykins> and for some reason possesses the ability to say hello to Vera all the time, too
[15:37] <diddledan> for elastic skin
[15:37] <diddledan> vera's popular
[15:37] <daftykins> that she is

[15:40] <moreati> sorry, I was using the text box to try something, didn't mean to press return
[15:41] <shauno> that's kinda funkylookin
[15:42] <moreati> playing with http://adamvarga.com/strike/
[15:43] <daftykins> o0
[15:46] <diddledan> I'm guessing my client isn't displaying it right
[15:46] <diddledan> I see: a_b_c.....
[15:47] <daftykins> ok here in irssi
[15:47] <shauno> it looks like strikethru on mine, but odd-looking because the strike is at a different height in each character
[15:47]  * penguin42 sees it as a cross-throughed text
[15:48] <moreati> The underline equivalent doesn't render very well for me, on 15.04/Unity https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underline#Unicode There are gaps, and additionally differing height in Firefox a̲b̲c̲d̲e̲f̲g̲h̲i̲j̲k̲l̲m̲n̲o̲p̲q̲r̲s̲t̲u̲v̲w̲x̲y̲z̲0̲1̲2̲3̲4̲5̲6̲7̲8̲9̲
[15:48] <diddledan> I see that as underscored but only on the second letter through to a space at the end
[15:48] <diddledan> i.e. the first a isn't underscored but the rest is along with a trailing underscore
[15:48] <shauno> oh that's odd.  I get gaps, and most where they should be, but the gap between p & q isn't lined
[15:49] <penguin42> moreati: It's nutty what you can do with unicode ɥ̶b̶n̶o̶ɹ̶ɥ̶ʇ̶ ̶ʞ̶ɔ̶n̶ɹ̶ʇ̶s̶ ̶u̶ʍ̶o̶p̶ ̶ǝ̶p̶ı̶s̶d̶n̶
[15:49] <moreati> In Pidgin on 15.04 the strikethrough is correct, in Chrome and Firefox the strikethrough starts at the second character
[15:49] <penguin42> moreati: Yeh, I see the same
[15:49] <penguin42> moreati: And it's right in konsole but not terminator
[15:49] <diddledan> again the strikethrough isn't shown on mine in favour of an _ between each character
[15:50] <diddledan> the letters themselves are correctly upside-down and back-to-front
[15:50] <moreati> correction: Pidgin has a gap in the strikethrough on wide characters e.g. w, M
[15:50] <daftykins> i like letters
[15:50] <daftykins> ^_^
[15:50] <daftykins> right, what to do today
[15:50] <moreati> those upside down characters are actually glyphs from other alphabets/writing systems
[15:51]  * diddledan gets an envelope and stuffs a piece of paper into it to send to daftykins 
[15:51] <daftykins> diddledan: lets have a postal chess game!
[15:51] <diddledan> eep
[15:51]  * popey puts his chess pieces in an envelope
[15:51] <daftykins> it's ok i haven't played in years so i'm gonna be rubbish
[15:52] <daftykins> and even then you can probably count on one hand how many games i've played in my life :>
[15:52]  * diddledan fires-up a computer player to play on his behalf
[15:52] <shauno> I get http://i.imgur.com/Ke2bRuI.png  and http://i.imgur.com/JNJcHvB.png
[15:52] <daftykins> hrmm that's a nice readable font
[15:52] <shauno> the varying height of the strikethrough is a very strange effect
[15:53] <diddledan> shauno: you're just wonky
[15:53] <daftykins> popey: have you been enjoying GTA V on a new card, then?
[15:54] <popey> no, i have been enjoying it on my existing card
[15:54] <popey> after I asked about new cards here, nvidia gave me a driver update which included the automagic thing that sets the game up correctly
[15:54] <diddledan> put a new card on the card :-p
[15:54] <popey> it's now running flawlessly
[15:55] <diddledan> just make sure you're ready to be carded
[15:55] <daftykins> hrmm, my old Q6600 runs with it pretty poorly with my GTX 560 Ti so it can't look all that great?
[15:55] <daftykins> -with
[15:55] <popey> looks great to me
[15:56] <daftykins> that's the odd thing about graphical and audio quality though
[17:00] <diddledan> paraphrase: A paradigm shift is indistuingishable from a bad idea
[17:41] <penguin42> what about a paradigm shift in bad ideas?
[17:41] <penguin42> like the Orion space craft
[17:42] <zmoylan-pi> a paradigm shift in bad ideas...  microsoft changing the ui to touch silliness version? :-)
[17:45] <diddledan> onions in space is always a bad idea
[17:46] <penguin42> yes, it would be cruel to put one in someones helmet
[17:47] <zmoylan-pi> whereas in ants in their space suit is hilarious... :-)
[18:09] <ali1234> moreati: firefox has terrible font rendering
[18:10] <moreati> ali1234: I saw similar rendering errors in Chrome and Firefox
[18:10] <moreati> *Chromium
[18:11] <ali1234> https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-45SP60v6kms/Uy7Cn_UeKAI/AAAAAAAACcw/DzaItkLgRSE/w426-h237/Screenshot%2B-%2B230314%2B-%2B11%253A16%253A35.png
[18:11] <ali1234> dat h
[18:11] <ali1234> h for high
[18:12] <ali1234> i don't know what it is about text that is so hard
[18:12] <ali1234> but it seems like nobody can do it right except apple and microsoft
[18:13] <ali1234> and maybe gtk if you are lucky
[18:19] <zmoylan-pi> adobe? :-D
[18:20] <ali1234> never had to deal with pdf i take it...
[18:21] <zmoylan-pi> i have... lots... never had much trouble once you've beaten them with a stick
[18:21] <ali1234> challenge for you then. extract the text from this pdf and run it through google translate: http://scharmn.narod.ru/AVD/Gauss_15_2.pdf
[18:22] <zmoylan-pi> been a while... ::ponders::
[18:23] <diddledan> I've heard pdf is a frankenstein format with bits from here and bits from there and barely hodgepodged together
[18:24] <zmoylan-pi> a lot of it's wackiness seems deliberate to prevent ebooks from been ripped to text
[18:24] <zmoylan-pi> i've used various wackiness to break them open.  ghost script, text printer drivers, calibre
[18:25] <ali1234> there is no drm here and the text is stored in the pdf as a series of codepoints
[18:25] <ali1234> try "pdf2txt" for a start
[18:25] <zmoylan-pi> yeah, it means you can get tiny random chunks out of the pdf.  i've seen that before too
[18:26] <shauno> hm, fun.  osx falls apart on that one too
[18:27] <zmoylan-pi> calibre is random text...
[18:29] <shauno> mine doesn't look random.  it looks like it's just missing all the cyrilic characters
[18:30] <ali1234> there's some english on the last page, can't even copy that
[18:31] <shauno> oh, you're right.  I'm just getting tables, figures and equations, not body text at all
[18:32] <ali1234> pdf2txt outputs a lot of "(cid:27)(cid:25)(cid:17)(cid:26)"
[18:32] <shauno> and it's a complete dog to scroll, which is unusual on osx
[18:34] <shauno> (the display engine is pdf-based like MacOS was postscript-based, which is really weird to explain, but ends up with above-average pdf support for free)
[18:34] <ali1234> presumably you can print super high res screenshots as well :)
[18:35] <shauno> heh, it seems not, they're just kicked out as png
[18:36] <shauno> I have no idea to what extent it's still true either, but originally quartz was described as a pdf version of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_PostScript
[18:37] <penguin42> oh heck, not used that for a LONG time
[18:37] <shauno> both of which strike me as an interesting mix of voodoo, witchcraft and lies
[18:38]  * penguin42 remembers using Sun's NeWS X based display-postscript stuff
[18:39]  * zmoylan-pi wonders if it's the mixed character sets that's making the normal tools misbehave
[18:42] <shauno> I'm not sure they're stored as characters at all
[18:42] <zmoylan-pi> i do have a few d&d pdfs that store everything as images.  they're... fun... :-)
[18:44] <shauno> the characters don't hint properly if I scale off 100%
[18:45] <shauno> like http://i.imgur.com/FXd2DMh.png
[18:46] <shauno> α1 etc I can copy fine, and they render properly.  the body text blurs, and shouldn't
[18:47] <ali1234> looks like each glyph is stored as one bitmap and then indexed
[18:48] <shauno> hm.  so if you really wanted to, you could probably rip it out with a lookup table
[18:48] <shauno> but if you're just trying to prove that pdf are perfectly capable of being a royal pain in the familyfriendly, it's surplus to requirement
[18:50] <zmoylan-pi> bizarre, i got caibre to convert to epub instead of text and while first page looks good it goes rapidly downhill
[18:54] <zmoylan-pi> if i had to get them as useable text with a 14page document it might be faster/less effort just to retype them.  not easy if you don't speak the language but not impossible.  if they're needed by a group you can split the work in such a way there's overlap to ensure accuracy
[18:54] <ali1234> could just OCR it
[18:54] <zmoylan-pi> that too
[18:55] <zmoylan-pi> but i've used ocr and prefer a human making mistakes over ocr making mistakes.
[19:00] <penguin42> very different type of mistakes
[19:01] <zmoylan-pi> and i found it easier to spot the human mistakes as i made the same ones myself..
[19:06] <shauno> I dunno.  in cyrillic, "the same ones myself" would be everything
[19:10] <daftykins> hrmm debating something like this for my friends art gallery
[19:10] <daftykins> http://www.amazon.co.uk/ANNKE-Weatherproof-Megapixels-Hi-Resolution-Vandalproof/dp/B00NZWIZYS/
[19:10] <daftykins> maplins selection seem to be a lot more expensive :D
[19:10] <daftykins> and it looks like if they even ship here, they won't remove VAT :P
[19:11] <penguin42> maplins more expensive? <shock>
[19:13] <daftykins> :D
[19:14] <daftykins> you have to give me some lee-way there, we don't have them locally and i've only used them once to buy some fuses during Uni :P
[19:29] <diddledan> OCR leads to weirdness
[19:29] <diddledan> e.g an i transferred as an l
[19:29] <diddledan> which makes it particularly difficult to work out swedish place names when they're transcribed via OCR
[19:30] <diddledan> (I'm referring to the amazon kindle version of the girl with the dragon tats)
[19:30] <diddledan> that's an A not an I
[19:30] <diddledan> although dragon tats with an I would be interesting
[19:34] <zmoylan-pi> spotting numbers amongst the text was always my favourite way to spot ocred text :-)
[19:35] <daftykins> tsk tsk naughty diddledan
[19:35] <daftykins> brings a whole new meaning to "Here be Dragons"
[19:36] <diddledan> lol
[19:36] <diddledan> don't look them in the eye
[19:36] <zmoylan-pi> it's the way it follows you around the room... :-P
[19:44] <diddledan> don't you love how folk from around the indian region refer to GB as Gee-Bees rather than Gig or Gigs or Gigabytes
[19:44] <diddledan> "I've got 500 Gee-Bees"
[19:44] <diddledan> oh gee, bees!
[19:44] <diddledan> don't you hate bees
[19:45] <diddledan> they're fine when they're pollinating elsewhere but come near me and I run a mile
[19:45] <diddledan> they shouldn't pollinate in public anyway
[19:46] <diddledan> now, see, you all bring my randomness out if you stop talking because I just natter away
[19:47] <diddledan> if you don't want me to be crazy, don't stop talking!
[19:47] <daftykins> so rare anyone gets any notation correct :(
[19:48] <diddledan> now as we refer to GB as "Gigs" does that mean TB is Tigs?
[19:48] <zmoylan-pi> nah, in honour of the times we live in they are now terror bites
[19:48] <diddledan> or Ters?
[19:49] <diddledan> not to be confused with T'sers as in "It's Hers"
[20:30] <foobarry> any russian speakers in here tonight?
[20:30] <diddledan> niet
[20:31] <foobarry> trying to deipher a label
[20:31] <diddledan> does it have fake letters on it?
[20:31] <daftykins> #ubuntu-ru ? :)
[20:32] <foobarry> but does ubuntu-ru speak english?
[20:32] <diddledan> the russians pretend to have a written language but I think they just make stuff up as they go along
[20:32] <foobarry> http://i.imgur.com/6Btt40O.jpg
[20:33] <diddledan> aah that's easy. 56 in russian is 56 in english too
[20:33] <daftykins> =]
[20:33] <foobarry> mapps seems to be in there
[20:34] <daftykins> o0
[20:34] <diddledan> mapps is a weird one - he gallivants all over the place :-p
[20:34] <foobarry> must be vodka related
[20:34] <diddledan> I recall he disappeared to russia a few months ago
[20:34] <diddledan> can't remember whether that was before or after he moved to the rock
[20:35] <diddledan> (alcatraz? :-p)
[20:35] <foobarry> gib
[20:36] <daftykins> he went to the Ukraine i thought
[20:36] <diddledan> oh, close
[20:37] <diddledan> former USSR at least
[20:37] <foobarry> i got this hat in 1990 in gum dept store
[20:38] <daftykins> they had hats back then?
[20:40] <diddledan> when were hats invented anywho?
[20:41] <diddledan> new-fangled things for foobarry ?
[20:41] <diddledan> :-p
[20:42] <foobarry> a russian style hat
