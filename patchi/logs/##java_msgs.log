<darkelement>	 guys how can my java function accept any value as a parameter?
<mebigfatguy>	ddefine the parm as object
<darkelement>	ahh,thnaks
<darkelement>	it does not work with double, however.
<mebigfatguy>	it would work for double
<darkelement>		public static void print(object var){
<darkelement>			system.out.println(var);
<darkelement>		}
<darkelement>	trying to do this, "not applicable"
<mebigfatguy>	print(double.valueof(1.1))
<ojacobson>	darkelement: javac -version?
<mebigfatguy>	you can't specify a parmaeter type that handles both primitive values and objects
<darkelement>	alright
<i-make-robots>	mebigfatguy - thanks for trying to help.  i'll probably just use export for now and fix maven in the next edition.
