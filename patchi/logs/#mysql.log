<DarkElement>	Hey guys how can I view and make databases, tables, etc. With a program, rather than just the command prompt?
<aradapilot>	!t DarkElement client
<aradapilot>	hm
<DarkElement>	I can use ubuntu or windows, just kinda new to this and hoping to use what I saw a friend use
<aradapilot>	there's no client one?
<aradapilot>	DarkElement: navicat, sequelpro, workbench, some others
<aradapilot>	there are quite a few options
<DarkElement>	Alrighty
<DarkElement>	Easier on linux right
<aradapilot>	try a couple and pick whichever you like best
<aradapilot>	most are cross-platform
<DarkElement>	aradapilot, I will do just this, thank you
<DarkElement>	I think I'll use Ubuntu anyway
<DarkElement>	XD
<aradapilot>	cool, start with those.  i think sequelpro might be mac only, the other two are all platforms
<nesoi>	oops, hardware problem
<nesoi>	so what was the obvious solution to my mysql CLI login issue? :)
<aradapilot>	mysql -h hostname/ip
*	aradapilot steals mgriffin's thunder
<nesoi>	-h and then -u then -p?
<DarkElement>	aradapilot, is navicat lite alright?
<DarkElement>	aradapilot, also, how will we know there was lightning now?
<nesoi>	worked!
<nesoi>	thanks!
<DarkElement>	*lite -> free trial
<DarkElement>	Also unsure which is better for all of this, Ubuntu or windows 7. Opinions?
<mgriffin>	aradapilot++
<aradapilot>	DarkElement: yeah go for the free trial.  if you like it, they have a $15 version that has the most useful stuff.
<aradapilot>	I use ubuntu on my desktop and have a mac laptop
<DarkElement>	aradapilot, alright, but which OS woudl you recommend for it
<DarkElement>	Oh.
<DarkElement>	So you haven't tried it in windows? how is it on ubuntu?
<aradapilot>	works fine
<aradapilot>	yeah, i don't have a windows machine
<DarkElement>	Alright
<DarkElement>	I've been liking linux more and more anyways
<DarkElement>	XD
<aradapilot>	welcome to the club!
<DarkElement>	Coming closer and closer to fully booting into and installing Ubuntu on my currently Windows 7 laptop. Just VMWare for now, howver.
<DarkElement>	*installing Ubuntu and never going back*

<nesoi>	does anyone here know if snapshots are guaranteed to be transaction-consistent?
<nesoi>	and have a reference? :)
<ss23>	What kind of snapshots?
<nesoi>	AWS RDS MySQL snapshots actually ss23
<nesoi>	but snapshots in general
<nesoi>	I haven't found any reference to how transaction safe snapshots are so far
<mgriffin>	anything that isnt commited will be rolled back on startup
<nesoi>	mgriffin:  so you're saying that they do end up consistent?
<mgriffin>	nesoi: i would check with your provider but they would be pretty worthless otherwise
<nesoi>	heh. True, but I never assume anything will work as expected unless someone says it really does. And even then I'm not 100% certain.
<mgriffin>	well ask your provider and get it in writing (or read the docs they have written and have a lawyer double check everything)
<nesoi>	mgriffin:  :)
<mgriffin>	"snapshots" in general can be either consistent or inconsistent, depending on your data and your method
<mgriffin>	blindly creating an lvm/xfs snapshot should be safe if you don't care about non-transactional tables
<nesoi>	interesting. what do you mean about "non-transactional tables'?
<nesoi>	mean by
<mgriffin>	!t nesoi myisam
<ubiquity_bot>	nesoi: a malfunctioning form of blackhole engine that sometimes accidentally stores data.
<nesoi>	oh I see
<nesoi>	but if we're using InnoDB that's not an issue, you're saying.
<mgriffin>	maybe. do you care about binary log position?
<mgriffin>	also, if you are using innodb, maybe you want xtrabackup not "snapshots" if snapshots are really expensive in your case
<mgriffin>	https://www.percona.com/blog/2013/07/09/lvm-read-performance-during-snapshots/
<mgriffin>	(does not apply to thin provisioning)
<nesoi>	I'm not sure if I do or not in this case. If we restore from a snapshot and set up replication subsequently it probably doesn't matter?
<mgriffin>	not sure what you are asking.
<nesoi>	maybe I'm not either! How about: when would one care about binary log position with regard to snapshots?
<mgriffin>	pitr or new slaves of this server
<mgriffin>	(using existing backups)
<nesoi>	so let's say we have a replicated server
<nesoi>	and everything fails totally
<nesoi>	and we're left with a snapshot
<nesoi>	and have to bring it all back from that
<nesoi>	are there any issues there that I should think about?
<mgriffin>	pitr
<nesoi>	other than that I'm not seeing a case
<nesoi>	pitr?
<mgriffin>	yes, the thing i keep talking about
<nesoi>	:)
<nesoi>	I see
<nesoi>	so what do you do if you care about that?
<mgriffin>	usually you hold FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK, acquire the binary log position, create the snapshot, and finally release the lock
<mgriffin>	rds might be something different'
<nesoi>	ah
<nesoi>	I think this is dong what your'e suggesting https://github.com/alestic/ec2-consistent-snapshot
<nesoi>	hm. or maybe not
<mgriffin>	that is not rds.
<nesoi>	oops, right. Maybe worth asking AWS support about.
<mgriffin>	nesoi: start with docs http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIT.html
<nesoi>	good idea
<nesoi>	right, that's with backups
<nesoi>	but this is a different use case
<mgriffin>	i have no idea sorry.
<nesoi>	thanks though!
<JJjack>	what's the best approach to creating a report from multple table count and date range?
<aradapilot>	JJjack: a query!
<aradapilot>	we're going to need a bit more info than that
