<darkelement>	hey guys why was ihatehex banned?
<_w_>	because he cannot control himself when he feels he is being insulted
<darkelement>	ok, like what happened
<darkelement>	that caused him to be banned
<_w_>	<ihatehex> i didn't just hit her and quit it, ^python111_, i called her, i asked her out for another date, so don't worry about me 'using' your mom for sex
<_w_>	was the last one
<_w_>	but repeated outbursts and no effect from prolonged quiets, as well as an attitude that shows it will just continue, was what got him banned
<darkelement>	that message doesnt seem to bad, since it was obviously a joke, but i understand
<darkelement>	too*
<_w_>	i think it was neither an obvious joke, nor made without malice
<_w_>	and even if it somehow was, still entirely inappropriate
<_w_>	<ihatehex> oh come on, he was flaming me multiple times and i responded once
<darkelement>	hmm
<_w_>	this after the one and only negative comment was <^python111_> ihatehex, fkin pleb
<darkelement>	sounds like he tried to fight fire with fire
<_w_>	sounds like that would continue
<darkelement>	yea, maybe
<darkelement>	well, thanks
<darkelement>	see ya
