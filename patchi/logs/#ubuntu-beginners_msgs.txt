<pedro3005> jdeloach, nvidia plays nicer with linux
<phrea> hmm, my gf has a pc that uses karmic, it used to be able to go online via the onboard nic, but all the sudden it doesnt anymore...
<pedro3005> phrea, oh noes!
<phrea> i told her to reboot the system while the utp is connected
<jdeloach> yeah. too bad i didn't know that two years ago when i bought my computer :( would have gotten nvidia
<phrea> both nic and utp cable are fully working
<pedro3005> phrea, the card is detected?
<phrea> yes
<phrea> more news later ;)
<nhandler> as a heads up, ubuntulog is now in this channel. public logs will be available on irclogs.ubuntu.com now
<phrea> oh no..
<pedro3005> i guess i can't plot my murders here now
<phrea> i hate irc logs...
<phrea> pedro3005: we now have to be careful indeed
<phrea> ;)
<pedro3005> lukjad86, i'm still out to get you, know that
<phrea> dude, shhht, that just got posted on the irclogs man !
<phrea> oh, i just clicked, and it seems that everything ever posted here has already been logged...
<phrea> excuse me if i sign off.
<pedro3005> oh cool
<pedro3005> i can track myself down
<pedro3005> let's see, 2008
<pedro3005> wait, no
<pedro3005> phrea, it's general ubuntu logs, not this channel
<phrea> i noticed :)
<phrea> that's why i stfu'ed
<pedro3005> you made me believe for a second i could re-live a part of my life!
<pedro3005> :p
<phrea> well, you can
<pedro3005> phrea, shit, http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2010/03/04/%23ubuntu-beginners.txt
<phrea> indeed, sir
<phrea> it seems a bit chaotic
<phrea> i'd devise them in channels, rather than year/month/date
<phrea> but that's just me
<pedro3005> yeah
<pedro3005> truth is
<pedro3005> you gotta reach a whole new level of boredom to go through that stuff
<pedro3005> so probably it'll go unread
<phrea> indeed
<phrea> that's why i would devise them via channels
<phrea> to save some boredom time

<quickard> i can not log in to ubuntu because i can not see nor enter anything into the user accounts window
<mathay> quickard: kind of that your keyboard isn't responding?
<mathay> *kind of like
<mathay> ie, you can still move your mouse around and what not, right?
<quickard> yes
<quickard> i can move the mouse, i can see the accessability window
<quickard> and when i hit the power button the shutdown window pops up, then it tells me that the desktop is not responding
<quickard> when i go to shutdown it says that the gnome desktop is not responding
<wojox> do i just register my nickname here with: /msg nickserv register
<elfy> and a e-mail address
<elfy> eg /msg nickserv register bar foo@bar.com
<wojox> what about the password?
<elfy> syntax: register <password> <email-address>
<wojox> will it be seen or is it not ipportant
<elfy> it would be seen if you made a mistake and it was read as text - i usually do stuff like that in the server window xchat gives me
<wojox> thanks elfy
<elfy> welcome :)

<tdn> i have a machine with two network adapters: an ethernet adapter and a wireless adapter. how can i turn the wireless adapter into an access point?
<nigelb> tdn: you're looking for internet connection sharing?
<tdn> nigelb, i want to use this machine as access point to set up wireless connection.
<nigelb> tdn: does this help you? http://doctormo.ubuntu-ma.us/2009/12/06/ubuntus-internet-connection-sharing/
<tdn> nigelb, rt73usb/qcom <- this is my wlan card.
<tdn> nigelb, no. i only have ssh access to the box.
<tdn> at the moment.
<nigelb> oh
<tdn> if i write iwconfig wlan0 mode master, i get an error: error for wireless request "set mode" (8b06) :     set failed on device wlan0 ; invalid argument.
<nigelb> tdn: try this forum post then http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=91370
<nigelb> my knowledge of networking is kind of minimal, so i'm not sure how much debugging i can do
<catchitbaby1> hi
