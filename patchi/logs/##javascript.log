Apr 28 23:00:12 <deltab>	raw tcp/ip would likely only be available to browser extensions or packaged web apps
Apr 28 23:00:13 <localred>	is that something that the websockets works around, or does it suffer from the same limitations? and would most (or any) major browsers allow such a tcpip connection?
Apr 28 23:00:37 <hello_kitty>	websockets work around it.. they're basically a flavor of tcp/ip made for browsers
Apr 28 23:01:05 <deltab>	ws is a protocol that runs over tcp/ip
Apr 28 23:01:14 <hello_kitty>	as opposed to like.. browser-specific udp magicks, which i assume exist but havent touched
Apr 28 23:01:41 <deltab>	browsers don't allow web pages to access tcp because of the likelihood of abuse

Apr 28 23:04:33 <localred>	to what degree is websockets sandboxed on the local machines then?
Apr 28 23:05:00 <localred>	is it completely possible to interact with both the server back on the web and the local program on the client (all through the javascript intermediary)?
Apr 28 23:05:44 <hello_kitty>	i don't know anything about sandboxing, but i can connect to a variety of ws servers locally and on the internet at the same time
Apr 28 23:06:03 <hello_kitty>	i'm not sure if i've set some sort of developer flag, I can't remember... i think it just works
Apr 28 23:06:51 <hello_kitty>	i'm pretty sure multiple connections can even be opened from one conventional webpage
Apr 28 23:08:19 <localred>	because i was reading that websockets begins from an upgrade of an http protocol connection, but i think you are right and i think this is all possible. on to an attempt at an implementation
Apr 28 23:15:59 <aucklab>	Having an issue with $.each() -- I'm sure it's probably a variable scope problem. Essentially, I am doing an $.each() on a JSON element array, and then I am trying to store the values via .push into another array.Having an issue with $.each() -- I'm sure it's probably a variable scope problem. Essentially, I am doing an $.each() on a JSON element array, and then I am trying to store the values via .push into
Apr 28 23:16:00 <aucklab>	 another array.
Apr 28 23:16:01 <aucklab>	When my $.each() loop ends, I no longer apparently have access to the variable.
Apr 28 23:16:05 <aucklab>	Here is my code: http://pastebin.com/tnxs1dDx
Apr 28 23:16:43 <ljharb>	aucklab: a) #jquery for jquery questions, b) never use $.each on arrays, use Array.prototype.forEach and friends for that.
Apr 28 23:17:00 <ljharb>	aucklab: ie, `data.businesses.forEach(function (business) { })`
Apr 28 23:17:06 <aucklab>	#jquery is dead, unfortunately.
Apr 28 23:17:11 <ljharb>	and since you're using "push", you'd want a map instead of a forEach.
Apr 28 23:17:18 <aucklab>	okay :)
Apr 28 23:17:28 <aucklab>	Is there a better way to store it? I'm a Python guy, not JS, trying to learn.
Apr 28 23:19:17 <aucklab>	I changed it to data.businesses.forEach -- working very well, thank you. My variable scope is still off.
Apr 28 23:19:27 <aucklab>	line 27 results in 0.
Apr 28 23:19:38 <ljharb>	wait
Apr 28 23:19:42 <aucklab>	(I assume because the scope is wrong) -- line 22 works, line 27 does not.
Apr 28 23:19:42 <aucklab>	Sure :)
Apr 28 23:19:44 <ljharb>	is data.businesses an array, or an object
Apr 28 23:19:51 <ljharb>	note that "associative arrays" in php are not arrays.
Apr 28 23:20:04 <aucklab>	Ah, it's an object.
Apr 28 23:20:17 <aucklab>	It comes from the JSON get,
Apr 28 23:20:50 <ljharb>	aucklab: ok then `var businesses = Object.keys(data.businesses).map(function (key) { return "key: " + key + " = val: " + data.businesses[key].name + "<br />"; });`
Apr 28 23:21:12 <aucklab>	data.businesses i an object, but businesses is an array (ideally)
Apr 28 23:21:27 <aucklab>	Instead of my forEach. Gotcha.
Apr 28 23:21:27 <ljharb>	yup ^&
Apr 28 23:22:39 <aucklab>	Here's the new code: http://pastebin.com/q9SVq4eg
Apr 28 23:23:58 <aucklab>	In this case, 20 alerts 0
Apr 28 23:24:34 <ljharb>	aucklab: ok now the problem is that you don't understand async :-)
Apr 28 23:24:42 <ljharb>	aucklab: the data is only *ever* available inside the getJSON callback.
Apr 28 23:24:46 <aucklab>	Okay, great -- we're making progress! ;)
Apr 28 23:24:51 <ljharb>	aucklab: once you go async, it's async forever, and your program continues forever inside callbacks.
Apr 28 23:25:00 <aucklab>	I can't store it outside of that scope?
Apr 28 23:25:01 <aucklab>	Interesting.
Apr 28 23:25:02 <ljharb>	no
Apr 28 23:25:12 <ljharb>	aucklab: one way to think about it is that line 17 executes many thousands of seconds after line 20 runs.
Apr 28 23:25:32 <aucklab>	That makes total sense now.
Apr 28 23:26:21 <aucklab>	So, it DOES store in businesses, it's just not there when my next line runs.
Apr 28 23:26:41 <aucklab>	So, if I had a button, and I ran that onClick(), then I referenced the businesses var .. data would exist.
Apr 28 23:26:42 <ljharb>	(also, don't use "alert", use console.log)
Apr 28 23:26:47 <aucklab>	okay :)
Apr 28 23:26:53 <ljharb>	potentially yes
Apr 28 23:26:54 <aucklab>	Thank you for all of this, as you can tell, I am brand new to JS.
Apr 28 23:27:00 <ljharb>	np, got to start somewhere
Apr 28 23:27:09 <aucklab>	Instead, I should do all of my updates inside of the async process.
Apr 28 23:27:22 <aucklab>	So, the data I am retrieving in the async, I may need later.
Apr 28 23:27:31 <aucklab>	Meaning, I will reference it based on button presses.
Apr 28 23:28:15 <aucklab>	Use case example: I want to retrieve a list of restaurants near me using the Yelp API (I am using a NodeJS middleware for this, which is returning the JSON) ... then I want to populate buttons with those Yelp results, and allow the buttons to be pressed.
Apr 28 23:28:36 <aucklab>	So, I can store the names with append() and then retrieve them with val(), as a "poor man's proof of concept" solution.
Apr 28 23:28:44 <aucklab>	Using the buttons themselves as vars, in essence .. lol.
Apr 28 23:29:12 <aucklab>	Or, alternatively, I can push the data to the MongoDB, and then read it from Mongo using a separate async call when needed.
Apr 28 23:29:17 <aucklab>	Which sounds less convoluted.
Apr 28 23:33:36 <ljharb>	less convoluted is usually better :-)
Apr 28 23:37:59 <aucklab>	hehe.
Apr 28 23:38:16 <aucklab>	Thanks so much for your help -- it's storing beautifully in the MongoDB, and this will prevent a further query to the Node middleware.
Apr 28 23:38:21 <jrich523>	anyone work with xslt and javascript?
Apr 28 23:38:24 <aucklab>	Freeing it up to do orchestration, like it should.
Apr 28 23:38:42 <jrich523>	i ask, becuase im looking to do a master/detail layout, and that doesnt seem to be supported by xslt alone
Apr 28 23:41:51 <javascript522>	Whats faster in a loop? Accessing arrays via Array[i].doSomething
Apr 28 23:42:13 <javascript522>	Or going var entry = Array[i]; entry.doSomething
Apr 28 23:42:40 <javascript522>	Assume that there's a large amount of entry or entry[i].doSoemthings
Apr 28 23:42:45 <Havvy>	javascript522:  They're equivalent.
Apr 28 23:43:13 <javascript522>	Even after large amounts of accessing?
Apr 28 23:43:19 <Havvy>	Yes.
Apr 28 23:43:27 <javascript522>	How's that work?
Apr 28 23:43:43 <falafel>	or just use `map`
Apr 28 23:43:46 <javascript522>	Wouldn't js have to look up Array[i] every time while var value = Array[i] would store that certain value?
Apr 28 23:44:25 <Havvy>	But yes, if you use .map() or .filter() or whatever is appropriate, it shouldn't matter.
Apr 28 23:44:37 <javascript522>	Talking performance wise, gotta choose the best possible
Apr 28 23:44:43 <falafel>	nah
Apr 28 23:44:49 <javascript522>	I'm fairly sure .map and .filter is slightly sloewr
Apr 28 23:45:03 <falafel>	it won't make a difference 99% of the time
Apr 28 23:45:20 <falafel>	chose what's most readable first
Apr 28 23:45:39 <javascript522>	Going through some legacy code, it isn't readable
Apr 28 23:47:13 <Havvy>	Then make the parts that you do modify readable. ;)
Apr 28 23:48:32 <ljharb>	javascript522: "faster" doesn't matter.
Apr 28 23:48:58 <ljharb>	javascript522: choose the cleanest possible. then test it and make sure it works. then profile it. and only *then* should you concern yourself with speed, and only on the slowest parts.
Apr 28 23:49:20 <ljharb>	javascript522: and loops are rarely more readable than an iteration.

<Guest99207>	dot=x=>xs=>xs[x]
<falafel>	Guest99207, a function that takes `x` and returns a function that takes `xs`, and returns `xs[x]`
<Guest99207>	that's a weird type signiture

<falafel>	x => y === function(x){return y}.bind(this)
<Agro>	oh i didnt know it binded, thats cool
<Agro>	can get rid of a lot of those
<Guest99207>	what is xs[x]
<Agro>	the xth element in the array xs
<Agro>	or maybe its map
<Agro>	a map*
<falafel>	the property `x` of the object `xs`
<falafel>	`xs` can be an object, or array, or some other object

<falafel>	when in doubt, then name it, if it is generic, then `xs` and `x` reads fine to me, or `obj` and `k`
<Havvy>	falafel:  I always use `obj/array/key/value/arg`
<ljharb>	falafel: yes but that's a weird convention that i've never seen anyone but haskellers use

<falafel>	you seem to be mixing all kinds of stuff there...
<falafel>	strings are no good for building DOM
<falafel>	at least, not like that
<falafel>	in Angular you'd use a directive
<cyberbrai>	sorry but still i am not using the directive so is there any alternative then plz it's great for me
<cyberbrai>	i think it's great to use the onclick event as a attribute for td
<cyberbrai>	falafel
<falafel>	cyberbrai, yes, ou can build that <a> with jQuery, and add an event to it, then append it to the <td>
<falafel>	$('<a>', click: reverse).appendTo(tdElement)
<falafel>	$('<a>', {click: reverse}).appendTo(tdElement)
<falafel>	something like that
<falafel>	maybe `click: reverse.bind(null, userName, Id)`
<cyberbrai>	'<td onclick=reverse()><a style="cursor:pointer" ><i class="fa fa-trash-o large"></i></a></td>' +  line where i want to append my inclick event
<falafel>	cyberbrai, using strings isn't great, it is quite error prone
<falafel>	$(

<cyberbrai>	but just tell me how can i append my `click: reverse.bind(null, userName, Id)` to td
<falafel>	$('<td>', {click: reverse.bind(null, userName, Id)})
<falafel>	that creates an element and adds an event
<falafel>	now you got JS code, instead of strings
<falafel>	then use .append, or .appendTo to build your structure
<cyberbrai>	yup wait i delete my string code
<bambanx>	how i can do for when i delete a div, it update the code too?
<cyberbrai>	falafel http://jsfiddle.net/q301p7af/ little confuse
<falafel>	cyberbrai, try asking in #jquery as this is jquery specific
<cyberbrai>	falafel i take append value in var
<falafel>	cyberbrai, try $(newRowContent).find('td a').on('click', reverse.bind(null, userName, Id))

<ashnur>	magic is probably the worst thing in programming because unlike many other enemies of good code, it's not obviously bad at first sight. junior developers often think they are being "clever" using less (more concise) code to do complicated sideeffects.

<Maxdamantus>	abstractions can make things more clear and less explicit.

<falafel>	rakm, learn about Promises, that's a way to unnest the code
<comingsoontm>	rakm, you can use setInterval, and count in variable the time it runs, the use clearInterval() to stop it, this is dirty but it´ll do the work
<comingsoontm>	rakm, the number of times it runs*
<ljharb>	!setInterval
<ecmabot>	ljharb: Avoid setInterval; use setTimeout instead. http://zetafleet.com/blog/why-i-consider-setinterval-harmful
<ljharb>	not setInterval.
<rakm>	i should probably use promises so I can chain them. that's effectively what I want
<comingsoontm>	lol I´m a dirty developer, second time I get grounded on 2 two times I provide a solution :P
<rakm>	i've always used promises constructed by 3rd party libs, never used the native api
<rakm>	i'll google around for that
<rakm>	thanks
<_rgn>	falafel: is it a coincidence that generators and yield can achieve something very similar haskell's do
<falafel>	_rgn, dda
<falafel>	oops
<falafel>	yeah, it works nicely though
<airdem>	can you help me with this vertical text? i cant make it align into the card http://jsfiddle.net/c2L8z52y/2/
<GreenJello>	airdem, try ##css
*	Tarmashirin is now known as kaplan
<rakm>	ok, I played around with promises for a little bit, but I am doing something wrong. can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/mehulkar/u8p6ykw1/2/
<falafel>	rakm, it is already in scope, you pass the arugment and capture it in a closure
<ljharb>	rakm: it's "resolve", not "fulfill", btw
<falafel>	logSomething(textToLog)
<falafel>	then just use `textToLog`
<ljharb>	rakm: but logSomething should take an argumnet
<ljharb>	*argument
<ljharb>	rakm: https://jsfiddle.net/u8p6ykw1/3/
<rakm>	ljharb: ok, so passing in the arg like that works. but how do I make it wait 1 second before logging each thing?
<rakm>	it looks like it logs all of them after the first 1s
*	comingsoontm_ is now known as comingsoontm
<ljharb>	rakm: because you're calling all 4 logSomethings immediately.
<rakm>	I guess, then .then() is what I was trying to use to have it wait one second, fulfill the promise, then call the next one
<ljharb>	rakm: you want https://jsfiddle.net/u8p6ykw1/4/ if you want to have them run in order.
<rakm>	oh hmm, I see the difference, not sure I understand how it's wired up though.
<rakm>	very cool, that works though
<RonRichie>	hey there!:)
<ljharb>	rakm: the way you had it before, it called all 4 logSomething functions immediately
<ljharb>	rakm: by wrapping it like that, it only calls it when the previous promise is resolved.
<RonRichie>	could you guys help me out with this simple code? I wonder what Im doing wrong with my simple callback function that it doesn't work? http://jsbin.com/sezekigeza/1/edit
<ljharb>	RonRichie: you're not passing console.log in
<ljharb>	RonRichie: you're passing the *return value* of console.log in. because "()" invokes the function.

<ljharb>	ok, tone it down
<ljharb>	RonRichie: `console.log;` is a noop.
<RonRichie>	ops, http://jsbin.com/sezekigeza/1/edit?js,output
<ljharb>	RonRichie: if you want `logIt` to take an argument, you need to make it take one.
<ljharb>	RonRichie: also, `console.log;` does nothing. if you want to invoke the method, use parens.
<Slut>	or you can do like
<RonRichie>	ljharb, i want to pass logIt as an argument to a `test` function, and i want logIt it to execute console.log on my test function
<Slut>	logit = console.log.bind(console);
<Slut>	logit('lol');
<devt204>	Slut it won't be just visual equalizer, there doesn't seem to be any open source / similar player that i can found around
<ljharb>	RonRichie: ok so then logIt needs to have an argument.
<ljharb>	RonRichie: and console.log needs to be executed. not just mentioned.
<Slut>	devt204: you can do pretty much anything really.
<comingsoontm>	RonRichie: your first code would work if you only remove the () from console.log, because you are passing the function not execeting it
<comingsoontm>	executing*

<ljharb>	chanced: ask in #jquery for the jquery part.
<chanced>	it doesnt need to be jquery
<ljharb>	chanced: but jquery has .text() and .html()
<chanced>	was just faster for me to type
<Slut>	comingsoontm: your face looks like.. things that faces shouldn't look like

<RonRichie>	I've found out a way of learning that really works for me:) when I write a code I try to explain it to myself the way it works and how it works by also reasoning the steps I took to write it, it in fact really helps lol :)
<chanced>	i have a bunch of html in a few files i need to update
<chanced>	it'd be easier if i could select it based on dom
<YolandaBCool>	RonRichie: I learn the same way, but you still need to know the basics
<RonRichie>	YolandaBCool well, I do actually know quite some of the basics and then some actually:) Im more interested in hard stuff at this point, hoisting, higher order function, call backs, apply bind and call and such :)
<chanced>	hmm, i wonder if i could do it with chrome
<RonRichie>	closures as well
<YolandaBCool>	RonRichie: none of that in that example is complex.
<YolandaBCool>	so maybe you just think you're smart.
<YolandaBCool>	it happens.
<YolandaBCool>	I recommend whiskey

<comingsoontm>	do you open the browser console to see the result ?
<comingsoontm>	RonRichie:
<falafel>	RonRichie, you probably don't need to check `callback`, the `typeof` check will cover the undefined case
<RonRichie>	comingsoontm I do this locally and then put it on jsbin, I do my testings in firebug
<falafel>	RonRichie, also note that `typeof` is a keyword, not a function
<falafel>	if (typeof callback === 'function')
<falafel>	that should do
<comingsoontm>	RonRichie: Ah okay that's why, because I see your links to jsbin open HTML, JS and Output but not Console
<comingsoontm>	RonRichie: You can do everything in Jsbin
<YolandaBCool>	RonRichie is too busy being advanced to worry about stuff like sharing links that are useful.
<RonRichie>	falafel aha, that makes sense, so the way I use typeof won't work?
<falafel>	RonRichie, it will, the parens are just not necessary
<RonRichie>	comingsoontm yeap, you are right:) its just doing it locally kind of make it a little easier
<falafel>	you can do `typeof(((((((callback)))))) === 'function'
<falafel>	same thing

<RonRichie>	falafel  comingsoontm could you guys confirm this for me? http://jsbin.com/dojefetite/1/edit?html,js,output is this out closures work right? i know its quite a simple sample but broadly put this is what a closure does right? thanks :)
<YolandaBCool>	'I know the basics' 'wait how does typeof work?'
<ljharb>	let's not mock people.
<ankr>	RonRichie I guess you can say yes, but what you have there probably falls in under the term "currying".
<RonRichie>	ankr ugh, gotta look up that one, never heard of that, thanks for clarifying though.
<ankr>	RonRichie currying requires closures
<_rgn>	is it currying if you can't satisfy all arguments with single call?
<YolandaBCool>	there will always be another argument
<YolandaBCool>	its impossible to satisfy all arguments with merely one telephone call
<ankr>	_rgn currying is taking a single function with multiple arguments and and turn it into multiple functions, each with a single argument.
<Johnade>	hi everyone
<comingsoontm>	hello
<greves>	oh no its another 'this' binding question! >.< hahaha
<xecycle>	ankr: not multiple functions.  still one function, that takes one argument and returns a function taking one argument and returns ...
<Johnade>	hi i have a question --> When we using backbone or ember, people can read source code to see how it's working no ?
<comingsoontm>	yes they can
<ankr>	Johnade when using javascript people can read the source code.
<xecycle>	_rgn: "if you can't satisfy all arguments with single call" looks more like partial application.
<Johnade>	ankr: thanks ankr, your right, it can be disturbing ...
<comingsoontm>	Johnade: I ran into this a while ago, I don´t think so, unless you have some private algorithm that you can hide on the server, you have (almost) nothing to fear of
<comingsoontm>	Johnade: also when you build the server side : never trust the front end. That was for the security part
<Johnade>	comingsoontm: thanks for you tips :)
<comingsoontm>	Johnade: also, try to go see the source code of something like gmail.com :D
<Johnade>	i'm making of craiglist kind of website, and for paiement and stuff i was wondering if i use backbone if it can disturb me for informations
<Johnade>	:p
<comingsoontm>	you gonna make your own payment platform ? That for it´s own needs another level of architecture
<Johnade>	no no, use paypal i guess
<Johnade>	i'm not so crazy :p
<comingsoontm>	then paypal will handle it I guess :) ?
<comingsoontm>	because you just click the pay button or whatever then the user go to a paypal page
<Johnade>	yes
<Johnade>	do you think that NodeJS mongodb and backbone for the gront is a good solution for this website ?
<xecycle>	I downvote mongodb before it gets full fledged transaction support.
<ankr>	sql ftw
<comingsoontm_>	Johnade: hmm did you say something ? I got disconnected
<Johnade>	xec:  ankr : so sql ?
<comingsoontm_>	sql for what ?
<Johnade>	comingsoontm: i was just asking if Nodejs/Mongodb and Bacbone for client side was a good solution
<comingsoontm_>	ah
<Johnade>	ankr and xecycle downvote mongodb
<comingsoontm_>	it could be, I don´t have enough infromation
<Johnade>	comingsoontm: it for a craiglist kind of website
<ankr>	Johnade I like to have everything in sql and the denormalize into elasticsearch(nosql) for the frontend.
<ankr>	then*
<comingsoontm_>	for starter, with nothing in mind, it´s whatever you find easy
<xecycle>	I upvote postgres.
<comingsoontm_>	if you will have normalized stuff ill go with sql
<Johnade>	what do you mean for "normalized"
<Johnade>	the thing it's that i will use a restful api, and data will be JSON
*	steelbrain__ is now known as steelbrain
<xecycle>	relational DB for relational data --- data that relates to each other in some well-defined way.
<comingsoontm>	Johnade: im sorry i keep getting disconnected, can´t always trust powerline and ISPs...
<Johnade>	comingsoontm: okay np :) , i said -> what do you mean for "normalized" ? The thing it's that i will use a restful api and -->JSON
<comingsoontm>	yeah but restful api and json output doesnt matter here
<comingsoontm>	let´s say you will have different product that are on the website, about 250 kind of products, and each one have it´s own attributes
<Johnade>	yes
<comingsoontm>	I think it´s easier to put that in mongodb, than to create a table with thousands of columns, and have product with NULL everywhere
<comingsoontm>	or have a lot of tables relating to each product idk
<comingsoontm>	maybe xecycle can answer that
<Johnade>	okay i see, i will just have people that create their own ads with posting some photos , and paid for premium service that's all
<Johnade>	upload of files (photo) , paiement with paypal, and store just ads from people
<xecycle>	ok continue with that example.  do you want something stored with a "kind"?  so that each product point to one (or more) "kind", and related data automatically comes related.
<xecycle>	this is relational data.
<Johnade>	each ads will have a description, and people will add his phone number and mail adress
<comingsoontm>	xecycle:  I have a little lazy bias, like I get lazy for the machine... but having a product table, then a 250 tables for each type of products, isn´t that a lot ?
<xecycle>	but if you store "kind" together with each product, ignoring any relations of the "kind"s, these are flat out unrelated.
<comingsoontm>	xecycle: yeah if he neas to store some data that doens´t need to be searched or sorted by, he can JSON it and put it in one column right ?
<xecycle>	comingsoontm: then you have to encode "kind" information in code.  code may bloat, to some unknown degree.
<xecycle>	searching/sorting does not matter that much.
<xecycle>	relational is more about logical data model.
<comingsoontm>	yeah but if you want to search the product with Color:red, if the color:red is in json as a stirng in column, you can´t easly search it, unless you do in text search and that´s heavy
<xecycle>	say, a forum, storing users and posts --- you naturally point to the posting user in each post.  this is a relation.
<comingsoontm>	in a* column
<Johnade>	yes but in my case
<Johnade>	i think it's really simple
<comingsoontm>	yes I get you but that´s simple
<xecycle>	well, above "relation" not same as the "relation" in RDBMS theory
<xecycle>	it's about pieces of data relating to each other, logically.
<comingsoontm>	I don´t understand your point because yes I agree with what you are saying it´s correct
<Sky_Symbol>	Hi guys, i have a javascript file with content really compressed. All is in one line without spaces, how can i make the file more readable? thanks
<Kattkunskap>	Sky_Symbol: http://jsbeautifier.org/
<xecycle>	working with relational data, you must take care to keep integrity of relations; and this problem has been studied for decades in RDBMS.  going nosql you must solve them manually; if the relations are weak or very easy to follow, you may feel better with nosql, but otherwise you're unlikely to beat those mature RDBMS.
<michaelis>	Hi. Please take a look at http://pastebin.com/NL4JhVTf . In the "mousemove" event on s.node the .top and .left props of getBoundingClientRect() shows the right value every second move. Otherwise it jumps 100-200 pixels giving a really strange result. Any ideas?
<comingsoontm_>	yes true, I had this problem with mongodb, and you have to keep going relation by relation and populating each relation of data
<Sky_Symbol>	works perfectly. thanks!
<comingsoontm_>	but xecycle when I was talking it was about sql, if you want to have many kinds of product, are you gonna store them in 1 table and have many columns NULL for a lot of products ?
<comingsoontm_>	like if you have cars and computers, Ghz is irrelevent for a car
<comingsoontm_>	xecycle:
<xecycle>	comingsoontm_: table product (products), table kind (kinds), table product_kind(product-kind relation)
<comingsoontm_>	yes I did that in a website, is it fine to have a lot of tables ? VS nosql :P ?

<shyam>	hey is there something that flattens out arrays on build? say I have `[1,2,3].map(function(val){return val+1;});` and I would like to convert that to `234`. Maybe a gulp task or someting? I'm not exactly sure what the terminology for what I want is, cos Google doesn't seem to be helping me. Again I'm thinking this from a React-ish point of view.
<inimino>	shyam: what you want is code generation
<inimino>	shyam: but why do you want that?
<Rainb>	Can you find a value on the array for the n time
<Elirips>	Hello. I am preloading images using something like 'var img = new Image; img.onload = function(event) { // do something }; img.src = "myimg.jpg"; - What is the best way to copy the image in the onload() handler to an actual html <img> tag?
<Elirips>	with best I mean: A way that ensures that the browser does not send another request
<shyam>	inimino: dynamic React page. Everything is determined from JSON. So each component may have sub-components(again dynamic) and so on. So the higher ups asked if it was possible to convert all the `.map` functions into their corresponding output before serving to the user. Less functions more performant.. I guess thats what they were ultimately going for
<moep>	hi
<inimino>	shyam: ah... you can render the whole thing on the server, sure
<shyam>	that would output the entire thing as a string of react components.
<inimino>	shyam: React.renderToHTML(...)
<inimino>	hm
<inimino>	Elirips: isn't the point of preloading that the browser caches it?
<shyam>	inimino: yes html. But I just want the js versions of these
<inimino>	Elirips: in any case, of course that *is* an image element, that's why it works, so you can just insert it into the document
<inimino>	shyam: it's not possible in general in JavaScript because it's quite dynamic
<inimino>	shyam: you could replace Array.prototype.map() before calling that, for example
<shyam>	:D so my thinking was right.
<inimino>	shyam: so anything you do would have to be written for yourself, and the idea that unrolling .map() calls is going to save performance sounds ridiculous anyway
<shyam>	uhm... but is that a recommended way? replacing a native function?
<inimino>	I'm not suggesting you do that
<ankr>	I would say it's discouraged.
<shyam>	inimino: uhm... no... I think you misunderstand. I would parse the file. Convert the map into the flat versions and serve that rather than go crazy :P
<inimino>	if you have a problem with page load time there's almost certainly a better solution
<inimino>	yeah, I got that
<shyam>	ah k
<inimino>	I'm just explaining why there can never be a general-purpose tool that does what you want
<_rgn>	shyam: do you have a performance issue?
<inimino>	since in general it's impossible to what what [].map will be until runtime
<inimino>	to know what [].map will be
<Rainb>	you can know the type right
<shyam>	_rgn: haven't implemented anything yet... still sorta info gathering phase
<inimino>	why do you think that sending a bigger file to the browser will improve your page load time?
<inimino>	did you do some profiling on this idea?
<inimino>	shyam: find out how much time your code spends in Array.prototype.map compared to DOM rendering and network overhead
<shyam>	inimino: you can do that? how? I've never actually understood the Chrome profiler so I don't know how it works. Or is there other profilers that you suggest
<shyam>	*are
<inimino>	sure, you can see the network calls measured in milliseconds
<inimino>	and in a profile, you just start the profiler, load your page, and look at the profile
<inimino>	you can see all the functions and the total time spent in them
<inimino>	probably more easily measured in microseconds
<inimino>	shyam: if that doesn't work for you you can also just put Date.now() calls around your .map() lines and subtract
<inimino>	and if that still doesn't work you can manually run your .map() in the console and paste the result back into your file and then compare
<shyam>	console.time? is that similar? I had heard about somewhere
<sonthonax>	In es6 does ‘…’ before a variable mean anything?
<inimino>	shyam: there's performance.now
<inimino>	sonthonax: no, it's just decorative
<falafel>	sonthonax, rest and spread
<inimino>	shyam: I don't know about console.time
<sonthonax>	Well a cursory google search explains it.
<shyam>	falafel: I was informed yesterday that its part of the es7 specs not es6. No?
<falafel>	rest and spread are es6
<ShotokanZH>	hi guys
<inimino>	yes it's in ES6
<Elirips>	inimino: Is there any difference for the browser wheter I replace an existing <img> with the Image(), or if I just update the src attribute of the existing <img> element with the value from the just loaded image?
<inimino>	Elirips: no difference
<Elirips>	inimino: I'm not 100% sure if the browser really caches the image in all cases. What would happen if the header containts things like 'no-cache, expire-time: 0', etc. when the image gets loaded? will the browser still cache it?
<inimino>	it can't not cache the image data because there's an image object on the page that it might have to display
<inimino>	it may not cache it in the disk cache
<Elirips>	inimino: ah okay, thank you. makes sense and matches what I see in wireshark
<inimino>	sure
<Fodd>	Hey guys. I've got a JS IF statement problem.
<Fodd>	http://pastebin.com/p9MvYt9v - my php returns either red or green
<Fodd>	if i make it return green, i still dont get an alert
<Fodd>	however, the else works and the font-weight is normal.
<Havvy>	1. Prefer `console.log()` over `alert()`.
<Fodd>	however, if i run an alert(); on the else statement. it says green
<Havvy>	2. `console.log(typeof data);` before the `if`.
<Havvy>	If that doesn't log "string", that's your issue.
<Fodd>	thank you havvy for helping
<saltypancakes>	don't forget console.dir
<Havvy>	Ctrl+shift+j (or k) to open up the dev console.
<Fodd>	it says string
<Fodd>	im using chrome console if that helps
*	dust--_ is now known as dust--
<Fodd>	this is my first project with javascript/ajax :)
<Havvy>	Fodd:  Now what about `console.log("'" + data + "'");`?
<Fodd>	'
<Fodd>	green'
<Fodd>	seems like theres a return in there
<Havvy>	Any whitespace outside of a <?php ?> tag is placed into the output document.
<Fodd>	the data being sent from PHP is `return 'green';` so there shouldn't be a extra line
<Fodd>	Nope, no white space
<Havvy>	There's no echo?
<Havvy>	Or is it <?= return 'green' ?>
<Fodd>	i echo out a class i've made
<Fodd>	echo thefunction();
<CasW>	Hey guys, if I do ChildClass = {}; ChildClass.prototype = new SuperClass(); can I then use the constructor from SuperClass to create a ChildClass object by invoking new ChildClass()? Or how should I do that, since it doesn't seem to work
<Havvy>	CasW:  No. You'd do `SuperClass.call(this)` as the first line in ChildClass  (and ChildClass must be a function for the pattern you are thinking of.)
<falafel>	unction ChildClass(){}; ChildClass.prototype=Object.create(SuperClass.prototype)
<falafel>	*f
<falafel>	don't use `new SuperClass` as that can have unintended side-effects, use Object.create
<CasW>	Hmm, unintended side-effects? Could you give me a link to an article or something about that?
<Nazral>	can a method have the same name as a field in an object ?
<falafel>	CasW, just imagine if `SuperClass` has side-effects, for example changing a variable outside of it's scope
<falafel>	*its
<Nazral>	like can I have function Obj(t) { this.t = t }; Obj.prototype.t = function(t) { this.t = t; }
<falafel>	Object.create won't execute the constructor function CasW
<CasW>	Aah, okay, I can see that. Thanks! :) I learned something today. It still doesn't work, though; does SuperClass.call(this) invoke the constructor of SuperClass, and does it do so with some parameters?
<falafel>	!oop @ CasW
<ecmabot>	CasW: http://robotlolita.me/2011/10/09/understanding-javascript-oop.html summarizes Object Oriented Programming in Javascript, using concepts from ECMAScript 5, and relating them back to older paradigms from ECMAScript 3
<inimino>	Nazral: no
<falafel>	CasW, that's a good read, it covers everything you want to know about prototypes and inheritance and such
<CasW>	Ah, nice, thanks! I'll read it through
<Nazral>	inimino: ok thanks :)
<inimino>	Nazral: and we call them properties, not fields
<inimino>	A method is just a property that is a function
<falafel>	constructors and methods are just regular functions, and `this` depends on the caller, that's all there is to it, why it causes so much confusion I'm not sure...
<Kartagis>	how should I read a js file? I mean, how can I find out what the trigger and the methods are?
<falafel>	Kartagis, in the browser?
<Kartagis>	falafel: I tried that, typing nameofscript didn't produce anything
<falafel>	I mean, in the browser or node?
<falafel>	Kartagis, and what do you mean by "read"?
<Kartagis>	oh, as a text file
<Kartagis>	read as in read the code
<inimino>	what falafel wants to know is what the file is for
<inimino>	where will it be run?
<falafel>	yes, and why as a text file
<inimino>	is it a browser script? a commonjs module?
<inimino>	something else?
<Kartagis>	falafel: I just want to find out its methods
<falafel>	so static analysis?
<Kartagis>	this is lightbox.js
<inimino>	ok, so it's a library for use in the browser
<falafel>	we are getting somewhere now...
<Nazral>	inimino: my bad
<falafel>	find out what methods?
<Kartagis>	like initiate, and close, and use prev and next
<falafel>	Kartagis, if you want to read as text you can use AJAX
<falafel>	or the FileAPI
<inimino>	not that kind of reading
<inimino>	reading as in reading a book
<Kartagis>	falafel: no you got it wrong (or I wasn't clear). I want to read the code to find out the methods
<falafel>	ah
<falafel>	Kartagis, open devtools, go to sources
<inimino>	Kartagis: just start at the top, read all the function names, and then read the important functions
<falafel>	is that what you mean?
<falafel>	debugging code?
<inimino>	no...
<Kartagis>	okay. how are methods specified in a js file?
<inimino>	Kartagis: if you just want to know how to use it, the docs are a better choice
<inimino>	a file doesn't have methods
<Kartagis>	lightbox is an object, no?
<inimino>	probably
<inimino>	it's probably a single object with various properties
<falafel>	https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/blob/master/js/lightbox.js
<falafel>	Ligthbox.prototype.method
<inimino>	mmm
<greensky>	I  will pay $30 for what I believe is literally 3 minutes work.  I want to wrap 3 includes into modules using either requirejs or commonjs. I have the simple code on github.  Can someone pm please ASAP.

<michaelis>	Hi. Please take a look at http://pastebin.com/NL4JhVTf . In the "mousemove" event on s.node the .top and .left props of getBoundingClientRect() shows the right value every second move. Otherwise it jumps 100-200 pixels giving a really strange result. Any ideas?
<michaelis>	And the next move shows thousands of pixels wrong.
<inimino>	greensky: (a) it's not three minutes work, and (b) you can probably do it yourself
<inimino>	michaelis: make a jsfiddle and cut it down to 20-30 lines and people will be more likely to help
<greensky>	inimino i know but i spent a day on it bro
<greensky>	im 99% there
<greensky>	but i need to be 100% there
<xec>	I estimate a 99% chance that your percentages are made up ;)
<hellyeah>	hey
<hellyeah>	do i have to know javascript with deep knowledghe to write client side validation?
<hooloovoo1>	hellyeah: Not really.
<inimino>	greensky: I'm sure someone can finish up that remaining 1% in three minutes then *rolls eyes*
<greensky>	i estimate xec is correct with 61% certainty
<hellyeah>	hooloovoo1: how so? Can you explain or gie me some tutorial?
<hooloovoo1>	hellyeah: Do you know javascript at all?
<hellyeah>	not much
<ankr>	I'm 90% sure I just saw Jake Gyllenhaal on the subway.
<CasW>	"This parent chain is defined by a hidden slot in every object, called [⁣[Prototype]⁣]. You can't change this slot directly4, so the only way of setting it is when you're creating a fresh object. " Hmm, falafel, in that link you sent they say this, but isn't the [[Prototype]] object just located at obj.prototype? The way I do inheritance now, is just by setting obj.prototype to a new instance of the super class...
<hooloovoo1>	hellyeah: You could just use a library for it. jQuery has jQuery-validate, and there's lots others. Just google and see which fits you.
<Sorella>	CasW: no, obj.prototype is just a regular property that contains an object. And it's only used in a special way when you use `new Constructor`
<falafel>	CasW, [[Prototype]] is the internal property, exposed in some environments as __proto__. The `prototype` property of a function is a just a regular object, that acts as a blueprint for the __proto__ of new objects
<CasW>	Aah, so obj.prototype is actually only used if you call new obj?
<falafel>	yes
<CasW>	Okay, that explains it, thanks :)
<michaelis>	inimino, Ok. I have done that that.
<Kartagis>	it's surprising that console doesn't offer $.lightbox or $.Lightbox
<michaelis>	Hi. Please take a look at https://jsfiddle.net/c4rnc6p2/1/ . In the "mousemove" event on s.node the .top and .left props of getBoundingClientRect() shows the right value every second move. Otherwise it jumps 100-200 pixels giving a really strange result. Any ideas?
<ankr>	michaelis your example is not complete
<michaelis>	ankr, No it isn't because I was told to shorten it to 20-30 lines.
<inimino>	michaelis: sorry for not being clear, I meant that you should shorten while still demonstrating the problem
<ankr>	michaelis You need to reproduce the problem with as little code as possible
<inimino>	the point in using jsfiddle is that people can actually see the issue
<inimino>	!testcase
<michaelis>	inimino, Sorry for me not understanding.
<ecmabot>	inimino: Show some code, but don't paste it on the channel. Sites like http://gist.github.com/ and http://bpaste.net/ are cool. You can also use http://jsbin.com , http://requirebin.com or http://jsfiddle.net/ to provide a test case we can run and help you with your problem.
<inimino>	that's not the botfact I wanted
<inimino>	!minimal
<ecmabot>	inimino: A minimal test case should contain precisely the HTML and JavaScript necessary to demonstrate the problem, no more and no less. If the JavaScript is more than 42 lines, it is probably not a minimal test case.
<ankr>	michaelis at least you try ;) opposite to certain others
<inimino>	that one ^
<inimino>	michaelis: put some elements in your HTML, get rid of the dependencies on that snap thing, and attach the event listener and produce some output, then people can load the jsfiddle and see the problem directly
<michaelis>	inimino, But what if the problem is related to snap?
<inimino>	michaelis: then that's the most useful information you could possibly get out of this exercise
<inimino>	then you either don't use snap, use it differently, or send your testcase to them as a bug report
<michaelis>	inimino, I will do what you have suggested.
<AlphaAtom>	what is considered best practice for binding a click event with jQuery?
<michaelis>	inimino, The funny thing is that getBoundingClientRect is producing such a strange result and I don't really now how to reproduce it without snap. I don't know if the bug belongs to snap och mozilla.
<michaelis>	s/och/or
<mRCUTEO2>	i want to load 2 id field on a onload event but only one work this is my script:
<mRCUTEO2>	$(document).ready(function(){     $('#Sub_Item').change(), $('#Item_Warranty').change(); });
<inimino>	michaelis: well assuming that s.node is just a DOM element, you can probably literally replace it with document.getElementById() and make your test case
<mRCUTEO2>	only su_item works on change
<mRCUTEO2>	anyone knows how can i make both function work at the same time?
<inimino>	good luck :)
<michaelis>	inimino, I think I understand. I will try it out.
<yansanmo>	mRCUTEO2, I don't see a problem: http://jsfiddle.net/g561xx5w/
<mRCUTEO2>	yansanmo: only sub_item will load but not item_warranty
<yansanmo>	I got "changed!" in both
<Karasu>	If i use if(!myString){ code;} it will excecute when myString is either undefined/null AND when it's an empty string '', right?
<ilhami>	doug16k, ? :P
<saltypancakes>	falsy values in js just remember F U N N 0 "", false undefined, null, NaN, "", 0
<zivc>	f u ilhami
<ilhami>	zivc, what?
<inimino>	!truthy
<ecmabot>	inimino: The 'falsy' values in JavaScript are undefined, null, 0, -0, NaN, '', and false. The 'truthy' values are all other values. All objects are truthy. There is nothing both truthy and falsy, or neither truthy nor falsy.
<michaelis>	ankr, inimino Ok, so I removed the snap library and I cannot reproduce the problem. This suggests that the problem is with the snap library. Thank you for your help.

<Naeblis>	Hi. If I have a regex /foo/i inside a json config as string, how can I re-create it as a RegExp object inside my JS? I seem to be getting an extra backslash at the beginning and end of the regex.
<serses>	how do i increment my array and then square it? http://jsbin.com/digevuhiza/1/edit?js,console
<buu>	Naeblis: eval
<Naeblis>	buu: thanks!
<buu>	-_-
<buu>	serses: what is this .pipe thing?
<serses>	i try to to chain them together
<serses>	first add one to elements of the array and then square them
<buu>	serses: var res = arr.map(add).map(square);
<serses>	well that is too easy
<buu>	oh
<serses>	i need it with the pipe
<buu>	I can make it harder
<buu>	You haven't told me what pipe is supposed to do
<buu>	serses: You want it to curry the function?
<serses>	yes
<buu>	or rather, act as a combinator?
<buu>	uh
<buu>	sigh
<serses>	something like a function concatenation
<buu>	I'm sure there's a lisp function for this
<inimino>	Naeblis: or put "foo" and "i" separately in your JSON and then use the RegExp constructor
<buu>	serses: http://jsbin.com/segemifici/1/
<buu>	uh
<adrianr1>	blah blah
<buu>	did that save changes? How the fuck does jsbin work
<adrianr1>	ok, can talk
<serses>	yes
<serses>	that works thanks
<buu>	uh
<buu>	ok
<serses>	what if i do bind(this)
<buu>	no idea
<serses>	on returning function
<buu>	absolutely none
<serses>	that would probably work
<inimino>	I don't get what your pipe() function is trying to do
<buu>	mapcar
<buu>	or something
<inimino>	is it just function composition?
<serses>	something like pipe from shell
<serses>	ls | sort | head
<inimino>	ok
<buu>	that's.. not the same
<buu>	also .map already works that way
<inimino>	compose(f,g)(x) = f(g(x))
<inimino>	add.pipe(square)
<inimino>	this already exists and is called composition
<_rgn>	i guess only kind of expression you could realistically unroll is [a, b, c].map(f) to [f(a), f(b), f(c)]
<buu>	Function COMPOSE Syntax: compose &rest functions => composite-function Arguments and Values: functions---a list of designators for functions. composite-function---a function created by composing functions. Description: compose returns a function which is created by composing functions right-associatively.
<inimino>	not the same as piping, since pipes operate on streams
<buu>	Oh god
<serses>	i said something like pipe
<serses>	not pipe
<buu>	serses: http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Function_composition here you go
<inimino>	yes, I'm just describing the difference
<serses>	C++ X_x
<buu>	You could hypothetically write streamprovider(foo).pipe(one).pipe(two);
<buu>	And have streamprovider return an object that lazily evaluates foo
<inimino>	but what you want here is just .map(compose(f,g))
<inimino>	function compose(f,g){return function(x){return f(g(x))}}
<inimino>	serses: then compose(square,add) will do what you wanted your pipe to do
<serses>	so if i have 3 functions :  comspose(compose(a,b), c) ?
<inimino>	sure
<inimino>	make it variadic if you want
<buu>	functions.forEach(function(f){res=f(res)}) ?
<inimino>	that's a way
*	lance|afk is now known as lanceball
<emehrkay>	what are functions/objects called that are created with the new keyword vs ones that are just called directly
<inimino>	emehrkay: there's no general term for that
<inimino>	just objects
<inimino>	but you could call them instances if you wanted to
<emehrkay>	I am writing documentation for adding mixins to an object. It of course accepts object literals, but it can accept instantiated  functions as well. Tricky
<inimino>	emehrkay: so it accepts an object
<emehrkay>	right, thanks.
<inimino>	emehrkay: if additional clarification is needed, you can say what happens when the object has a prototype that is not Object.prototype
<emehrkay>	good point, I will add that. Thank you
<hellyeah>	can ican i write script for server-side validation with javascript?
<ankr>	hellyeah if you run javascript server side, yes
<hellyeah>	hmm
<hellyeah>	ankr: you mean running js at domain
<hellyeah>	?
<jaawerth>	hellyeah: this basically amounts to using node, or a server with a javascript interpreter (like rhino or nashorn running in java)
<hellyeah>	what about c#
<hellyeah>	does c# has something for that?
<jaawerth>	uhh well I think .NET has a javascript interpreter called Jint. Never used it though, have no idea how good it is
<ankr>	hellyeah what exactly do you want to achieve?
<hellyeah>	well
<jaawerth>	haha good question
<hellyeah>	asp.net has some validation function
<hellyeah>	like
<hellyeah>	sorry property
<hellyeah>	like controltovalidate
<hellyeah>	i wonder can i write this validation process with java script
<jaawerth>	hellyeah: you might want to look into https://github.com/sebastienros/jint . At a glance it doesn't look as powerful as, say, node, but it will at least let you execute basic scripts
<jaawerth>	(and tie into your .net API)
<hellyeah>	i think nuget must have jint
<xec>	hellyeah: ankr asked you the most relevant question so far - what are you really trying to do
<hellyeah>	xec:
<hellyeah>	just try to learn validation process
<hellyeah>	using asp.net here
<hellyeah>	they have tons of function, property etc.
<hellyeah>	i wonder writing those validation process with javascript does it make any difference?
<xec>	are you using MVC?

<hellyeah>	no*
<Hannibal_Smith>	hellyeah, .Net developers migrated times ago to mvc, and now they will migrate to web api
<hellyeah>	first need to learn web forms then mvc then web api
<hellyeah>	i guess
<yansanmo>	not really
<hellyeah>	my process will be like that
<xec>	hellyeah: not if you don't have to work son existing projects
<yansanmo>	you can learn javascript, without learning js for ie4/ns4

<jaawerth>	aw you mean I should throw away my book on CGI bin?
<jaawerth>	;-)
<hellyeah>	actually fine
<hellyeah>	easy concept so far
<inimino>	a time traveler!
<hellyeah>	dont throw away any book :XD
<yansanmo>	burn them!

<hellyeah>	what about node.js
<hellyeah>	can i write node.js for server side validation?
<yansanmo>	xqo, getter
<jaawerth>	hellyeah: node.js is a javascript server, so yes. you can write node.js for server-side everything
<xec>	hellyeah: if you're starting at a company that requested you learn webforms, i don't suggest you start with learning node.js ;)
<jaawerth>	but node has a learning curve because of its async nature

<mbrzuzy>	No man, I always get that reaction but think about it. It has everything you need to learn, it can be as complicated or as simple as you want it to be
<Krakox>	mbrzuzy: I'm here to learn JS, not to change language :D
<mbrzuzy>	It has data types, functions, objects
<mbrzuzy>	Krakox, I misunderstood what you were saying then :)
<inimino>	yeah, but seriously, it's a terrible first language
<RedWraith>	JavaScript actually seems very strange to me as a choice for first language
<inimino>	and it was my first language
<RedWraith>	it does a lot of things that seem to defy how other languages behave, at least compiled ones
<mbrzuzy>	inimino, me too, curious why you think it's a bad choice though
<inimino>	mbrzuzy: it's about 100x bigger than a first language should be
<mbrzuzy>	You wouldn't be expected to learn the whole thing, i meant using it to learn programming concepts and techniques
<inimino>	mbrzuzy: Scheme, Python, C, MMIX, Prolog, lua, JavaScript would all be better choices
<inimino>	If you want a language that's feature-complete and still designed for learners, that would be Oz.
<Krakox>	inimino:I want learn an useful language :D
<mbrzuzy>	I don't disagree with those, but I do disagree with javascript because in my opinion, people wouldn't develop good programming habits
<Krakox>	so JavaScript is cool, C seems too
<xqo>	hi, my setter function is giving me maximum call stack exceeded: http://jsfiddle.net/pu5oo01v/1/
<Krakox>	but I'm here to have your opinion about "JavaScript for Kids"
<inimino>	C is a good first language if you have a good teacher, otherwise you're likely to get frustrated
<inimino>	I haven't heard of that book.
<Krakox>	http://www.nostarch.com/javascriptforkids
<Krakox>	I love this editor, but I don't know if it is a good book
<mbrzuzy>	Krakox, I got us sidetracked. Sorry for taking over your question
<Krakox>	:P
<Krakox>	Oh! That is the same editor as Eloquent books!
<inimino>	Krakox: I don't know, it looks like fluffy examples making simple games. It's for kids 10+ (and their parents!)
<inimino>	You can try the free sample chapter and see if it holds your interest.
<inimino>	It's also using jQuery which maybe isn't the best introduction.
<Krakox>	vanilla js forever?
<inimino>	libraries are great, I just don't happen to like that one in particular
<mbrzuzy>	depends on if your goal is to teach the person programming itsself or javascript specifically
*	Torkable is now known as Guest79124
<bberry>	how about haskell?
<Krakox>	I want learn JavaScript and after learn node.js to do Web app
<inimino>	the jQuery is probably just in there for things like adding click handlers, so it doesn't really matter
<inimino>	I'd suggest Eloquent over this, though.
<bberry>	^
<inimino>	Or even better try something like The Little Schemer first, and then Eloquent.
<mbrzuzy>	Krakox, I would suggest to avoid javascript and just find a book on programming concepts and logic
<mbrzuzy>	javascript is kind of stupid with how it works most of the time
<hellyeah>	can i learn node.js after finishing elaquent javascript
<inimino>	I strongly disagree with that...
<Krakox>	hellyeah: What have you used to learn JS?
<inimino>	JavaScript is a good language, it does have a couple quirks, such as how the Date objects work, but nothing that's going to do lasting damage
<Sorella>	inimino: That JavaScript is stupid, or to find a book on programming concepts and logic?
<inimino>	Sorella: That JavaScript is stupid.
<mbrzuzy>	inimino, I chose my words very poorly
<Sorella>	Oh, okay. I disagree with both :D
<inimino>	I think it's actually an excellent introductory language.
<hellyeah>	i just will learn it
<hellyeah>	i plan to read elaquent javascript
<hellyeah>	and may be one more book
<inimino>	it's eloquent, with an 'o', btw
<inimino>	Sorella: I agree with the advice of buying a book.
<hellyeah>	sorry
<mbrzuzy>	And as an FYI, I love javascript
<mbrzuzy>	probably one of my favorite programming languages
<Sorella>	I don't think JS is a good language, but I don't think it's stupid either. I'd definitely not choose it as an introductory language, because it makes some concepts hard to teach.
<mbrzuzy>	I'd agree with that
<mbrzuzy>	I think you hit the nail on the head Sorella
<Sorella>	You can choose a subset, but meh. I'd rather have something that fits better there, like Racket (also because feedback in Dr Racket is much better)
<inimino>	The typical C++ introduction is going to spend 2 months learning OO principles, which is a huge waste of effort.
<inimino>	Yeah, a Scheme is fine, if you have the patience to start that way.
<hellyeah>	drracket
*	Cyndre is now known as Guest37926
<hellyeah>	what
<hellyeah>	what does it have
<hellyeah>	this language sucks
<inimino>	...?
<inimino>	what are you trying to say?
<mbrzuzy>	lol
<Sorella>	This is one of the reasons I'm writing Mermaid. You can learn the concepts JS uses, right in your browser, with a good interface/feedback similar to DrRacket's, and then it's just a question of adapting to a new syntax if you want to move to JS
<hellyeah>	i guess
<hellyeah>	to execute javascript on server side
<inimino>	Krakox: so do you have any conclusion?
<hellyeah>	you need to implement something with ajax
<Temur>	Sorella, what's mermaid?
<hellyeah>	or you need node.js
<hellyeah>	am i wrong?
<inimino>	yes
<inimino>	ajax has nothing to do with executing JavaScript on the server
<Sorella>	Temur: a Smalltalk/JS inspired programming language + programming environment for teaching introductory programming courses.
<Temur>	Sorella, link?
<Krakox>	inimino: I will learn JS with kids and after eloquent 'cause it is the same editor so I think that difficulty increase progressively
<mbrzuzy>	Sorella, do you have a site going for that? Seems like it could be a really good teaching tool
<Sorella>	Temur: https://github.com/mermaid-language/mermaid (only the language is done right now, but then I started it this sunday)
<hellyeah>	so ineed node.js right
<Sorella>	I plan on writing the programming environment over May
<inimino>	Krakox: If I were you I'd start with eloquent first, and see if you get stuck.
<hellyeah>	what about
<hellyeah>	javascript for dummies
<hellyeah>	:XD
<Temur>	Eloquent is kinda hard starting from chapter 5
<Krakox>	inimino: oh, good idea! :D
<inimino>	Krakox: then you can either try to get unstuck or switch to the other book
<hellyeah>	why it is hard after chapter 5
<hellyeah>	?
<hellyeah>	Concept hard
<hellyeah>	or
<hellyeah>	not clear explanation in the book?
<inimino>	it gets into functional programming kind of suddenly
<bberry>	hellyeah, the former
<inimino>	you must do some hard thinking or have some other background to keep up
<Temur>	hellyeah, the concept of higher order functions is hard to wrap your head around
<inimino>	but it's not unmanageable
<Krakox>	notice: I'm not a native speaker, so eloquent isn't too hard to read?
<hellyeah>	ic
<Temur>	fortunately I started programming with lisp(racket)
<inimino>	the English is not difficult
<hellyeah>	suppose higher order function is functional programming thing
<hellyeah>	i did some drscheme
<hellyeah>	but i feel fishy about rememebering that concept
<hellyeah>	i hard new js has oo concept
<hellyeah>	what the hell javascript do with fp concept
<inimino>	... you should work on your English
<mbrzuzy>	lol
<Krakox>	inimino: I know, that is why I will read a programming book in english :)
<Sorella>	JS is influenced by Scheme (which Racket also takes most of its influence from), and Self. So, there's a lot of higher-order programming stuff in JS
<inimino>	Krakox: no, I meant that for hellyeah, actually your (written) English seems fine :)
<hellyeah>	sorry
<hellyeah>	:D
<Krakox>	oh :D thanks :P
<hellyeah>	sorry for my english
<inimino>	it's not that it's ungrammatical, it's just that you use profanity like a middle school student

<AlphaAtom>	would someone mind querying me with a nice js library for smooth scrolling and perhaps highlighting elements depending on where stuff is
<WajidKagzi>	I am new to javascript, do you veterans use the google conosle mainly for coding?
<ankr>	google console?
<WajidKagzi>	um the developer kit?
<Naeblis>	I think he means devtools
<WajidKagzi>	oh yes
<WajidKagzi>	thank you Naeblis
<ankr>	WajidKagzi I use it for debugging, not actual coding.
<ankr>	Or when I just want to whip up a quick little script
<WajidKagzi>	I am from a ruby background so I was wondering do you use any REPL? besides node
<WajidKagzi>	thanks ankr
<cjohnson>	npm is a pretty great repository of packages
<cjohnson>	and with browserify you can use most of them in the browser
<jaawerth>	WajidKagzi: it's still node, but I use babel's REPL (babel-node) quite a bit
<jaawerth>	WajidKagzi: it's pretty handy to save space in a REPL by using arrow functions
<WajidKagzi>	oooo cool thanks jaawerth and cjohnson
<WajidKagzi>	any other tools that I should know about?
<arkin>	Can someone point me in the direction of a really good javascript chart library for a lot of data e.g. if i want to show a years worth of data on a line chart?
<ankr>	WajidKagzi yeah you'd probably want to checkout npm and bower for dependency management.
<WajidKagzi>	D3.js is generally good for large amounts of data arkin
<jaawerth>	d3 is really powerful and great, but it's also not very charts-out-of-the-box, it requires a fair bit of coding and design
<cythrawll>	oh no not coding!
<ankr>	WajidKagzi an Gulp/Grunt/etc for build tasks (I prefer Gulp).
<jaawerth>	lol
<arkin>	Most libraries can handle it, just a years worth in 900px sometimes looks messed up
<macabre>	anyone have experience with flot charts? i'm having some sort of stacking issue? i have a chart with bar and line charts and for some reason when i add the lines it stacks against the bar charts.. it's a little weird to explain so heres a pic: https://www.dropbox.com/s/wfr6xl71lvvswsd/Screen%20Shot%202015-04-29%20at%209.34.55%20AM.png?dl=0
<jaawerth>	well it's a fair caveat. d3 is fantastic for building charts but you're still doing it largely by hand compared to some of the more abstracted libs. both are legitimate use-cases depending on how much time you have
<jaawerth>	I'll sometimes use a more abstract lib like nvd3 or highcharts for rapid prototyping and then refactor it with hand-designed d3
<arkin>	yea have had good experience with highcharts
<arkin>	nvd3 looks good too, ill check that out
<arkin>	I'm graphing impressions over time, simple stuff
*	zz_robotmayo is now known as robotmayo
<jaawerth>	arkin: I remember at one point chatting in another channel with the guy who originally wrote nvd3 (and had since left the company that maintains it).

<Sorella>	(Though Github still makes it work for them)
<willv2>	Guest20: Although yansanmo ha s apoint
<Sorella>	(I refuse to believe that Ruby's official implementation is slower than the current implementation of Mermaid though)

<Guest20>	willv2: great!!!
<Guest20>	looks good
<Guest20>	but one thing: how to elimanate the match #4?
<yoshokatana>	ruby might be a little slow for some things, but it's always a tradeoff between speed and accessibility, right?
<Guest20>	the last match is ''
<yoshokatana>	otherwise we'd all still be writing machine code
<Sorella>	yoshokatana: yeah. Ruby is a neat language (too much magic and awful ways of doing reflection though)
<inimino>	http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64/compare.php?lang=v8&lang2=yarv
<yoshokatana>	Sorella agreed, on all counts
*	Sorella wonders how much slower those benchmarks would run in Mermaid...
<Sorella>	But eh, it's not that bad either. Unless you're writing lots of CPU-crunching code in Ruby, in which case I'd ask WHY you're trying to do that
<nucleartide2>	crunch crunch
<inimino>	Speed always matters.

<inimino>	If there's some language benefit that outweighs the slowness then you can make the tradeoff, but if there isn't, then...
<Guest20>	i've tried to get rid of it with $ or \b \B
<Guest20>	but no one does it
<willv2>	Guest20 can you share a regexr link?
<Sorella>	inimino: oh, sure. I mean there are also other characteristics you might consider as more "interesting" for a particular problem
<noodcoder>	For CPU crunching programs I thinks it is better to use something like Go, I just rewrote a small crawler from python to Go and it is much faster
<Sorella>	noodcoder: Rust or C++ would be better choices tbqh
<inimino>	Sorella: In my opinion there's approximately nothing for which Ruby is the best choice, unless it's maintaining old Ruby stuff.
<Guest20>	willv2: https://regex101.com/r/vA6aN0/1
<Torqable>	how is a web crawler a "cpu crunching" program?

<Torqable>	actually

<inimino>	FernandoBasso: bubbling
<Sorella>	Torqable: tbqh it's only on my watch list because lesbians, ahaha. Though I'm not sure when I'll watch it (I've got Agent Carter and the new season of Orphan Black to catch up with)
<FernandoBasso>	Well, evt.target is passed as argument to a function. Let me see if I figure out a way.
<nbt>	FernandoBasso: is the event handler attached to the div? if so, skip the if(...) and just run 'dosth' in the event handler
<FernandoBasso>	nbt, It is attached to the whole document.
<FernandoBasso>	If I click somewhere, it closes div#delmsg. However, if div#delmsg has children, and I click on them, it also causes the the div to close, which I don't want.
*	lanceball is now known as lance|afk
*	Beautato_ is now known as Beautato
<nbt>	FernandoBasso: in that case, your code should be correct
<nbt>	when you click on a child of the div, the target is that child
<nbt>	so the if() should be false
<DDR>	(Unless it’s set to not process mouse events in CSS)
<FernandoBasso>	nbt, I'll try to make a simple fiddle.
<nbt>	FernandoBasso: ok
<FernandoBasso>	It is basically this: https://jsfiddle.net/99nnzckr/1/
<FernandoBasso>	There is a handler for "cancel" (that I defined somewhere else). But if I click on the paragraph "Are you sure?" I don't want the div to close.
<anna`>	So construct your popup differently
<anna`>	FernandoBasso: look at how your popup is constructed
<nbt>	FernandoBasso: I think your logic is wrong in the event handler
<nbt>	when you click on the text, the target is the <p> which has no id

<xqo>	ljharb the real value wont be a string, it will be an array
<FernandoBasso>	anna`, I have used that approach in other situations. The problem started when I had several elements inside that outter div. But it seems fine for this particular situation, though.

<ljharb>	xqo: otherwise nobody will have any idea what's going on in the code.
<xqo>	ljharb is there a way to do what i want, though?
<ljharb>	xqo: to coerce to a string, yes. to avoid having to reference a property, no.
<ljharb>	xqo: but what you really want is to subclass Array
<ljharb>	xqo: and you can't do that until ES6, and no browsers support it yet.
<ljharb>	xqo: and that part of ES6 can't be transpiled
<xqo>	ljharb you can subclass Array, actually
<ljharb>	xqo: just reference ".buffer". it's simple and easy

<NitroLiq>	Can someone help me out with how I can get .wrap() working on some clones? http://jsbin.com/xoxoqiteme/1/
<DDR>	But instead, one command. The comma discards the return value of the left side and, instead, returns the value from executing the right side.
<NitroLiq>	I thought in the return function I could say something like nodes[3].wrap(nodes[4])
<DDR>	The comma operator has the lowest precedence.
<Torqable>	seems like a silly way to use it
<ljharb>	yes, the comma operator is almost always silly when used.
<DDR>	I find some value in trying to indicate ‘these two commands are really closely related’, but I do admit for the most part there’s no valid reason to.

<NoiseEee>	"The major Browsers now implement strict mode. However, don't blindly depend on it since there is still a considerable amount of Browser versions used in the wild which has only partial support for strict mode or does not support it at all (e.g. Internet Explorer below version 10!). Strict mode changes semantics. Relying on those changes will cause mistakes and errors in browsers which don't implement strict mode."

<xqo>	when doing a for loop for (var i=0;i<x.length; i++); is it better to declare var i; before the for, or inside the () ?
<Feel>	Hi guys, what do you think about angularjs's perspectives?
<mbrzuzy>	xqo i'd say inside the for() so that it doesn't exist outside of the loop
<xqo>	there is no difference for performance?
<mbrzuzy>	I don't have a definitive answer for that, sorry dude
<GreenJello>	mbrzuzy, `var` is function scoped, so it does exist outside the loop
<serses>	is there anything faster than this ? http://jsbin.com/qewibodara/1/edit?js,console
<DDR>	mbrzuzy: It still exists outside the loop.
<comingsoontm_>	xqo:  but what would make a difference in performance is declaring the length outside, so you for loop don´t have to calculate x´s length each time
<DDR>	xqo: It makes absolutely no difference where i is declared; it’ll be hoisted to the top of the scope.
<Feel>	Don't use global vars
<GreenJello>	xqo, it's 100% style differences, most people say inside the loop or to avoid loops all together; putting it outside was popularized by jslint
<mbrzuzy>	you're right GreenJello, my mistake

<DDR>	(very strong generalization on my behalf, there)
<WajidKagzi>	is there an easy way to do ranges in JS?
<DDR>	[].slice
<Torqable>	of course, unless you're working on a large array and actually having performance concerns you're just wasting you time messing with it
<WajidKagzi>	elaborate?
<WajidKagzi>	for like a range of 80 to 89
<DDR>	To select a range from x = [1,2,3,4], you can use x.slice(0, 2) to get [1,2].
<DDR>	Oh, you mean generating! Sorry, I’m barking up the wrong tree.
<DDR>	I usually use _.range() for that, from the underscore family of libraries.
<DDR>	(eg, _.range(80,90) would give you the range you’re looking for.)
<WajidKagzi>	hmmm that makes sense

<Torqable>	and underscore is better in that regard... how?
<oddskill>	anybody ? im really lost
<Torqable>	if you're actually worried about file size you should use the modular imports
<DDR>	Eh, can’t find the small version. Must be just imagining it.
<Torqable>	if you're importing all of underscore because its a little smaller than all of lodash you're just goofy
<DDR>	I don’t see the big draw of lodash.

<cjohnson>	random
<cjohnson>	sorry
<Sorella>	Hannibal_Smith: doesn't look bad eh
<cjohnson>	IE11 already isn't bad
<Hannibal_Smith>	Sorella, one thing that leame me with some doubts is https://twitter.com/h0x0d/status/593498326114308099
<Sorella>	That sounds quite awful D:
<Hannibal_Smith>	Yes, really strange choice
<Hannibal_Smith>	We finally got rid of things like webit-, ms- and so on
<Hannibal_Smith>	And now MS is  proposing that one can simply check if the "browser" is "Windows", you can use "proprietary api"
<Ellis>	i’m getting a syntax error for this: var drink_index = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 0);

<Torkable>	is there a way to view bans on one's self
<Ellis>	ah i see
<Torkable>	it appears Im banned from ##mongoose
<Torkable>	not sure that I've even been to ##mongoose
<bprompt>	hehe
<Torkable>	much less done anything to be banned for
<Torkable>	idk
<bprompt>	Torkable:     it must be your "snaky ways", dunno
<Torkable>	wat?
<Ellis>	i’m trying to get this to return a random number between 0 & 3, but it is only returning 0, what’s wrong with it? var drink_index = (Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 0);
<bprompt>	hehe, lousy humor, moongoose eat snakes, so... they may not like them as much around, only as meal I guess
<DDR>	Ellis: Works fine here.
<bprompt>	Torkable:   they probably did a wide-ban on some hostmask, and yours is likely included in it, so. nothing personal likely, so much as a wide-ban on someone else who may be using the same hostmask as yours
<Sorella>	Torkable: some ops tend to be in several channels, and they preemptively ban people they feel wouldn't be a good fit on that community. People are often banned in #Node.js from their behaviour in this channel despite the fact that they haven't been to #Node.js yet, for example
<DDR>	Did you take a statistically significant sample? :p
<DDR>	Also you’ll only go to 2, because for math.floor to return 3, you’d have to pull a natural 1 out of Math.random().
<Ellis>	ddr: it doesn’t seem to change
<DDR>	The problem is not in that line of code.
<Torkable>	well that's just silly
<Torkable>	I have mongoose questions
<DDR>	You can put it in the debug console if you’re curious.
<DDR>	Well, less the var.
<comingsoontm>	yep it works fine
<bprompt>	Torkable:   bear in mind that ops are just mortals, and many of them not the sharpest tool in the shed, so their "wisdom" is questionable, then again, quite often is not a requirement to be a channel op anyway, so,  you could, /msg an op in that channel, the ban is only good to stop entrance, but you can /msg any of them, and put your case forth, so they can revise the ban a bit
<Torkable>	I don't know any mongoose ops
<bprompt>	Torkable:    I think    a /who #channelname    gives some  relevant info
<Torkable>	weird
<Torkable>	 /who gives me nothing
<Torkable>	o well
<Torkable>	wander what other channels I'm banned from lol
<Torkable>	wonder
<bprompt>	hehe
<Sorella>	Torkable: `/mode #channel +b` to see the banlist, `/msg chanserv access #channel list` to see privileged users
<nucleartide2>	Torkable your name is like a haskell typeclass
<Torkable>	wat
<bprompt>	hehe
<Torkable>	I'm not authorized to msg chanserv for that list lol
<bprompt>	har har
<Torkable>	they really dn't want me in there
<Torkable>	thats ok
<Torkable>	there's 422 issues open
<bprompt>	Torkable:     from   http://irc.netsplit.de/channels/?net=freenode   I see a #mongoosejs channel
<Torkable>	ill peruse those
<Torkable>	bprompt: there's like 4 people in it
<comingsoontm>	Torkable:  what is your mongoose question
<Torkable>	I just upgraded to mongoose 4
<Torkable>	doc.save(callback) is breaking
<Torkable>	callback is not being called
<Torkable>	found an issue on google groups
<Torkable>	then realized its from 2012
<Torkable>	can't find anything else on it
<comingsoontm>	hmmm, i worked with mongoose 3.8 last summer it was fine if I recall right
<Torkable>	right, project in currenlty running 3.8
<Torkable>	upgrade to 4.x breaks the save callbacks
<comingsoontm>	if this issue is from 2012 I don't think it is 4.02 related
<Torkable>	right
<comingsoontm>	ah
<comingsoontm>	weird
<Torkable>	yar
<comingsoontm>	did you try to ran a sample code, you may never know you could have soemthing wrong in your code
<comingsoontm>	it happens to everyone
<Torkable>	no but its worth a try
<comingsoontm>	sometimes there is ghost bugs like I call them, i delete the line write it again and it works lol
<comingsoontm>	I believe its psychological, human brain sometimes sees what it want to see and autocomplete from memroy
<bprompt>	ghost bugs?
<bprompt>	heheeh
<Guddu>	I have the following function that gets called upon submit button press. I tried to code it so that i the fields are not populated then the error message be shown. But right now it is shoing the dialog but submitting the form anyway. http://dpaste.com/26ZMVQK
<comingsoontm>	:D
<DDR>	I assume cache issues somewhere. It makes me sound saner.
<cjohnson>	I asked in #jquery but got silence. Does anybody know if you can do $('[href^=http]') and have the attr selector be case insensitive? Without breaking it out into a .filter method
<bprompt>	I've seen that, I'd rather call them "non-printable characters in the line", so rewriting it, removes any extraneous characters, often times
<comingsoontm>	DDR: haha yeah
<vapeboy>	I need some help with js and am willing to pay for it. is there a channel I can request it?
<comingsoontm>	bprompt: yes ! my explaination was just why we don't catch them sometimes
<cjohnson>	I don't know of any IRC channels vapeboy but there are websites for that
<deltab>	cjohnson: you could give it your own filter function instead
<cjohnson>	why not just try it yourself and have the people here help?
<cjohnson>	"Without breaking it out into a .filter method" was the last part of that sentence deltab :P
<bprompt>	reminds me of the Douglas crockford lecture   "this line is wrong, do you see why?  yes, the space at the end of the string, is obvious once it's pointed out"
<comingsoontm>	:D
<deltab>	cjohnson: oh right, that was on the next line
<cjohnson>	no biggie, just slightly harder to refactor into .filter because the selector is dynamically generated
<cjohnson>	thanks anyway
<comingsoontm>	Guddu: im still looking in your code
<Guddu>	Thanks comingsoontm
<vapeboy>	cjohnson: well, getkudos.me is getting discontinued and I really love their widget. I've played around with it, and found a way (sorta) to keep it even after their service goes down
<deltab>	cjohnson: the jquery docs don't mention case sensitivity afaics, and the selector spec says "The case-sensitivity of attribute names in selectors depends on the document language."
<comingsoontm>	Guddu: so you get like the ' db_yser_obligatorio' but the form is still sent
<Guddu>	comingsoontm, Yes
<vapeboy>	cjohnson: it mainly makes use of this js here: https://www.vapeboy.com/getkudos/widget.js (i'm hosting it myself now)
<nickhs>	Hey there! I'm using Chai + Mocha and I'm seeing an issue where nothing after an assert(false); is run. This particularly sucks when needing to use mocha's done. Any ideas?
<vapeboy>	cjohnson: don't know what's the next step though
<Guddu>	comingsoontm, It could be that form is getting submitted non-ajax way. but why should that happen? Will it be easier if i send you the complete HTML source code?
<Guddu>	comingsoontm, http://dpaste.com/0S1HGCE
<comingsoontm>	Guddu: oh wait, when you said the form is sent anyway, you mean the ajax call is made, or tha page loads to send the form ?
*	oddskill is now known as oddskill_away
<Guddu>	comingsoontm, It submits the form. But I am not sure if it submitted using ajax or non-ajax. Is there a way to validate that? I put alert in my ajax call but it did not raise the alert. SO i guess it is doing plain submission
<comingsoontm>	Guddu: it's easy to see if the form is sent the normal way : the browser will load the new page and go to /GDD/db_config_update/
*	Tomas_ is now known as Guest29979
<Guddu>	comingsoontm, Yes. That's what is happening
*	oddskill_away is now known as oddskill
<Torkable>	oh there's a gitter
<Torkable>	pfft
<comingsoontm>	Guddu: ah okay I was looking into another problem lol, so in your .click() function add a event.preventDefault(); line
<Guddu>	comingsoontm, First line of that function should be preventDefault?
<comingsoontm>	yes
<comingsoontm>	befoer the this.disabled
<comingsoontm>	before*
<Guddu>	comingsoontm, It workeddddddddddd
<Guddu>	:)
<Guddu>	comingsoontm, Thank you so much. I was hoping that the return False will work but it did not.
<comingsoontm>	Guddu: :D
<ljharb>	Torkable: are you looking for #mongoosejs?
<Torkable>	ljharb: I checked there and there are 4 or 5 quiet people in there
<Torkable>	so I tried ##mongoose and was instantly banned
<Torkable>	so a ban had been waiting on me to join lol
<ljharb>	you didn't say anything in mongoosejs tho. that's the official room.
<Torkable>	<ackbar.jpg>
<bprompt>	hmm
<ljharb>	no idea what "##mongoose" is.
<bprompt>	I checked at http://irc.netsplit.de/channels/?net=freenode   for "mongoose" and the only channel that shows is #mongoosejs, there's no ##mongoose that I can see

<DragonPunch>	Torkable: It's okay Torkable *hugs*
<ljharb>	Ellis: yes
<ljharb>	Ellis: you need an argument list
<ljharb>	Ellis: also, line 2 is a no-op.
<ljharb>	Ellis: also where does "que" and "customer" come from
<Ellis>	ljharb: a function always requires an argument?
<Ellis>	what is a no-op?
<ljharb>	Ellis: no
<yansanmo>	function name() { /* body */ }
<ljharb>	Ellis: ok so a function signature always requires parentheses, even if there's no arguments
<ljharb>	Ellis: a no-op is "no-operation" meaning "it does nothing"
<falafel>	Ellis, check the Eloquent book for beginners
<Ellis>	oh
<ljharb>	!eloquent @ Ellis
<ecmabot>	Ellis: Eloquent JavaScript is a comprehensive introductory Web-based book with examples and a built-in interpreter. http://eloquentjavascript.net/
<Ellis>	que and customer exist outside of the function
<falafel>	what is line 2 supposed to do Ellis ?
<yansanmo>	if drinks[drink_index] is a getter, it could do something
<ljharb>	Ellis: it'd be better to make the function only work with its arguments.
<ljharb>	yansanmo: lol true. but getters are awful.
<Ellis>	it sets the drink property for customer object to one of the properties of the drinks object
<ljharb>	Ellis: then you want "=" not "=="
<Ellis>	oh!! snap
<Ellis>	haha
<ljharb>	Ellis: "==" and "===" are comparison operators. "=" is assignment.
<Ellis>	ty
<DragonPunch>	Yeah.
<ljharb>	Ellis: read eloquent :-)
<yansanmo>	eloquent is too big
<Ellis>	i will it takes time for that stuff to sink in
<Ellis>	i am*
<ljharb>	Ellis: ideally, functions should be self-contained - meaning, they shouldn't work with things that aren't arguments, they shouldn't mutate/modify their arguments, and they should return something. basically that it can be called multiple times with the same arguments, and you'll get the same return value every time.
<airdem>	what would be the best way to remove the first and last char of a string?

<_shaggy>	hey ne1 helkp !!
<_shaggy>	in jQuery how can i access all the cookies for an ajax response
<_shaggy>	i have a server hosted on some ip and i am now trying to build a javascript layer to access those api and inorder to manage session i need to manage cookies
*	blazedd is now known as Blazedd[AFK]
<jacaballero>	_shaggy try xhr.getResponseHeader("header")
<ljharb>	_shaggy: cookies can be set to "http only" which means JS can't touch them. session cookies are surely set that way.
<Ellis>	how can i test my funtions?
<Sorella>	Ellis: you can use any of the many testing frameworks available for JavaScript.
<Ellis>	OK
<yansanmo>	"which one is the better" ?
<Torkable>	jasmin
<Torkable>	jasmine
<ljharb>	meh, bdd. use tape.
<Sorella>	^ That's one of the reasons Mermaid will only support BDD :P
<Sorella>	(Okay, no, actual BDD is quite awful)
<Torkable>	what reason
<_shaggy>	from page at http://a i am sending an ajax request to  http://b and want to access the cookies of the response from http://b how is it possible
<_shaggy>	?
<Sorella>	Torkable: "meh, bdd"
<Torkable>	what how is that a reason lol
<Sorella>	Torkable: Mermaid is a language that wants to see JavaScripters crying tears of blood. For starters it modifies all of your built-in prototypes, including Object.prototype :D
<RonRichie>	hey there:) could somebody please help me work this out? I hope by looking at code you can tell what I'm trying to accomplish :D
<RonRichie>	http://jsbin.com/nawomabuvu/1/edit?js,console,output
<Torkable>	Sorella: ... I ... ok
<comingsoontm>	RonRichie:  you are trying to do the same thing as yesterday :D
<RonRichie>	comingsoontm aha, but this time you you... it got more advanced(kind of :D) now Im trying to use the push method to push an array of object into an array lol
<RonRichie>	you know*
<RonRichie>	comingsoontm practice perfects the skills ;)
<Sorella>	_shaggy: the response headers should contain a Set-Cookie thingie. But there are probably libraries that handle that for you already instead of having you keep track of all the state.
<comingsoontm>	RonRichie: yes practice, but if you want to push something in an array, just push it ?
<sonthonax>	What exactly is the difference between TDD and BDD?
<RonRichie>	comingsoontm lol, the whole point is that I want to practice the callbacks, and I want callback to be a push method of an array that pushes an object into an array, otherwise I know I can manually push things into an array :D
<sonthonax>	buzzwords?
<comingsoontm>	RonRichie: I may be brong, but I think this is not the real use of callback
<comingsoontm>	RonRichie: wrong*
<comingsoontm>	RonRichie: optimal use I mean
<RonRichie>	comingsoontm yeah sure you are right:) they are meant to be executed once the first part of the function is done, it's just I kind of  try to make other use of it by doing it this way
<RonRichie>	hence... as the name suggests itself :)
<comingsoontm>	RonRichie: yeah you got it, I just feared you are running in a loophole :P
<RonRichie>	comingsoontm :D
<ljharb>	RonRichie: you don't want to do that
<ljharb>	RonRichie: because you'll never be able to know when it's time to access the array
<ljharb>	RonRichie: it's async. you can only work with the values *inside the callback*.
<RonRichie>	comingsoontm trying ti improvise and all ;) but as a matter of fact, when thursday I went to the school interview, the interviewer actually got me to use callbacks in this fashion
<RonRichie>	ljharb let me try to consume what you've just said lol
<_shaggy>	Sorella Set-Cookie is not working
<comingsoontm>	RonRichie: a school interview or job interview ?
<cjohnson>	sonthonax: BDD is what you want to be doing
<cjohnson>	to quote the SO article "BDD is TDD done right. TDD done right is BDD"
<cjohnson>	it just means "test that the system works for the user instead of testing that the invidiaul brittle components work"
<DragonPunch>	\o
<RonRichie>	comingsoontm school, Hack Reactor, they've got me to write callbacks, closures, and in fact callbacks in this fashion as you saw in my example:)
<cjohnson>	it is completely useless to test that x y and z modules all work if when the user goes to use them collectively, they fail
<sonthonax>	cjohnson: isn’t testing how modules interact intergration testing?
<cjohnson>	yes that's another name for it
<_shaggy>	Sorella how to access the Set-Cookie header ?
<cjohnson>	but really it's all the same thing, just applied to different levels
*	lanceball is now known as lance|afk
<comingsoontm>	RonRichie: oh I see
<cjohnson>	but the only one that really matters is the most front-facing one
<ljharb>	BDD is gross.
<ljharb>	tape ftw.
<sonthonax>	I like to test though induction.
<Sorella>	cjohnson: particularly I want something like this: `function foo(a, b){ return a + b } satisfying { examples foo(2, 3) => 5; foo(0, 3) => 3; foo(3, 0) => 3; laws identity(n: Number) = foo(n, 0) === foo(0, n) === n }`
<RonRichie>	comingsoontm waiting for a response from them through the email, I'll jump off the windows if it reads that I've been accepted :)
<cjohnson>	Sorella: que?
<cjohnson>	lol
<Sorella>	Forces you to write your tests INSIDE the modules, right there under your functions. It also tells people how to use that function. And laws are neat.
<comingsoontm>	RonRichie: good luck :D
<cjohnson>	ooh ok Sorella
<RonRichie>	comingsoontm thanks :)
<_shaggy>	Sorella how to access the Set-Cookie header ?
<cjohnson>	that would be really cool
<cjohnson>	that's definitely one major issue with tests, going back to update them, or remembering to write them at all
<cjohnson>	sonthonax: I'm not sure what you mean by that but if you mean integration testing or something along those lines then that is good
<cjohnson>	if you prefer testing lower level modules, then that is utterly useless
<cjohnson>	because the end user doesn't care if the lower level modules work individually, if they don't work together
<sonthonax>	cjohnson: I was joking, testing by induction isn’t relevant to programing.
<RonRichie>	ljharb would you say in general it's a bad practice to utualize the `callbacks` in this fashion? http://jsbin.com/buvicoyana/1/edit thanks
<ljharb>	RonRichie: it's bad practice to ever use "alert". but no, that general style is fine.
<RonRichie>	ljharb ah, yeah `alert` in this case was just an example, the whole point was if using callbacks in a way of dynimically passing functions to them so they can do something with a given code was a good practice :)
<ljharb>	it can be
<ljharb>	it's not an automatic "do it this way", but it's a good tool.
<Sorella>	RonRichie: passing functions around is how you do programming in JS :)
<RonRichie>	Sorella aha, that's what I've just came to figure :D
<RonRichie>	I hoppeee they gonnnaaa accepttt meeee :(
<RonRichie>	hmm I don't get this, this works the way I expected it do but afterwards it says `callback is not a function` ? http://jsbin.com/buvicoyana/1/edit?html,js,output
<RonRichie>	am I missing something out?
<RonRichie>	ah, I fixed it by removing () from callbacks, but there is one more thing I don't understand
<RonRichie>	why does callback function execute first then the first argument? even though callback comes later in code?
<ezakimak>	passedFunc("haha") is invoking passedFunc() and passing the *return value* to anAttempt()
<ezakimak>	what you probably want is anAttempt("whatever", passedFunc.bind(null, "haha"))
<ezakimak>	also, your anAttempt code doesn't actually invoke callback without ()
<winny>	hello, is there a simpler way to do [1, 1, 1, 1].map(function(unused, idx) { return n >>> (idx*8); });   ?
<RonRichie>	opps sorry, my laptop went to sleep :-/
<ezakimak>	s/unused/null/
<ljharb>	winny: what is that actually attempting to do?
<ezakimak>	oh. nm.
<winny>	i Tried Array(4).map(....) but that does'nt work because Array.prototype.map() skipes entries that are undefined
<ljharb>	yes that's right but i mean in english
<ljharb>	like what are you trying to make an array of
<ezakimak>	Sorella knows this sort of magic.
<winny>	i need to unpack a 32-bit integer into bytes
<winny>	unsigned integer
<winny>	I have a working example here (see the second function) https://codepen.io/anon/pen/eNNJJV?editors=011
<ljharb>	winny: what for?
<winny>	just for fun
<Torkable>	synaptic demo busted lol
<Torkable>	http://synaptic.juancazala.com/#/
<Torkable>	at least for me
<ljharb>	lol
<ljharb>	winny: so you have no concrete use case for needing the bytes in an integer?
<Sorella>	winny: you need Array.apply(null, { length: 4 }).map(f) because arrays in JS are variadic
<ljharb>	also note that JS doesn't have integers, only doubles.
<Sorella>	Erm, s/variadic/sparse/
<RonRichie>	ezakimak I wonder how is your suggested way is different from what I was doing? it probabal passes the function and it gets executed right within anAttempt() function I guess?
<Sorella>	I need some serious sleep
<ezakimak>	my suggestion is radically different from what your code was doing
<winny>	ljharb: yes, though for this example js's unified numeric type is used correctly here
<winny>	Sorella: thank you, i'll check that out
<ezakimak>	you were invoking your intended callback *before* your anAttempt was invoked
<ezakimak>	and you weren't even passing the callback to your anAttempt function
<RonRichie>	:-/
<RonRichie>	let me try to reread what you said and look at my code see if I understand what's the matter with that, thanks for heads up though
<ezakimak>	your code was in essence: var tmp = passedFunc("haha"); anAttempt("whatever", tmp);
<RonRichie>	ezakimak the way you corrected it, is it the only way to make this happen the way it seems I want that to work out?
<winny>	Sorella: yes, that works like a charm, thanks again
<ezakimak>	i'm sure there are other solutions

<roger1>	Hi, i was wondering if there was any way around this problem i'm having. If I call: request.onsuccess = function(e) { this.test() }; I get an error as this function is executing outside of my class.
<roger1>	even though request.onsuccess is being called  from within my class.
<roger1>	it seems like the only work around is to use a global?
<ezakimak>	what "class" there are no classes in javascript
<ljharb>	^ 👍
<Sorella>	!this @ roger1
<ecmabot>	roger1: If a function call is of the form `a.b()`, `this` will be the object you accessed the "b" property from. Otherwise, if it's of the form `a()`, `this` will be `undefined`, which is turned into the global object if the function isn't in strict mode. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/08/30/understanding-javascripts-this/
<RonRichie>	no class but its classy though
<Sorella>	roger1: JS doesn't have classes, OR bound methods. Which means that `this` is always resolved by how you call the function
<RonRichie>	that's more important lol
<ezakimak>	classy like a tuxedo
<_pr0t0type_>	hey guys, is there a way to ask for permissions explicitly using the google chrome api (javascript) on a simple web app?
<_pr0t0type_>	not a chrome extension or app, just a simple web  app

<Sorella>	roger1: well, you can create bound methods with `foo.function.bind(foo)`

<adv_>	 i mean rgba
<roger1>	Sorella:  the alert on line 18 is "undefined" even though it's set on line 12;  The only work around i have is to make db a global.
<winny>	Sorella: in your example Array.apply(null, { length: 4 }).map(...), how does that work, because according to mdn the second arg of Function.prototype.apply() is supposed to be an array
*	carlsimpson is now known as randomprogrammer
<ezakimak>	in your DB.prototype.open body add: var self = this; and in the onsuccess function change this to self
<ezakimak>	that way when you call a.open() self will close over and capture this (a), which onsuccess can then reference
<roger1>	ezakimak:  sweet! That worked. I guess 'this' is in a new scope?
<ezakimak>	no globals required.
<roger1>	is that why it doesn't work with this directly?
<ezakimak>	did you read the ecmabot output?
<ezakimak>	this is always defined by the calling context, not the lexical context
<roger1>	ah okay.
<roger1>	ezakimak:  thanks so much :) that did the trick.
<ezakimak>	<becomes this in afunction>.afunction()
<ezakimak>	if you were to invoke open directly from the prototype it wouldn't work
<adv_>	currentColor.replace(')', ', 0.2)').replace('rgb', 'rgba');
<adv_>	hm why does this fail?
<ezakimak>	because then this would be the prototype object, not the DB instance
<adv_>	anyone?
<ezakimak>	is it a string?
<ezakimak>	>> "rgb(14, 197, 24)".replace(')', ', 0.2)').replace('rgb', 'rgba')
<ecmabot>	ezakimak: (string) 'rgba(14, 197, 24, 0.2)'
<ezakimak>	looks like it works just fine.
<tinylobsta>	i'm getting garbage data appended to the end of a file when i use fs.writeFile in node

<ljharb>	tinylobsta: ask in #node.js
<ljharb>	and you probably have a race condition.

<GreenJello>	roger1, nope
<GreenJello>	embrace the async
<roger1>	My other question is: is there another way I can pass this callback function on line 20 that's anymore readable? I need to pass the callback wrapped in another function so it' isn't evaluated before open() is done.
<Guest69344>	put it on the next line?
<Guest69344>	so its not weird
<roger1>	yea sorry i can improve the spacing.
*	comingsoontm_ is now known as comingsoontm
<deltab>	roger1: you could convert the code to use promises
<GreenJello>	roger1, that's about as good as it gets
<GreenJello>	promises help with things that are really ugly to do with plain callbacks, like doing 5 things in parallel and processing the results when everything is done
<ezakimak>	you could also simply name your callback function

<knod>	Ok, that's what I thought, but I was thrown off by the whole 'name' thing
<ezakimak>	think about radios
<ezakimak>	they must share the same name, but labels must match to a specific one

<knod>	Yeah

<deltab>	Guddu_: it might be. It depends on what you plan to do with it.
<Guddu_>	yansanmo, deltab I will later use this to build a dropdown of States and Cities

<DragonPunch>	how do you add eventlisteners to dynamically addded objects
<Havvy>	DragonPunch:  Get a reference to the DOM node and then do .addEventListener("event", function () {}, false) to it.
<DragonPunch>	i am
<DragonPunch>	$(".group-chatbox[data-groupboxid="+groupid+"]").addEventListener("drop", FileSelectHandlerGroupChatBox, false);
<knod>	DragonPunch: are you getting reference to it before or after you dynamically add it?
<Havvy>	jQuery uses `.on()` instead of `.addEventListener()`
<DragonPunch>	i am going to use a javascript document get class name
<Havvy>	Also drops the third useless parameter.
<DragonPunch>	ugh crap so fucking annoying
<Havvy>	1) Language....
<knod>	DragonPunch: just so you know, getting by class gives you a list of nodes
<knod>	DragonPunch: Another way is to put an event listener on a parent and then check if the target is what you want
<knod>	You could even put it on document, I think
<Havvy>	2) When using a library, figure out what your types are, and what methods are. Abstraction layers don't always use the same terminology.
<DragonPunch>	knod: wow thanks, i know that. but thanks for making me realize it. nvm. im going to use jQuery then.
<DragonPunch>	that was too close.
<knod>	I think jquery will give you a list too
<DragonPunch>	$(".group-chatbox[data-groupboxid="+groupid+"]")
<DragonPunch>	would give me one
<knod>	because classes can have multiple items while id's only have one
<knod>	DragonPunch: It might give you a list with just one item
<DragonPunch>	i see.
<DragonPunch>	um..
<knod>	Which would be the same in js or in jquery
<DragonPunch>	ill work around that
<DragonPunch>	then
<knod>	You can put [0] at the end, but that's a little fragile
<knod>	If there's only ever going to be one, give it an id?
<DragonPunch>	it is.
<ljharb>	or who cares
<ljharb>	if it's only going to be one, then you'd only get a list of 1, right
<adv_>	how can i remove the first class of a #foo selector? i don't know its name
<ljharb>	adv_: "first" isn't necessarily meaningful.
<adv_>	ljharb: why ?
<ljharb>	adv_: css class ordering only matters if they conflict with each other. and you don't know if a class has been removed and re-added.
<knod>	If there's only going to be one, id would be a more clear way of writing the code
<ljharb>	knod: not in jquery, it's just # instead of .
<ljharb>	adv_: what are you trying to achieve?
<adv_>	ljharb: ok so i know only one changes
<knod>	Yeah, but that tells you something more
<ljharb>	adv_: you may want to use data attributes and not css classes
<knod>	At least I find it clearer. I can only really speak for myself
<adv_>	ljharb: class="yellow btn btn-xs" . but yellow can be black,blue,red etc
<ljharb>	adv_: then remove all the color css classes.
<ljharb>	adv_: like, unconditionally strip all of them
<adv_>	ljharb: i don't know which one is on at any given time
<ljharb>	adv_: right
<ljharb>	adv_: so, "remove black" will just be a no-op if there's no black
<knod>	Hmm. You could make the class something like 'color-yellow' and then regex remove stuff that starts with color
<ljharb>	"remove all" just means "make sure there's no colors afterwards"
<ljharb>	assuming you don't care what color it has, as long as it has no color after.
<adv_>	so removeClass("yellow black allcolorshere") ?
<ljharb>	yes
<knod>	Will that remove each of them, or only something that has all of them?
<ljharb>	each
<knod>	Oh, cool!

<lsalsa>	hi guys.
<lsalsa>	have a bit of a problem
<lsalsa>	https://jsfiddle.net/7qdmxcjw/1/
<lsalsa>	trying to dynamically load images into an index.html page using js.
<lsalsa>	is there something i'm doing wrong here that someone can see?
*	csdc is now known as adv_
<lsalsa>	or say i have 100 images all named 1.jpg to 100.jpg, can i just var images = [1 to 100]  and then Math.random() it?
<kicken>	for one thing you're not using jsfiddle right.  HTML goes in the top left, not in the script pane.
<lsalsa>	kicken: sorry, it's really just a very simple example, i wanted to use codepad
<lsalsa>	 I just thought given that I have a directory with images all numbered 1.jpg to 100.jpg I could simply do a Math.floor((Math.random() * 100) + 1);
<lsalsa>	But I don't know how to select all those images without manually having some sort of arrya
<robbieSti>	is the <modal html tag standard html?
<kicken>	lsalsa, your code is hardly readable the way it is.  Your PHP code isn't going to produce a json array like you seem to be assuming, so that's wrong.
<lsalsa>	kicken: :(
<lsalsa>	robbieSti: sorry one sec, didn't think i put a modal tag
<Havvy>	robbieSti:  Nope.
<lsalsa>	I know noobs who don't read the ECMAScript standards are the most irritating thing you lot have to suffer through.
<lsalsa>	I just wanted to dynamically hcange the stuff on my page heh.
<Havvy>	Most people don't read the ECMAScript standards. They're not really readable.
<lsalsa>	oh well
<lsalsa>	i don't know how to solve this. what shall i do?
<lsalsa>	i came up with a solution i think is utterly broken.
<lsalsa>	http://codepad.org/mrn43szo
<kicken>	lsalsa, json_encode(scandir('images')); for your PHP code would get your json string for the array of images.
<kicken>	then you just pick a random number from 0 to images.length-1
<lsalsa>	it's 1-100.
<deltab>	if you know that all the images 1.jpg to 100.jpg exist, you don't need an array
<Dexx1_>	How do I access a VIEW variable from a MODEL in Backbone.js ?
<Dexx1_>	Errr. I meant. a VIEW variable from a Collection?
<deltab>	lsalsa: but if you don't, or you want the more general way, then get an index into the array, which will be from 0 to the length minus one
<lsalsa>	deltab: i know! i just don't knwo how to do it it, i don't know js well at all, and i want to do this and just learn it from the nice book i bought
<deltab>	".jpg"')' is invalid
<lsalsa>	deltab: https://jsfiddle.net/7qdmxcjw/2/
<lsalsa>	yeah, i realised that it was an idiotic imstake
<deltab>	extension')' likewise
<lsalsa>	oh
<lsalsa>	god, i'm useless at this.
<lsalsa>	it's just for a personal home-page.
<deltab>	lsalsa: extension + ')'
<lsalsa>	ok will try that.
<deltab>	use your browser's web inspector to check the result: currently  background-image: url("24.jpg");
<lsalsa>	deltab: i'm trying a different technique
<deltab>	lsalsa: you're not useless; your code is very close to working
<lsalsa>	the images are earthview, it's like erm
<lsalsa>	images of the earth. heh.
<lsalsa>	here is what i thought of doing: https://jsfiddle.net/7qdmxcjw/3/
<lsalsa>	each image is listed from 1-100.jpg
<lsalsa>	that's why i used the Math.floor
<lsalsa>	in that particular way.
<lsalsa>	now the backgroundImage bit is where I think I fudged up.
<lsalsa>	And I fixed the location of the js/css/html bit on jsfiddle btw for those who hated the way i approached it.
<deltab>	the random number part is fine
<deltab>	the problem is with  'url(' + images + randomNumber
<deltab>	lsalsa: are you seeing an error message?
<lsalsa>	deltab: only making these modifications on jsfiddle, i haven't put it on the main site yet, as the main site is static for now. i can msg you the main site?
<deltab>	jsfiddle is fine for this
<lsalsa>	deltab: what's wrong with the url section of this https://jsfiddle.net/7qdmxcjw/5/
<lsalsa>	okay
<lsalsa>	 cool
<deltab>	I'm guessing you don't know how to use browser dev tools to help debug
<lsalsa>	deltab: i am as new to this as a fish is to land.
<deltab>	okay
<lsalsa>	i know a bit of c, but it's a completely different affair.
<lsalsa>	entirely terminal based.
*	deltab nods
<lsalsa>	never used a lexer or valgrind or etc.
<deltab>	do you know how to open dev tools?
<lsalsa>	yeah, one sec i know how on chrome.
<deltab>	okay, do that on the jsfiddle page
<roger1>	Hi, i was wondering if there was a way that I could change lines 20-25 to use a promise instead? http://codepad.org/fntHBX4D
<deltab>	lsalsa: and look in the Console pane
<lsalsa>	deltab: the javascript console in chrome?
<lsalsa>	ok
<roger1>	or can promises only be used in creating a function not calling functions with callbacks?
<roger1>	i.e: would I need to create a new function to use a promise here.
<deltab>	lsalsa: it's one of the tabs in the web inspector panel
<deltab>	lsalsa: this: https://developer.chrome.com/devtools#console
<GreenJello>	roger1, you need a function that returns a promies, yes
<GreenJello>	lsalsa, jsfiddle runs your code on the load event, so you first need to remove your wrapper https://jsfiddle.net/7qdmxcjw/6/
<GreenJello>	and then your code will run, and you can see the error in the console
<deltab>	actually there's something even more important, and it's already being reported
<deltab>	lsalsa: looking at the console yet?
<lsalsa>	sigh.
<lsalsa>	deltab: yeah, trying to figure it out atm.
<deltab>	you may need to reload the page
<lsalsa>	ReferenceError: extension is not defined
<lsalsa>	and the url bit is red.
<lsalsa>	well, it's more of a caarmine than a red.
<lsalsa>	or a burgundy. not that this matters.
<deltab>	"the url bit" in line 3?
<lsalsa>	this is the problem: document.body.style.backgroundImage = 'url(' + "https://earthview.withgoogle.com/images/wallpaper/" + randomNumber + extension + ')';
<lsalsa>	yes
<lsalsa>	speficically that.
<lsalsa>	i wonder what I've done wrong.
<GreenJello>	lsalsa, this part is the same as C, you can't use a variable that doesn't exist
<lsalsa>	ah
<lsalsa>	so var blah = document.body.style … ?
<deltab>	>> extension
<ecmabot>	deltab: ReferenceError: extension is not defined
<GreenJello>	>> var extension = '.jpg'; extension
<ecmabot>	GreenJello: (string) '.jpg'
<deltab>	lsalsa: in earlier versions of the code, you'd defined it
<lsalsa>	whoops
<lsalsa>	god, i'm a moron.
<lsalsa>	sec.
<deltab>	deleting unnecessary code can be useful for narrowing in on faulty code
<deltab>	in this case however you've removed some code that is necessary :-)
<lsalsa>	now i get this. https://jsfiddle.net/7qdmxcjw/12/
<lsalsa>	lol, this is my first attempt at js.
<lsalsa>	i'm reading a book i bought on amazon, but i haven't gotten very far, and wanted to make a personal site.
<deltab>	do you see an error message in the console?
<lsalsa>	then extend my way through like this guy i know.
<falafel>	Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input
<lsalsa>	deltab: yes, it says unexpected end of input index:1
<deltab>	right, and in firefox it says  SyntaxError: missing } after function body
<falafel>	lsalsa, click that button up to "TidyUp", it becomes clear where the error is
<lsalsa>	hmm
<lsalsa>	falafel: https://jsfiddle.net/7qdmxcjw/13/ same error.
<falafel>	lsalsa, and in "extension", the previous line should have a coma, not a semicolon
<DragonPunch>	lol king dedede so over powered in smash atm
<falafel>	otherwise you make an implicit global
<falafel>	lsalsa, right, you didn't fix it, track your open and closing braces
<deltab>	lsalsa: try the JSHint button
<lsalsa>	falafel: https://jsfiddle.net/7qdmxcjw/15/
<lsalsa>	falafel: deltab no errors here, but no images show up either https://jsfiddle.net/7qdmxcjw/16/
<deltab>	okay, so let's put something in the code that will show up
<falafel>	lsalsa, the url doesn't display an image, it probably has a Content-Type that you didn't expect
<falafel>	it does download it
<deltab>	add a line that says  console.log("hello!");
<lsalsa>	sorry i'm disturbing you lot, i know you have your own lives of AngularJS and startups to work on.
<lsalsa>	OH SHIT IT WORKS.
<lsalsa>	OH SHIT OH SHIT OH SHIT
<lsalsa>	OH SHIT
<lsalsa>	AND YOU MADE ME HELP MYSELF INSTEAD OF DOING IT FOR ME
<lsalsa>	i'm so pleased, like this is the first thing i've been able to code since 2005 when i made a program that was a reverse polish notation poiece of shit to learn C with
<lsalsa>	LOL, WOW.
<lsalsa>	i'm happy :)
<lsalsa>	just need to fix up my css a bit, and i have my own business card online for my skill-less attempts at being a programmer.
<lsalsa>	don't want to be a developer
<lsalsa>	those people who kludge code together and call themselves coders
<lsalsa>	i dont want to be a dilletantte
<falafel>	lsalsa, jsfiddle does the onload for you, that's probably why it doesn't work I guess
<lsalsa>	i want to do well here.
<lsalsa>	falafel: yeaah!
<lsalsa>	i reloaded it on my vps
<lsalsa>	which i need to pay for, months due, hope amazon doesn't kick me off
<falafel>	lsalsa, https://jsfiddle.net/7qdmxcjw/19/
<deltab>	you can just delete the first and last lines (jsfiddle will add its own automatically)
<lsalsa>	falafel: huh weird.
<lsalsa>	deltab: oh
<deltab>	see the second drop-down on the left
*	robotmayo is now known as zz_robotmayo
<lsalsa>	onLoad, onDomReady?
<lsalsa>	yeah i do.
<deltab>	yeah
<lsalsa>	cool, this is useful
<deltab>	jsfiddle wraps your code in the appropriate wrapper for what you choose there
<lsalsa>	now i just need to read this book so i can actually be useful around this site.
<deltab>	you can also add various common libraries there too
<lsalsa>	like jquery and angular?
<deltab>	yes
<lsalsa>	god i don't know how much time it would take me to become good at this
<Agamemnus>	We should add a bot that moderates text
<Agamemnus>	All text goes through the bot
<lsalsa>	Agamemnus: did i say something wrong?
<deltab>	Agamemnus: what?
<Agamemnus>	any time someone says Angular, it would go ****
<Agamemnus>	D:
<Le22S>	what's wrong with angular?
<Sorella>	It's better to just s/Angular/React/
<Sorella>	Le22S: what isn't?
<Agamemnus>	What's wrong with Angular?
<Le22S>	i'm using react for a rather large application right now, loving it
<Agamemnus>	*face gets red*.. *blows up*
*	len is now known as Guest33332
<Le22S>	react + reflux
<Le22S>	quite nice
<Agamemnus>	I guess the biggest problem, for me, is people coming in here and asking for Angular help.. and the thing they want to do can be done in 3 lines of JS code with some libs
<Sorella>	Le22S: but eh, opinionated framework with a way-too-complicated architecture, and too many Java-isms that don't quite fit JS as a language. Hard to reason about / optimise / etc.
<Agamemnus>	but they're doing some sort of weird HTML mess instead
<Le22S>	that's fair, i do agree
<lsalsa>	i don't know much about this ecosystem
<Agamemnus>	(I mean, strings, and such)
<lsalsa>	i started c when i was 15
<lsalsa>	i read k&r
<lsalsa>	in a library in nigeria
<comingsoontm>	hmmm they bashing angularjs
<lsalsa>	i didn't have my own computer
<lsalsa>	then i saw peopel do aweseom stuff in js
<lsalsa>	ten years later
<lsalsa>	and i'm like, i need to be able to do this.
<lsalsa>	just trying to fix up the css now
<Agamemnus>	Interesting
<lsalsa>	want to make two borders, but one is proving diffficult
<comingsoontm>	Agamemnus: what about angularjs 2 ?
<lsalsa>	sorry for spamming you Agamemnus
<comingsoontm>	Agamemnus: im not an evangelist or anything dont hit me, im just asking to know
<lsalsa>	i honestly feel that frameworks like angular and rails and whatever are problematic
<lsalsa>	in the sense that
<lsalsa>	people do learn the language anymore
<lsalsa>	they learn the fremwork
<lsalsa>	it's like learning how to piss standing up before owning a penis.
<Agamemnus>	comingsoontm: No idea. When people stop coming in here with weird questions about doing Angular things that are extremely simple with basic JS, I won't have such a big issue
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa:  you could say the same thing for english and it's expressions, just teach people to always get back to basics
<Maxdamantus>	its*
<lsalsa>	comingsoontm: i want to be better with english too, i'm reading tons and tons.
<Agamemnus>	The second problem I have with Angular is that it cheapens developers, literally
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa: omg no, I didnt mean you, I was comparing enlighs language to programing language... Im sorry...
<Agamemnus>	It's kind of like Frontpage on steroids, imo.
<lsalsa>	comingsoontm: oh lol.
<lsalsa>	comingsoontm: could show you my ibooks screenie if you want :p
<Le22S>	isalsa: that's why i like "frameworks" like symfony + composer or nodejs + npm. they provide more of a foundation for your own solution or framework
<Agamemnus>	That's great if you want a site made. Not so great for developers.
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa: :D
<lsalsa>	comingsoontm: want it? unless Agamemnus would bully me for it.
<Agamemnus>	Speaking of nodejs
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa: english book ?
<lsalsa>	comingsoontm: ya, well not books on english
<lsalsa>	hang on i think i have my mini bookshelf on imgur
<Kosre>	Agamemnus, how is Angular (a javascript framework) remotely close to Frontpage, an IDE for building static web pages?
<lsalsa>	real books
<lsalsa>	deadtree
<Agamemnus>	Kosre: like I said. STEROIDS
<Le22S>	Kosre++
<Agamemnus>	Here's another problem with frameworks or libraries. The more abstract it is, the harder it is to debug anything.
<comingsoontm>	Agamemnus: but that happens for other reasons, jquery or angular attract people easier because you can see them as an entity, they have like a brand, 'im using jquery to do this cool stuff', but with plain javascript its harder for everyone, its like a video of a guy creating a frameowrk with javascript, wont attract much people...
<Agamemnus>	Ok, sure
<Agamemnus>	Now, let me rant:
<comingsoontm>	lol
<Agamemnus>	Every time I go into a framework/library, I have to go down the rabbit hole.
<Agamemnus>	EVERY TIME
<Le22S>	Agamemnus: with a good debugger, nope. also the more abstract means the easier to write tests ... usually
<deltab>	Kosre: in the effect on its users, I guess; encouraging people to do things its own way instead of learning the basics
<Agamemnus>	pixi.js last year? Memory leaks EVERYWHERE. God help me if I was using Phaser.
<ezakimak>	debugging other people's code *sucks*
<Agamemnus>	node.io and expressjs. WOW, that's so intuitive!
<Agamemnus>	That's not sarcasm, but:
<Agamemnus>	sorry,
<comingsoontm>	Agamemnus: lol I was planing on using Phaser thanks for destorying its image x)
<Agamemnus>	socket.io
<Agamemnus>	It has gotten better, though. Thanks to ME
<Agamemnus>	There wasn't deallocation sometimes
<lsalsa>	comingsoontm: http://i.imgur.com/BXqrs78.jpg
<lsalsa>	stuff i have at home
<lsalsa>	getting more, ordered like half a dozen on amazon.
<lsalsa>	you really need to read the essays of montaigne
<lsalsa>	i think it would change your life
<Agamemnus>	Ok ok, so I was using socket.io. And it's really intuitive.
<comingsoontm>	lol
<Agamemnus>	But, they were using a chat example with AN OLD VERSION of express
<Agamemnus>	So what am I supposed to do, RABBIT HOLE TIME!
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa: oh nice, *looking around* I don't have books I dont read books :3
<Le22S>	Agamemnus: do you write in notepad?
<Kosre>	deltab: Agreed!
<Agamemnus>	I have yet to get back to that by the way. If anyone wants to rewrite that example....
<Agamemnus>	Notepad++
<Agamemnus>	Used to code in Notepad, though.
<comingsoontm>	rabbit hole time lol
*	Le22S sighs
<lsalsa>	comingsoontm: i'll upload my ibooks, or some of them for you so you can just see.
<Agamemnus>	+)
<lsalsa>	some are tefchnical, so you might like them
<deltab>	lsalsa: ooh, About Face, great book
<lsalsa>	http://imgur.com/NNiYNP3,PBEjoyZ,tRCNCHs,8rrzyxQ,A6ReOg3
<lsalsa>	deltab: yeah, i made sure i boughtthat one.
<lsalsa>	deltab: but i'm shit at design
<Agamemnus>	And then when I wanted to change some of the code, they had me rewrite their own code in horrible Java style
<Agamemnus>	if (x)
<Agamemnus>	{
<Agamemnus>	dostuff()
<Agamemnus>	}
<Agamemnus>	KILLS ME
<lsalsa>	imgur is weird, the first second and third images are linked in an unusual way on the top.
<lsalsa>	sorry
<Seikho_>	lsalsa: naked statistics, what's the go there?
<Agamemnus>	I mean, look, it's free and it's made by basically a handful of people. So you can't complain too much.
<Seikho_>	what branch of stats are they talking about
<Agamemnus>	But it's always an issue with libraries
<Agamemnus>	..and frameworks
<DragonPunch>	wtb hennsey.
<lsalsa>	Seikho_: nothing to do with sex ;p
<Seikho_>	lsalsa: :/
<lsalsa>	Seikho_: more of an economic book, statistical analysis
<lsalsa>	it was forked off of naked economics
<Agamemnus>	And the other issue is that these very popular things now are making developers seem interchangeable. They aren't, so it's not a good development.
<lsalsa>	Seikho_: :/
<Seikho_>	ah. nothing behavioural?
<comingsoontm>	Agamemnus: but I don't understand you... its like telling me life is unfair because you have to work to get money, I mean, this is how it is what do you want ? libraries giving free candy ?
<lsalsa>	Seikho_: well it does seem like behavioral economics, but not per-se.
<lsalsa>	statistical analysis and management i'd say.
<Agamemnus>	Libraries do not give candy. That would ruin the books/keyboards.
<comingsoontm>	lol
<lsalsa>	it's very good though, you should get it.
<lsalsa>	and if anyone wants icons, i bought like 900MB worth, so i can share.
<lsalsa>	you guys have been so nice
<Agamemnus>	Icons
<Seikho_>	i'm only really interested in biostatistics.
<Agamemnus>	From thenounproject?
<lsalsa>	Seikho_: ah, i dunno about anything about that
<Agamemnus>	Have you seen that?
<lsalsa>	Agamemnus: no, from ui8
<lsalsa>	cost me 300+
<lsalsa>	wanted to become a "designer"
<lsalsa>	designed an app actually, or a mini app.
<Seikho_>	basically, psychology.
<Agamemnus>	When I was young (elementary school) I used to do that all the time. I competed with a classmate. We used to draw pages of icons.
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa: please what is that imac icon on the top bar ? and the one at its right ?
<Agamemnus>	this was when Windows was 3.1, so it wasn't icons per se
<lsalsa>	comingsoontm: cleanmymac
<lsalsa>	comingsoontm: very useful, you should get it.
<Agamemnus>	anyway. Icons are always good. Thenounproject is also a good source, if you ever wanted more than 900MB of icons
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa: ah okay makes sense xD its a screen swiper
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa: I have windows MOUHAHAHAHA
<lsalsa>	comingsoontm: hehehe
<lsalsa>	comingsoontm: well there's a new GOLD macbook
<lsalsa>	Agamemnus: yeah, i saw it, i'm like 30 seconds into this.
<Le22S>	typically if i have an issue with a library, i fork it and fix it. takes far less time to do that than to write the whole thing from scratch, anyway. not to mention, write the rest of the *working* libraries from scratch that you're also using because you don't believe in libraries
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa: not my sip of coffee ( what was it again ? )
<lsalsa>	this website is sort of the first i've done, with heavy help and copypasta.
<Agamemnus>	copypasta is how I coded my first 10 years.
<lsalsa>	comingsoontm: price? $1300, but apple does this thing where they offer reductions on stuff a year old.
<lsalsa>	admittedly, i'm getting the apple watch
*	lsalsa runs
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa: lol
<Agamemnus>	LE22S: yes, you're right. I'm agnostic
<lsalsa>	trying to look for the design i made
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa: I dont like OS X partly because im not used to it, I used it for months but still i dont like it
<lsalsa>	it's for a torrent site, admittedly
<Agamemnus>	The problem with fixing it is that I can't stop there. I have to have them fix it on their official version
<lsalsa>	like thepiratebay
<lsalsa>	i hate how they look and interact
<Agamemnus>	Speaking of fixes, I need to fix my plugin
<lsalsa>	it's just a horrible experience, so i made this.
<comingsoontm>	lol we arent even talking about javascript where are the MODS CALL THE MODS RIGHT NOW
<lsalsa>	and if you hate it, just tell me, deltab especially, because you've just been so helpful/honest
<GreenDog>	ya, i was never able to get comfortable with osx either
<Le22S>	osx for dayz
<comingsoontm>	GreenDog: :D
<comingsoontm>	dayz the game ?
<Le22S>	nope
<lsalsa>	GreenDog: i spent all night with my first mac, i was comfortable after that.
<Le22S>	DAYS
<Le22S>	FOR DAYS
<Le22S>	<3
<lsalsa>	so this is my design for a torrent site.
<lsalsa>	http://i.imgur.com/3DJUSgR.png
<comingsoontm>	aah the movie :okay:
*	Le22S cries
<lsalsa>	imagine kickass.to or thepirateb
<GreenDog>	ya, most people are pretty comfy with it...i just couldn't get there
<lsalsa>	i spent 30 minutes on it
<lsalsa>	i know its wrong to download films and stuff, but
<lsalsa>	yeah, that was my first design last week.
<comingsoontm>	nothing good comes after that ' but '
<Agamemnus>	too dark
<GreenDog>	win is too ingrained in me i guess
<Agamemnus>	I like the year idea.
<lsalsa>	:(
<Agamemnus>	Fight the power. I pay oodles for my network cable, but I don't want to miss episodes because they have a dispute with a network.
<GreenDog>	i think the fact that xcode would crash every 5 minutes turned me off too
<Kosre>	lsalsa, love the design
<Maxdamantus>	“Stream property”
<Agamemnus>	Or because their power went down, or some other BS
<Maxdamantus>	so does this mean we can download cars now?
<lsalsa>	Kosre: :D
<Agamemnus>	sports game cutting off network tv
<lsalsa>	Maxdamantus: well, uber is doing a food thing, so
*	snaps_ is now known as Guest58940
<lsalsa>	god, how do i get this border transparent
<lsalsa>	sec
<Le22S>	i wish i had time to watch tv
<Le22S>	somebody help
<Agamemnus>	you have to get rid of all the Game of Thrones references
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa: i see you have swift books, did you learn swift ?
<Agamemnus>	Le22S: what is it?
<lsalsa>	Agamemnus: it's because GoT was trending last week
<Le22S>	Agamemnus: i work 90 hours a week
<lsalsa>	comingsoontm: oh no, not yet. i bought designcode.io and haven't had the time
<Agamemnus>	i see
<lsalsa>	sort of been having problems with my life
<Le22S>	somebody needs to throw me a lifebuoy
<Agamemnus>	Here are the things I'd like to have in a torrent site.
<Agamemnus>	1) Good text.
<Agamemnus>	2) No sleazy ads (you make no money)
<Agamemnus>	3) Year filter is a good one
<Agamemnus>	4) Has to be American English
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa: omg how do they nicely bundle this stuff and the website design... you could almost believe in an Apple conspiracy
<lsalsa>	Agamemnus: so ... it's perfect?
<Agamemnus>	5) Easy access to subtitles
<lsalsa>	Agamemnus: well American English is wrong English.
<lsalsa>	Agamemnus: there's an app for the subtitle thing.
<Agamemnus>	6) Doesn't get shut down in 5 days
<GreenDog>	Agamemnus: You should make that
<comingsoontm>	99) Legal stuff
<lsalsa>	Agamemnus: if i design it, would you build it?
<comingsoontm>	100) No illegal stuff
<Agamemnus>	I search for subtitles on the net, takes me 30 minutes to find the right subtitle sometimes
<Agamemnus>	a lot of trash subtitles
<lsalsa>	Agamemnus: oh no, do you use a mac?
<Agamemnus>	i would not build it, because i would have to be based on the Moon for it to not get shut down
<GreenDog>	i wanted to make a subtitles app for google glasses
<Le22S>	from experience, unless you have a decent amount of cash and a solid connection to BP servers, you aren't going to host a successful torrent site.
<Agamemnus>	Windows
<GreenDog>	bu google wanted $1500
<lsalsa>	Agamemnus: ah, http://subtitlesapp.com/
<Maxdamantus>	Agamemnus: find single moms in your area.
<lsalsa>	Agamemnus: there's a windows port.
<lsalsa>	Agamemnus: drag and drop subtitles
<Agamemnus>	I'll try that. But the problem is, people make subtitles
<Agamemnus>	and no one rates them appropriately
<lsalsa>	i'm suspicious of everything made with a .exe
<lsalsa>	Agamemnus: yeah, but these have so far been very good verbally and timely.
<Le22S>	http://thesubdb.com/
<Agamemnus>	And they did steal your bank account info, but that is a small price to pay....
<Maxdamantus>	16:02:25 < Agamemnus> i would not build it, because i would have to be based on the Moon for it to not get shut down
<Maxdamantus>	There are far easier solutions.
<Seikho_>	kickstart a moon dev house
<Maxdamantus>	You can make distributed systems.
<Agamemnus>	All the The Pirate Bay founders are in jail
<GreenDog>	ahhh! the moon!
<Agamemnus>	or, a lot of them
<DragonPunch>	MOON
<lsalsa>	Agamemnus: i don't think i'm afraid of that
<Seikho_>	china is going there soon
<Seikho_>	hitch a ride
<DragonPunch>	moon dev house
<lsalsa>	if i have a product
<Agamemnus>	I don't want to go to jail
<lsalsa>	and a million people use it
*	Maxdamantus is moving the Moon right now.
<GreenDog>	You'd be arrested even if the server were on the moon
<lsalsa>	i don't mind the fear of prison
<Agamemnus>	I don't feel like learning Mandarin
<Agamemnus>	I'll live on the moon
<GreenDog>	you don't?!
<lsalsa>	i'm in africa
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa: there is no internet in the prison. Aha now you are scared !!
<Agamemnus>	Doesn't the UN have jurisdiction on the moon?
<lsalsa>	does anyone know css want to help me out with a border
<lsalsa>	https://jsfiddle.net/7qdmxcjw/25/
<GreenDog>	Nope, the USA does
<lsalsa>	i have a bunch of text in the card section id
<Maxdamantus>	Noone really does.
<lsalsa>	i want a border so it covers that text, but it's still transparent
<lsalsa>	Maxdamantus: oh, oh well
<L8D>	lsalsa: you want the green part to go behind the text?
<Agamemnus>	the body element needs to be size of the background
<Agamemnus>	and you need to get rid of the margins
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa: why a border ? the background is enough no ?
<lsalsa>	comingsoontm: trying to make two borders
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa: you can add a padding yo center the text in the inside and have space, use the border for borders not space
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa: hmm okay continue
<lsalsa>	comingsoontm: let me design something relaly quick so you get what i want
<Agamemnus>	Here's an idea
<Agamemnus>	Use two backgrounds
<Agamemnus>	Make the image background smaller than the other (solid) one
<Agamemnus>	you can put two backgrounds on the same element
<Agamemnus>	or more, or whatever
<Agamemnus>	don't use IDs
<lsalsa>	comingsoontm: what i want is this http://i.imgur.com/357LlkJ.png
<lsalsa>	a border at the bottom where i have a border at the top already
<lsalsa>	comingsoontm: this is the code. https://jsfiddle.net/7qdmxcjw/17/
<lsalsa>	i can't figure out the bottom one.
<Agamemnus>	just think of it in terms of layers
<lsalsa>	and i want the top one to extend upward so that people on iphones see the border from their blur thing
<lsalsa>	Agamemnus: yeah, but i don't know css.
<Agamemnus>	the white area is the image background?
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa: ill get back to you
<Agamemnus>	You should make that an actual element. Don't make it the body background
<Agamemnus>	don't overcomplicate things
<Agamemnus>	round pegs don't go in square holes or whatever
<Agamemnus>	or square pegs in round holes
<lsalsa>	ok Steve.
<lsalsa>	comingsoontm: where are you going :(
<lsalsa>	Agamemnus: the white area is the image background i've had on the site that you've seen since yeah.
<lsalsa>	i just want a transparent border at the bottom
<lsalsa>	then a small border at the top which blurs for iphones.
<lsalsa>	then i'm done with this site.
<lsalsa>	i thought for the top i would need to do something like border-bottom: -100px solid; or something but yeah, i'm bad at this.
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa: I have 1 opinion first, its like a technical opinion im not getting in your stuff :D, but is it really a good idea to have that green stip just for iphone users ?
<Agamemnus>	also, you need to use normalize.css always
<Agamemnus>	four important points about CSS
<Agamemnus>	1) use normalize.css
<Agamemnus>	2) don't overcomplicate it. KISS
<Agamemnus>	3) Classes FTW.
<Kosre>	lsalsa, will you be using media queries to change the css for smaller resolution screens?
<lsalsa>	comingsoontm: it's for a brand, it's representative of that brand
<Agamemnus>	4) On bigger projects, consider preprocessors
<Agamemnus>	LESS, SASS, etc.
<lsalsa>	i have /stylesheets/normalize.css  /stylesheets/master.css" and <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa: if someone comes with an android phone he will see a useless green strip on top ?
<Agamemnus>	Oh and (5): Remember that CSS is designed around top to bottom, left to right
<lsalsa>	comingsoontm: sigh
<Agamemnus>	absolute and relative positioning is what you want to use
<lsalsa>	comingsoontm: okay, i'll just create a semi transparent bottom border
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa: fine it was just my opinion :D
<lsalsa>	but i don't know how
<comingsoontm>	bottom border ?
<comingsoontm>	ok wait I think I dont understand you
<comingsoontm>	why is there a 'Desktop HD' written there ?
<comingsoontm>	isnt that supposed to be the most top of the page ?
<Agamemnus>	i am making something also
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa: ping
<Agamemnus>	https://jsfiddle.net/agamemnus/7qdmxcjw/26/
<Agamemnus>	Maybe I totally misunderstood what you wanted, but
<lsalsa>	Kosre: yeah, i hope so
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa: here you go https://jsfiddle.net/7qdmxcjw/27/
<lsalsa>	comingsoontm: i'm here
<lsalsa>	comingsoontm: i mean like a bottom layer
<lsalsa>	okay one sec
<lsalsa>	i'll get my own jsfiddle username thing once i can fiddle with js properly :D
<bros>	Why would somebody write this: users.slice(0, idx).concat(users.slice(idx + 1));
<bros>	Instead of splicing?
<bros>	Is splice new or something?
<ljharb>	bros: because splice mutates
<ljharb>	and mutating things is bad news bears
<bros>	What does mutate mean?
<ljharb>	it modifies it in-place.
<ljharb>	slice creates a new array.
<bros>	Is one faster than the other?
<ljharb>	>> var a = [1,2,3]; [a.splice(1, 1), a] @ bros
<ecmabot>	bros: (object) [[2], [1, 3]]
<ljharb>	faster is basically always irrelevant
<ljharb>	i'm sure splice is a bit faster, but that's not useful.
<lsalsa>	ok it sort of looks like what i want i can fiddle with it and get it just perfect, comingsoontm Agamemnus thanks.
<quillford>	what is the best way to read a file to a string?
<lsalsa>	wanted it to float and stick to the bottom
<bros>	In that example, the user reassigns the variable directly after slicing.  users = users.slice(0, idx).concat(users.slice(idx + 1));
<ljharb>	quillford: in a browser you can't read a file
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa: :)
<lsalsa>	so i get i have to use some trickery i'll w3schools it
<bros>	he should have just spliced?
<ljharb>	bros: not necessarily
<ezakimak>	but if you want to mutate, why not?
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa: noooooooooooo mdn it
<Agamemnus>	what do you want to float?
<ljharb>	bros: if anything else still had a reference to the original array, then splice would have affected them too
<ljharb>	ezakimak: because you don't really :-)
<lsalsa>	comingsoontm: mdn?
<Agamemnus>	It is just always a bad idea to put things in the body
<quillford>	ljharb: not even with filereader?
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa: mozilla developer network
<ljharb>	ezakimak: it makes code harder to reason about.
<lsalsa>	Agamemnus: the grey thingy, i want it to be hooked to the bottom
<ezakimak>	you can read a file from the browser
<comingsoontm>	lsalsa: dont use w3schools
<bros>	ljharb: ah. ok. it is a haskell developer, so i guess he'd want stateless things, yes?
<lsalsa>	Agamemnus: transparent
<ljharb>	quillford: if the user has selected it, yes
<ljharb>	bros: yes
<lsalsa>	comingsoontm: why not?
<ljharb>	!w3schools @ lsalsa
<ecmabot>	lsalsa: W3Schools is not related to the W3C and has many problems: http://w3fools.com/

<Agamemnus>	The white area is the background, or what?
<ljharb>	quillford: there's a few methods of reading the file
<Agamemnus>	if you want the bottom with text to be gray, change the background-color
<quillford>	thank ljharb
<lsalsa>	ecmabot: lool okay
<lsalsa>	man, there's always a good and a bad for resources
<Agamemnus>	however, you usually don't want background to be gray
<lsalsa>	without irc, most people just suck
<ljharb>	lsalsa: w3schools is a horrible site.
<Agamemnus>	usually you want light colors, or white
<ezakimak>	maybe he's depressed.
<bros>	ljharb: thank you very much!
<Agamemnus>	I actually joined the mdn documentation mailing list
<ljharb>	np
<ezakimak>	or his client demands it
<Agamemnus>	I suggested some changes to remove/hide the deprecated stuff by default
<Agamemnus>	There was some discussion about it, but nothing was done
<Agamemnus>	i think that is the worst part on mdn
<Agamemnus>	scrolling needs to be less
<comingsoontm>	Agamemnus: you complain about everything lol
<Agamemnus>	true

<Agamemnus>	by then tho, i'll be only be able to afford a single burger for it
<lsalsa>	okay, one more idiot question
<preaction>	i'll hold you to that
<lsalsa>	how do i make the border/layer span the entire screen in width
<Agamemnus>	width: 100%
<lsalsa>	width:100% goes past the screen, and doesn't start at the edge of the left
<lsalsa>	for some reason
<comingsoontm>	everyone missing my point
<comingsoontm>	and joking about encyclopedia britannica
<Agamemnus>	be sure to have box-sizing: border-box;
<GreenDog>	and margin:0
<Agamemnus>	comingsoontm: missing your point... by a mile!
<Agamemnus>	but, yes, ok, you are right

<lsalsa>	margin:0 doesn't fix it
<comingsoontm>	Agamemnus: lol

<Agamemnus>	just use esperanto

<Agamemnus>	:(
<Agamemnus>	I would never do that in French as I only took 2 years of French
<Agamemnus>	I'll speak two words of French and then go full-on English..
<comingsoontm>	then go full-on google translate

<lsalsa>	Agamemnus: it's not i promise
<Agamemnus>	welllllllll
<lsalsa>	on a normal page
<Agamemnus>	ok, what do you want to change now?
<lsalsa>	the margin isn't to the edge of the page
<Agamemnus>	just use my css as a base, this is all awful
<lsalsa>	for the black bar
<Agamemnus>	you can't be styling the body
<lsalsa>	ok
<Agamemnus>	are you using Chrome to debug?
<lsalsa>	i'm using chrome, but i'm not familiar with debugging, so it's a bit of a difficult topic
<Kosre>	Agamemnus, you thinking dev tools to see the css?
<Agamemnus>	yes. Elements
<Agamemnus>	if chrome
<Agamemnus>	otherwise firebug
<comingsoontm>	you can code the css and save it in crhome dev tools, but I dont trust chrome enough to give disk access
<Agamemnus>	the problem is that contact is not 0 margin
<lsalsa>	i need a ton of browsers
<Agamemnus>	you need normalize.css, don't forget that
<Kosre>	Agamemnus, looks like contact has margin top and bottom, why would that affect the left/right scroll?
<Agamemnus>	h1 has a non-0 margin too
<Agamemnus>	i don't know, i can't think without normalize.css

<lsalsa>	cheers comingsoontm, Chees
<lsalsa>	if i want to move text in a box (like the black box) should i use text-align: center; or should i use padding: 50% or something?
<comingsoontm>	center vertically or horizontally ?
<lsalsa>	and to think i used emacs once.
<lsalsa>	comingsoontm: center horizontally
<comingsoontm>	text-align:center
<lsalsa>	nod
<lsalsa>	thought that might be it, thanks.
<jskid>	I want to use .length on object, But in some cases it might throw a type error, I want to use 'undefined' or 'null' instead of that. Should I do type checking for that or Is there anything like 'rescue' in ruby?
<L8D>	jskid: of course there is
<doc|work>	you can do if (var === undefined)
<L8D>	jskid: try/catch
<falafel>	finally
<falafel>	but why would it throw a type error?
<falafel>	if the property `length` of an object doesn't exist, then it will return `undefined`
<falafel>	>>{}.length @ jskid
<ecmabot>	jskid: SyntaxError: syntax error
<falafel>	>>({}).length @ jskid
<ecmabot>	jskid: undefined
<jskid>	sometimes it might be like null.length , I want to avoid type error in that case.
<falafel>	then I think you should check to see if it is an object first
<falafel>	instead of using try/catch
<DragonPunch>	how do you completely remove an element because im removing a div that contains an element but it's being weird. whenever i open that div back up that it still has that same child element that i removed earlier.
<Sorella>	jskid: stop having all types flowing through that method and you'll have zero problems with this. IOW, pass the correct types to your functions instead of checking things in them
<jskid>	@Sorella I think I have to do type chceking before that, I'm a ruby programmer and this can solved by a simple rescue nil in ruby
<Sorella>	jskid: WHY do you have null there in the first place?
<doc|work>	DragonPunch: delete variable
<Sorella>	(And that's clearly not true. For example, Haskell does away entirely with the existence of global null values, and programming in it is much more enjoyable because it's *impossible* for any value to be `null`)
<NBhosting>	when i do player1HomeEl.append(element); multiple times, it adds the element on the same spot once
<Nazral>	hi
<jskid>	one more doubt, In switch case, does it check with == or ===?
<Sorella>	jskid: ===
<jskid>	@Sorella I think I did some irresponsible thing before :D
<Nazral>	I have a problem with bind(). I have an object with a parameter this.animation = function(anim, canv) { var bAnim = anim.bind(this); bAnim(canv); }
<Havvy>	>> switch (5) { case "5": console.log("=="); break; case 5: console.log("==="); break; }
<ecmabot>	Havvy: undefined; Console: '==='
<NBhosting>	ah ofc, had to eb a new element :P
<Nazral>	inside my anim function there is a set interval which will stop if this.on is set to false
<Sorella>	jskid: then fix that instead. If you let problems flow through your code, you'll end up having to FIX the problem in your whole code base, instead of just one place.
<Nazral>	it doesn't seem to be able to detect changes
<jskid>	@Sorella I will do that, one more doubt, In switch case, does it check with == or ===?
<Sorella>	jskid: we've answered that twice.
<jskid>	@Sorella I missed that, sorry and thank you

<Eppiox>	Howdy, wondering if anyone has/knows of a light 4 point image skew script? Trying to make an isometric thingy... but also manipulate angles slightly so want to preserve the skew and not just use pre-skewed sprites
<doc|work>	I'm trying to use a tilelayer with leafletjs but am getting a grey block above the tiles in the map. Anyone know why this might be? The ones lower down are loading up fine, and I get a bunch of 404s like _4095_1.jpg instead of more reasonable numbers.
<doc|work>	Eppiox: I've done this, with css.
<doc|work>	Eppiox: honestly, it's not something I ever want to try to explain over IRC :) Best to read the css3 transform docs
<Eppiox>	yeah, not touching css with this- outright won't work
<doc|work>	why?
<Eppiox>	they are sprites on a canvas, need to preserve them as that
<cyberbrai>	Green jello it's not work
<doc|work>	Eppiox: aren't you screwed either way? JS or CSS, doesn't matter
<Eppiox>	Well, with js I can skew it once, save that skew and duplicate it 100's of times without re-skewing the image:)
<doc|work>	save it how?
<Eppiox>	mm not sure how it works, found something that can take what is on a canvas and make it its own image that you can use
<doc|work>	also, you'll be using js to skew an image, if that's even possible, rather than using css which will be hardware accelerated in many cases, to do the same thing, and there's no half-baked 3rd party script
<doc|work>	with the css version
<Eppiox>	I've done css skews when I've been messing with sites, I find it works but for it to work in this it would be horribly clunky, if anyone else knows of a script or class that can do it (without css) would be nice
<Eppiox>	http://jsfiddle.net/xjHUk/86/  dam I knew as soon I asked it would turn up in google, curse my google skills http://jsfiddle.net/xjHUk/86/
<yoshuawuyts>	Just released an article on ES6 symbols, might be useful for some - https://medium.com/@yoshuawuyts/party-tricks-with-es6-symbols-ee328fdb6c4b

<Agamemnus>	yoshuawuyts:
<Eppiox>	true.. :/
*	doc|work stabs leaflet in the face
<Agamemnus>	I don't get your last example.
<Agamemnus>	"Foo" anything makes me very confused
<Agamemnus>	why can't you do this without symbols?
<yoshuawuyts>	Agamemnus: true anonimity isn't possible without symbols unless you're relying on closures
<Maxdamantus>	Agamemnus: because you can only access the properties if you have access to the `key` symbol.
<yoshuawuyts>	^ this
<Agamemnus>	I don't get it.
<Agamemnus>	Why can't you do it without symbols?
<Maxdamantus>	yoshuawuyts: you're still relying on closure.
<Maxdamantus>	yoshuawuyts: you need something to close over the `key` variable.
<Havvy>	Agamemnus:  Because you can always enumerate through strings to find the name of the `private` key.
<Maxdamantus>	Agamemnus: try writing the code you think works.
<yoshuawuyts>	Maxdamantus: yeah, but in this case we're only storing the Symbol inside the closure rather than actual values
<Agamemnus>	why can't you just use var?
<yoshuawuyts>	Maxdamantus: which prevents any type of conflict from occuring when generating multiple isntances of the same thing
<Maxdamantus>	Agamemnus: why can't you just use elephants?
<Agamemnus>	nope, i don't get it
<yoshuawuyts>	ps also posted it to HN, upvotes are appreciated if you think it's a useful read - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9463565
<Agamemnus>	it is not a secret key either
<Maxdamantus>	yoshuawuyts: you can get the same level of privateness using closure in other ways.
<Agamemnus>	there is a difference between secret and private
<Maxdamantus>	yoshuawuyts: (non-obvious ways)
<sweb>	is there any method for using Intl Javascript datetime formatter like yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm
<Maxdamantus>	Agamemnus: it is secret.
<Agamemnus>	i can see it
<sweb>	i cant find any pattern formatter in datetimeformatter in Intl datetime formatter
<yoshuawuyts>	Maxdamantus: yeah, but they're annoying to deal with, hah
<Agamemnus>	console.log(foo.key) gives
<yoshuawuyts>	Agamemnus: if you require it in another file you lose access to the Symbol, making it private
<Agamemnus>	 'my secret key'
<Agamemnus>	so how did you make it private, anyway
<yoshuawuyts>	Agamemnus: only because of the getter. Removing the getter would make it impossible to access the value inside
<Maxdamantus>	Agamemnus: that's because it's using the getter which uses `key`
<Agamemnus>	I don't like your example.
<Maxdamantus>	https://gist.github.com/Maxdamantus/1393215
<Maxdamantus>	(that actually needs to be defined in strict mode, otherwise you can break stuff by accessing .caller)
<Agamemnus>	why are you using const?
<Maxdamantus>	Why not?
<yoshuawuyts>	Agamemnus: it's a safer default than var and let
<yoshuawuyts>	Agamemnus: everything immutable by default, unless you need to change it. You'll find that mutability is the exception rather than the standard.
<yoshuawuyts>	Agamemnus: at least, I found that to be the way in my own code.
<Agamemnus>	how does it apply to the example
<Agamemnus>	http://jsfiddle.net/agamemnus/ffg0x93v/ this is what I would do as an example
<Agamemnus>	Strip out extraneous things.
<Maxdamantus>	What's the point of setting a property that's never accessed?
<Agamemnus>	To show that it's private.
<Agamemnus>	One concept at a time, otherwise known as KISS
<yoshuawuyts>	yeah, think I'll remove the setter
<Agamemnus>	Thanks...
<yoshuawuyts>	was kind of assuming people'd know about getters / setters
<falafel>	you dont use `new` with Symbol
<yoshuawuyts>	wooops
<yoshuawuyts>	you're right
<Agamemnus>	show an example of it being accessed inside the function
<Agamemnus>	as well
<Agamemnus>	not with a getter/setter
<yoshuawuyts>	falafel: thanks for catching that, fixed
<falafel>	Agamemnus, mytest[key]?
<Agamemnus>	That should make an error, or not?
<Maxdamantus>	yoshuawuyts: I think he was referring to Agamemnus.
<Agamemnus>	Outside the function
<Maxdamantus>	You're not *meant* to use `new` with Symbol.
<falafel>	Agamemnus, http://jsfiddle.net/ffg0x93v/1/
<Agamemnus>	he had the same error
<Agamemnus>	Like this:
<Agamemnus>	console.log (this[key]) // Yay!
<Agamemnus>	Inside the function
<Agamemnus>	Or rather
<yoshuawuyts>	Updated the final example, hope it's clearer now - https://gist.github.com/yoshuawuyts/061106e875de11c0229d
<Agamemnus>	"// Yay, no errors!"
<Agamemnus>	I don't like the getter and the "if (!(this instaneof Foo)) return new Foo()"
<Agamemnus>	http://jsfiddle.net/agamemnus/ffg0x93v/2/
<Agamemnus>	You don't need a setter, or a getter. Just show that it can be accessed inside the function, but not outside
<Maxdamantus>	instaneof
<Agamemnus>	And, it's private, it's not secret. It can't be secret.
<bros>	I just wrote the same websocket code in node that I did in haskell. node has 20% CPU usage, 100mb memory while haskell has 2% CPU usage, 3mb memory.
<falafel>	Agamemnus, what are you showing? tt can be accesed outside...
<Agamemnus>	Secret has a very specific meaning
<Agamemnus>	falafel: WHAT?
<Agamemnus>	Then I am at a total loss
<falafel>	Agamemnus, just check the console on the example you just posted
<falafel>	prints the value twice, once inside, once outside
<yoshuawuyts>	Maxdamantus: fixed it 2 secs before you mentioned it. Thanks for catching though ^^
<falafel>	what you can do is not export the symbol
<falafel>	so people have no direct access
<falafel>	but it is still an enumerable property
<GreenJello>	bros, sounds about right :-)
<Agamemnus>	So that's with using the file as a module
*	pulse_ is now known as pulse
<Agamemnus>	Better show the whole thing in action, with require or whatever
<Agamemnus>	IT's still not secret. It's private.
<falafel>	what is "private"?
<Agamemnus>	The idea is always not to overload people's memory
<Agamemnus>	Private would mean that you can't access its value as a property
<Agamemnus>	Secret means you can't access it value, but you can. (you can look at the source)
<falafel>	ok, but if you got the symbol, you can access it
<Agamemnus>	With code
<Agamemnus>	Well
<Agamemnus>	Yes.
<Agamemnus>	You can access it even as a Symbol
<Agamemnus>	you can read the code
<Agamemnus>	But the idea is to help the programmer not access something they shouldn't
<Agamemnus>	Not to make something SECRET
<Agamemnus>	You shouldn't pretend it's secret.
<Agamemnus>	It has grave consequences.
<Agamemnus>	I'll refer you to the Twitter earnings report leak two days ago.
<GreenJello>	https://gist.github.com/brigand/bc06d53def0cb447a801
<Agamemnus>	It was put up without a direct link, but it was still there...
<GreenJello>	yoshuawuyts, might as well go all out with es6 syntax :-)
<yoshuawuyts>	GreenJello: meaning classes? haven't really touched those yet :p
<GreenJello>	er updated, new Foo()
<Agamemnus>	:(
<Agamemnus>	I was wondering about that one, GreenJello
<GreenJello>	either make it a lower case function that just returns an object, or call it with new
<Agamemnus>	the first is really better even though it's more verbose
<yoshuawuyts>	GreenJello: referring to this example? https://gist.github.com/yoshuawuyts/061106e875de11c0229d
<Agamemnus>	On a side note, why can't we set a return value in a function?
<GreenJello>	yoshuawuyts, yeah
<Agamemnus>	Using a blank object will require you to return the object at the end of the functino.
<Agamemnus>	function
<Agamemnus>	YOU MIGHT FORGET!
<yoshuawuyts>	Agamemnus: hmm, I'm not following
<Agamemnus>	From a pedagogical (sp?) and error probability perspective
<yoshuawuyts>	GreenJello: I'm kind of down for classes on this example (does away with the instanceof check), but would need to look into how
<Agamemnus>	: If you use "new", you might forget to use it. Or use it when you shouldn't.
<Agamemnus>	Or, you use the instanceof check. But it's verbose.
<Agamemnus>	If you make a blank object and then return it, I think that's better.
<Maxdamantus>	https://gist.github.com/Maxdamantus/e6107499ec889e1bcbd7
<Agamemnus>	But then you need to return it at the end of the function. Visually. You might forget.
<Agamemnus>	ok, you can do that.
<Agamemnus>	but that is moar brackets.
<GreenJello>	yoshuawuyts, it throws if there's no `new` operator with classes
<GreenJello>	or here's with a simple function: https://gist.github.com/brigand/f07822cdb368fe8bdd49
<Agamemnus>	Also, it's slightly difficult to mix and match, if you're adding/removing functions
<Agamemnus>	I would prefer to see a return value setter
<Agamemnus>	(could make for some GNARLY code, though)
<GreenJello>	yoshuawuyts, and probably the simplest: https://gist.github.com/brigand/3c44f31b663894a0d0d1
<yoshuawuyts>	GreenJello: I kind of like your example
<GreenJello>	no prototypes, or inheritance, just an object :-)
<Agamemnus>	I like that last one.
<Agamemnus>	It's still private... but... okay
<Agamemnus>	i'll datamine Symbol declarations to find secrets
<yoshuawuyts>	GreenJello: didn't know you could use ['something'] as a key
<yoshuawuyts>	GreenJello: thanks for sharing!
<GreenJello>	well yeah, to be clear you can get a list of symbols on an object
<GreenJello>	!mdn getownpropertysymbols
<ecmabot>	GreenJello: Object.getOwnPropertySymbols() - JavaScript | MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getOwnPropertySymbols>
<Maxdamantus>	GreenJello: key? KEY?
<Agamemnus>	Hmm
<GreenJello>	Maxdamantus, thanks
<Agamemnus>	Maybe ES6 isn't case-sensitive
<Agamemnus>	:P
<GreenJello>	haha
<Agamemnus>	If you don't use anything, is it automatically const or whatever?
<GreenJello>	yeah the original had 'key' and key, which confused me to see
<hevar>	Hi guys, I want a create a simple website that shows your levitation based on your adress (found through your IP) or the entered geocode.
<GreenJello>	Agamemnus, if you don't use anything it's an error
<hevar>	But Im in need of some help, since Im stuck. I'm using http://ipinfo.io/ to track the users geolocation through the IP. It returns the geolocation as the response.loc (shown in the code below).
<Maxdamantus>	hevar: you mean altitude?
<GreenJello>	Agamemnus, in es6 modules are 'use strict'
<hevar>	how many meterers over the sea a sertain location is
<Agamemnus>	I think I'm still a bit lost.
<hevar>	here is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/dgufeyjd/
<Maxdamantus>	That site has me in a different city on a different island.
<GreenJello>	oh a typo
<Maxdamantus>	about 1000 km away
<hevar>	its using your IP
<GreenJello>	it was accurate to 25 miles for me
<Agamemnus>	Maxdamantus, are you a secret agent for Micronesia?
<Maxdamantus>	No.
<Agamemnus>	I forgot where you lived.
<Maxdamantus>	You can't accurately determine someone's altitude from their IP address.
<Agamemnus>	There's a probability that you can.
<Maxdamantus>	There's no standard to how specifically geographically distributed they are.
<hevar>	What I need help with is to use the geolocation found through the ip as the default value on the google maps
<Agamemnus>	Unless you're on a plane it should be good for many people
<Agamemnus>	IP->lat/long->geographical data
<hevar>	It doesnt need to be accurate, i'm just messing around and trying to learn
<Maxdamantus>	or using an ISP that select addresses from a nation-wide pool.

<yoshuawuyts>	GreenJello: updated the article with your final example. Thanks for sharing!
<Agamemnus>	GreenJello: "console.log(foo[Symbol('my key')])" ... no one writes this though
<GreenJello>	yoshuawuyts, cool :-)
<GreenJello>	Agamemnus, that was yoshuawuyts's, and it's showing that Symbol('my key') and Symbol('my key') are different
<Agamemnus>	WHAT???
<GreenJello>	b> Symbol('my key') === Symbol('my key')
<babelbot>	GreenJello: false
<Agamemnus>	okay
<Agamemnus>	okay okay
<GreenJello>	the string is just for debugging, and the global symbol registry
<Agamemnus>	but the practical use is to make sure that foo.key and foo[key] return undefined
<DragonPunch>	anyone?
<hevar>	GreenJello: Can you please add it the jsfiddle? Im not really sure what to do with it
<DragonPunch>	when you upload a file does the extension show as

<Agamemnus>	DragonPunch: is that PHP?
<GreenJello>	hevar, instead of the string you put response.loc
<DragonPunch>	no its javascript

<cyberbrai>	my onclick function is not running in modal box why the selector i am used is right
<cyberbrai>	it works fine in normal html
<cyberbrai>		but not in modal box
<cyberbrai>		plz help me
<cyberbrai>	any one there
<yoshuawuyts>	GreenJello: ^____________^
<Agamemnus>	Where would you see the file extension?
<Agamemnus>	!onclick @cyberbari
<ecmabot>	cyberbari: Using inline event handlers is bad practice and results in poorly factored, hard-to-manage code. Consider attaching your events with Javascript, instead, eg: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener
<Nazral>	Hi! http://pastebin.com/fxLNq4Er why doesn't the setInterval stop ?
<Agamemnus>	goodnight guys
<GreenJello>	Nazral, how have you determined it doesn't stop?
<cyberbrai>	Agamemnus yes onclick it's work fine on normal html but not in modal box
<Maxdamantus>	b> var s1 = Symbol("foo"), s2 = Symbol("foo"), o = { [s1]: "one", [s2]: "two", [s1 + s2]: "three", [s2 + s1]: "four" }; [s1, s2, s1 + s2, s2 + s1].map(function(s){ return o[s]; });
<babelbot>	Maxdamantus: [ 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four' ]
<Agamemnus>	Nazral: because it already ran.
<ljharb>	Nazral: that should work. but, don't use setinterval.
<ljharb>	Nazral: also you can just do `anim.call(this, canv)`
<cyberbrai>	Agamemnus any solution
<ljharb>	Nazral: try making a jsfiddle. and try console.logging that.on inside the interval
<Agamemnus>	cyberbrai: a modal box is just some JS... not a standard element. So, can't know unless you show the code
<Agamemnus>	preferrably as a test case
<Agamemnus>	later
<cyberbrai>	bootstrap modal box
<cyberbrai>	Agamemnus
<Nazral>	ljharb: why shouldn't I use setInterval ?
<GreenJello>	cyberbrai, he left, you're on your own here
<Nazral>	GreenJello: because the animation doesn't stop
<GreenJello>	Nazral, the code you sent just starts an interval, and doesn't do anything else
<cyberbrai>	yup Green jello
<Nazral>	(I change the value from true to false after 3 seconds)
<GreenJello>	if this isn't your actual code could you paste that?
<Nazral>	sure
<ljharb>	!setinterval @ Nazral
<ecmabot>	Nazral: Avoid setInterval; use setTimeout instead. http://zetafleet.com/blog/why-i-consider-setinterval-harmful
<ljharb>	Nazral: use a recursive setTimeout instead.
<barkbarkmoon>	is there a way (even a browser-specific one) to get the line number of a node in JS?
<Nazral>	http://pastebin.com/15RDkSWk there
<ljharb>	Nazral: that will also mean you can "stop the interval" without any "this" nonsense.
<ljharb>	barkbarkmoon: what's "a node"
<barkbarkmoon>	HTMLElement
<ljharb>	!raf @ Nazral
<ecmabot>	Nazral: For animations, requestAnimationFrame is far superior to setTimeout. http://paulirish.com/2011/requestanimationframe-for-smart-animating/ To cover older browsers, use this polyfill: https://gist.github.com/1579671
<ljharb>	Nazral: always do drawing stuff in a requestAnimationFrame.
<ljharb>	barkbarkmoon: how would an htmlelement have a line number
<ljharb>	barkbarkmoon: considering that elements don't only come from the initial html
<barkbarkmoon>	I know, but maybe some browsers create a map
<barkbarkmoon>	or something
<Nazral>	ljharb: ok thanks I'll do that
<barkbarkmoon>	when they build the DOM
<H3>	greenjello: (changed to my irc client from the webchat), I’m sorry but I have tried out pasting it in and i cant get it to work
<H3>	http://jsfiddle.net/dgufeyjd/
<GreenJello>	H3, the main problem is you need to call initialize from the $.get callback
<GreenJello>	and you need to pass the response object to it, so it has access to that information
<Nazral>	so in my (function loop() {})(); can I use the this keyword directly or do I need to use a var that=this or a bind ?
<GreenJello>	Nazral, did you paste the code?
<Nazral>	yes
<Nazral>	http://pastebin.com/15RDkSWk there
*	wa5ted_ is now known as wa5ted
<GreenJello>	ah missed it, sorry
<Nazral>	the problem is in function testDraw and in the Cell constructor
<Nazral>	(line 8 and line 94/line 106)
<GreenJello>	where is cAnim called?
<H3>	GreenJello: yeah, and since im faily new to js i dont really know how to pass that info to the google maps API
<Nazral>	GreenJello: never called, it's just in prevision
<Nazral>	line 159 I call the animation though
<ljharb>	Nazral: ideally you never use "this" anywhere.
<ljharb>	Nazral: it's always cleaner to use an explicit argument.
*	michd is now known as MichD
<H3>	still no luck. I’ve gone though a couple of tut videos but still dont know how to send the $. response.loc to the google api and use it as the default value
<H3>	for var latlng
<H3>	http://jsfiddle.net/dgufeyjd/
<Nazral>	ljharb: like ? doing var this = that ?
<ljharb>	Nazral: no like not using "new" or "this" ever
<Nazral>	ok I tried this: http://pastebin.com/8C1QkHhm (see line 9, 60, 62), the animation still doesn't stop when I change the on parameter of the cell
<H3>	greenjello: are you still there?
*	erdem_ is now known as hollusion
<Nazral>	ljharb: so I'm not supposed to use methods ?
<ljharb>	Nazral: generally yes, it's better to have standalone pure functions
<Nazral>	why ?
<ljharb>	Nazral: "this" makes it much harder to reason about what your code is doing. a pure standalone function can be easily tested, doesn't have side effects, and is really easy to see what's happening.
<Nazral>	doesn't that defeats the fact that js is object oriented though ?
<ljharb>	it's only kind of object-oriented. and that also isn't the only way you can use it. OO isn't even the best way to organize code.
<ljharb>	!nouns @ Nazral
<ecmabot>	Nazral: In JavaScript, verbs are equally important as nouns. http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html
<Nazral>	Ok
<Nazral>	I'll do that
<Nazral>	I'm not a big fan of oo anyway
<Nazral>	but it still doesn't answer my question
<ljharb>	that is true :-)
<Bauer2>	guys, how do I urlencode a password sent in a POST form? which may contain chars such as ~!@#$&*()=:/,;?+'
<ljharb>	Nazral: so with rAF, you need to request a new frame every time
<ljharb>	Bauer2: the browser does that automatically for you.
<Nazral>	ljharb: that I do
<ljharb>	not in that pastebin
<ljharb>	it's only once, in that iife
<Nazral>	what about the function borderAnim()
<Nazral>	and line 62 ?
<ljharb>	line 64 only executes once
<ljharb>	also you're still using setInterval
<Nazral>	yes but later
<Nazral>	but the border animation does work
<Nazral>	it just doesn't stop running
<H3>	ljharb: do you have min?
<Bauer2>	ljharb: if so, how do you explain that in server side php, $_POST["txtLoginServicePassword"] is equal to something like 'E1111+*', while urldecode($_POST["txtLoginServicePassword"]) is equal to 'E1111 *'
<Bauer2>	the + was lost
<DragonPunch>	okay
<DragonPunch>	whats wrong with this
<DragonPunch>	http://hastebin.com/lomejeloru.1c
<DragonPunch>	its just a bunch of ||
<DragonPunch>	it's not detecting the or as true
<DragonPunch>	it keeps detecing as false
<ljharb>	Bauer2: why are you urldecoding it?
<ljharb>	DragonPunch: that syntax doesn't do what you think it does.
<ljharb>	DragonPunch: you can't compare to multiple things at once like that.
<Bauer2>	ljharb: I always have done so, but until now user passwords did not include characters such as +
<ljharb>	DragonPunch: everything on the right of the == turns into one single value, "tiff". and then is compared.
<ljharb>	Bauer2: why would you need to tho?
<ljharb>	Bauer2: POST vars aren't in a URL, so they aren't URL encoded.
<ljharb>	Bauer2: only GET vars are.
<Bauer2>	ljharb: if it comes url encoded, I need to decode it, no?
<DragonPunch>	ljharb: well that's a bummer. what is the 'convenient' way to do it?
<ljharb>	Bauer2: POST vars do not come url encoded.
<ljharb>	DragonPunch: make an array, and use indexOf
<ljharb>	DragonPunch: also use === and NEVER ==.
<greengriminal>	Given the following example: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a3e72366878104a3349e if i change the timeout value to 300 I get: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'hide' of undefined any particular reason why I am having to be obligated to setting the timeout to 500
<greengriminal>	I did find a SO question that stated that the setTimeout doe not start instantly, and that when calling setTimeout it just puts the function in a queue
<Nazral>	ljharb: what am I supposed to do ? to put a while loop somewhere ?
<ljharb>	greengriminal: yes, that's right. you also have unnecessary parens around the function passed into setTimeout, but that doesn't break anything.
<ljharb>	greengriminal: if you're using jquery, why are you listening to DOMContentLoaded?
<Nazral>	while(this.on) { (innerLoop() { requestAnimationFrame(innerloop); render(); })(); }
<ljharb>	greengriminal: use $(document).ready
<ljharb>	Nazral: no, ew, no loops anywhere
<Bauer2>	ljharb: I think you are right, I no longer need to do urldecode...
<ljharb>	Nazral: requestAnimationFrame(frameCallback), and in frameCallback, you rAF again.
<Bauer2>	perhaps once, long time ago..
<ljharb>	Bauer2: you never did in the first place.
<Nazral>	ljharb: which is exactly what I do !
<ljharb>	Nazral: no, you don't
<ljharb>	Nazral: the word "requestAnimationFrame" only appears once in your code
<greengriminal>	ljharb, I am not using jQuery I am using prototype
<ljharb>	and it's not inside any code that repeats
<ljharb>	greengriminal: oh, ew, why
<Nazral>	ljharb: it's inside the function borderLoop
<Nazral>	which call it
<DragonPunch>	ljharb: if (filedata.extension.indexOf("tiff") != null) {..} ??
<H3>	please, how do i set ”var latlng” to response.loc from the $.get ?
<H3>	http://jsfiddle.net/dgufeyjd/
<greengriminal>	in this particular layout I don't have access to jQuery
<Havvy>	Isn't prototype the library that mutates all the base object prototypes?
<ljharb>	DragonPunch: as long as filedata.extension is an array, and also, !== -1
<Nazral>	 http://pastebin.com/8C1QkHhm <= line 62 / 64
<ljharb>	DragonPunch: again don't use != or ==.
<greengriminal>	but yest ljharb if i did have access to jQuery then i would of stuck the function inside $(document).ready({});
<Nazral>	plus otherwise why would the animation work ?
<Nazral>	how
<ljharb>	Nazral: the rAF call is not inside borderAnim.
<DragonPunch>	ljhrab: ok thsnkx
<ljharb>	Nazral: borderAnim ends on line 58.
<Nazral>	so ?
<Nazral>	It's in borderloop
<ljharb>	Nazral: and borderloop is NEVER CALLED except once
<greengriminal>	think I'm screwed. But if the setTimeout puts the function in the queue it possible to give my function a 'higher order' so that is executed first?
<ljharb>	Nazral: it's an IIFE. an immediately invoked function. which means it's called *once*
<ljharb>	greengriminal: no, you can't do that.
<Nazral>	but borderloop call itself thourhgt rAF
<greengriminal>	I was just dreaming :(
<greengriminal>	dreams shattered lol
<ljharb>	Nazral: ahhh right sorry i misread it.
<ljharb>	Nazral: ok so you're still using "this.on"
<ljharb>	Nazral: if you want "this" to keep working, you have to bind it to the callback that's passed into rAF.
<Nazral>	well, in the meantime, I'll refactor my code
<ljharb>	Nazral: hence, why i keep telling you not to use "this"
<ljharb>	your problems will just evaporate away the more of it you remove :-)
<Nazral>	you mean like requestAnimationFrame(borderloop.bind(this)) ?
<ljharb>	otherwise you'd need to preserve the "this" in a few places inside and outside borderloop
<ljharb>	yes
<ljharb>	also bBorderAnim.call(this)
<Nazral>	it doesn't work :(
<Nazral>	ok
<ljharb>	also the iife needs to .call(this) too.
<ljharb>	it's just really messy.
<Nazral>	bBorderAnim is bound to this
<ljharb>	oh right sorry
<ljharb>	hmm
<ljharb>	Nazral: and what sets "this.on" to false?
<DragonPunch>	ljharb: I tried running this and it's not working as intended, any clues? http://hastebin.com/ugedobufus.avrasm
<ljharb>	DragonPunch: what's "not working" mean? also, don't use substr, use slice
<Nazral>	ljharb: http://pastebin.com/AjbmhTg0 line 193
<ljharb>	Nazral: you're mixing setInterval, setTimeout, and rAF. you should have just rAF, and nothing else.
<ljharb>	Nazral: but at this point you'll need to make a jsfiddle, not a pastebin
<DragonPunch>	ljharb: Well, I do not know. Since it's not giving me an error, all I know is that it's not letting my route continue to a response.
<ljharb>	DragonPunch: so use the debugger, or console.log some stuff, and see what's going on
<DragonPunch>	ljharb: alright
<DragonPunch>	ljharb: lets c

*	TheGayPrisonRapi is now known as BernieMadoff
<BernieMadoff>	apologies if the thing i'm about to ask is a bit newbieish, but could i ask the exact version of jav.s. when the gettrs/settrs were supported?
<DragonPunch>	ljharb: im trying to log it but my console is just giving me a 500 err
<ljharb>	BernieMadoff: that's in ES5, which was published in 2011.

<mramaizng>	Hey friends. I’m having a dog of a time getting svg patterns to work with javscript and my dynamic svg
<mramaizng>	I render the svg and it shows up fine
<sweb>	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29961992/javascript-intl-datetimeformatter-as-iso-8601-output-pattern
<mramaizng>	but the patterns dont show up
<BernieMadoff>	ljharb, so it'd be non-statndard to use it in a <1.4 code?
<ljharb>	BernieMadoff: because properties are properties and functions are functions. treating properties like functions makes code harder to reason about.
<ljharb>	BernieMadoff: what's "1.4"?
<ljharb>	BernieMadoff: you might be referring to mozilla's javascript versions, but that's not standard javascript.
<ljharb>	BernieMadoff: IE 8 is an ES3 browser for example, and it can't have getters and setters.
<BernieMadoff>	ljharb, that is an answer to my stupid questions. thanks; as an aside, my intentions to use properties has been a harmless one, if not justified; i intended to implement static members
<H3>	How do I set the geocode from the response.loc: ($("#details").html("Location: " + response.loc);)

<BernieMadoff>	ljharb, you're right; still, i find no other way than using them to implement "static" (that is, "type-wide") members;it's not a necessity but i'm really wondering if it could be done in the language
<ljharb>	BernieMadoff: it's best to avoid inheritance anyways.
<ljharb>	BernieMadoff: JS doesn't have types. or classes.
<H3>	am i muted or smoething?
<H3>	something*
<ljharb>	H3: no, someone will answer if they know. you just have to wait.
<H3>	ohh okay, sorry
<BernieMadoff>	ljharb, i'm trying to build a language of my own; that's why i'm asking :)
*	BernieMadoff is being absolutely serious
<ljharb>	BernieMadoff: in that case, JS' semantics don't really matter, since you can write your own
<Nazral>	ljharb: https://jsfiddle.net/pkfkmL33/ there
<ljharb>	BernieMadoff: but if i were you, i'd try to learn a lot more about type theory and PL theory before trying to write your own language. i don't know nearly enough for that by half :-)
<ljharb>	Nazral: syntax error
<ljharb>	Nazral: you have a bunch of random Â chars in there
<ljharb>	(check the JS console)
<Nazral>	https://jsfiddle.net/pkfkmL33/5/
<Nazral>	my bad I didn't save the last modifications
<Nazral>	so here it is
<ljharb>	ok so what's it supposed to do that it's not doing
<BernieMadoff>	and by the word "static", i mean: function T() {this.m="instance";}; T.staticVar = "typewide"; /* prop mojo */ T.prototyp.__definegettr__("staticVar", function(){return T.staticVar;}); ...defineSettr("staticVar",function (t){T.staticVar=t;})
<ljharb>	yes i know what you mean
<Nazral>	https://jsfiddle.net/pkfkmL33/7/ <= there, the setTimeout at the very end should stop, after three seconds, the border animation on the top left corner cell
<ljharb>	you don't need getters or setters for that tho.
<ljharb>	BernieMadoff: note that "static" is different than "shared by all instances" in JS.
<ljharb>	BernieMadoff: `T.prototype.shared = 'something'` might be what you're thinking of
*	ljharb BernieMadoff: also, never use __defineGetter__ or anything with "__"
<ljharb>	use Object.defineProperty.
<BernieMadoff>	ljharb, no; my intention is having it such that assigning to new T().staticVar has the exact effect as assigning to has the exact effect of assigning to T.staticVar
<BernieMadoff>	(and the fact that the __ thing is not standard was what brought me on this channel :)
<ljharb>	BernieMadoff: why would you want that exactly?
<ljharb>	BernieMadoff: also why not just have a "setT" method, and have that store it somewhere shared?
<BernieMadoff>	ljharb, it's a long thing :) should i tell all on channel, or through private messaging?
<ljharb>	try to tell it short on the channel :-)
<ljharb>	if you can't describe it briefly, it's too complex to build anyways
*	brendanpuck is now known as Guest71739
<BernieMadoff>	ljharb, thanks; in short, i want to get py class member semantics on jav.s.
<ljharb>	please don't abbreviate it like that, it's "js" or "javascript"
<ljharb>	also why? if you want that, just write python and transpile it to javascript.
*	BernieMadoff blushes
<ljharb>	if you want to write JS, it's best to forget about your pet language, and learn JS itself.
<BernieMadoff>	it is a thrill-seeking experience for me; i'm just trying to reinvent the wheel to test my skill to their highest limit
<ljharb>	i'm not sure that's really testing much skill, nor the highest limit
<Johnade>	hi everyone :)
*	BernieMadoff feels even more stupid
<ljharb>	but JS can't behave like python, unless you write an entirely new language runtime inside JS
<Johnade>	comingsoontm: hello ;)
<ljharb>	and if you want to write an entirely new language runtime inside JS, that's the sort of thing people do as their graduate school thesis projects
<ljharb>	ie, not an easy task
<BernieMadoff>	ljharb, i've already done a full "yield" in my language; the static thing was goin to be the icing :)
<ljharb>	that runs in JS?
<ljharb>	or compiles to it
<BernieMadoff>	yes
<BernieMadoff>	no runtime or thing
<ljharb>	so if it's your own language, you can make the JS behind it do anything.
<BernieMadoff>	i'm going to do some cleaning on my code and put it on githb
<BernieMadoff>	*u
<ljharb>	but if it's just JS, then it's not your own language, it's JS, and it can't possibly have python's (or any other languages') semantics.
<ljharb>	essentially that'd be like going to england and trying to get people to drive on the right side of the road
<ljharb>	it's a totally fine way to drive, as is "on the left", but it makes no sense in the wrong country
<BernieMadoff>	ljharb, pardon my impertinence/carelessness; i actually meant i've compiled the yield in my language to equivalent js code
<ljharb>	ok
<ljharb>	so, JS is turing complete, you can compile whatever you want
<willv2>	totally fine as in 'the right way is on the left' yeah ljharb?
<ljharb>	willv2: no, then the driver is positioned closest to the sidewalk, instead of the oncoming traffic.
<BernieMadoff>	god love you, that is the spot
<willv2>	ljharb: They do switch the driver seat you know
<willv2>	anyway I was just being silly
<ljharb>	willv2: oh yeah you're right :-p ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<willv2>	ljharb: Out fo curiousity in school were you told you stay on the right or the left of the corridor?
<ljharb>	right
<willv2>	ahah, so it was from the roads that they picked the left
<ljharb>	when there's two directions in the US, you always stick to the right
<ljharb>	i'm in the US.
<willv2>	Opposite here
<willv2>	in the UK
<ljharb>	i don't actually know the origin of the difference
<willv2>	ljharb: Do you put commas at the start of lines? :)
<ljharb>	http://www.worldstandards.eu/cars/driving-on-the-left/ suggests it's because your right hand is your sword hand
<BernieMadoff>	there is actually a joke a persian friend of mine told me about the situation: a turk man is driving on the wrong side of the road; "your attention please," he hears the radio man say, "a dumb idiot is driving on the wrong side of M38." he looks through the windshield and say "all of these drivers are dumb idiots, then"
<ljharb>	so in an ancient, obsolete british feudal society, you'd be writing your horse with your sword, and naturally cars go that way too
<ljharb>	willv2: no, gross. comma last or gtfo.
<BernieMadoff>	*says
<rmorrin>	Is there some better/more efficient way of achieving this? http://jsfiddle.net/37h3pgbm/ I want to select everything under div.foo but not div.foo.bar
<willv2>	ljharb: Ahah! So coding style transcends countries borders. But to be fair jousting was probably a lot fo fun in cars when they went really slow.
<ljharb>	probably not, a joust probably broke an older engine
<ljharb>	rmorrin: $('.foo:not(.bar) p') but it's equally efficient.
<ljharb>	rmorrin: also, ask that in #jquery.
<willv2>	rmorrin: Semantically you'd usually override the rule on the more specific classes. i.e. .foo p {color: red;}, .foo.bar p {color:black;}
<willv2>	but depending on if you nto actually changing css there that might not be relevent
<rmorrin>	willv2: I understand, I was just using the colours as a way of visually representing the elements, in my real use case I don't need to style them
<willv2>	Yeah I suspected that. Of course if you can, having more semantic classes would be ideal
<ljharb>	like .foo.bar and .foo.notbar
<ljharb>	but better named
<rmorrin>	Perhaps if I try to explain the problem a little clearer. I need to process a bunch of dom elements when the page first loads, but they can also be added to the page after the fact (infinite load). I've used mutation observers to detect the new DOM elements being added to the page, but I need some way of processing just the new elements.
<rmorrin>	adding a css class to the wrapper of the ones already done seemed like an easy way to achieve that.
<ljharb>	you don't want that.
<ljharb>	rmorrin: use event delegation if you want behavior on the new elements
<ljharb>	and if you want to change them, then, that's all wrong - hook into whatever mechanism is adding them
<ljharb>	either with events, or a callback, or something.
<ljharb>	needing mutation observers is usually a smell.
<rmorrin>	ljharb: I don't have access to the code adding them unfortunately.
<ljharb>	rmorrin: and you need to modify the elements as they
<ljharb>	as they're added?
<rmorrin>	ljharb: could you point me to an example of using event delegation?
<ljharb>	$container.on(event, '.child.selector', handler)
<ljharb>	done
<ljharb>	jquery makes it easy.
<kakashiAL>	if you look at the http-hader if you use a token, you have something like:
<kakashiAL>	Authorization: Bearer AkjJHDFH_YOUR_TOKEN
<kakashiAL>	I have just one question, why is there always Bearer, I dont see a reason why you need it
<kakashiAL>	Authorization: AkjJHDFH_YOUR_TOKEN  <---why is this not enought
<ljharb>	my guess is that there's other kinds than "bearer"?
<ljharb>	like "basic" etc
<ljharb>	and you have to tell the server what kind it is.
<kakashiAL>	ljharb: hmm, but is the token not enough to do any kind of logic
<ljharb>	i don't see how it could be
<ljharb>	what about the token makes it not able to be a basic password?
<kakashiAL>	ahh you mean something like "if its basic, use this logic/server/algorithm, if its bearer use this logic/server/algorithm"
<kakashiAL>	thanks ljharb, makes sense now :)
<DragonPunch>	anyone wna tto 'refer' me to amazon s3 ?? for rewarsd. im about to sign up and spend money.

<cool_boy>	ankr: I can try, but how about models['res.partner'].fields.push('street2'); ? are they same?
<ankr>	cool_boy no, you would need to loop the models array to find the one with the "model" property equal to "res.partner"
<ankr>	cool_boy a generic solution that will find all models with name of "res.partner" would be something like
<ankr>	models.filter(function (m) { return m.model === 'res.partner'; }).map(function (m) { return m.fields.push('street2'), m; });

<Gisleh>	Hey. I can't update the content of the bootstrap side menu with ajax even if the same ajax call work virtually anywhere else.

Neither work when the navbar portion of the page is rewritten using ajax and $('navbarcontent').html() with the results, which does update
<Gisleh>	the top portion of the navbar despite it being within the same div as the sidemen. Anyone done this before? Updated the side menu with ajax?

<Creeves>	does anyone have any opinions on parasitic distributed computing (using javascript)? as opposed to volunteer computing
<Creeves>	mainly regarding ethical implications
<yoshokatana>	Creeves you mean, like, using bot networks to do stuff?
<yoshokatana>	uhh...don't do that. it's not nice.
<deepy>	Creeves: I tried it and the performance is so bad and it tends to be very noticable
<Creeves>	kind of but not specifically
<deepy>	You've got nothing to win, but everything to lose
<Creeves>	what i mean is like what crowdprocess.com does
<Creeves>	the equivalent to volunteer computing
<yoshokatana>	I mean, the closest thing you could get to that (while still being on the lighter-grey part of the ethics spectrum) would be some sort of opt-out system (with a warning, and easy opt-out, etc)
<Creeves>	but using background processes in the browser to make some calculations as a node on a grid
<Creeves>	yosafbridge: that's a really good point actually
<deepy>	Creeves: the performance is terrible and the page tends to crap itself
<xqo>	can event handlers return values?
<xqo>	specifically the onload handler for FileReader, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader
<Creeves>	deepy: what if you were able to gain enough knowledge about the available resources a user has before giving that user the distributed workload, ensuring that their background processing doesn't affect their user experience on the site that it's taking place on
<cjohnson>	you can return but the value is discarded xqo
<cjohnson>	why do you want to return a value? what are you trying to do?
<deepy>	Creeves: do you remember the part where I said performance is terrible?
<xqo>	cjohnson let me try to make a fiddle example
<Creeves>	deepy: but wouldn't that be specific to how you implement the background processing?
<deepy>	Creeves: you're going to be wasting CPU cycles, it'd be cheaper to run it on the server
<cjohnson>	Creeves: you wouldn't have to, since that user is volunteering their system to be used for you, they could also choose to take on the burden of ensuring adequate resources
<cjohnson>	if you're talking about a setup where hte user isn't volunteering their system for your use, then you need to take it to another channel, because that kind of thing isn't tolerated here
<Creeves>	i'm wanting to discuss the ethics of doing that cjohnson
<Creeves>	like
<cjohnson>	the ethics are pretty clear. If they opt in, you're fine. If they don't explicitly opt in, then it's bad
<Creeves>	in the papers ive read, people liken it to a website running analytics in the background or doing other processing that doesn't specifically help the user experience
<cjohnson>	in either case, performance wouldn't be great. you'd be better off distributing a standalone client like folding@home
<erste>	anyone used the IONIC framework?? what do you think about it's Grid system??
<deepy>	Creeves: in some places doing that is actually legally tricky
<deepy>	I don't remember where, but if you did it without the users permission then they legally owned the data you generated in their browser
<Creeves>	cjohnson: part of what i'm wanting to do is design a proof of concept framework for native, in-browser GPGPU processing
<Creeves>	and am thinking about the ethics of it being parasitic or volunteer
<cjohnson>	distributing that woark over the internet would be pointless
<cjohnson>	if you're talking about implementing graphics processing for the user's application that's one thing
<cjohnson>	but if you're talking about distributing that workload, withour the user's permission, that's a: very pointless, since the network is thousands of times slower than the GPU, and B: ethically bad
<Creeves>	cjohnson: overcomming the bottleneck of data transfer is part of what i'm looking to do research in
<Creeves>	but ethically i'm just here to find opinions, i don't disagree
<Creeves>	there's definitely strong arguments that it's unethical
<cjohnson>	you can't overcome the network being much much slower than the GPU
<samssh>	"What is the answer to life, the universe, and everything" transmitted, "42" returned. Huge computations between.
<cjohnson>	the logical next step is the CPU, not the netwrok
<cjohnson>	so you would offload a user's own GPU processing to that user's own CPU
<cjohnson>	which isn't what you're talking about with the distributed parasitic stuff
<Creeves>	no not really
<Creeves>	a good indication of what i want to do is implement what this site has: https://crowdprocess.com/ but using GPGPU processing in the browser rather than web workers
<cjohnson>	right, which isn't really applicable, as I just explained
<Creeves>	like i said though, i think the idea of parasitic javascript is pretty unethical, and i noticed that site doesn't call it 'parasitic' anywhere i can see, likely because they're on thin ice ethically
<xqo>	cjohnson i want the ArrayBuffer that is read on line 10 to be set as an attribute of JPEG, and then I want JPEG to return itself with the arraybuffer attached http://jsfiddle.net/cb9vob85/2/
<cjohnson>	the network is too slow to be timely enough to offset GPU processing
<cjohnson>	that website is opt in. it's not parasitic
<Creeves>	cjohnson: i don't think it is parasitic
<bros>	Is forEach known to be consistently slightly slower than for?
<Creeves>	sorry
<Creeves>	i don't think it's opt in
<cjohnson>	bros: no, and don't worry about performance at that level
<cjohnson>	Creeves: yes it is. You have to explicltly volunteer your website for use
<Creeves>	if you sign up to that crowdprocess website as an owner of a site, they give you some code that you chuck on your site, and users who visit your site become a node in their grid
<cjohnson>	and then it's up to you to ensure that your users are opting in
<cjohnson>	and are informed
<Creeves>	ah i see what you mean
<Creeves>	i feel like that's kind of passing the buck then i guess
<Creeves>	becuase i only want to do the same thing, that is, design the platform that will allow what that crowdprocess website is doing
<cjohnson>	well, who else can make sure your users are opting in to your service beside you?
<cjohnson>	the buck was always and only in your plate to begin with, imo
<Creeves>	yeah true
<bendman>	anybody know how to get the raw content of a node, without encoding or decoding any of the entities?
<bros>	cjohnson, jsperf says 77% slower?
<Creeves>	but in that case, what i'm trying to do isn't really unethical
<cjohnson>	ok I see what you're getting at. I still think it's a waste of time because the network is so incredibly slower than the GPU
<Creeves>	as i said, it's pretty much exactly what that site does, except utilizing the GPU
<cjohnson>	the whole thing with the website you linked is that the data doesn't need to be returned ina  timely fashion
<Creeves>	but yeah that is good information for me, regarding the bottleneck of the network
<Creeves>	thatnks for that
<bendman>	innerHTML converts < characters to &lt; for example, and textContent removes any tags
<cjohnson>	bros: irrelevant micro benchmarks are irrelevant
<cjohnson>	bros: if you are concerned with performance, write your app, and then use a profiler
<cjohnson>	there is no other useful performan test, because the JS engine does so much contextual work for you
<cjohnson>	it's very smart
<Creeves>	surely there could be applications where the size of the input/output is small but the work required to be done on it is comparably large
<Creeves>	and this would be suitable for that
<cjohnson>	Creeves: but still, you're talking about offsetting GPU work, which generally has to be real-time right
<cjohnson>	which rules out the network
<xqo>	Is there some way for event handlers to return values? my fiddle fails on line 21 http://jsfiddle.net/cb9vob85/4/
<cjohnson>	xqo JPEG isn't an event handler. I don't see where you're trying to return a value in an event handler?
<xqo>	cjohnson line 7
<Creeves>	i'm not sure i understand what you mean by offsetting here, i'm still early in learning how distributed computing works
<samssh>	An obvious, if potentially illigal example of low input and output, high processing, non-realtime necessary computing is bruteforcing hashes.
<Creeves>	in my mind it doesn't have to be real time, it's simply performing the calculations that a web worker would do but faster
*	Cyndre is now known as Guest85394
<cjohnson>	xqo: I am confused what you're trying to do. why do you need to return self? you already have access to self
<Creeves>	unless you mean real time as an input of size n calculated on a GPU with > n cores would complete the input in o(1) (assumming these bounds are met)
<cjohnson>	just remove line 7
<cjohnson>	line 6 sets "this".byteArray = reader.result;
<cjohnson>	where "this" is the instance of JPEG
<xqo>	cjohnson it is useful for my real code, and cleaner than chaining a bunch of event handlers. I will use the returned JPEG in another script
<cjohnson>	you *already* have access to it
<cjohnson>	via this.byteArray
<cjohnson>	or line 20, IMG.byteArray. except you have to wait until the async callback has completed
<xqo>	cjohnson yes, thats why i want to wait. I dont want JPEG to return itself before the async callback has completed
<cjohnson>	right. You can't use return here if that's what you want
<cjohnson>	you'll have to change JPEG to use a callback
<cjohnson>	or be a promise
<xqo>	what is a promise?
<cjohnson>	!promise
<cjohnson>	!promises
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: Promises are placeholders for values that are not yet available, and allow one to regain compositionality for asynchronous operations in JavaScript. See: https://gist.github.com/domenic/3889970, https://blog.jcoglan.com/?p=1609 (contrast with !cps)
<cjohnson>	ES6 introduces them, but you can use them today with
<cjohnson>	!es6-shim
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: Use https://www.npmjs.com/package/es6-shim to get every backwards-compatible feature of ES6 in every browser and node.js! It's heavily tested, comes with Promises, and requires the !es5-shim.
<xqo>	ok, thank you.
<WajidKagzi>	what REPL do you peeps use for JS?
<cjohnson>	you asked this yesterday, the answer is npm
<cjohnson>	and then browserify to get modules into the browser
<cjohnson>	:P
<WajidKagzi>	what about Rhino?
<cjohnson>	that...is something else
<WajidKagzi>	mah bad cjohnson, thanks
<cjohnson>	Rhino is an open-source implementation of JavaScript written entirely in Java. It is typically embedded into Java applications to provide scripting to end users. It is embedded in J2SE 6 as the default Java scripting engine.
<samssh>	cjohnson, Did you mean node.js rather than npm?
<cjohnson>	no
<cyberbrai>	hot use a remove function in javascript
<cjohnson>	cyberbrai: ?
<samssh>	NPM is a package manager... Are we speaking of a Read-Eval-Print-Loop?
<cyberbrai>	cjohnson yes
<cjohnson>	maybe I'm confused. I thought REPL was a repository for packages. I seem to remember that being in the perl world
<cjohnson>	if that's the case then yeah I would say node or io.js are good interpreters
<cjohnson>	for doing that
<cyberbrai>	like in jquery if i wannt to remove then  $("#"+s).remove();
<cjohnson>	what about it cyberbrai
<cjohnson>	what is your question
<samssh>	WajidKagzi, What were you asking for? A repository, or Read-Eval-Print-Loop?
<WajidKagzi>	the latter
<cjohnson>	oh sorry for my confusion WajidKagzi
<samssh>	Yeah, Node.js is what you want.
<cyberbrai>	i want to remove the tr from tbody on the basis of id
<cjohnson>	node.js or io.js (which is a fork of node)
<cjohnson>	cyberbrai: you have the right syntax
<cjohnson>	$('#theid').remove()
<cyberbrai>	in js
<cjohnson>	jquery is JS
<cyberbrai>	not in jquery
<WajidKagzi>	but in node.js one cannot type muliple lines for functions
<cjohnson>	but removeChild is how you remove elements in vanilla JS
<cjohnson>	WajidKagzi: well, you would be writing your functions in an editor

<WajidKagzi>	thanks peeps, sorry for the repeat question

<samssh>	cjohnson, +1
<cjohnson>	javascript014: console.log(data); to see what it is
<greves>	Anyone used baobab?
<khmer>	all right everyone
<khmer>	nobody panic
<javascript014>	cjohnson: undefined
<khmer>	i've started rotating my right monitor 90º again
<cjohnson>	if it's undefined then it's because the triggering function didn't pass a second argument
<cjohnson>	so of course that's why it'd be undefined
<samssh>	khmer, I have Hexchat in a vertical monitor.
<javascript014>	cjohnson: look at an official example : http://www.jstree.com/docs/events/     my code is quasi-the same ^
<zap0>	khmer, welcome to the 90° club
<javascript014>	cjohnson: so perhasps i have not the same version of jstree
<cjohnson>	well, I dunno what to tell you javascript014, but if "data" is undefined then their code is not passing a second argument
<samssh>	If you're cold, just sit closer. Your monitor is 90°.
<javascript014>	cjohnson:  okay:p
<javascript014>	cjohnson: tx !! :)
<athan>	So react.js is something like a way to bind DOM nodes together? The virtual components / properties & states system seems really cool
<cjohnson>	javascript014: try console.log(arguments);
<cjohnson>	maybe the second arg is intentionalyl undefined and there's some other data being passed as the third/fourth arg?
<athan>	does this make it agnostic for things like foundation, bootstrap, etc?
<Creeves>	cjohnson: thanks again about that info on the ethical implications of creating a platform for what i want to do and how it should be up to the websites hosting the code to make users opt in
<Creeves>	going to use that exact argument in my paper
<cjohnson>	np
<HoloIRCUser3>	90 is almost boiling are u trying to kill the man?
<cjohnson>	athan: it's virtual dom + diffing to save on performance, as a means of updating the DOM when data changes
<samssh>	HoloIRCUser3, I said closer, not touching. Besides, I was thinking Fahrenheit.
<khmer>	zap0: in a way i never left
<cjohnson>	it uses a different approach than templating or direct node updating, since you can have a naieve understanding of the layout but still performantly only change the DOM nodes whose data has changed
<athan>	cjohnson: okay that seems pretty simple
<athan>	oh wow
<zap0>	khmer, i don't use left as much either, not that right is 90°  ;)
<zap0>	now that/
<khmer>	zap0: i'm aware that the viewing angle isn't optimal for this
<cyberbrai>	   	  $("#sort").append("<li id="+Id+"> <input id="reverse" type=checkbox > "+userName+"</li>");  is it a right way to append the li
<khmer>	i'm aware that the color profile is different
<khmer>	everyone do their breathing exercises
<HoloIRCUser3>	Fahrenheit? that's so complicated  don't even know if there's enough programers in the world to convert that to a real unit

<javascript014>	ankr: gwe
<ankr>	likewise!
<cjohnson>	Creeves: oh I see. I thought you were saying that double quotes were more compliant. technically I think attrs should have quotes but no browser anywhere actually enforces that
<Creeves>	ah okay, nah i just have a thing for attrs having double quotes
<Creeves>	it just seems... right
<cjohnson>	I usually prefer single quotes to doubles but for HTML I actually agree -- only because for instance title="It's a me, Mario!"
<cjohnson>	I tend to use apostrophes in normal writing more than double quotes
<Creeves>	yeah for all other strings i prefer ' over " when available
<Creeves>	i mean
<Creeves>	it's a shift-less to type
<Creeves>	i think when i first learned HTML i didn't have a concept of a string or anything and i learned that it was <element attr="value"> and bore that into my brain

<delboy1978uk>	this is either a css or a javascript issue, but my bootstrap tabs (from a theme template i am tweaking for someone) seem to be screwed up, try clicking different tabs and you’ll see what i mean. can anyone help? http://lab.delboysplace.co.uk/agent-details.php
<delboy1978uk>	ive never had a girlfriend who was impressed by my javascript :’(
<alexcf>	aww
<delboy1978uk>	she was impressed by the money it earned me though :-)
<WajidKagzi>	ahahah
<delboy1978uk>	anyway can anyone help? i have bootstrap tabbed content, but each tab seems to start after the last div further down the page!
<natmyers>	WajidKagzi: you could try using canvas
<delboy1978uk>	the weirdest thing is the first tab is active but you cant see it till you click another tab then click on the first tab again!
<WajidKagzi>	could you elaborate natmyers?

<ankr>	WajidKagzi http://www.craftymind.com/factory/html5video/CanvasVideo.html
<L8D>	SVG would work too
<natmyers>	it's pretty good for manipulating images and animation
<L8D>	That reminds me, how come so many people jump straight to using canvases before even considering SVG?
<L8D>	When 90% of the time SVG is better and faster
<ankr>	L8D less math
<natmyers>	ha, I just like openGL
<WajidKagzi>	thanks guys
<WajidKagzi>	you guys know a lot
<L8D>	Yeah, SVG for 2D stuff and openGL for the 3D stuff
<L8D>	ankr: I feel like I've still do a lot of math when working with canvas
<L8D>	but when it comes to scaling SVG things I can always resort to D3
<L8D>	the most complicated part of SVG is the 'd' attribute in paths
<natmyers>	the only advantage I can see for openGL is you can use the display matrix to automatically split an image into parts
<natmyers>	but yeah, svg is simpler
<code_pod>	I have a parallax web page that has a button that loads next project showcase. Upon clicking that button I wanna 1) load next project images and put them in right places(In order to accomplish this I use document.getElementById("someId").src = "some image") 2) Change the animation such as fading(I use Animation.css)
<code_pod>	In my javascript file I have a global variable that contains a string that represent current project name
<code_pod>	And I have a function called loadNextProject() that get called when clicking said button
<code_pod>	Inside the function I use if/else if on current project name and based on that I load images and change .src of each img
<L8D>	code_pod: perhaps you should consider using a framework
<code_pod>	It's not a good solution since it doesn't work 'cause if we have lots of project handling these project just using an if/else if is not rational

<dolphinling>	Hi. IE (all versions) has a bug with <base> where if you set window.location = "a/relative/url/", <base> doesn't get applied. Is there some way I can feature detect for this bug, or should I give in and use browser detection?
<ankr>	dolphinlingp sounds like browser detection to me, or ducktyping
<cresten>	dolphinling: http://modernizr.com/
<code_pod>	natmyers: Well, no, that's another question that I'll ask. I have lots of projects that I wanna showcase in my web page. So I have a button that upon clicking it it needs to load next project. In order to do that I use a function that get each element that I'm interested in and change the image of it. I have a global variable that contains current project name and I use an if/else if statement to load said images and project but I believe that it's
<code_pod>	 not rational since if I have dozens of projects the if/else if becomes really big and ugly.
<dolphinling>	cresten: How is modernizr going to help?
<cresten>	dolphinling: haha I just saw feature detection and that's what leapt to mind. It's a feature detection library. But yeah, it will probably not help for your use case
<cresten>	dolphinling: since you're trying to detect a bug, not a feature, probably not going to be helpful
<natmyers>	code_pod: maybe try splitting each project's logic into it's own key in a dictionary and just query that
<dolphinling>	cresten: Aah, okay, yeah I just double checked and it doesn't seem to have anything for it
<natmyers>	code_pod: like {project1: function() {do stuff}, project2: function() {do stuff}}
<code_pod>	natmyers: Ah
<natmyers>	code_pod: that'll get rid of the if / else nest

<cjohnson>	#jquery is silent on the matter, but does anybody know how I can do the following? $.ajax({url: '/foo', data: {url: 'http://someotherwebsite.com'}, method: 'get'}); ? When I pass url to data, it seems ot override the main url setting and it makes an ajax request oth ttp://someotherwebsite.com/ instead
<natmyers>	code_pod: this is where jQuery will likely come in handy. if you've never used it it'll take a bit of learning, but it will probably make what you're trying to do much easier
<delboy1978uk>	cross sub-domain is relatively easy. All you need to do is to set the document.domain to be same in both the parent page and the iframe page. document.domain = "yourdomain.com"
<STRML>	Technically you want to send `Access-Control-Expose-Headers: <header names>`, but again some browsers screw it up
<delboy1978uk>	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/648899/a-question-about-cross-domain-subdomain-ajax-request
<sonthonax>	STRML: misread that.
<STRML>	So either return the header in the actual response body, or proxy a subpath to the subdomain
<code_pod>	natmyers: Yes
<sonthonax>	I’m not having trouble sending sensitive data like my session cookie.
<cjohnson>	cyberspace009: nothing wrong with making prototype functions as long as your code understands that
<cjohnson>	in fact it would be slightly better in terms of memory usage since putting the methods on the instances themselves duplicates the method for each instance
<STRML>	cjohnson: That's really strange, try stringifying the data before sending it then?
<STRML>	`data: JSON.stringify({url: ...})`
<natmyers>	code_pod: probably use http://api.jquery.com/animate/ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15029926/jquery-changing-image-src
<cyberspace009>	cjohnson: Thank you. I feel confident now on how to apparoach my function
<code_pod>	natmyers: I'm using Animate.css https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/
<cjohnson>	STRML: I don't want to send a JSON dump, I'm trying to make it use url as a query parameter
<cjohnson>	I could build it by hand but I was hoping to have jquery do the url component escaping for me
<STRML>	sonthonax: e.g. Access-Control-Expose-Headers "content-range, content-length, accept-ranges"
<natmyers>	code_pod: cool, you can just use Jquery to apply that css then
<unigee>	Hi, I have a webpage that uses jquery .get that passes some values to another page, but when I attempt to read the values with var querystring = window.location.search, it comes up blank. Any ideas what I am doing wrong?
<code_pod>	natmyers: Yes
<STRML>	cjohnson: Ah sorry, misread that this was a get
<cyberspace009>	cjohnson: can you take a look at my java script code. I am using webGL. http://hastebin.com/orahaqopur.avrasm
<cjohnson>	what is your question cyberspace009
<cyberspace009>	is my design ok
<cjohnson>	hard to say without context. ok for what?
<cyberspace009>	memory wise
<cjohnson>	use a profiler
<cjohnson>	you tell me :P
<cjohnson>	chrome has one built in
<cyberspace009>	ok
<sonthonax>	Hey hey, fixed that problem. Thankfully I do have control over the server source code too.
<STRML>	sonthonax: Yeah, if you didn't, you'd have to proxy at a subresource
<Creeves>	unigee: got some code for context??
<Creeves>	oops two question marks
<STRML>	Which is not the worst
<Creeves>	i'm not sure what you mean by "passes some values to another page"
<xqo>	what is the bitwise operation called that makes 0xFFD8 become 0xD8FF?
<sonthonax>	STRML: is the Access-Control-Expose-Headers there to prevent XSS?
<STRML>	sonthonax: It's just to keep the same mechanics pre-CORS
<sonthonax>	Ah.
<STRML>	CORS is built to be an extension only and not to modify any existing behavior
<Creeves>	unigee: the way to access the values (data?) that .get() would pass would be through the callback function that's one of it's arguments
<sonthonax>	STRML: didn’t people just proxy back then?
<STRML>	sonthonax: Yep
<sonthonax>	So was CORS not allowed because of XSS?
<sonthonax>	Not allowing it seems like an arbitary restriction.
<STRML>	not allowed because of the security ramifications; imagine if a site could fire off requests to your bank website at will and read the response contents
<sonthonax>	Of course.
<unigee>	Creeves: I am just trimming my code so I can pastebin it
<STRML>	of course, to a certain degree this can happen (CSRF) which is why even /logout should be csrf token protected
<Creeves>	unigee: cool okay
<unigee>	Creeves: I hope this makes sense http://pastebin.com/7S7Rmn9a
<unigee>	rubbish
<wiherek>	hi
<silverdust>	I need someone to make this clearer to me http://www.paulirish.com/2011/surefire-dom-element-insertion/
<wiherek>	when an event is triggerred, are the eventListeners executed synchronously?
<silverdust>	Where exactly is my new created elment added to?
<wiherek>	i.e. will they fire before the next line after the event emit is evaluated?
<silverdust>	If I have var ref = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
<silverdust>	ref.parentNode should be body as my first script is in body making body the parent node
<silverdust>	Then insertBefore body means I'll have the new script between <head> and <body> ?
*	Atomic is now known as Creeves
<Creeves>	unigee: sorry i disconnected, having a look now
<yansanmo>	silverdust, ?
<unigee>	Creeves: Thanks!
<STRML>	silverdust: That's grabbing the first script on the page and inserting the element before that scrpt
<STRML>	wherever it is
<yansanmo>	if you have body.insertBefore(a, script);  then it will be :  <body><a></a><script /></body>
<Creeves>	unigee: what kind of an element is #previewFrame? an iframe?
<wiherek>	ok I will rephrase
<yansanmo>	it means: insert "a" inside the "body", but before "script"
<STRML>	it's kind of confusing syntax but foo.insertBefore(bar, baz) inserts bar before baz inside foo
<silverdust>	oh ok I now get it. Thanks for the clarification
<wiherek>	are event handlers executed immediately when an event is fired, or are they deferred?
<unigee>	Creeves: it'sa div I believe, but that doesn't matter. I need to get the values I passed inside customer.aspx
<unigee>	The current code uses asp to do it which worked OK, but I am trying to make some changes and would like to move the code to javascript
<unigee>	All I want in customer.aspx is to replace some div elements based on the url query
*	felda is now known as SteveBallmer
<unigee>	however, for some reason when I use jQuery .get, I can't seem to access thos url parameters
*	SteveBallmer is now known as felda
<unigee>	(but if I manually type in the parameters in the url bar I can)
<Creeves>	i mean using .get isn't going to change the current page's URL params
<unigee>	Creeves: oh I see
<Creeves>	all the data that customer.aspx is returning will be in that 'data' parameter int he callback function
<Creeves>	that function is going to make an http get request to your customer.aspx along with the partnumber, description etc params and their values and customer.aspx is going to return some value which will be put into the <div id="previewFrame"></div> element
<unigee>	yes thats right, but I need to use that params in customer.aspx, which in turn will return my data into 'previewFrame
<Creeves>	oh you mean that inside customer.aspx, no parameters are being passed in?
<Creeves>	i think i understand you more now
*	carlsimpson is now known as randomprogrammer
<unigee>	yea, sorry for not being too clear. I am not very familiar with HTML and javascript
<Creeves>	that's okay i'm not very familiar with aspx
<unigee>	I am trying to get rid of the asp stuff in there and just use javascript
<helloworld>	whats the best way of implementing a form validation?
<unigee>	the only thing that is stopping me is that I dont know how to get the params from inside customer.aspx file using javascript
<Creeves>	i'm still a bit confused
<natmyers>	helloworld: try https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form
<delboy1978uk>	hooray! fixed my bootstrap tab issue. turned out the guy who developed the theme is a bit of a muppet.
<asm0deus>	helloworld: leverage a framework or use regex manually
<Creeves>	you say get the params FROM inside customer.aspx
<Creeves>	are you having trouble accessing the params in aspx passed in via jQuery's .get function
<asm0deus>	anyone use velocity.js? Just trying to figure out how to rotateZ counterclockwise, it does it once then changes to clockwise
<Creeves>	or are you having trouble getting the data returned by the aspx function
<nucleartide>	ooh velocity.js
<delboy1978uk>	yuk. aspx!
<nucleartide>	i haven't used it, but i bought the book for it
<unigee>	Creeves: I am having trouble access the parmas in the aspx passed in via jQuery's .get function
<cyberspace009>	is it proper to call a function within a function? I keep imagining to make a main function in javascript and another function within that function to complete a task.
<Creeves>	hm okay
<Guest2834>	cyberspace009: yup
<Creeves>	are you running this in a browser or just unit testing?
<natmyers>	cyberspace009: that is a-okay
*	Guest2834 is now known as Torkable
<cyberspace009>	is it proper though?
<Creeves>	you could open the developer console and check the network tab
<cyberspace009>	thank god
<Creeves>	make sure that the params are formed correctly from the .get request
<natmyers>	cyberspace009: yeah it's fine
*	cyberspace009 is happy
<unigee>	Creeves: in a browser, I have no idea how to perform such a task
<Creeves>	what OS?
<Torkable>	cyberspace009: yup
<unigee>	Windows 7 using Chrome
<Creeves>	either way i guess, right click on the page and 'inspect element'
<natmyers>	cyberspace009: declaring functions in loops can get weird if you don't use proper closures but other than that, go nuts
<Creeves>	then click the 'Network' tab
<Torkable>	don't do that at all
<Creeves>	you might need to reload the page again then if your .get request runs onload

<NitroLiq>	Hi guys, can I get a little help troubleshooting an an AJAX call to multiple APIs? I've got it mostly working but where the data from each JSONP file should be showing up within three distinct <ul> tags with bucket classes, I'm getting random results as to which <ul> the data shows up in and only the data from 2 APIs are showing up at a time.
<Guest7653>	thanks again
<Creeves>	Guest7653: when googling problems in the future, usually <programming language> + <the problem> will give you some good results
<Creeves>	and no worries, happy to help :)
<NitroLiq>	I made a testcase at jsbin: http://jsbin.com/danufahuxe/1/
<NitroLiq>	If you reload the output frame, you'll see what I mean.
<Creeves>	i would help but i'm not very knowledgable on JSONP
<Creeves>	but if i had to guess looking at the code
<Creeves>	it could be something to do with the callbacks interrupting eachother and manipulating some variable in a higher scope
<Creeves>	so like
<Creeves>	you have your 'selector' variable
<Creeves>	and that success function in your .ajax call looks at that variable
<Creeves>	but that function is going to be called at some later time when the 'selector' variable has changed
<Creeves>	most likely, that .ajax function executes, then the selector variable is still set as the last one in BUCKETS (or maybe another if the first calls return fast) so that gets the data
<JoelAlejandro>	Hey there folks. Quick question - using Chromium 42 - is there any reason why --kiosk-printing renders a HTML print in a different way that a regular browser tab? There is a remarkable size difference (a ticket of 8cm width is printed 4x smaller)...
<Sorella>	ljharb: I thought you owned is-number and is-boolean besides is-string, but those packages don't seem to do what I want :(
<Creeves>	in the success callback, you can't assume the selector variable will still be set to what it was when it was set just before the .ajax function
<Creeves>	you see what i'm saying?
<NitroLiq>	kinda sorta
<natmyers>	NitroLiq: yeah, I would check out your usage of clone()
<NitroLiq>	all clone is doing is replicating the markup that gets inserted into the <ul>s
<Creeves>	NitroLiq: i suggest passing the selector to the API and returning it from the API
<Creeves>	i'm not sure it's clone() but i don't know that function well
<mbrzuzy>	What do you guys use for javascript unit testing?
<Torkable>	jasmine
<Torkable>	its ok
<natmyers>	NitroLiq: my guess is that clone is accidentally cloning already populated list items
<Torkable>	I think mocha is better
<natmyers>	NitroLiq: at least, what I'm seeing is like 8 Radiolab bumpers when I reload
<Torkable>	mocha + chai
<natmyers>	NitroLiq: maybe 25% of the time
<nucleartide>	choose mocha because tj wrote it
<NitroLiq>	I think it's just loading the APIs into randome areas.
<Torkable>	tape was mentioned yesterday but idk what tape is
<nucleartide>	it's what you use when you need to join two things together
<NitroLiq>	The APIs essentially have the same content except for the one that's supposed to appear in the read header area. Same items but only 4.
<Torkable>	(❍ᴥ❍ʋ)
<nucleartide>	haha
<nucleartide>	it's the adventure time dog
<mbrzuzy>	Thanks Torkable
<NitroLiq>	Jake
<Torkable>	lol
<Creeves>	NitroLiq: i can tell you for sure that if you're trying to use a variable that contains a selector in a callback and that variable is changing you're going to have issues
<Torkable>	everyone loves that :)
<Creeves>	that variable is going to change before that callback can run
<NitroLiq>	Hmm
<Creeves>	your server's response is not going to be faster than the time it takes js to run that .ajax call and go to the next item in BUCKETS

*	Guest7653 is now known as newbiee
<amigoo89>	hey guys silly questions, but what is happening here with my code? http://jsbin.com/fuceqaweyi/1/edit?js. When #1 OR #2 if == true, then the #3 if is also true, which doesn't make sense.
<asm0deus>	Anyone have a few minutes that could look at http://codepen.io/macsupport/pen/myrPjL and tell me how to rotate them counterclockwise instead? I tried '-360deg' instead of value for rotateZ and it does it once then goes back to clockwise for the rest of the loop.
<Torkable>	amigoo89: why does it not make sense? they are different tests...
<amigoo89>	that's exactly the point, they don't have nothing to with eachother, but if #1 or #2 is triggered the #3 is also triggered, even though the value is okay
<Torkable>	also testing for NaN seems.... bad
<Torkable>	I don't get it
<Torkable>	sounds like a correlation vs causality situation
<amigoo89>	okay the error is:
<amigoo89>	let's assume #3 value is okay (200) and the #1 value is not okay ("a"), then #3 is true (because #1) is true
<amigoo89>	what I don't get
<amigoo89>	because it is 3 different IFs
<Torkable>	wow the linter on this site is a nazi
<Torkable>	ok you didn't import jquery
<Torkable>	for starters
<cjohnson>	asm0deus: good lord that formatting. click the tidy button in your JS pane :P
<Torkable>	also make a bin that actually works
<Torkable>	http://jsbin.com/vetexazogi/1/edit?html,js,console
<cjohnson>	I already explained the issue in #jquery where he double-posted his question :P
<Torkable>	every one of those values returns undefined

<amigoo89>	yes problem solved :P
<amigoo89>	thanks to johnson
<asm0deus>	Any help with how to counterclockwise this animation loop http://codepen.io/macsupport/pen/myrPjL would be greatly preciated.
<cjohnson>	asm0deus: yours or not, it's your example, so tidy teh code :P
<asm0deus>	cjohnson: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rVVmdB is that better?
<cjohnson>	yes thanks
<flexpaint>	anyone know of an off screen side menu that lets you use js within it
<cjohnson>	change line 45 to -360 asm0deus
<flexpaint>	like jpanelmenu but not terrible
<cjohnson>	and put teh rotateZ back to 360deg
<cjohnson>	seems to work for me
<Pepeevich>	Hi guys, Does E5 are supported by latest versions of popular browsers at present?
<cjohnson>	flexpaint: there's nothing about a side menu that prevnets you from using JS within it
<Pepeevich>	ES6*
<cjohnson>	your JS is just implemented wrong if it's not working
<cjohnson>	no Pepeevich. ES6 is not even fully formalized yet
<cjohnson>	for now, you can use
<markholmes>	Pepeevich, https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/
<cjohnson>	!es6-shim @ Pepeevich
<ecmabot>	Pepeevich: Use https://www.npmjs.com/package/es6-shim to get every backwards-compatible feature of ES6 in every browser and node.js! It's heavily tested, comes with Promises, and requires the !es5-shim.
<flexpaint>	cjohnson, how do i check what's wrong
<cjohnson>	that will give you a lot of the non-syntax pieces today, in all environments
<cjohnson>	if you want the syntax stuff, like classes or generators, you need babel
<cjohnson>	!babel @ Pepeevich
<NitroLiq>	Creeves: Thanks for pointing me in the right direction. Got it sorted by adding an index to the callback
<asm0deus>	cjohnson: youre right, thats the only thing I didnt try haha thanks cjohnson
<cjohnson>	flexpaint: debug it
<flexpaint>	cjohnson, i don't know how
<NitroLiq>	Basically, concatenating the callback with BUCKET name

<tds5016>	well, cloneDeep vs. clone apparently makes a difference. I'm a dummy :-).
<tds5016>	Thanks for the help in figuring that out though deltab, it's much appreciated!! :-)
<gravity13>	According to every polyfill I’ve found, Object.assign( { x: [ ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’ ] }, { x: [] } ) actually modifies ‘x’. Is this what it’s supposed to do?
<gravity13>	the result is { ‘x’ : [] } unlike what I’d expect it to be: { ‘x’: [‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’ ] }
<ljharb>	gravity13: yes, that's what it's supposed to do.
<ljharb>	gravity13: and it doesn't merge arrays or objects. it's a shallow assignment
<ljharb>	gravity13: so, in other words, the last "x" value in the list is always the winner - all the previous values are discarded.
<gravity13>	lol I’m using your polyfill
<gravity13>	that’s strange to me, I would presume it’d be opposite
<ljharb>	what do you mean opposite
<gravity13>	sort of like how _.merge works
<ljharb>	that's not the use case most people need.
<gravity13>	but I don’t understand the purpose of object.assign, to tell the truth
<ljharb>	one major use case is "Object.assign({}, defaults, options)`
<gravity13>	this is exactly what I’m doing
<ljharb>	so, you pass an empty object as the target
<gravity13>	Ah, I see.
<ljharb>	and the last source with a property is the one that wins when there's a collision.
<gravity13>	such as a function on the prototype
<ljharb>	no
<ljharb>	Object.assign only uses own properties and symbols.

<anth0ny_>	I’m working on a small js-heavy webapp. You can upload files, perform data transformations on them, and download the files. There’s been a strong effort do an object-oriented approach to the design, with classes that are instanciated when the page loads. I’ve been building out unit tests to test the classes using Karma / Mocha, but it seems that the frameworks don’t do well when testing the instanciated classes (that interact with the 
<anth0ny_>	heavily). Is this where something like CasperJS comes in? Is this what people mean by a “smoke test”?
<Sorella>	anth0ny_: it's not really a problem with the testing tools, but with your design approach :) It's hard-to-impossible to actually test heavy mutation/side-effect things. You can have tests that simulate users accessing your website, but those are (1) slow as fuck; (2) hard to write; (3) unreliable.
<Sorella>	anth0ny_: if you used something like React, specially if you model the events as streams passed down through the objects, then it becomes fairly trivial to test any state your interface might ever be
<anth0ny_>	Sorella: so, how does one test the implementation of the code they write? If you’re curious, you can see the code here: https://github.com/cugos/drop-n-chop/blob/master/src/js/controller/AppController.js#L21-L32 I wanted to build out a menu-bar of operations to run on files that were uploaded. Rather than make special classes for each operation, they are all instances of a class with particular args passed in on instanciation. How would you 
<anth0ny_>	something like that? or how would you refactor that?
<deltab>	anth0ny_: a smoke test is just a simple check that the system doesn't fail in a particularly obvious way: like connecting power to a circuit and checking whether smoke comes out
<anth0ny_>	deltab: so what is the term for testing the instanciation of an app? or is that general code-smell? I’m obviously new to writing full fledged apps in JS
<deltab>	testing how?
<MachinShin>	c
<anth0ny_>	deltab: basically, i’m speaking of the app with all of it’s requirements on foreign libs and possibly the presence of the dom
<deltab>	integration test?
<anth0ny_>	i suppose that may be what I’m talking about
<anth0ny_>	yeah, that seems to be a fitting term
<Sorella>	anth0ny_: you don't test the implementations, you test the interfaces and contracts those interfaces must fulfill. And it's hard to write any tests when you have something written in a mutability heavy style like what you've got there (because you have to set up and tear down the whole world before/after running each test. It's just too painful, and requires
<Sorella>	more code than all of your modules together). As I said, I'd go for a more declarative style of programming, so things are as easy to test as `function f(x){ return x + 1 }`, you just create the inputs, feed to the function, and check if the outputs are the things you expect.
<deltab>	a code smell is something you notice about code that hints at deeper problems: if there are lots of global variables, the functions may be highly interdependent, for instance
<anth0ny_>	Sorella: thanks, i appreciate that advice. so, to speak of the instanciation of those Operation classes in the example I gave, what would that look like in a more declarative style? I’m trying to keep it as DRY as possible, I can’t see how I’d do that without creating separate classes for each operation.
<anth0ny_>	deltab: ah, right, I meant more like if trying to test the implementation of an app is a general code-smell of bad design
<deltab>	ah
<anth0ny_>	i’m kinda getting the impression that it is
<anth0ny_>	i’m going to make up a really basic and probably bad example: imagine I had a a webapp that had three divs. one would represent a cat, one would represent a dog, and one represents a cow. I write a class that takes a div as an input and attaches a listener so that when that div is clicked, it has an alert that says either “meow”, “bark”, or “moo” based on the animal that div represents. I would write a single class “Animal” t
<anth0ny_>	takes in input for what dom element the class should bind to and what word it should return on a click.
<anth0ny_>	I’d then have a “controller” section that would glue it together
<anth0ny_>	where i’d say ‘new Animal(“bark”, “div#dog”)’ and so on for each animal
<anth0ny_>	what would be the right way to test that?
<anth0ny_>	I could easily test that the Animal class returns the sound that it’s given when clicked
<anth0ny_>	and that it binds properly
<anth0ny_>	but how do I test that the actual page has the 3 animals correctly instanciated?
<anth0ny_>	or, if the case, where did I go so wrong with the design?
<Sorella>	anth0ny_: this is an example of how things would look in React + JSX (https://github.com/robotlolita/raven/blob/master/source/scripts/screens/entry.sjs#L143-L167), this is an example of how things would look like with hyperscript: https://github.com/dominictarr/hyperscript#example
<anth0ny_>	Sorella: so what should I take away from those examples?
<Sorella>	anth0ny_: don't ever write things like "a.addChild(b)", favour "a(b)" / "make(a, [b])" / etc. That way you can just test if "a(b)" gives you the correct output
<anth0ny_>	Sorella: mulling that over in my head
<rajrajraj>	is there any option to check if an audio has reached say 5:00
<rajrajraj>	like audio.onTime(5:00, function(){});
<mindstorm8191>	rajrajraj: could you track the time passed in a seperate variable / system?
*	dseitz__ is now known as dseitz
<rajrajraj>	mindstorm8191:  like?
<rajrajraj>	mindstorm8191:  there is only onething audio.currentTime  which tells what time is it now at
<rajrajraj>	but i want an event to orrcur if it reaches say 5:00
<anth0ny_>	Sorella: to be honest, I’m not completely seeing the difference between a.addChild(b) and a(b). What would a(b) doing? a.addChild(b) (in my case) appends the child to the ‘a’ object’s dom element. that seems decently testable to me, no?
<mindstorm8191>	I don't know... I'm no javascript expert... but I think you could use an onTimeout after 5 minutes... and if they press pause or whatever, set up something to cancel the timeout, store the passed time, then reset the timeout when it starts again
<rajrajraj>	mindstorm8191:  checking everysecond that what time it has reached would be a bad idea
<anth0ny_>	Sorella: okay, I’m off to bed, thanks for the help
<Sorella>	anth0ny_: it constructs a data structure. For example, if you were to model a tree, you could do it like: `class Tree; class Leaf(value) : Tree { ... }; class Branch(left, right) : Tree`. So instead of `var x = new Leaf(); x.setValue(whatever); var y = new Branch(); y.setLeft(...); y.setRight(...)`, you just do `new Branch(new Leaf(...), ...)`

<siddharth030>	plz help ppl
<mindstorm8191>	siddharth030: what code do you have in setInterval?
<siddharth030>	$.ajax()
<siddharth030>	it reads whats in text file
<boar>	That's why
<mindstorm8191>	...why do you want to repeatedly read from a text file?
<boar>	Avoid any file interaction
<boar>	Lets put it this way, reading from Ram is like flying to the moon and back
<siddharth030>	mindstorm8191 : there is a process which will finish and write done in text file
<boar>	Reading from an ssd is like to saturn and back
<boar>	and reading from a hdd is like to pluto and back
<mindstorm8191>	siddharth030: ok, but that sounds like something that shouldn't be inside setInterval()
<siddharth030>	mindstorm8191::then how to accomplish this task
<al-damiri>	Hi #js.
<mindstorm8191>	siddharth030: I cannot answer that without understanding the reasons why you're reading data from a text file. What does the file contain?
<al-damiri>	How can I determine if an object/variable is of type let's jqXHR or (XMLHTTPRequest)? Is there anyway?
<siddharth030>	that file only contains work done
<al-damiri>	s/let's/let's say
<siddharth030>	i have a php file whcih will finish and will write to that text file work done

<JohnJohn>	I'm getting the following error, ReferenceError: Can't find variable: totalOf,  I'm trying to add a loop variable to the end of a global variable....https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8c9ddc5614225a77928f  any help would be awesome. Thanks
*	Mackledoge is now known as Mackan90096
<mindstorm8191>	siddharth030: ah... ok.  so your javascript program is supposed to report when PHP has finished its work?
<boar>	You wont be able to solve your lag problems with that implementation, siddharth030
<siddharth030>	ya
<siddharth030>	mindstorm8191:thats right
<mindstorm8191>	ok.  within PHP, would it be possible to, essentially, send a page to the user instead?  just hypothetically
<boar>	JohnJohn: TotalOf doesn't exist
<boar>	JohnJohn: try putting a var infront of it
<siddharth030>	mindstorm8191:what should i do??
<boar>	Or even better, instantiate it at top with the remainder of your vars
<JohnJohn>	I have a variable totalOf2 and I want to access it by using totalOf+j
<mindstorm8191>	siddharth030: are you currently using JQuery?
<siddharth030>	yes
<mindstorm8191>	ok.  I know this one tool called JSON.  its like a wrapper for ajax commands
<siddharth030>	how to use that
<boar>	Why totalOf2?
<siddharth030>	will i be able to call setinterval without freezing page
<boar>	And what is totalOf+j meant to accomplish?
<Sorella>	siddharth030: this is usually done with long polling, which isn't a good idea in PHP usually. In which case you're left to making sequential requests to the webserver. You should use a recursive setTimeout call for that AND allow a few seconds between each request so you don't crash your whole server.
<mindstorm8191>	what you want to do is use JSON to call the PHP page.  When its done, the PHP code will post a response.  You can then read that response from JSON in your javascript
<Sorella>	siddharth030: plus, most likely you're not actually using setInterval
<JohnJohn>	I'm counting....totalOf+j ++
<mindstorm8191>	and you can do this asynchronously, letting the rest of your page run until you get that response
<Sorella>	!code @ siddharth030
<ecmabot>	siddharth030: Show some code, but don't paste it on the channel. You can provide a test case we can run and help you with your problem with http://jsfiddle.net , http://jsbin.com , or http://requirebin.com . Sites like http://gist.github.com/ and http://bpaste.net are cool too.
<siddharth030>	Sorella:thats right but how to do that
<mindstorm8191>	and so then you won't even need the setInterval function for it... if I remember right.  Sorry, I'd give you more help with it, but the last I used that was like 2-3 years ago, and in a very large project.  I couldn't easily isolate the code
<siddharth030>	mindstorm8191: can i give you code on pastebin
<boar>	JohnJohn: So, j could be a 1 or a 2, and you are actually after totalOf1 or totalOf2?
<mindstorm8191>	siddharth030: I guess... but wouldn't do me much good.  I'm certainly not a JS expert
<siddharth030>	ok
*	mindstorm8191 has his own set of bugs to worry about
<JohnJohn>	when j ==2 i want to add 1 to totalOf2  and so on...
<JohnJohn>	up to 12
<boar>	Right, so what you want to do is store 'totalOf' in an object, for example var totals = {totalOf1: 0, totalOf2: 0}; etc
<boar>	And then access the total via totals['totalOf'+j]
<JohnJohn>	Okay I'll try it, thanks!
<boar>	The only real way you can access a variable through a string references is via an object in js, and this lets you do just that
<JohnJohn>	Okay that makes sense
<boar>	Note totals['SomethingHere'] is the exact same as totals.SomethingHere
<boar>	But that latter is preferred where possible
<JohnJohn>	right
<JohnJohn>	thanks

<mindstorm8191>	siddharth030: hmm... does the ajax() function have a success() function within it?
<siddharth030>	yes
<mindstorm8191>	well - I think that's all you need.  does that success() function accept data from, like, the page it called?
<ashnur>	where are my typed objects X(
<mindstorm8191>	...okay, well in this example, they're using it as though it does: success:function(feed), where feed is the data received.  All you'd have to do is have your PHP file output 'process complete' or whatever, as though it were a webpage, and the success function will receive that text into the feed variable in your ajax call
<mindstorm8191>	you don't even need setInterval() here - the success() will run at soon as the PHP program is done running.  Just set up your ajax code in the JQuery onLoad function.

<fairyface>	I have some external JavaScript which sets a div element. I cannot obtain it using getElementById or querySelector. I do wait for the DOM to complete loading before I execute my code
<fairyface>	anyone have an idea as to what can cause this?
<Maxdamantus>	fairyface: you need to do it after the code that creates it has executed.
<Maxdamantus>	fairyface: but generally, that's a bad idea imo.
<Maxdamantus>	fairyface: you shouldn't need to generate elements with ids.
<fairyface>	Maxdamantus: you mean after the dom has loaded?
<Maxdamantus>	fairyface: no. After the code that creates the element has been executed.
<Maxdamantus>	(and inserts it into the DOM)
<fairyface>	Maxdamantus: that is what I am doing. The external JS executes, then I execute my JS
<Maxdamantus>	Are you sure you're doing it after the actual code that adds the element to the DOM has been executed?

<xqo>	hi
<xqo>	how do you store a not-yet-called method, and execute it later? http://jsfiddle.net/y61vveLw/
<xqo>	i want to run getUint8(0) on my dataview once im ready to do so
<xqo>	nvm, figured out
<marcules>	xqo you mean like - passing a function as var?
<xqo>	no like this, marcules http://jsfiddle.net/y61vveLw/3/
<xqo>	but i want to extend 'method, I also want to retrieve the charcode it reads
<xqo>	how can i do that?

<nbt>	pallet: what issues?
<pallet>	I've got a contact form that in the email field, where it DID throw an error in the field it not shows the javascript in there instead
<xqo>	HI! I want the return value of DICT[1].get be a charcode (ie String.fromCharCode) when it is applied. How can I make it so? http://jsfiddle.net/y61vveLw/4/

<notsacho>	you could alternatively look into a library that implements "compose"

<notsacho>	it probably does, but he was using apply already
<falafel>	ah, I guess OP could bind `d`
<falafel>	compose(String.fromCharCode, DataView.prototype.getUint8.bind(d))
<falafel>	that would work afaik
<notsacho>	yeah, although he might not have d in scope in actual code
<falafel>	how about? http://jsfiddle.net/y61vveLw/8/
<falafel>	at that point might as well inline an anonymous function though, lol
<notsacho>	well, it's not compose's fault that the api is horrible
<zomg>	Ugh, fun times
<zomg>	I have a setTimeout which works if there's a console.log in it, but it stops working if I also add a function call into it...
<DragonPunch>	what do yall think about bundling e-mail?
<zomg>	adding the func call produces no error, but it also stops the console.log from outputting anything
<zomg>	because fuck logic
<zomg>	Firefox quality browser
<zomg>	At this point I'm really suspecting that there is an error but something is causing it to not show up in console...
<zomg>	or this is a bug in Firefox or something
<zomg>	because this makes zero sense :P
<notsacho>	"works" "doesn't work"
<zomg>	I thought works is fairly obvious =) works=the log outputs fine
<zomg>	doesn't work=it looks like the timeout never runs (no console output, the function isn't called either)
<shoky>	in my imagination your code works perfectly
<zomg>	I mean the code is like this literally: setTimeout(function() { console.log('This works'); }, 100); versus setTimeout(function() { console.log('This never outputs and function never runs'); hello(); }, 100);
<zomg>	:P
<zomg>	Attempting to attach the debugger to it using `debugger;` does nothing either in the latter case, nor does wrapping it in a try-catch

<michaelis>	Hi. What are the rules on .attribute and set/getAttribute? The .attribute doesn't work on for example <circle> to set an attribute. Why is that?
<notsacho>	what's .attribute?
<Nazral>	does it change anything if I use ' instead of " ?
<notsacho>	Nazral, not really.
<michaelis>	notsacho, Dot notation (.attr) instead of method.
<notsacho>	do you mean the properties of dom elements? Those are not attributes.
<zomg>	Now if youtube would process the video to a quality where you can actually see what the text says...
<notsacho>	attributes are generally what you get from parsing the html - properties are the live state of the dom element. Attributes don't get updated when the dom element's state changes, only properties do
<michaelis>	notsacho, Yes I mean the properties of DOM elements. But if these are not attributes, why then does getAttribute() work for setting the attribute and not the dot notation?
<michaelis>	setting the property I mean

<Eppiox>	not stretched by css or anything?
<Nazral>	not as far as I know
<Nazral>	but there is a problem because 100x100 places my fake square in the middle of the thing
<michaelis>	notsacho, Setting anyone of the properties on <circle> doesn't work with dot notation. You have to use setAttribute(). Also you have to create the elements with createElementNS(). Otherwise you get problems.
<Nazral>	Oh... I found where it comes from
<Nazral>	apparently the html size and css size aren't the same hting for canvas
<Eppiox>	ah yup. canvas has its own size stuff, I try to keep it 1:1 and not do any css on elements I make with things in canvas- others suggest otherwise
<michaelis>	nbt, Setting anyone of the properties on <circle> doesn't work with dot notation. You have to use setAttribute(). Also you have to create the elements with createElementNS(). Otherwise you get problems.
<nbt>	michaelis: apparently the properties of circle are read-only, which would explain why you can't set them using dot notation
<michaelis>	nbt, They are not read-only. You can set the properties so that you produce a circle of any size.

<notsacho>	it's technically possible that modifying svg attributes produces tangible results - I don't know much about the svg spec.
<notsacho>	michaelis: the documentation disagrees with you - just look at it.
<Giacomino>	!Ciao A tuttti
<Giacomino>	!list
<nbt>	michaelis: those properties are read-only (see the link) so you can't set them directly using dot notation
<nbt>	which is why dot notation doesn't work
<nbt>	but what you can do is change the corresponding attribute using setAttribute
<michaelis>	notsacho, It may be so but the browser doesn't.
<michaelis>	nbt, But why can I set them with setAttribute()?
*	notsacho shrugs
<austincheney_>	michaelis: nodes cannot be frozen or readonly
<michaelis>	If they are read-only? I'm clearly not understanding something here.
<austincheney_>	by nodes I mean DOM nodes
<notsacho>	michaelis: basically, 'because the spec says so'
<austincheney_>	even if you can freeze an object that represents a DOM node you can bypass this easily by just creating another reference to the same DOM node that isnt frozen
<notsacho>	michaelis: http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/single-page.html#svgdom-SVGDOMOverview All SVG DOM objects that directly correspond to an attribute... and so on

<no_gravity>	is there a way to scroll an element into the center of another element? here is an example where i would like to do it: http://jsfiddle.net/52n6uow2/
<javascript585>	Hi, is there any way to download media files from a server in the background using javascript?
<notsacho>	michaelis: my first guess is that since the underlying properties are not the same as the attributes, they didn't want to allow directly setting them, e.g. circle.cx = 5 producing an SVGAnimatedLength property(you'd then need circle.cx.baseVal.value, for example)
<livcd_>	!promises

So far I do something like `Math.round(a / 255 * 14)`, but I get '0' from time to time (obviously). I could add 1 and cap at '14', but that would mean cheating the original number. Any thoughts?

<nbt>	AirStar: then you can create Google maps url like this: "https://maps.google.co.uk/?q="+lat+","+lon+"&z=15"
<AirStar>	thanks
<Hannibal_Smith>	diphtherial, it's the only sane way to actually understand what the V8 does to your code
<Hannibal_Smith>	Guessing is a little hard
<diphtherial>	basically you replace the function call with the code itself to avoid having to push a stack frame, jump, and then restore it
<nbt>	AirStar: there's an example on the page you linked
<Sharaal>	wiherek: ah now I read you second thing describe is not defined. how you run mocha?
<diphtherial>	Hannibal_Smith: fair point
<AirStar>	yeah, good :) nbt
<phrearch>	hi
<Nazral>	https://jsfiddle.net/1yrhxzen/2/ Crucials my bad
<wiherek>	Sharaal: I dont actually want to run mocha, but it seems that it is the only way I can get it to work
<wiherek>	I am testing a hybrid app through an emulator
<javascript302>	Nazral: Look in the console.
<wiherek>	it is iOS, but the webview runs angular
<javascript302>	Nazral: Opps, too late.
<wiherek>	i dont think I run mocha
<phrearch>	is there a way to reference bar in Object.keys({foo: bar}).forEach() ?
<wiherek>	is there a way I can require mocha in a nodejs file?
<wiherek>	i only need the function
<wiherek>	describe and it
<wiherek>	i actually run chai inside that nodejs file
<javascript921>	Is it possible to load a .JS file in a .JS one ?
<wiherek>	javascript921: use import
<wiherek>	or require
<Crucials>	Nazral: works for me - i changed 'keydown' to 'click'
<javascript921>	wiherek: okay, thank you ! \o/
<Crucials>	unless you're looking for a continuous input kinda thing?
<Nazral>	Crucials: no
<Nazral>	Crucials: actually I think I might have a problem with firefox
<javascript921>	wiherek: it is part of ECMAS6
<Nazral>	or my pc
<wiherek>	yea
<wiherek>	use some other module loader
<javascript921>	Whiskey: so not all the browsers will know import() ... :/
<wiherek>	whatever you need
<Nazral>	Crucials: because now nothing works on firefox anymore
<wiherek>	commonJS, requireJS, browserify
<Crucials>	Nazral: this works for me anyway https://jsfiddle.net/1yrhxzen/3/
<Sharaal>	javascript302: use browserify which can load commonjs modules or something like webpack if having much legacy stuff
<javascript921>	wiherek: perhaps i can just add the DOM/HTML element SCRIPT with some "document.createNode", no ?
<Nazral>	Crucials: works for me now too, I restarted firefox
<Nazral>	thanks
<Sharaal>	javascript921: yes you can
<javascript921>	tx
<javascript921>	\o/
<Sharaal>	javascript921: the other line was for you too, I would recommend to use a better nickname -.-
<inimino>	diphtherial: because callbacks appear as variables at the call-site, inlining isn't really meaningful

*	Ulrike is now known as Moolrike
<wiherek>	ok, so I have another question
<wiherek>	consider how protractor and mocha etc are node apps
<wiherek>	how do they expose the functions ‘describe’
<wiherek>	OR how could I instantiate them from inside a node.js file
<wiherek>	what I need to do is perform a few tasks, including starting a webdriver session, then run the tests
<Sharaal>	wiherek: why not just use "npm test" command?

<michaelis>	Anyone here with experience with setAttributeNS?
<AirStar>	how can i open ‘Google map’ on my web site?
<xqo>	if in your getter you do this.ObjectThatGetterGets = 1, will the getter stop running when ObjectThatGetterGets is asked for, and you always get 1 instead?
<inimino>	michaelis: who still uses that?
<michaelis>	inimino, I thought it was necessary when working with SVG and it's namespace?
<michaelis>	At least createElementNS is.
<inimino>	ah, perhaps
<lamppid>	Which cdn better server to use for jquery and jquery-ui script google or jquery
<Crucials>	why not use it locally
*	Mackledoge is now known as Mackan90096
<michaelis>	inimino, At least I got it to work. For the attributes I set null as namespace. I wish the API documentation on MDN was more detailed.
<inimino>	michaelis: maybe you can add a note, it's a wiki
<AirStar>	how can i open ‘Google map’ on my web site?
<michaelis>	inimino, Maybe I will. But the problem is that the documentation speaks of setAttributeNS as recommended while the example uses null for the namespace declaration, without telling why.
<inimino>	michaelis: yeah, it's ... historical
<inimino>	michaelis: if you use setAttribute does it work?
<michaelis>	inimino, The same goes for createElementNS. It says that only the root element needs to be created with it but that is not the case. But maybe that differs if you create an element with javascript in comparison to create the directly in your .html file.
<michaelis>	inimino, setAttribute works. setAttributeNS works with the namespace set to null.
<inimino>	Ah, ok.
<inimino>	The namespaces XML baggage is slowly dying but it's taking too long.
<michaelis>	inimino, It's trial and error all the way.
<michaelis>	inimino, Really? Will it be deprecated in the future?
<inimino>	Probably a non-namespaced version of SVG in HTML will eventually become the norm.
<inimino>	But XML still exists and SVG outside of HTML is still XML so it's not that simple.
<Havvy[Hex]>	Well, the HTML specs still allow you to send your HTML over as XML, so the methods do have some use if that's what you're doing.
*	Havvy[Hex] is now known as Havvy
<michaelis>	inimino, I understand. Too bad then if your code consists of the namespace methods.
<inimino>	Yeah, except sending XML is a useless thing to do.
<cjohnson>	AirStar: read their docs.
<inimino>	michaelis: it's unlikely those methods will ever go away, it's just kind of unfortunately overcomplicated
<cjohnson>	there are lots of ways
<AirStar>	give me link, cjohnson
<inimino>	but that's the Web :)
<cjohnson>	AirStar: google it. "google maps documentation"
<cjohnson>	don't be lazy.
<AirStar>	thanks cjohnson
<cjohnson>	np
<michaelis>	inimino, I understand. Thank you for the information. So it's sort of organized chaos.
<cjohnson>	you prob want the javascript API v3
<inimino>	Yep. :)
<ezakimak>	i thought xhtml was dead
<cjohnson>	not "dead", but mostly redundant/irrelevant
<Havvy>	ezakimak:  XHTML as its own specification is dead.
<inimino>	it's dead enough
<ezakimak>	good. i thought it was annoying.
<Havvy>	HTML encoded over XML is alive. Even has its own (short) chapter in the HTML5 spec.
<cjohnson>	it feels the same about you
<ezakimak>	and I'm okay with that
<inimino>	marginally alive
<inimino>	I would guess application/xml+xhtml on the web peaked years ago, probably below 0.05%
<AirStar>	there is Github that make Google map?
<tumulte>	is use strict still relevant in ES6 ?
<NoiseEee>	AirStar: the official Google Maps documentation has some really simple examples to get you up and running? https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial
<AirStar>	thanks NoiseEee
<cjohnson>	yes tumulte
<AirStar>	:)
<cjohnson>	I don't see it going away any time soon
<jaawerth>	tumulte: yes, but IIRC it's implied in modules
<cjohnson>	ohh neat I didn't know that
<cjohnson>	is there a way to opt out?
<jaawerth>	that COULD just be specific to babel
<jaawerth>	but I think traceur does it too
<tumulte>	jaawerth: what does this mean ?
<jaawerth>	nope, it's part of the spec http://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-strict-mode-code
<inimino>	yes, it's specified that way

<cjohnson>	Module code is always strict mode code.
<cjohnson>	no opting out I guess
<cjohnson>	cool
*	zz_robotmayo is now known as robotmayo
<jaawerth>	tumulte: it means you don't need to declare "use strict" in an ES6 *module* because it's done automatically
<tumulte>	jaawerth: what is a module in this context ?
<javascript658>	for (var z = 0; z < str.length; z++) { 		if(str[z] == ' ') { 			str[z]= '_'; 		} 		res += str[z]; 	}
<javascript658>	this should replace all the spaces by _
<javascript658>	but it doesn't work
<javascript658>	nothing is replaced
<javascript658>	do you know why ?
<jaawerth>	!modules @tumulte
<ecmabot>	tumulte: The current specification of ECMAScript doesn't define modules. Second-class modules are coming in ES6, but JS is powerful enough to encode first-class ones. Major implementations include AMD, CommonJS and Node modules (a modified CJS system). All of them can be used in any JS VM, including browsers.

*	iiulian is now known as Guest73315
<SylvieLorxu>	Hey everyone. I'm working on a JavaScript based game which currently has some XSS exploits. Would removing <script>, </script>, <noscript> and </noscript> be enough to prevent XSS, or am I forgetting other tags that could possibly be evil?
<inimino>	javascript658: did something lead you to think Chrome doesn't support regexes?
<nbt>	javascript658: res = str.replace(/ /g, "_")
<javascript658>	inimino: yes , "Note: The flags argument does not work in v8 Core (Chrome and Node.js). " (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace)
<javascript658>	nbt: tx, but the fc replace seems to work very well ^
<inimino>	javascript658: you put the regex flag on the regex, not as an argument to replace
<bberry>	javascript658, works fine: https://jsfiddle.net/nxu3knzy/
<javascript658>	inimino:  return str.replace(' ', '_', 'g'); it works :)
<javascript658>	ok thaks x
<javascript658>	x)
<inimino>	the version nbt showed you is the correct one
<cjohnson>	javascript658: to anwer your question, your original script doesn't work because you're modifying two different variables
<cjohnson>	I dunno if you can modify a string via array-style indexes
<cjohnson>	>> var foo = 'foo'; foo[1] = 'x'; foo
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: (string) 'foo'
<cjohnson>	yeah, it's read-only
<javascript658>	cjohnson: so my scripts didn't work because string can't be modified as array ?
<cjohnson>	right, only read
<cjohnson>	>> var foo = 'foo'; foo[1]
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: (string) 'o'
<cjohnson>	reads o, but as you can see in the example above, foo[1] doesn't let you write that character
<javascript658>	but if strings are read-only, why concatenation is possible ? x)
<cjohnson>	because you build a new string
<javascript658>	wow :o
<javascript658>	nice
<javascript658>	tx:)
<cjohnson>	no prob
<bberry>	now if only that were true for everything in js o.0
<jaawerth>	you can't modify anything in JS on the top level since JS is call-by-value, and strings are nothing but top-level ;-)
<cjohnson>	what do you mean by top-level?
<cjohnson>	I thought the explanation is "strings are immutable"
<jaawerth>	well I mean, the whole call-by-value behavior of JS. Even with objects, you're just passing around the *value* of the object's reference, which is immutable
<inimino>	All the primitive types are immutable.
<jaawerth>	yeah
<jaawerth>	you can access a string's individual characters using index but you're still just dealing with the base level string
<jaawerth>	you can't "dereference" a string in other words
<proteneer>	anyone know how to make fancy svg line styles? eg. something like >>>>>>> or dashed lines?
<cjohnson>	don't let sacho hear you say that
<tumulte>	jaawerth: aaahh those modules... the python copycat :). You mean that when you do import foo from bar, the imported module will be strict
<jaawerth>	tumulte: yes
<tumulte>	jaawerth: but not the "main" script ? you still need a "use strict" on top ?
<jaawerth>	well, I believe you still need to wrap it inside of a function, but you'd probably want your "main" script inside a module or an IIFE anyway

<AirStar>	how can i hide my Google API key?
<cjohnson>	el_juliano: that isn't really a javascript question but a facebook question
<cjohnson>	AirStar: there's no need to
<cjohnson>	you mean the maps API key right
<cjohnson>	it's meant to be public
<cjohnson>	hackal: !(obj instanceof Array)
<cjohnson>	object is not an array ^
<AirStar>	cjohnson: some one copy my key, then he or she will use my key .
<cjohnson>	AirStar: right, that's fine. your key doesn't give access to anything sensitive
<AirStar>	then i will pay for more using.
<cjohnson>	you pay for google maps API?
<AirStar>	yes.
<AirStar>	there are much using, then i must pay for much using map
<cjohnson>	you're going to be using more than 25k views per day?
<AirStar>	i don’t know
<cjohnson>	well then why are you worrying about something you don't even know about yet?
<AirStar>	some programmer copy my key, then he will use it for free.
<cjohnson>	they don't mind occasional spikes: The Maps API usage limits do not take effect until a site has exceeded the limits for 90 consecutive days. If your site has met this requirement and you are purchasing excess map loads online, the Google APIs Console allows a cap on usage to be set on a project to protect against unexpected increases in use after billing has begun. See the Google APIs Console Help for more details.
<cjohnson>	if you aren't using over 25k views per day, you shouldn't pay for it
<cjohnson>	then there's no risk of anybody else abusing your limits
<cjohnson>	I also think google will check the domain the request is coming from
<cjohnson>	again. it's meant to be public
<NoiseEee>	AirStar: there's no reason for anyone else to use your API key when they can use their own
<AirStar>	thanks cjohnson :)

<ezakimak>	actually, no they are not
<ezakimak>	from my understanding (and last time I perused the IEEE spec) they help indicate how 0 was reached
<madgriff>	hey guys I could use some suggestions on how to test an object that returns a function in js
<ezakimak>	eg from an overflow or underflow
<DDR>	ezakimak: They’re also useful for some math, but it’s pretty obscure math.
<ezakimak>	so while for the purposes of ordinary arithmetic there is no difference, in some cases it matters
<DDR>	I think there’s only one way to get -0 in JS, it tries really hard to pretend it doesn’t exist.
<ezakimak>	so, really they exist for completeness
<ezakimak>	madgriff, how does an object return anything?
<ezakimak>	unless it is a callable object (iow a function)
<madgriff>	ezakimak:good point
<tinylobsta>	general question about memory leaks: if i have an array whose retained size keeps growing on each subsequent pass of my function, is that array indicative of where the memory leak is located?
<UndeadBizkit>	hey i am currently working through the codecadamy javascript course but in the OOP section they keep talking about classes, i thought javascript is a class-less language or am i wrong?
<madgriff>	ezakimak: that being said, suggestions on testing such a function
<ezakimak>	UndeadBizkit, you are not
<UndeadBizkit>	so is it just a naming mistake on their part?
<cjohnson>	madgriff: what do you mean? you want to write unit tests for your functions?
<ezakimak>	madgriff, test it like anything else. enumerate the valid conditions, assert the assumptions and results
<cjohnson>	there are all kinds of test suites. jasmine I hear, or tape
<madgriff>	ezakimak: ok thanks
<cjohnson>	tinylobsta: is the array intended to grow on each pass? a memory leak is just another name for unintended continuous growth based on execution time
<ezakimak>	UndeadBizkit, it is unfortunate. people try to use language and concepts they are familiar with rather than simply use what's native to javascript
<cjohnson>	but if your array is intended to grow over time, it's not a leak
<tinylobsta>	cjohnson: no, it's suppose to clear out its contents on each pass
<ezakimak>	there are ways to get *similar* behavior to some concepts from other languages, not identical, and not without some effort on the coder's part
<cjohnson>	ES6 introduces the class keyword, but it's just sugar over the existing prototype system
<tinylobsta>	cjohnson: i can't understand why it's not being garbage collected, though
<cjohnson>	tinylobsta: because you continue to reference it, so your clearing code must not be working if the array continues to grow
<ezakimak>	imo, using terms foreign to what the language actually provides is counterproductive to learning it with a true understanding
<cjohnson>	paste code?
<tinylobsta>	cjohnson: i never explicitly clear it, i assumed that GC would grab it for me
<UndeadBizkit>	ezakimak: ok thanks for clearing that up for me, they keep changing vocabulary and it was driving me insane since i couldn't find any information about it
<cjohnson>	you add elements to an array, and never explicitly clear that array, and you expect the array to clear on each pass? why would you assume that?
<ezakimak>	sounds like a poor tutorial
<cjohnson>	I hear bad things about code academy a lot
<tinylobsta>	cjohnson: because i'm using setTimeout to begin the function again after X amount of seconds
<ezakimak>	sounds like it was written by a non-javascript user
<cjohnson>	I have had good experience using eloquent
<tinylobsta>	from what i understood, GC would do its thing upon subsequent finish of the function
<ezakimak>	and mdn guide isn't bad either
<cjohnson>	tinylobsta: I don't see how that is relevant. if you define an array, wor on it, and then enver reference it, then yes GC will clear it
<ezakimak>	tinylobsta, we can't see your code so we don't know
<willv2>	tinylobsta: Don't think about GC, think about scope.
<cjohnson>	we need code yeah
<cjohnson>	stop talking about it and just paste it
<ezakimak>	!paste
<ecmabot>	ezakimak: Show some code, but don't paste it on the channel. You can provide a test case we can run and help you with your problem with http://jsfiddle.net , http://jsbin.com , or http://requirebin.com . Sites like http://gist.github.com/ and http://bpaste.net are cool too.
<UndeadBizkit>	i'll check those out, i just needed a refresh on javascript for when i get back into university next month
<cjohnson>	I'd suggest eloquent then. MDN is a fantastic reference but it isn't very structured, it's just a collection of wiki articles
<fatbrain>	ezakimak: Last time you persued the spec maybe you shouldn't skip the part defining 0 and -0 as EQUAL. Even tho they have two different binary representations.
<tinylobsta>	cjohnson: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/fe2b224e11240b643513
<cjohnson>	equal but not the exact same

<tinylobsta>	or the databaseQuery
<tinylobsta>	both with store massive amounts of data into two variables
<tinylobsta>	which*
<cjohnson>	wait, I thought you said you had a memory leak
<cjohnson>	are you just guessing?
<tinylobsta>	no, i've taken snapshots of my heap dump, and i can clearly see an array growing between each subsequent pass of the function
<tinylobsta>	but the heap dump doesn't tell me where
<cjohnson>	I would try profiling it
<tinylobsta>	i'm using v8-profiler and node-inspector and it's not giving me relevant info
<tinylobsta>	other than that i have an array constructor that is growing in size over time on each snapshot and pass of the function
<cjohnson>	and it doesn't tell you which array?
<tinylobsta>	no, it's nonspecific
*	blazedd is now known as Blazedd[AFK]
<tinylobsta>	but i only have two arrays of consequence in that gist i posted, so i'm assuming it's one of those

<ezakimak>	*signed
<cjohnson>	tinylobsta: I would step debug this function then
<cjohnson>	presumably the arrays of consequence are returned at the end, and then they stop existing and being used
<cjohnson>	not even returned. looks like you look up some data, then operate on it, and then that's it
<ezakimak>	an unintentional closure can hit you
<cjohnson>	so there's no reason it should continue to exist after the waterfall completes
<tinylobsta>	i agree, but the memory leak is large
<fatbrain>	ezakimak: What operations?
<cjohnson>	thus the suggestion I just made to step debug it and figure out exactly what's being repeated
<cjohnson>	it shoudln't leak at all, not just a little bit, but none at all, if the array stops being used  after the function ends
<tinylobsta>	since this is async, if the setTimeout were to somehow get triggered prior to the original function finishing, would this cause a cascading issue?

<cjohnson>	I don't think it would unless I'm missing something

<tinylobsta>	hmm, bummer
<tinylobsta>	alright, i'll try step debugging it
<ezakimak>	i'm having trouble following the scoping/nesting w/2-space indentation
<ezakimak>	it looks like most of those functions are declared inside your soapRequest function--thus every invocation will create new functions also
<ezakimak>	but they should get GC'd after each return
<tinylobsta>	ezakimak: using async.waterfall, aren't they declared independently of the soapRequest function? and the soapRequest is just passing a data array into the next function?
<ezakimak>	sorry, i had to stare hard at it to see they are all elements in the argument array
<ezakimak>	better indenting FTW. btw.

<ezakimak>	oh thank god. I can work with that w/o cramping my brain and making my eyes bleed
<UndeadBizkit>	oh btw could someone tell me why this little project i made seems to be pretty performance intensive, all it does is check and display the time and display a random image onLoad it seems pretty simple but it for some reason it is kicking up the fans in my macbook pretty hard is it the constant updating of the time? https://jsfiddle.net/njansen/6bor8grw/
<cjohnson>	;P
<tinylobsta>	quit making fun of my indentation ;(
<cjohnson>	I get like 3-5% CPU spike UndeadBizkit which seems normal for the speed and animation
<cjohnson>	Don't use window.onload = though UndeadBizkit
<cjohnson>	same with body onload=
<ezakimak>	I don't see anything wrong with that code, it only fires twice/second
<cjohnson>	!inline
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: Using inline event handlers is bad practice and results in poorly factored, hard-to-manage code. Consider attaching your events with Javascript, instead, eg: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener
<UndeadBizkit>	mh i need to get something that checks gpu load on my mac

<Jemaivu>	Guys
<ezakimak>	it may be fine
<tinylobsta>	ohhh, i just went back to my gist and saw that somehow everything got indented underneath that soapRequest
<tinylobsta>	that's not how my code actually looks :p

<tinylobsta>	and on each subsequent function where it's called, it should be closing out the connection on its own
<tinylobsta>	i could try switching over to the more discrete client = new pg.Client and closing it on client.end() and see if that makes a difference
<ezakimak>	just a tiny style note: I always compare against constants with <const> == variable as a habit from C/C++, eg your array[index + 1] === undefined test, to avoid accidentally assigning w/a typo
<ezakimak>	it's not critical, but it has saved me a few times over the years
<tinylobsta>	ezakimak: good tip, i'll make that change

<romseguy>	the equivalent of something like that: obj.map(el => { if (_.isArray(el) el.map(eel => { if (_.isArray(eel) ... }) })
<romseguy>	well there are missing if parenthesis but you get the idea
<ezakimak>	mmmveggies, you can always query the mysql database tables directly
<PotPlant_>	romseguy: recursion
<ezakimak>	but why do you need help parsing it? it should return it in table format just the same as any other query

<granden>	Hi, if I need help to make my google maps load asyncrounosly can I get it here? Or do I need to head over to a google specific channel? This is my code: http://hastebin.com/xetuxudume.coffee
<ezakimak>	well, coffee script isn't javascript.
<granden>	it is not coofeescript
<granden>	coffee*
<ezakimak>	then ask away
<granden>	I dont know why the file ending is that, the hastebin site did use it not me
<ezakimak>	you don't need type in script tags
<ezakimak>	unless it's not javascript
<khmer>	hastebin always mistakes js for coffeescript
<granden>	Ok, I see.
<khmer>	its intelligent syntax detector isn't
<khmer>	you can just change the url to say ".js" instead and it'll change the syntax
<granden>	Ah I see, coolt
<ezakimak>	isn't it async already?
<ezakimak>	what is {{ $addresses }}, is this using handlebars??
<granden>	Oh, sorry that is blade syntax from Laravel framework.
<granden>	That just includes a array generated in php
<ezakimak>	you have several spelling typos: 'adresses' one 'd'
<granden>	ezakimak: Hehe, yeah swedish spelling is adress and I always spell that worng in english. :(
<ezakimak>	ah, ok.
<granden>	My real problem is that google complains about my map, it says it takes to long to load. ANd I should load it async or later in the page
<granden>	I have put the javascript and the include of the external javascript at the bottom of my page
<granden>	Dont know what else to do.
<granden>	https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=rentia.se&tab=desktop
<ezakimak>	the include of what external javascript?
<granden>	the google api file
<granden>	the one I have in the hastebin.
<granden>	All that is at the bottom of the page.
<bact>	granden: it's talking about css too
<ezakimak>	that really shouldn't matter since you are waiting for dom ready
<Jemaivu>	guys, may I ask what channel for discussing about UI desgin (mobile something) on freenode?
<ninjs>	So you can submit less than the "normal" amount of parameters to a function, just not more, right?
<ezakimak>	you could try ##design
<granden>	bact: Yeah, but what I have learned css should always be included in the <head> section. Or am I wrong? Because I have combined and minified my css
<ninjs>	so like myFunction(x,y,z){do stuff;}  then call myFunction(x,y)
<granden>	Acctually dont know how to do anything more. If you could help I would be really happy
<ezakimak>	you can link to css anywhere in the dom, actually
<Jemaivu>	thank you ezakimak
<gnarMatix>	trying to set a base uri for superagent.  can anyone help?
<granden>	ezakimak: Ok, but I dont think that is the big deal because If I remove my map form the code I get like 92 points on google page speed
<ezakimak>	so is the map not working, or just working slowly?
<granden>	ezakimak: It is working, and quite well form a user perspective. But not according to google page speed

<pauled>	Hi, how can I use document.getElementsByClassName("classname"); with 2 class?
<bact>	granden: what about the async attribute for the script tag?
<granden>	ezakimak: Because I only get like 77 points and what all seo experts tells me the pagespeed should be at least 85 , it helps the seo.
<ezakimak>	you don't. use document.querySelector() or querySelectorAll()
<ezakimak>	does google calculate pagespeed and use that in it's seo equation, really??
<ezakimak>	I can't imagine they'd penalize your page for using *their* maps
<GreenJello>	ezakimak, that, and a bunch of other things

<ezakimak>	every project i've worked on that had it, eventually got rid of it
<SylvieLorxu>	Does anyone understand why this code breaks when I remove the console.log? http://0bin.net/paste/E68A1QlzmPIAFtpN#OtC+XB2-9tEXJT65VSrqsDCKg0ExCbQ3Mk0gqjvarcR
<sshade>	hi! Are there any JS gurus here? I have extremely strange issue and don't even know where to look to fix it. there's code like this: https://jsfiddle.net/yq7jcdk5/, i. e. on .target hover overlay appears, both events are logged (mouseenter, mouseleave), but for some reason if I insert any element in .target mouseleave event won't fire (can't be reproduced in this jsfiddle)
<sshade>	can someone suggest where to look?
<ezakimak>	SylvieLorxu, well, your console.log() call is modifying the value of timevalue variable
<bradleymeck>	SylvieLorxu: because the `--` I would presume?
<khmer>	sshade: "mouseleave" is not a standard event--does mootools simulate it like jquery does?
<ezakimak>	isn't it mouseout?
<khmer>	they behave differently
<khmer>	mouseout is a real event, mouseleave is an IE event, albeit one with an interesting feature
<sshade>	it's definitely mouseleave. it's third-party code I don't have access to. I need to insert this div, but it breaks this mouseleave functionality somehow
<khmer>	sshade: mouseleave only triggers at the moment the element directly under the pointer stops being the element in question--which can't happen when there's a screen-wide overlay
<sshade>	but it works, actually
<sshade>	it stops working when I add empty div in .target
<sshade>	(or non empty)
<khmer>	looks like mootools also polyfills it
<sshade>	that's really misterious
<khmer>	sshade: this may not work for all browsers, but you might try setting pointer events in css
<khmer>	one sec
<SylvieLorxu>	ezakimak, bradleymeck: Well, okay, that makes partial sense, I'm still confused as to why timeelement.text(timevalue--); didn't work but that hint allowed me to easily work around it (split lowering timevalue and setting the text into two statements)
<SylvieLorxu>	So thanks
<ezakimak>	because timevalue-- is post decrement
<ezakimak>	before you had it in the log call, so it was decremented before passing to text()
<ezakimak>	you could use text(--timevalue)
<SylvieLorxu>	ezakimak, Ah!
<khmer>	sshade: yeah, pointer-event: none seems to work in the majors
<khmer>	might have problems in IE
<khmer>	sshade: https://jsfiddle.net/yq7jcdk5/1/
<SylvieLorxu>	Well, that's the first time in my life I see an actual difference between var-- and --var
<SylvieLorxu>	Thanks so much
<ezakimak>	um, there's an off-by-one difference every time
<mmmveggies>	yeah i hope you haven't been willy-nilly writing either one into a while loop...
<sshade>	khmer: thanks for suggestion, I'll look into it, seems promising
<khmer>	sshade: sorry, i mean pointer-events: none
<khmer>	not pointer-event: none
<khmer>	you see it working, right?
<sshade>	yeah, I see how it works, just not sure if this applies to my case
<sshade>	the thing is, it works as is, but div breaks. I'll try to aply that to div, maybe it will fix issue
<khmer>	i'm not sure i understand, but the great thing about css is that you can override from anywhere
<taninhale>	I have a javascript question is this a place to ask

<jonrh>	Yeah I'm a bit conflicted on that, from what I gather Auth0 basically created JWT.
<jaawerth>	actually, just skimmed that article and it's more or less on point
<jaawerth>	but what's to worry about? the jwt concept is simple enough taht you can implement itself rather than abstracting it TOO much like with those libraries
<jonrh>	True. It does indeed seem to the best thing out there.
<jaawerth>	by which I mean, tehre are lower level libs that can be used
<deltab>	the worry is that you implement it yourself poorly
<jaawerth>	and yeah, they're just so, so much more flexible than sessions or cookies or what-have-you
<jonrh>	* from what I've seen so far. But I'm very inexperienced in this. My primary concern is not to fuck it up. Like creating my own salting+hashing instead of using bcrypt.
<jaawerth>	but at a glance, that vunlerability was with some of the libs that take care of the whole process for you, rather than the ones that just allow you to call functions for encoding, decoding, verifying, etc with your own parameters to determine behavior
<jaawerth>	I'd recommend putting together the auth stuff using libs that handle the various steps, but calling the steps yourself so you can ensure they're called properly and with each step enforced
<jaawerth>	jonrh: what platform did you want to use for your server backend?
<jonrh>	jaawerth: I'm in a two man team. I'm doing the front end as a SPA in React + Flux. My co-worker is doing the back-end API in C#.
<jaawerth>	ah
<jaawerth>	well, then you aren't the one who has to worry about implementation haha
<jaawerth>	as long as you trust your coworker
<jaawerth>	the client-side stuff is all about consumption and you never want to enforce security on the client side anyway
<jaawerth>	(Because it's basically impossible)
<jonrh>	What do you mean by enforcing security on the client side?
<GreenJello>	jonrh, your frontend code is one client that can talk to the backend, but I could write another client that says whatever I want it to say to the backend
<jaawerth>	I mean, the client should really only be responsible for storing, clearing, attaching the token to API requests, and MAYBE some authorization stuff but only to save an extra call to the server/speed things up
<jonrh>	Ahh yeah got ya.
<jaawerth>	what GreenJello said. Or you could write your client, and I could inject javascript into it via devtools to or greasemonkey or a milicious plugin to bypass any security you try to put into the client code
<jaawerth>	malicious*
*	MichD is now known as michd
<jaawerth>	ultimately, the server will respond to any protected endpoints that *don't* have an authorized token attached with a 400 error
<jaawerth>	any authorization stuff you put in the client will mostly just be so your app can have a reasonable guess as to what paths to make available in advance
<GreenJello>	401
<jaawerth>	er, yeah, 401. sorry, I mean 400-level in general
<jonrh>	What's your opinion on storing the token in the localStorage / sessionStorage? I read some articles today saying it was not safe.
<jaawerth>	depends on what browsers you need to support. IIRC, localStorage had some issues with legacy browsers that can lead to cross-domain access
<jaawerth>	but hell, you can store it in a cookie
<GreenJello>	'safe' depends on the attack vector, if you're worried about someone running a program on the user's computer which steals passwords from the localStorage files... then it's unsafe
<jaawerth>	if you're worried about someone running a program on a user's computer, no sort of storage is going to work
<jaawerth>	except *maybe* in-memory
<GreenJello>	jonrh, you're pretty much fine with localStorage except in very specific applications involving finance or medical software
<jonrh>	The service we're creating is very niche and low-value target with prolly less than 200 users. I guess localStorage will do.
<jaawerth>	and with very specific legacy browsers, IIRC
<jonrh>	GreenJello: Ahh yeah cool, thanx for the clarification.
<jaawerth>	it should be safe on updated browsers, but you'd want to double-check that
<jaawerth>	a cookie always works too, you'd just be saving, loading, and deting it with client code rather than using it to attach automatically to a request header
<jonrh>	jaawerth: Will do.
<jaawerth>	oh, and I find it very handy to keep the active tokens in a REDIS cache, but that's just me
<jonrh>	jaawerth: On the server then?
<jaawerth>	yeah, that won't be your problem
<jaawerth>	but for verification and such
<jaawerth>	also so you can easily invalidate/force a refresh on a token
<jonrh>	Have you had any experience with 3rd party user authentication services like UserApp, Auth0, StormPath, etc?
<morenoh149>	anyone know of a good article on how to program a navbar that binds to scroll?
<jaawerth>	jonrh: personally, no - I never bother with them
<jaawerth>	jonrh: only because most of the work stuff I do requires we don't trust cloud services unless we have specific SLAs with them, due to our clients' data security requirements
<jonrh>	jaawerth: Ahh ok got you.

<jbt>	hi, does anyone know how i can stub/spy a class method in sinon so that i can check if it's called during the constructor?
<jonrh>	Yeah think so. Of all the third party ones I find it most appealing, they seem very serious and professional about their stuff. I think UserApp may be dying out. Their last tweet is nearly a year old, little to no activity on GitHub repos. Someone on twitter screaming at them to answer his support emails.

<jaawerth>	Ellis: also you wouldn't want to do it that way, for..in will not only iterate over an object's properties, but also its entire prototype chain, which will get you stuff you didn't want
<falafel>	Ellis, youi probably want a collection though, nested objects is not a very good idea
<okdamn>	how do i remove the first array item from the array?
<okdamn>	delete array[0] ?
<falafel>	okdamn, newarray = array.slice(1)
<falafel>	don't mutate the array, create a new array without the first element
<okdamn>	falafel:  mmm i need not to use newarray i just want to remove the item from the array
<notsacho>	how sneaky of you to not remove items while answering the question
<okdamn>	falafel:  it's a queue for users i can't create a new one
<falafel>	okdamn, change the program so you dont need to mutate it
<okdamn>	falafel:  yeah
<jiggliemon>	regexp
<okdamn>	does array.slice(1) is not enought?
<jiggliemon>	^[a-zA-Z0-9\.\-]+$(?!system)
<jiggliemon>	alphanumeric, dots, dashes, but isnt "system" ?
<okdamn>	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2003815/how-to-remove-first-element-of-an-array-in-javascript
<jiggliemon>	What's the correct format?
<okdamn>	i think i've found !!?!?
<mmmveggies>	arr.shift() ?
<falafel>	jiggliemon, $ marks the end
<okdamn>	mmmveggies:  not better splice(0,1) ?
<jiggliemon>	falafel thanks
<mmmveggies>	are you copying the array or just editing the original
<notsacho>	jiggliemon: why not if (text !== "system" && text.match(regex)) instead?
<okdamn>	mmmveggies:  need to just edit the original
<jiggliemon>	notsacho this is for angulars ng-pattern directive.
<jiggliemon>	it's a regexp pattern.
<notsacho>	consider writing a ng-round-peg directive
<jiggliemon>	This looks like it works: /^(?!system)[a-zA-Z0-9\.\-]+$/
<falafel>	jiggliemon, underscores don't need to be included?
<jiggliemon>	Im trying to be pretty restrictive.

<Someguy123>	I have a function inside of a class "Renderer" called preloadImages(), it loads images and uses their onload callbacks to fire to another function inside of Renderer called imageReady(), but from imageReady() I'm unable to access "this" or "self" or any sort of way of accessing the parent class
<Someguy123>	how can I have the image onLoad event run "imageReady" without breaking my access to the class scope
<falafel>	Someguy123, post some code. But the bottom line, `this` depends on how that function is called
<falafel>	`this` won't magically reference your object
<cjohnson>	I'm having a brainfart. I have this quick and dirty spotify playlist dumper script: http://jsfiddle.net/f5sk5ed6/ but it appears that getPlaylistTracks only returns 100 tracks at a time. I can re-run it with an offset so I can paginate the data... but how should I go about refactoring this into building the array with repeating calls? put it in a func and recurse?
<mmmveggies>	does the api have a isLastPage variable?
<mmmveggies>	er, the response
<cjohnson>	I'm sure I can determine last page by seeing 0 results or something like what you say
<Someguy123>	falafel, https://gist.github.com/Someguy123/e6209d028f4570095cc0#file-gistfile1-js-L11
<falafel>	cjohnson, can't you do it in parallel with Promise.all
<falafel>	instead of recursing, just fill an array with 0-100, 100-200, 200-300... promises
<cjohnson>	it returns the total number of results so yeah I can check. the issue there falafel is I don't know how many promises exist until the first one returns
<falafel>	ah, that changes things I suppose
<cjohnson>	that's why I'm thinking recursive function
<Someguy123>	line 11 loads the image and fires the callback (2nd param) on image load, but I have no way of accessing "imagesLoaded" within the Renderer class once imageReady is fired
<falafel>	Someguy123, this.ih.loadImage(v, this.imageReady.bind(this));
<Someguy123>	aha
<Someguy123>	that worked great
<Someguy123>	thanks falafel
<mmmveggies>	so your first API call gives you the full pagination info.. can you just spawn the parallel promises from that?
<falafel>	Someguy123, why though? that's the question you have to ask yourself :)
<Someguy123>	falafel, why?
<cjohnson>	so just make an initial throw-away request just to get the total size mmmveggies?
<cjohnson>	or I guess I could just add the already-resolved promise to Promise.all
<falafel>	Someguy123, first thing you have to ask is, who's the caller?
<cjohnson>	hrm, neat
<falafel>	Someguy123, who calls imageReady?
<Someguy123>	falafel, according to my console, the Window object because it's fired by Image.onLoad
<Someguy123>	never knew about bind until now
<falafel>	Someguy123, but that's the consequence, the caller is loadImage
<falafel>	Someguy123, how do you think this.ih.loadImage calls this.imageReady?
<falafel>	so in `loadImage(v, callback)`, how is `callback` called?
<mmmveggies>	cjohnson it does sound like the best way to saturate your i/o with a known number of calls
<Someguy123>	falafel, it creates an "Image" object, sets its source, then places the callback in the onload function of that image, but I guess because the onload calls it, "this" became in the context of the image object/window
<falafel>	Someguy123, ok, but you are steering a way a bit. Now, how does `onload(callback)` call the callback?
<tubbo>	so is Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey still the best "user JS" plugin for browsers?
<Someguy123>	falafel, https://gist.github.com/Someguy123/599e045193e1639971a1
<falafel>	Someguy123, ok, I know what is happening, just asking you to ask yourself, heh. But yes, the call is in line `9`
<cjohnson>	can I do var foo = returnsPromise().then(function() { var work = [foo]; }); ? Will foo be the promise inside its callback?
<cjohnson>	or is there another way of getting the promise
<Someguy123>	falafel, I understand what's happening, but I've never ran into this kind of scope issue before despite years of JS experience :P
<falafel>	Someguy123, so it is called like `callback()`, that's where your issue originates
<Someguy123>	99% of the time I've fixed things with just "_self = this"
<falafel>	Someguy123, if there is no dot in the call, then there is no `this`
<mmmveggies>	I mean, it will be the promise, but i don't know you can gurantee it's in the state you want it to be in when the callback executes
<falafel>	Someguy123, if you where to call it like `something.callback()` or like `callback.call(something)` then `this === something`
<falafel>	*were
<Someguy123>	wow, never heard of call either
<falafel>	Someguy123, that's all there is to it, if you see a dot in the call, then think of the value of `this`, otherwise, it will default to `window (or `undefined` in strict mode)
<falafel>	!this @ Someguy123
<ecmabot>	Someguy123: If a function call is of the form `a.b()`, `this` will be the object you accessed the "b" property from. Otherwise, if it's of the form `a()`, `this` will be `undefined`, which is turned into the global object if the function isn't in strict mode. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/08/30/understanding-javascripts-this/
<Someguy123>	falafel, thanks for the help
<notsacho>	cjohnson: you can, but what is the point?
<cjohnson>	notsacho: did you read the prob?
<falafel>	Someguy123, check out the Eloquent book, it is a free book for beginners that people recommend a lot
<falafel>	!eloquent @ Someguy123
<ecmabot>	Someguy123: Eloquent JavaScript is a comprehensive introductory Web-based book with examples and a built-in interpreter. http://eloquentjavascript.net/
<Someguy123>	falafel, I'm not a beginner, it's just I've never had to deal with this kind-of scoping issue before, I've used javascript for years both client and server side (NodeJS)
<mmmveggies>	you could use babel and arrow functions
<falafel>	Someguy123, either way, call, apply, bind are essential, Eloquent covers all of that
<falafel>	jump the chapters you know about already
<Someguy123>	I'll look into that book, thanks falafel
<mmmveggies>	I jsut started writing in es6 and using babel and all I can say is YIPPIEE! Except it doesn't include Object.extend which is weird
<notsacho>	cjohnson: don't generators + promises very neatly resolve this?
<falafel>	mmmveggies, it is Object.assign
<mmmveggies>	er, yeah that
<cjohnson>	I have no clue. I'm using node
<falafel>	mmmveggies, yeah, it does include it
<cjohnson>	which doesn't support generators afaik. And either way, I didn't write the API
<mmmveggies>	really? in `npm install babel` ?
<falafel>	cjohnson, it does, but in harmony mode
<cjohnson>	ah. well either way I don't know generators enough and I think my solution is perfectly fine
<falafel>	mmmveggies, npm install -g babel babel-runtime
<notsacho>	well, time for the ad-hoc next() :p
<falafel>	mmmveggies, then babel-node will load the polyfill for you
<falafel>	mmmveggies, or probably you have to include it with `require('babel/polyfill')`
<mmmveggies>	yeah it did mention the polyfill
<jaawerth>	falafel: pretty sure babel includes the runtime?
<jaawerth>	I mean, I don't think you have to install it
<falafel>	ah, maybe not, I always do it like that because I step behind the most recent build and the runtime didn't get updated
<falafel>	maybe they fixed that already
<mmmveggies>	I wish it would just get released already
<mmmveggies>	so that it can maybe reach 20% of people's browsers by 2017
<NBhosting>	when i put data in the body tag like: <body gameid="12">  how do i get that in the js
<falafel>	NBhosting, use a data attribute
<falafel>	custom attributes are trouble
<NBhosting>	k let me look that up
<falafel>	`<body data-gameid=12>` then in JS, `element.dataset.gameid`
<falafel>	NBhosting, ^T

<ebmusicman>	updated to remove extra ), still no good http://jsfiddle.net/daaL4ga5/2/
<knod>	Just to check - there's no way to remove an anonymous event listener?
<knod>	by detecting it on a specific element

<AR45>	Write a progam that creates a string that represents an 8 x 8 grid, using new line characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chess board.
<GreenJello>	knod, you need a reference to the event handler to remove it
<GreenJello>	el.removeEventListener('click', clickHandler)
<knod>	GreenJello: Thanks, just making absolutely sure. Also, damn
<knod>	Oh, I don't need it to have a name?
<knod>	I just need to know the event and the handler?
<knod>	Hmm
<GreenJello>	you just need a reference to it
<GreenJello>	you can also do el.addEventListener('click', function myfn(){ something(); el.removeEventListener('click', myfn); });
<knod>	Oh, the event listener function _is_ the handler

<falafel>	knod, that's probably because you use tabs

<knod>	Some of it was my own fault. It made things stick out that I wanted to pay attention to, but it wasn't really presentable
<zumba_addict>	sorry, it was a quick code that I wrote
<zumba_addict>	let me fix
<falafel>	knod, maybe you can post a simpler example? Not sure what oyu mean tbh
<zumba_addict>	I've updated it , https://gist.github.com/c0debreaker/c167655af400b8be054f
<Agamemnus>	hello
<foofin>	Hello!
<zumba_addict>	I was wondering why this.remove() is like unknown
<Agamemnus>	I have a Q
<zumba_addict>	i forgot the error
<Agamemnus>	What would the name for a function be that removes a set of properties from an object using another object?
<knod>	falafel: is this more clear? http://pastebin.com/U5napxws
<Agamemnus>	for example:
<Agamemnus>	obj1 has cat, apple, dog, cow
<Agamemnus>	obj2 has apple, cow
<Agamemnus>	resulting obj3 has cat, dog
<falafel>	Agamemnus, difference?
<zumba_addict>	>> obj1 = ['cat','apple','dog','cow']
<ecmabot>	zumba_addict: (object) ['cat', 'apple', 'dog', 'cow']
<knod>	That's what I was thinking
<zumba_addict>	Agamemnus: use lodash for it :D
<knod>	maybe objDifference? Or propertyDifference? That's a complicated concept, lol
<falafel>	knod, importjs is async
<Agamemnus>	Hmm
<zumba_addict>	so guys, no answer for my question above?
<Agamemnus>	remove_identicals
<Agamemnus>	remove_same_properties
<knod>	falafel: Ok, got it, I need to make the completed list on the inside. I think
<cjohnson>	yes
<cjohnson>	you also need to *use* it on the inside
<knod>	Ok, got it
<knod>	Agamemnus: Do you remove the properties of the other objects?
<falafel>	zumba_addict, is that ES6?
<zumba_addict>	just regular javascript
<Agamemnus>	a new object is created
<zumba_addict>	i'm correcting the code now in console
<falafel>	zumba_addict, doesn't look like valid syntax then
<Agamemnus>	shit
<zumba_addict>	really, it's a regular javascript
<zumba_addict>	one sec, i'm fixing it
<falafel>	zumba_addict, what this? https://gist.github.com/c0debreaker/c167655af400b8be054f
<falafel>	line 5 is wrong
<Agamemnus>	create_object_with_nonidentical_properties_of_two_other_objects
<zumba_addict>	yup, i'm correcting it now
<falafel>	Agamemnus, what's wrong with difference?
<zumba_addict>	it was kinda pseudo
<Agamemnus>	too vague
<zumba_addict>	i was more worried about the this.remove()
<falafel>	not vague, general
<zumba_addict>	one sec
<Agamemnus>	too general/vague
<knod>	getNonOverlappingProperties?
<Agamemnus>	that's better
<falafel>	well, with arrays it is called difference in lodash, underscore and many other libs, with objects it is the same idea, it is general, then use a general name, that's the point of abstractions
<cjohnson>	!this @ zumba_addict
<ecmabot>	zumba_addict: If a function call is of the form `a.b()`, `this` will be the object you accessed the "b" property from.

<zumba_addict>	k
<zumba_addict>	I'll have to read that many times tonight :D thanks cj3kim
<cjohnson>	no matter what, this is how it works^ so if you aren't calling someFunction as obj.someFunction() where obj is the object you're returning here, then this is not what you think it is
<zumba_addict>	thanks cjohnson
<cjohnson>	no prob
<zumba_addict>	i've updated it and the code is working now - https://gist.github.com/c0debreaker/c167655af400b8be054f
<zumba_addict>	however, how to fix the this.remove there?
<falafel>	zumba_addict, `this` will depend on how someFunction is called, you called it like `someFunction()`, see? no dot, no `this`
<zumba_addict>	got it. How should I call it?
<falafel>	zumba_addict, someFunction.call(this)
<zumba_addict>	ah
<zumba_addict>	let me try :)
<zumba_addict>	gheez, i'm about to exit the train since i'm tethered to the phone
<falafel>	brb
<zumba_addict>	what's wrong? https://gist.github.com/c0debreaker/c167655af400b8be054f

<Wulf>	I'm using XMLHttpRequest to retrieve something. This can be a JPEG image or a JSON document. If it's the image, I'd to receive it as blob. If it's JSON, I'd like to get it as js object. How can I implement this?
<stelt_>	I'm trying to introduce D3 on a certain 'web'system, where files uploaded together (e.g. HTML and JSON) are according to the GUI in the same folder, but in reality don't have the same path. Via some javascript I can calculate the full URL for each of the files names. Where can I put this knowledge to generic use, aka override anything using XHR?
<larkable[NE]>	knod: I've tried to google it and have looked at about every stackoverflow there is. I don't think I understand it enough to Google it any further.
<knod>	larkable[NE]: sorry, it was my best guess for a quick fix :/
<knod>	larkable[NE]: the only other suggestion I have is to use regex, but I'm not experienced with this stuff
<knod>	larkable[NE]: what specifically did you search for?
<larkable[NE]>	"javascript return partial match" "javascript array return partial match" "indexof array"
<larkable[NE]>	I should mention that I've got it where it searches each key press, I don't know if that changes anything.
<knod>	larkable[NE]: Ok, so you're not interested in a pre-existing library for searching for things
<knod>	?
<knod>	larkable[NE]: That was my suggestion. If you're talking about a different suggestion, maybe you've got me mixed up with someone.
<larkable[NE]>	You mean script already designed for searching? I am, if it tailors specifically to what I need.
<knod>	larkable[NE]: I don't know anything about this stuff, I was just suggesting that a library might already exist for this and you could at least see how they did it.
<larkable[NE]>	unfortunately, I've tried implementing several results from stackoverflow to no avail
<knod>	larkable[NE]: Sorry, that sucks
<knod>	Maybe put up some of your attempts on jsfiddle and someone more experienced can take a look
<serapath>	is anyone aware of something that enables "typed visual components"? I'd like to inject a component into another component, so that array data passed to the latter uses the former to render each item

<cjohnson>	tompaw: they're both pointing to the same object, as you specified on line 6
<cjohnson>	>> var foo = {foo: 'foo'}; var bar = foo; bar.foo = 'bar'; foo;
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: (object) {foo: 'bar'}

<cjohnson>	= doesn't copy objects, it only copies the reference to them
<tompaw>	cjohnson: that's what I thought, thanks for clearing it out for me.
<cjohnson>	Dexx1_: http://underscorejs.org/#template
<cjohnson>	tompaw: you can use Object.assign if you want to clone an object
<tompaw>	now, is there a way to force a copy?
<tompaw>	lol
<tompaw>	cjohnson: thx ;)
<cjohnson>	it's available in es6, which you'll have to use es6-shim for
<cjohnson>	!es6-shim
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: Use https://www.npmjs.com/package/es6-shim to get every backwards-compatible feature of ES6 in every browser and node.js! It's heavily tested, comes with Promises, and requires the !es5-shim.
<cjohnson>	>> var foo = {foo: 'foo'}; var bar = Object.assign({}, foo); bar.foo = 'bar'; foo;
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: TypeError: Object.assign is not a function
<cjohnson>	well, that's how you'd do it if ecmabot had es6 :)
<cjohnson>	bar becomes a copy of foo in that instance
<tompaw>	so, what you're saying is there is not equivalent in raw js?
<cjohnson>	Object.assign is raw js :)
<cjohnson>	b> var foo = {foo: 'foo'}; var bar = Object.assign({}, foo); bar.foo = 'bar'; foo;
<babelbot>	cjohnson: { foo: 'foo' }
<cjohnson>	babelbot supports es6
<cjohnson>	es6 is the next "version" of javascript. most current browsers support es5.1
<tompaw>	ah, i see, so this fancy shmancy -shim is what you might call a glimpse into the future?
<cjohnson>	es6-shim is a polyfill which backports some of the new features onto older javascripts, namely es5
<cjohnson>	exactly
<tompaw>	and if I add it to my app, will jquery, angularjs and bootstrap collapse like a house of cards set on napalm fire?
<cjohnson>	nope, the only code that would be bothered by it would be code that (badly) modifies the Object or Array prototypes (or similar)
<cjohnson>	which none of those projects, nor most major projects, do
<tompaw>	cool, I shall give it a try, then.
<tompaw>	cjohnson: thanks for your time!
<cjohnson>	no prob!
<Dexx1_>	cjohnson: I don't get what I am doing wrong. The template shows up, but the "open dialog" box from open() doesn't: http://pastie.org/private/oalzhcdvelejchcbls0zca
<cjohnson>	I don't understand what exactly you're doing
<cjohnson>	_.template(foo) expects foo to be a string, and then it returns a function
<cjohnson>	that you can later call with the data for the template
<cjohnson>	_.template("hello: <%= name %>")({name: 'bob'})  would return the compiled template with the given data
<cjohnson>	so you're for some reason trying to store the function (this.template) as a string in a node on line 26
<isaac_rks>	anyone have a link to a good tutorial on organising JS code?
<cjohnson>	oh nvm you're calling it as a function, that's right
<cjohnson>	still I'm not sure exactly what this code is doing
<stelt_>	cjohnson, problem is a bit different. A web system you can upload files to that than seem to be in the same folder (as expected), but in reality have a different URLpath. In JavaScript I can figure out the translation from filename to actual full URL. Now I want to turn that into a JS drop-in to put in the top of every HTML file to fix every XHR call from every library automagically. How to?
<cjohnson>	can't
<cjohnson>	if they're using XHR directly and not using your wrapper, you will have to translate the URLs at whatever feeds the URLs to the code
<Dexx1_>	cjohnson: you can call _.template("hello: <%= name %>")({name: 'bob'}) in render() ?

<Grokling>	I'm working through some password hashing stuff at the moment.
<Grokling>	The current planned flow is (password) => (hashing algorithm) => {interwebs} => (server comparison against stored hash).
<Grokling>	Communication will be via ssl.
<Grokling>	I want to hash the password on the client so that the server/internet has no possible way of acquiring the plaintext password (without tampering with the client, or breaking the hash)
<Grokling>	This is one of those annoying cases where 'good enough' isn't good enough, and we need to demonstrate that every reasonable effort has been made, so I'm looking at hashing using scrypt.
<Grokling>	I've played a little with scrypt-async (https://github.com/dchest/scrypt-async-js/), but that seems to output a key rather than a hash.
<Grokling>	Can anyone suggest a library that will do what I need? (or an alternate approach?)
<b4b>	deltab: what browser/os?
<larkable[NE]>	knod: I got it. Lol. I wasn't running a for loop like I should have been.
<knod>	larkable[NE]: glad to hear it :)
<deltab>	b4b: firefox, linux
<b4b>	i blame that combo, js shouldnt be able to crash a browser
<deltab>	ordinarily it doesn't
<Grokling>	So, nobody knows about client side scrypt hashing in javascript?
*	Grokling is either on the bleeding edge, or way off track..
<b4b>	does anyone here have a decent android or iphone and willing to help me get http://webchars.com close to 60fps?
<b4b>	runs great on the ipad but lags like shit on my android
<j201>	Grokling: that would require serving all of your resources over https to be secure, and if you're doing that, you might as well just depend on ssl to protect the password
<PotPlant_>	^
<Grokling>	j201, yes, I'll be serving everything over ssl, so not so worried about the hashing algorithm being interfered with. The aim is to avoid the "user" password ever reaching my server. I realise that generating a hash on the client side makes the hash effectively the password, and I'm fine with that. Because no user is going to use that hash in multiple places.
<j201>	Grokling: why?
<Grokling>	j201 unreasonable paranoia. (not mine)
<j201>	well, that's why nobody does it ;) (also, you'll still have to salt/hash on the server too)
<AirStar>	hello, i want make card game on my web site with javascript. there is a tutorial?
<Grokling>	The data I'm dealing with is 'sensitive', and we need to demonstrate an appropriate level of security mindedness.
<Grokling>	j201, yes, I was planning to re-hash the clientside hash on the server as well.
<j201>	well, file it under "mostly harmless wastes of time to make management happy"
<Grokling>	I have no idea how you'd find a market for information about when I had my tonsils out, or the fact that my left foot is half a size bigger than my right, but people seem quite afraid that health information might end up being compromised!

<cr0mulent>	deltab: Is the second set of parenthesis essentially the parameters for what is being called by require?
<maja>	whats the best way to make sure a function complets before continuing ?
<sabrehagen>	maja: is your function asynchronous?
<deltab>	<script src=...></script> <script src=...></script> is sequential, yes
<sabrehagen>	deltab: i was unaware, thanks
<maja>	deltab: i don't think so

<maja>	not in relation to javascript
<deltab>	maja: hi. I'm not sure what you mean
<sabrehagen>	maja: what environment are you working in?
<deltab>	ah
<maja>	sabrehagen: jquerygo its nodejs interface to phantomjs
<deltab>	cr0mulent: it seems that the knex module exports a function; you're calling that function with the database config

<maja>	what i want todo is
<maja>	  fillinform(cfg.dataShipping),function(){
<maja>	  console.log('hkafljafljas');
<sabrehagen>	maja: principally i would suggest promises, but i am not familiar with how node and phantom interact, so it may not be applicable
<deltab>	cr0mulent: rquivalent to  var f = require('knex'), knex = f(DBConfig');

<msafi>	I have about 33 JavaScript files in my source code and when I run grunt-babel or gulp-babel on them it takes more than 2 seconds to compile. Is this normal? 2 seconds seems like a long time if I setup a watcher?
<falafel>	msafi, are you using browserify? or is this for node>
<msafi>	falafel: I'm trying to compile my ES6 files before giving them to the browser
<falafel>	msafi, I use watchify with  babelify and everything compiles fast
<falafel>	and I have about 20+ files
<msafi>	falafel: how does this work, watchify and babelify? are they node modules?
<falafel>	msafi, yeah, I have something like that in my gulpfile http://dpaste.com/1G4979M
<msafi>	I don't use Browserify
<falafel>	msafi, why not if you are targeting the browser...
<NBhosting>	when ussing var gamedata = [];
<NBhosting>	how do i do this correctly
<NBhosting>	gamedata.push([count:data.count,player:data.player,pos:data.pos]);
<falafel>	msafi, watchify will save you some time, as it only recompiles what's necessary when it is necessary
<msafi>	falafel: I never understood the point of Browserify? Like I never had a problem where I thought, oh I wish I could get this npm on the browser
<NBhosting>	it pushes multiple rows of data
<falafel>	msafi, so you never look for packages on npm for the browser? YOu are missing on a lot of good stuff
<deltab>	NBhosting: { } not [ ]
<falafel>	msfbut htat's not the only point, the point of Browserify is to use common modules
<NBhosting>	k
<NBhosting>	thanks, im still to much python :D:D
<deltab>	NBhosting: spaces after , and : would make that more readable, btw
<falafel>	msafi, what are you using to load your packages in the browser then?
<msafi>	falafel: usually Grunt. For development workflows it inserts <script> tags. For production builds it processes all files into one and inserts a single <script> tag.
<falafel>	msafi, ah, that's kind of unfortunate...
<msafi>	falafel: why?
<falafel>	msafi, no modules, just plain old concatenation...
<msafi>	falafel: you're still not telling me why...
<msafi>	I really don't see what benefit I'm missing...
<falafel>	msafi, if you are missing on modular code, are you littering your code with IIFEs then?
<msafi>	No, I use Angular and it handles dependency injection for me.
<msafi>	falafel: so you develop in the browser without a framework?
<msafi>	falafel: just a bunch of modules that you manage through browserify?
<falafel>	msafi, ANgular changed all of that for 2.0 anywat, it switched to actual modules
<falafel>	msafi, there are frameworks on npm
<falafel>	msafi, the point of doing this is using common modules
<msafi>	falafel: how does Angular 2 work?
<falafel>	msafi, modules and transpiler
<msafi>	falafel: I heard it doesn't really require a transpiler. Everything can be written in ES5 without losing features.
<falafel>	msafi, I guess you could, but again, modules are king, concatenating, angular 1.x "modules" etc, are at this point a waste of time IMO
<falafel>	since all of that is going away, modules are here to stay, and all new libs are using modules
<falafel>	it is about interoperability as well
<robdubya>	msafi if you're doing angular2, you want to do it in es6 (you actually want to do it in typescript)
<falafel>	once you setup browserify it is all set, and you can move your gulpfile around. I mean, my gulp file is reusable, just have to change the paths
<msafi>	falafel: why is your gulpfile in the browser?
<falafel>	msafi, what?
<falafel>	it is not, is in my project folder, just like a grunt file
<msafi>	falafel: oh okay, I misread that
<msafi>	falafel: so how is your gulpfile related to browserify?
<falafel>	msafi, it uses browserify and babelify, like in the script I posted
<falafel>	it builds the project, and watches files, etc
<falafel>	grunt is slower in general, and concatenating is slower vs watchify
<falafel>	think that you are concatenating 30+ files everytime you transpile the code
<falafel>	watchify is smarter than that, it knows not to recompile everything if nothing changed
<falafel>	and with modules you get an actual dependency graph, not just a bunch of files from random folders
<msafi>	falafel: so I do everything in Angular today. Say I wanted to use Browserify, where would it make sense to use it?
<falafel>	msafi, angular is on npm afaik.
<robdubya>	i'd also look into systemJS while you're at it
<falafel>	this looks like a good starting point http://blog.npmjs.org/post/114584444410/using-angulars-new-improved-browserify-support
<falafel>	msafi, ^
<falafel>	but with angular 2 they use TypeScript anyway, so if you are going to update any time soon, whenever it becomes official, I'd rather use whatever they recommend
<falafel>	I mean, that's the point of a framework after all. If you are using Angular 1.x now, just go with it, browserify may be an option, but if what you got works for you, do all of this next time
<falafel>	try switching your current build to gulp, it may be noticeably faster than grunt
<msafi>	I'm using Gulp. It's just as slow as Grunt. Apparently my configurations for both is wrong. I'll look into a way to make it only process changed files.
<falafel>	msafi, don't know then, maybe there is some plugin for caching, I know browserify provides this

<ljharb>	fullstack: if you need " in a double quoted string, you need `\"` in the string.
<inimino>	falafel: all that stuff is so new it's probably just a bug
<falafel>	inimino, I looked in the bug reports, nothing found, i tis weird nobody reported this if it is indeed a bug, and not me using it badly
<ljharb>	it's way too soon to use ES6 modules.
<ljharb>	the loader spec isn't even finished yet.

<inimino>	how do you like jspm?

<fullstack>	ljharb, are you an op here in ##javascript too?
<inimino>	so \" -> "\\\"" -> '\\\\\\"'
<ljharb>	fullstack: nope
<fullstack>	inimino, thanks for your help. \\\\\\" wasn't 100% obvious to me. its like in those css tutorial videos where the guy "does something real quick" inbetween all the steps that only he would know after 10+ years of experience and skips over it like, duh everyone knows that, but it isn't obvious
<fullstack>	"and thats how you 3d shadow box the absolute margin headers!"
<inimino>	fullstack: yeah, fair point
<inimino>	There's a term for that effect.
<inimino>	the "curse of knowledge"
<GreenJello>	*cough* monads *cough*
<GreenJello>	but also, the problem with video tutorials is if you go over all of CSS in them, they'd all be 60 hours long :-)
<GreenJello>	in text posts, you can link to prerequisite knowledge sources easily
<fullstack>	my problem is if I spend 30-40 hours doing CSS, I forget promises syntax
<fullstack>	And if I do anything other then CSS, I forget 100% of it. Haha
<GreenJello>	I have very poor memory, but eventually these things stuck for me
<fullstack>	I'm looking into writing my own repetitive memory CSS course with mobile app memriser
<isaac_rks>	I thank God every day I'm not indians
<GreenJello>	but I probably couldn't keep web and C++ in my head at once, for example
<isaac_rks>	I can do all things because I'm not a greasy indian
<fullstack>	Oh I've totally forgotten C++. That and regex. I have to basically start off again in 1st grade whenever I need to do a complex regex.
<fullstack>	pthreads, you can throw that out the window. (shit I better remove that off my resume)

<surianup>	Hi Devs
<surianup>	How are you all?
<GreenJello>	fullstack, I remember the rexex basics like I can do addition, but a lot of it is like calculus to me (I could learn it again, but painfully)
<fullstack>	surianup, good.
*	inimino sets ban on isaac_rks!*@*
<surianup>	I need a suggestion from you guys for creation a javascript tool for draggable polygon and I will use that on the google map
<surianup>	like this http://www.apartments.com/?sk=39d3a6ecc3e4d4a84310d27dd3df22fa&bb=62z8v3q_0Jx91tpgN
*	inimino sets ban on *!*@202-78-146-9.cable.telstraclear.net
<surianup>	please click on the polygon and the draw a polygon over bing map over the site
*	inimino removes channel operator status from inimino
<GreenJello>	it looks like it's basically a drawing app on a transparent canvas over the top of the map, and then they take the points on that and translate it to google maps shapes
*	deathonater is now known as knives
<GreenJello>	or it could be: map, svg overlay, div overlay drawing surface
*	knives is now known as deathonater
<surianup>	GreenJello I don't know very wast knowlefge about javascript
<surianup>	that why I am asking to you buddy
<GreenJello>	surianup, it's not a trivial task, maybe you can find something premade
<surianup>	yes buddy know it not a east task at all
<surianup>	but I have to do buddy
<surianup>	I need some ideas only I will be done this task
<surianup>	I have followed the google api but not a proper things there https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/polygon-draggable
<surianup>	https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/polygon-autoclose
<surianup>	https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/polygon-arrays
<GreenJello>	yep, that's the final step: drawing it onto the map
<GreenJello>	you aren't asking for draggable polygons, you're asking for *drawable* polygons
<surianup>	in this site
<surianup>	http://www.apartments.com/?sk=39d3a6ecc3e4d4a84310d27dd3df22fa&bb=62z8v3q_0Jx91tpgN
<surianup>	is it a drawable polygons?
<GreenJello>	yeah
<surianup>	GreenJello
<surianup>	, what is the very first step here?
<surianup>	to create a drawable tool?
<GreenJello>	yeah
<surianup>	afer that?
<surianup>	after that?
<GreenJello>	take the drawn polygon, and convert the data into a google maps polygon
<GreenJello>	and anything after that you haven't mentioned
<surianup>	how is is possible brother, first I have create a tool and the after I have use the pure mathematics?
<surianup>	I think
<GreenJello>	maybe, I don't know much about the google maps stuff
<surianup>	to find the vertices vertex, points
<surianup>	very fucking stuff is this
<surianup>	becasue I from the PHP side
<surianup>	do not much knowledge about js
<asteele>	its pretty advanced math for anyone i think
<asteele>	i would pray theres a lib out there that can do the hard stuff for you
<asteele>	the tool you linked is impressively accurate, i have like squiggleys and stuff all over and criss crossing my own trails, and it returned perfect results
<surianup>	asteele can you help me to make this impossible to possible?
<asteele>	nope
<surianup>	:)
<surianup>	hehehe
<asteele>	sorry :p
<asteele>	would need to pay me for that one
<surianup>	ohhh
<surianup>	I am also a developer working in a company
<surianup>	and they have gave me that task brother
<surianup>	can you give me some ideas?
<surianup>	how to make this
<asteele>	i would inspect what they are doing and google a lot
<surianup>	http://www.apartments.com/?sk=39d3a6ecc3e4d4a84310d27dd3df22fa&bb=62z8v3q_0Jx91tpgN

<tejasmanohar>	anyone here familiar w/ bluebird lib?
<tejasmanohar>	https://gist.github.com/tejasmanohar/5530c98d650156c30cbc
<tejasmanohar>	#map returns an array and .forEach should iterate over that but its reporting that a promise is being returned instead
<boar>	Oh, I can help with this one
<tejasmanohar>	thanks boar
<boar>	You need two main things, a method that tracks the mouse and creates the points of the path
<tejasmanohar>	oh nvm
<boar>	Oh, sorry, talking to surianup
<tejasmanohar>	rekt :P
<boar>	=*(
<boar>	And second of all surianup, you need a way to fill everything inside that polygon
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: promises always return promises.
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: you can't get a value out of a promise.
<tejasmanohar>	oh ok sorry, bad wording
<boar>	surianup: for filling a polygon you're going to have to do some research, for example: http://ezekiel.vancouver.wsu.edu/~cs442/archive/lectures/raster/polyfill/poly.pdf
<tejasmanohar>	ljharb: what is this error trying to tell me then? and do you know what the issue is? forEach should take an arr, guess i want to pass each item of the result of map there
<surianup>	thanks buddy boar
<boar>	surianup: It looks like they're using an overlay for that polygon, it doesn't load with the google maps nor does it pixelate
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: what would "forEach" or "map" do on a promise.
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: forEach and map are functions on Array.prototype.
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: all those things have to be inside a .then
<fooey>	who do people use for hosting node/io apps? I'm super bummed that Heroku is looking at getting rid of their free tier =(
<tejasmanohar>	oh true, not bluebird / promise methods
<tejasmanohar>	should be in .then
<tejasmanohar>	yeah
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: right. it's best to avoid anything but the ES6 standard methods, even when using bluebird.
<tejasmanohar>	well .map is a part of bbird
<tejasmanohar>	ljharb: why?
<tejasmanohar>	isnt that a reason to use bbird
<ljharb>	because then your promise lib isn't easily changeable.
<ljharb>	the reason to use bluebird is its performance. the convenience methods aren't really worth it imo.
<ljharb>	you should be able to swap out bluebird, native promises, q, etc and have all your code work the same.
<tejasmanohar>	oh hm ok
<tejasmanohar>	but https://gist.github.com/tejasmanohar/5530c98d650156c30cbc#file-drawcontroller-js-L30 should solve the actual problem at hand, right? ljharb
<tejasmanohar>	bbird.map vs using es6 standards always is a preference
<ljharb>	true indeed
<ljharb>	i don't know how try/map works in bluebird tho.
<tejasmanohar>	but yeah ill have to consider that, i guess it makes it more modular. sure, the map doesn't error- i used it earlier, i just got a little crazy there with the forEach
<ljharb>	but also, line 30 needs to return something, otherwise the promise will be resolved with undefined.
<tejasmanohar>	oops my bad
<tejasmanohar>	hm, return csv.write(line)
<tejasmanohar>	csvStream but yea
<ljharb>	assuming that returns something.
<tejasmanohar>	looking
<tejasmanohar>	hm i guess not https://github.com/iojs/readable-stream/blob/master/lib/_stream_transform.js#L142
<tejasmanohar>	ljharb: can i just return; or do i actually have to return something w/ promises
<tejasmanohar>	not accepting a function param on the following .finally() or .then() so guessing return; should be fine
<ljharb>	you can return any value. but note how write takes a callback?
<ljharb>	in that case you should return a promise.
<ljharb>	(oh also your forEach is broken, "line" isn't defined)
<tejasmanohar>	yea my bad
<ljharb>	so like, `return arr.map(function (line) { new Promise(function (resolve, reject) { csvStream.write(line, function (err, result) { if (err) { reject(err); } else { resolve(result); } }); }); });`
<ljharb>	ie, you want to convert the array of lines, to an array of promises for "written lines"
<surianup>	boar
<ljharb>	even better, `return Promise.all(arr.map…)`
<ljharb>	so you can return a single promise that .then can lift.
<surianup>	boar  then what is your suggestion to me
<tejasmanohar>	Promise.all(arr.map) ? i thought the .map is fine as is
<tejasmanohar>	forEach, ljharb ?
<falafel>	tejasmanohar, arr.map(...)
<falafel>	tejasmanohar, Promise.all takes an array of promises
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: no, app.map returns an array.
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: Promise.all lets the promise resolve to an array of *results* instead of an array of promises.
<fullstack>	another tip don't break any promises or make any promises you can't keep
<tejasmanohar>	ljharb: oh i see, one sec
<boar>	surianup: Not sure, Haven't tried doing this before in javascript. Take a look for a drawing library and overlay it ontop of the googlemaps div
<boar>	surianup: Then, transform all contents in that drawing library based on the googlemaps resolution / scale
<surianup>	ok thanks brother
<boar>	And pass events from the overlay onto the googlemaps part
<boar>	I'm not sure if its the best way, but it sounds like it'll get super complicated super fast
<boar>	surianup: Yeah, looking at their html layout and it looks like they've used an overlay
<surianup>	have you looking appaertment.com?
<surianup>	are you looking at surianup: Yeah, looking at their html layout and it looks like they've used an overlay
<surianup>	are you looking at appaertment.com

<Agamemnus>	anyone alive right now
<Agamemnus>	foofin are you a bot?
<Agamemnus>	hello
<tejasmanohar>	ljharb: i dont see why you'd prefer return Promise.all(arr.map(... // all of that again
<tejasmanohar>	over https://gist.github.com/tejasmanohar/5530c98d650156c30cbc#file-drawcontroller-js-L30
<tejasmanohar>	maybe im missing something?
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: because it's standard.
<ljharb>	standard is much much better than "slightly shorter".
<Agamemnus>	hello
<foofin>	Hello!
<Agamemnus>	foofin is a Hello bot.
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: oh nvm
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: you're asking why Promise.all
<Agamemnus>	Well, I suppose it brightens by day.
<boar>	hell
<Agamemnus>	my day*
<boar>	hello
<foofin>	Hello!
<tejasmanohar>	yeah
<boar>	Foofin is best bot
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: because without Promise.all, you've got a promise of "an array of promises". with it, you've got a promise of "an array of *results*"
<Agamemnus>	Ok, I need some help. I have a strange bug.
<tejasmanohar>	oh
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: ie, in the former case, you need to use .then() on everything in the array.
<Agamemnus>	After a few minutes, my character movement animations disappear somehow
<Agamemnus>	like 3 minutes
<Agamemnus>	just go to http://flyingsoft.pw/projects/a_mixin_good_time/ , hide it, then wait 3-4 minutes, then tab back in
<Agamemnus>	then click to move the character
<Agamemnus>	the animation dies
<Agamemnus>	i don't understand why. I think it's a bug related to my rapid opacity changing on the other divs? Any ideas?

<Agamemnus>	this is in chrome canary
<lite_>	>>> moment()

<Agamemnus>	i am temporarily disabling the opacity
<greves>	not really sure where to ask this... if i want to do search result highlighting, is that going be javascript or css or...? i've got the filtered results on the screen, and the keyword
<tejasmanohar>	thanks. ljharb, other than the bluebird map vs arr.prototype.map thing, do you have any suggestions/critique on this https://gist.github.com/tejasmanohar/5530c98d650156c30cbc ?
<falafel>	greves, both
<ljharb>	greves: possibly only css, if the html is server-rendered.
<tejasmanohar>	or it looks ok to you
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: the Promise.try also
<ljharb>	and .finally.
<falafel>	greves, you can wrap the words in a <span class="highlight">word</span>
<greves>	html is client side, the server is just serving JSON via REST API
<falafel>	with JS
<tejasmanohar>	ljharb: es6 promise doesnt have finally() or try() ?
<ljharb>	no
<greves>	hmmm ok
<greves>	not exactly sure where to do that :D
<tejasmanohar>	oh ok
<Agamemnus>	Ok, it definitely has something to do with opacity.
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: also you can make a function to wrap lines 31-38. also you forgot a "return" on line 31.
<Agamemnus>	Any ideas on this?
<GreenJello>	greves, the way you do it is very much based on what libraries/frameworks you're using
<RLa>	is github slow for others too atm?
<greves>	GreenJello, yeah, of course - i'm trying to think of how to do that in my react component that contains the search results
<Agamemnus>	github is fast for me
<RLa>	status page shows everything to be perfect
<tejasmanohar>	ljharb: wouldnt it be 31-40?
<Agamemnus>	this seems to be a canary bug.
<Agamemnus>	:((((((((((((((((((
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: no
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: ie, make a function that takes "line" and returns a promise.
<GreenJello>	greves, split the string into an array like [{text: 'Cool ', type: 'normal'}, {text: 'widgets', type: 'highlight'}, {...}]
<GreenJello>	and then .map over it in render and determine how to display each .text depending on the .type
<greves>	GreenJello, won't that be quite excessive if i've got many thousands (10-100k) words in my results?
<tejasmanohar>	ljharb: you mean like an un-nested function? there's already a function, its the param to arr.map?
<GreenJello>	greves, that's a lot of words
<falafel>	pagination...
<GreenJello>	greves, that's probably more words than I read in a day
<greves>	falafel, yeah i've got pagination but there's a 'show all' option
<greves>	that option already takes about ~5 seconds to render
<GreenJello>	'show all' -> 'pretend to show all', i.e. infinite scrolling
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: yes. like an un-nested one.
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: anything you can put in a small pure function, do.
<greves>	GreenJello, unfortunately that complicates things quite a bit for my purposes. that's ok, i'll just try what you're suggesting and see if i can tweak it a bit ;)
<tejasmanohar>	like so? ljharb
<tejasmanohar>	https://gist.github.com/tejasmanohar/5530c98d650156c30cbc#file-drawcontroller-js-L42
<ljharb>	yep, exactly
<Kartagis>	how can I see the effects of js modifications I made on the console? hitting F5 reloads the page and all my modifications are gone
<ljharb>	Kartagis: make your modifications in the real files then hit refresh.
<Kartagis>	ljharb: there's no other way?
<ljharb>	you can try chrome's "live edit" stuff, but you can't refresh and keep your changes unless they're coming from the server.
<moep>	Morning
<fooey>	Kartagis, if you have a smallish thing you're playing with, try something like JSFiddle.net
<Kartagis>	http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/b42bmL0o/ why do I have to use innerHTML twice here? 27 and 30
<falafel>	that's a weird mix of jQuery + DOM
<falafel>	might as well use all jquery if you have it already
<lite_>	ljharb: i figured it out. It appears we're using and old version of momentjs and I was looking at the API for the latest one. Turns out some time ago reversed their parameters from add('seconds, '30') to .add(30, 'seconds')
<falafel>	except for the thing you use jquery for, the $.each, use forEach for that
<tejasmanohar>	https://gist.github.com/tejasmanohar/377843b829fd3af47fcb#file-gistfile1-js-L87
<tejasmanohar>	i see "test 1" printed to console
<tejasmanohar>	not "test 2"
<tejasmanohar>	trying to find out what the error couldve been in between
<tejasmanohar>	but unsure
<Nazral>	how is it possible that var t =[]; console.log(t == []); returns false ?
<falafel>	>>[]===[] @ Nazral
<ecmabot>	Nazral: (boolean) false
<Nazral>	so....
<Nazral>	why ?
<falafel>	Nazral, two arrays are two different objects
<tejasmanohar>	>> o = {}; o2 = {}; o===o2
<ecmabot>	tejasmanohar: (boolean) false
<Nazral>	ok ok
<GreenJello>	Nazral, equality is by reference, not value
<GreenJello>	except for primitives
<falafel>	you'd have to compare each element of the array
<Kartagis>	so...
<ljharb>	lite_: ah, makes sense
<tejasmanohar>	anyone know any potential reasons why the second console.log isnt printed?
<Kartagis>	why do I have to use innerHTML twice there?

<tejasmanohar>	oh oops was replacing findOneAndUpdate
<tejasmanohar>	ok one sec
<tejasmanohar>	yeah .exec same as find
<fooey>	Kartagis, i dont' get what you're asking, your innerHTML's are all for different elements

<tejasmanohar>	updated the gist https://gist.github.com/tejasmanohar/377843b829fd3af47fcb ljharb - its right syntax now as far as i can tell but still no "test 2"
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: how are you running this file
<Kartagis>	fooey: I know it works, but I'm just wondering what's with the innerHTML
<tejasmanohar>	ljharb: `node test.js`
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: btw console.err isn't a thing, you want console.error.
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: so what do you get in the console?
<tejasmanohar>	nothing
<tejasmanohar>	it doesnt hang, it just ends shortly
<ljharb>	everything in the file is a noop except the Draw.findOne
<ljharb>	but, it should work. if it's not, that's an issue with mongoose
<tejasmanohar>	ljharb: yeah i get nothing https://gist.github.com/tejasmanohar/377843b829fd3af47fcb
<tejasmanohar>	oh got it
<tejasmanohar>	didnt require my database config, still surprised no errors O.o
<NBhosting>	whats an easy way to get the reverse number from 1 to 24  ,  so if i input 1 it should give 24 and when i input 24 it should be 1
<ljharb>	NBhosting: 24 - n?
<NBhosting>	what n?
<NBhosting>	whats
<ljharb>	whatever the input is
<NBhosting>	ah idd
<NBhosting>	that simple
<falafel>	24 - n + 1
<tejasmanohar>	ljharb: https://gist.github.com/tejasmanohar/377843b829fd3af47fcb#file-gistfile1-js-L33 - im trying to create the file, of course the file/dir doesnt exist?
<ljharb>	then you'd have to make it first
<ljharb>	use mkdirp
<tejasmanohar>	oh ok ill look at that
<tejasmanohar>	wait fs.mkdirAsync("tickets"); ?
<ljharb>	?
<tejasmanohar>	isnt that MAKING the directory?
<ljharb>	use require('mkdirp')
<ljharb>	and yes
<ljharb>	mkdirp is an npm package.
<tejasmanohar>	yes but why wouldnt this work O.o
<fooey>	fs-extra is a handy module for that too
<falafel>	mkdirAsync?
<falafel>	did you mean mkdirSync?
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: if the path basename doesn't exist you can't write to the file
<tejasmanohar>	oh mkdirp made things simpler
<tuskkk___>	why isnt console.log working above that dialog? http://jsfiddle.net/e9xopu4m/2/
<falafel>	tuskkk___, you know about `var`?
<tuskkk___>	yes
<falafel>	ok, you should use it
<falafel>	also, that fiddle has an error in the console

<AirStar>	what is good ftp on mac?
<ljharb>	tuskkk___: what's "bootbox"
<tuskkk___>	ljharb: a dialog box, for yes and no
<ljharb>	tuskkk___: right but that variable isn't in the fiddle anywhere.
<ljharb>	falafel: what's the module export exactly?
<falafel>	ljharb, module.exports = {foo: function(){}, bla, bla, bla}
<falafel>	with Babel standalone it works

<falafel>	the destructuring with `import {foo} from 'baz'`
<tejasmanohar>	is there a syntax error here
<tejasmanohar>	i used a linter + when i run it
<ljharb>	falafel: p sure you can't use destructuring like that
<tejasmanohar>	and it keeps saying unexpected } but i cant identify it, i used a bracket highlighter
<tejasmanohar>	one l#62

<ljharb>	falafel: in other words, i think the reply is correct.
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: line 61.
<tejasmanohar>	) is to close promise all() and } the function param
<falafel>	ljharb, well, Babel compiles it to `var _require = require('baz'); var foo = _require.foo`
<tejasmanohar>	OH
<ljharb>	falafel: i'd never trust babel as the authority
<falafel>	ljharb, it is weird, because jspm uses Babel, so that's what I don't udnerstand
<ljharb>	falafel: but also, since the loader spec isn't written yet, and it's way too soon to use es6 modules ;-)
<ljharb>	falafel: i totally agree that they should work together consistently
<ljharb>	falafel: so either way there's a bug in jspm or babel. but, the only thing that matters is the spec.
<tejasmanohar>	i added )
<tejasmanohar>	but i dont get it,s till errors
<tejasmanohar>	https://gist.github.com/tejasmanohar/89f8b7efba28867a6911
<falafel>	I guess, interoperability with cjs modules is important, I'd say it should work, but we'll see what the spec says
<tejasmanohar>	it says on l#62 unexpected ; but like it looks like i closed each function with ()
<tejasmanohar>	and { } for body of fn's
<falafel>	tejasmanohar, just compy/paste in Vim, pressed =, I see a red character, meaning something is not right
<falafel>	have you tried jshint?
<falafel>	go bracket byu bracket, paren by paren, match it with your text editor, in Vim you'd use %

<nickysp>	Hi, I have a select with only 1 option. I have a onchange event triggered to the select. I am having problem when I first choose the item and the event is triggered, but then it won't because I already have the only option selected. I need to be able to "re-select" that option so the event occurs again. How can I do this?
<nickysp>	also is it possible to unselect an select if there is only one option? like it was at first before I choosed the option. I tried to set .select to false for the option but would not fix it
<ljharb>	the event is called "change".
<ljharb>	"onchange" is a legacy and crappy way to assign a single listener for "change".
<falafel>	why a select menu with only one item? seems to defeat the purpose of using it in the first place
<nickysp>	falafel: it's a dynamic select , when I choose the option I get a "modal" to create more items. But if I first choose the option, get the modal and take cancel and want to get the same modal back up again I can't.
<nickysp>	ljharb: I though onselect and select was the same event.
<greves>	anybody have a good solution for what to do if i've got ~100 tabs (with fairly short names)?
<falafel>	nickysp, seems like that is an issue with interaction then, I'd make a button to open the modal to create more options
<falafel>	that I think would be more intuitive
<greves>	i was thinking like stacked somehow, maybe 20-30 across and multiple rows of tabs
<nickysp>	falafel: yes, I could do that, but that is not what I asked for.
<nickysp>	must be able to "null it" as on start it has no option selected
<nickysp>	right?
<nickysp>	get it to it's initial state
<nickysp>	or to re-trigger the event, that must be possible
<GreenJello>	greves, two things I've seen: chrome shrinks them down until they're impossible to read, and most other programs show the number that fit, and then a dropdown with the rest at the end
<falafel>	nickysp, try the click event
<greves>	GreenJello, hmmm, well that won't work - i need them all visible
<GreenJello>	I had an editor that did wrapping, but there were just too many at that point
<greves>	i've actually seen it before somewhere but i forget where
<GreenJello>	and also I've seen them categorized into a tree, but anything is better than showing 100 tabs, because users can't make sense of it usually, especially if it's all text
<GreenJello>	but yeah, just make them inline-block and let it wrap if you need to do that
<GreenJello>	or maybe some flexbox trickery would be cool and let them take up the space nicely
<nickysp>	falafel: I am pretty sure there is no click event on options?
<falafel>	nickysp, http://jsfiddle.net/tb0ufg9z/
<nickysp>	could do on select and check what element was clicked, if it was an option or the select sure but seems like a big hack
<falafel>	yeah, that's what I meant
<greves>	GreenJello, nah the 100 tabs is actually fine, it's an alphabetical list of language codes, so pretty easy to navigate
<falafel>	it does look like a hack, like I said, it looks like not great UI
<greves>	de, en, es, fr, it, ...
<GreenJello>	greves, include flags :-)
<greves>	GreenJello, no can do - political reasons (serious)
<GreenJello>	I understand
<greves>	i'll try react-tabs and see how that comes out in the HTML and probably have to style it with some css to make them wrap, i guess
<GreenJello>	tab components are pretty simple; it's just rendering a list of things, and keeping one piece of state
*	michd is now known as MichD
<greves>	yeah
<GreenJello>	if you need to style it, a third party one is likely more trouble than it's worth
<greves>	hmmm, maybe..
<greves>	the stuff inside the tabs is pretty messy though, not sure if 3rd party one makes that easier or harder hahaha
<GreenJello>	that's unrelated to the tabs :-)
<GreenJello>	<Tabs items={xs} selected={index} onChange={handleTabClick} />
<greves>	well i basically need a <ul> with a list of tabs, then a bunch of <div>s, and show one <div> based on the selected tab, right?
*	MichD is now known as michd
<nickysp>	falafel: with your code, you have no way to determine if the select was clicked or the option
<nickysp>	falafel: the evt.target will be the select
<falafel>	nickysp, mmm, in Chrome it only triggers when you show the dropdown and click an option, not when you click on the select
<falafel>	it triggers if you click, the dropdown shows, then click again
<nickysp>	nah, I am using chrome and I get double trigger
<falafel>	must be inconsistent then, I get one trigger only when I click an option
<falafel>	Chrome 42 on linux
<falafel>	nickysp, I think your best bet if you want that behavior is to make your own select
<nickysp>	falafel: yes I am afraid so :(
<cockatrice>	Hello! Would anyone be able to tell me why a module is loading on desktop but not on mobile? Or know how to find out? Currently testing the problematic app at http://76.10.42.210:9000

<fullstack>	errr. is there a quick map/filter/forEach hack to do OrderBy of a key-value of array? without lodash?
<cockatrice>	fullstack: Array.sort() ?
<fullstack>	can I sort on a specific key?
<cockatrice>	That accepts a comparator function so you can do whatever you want with the arguments, including looking at their keys.
<fullstack>	ah thats right thanks
<cockatrice>	e.g. dict.sort(function(a,b) {return a.k > b.k})

*	michd is now known as MichD
<fullstack>	falafel, thanks again
<falafel>	:)
<falafel>	it assumes if fx is a number, fy must be a number too
<falafel>	but you'd have arrays with things of the same type anyway
<falafel>	it may work without that line
*	norm is now known as Guest41615
<cockatrice>	I have also discovered that for some reason on mobile, even when I put an alert at the top of d20pal.js, it will not display
<falafel>	fullstack, yeah, it works, that line isn't necessary
<falafel>	fullstack, http://jsfiddle.net/qwp5rpu3/1/
<cockatrice>	Is this indicative of a parsing error? Is there any way to see what's going on?
<cockatrice>	falafel: that dot function was very clever, I've never seen that before.

<_rgn>	i mean that talk
<_rgn>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3svKOdZijA

<PiL>	hello all, i am curious about when closures are needed. i understand that it is necessary to save state however, i see code that maintains a binary tree(http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2009/06/09/computer-science-in-javascript-binary-search-tree-part-1/), yet there is no closure
<Sharaal>	PiL: a closure is never really needed. but it can be simpler having a function with access to the outer scope as make an object
<josette>	Hi gus, i'm having toruble with my regex and that's probably a silly mistake but i just can't find it. I want my regexp to match all the {{.*}} groups but i don't have the result i want. Here is a pastebin to show you guys : http://pastebin.com/nQnWsstn
<josette>	but this only find one match that begin with the first occurence and end with last one
<GreenJello>	* is greedy, so it'll match as many times as it possibly can
<GreenJello>	which includes the }s, if there's a pair of them later on
<GreenJello>	use [^}]* instead of the . to exclude those
<Sharaal>	or {{.*?}}
<GreenJello>	\{\{[^}]*\}\}
<GreenJello>	yeah, or the question mark to make it lazy, but I remember there are some weird caveats with that
<josette>	ok im trying it
<mllbp>	hey all
<josette>	the {{.*?}} works really just i wanted to ! thanks a lot, i didnt know that th eregexp where looking fot the largest match
<josette>	thanks again guy

<Sharaal>	cockatrice: imo default parameter are es6, so perhaps not supported
<cockatrice>	Sharaal: I had no idea and foolishly assumed that was a normal language feature. Thanks for clearing that up! I can't believe such a trivial thing was causing so much trouble.
<Sharaal>	cockatrice: its a new feature :) but you can do something like this: function (a) { a = a || 'blah'; }
<Sharaal>	thats the idiom for es5
<Sharaal>	or use a es6 to es5 compiler
<cockatrice>	Yeah, I knew I could do that, I'm not actually really sure why I used that syntax in the constructor to be honest.

<Sharaal>	>> var X = [ {}, {}, {} ];  X.forEach( function(x,i) { X[i] = i*i; } );  console.log( X[1] );
<ecmabot>	Sharaal: undefined; Console: 1
<Sharaal>	this works
<pi->	Sharaal: yes, but that's not the point I'm going for.
<pi->	I'm trying to understand behaviour of that first parameter. I read that Numbers get passed by value but Objects get passed by reference.
<Sharaal>	technically its always pass by value
<Sharaal>	but the value of an object variable is only the reference to the object
<Sharaal>	so the reference get copied but point to the same object, so you can change that object
<pi->	So what is going on in my last example? Each time that function executes, surely the parameter x is going to reference the corresponding (empty) object in X.
<pi->	So when I change x, how come it isn't propagating back to e.g. X[1]?
<Sharaal>	you don't change the object, you change the locale variable x
<Sharaal>	>> var X = [ {}, {}, {} ];  X.forEach( function(x,i) { x.a = {foo:i*i}; } );  console.log( X[1] );
<ecmabot>	Sharaal: undefined; Console: {a: {foo: 1}}
<Sharaal>	this works cause this changes the object, not override the local variable
<Sharaal>	if you want to understand, I think you must have a look at the theoretic/technical thing behind this behavior. google something like "stack heap in C"
<pi->	Nice example. So it changes an existing object (referenced through x), rather than creating a new object and having x now reference this new object.
<pi->	yer I've done my penance with C++ :)
<Sharaal>	its just the locale variable x. function (x,i) said x have as value the pointer to the every object of the array. if you manipulate this object, the object gets another state independ inside or outside the function, cause all references points to the exactly same object
<Sharaal>	but if you change x, you change only the value of the variable, so you override the reference of the object with a new value or a new object, but this is independ of the objects in the array
<Sharaal>	with paper and a little sketch it would be much more easier to explain as with words :D

<javascript688>	Hi everyone ; I add javascript files' name to an array named "files" in a script. Then, I foreach this array "files" and I add "files[i]" (so a name) to a string that contains "<head><script src ='"+files[i]+"'></script></head>" . My problem is : the DOM elements are WELL created , and thus, my browser displays very well the imports with the right files' names. BUT my scripts don't seem to really be imported. Why ?

<CasW>	Hey guys, I'm having a little problem with inheritance; I have this construction: Outline inherits Room inherits Graphic, and I want the constructor of Room to be called when I create a new Outline object, but when I do something like function Outline() { Room.call(this); }, I get "Outline is not a constructor" (while I know that Room is a proper constructor, new Room works as expected)
<hipsterslapfight>	any reason why `array.sort(function () {return 0})` would return an array with elements in a different order?
<javascript688>	Eppiox: yes :-(
<CasW>	hipsterslapfight: Well, array.sort isn't necessarily stable according to the specs, so you can't be sure that two elements will stay in the same order if they have the same value
<Eppiox>	if you inspect element on the page, is the loop version and the manual version the same?  You could try append it to the bottom of the body tag too

<joker89>	Hi, i am adding an addeventlistener on the onmousevent for the submit input and after that it prevents the click event. Why?
<Deekay>	<Deekay> Does some of you know a Framework that supports JavaScript and is able to download multiple files ( a total of 1-2 Gb) from a server without the need to manually click it??? It should be have a defined path on the hard drive to download to, or you should be able to set one. JavaScript needs to be able to read those files. Has anyone an idea?
<javascript077>	hey guys what is WSS used for ?
<javascript077>	trying to look at codes with that implementation like this one: http://pastebin.com/WJfWhgy1
<nbt>	joker89: it's impossible to say without seeing the code
<joker89>	Itss easy its like: inputelemenr.addeventlistener("onmousedown", function(e){}); and this prevents onclick events over that inputelement
<javascript077>	Can anyone briefly explain what this does? http://pastebin.com/zNvu70VW
<javascript077>	I'd really like to know what WS/WSS is and what's it used for

<Boogymanx>	Hey guys, anyone got any D3.js experience? I have a force layout with a root node, that one has three children and each child has several nodes as well
*	Bauer2 is now known as Bauer
<Boogymanx>	For one of the nodes, I want to hide the children
<Boogymanx>	But for some reason instead of hiding they just detach from the node
<outofscope>	javascript077: It looks like a portnumber used by this "Client" constructor.

<javascript077>	outofscope: I see,
<luaboy>	how to pass data from page1 tp page2 ?
<okdamn>	how do i get the first item in this object [oi:{hey:3}, ai:{hey:4}] ?
<jaawerth>	okdamn: that isn't a valid object
<okdamn>	jaawerth:  mmmm you're right
<okdamn>	jaawerth:  how to get first item in {o: {}, e: {}} ?
<jaawerth>	okdamn: well, objects don't have a strict order, so there isn't really a "first" item. you have no guarantee of any sort of order from the object
<okdamn>	>> var x = {o:4, e:5}; return x[0];
<ecmabot>	okdamn: SyntaxError: return not in function
<jaawerth>	okdamn: you could, say, sort the keys alphabetically or something
<okdamn>	ah mmmm no i just need one random
<serses>	guys how you would implement an undo/redo command?
<okdamn>	no sorry forget don't mind
<okdamn>	i will make it an array
<Nazral>	I read somewhere that it's better to include the .js files right before the </body> instead of in the header, is that true ?
<serses>	in js can you convert a string to a function without using eval?
<RLa>	okdamn, Object.keys gives you array, take a random from there
<okdamn>	RLa:  mmm ok but i am going to change things atm i'll tell you in a moment thanks a lot
<okdamn>	so now i have [{idUser: 4, idRoom: 6},{idUser: 5, idRoom: 7}] RLa
<jaawerth>	yeah, Object.keys would be the way
<okdamn>	how can i get the item with idUser === 7 ?
<okdamn>	sorry === 5
<jaawerth>	but it sounds like an array might be better for your usecase anyway
<okdamn>	jaawerth:  yes check, i changed that ;)
<okdamn>	but i just want to retrieve array objects by objects keys value
<okdamn>	mmmm wondering if will be too heavy when object gets large
<okdamn>	what's the best way to store many user id and retrieve them in array?
<jaawerth>	well, with es6 (or es6-shim, which is a great thing to use all the time if you aren't using babel or whatever), you can do array.find(function(item) { return item.idUser === 7; })
<TyrfingMjolnir>	Can anyone please show me 3 or more nested anon functions with traversal of variables and use of return?
<jaawerth>	okdamn: without it, you'll have to use indexOf and then use the index
<okdamn>	jaawerth:  i am on node do you tihnk it's possible?
<okdamn>	mmm i need some better structure so, object or array need to try ufff, thanks
<jaawerth>	okdamn: well, if you use es6-shim with node, sure
<okdamn>	i want to be able to easily retrieve and delete array items by key
<javascript077>	outofscope: I dont have that much knowledge in scripting but does web-socket have anything to do with socket.io?
<okdamn>	i don't want to search over the array or object i need something better , don't mind thanks :D
<jaawerth>	uh, you have to search either way, unless you actually make an object whose keys are the id
<lalaland1125>	javascript077, Socket.io is like a polyfill for web-sockets. It allows you to use web socket features even when they are not natively supported by your browser.
<jaawerth>	if you're worried about efficiency, you could keep the array sorted and use binary search
<okdamn>	jaawerth:  exactly
<jaawerth>	(if you're using lodash, they have a built in option for binary search when an array is sorted)
<okdamn>	if the object key is the id i can delete by object.id but i can't get object[0].data
<jaawerth>	correct
<okdamn>	jaawerth:  nono would like to avoid at all searching and filtering :(
<lalaland1125>	Using an object is a better choice than a sorted array in most cases.
<jaawerth>	you can't have it both ways I'm afraid, not trivially anyway
<_rgn>	you want to avoid searching and filtering, why?
<jaawerth>	but yeah, if you want instant access by a key, you'd want to use an object. but then you can't get the "first" item
<paskaak>	hey guys, is there a more elegant way to use onMouseOver or onMouseOut events on images than just making the image a link?
<okdamn>	exactly that's my problem roght now :D
<javascript077>	lalaland1125: ah I see
<okdamn>	_rgn:  cause array or object could become huge
<okdamn>	v huge
<_rgn>	how many items do you have?
<lalaland1125>	okdamn, Use IndexedDB then.
<okdamn>	i would like direct access to keys and values
<okdamn>	lalaland1125:  that is not a bad idea…. never used so far
<okdamn>	node indexed db?
<_rgn>	are you trying to solve a problem you don't have?
<jaawerth>	it's node. you can use an *actual* database :P
<jaawerth>	or redis
<okdamn>	nah :P db connection
<jaawerth>	but it sounds like you're trying to overoptimize
<okdamn>	avoid :D
<lalaland1125>	okdamn, Oops, I thought you were talking about a browser application. If you are in node, use a normal database. (jaawerth's suggestion of redis is good)
<jaawerth>	redis is in-memory
<okdamn>	mmmm redis but write, read etc !?!
<okdamn>	direct array or object is better i think ….. !?!?
<jaawerth>	lol, pretty much every method will work, it depends on specific needs
<jaawerth>	just start with something easy to implement and optimize it later
<okdamn>	eheheh im doing it
<okdamn>	so direct access to object keys does not mean access to first item mmmm
<_rgn>	http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~adnan/pike.html
<okdamn>	my mind is burning
<jaawerth>	okdamn: what version of node are you using?
<okdamn>	jaawerth:  latest
<jaawerth>	in that case (0.12+), you could use a Map
<okdamn>	0.12.2
<okdamn>	jaawerth:  map like? :P
<TyrfingMjolnir>	Something like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29365661/how-to-return-value-from-nested-anonymous-function-javascript

<okdamn>	TyrfingMjolnir:  is it to me?
<michaelis>	Hi. If you use a constructor function, do you then write all your event listeners and functions related to the internal work of the object in your constructor function? What's the most reasonable way to do it?
<jaawerth>	b> var m = new Map().set(1, 'foo').set(2, 'bar').set(3, 'baz'); console.log("Val of '2':",m.get(2)); console.log("First:", m.entries().next().value);
<babelbot>	jaawerth: Val of '2': bar First: [ 1, 'foo' ] undefined
<TyrfingMjolnir>	okdamn: Nope, I'm elaborating on my own question above.
<jaawerth>	!Map @okdamn
<jaawerth>	!mdn Map @okdamn
<ecmabot>	okdamn: Map - JavaScript | MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map>
<okdamn>	TyrfingMjolnir:  sorry ;P
<okdamn>	jaawerth:  going to try it looks fkncool
<Nazral>	Do i need to do something special to my apache to be able to use AJAX and XMLHttpRequest ?
<Nazral>	because so far it doesn't work at all
<okdamn>	jaawerth:  and to return first item in map?
<jaawerth>	okdamn: the .values(), .keys(), and .entries() methods will give you an iterator that returns each respective thing (the key, the value, or the key/value pairs) in insertion order
<okdamn>	woa cool v v cool
<okdamn>	thanks
<jaawerth>	okdamn: I already showed a snippet of that. m.values().next().value
<okdamn>	yeah saw now thx :)
<jaawerth>	a little ugly looking but only because I didn't do var iterator = m.values()
<jaawerth>	and then work with the iterator
<okdamn>	awesome  going to try :D
<jaawerth>	Maps also have .forEach builtin
<jaawerth>	so you don't have to do Object.keys(obj).forEach(function(key) { // do stuff with obj[key] })
<jaawerth>	the other really cool thing about Maps is you can use *any* value as a key
<jaawerth>	primitives, objects, anything
<jaawerth>	(just watch out, because it actually has to be the same object - like, obj1 = {a: 'hi'}, obj2 = {a: 'hi'} will not retrieve the same thing from the map
<paskaak>	a very beginner question but i'm having trouble to find it, if i use .style.display="none", how do i make it display again later?
<zap0>	paskaak, block
<RLa>	paskaak, use a class that sets it, then removing the class restores the original value
<jaawerth>	TyrfingMjolnir: you (usually) can't just unwrap a callback for an async process like that
<jaawerth>	TyrfingMjolnir: however, using promises will greatly simplify the flow there and help you avoid callback hell, since promises will never multi-wrap
<jaawerth>	TyrfingMjolnir: by which I mean, a promise returned from within a promise will not require you to call .then twice
<TyrfingMjolnir>	I do not really care about promises and the easy way out
<TyrfingMjolnir>	I would like to solve the puzle in my head
<TyrfingMjolnir>	And be able to do the callback hell
<jaawerth>	well, promises don't actually avoid the issue, just ensure you aren't stuck in callback hell
<TyrfingMjolnir>	Is there an example that has only variables, return and console.log?
<TyrfingMjolnir>	With nothing extra to decipher?
<okdamn>	jaawerth:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/909003/javascript-getting-the-first-index-of-an-object check the second answer looks cool nope?
<jaawerth>	not for something async, unless you're using ES6 or ES7
<okdamn>	ah ok
<jaawerth>	no, that was for TyrfingMjolnir
<jaawerth>	okdamn: for your question, for..in is super broken, first of all, and could end up giving you something on the prototype chain
<jaawerth>	second of all, taht still guarantees no order at all
<okdamn>	ah damn ok
<jaawerth>	(plus it'd return a key, not the value)
<jaawerth>	you'd be better off doing obj[Object.keys(obj)[0]] to get a "first" object, but that still guarantees no order
<outofscope>	jaawerth: ...and if you're using ES6 or ES7?
<jaawerth>	outofscope: for the callback thing?
<outofscope>	jaawerth: Yeah.
<okdamn>	jaawerth:  if i do Object.keys(object) i get an array of keys maybe then [0] will be the first object key nope?
<jaawerth>	outofscope: in ES7 you can use async...await to avoid the use of callbacks, in ES6 you can use generators (helped along by co if you want to save on code) to unwrap callbacks and/or promises to sort of simulate async/await
*	juampy_food is now known as juampy
<jaawerth>	okdamn: the array of keys will not have a guaranteable predictable order
<okdamn>	damn as i thought ok
<jaawerth>	if you don't care about order then sure, but then the word "first" is pretty meaningless
<okdamn>	i will try map
<okdamn>	jaawerth:  yeah i agree damn ;)
<jaawerth>	Map at least will always have an "order" that is equal to the order of insertion
<jaawerth>	if you want to impose an actual order, you're back to sorting an array
<jaawerth>	but you can search a sorted array very quickly using binary search

<michaelis>	Hi. Can you call a function in a constructor which is defined in the same constructor?
*	jkoudys_ is now known as jkoudys
<willv2>	michaelis: Yes. Sounds smelly though
<willv2>	Usually you wont want functions to be declared inside other functions. Unless that's the only thing the outer function is doing
<michaelis>	willv2, Where should I put the functions? I'm creating a drawing surface and have added a couple of event listeners to this surface. Outside it all?
<willv2>	michaelis: Well, can you paste your constructor? It depends on the pattern you're using
<rajrajraj>	is there any javascript code that can run in background of android built in browser specially when phone is locked
<cjohnson>	Knowing that it defeats the security, can I make a CORS request from http to https, assuming the header is correct? Or will I get mixed content warnings
<cjohnson>	rajrajraj: not likely. what do you mean by "background"? why does it have to run in the browser?
<cjohnson>	why not just create an actual app. you can even use node.js I'm sure
<_rgn>	xqo: i'd probably come up with a function that gets full name from first and last name in an object; like fullName(userObj); // => "Jane Janeson"
<rajrajraj>	cjohnson:  background  =  when i minimize the browser
<rajrajraj>	cjohnson  sorry it has to be code on browser
<cjohnson>	ok, and the other question I asked?
<cjohnson>	no I asked why
<cjohnson>	not what
<michaelis>	willv2, http://pastebin.com/0NaC8hZg
<rajrajraj>	cjohnson:  because my app runs in browser
<NikoZz>	I found pdfkit which seems to support SVGs but I cannot figure out how to set headers and footers
<willv2>	michaelis: If you define the function in the .prototype, then you should be able to access it in the constructor. If you define it in the constructor just make sure it's defined before you call it.
<willv2>	Are you talking about draw_circle?
<michaelis>	willv2, Yes I am.
<jmartinez>	I am having troubles with the responseError interceptor in AngularJS http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30033855/intercept-unathorized-api-calls-with-angular
<michaelis>	willv2, How do I make sure it's defined in the prototype before you call it? Can I control this?
<willv2>	You probably want "_Boo.prototype.draw_circle = function () {/* ... */}" (in the same place it is defined now) Then you will be able to use "this.draw_circle" in the constructor.
<willv2>	michaelis: If the prototype definition comes just after the constructor definition. Then when the constructor definition is available to call, so will the prototype.
<rajrajraj>	cjohnson:  any solution ?
<michaelis>	willv2, I see the prototype as an external API that people can use once they create the object with new. Maybe I have misunderstood it all. I wanted all these functions to be "hid" inside the object.
<willv2>	michaelis: "new _Boo()" creates a new object with _Boo.prototype in it's prototype chain. Then calls the _Boo function with the 'this' value set to that new object.
<willv2>	michaelis: Private functions aren't usually needed and you can get away with defining them in the same way as public ones (but with an underscore prefix or something). If you do need the function to be private you need to use a closure.
<bradleymeck>	avoid private (closured) functions
<bradleymeck>	if you can
<willv2>	^
<michaelis>	willv2, Ok, I understand. Maybe I should not bother with private functions and just make the thing work.
<bradleymeck>	even in other languages with "private" reflection makes all your puny static security go away, bwahaha, even your static typing won't save you now bwahaha (maniacal laughter continues to grow))

<michaelis>	willv2, One more question. The chosen_tool variable is defined for the _Boo object but I cannot address it in the handler function in the addEventListener function. Why?
<willv2>	michaelis: Because 'this' inside that function is the surface, not the _Boo
<michaelis>	willv2, I understand. Can I address the object in the function?
<FutureTense>	I'm looking for a js function to determine if a browser is a mobile device.  We found some codoe from detectmobilebrowsers.com but it is not reporting an iPad as being mobile.  This code was a few years old, so I thought you guys might be able to give a more definiative answer
<willv2>	One trick is to define "var that = this;" outside of the event listener, and then use 'that' inside the event listener. Or set the scope of the function a different way (there are a few options).
<Kartagis>	http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/k6196jc3/ all buttons get the same value. how come?
<willv2>	michaelis: You can use "this.surface.addEventListener("...", function (event) {...}.bind(this));" if you like. That will ensure whenever that event listener is called, the 'this' value will be whatever you bound it to.
<michaelis>	willv2, Thank you. I will do it the one of the ways you have proposed. Since I'm a beginner I will probably make all the beginners mistakes and will have to rewrite everything in the future. :)

<MikeECI>	Does anyone know of a function to determine if the browser is on a mobile device?
<ThePendulum>	is 'something++' frowned upon?
<ThePendulum>	JSLint is yelling at me; "Expected '+= 1' and instead saw '++'."
<Sharaal>	MikeECI: I only know solutions depends on the user agents. But whats your use case why you needing this?
<bradleymeck>	MikeECI: if this is for visuals, check media-queries, not browser
<Shayanjm>	yoshuawuyts: I figured out how to get the behavior i want, but I can't reason about why the solution works over the other things I tried

<manik>	Hello
<foofin>	Hello!
<jaawerth>	what do people think, if I want to trigger an action that ends up in data flowing through a persistent stream, better to use the stream as the event emitter, or use a separate event emitter and have the stream listen to it?
<jaawerth>	should I err on the side of cleaner, or more self-contained?
<manik>	I dont understand
<bradleymeck>	fantnn: not a generic selector, you can find the path and nth-child all the way to it
<bradleymeck>	but it is more sane to just set the style on the element directly
<jaawerth>	Alright, so I have this app I'm working on that syncs data from an external API in order to build a directory structure that matches its permission hierarchy. It's basically a "gateway" integration thing in node but whether it's ndoe or the browser is irrelevant
<rajrajraj>	 is there any javascript code that can run in background of android built in browser specially when phone is locked
*	iiulian is now known as Guest46763
<jaawerth>	so I have the polling set on a trigger, but to simplify the results, the poll data gets piped through a duplex stream that's always present.
<jaawerth>	streams are, themselves, event-emitters, so I could have the stream listen on itself for a 'trigger' event, but that feels kinda dirty
<jaawerth>	on the other hand, using a separate EventEmitter seems superfluous
<jaawerth>	guess I'll start with a separate emitter for now

<fantnn>	@bradleymeck yeah i don’t have any control over the html ;)
<bradleymeck>	fantnn: elem.style.fontSize = "12em"; etc.?
<bradleymeck>	you don't need html, just dom access
<zack_s_>	can I refer in a object literal a property to another property?
<bradleymeck>	zack_s_: rephrase that. {x:1,y:/*what do you want here*/}
<zack_s_>	{ foo : 'text', y :this.foo}
<zack_s_>	bradleymeck: is this valid?
<bradleymeck>	no
<bradleymeck>	y: function () {return this.foo;} works though
<pi->	if( a <= a_winner||a ) { a_winner = a; ... } // is this good form?  The first time round a_winner will be undefined, so it should get set to the first a.
<cjohnson>	rajrajraj: nope. if the browser is sleeping, the browser is sleeping
<pi->	Is there any quick way to check precedence?  ##c++ channel bot has a `--precedence` flag... Is there anything equivalent here?
<cjohnson>	you can't break out of it. if you want to do things outside the scope of the browser, you need to write your app outside the scope of the browser. pretty obvious really
<leporello>	any lodash underscore users?
<rajrajraj>	cjohnson:  i can do that in iphone, why not in android
<leporello>	I have an array of objects. What's the elegant way of getting value of one keys where another key equals to something?

<rajrajraj>	what
<greves>	like function setAtPath(path, value) where path is an array of successive keys
<hackal>	Hello I have function which accepts 3 arguments my_function(day, time, callback) {...} but time is not really required so sometimes it may happen that someone will call my_function(day, callback) {...} but now callback is mapped to time argument. Is there a way other than moving time as last argument or forcing users use my_function(day, '', callback); ?
<rajrajraj>	oh
<greves>	So setAtPath(['one', 'two', 'foo'], 'bar)
<greves>	And that will be able to get myObj.one.two.foo equal to 'bar'
<Sharaal>	hackal: if (typeof time == 'function') { callback = time; time = undefined; }
<Sharaal>	hackal: as first line in the function
<greves>	cjohnson I started with some hard coded options but I've got 4 different ones now so id like to generalize it and refactor
<hackal>	Sharaal: thank you, also do you think this is a good practice or it is better to have time last?
<Sharaal>	hackal: I would always assume the callback function is the last parameter. imo its a common idiom to handle optional parameter in this way. I don't like it I would use an object as parameter
<Sharaal>	hackal: my_function({ day: '', time: '' }, callback); or without time my_function({ day: '' }, callback); or if the day is the common usage my_function('', callback);
<Sharaal>	hackal: and the definition function my_function(options, callback) { if (typeof options != 'object') { options = { date: options }; } } }
<Sharaal>	hackal: but I'm pretty sure there exists much more preferred solutions :)

<jwpapi>	Can someone help me with my code
<jwpapi>	http://pastebin.com/bjENFL5s
<jwpapi>	It says itemsPerPage is undefined
<Flonk>	jwpapi: I assume you're doing `new PaginationHelper()`?
<Sharaal>	jwpapi: ofc, you need this.itemsPerPage = itemsPerPage in the constructor function and use this.itemsPerPage in the prototype function
<Flonk>	jwpapi: you need to set this.itemsPerPage
<Flonk>	Well, what Sharaal said
<greves>	cjohnson: https://bpaste.net/show/2995a61a1c17
<GoldMine>	Ah yes good old this
<Sharaal>	jwpapi: local variable like parameters are only inside the function available
<Sharaal>	yeah I would say never use this, but I think most devs like to be masochist ^^
<jwpapi>	ok thanks very much i was googling for a time but have not learned that and didnt find it . So thanks very much
<winsoff>	yansanmo, thanks for all the help.  You still rock.
<cjohnson>	greves: the way to do it would probably be recursive call
<Sharaal>	jwpapi: just get rid off this and prototype things, makes life easier
<jwpapi>	so everytime im having a function with arguments i have to store them with this.argument so i can use them in properties?
<greves>	cjohnson so this won't work? https://bpaste.net/show/66aa34c9cf95

*	kimiamania is now known as Guest80171
<jwpapi>	Im currently on a codewars challenge. From there the code is coming
<yansanmo>	what did I do again?
<Sharaal>	jwpapi: http://pastebin.com/9McHKtjC
<greves>	oh wait of course that won't work. stupid :P
<jwpapi>	ahh ok nice. If i format it like that i dont have to do the this.argument stuff
<greves>	that should be cursor = cursor[node] not cursor = tree[node]
<Sharaal>	jwpapi: yes, and you don't need prototype stuff too. so much easier to write and understand
<cjohnson>	greves: http://jsfiddle.net/ehmssdsh/
<cjohnson>	but actually you're not far off. your approach is prob better actually
<cjohnson>	you just need to do cursor = cursor[node]; I think
<jwpapi>	yes!
<cjohnson>	the only thing is I would add the hasOwnProperty check from my code in case your path doesn't exist
<jwpapi>	thank you sharaal. I was always reviewing the solutions of others at codewars, and now i get their formatting :)
<cjohnson>	also don't use for...in to loop over arrays. Use path.forEach
*	Guest80171 is now known as kimiamania
<greves>	cjohnson doesn't work this way, i'm trying it...
<jwpapi>	http://pastebin.com/xgf3J9E0
<cjohnson>	did you read what I just wrote?
<jwpapi>	and is it correct to put the different properties like this
<greves>	cjohnson yes, i tried with cursor[node] and in a .forEach instead of the loop
<cjohnson>	cool. add some console.logs and debug it
<Sharaal>	jwpapi: if you fix the syntax errors like the missing , between the two properties yes. and formatting it correct
<cjohnson>	I think you just need to stop before the last index
<greves>	cjohnson do you think doing it recursively like you wrote would be better?
<greves>	or would the way i have it be faster?
<jwpapi>	ahh ok
<jwpapi>	so a comma between two propertiers
<Sharaal>	yes
<athan>	If I wanted to make a webapp where buttons had their default behavior removed (did ajax calls instead, for instance), _but_ say I wanted to let people right-click and open a link in a new window. How could I achieve both of these in the same button?
<cjohnson>	greves: http://jsfiddle.net/5nkw3dLz/1/
<athan>	where opening a link in a new window still has the default behavior of the link
<cjohnson>	greves: performance is irrelevant for the most part. so don't worry about faster
<Sharaal>	athan: try to use <a> tag for button and give them a href
<greves>	ok
<jwpapi>	thanks Sharaal
<cjohnson>	but I do prefer iteration to recursion just for simplicity sake
<greves>	ah i see what i did wrong, ya i need to stop at the last one
<athan>	Sharaal: Alright I'll give it a try! Thank you!
<greves>	thanks
<cjohnson>	oh I have a mistake. remove that last cursor = value; line
<cjohnson>	it's redundant
<greves>	yeah
<greves>	i got that :P
<cjohnson>	actually you might just want to use mine haha. I just tried that one with an erroneous path and it didn't work
<cjohnson>	needs some better error checking
<cjohnson>	an else on line 10 that breaks out of the forEach somehow
<Sharaal>	athan: crap, that really works, but that means I must handle this scenario on my startpage too ^^
<cjohnson>	greves: like this: http://jsfiddle.net/5nkw3dLz/4/
<greves>	hmmm.
<cjohnson>	ok that's not too bad.
<athan>	Ha! Sharaal - hopefully things will get easier :)
<greves>	what's the point of `stop` instead of just return?
<Sharaal>	athan: this things are not really easy. 2 months work so far for my startpage, so much things which must be handled :(
<cjohnson>	greves: return doesn't stop forEach from continug to iterate the rest of hte items
<jwpapi>	http://pastebin.com/jUWYiuPu Sharaal  this is my final solution for the level. It works, but is the formatting correct now?
<athan>	Sharaal: Can I see it so far? :)
<Sharaal>	athan: I send you link per pm
<athan>	aie aie!
<greves>	cjohnson oh, so you need to return from them all like that. what about just using a label and `break` ?
<cjohnson>	you could switch it to use a standard for (not for...in!) and use break; instead of the stop business
<cjohnson>	I'm honestly not sure about labels I never use them
<cjohnson>	this is the one singular case I like $.each over Array#forEach
<cjohnson>	no short circuiting on the native
<greves>	heh
*	Xiti is now known as Pixi
*	Pixi is now known as Pixi`
*	Pixi` is now known as Xiti
<cjohnson>	oh ok. we could use Array.some for this
<greves>	really?
<cjohnson>	Array.some will stop as soon as any callback returns true
<cjohnson>	http://jsfiddle.net/5nkw3dLz/5/
<cjohnson>	best of both worlds
<greves>	wow first time i've seen Array.some in action , good going :P
<cjohnson>	\o/
<greves>	cjohnson would you advise putting another .hasOwnProperty in the first if () ?
<greves>	probably safer since i don't want to set parameters that dont' already exist
<greves>	cjohnson and the first if block should also return true, right?
<pi->	A>0 && B>0 -- how does this get evaluated?  && has the lower precedence.  So does that mean the expression is split by the first '>'?   'A'  '>'  '0&&B>0' ?
<cjohnson>	good point on the check. Instead of 2 checks I would just move the check farther up and return early if it fails
<cjohnson>	and return false; could be return true; but since you're at the last element it's arbitrary
<pi->	I *think* that's upside down, i.e. It splits on the lowest operator, in this case &&.
<greves>	http://jsfiddle.net/97rdsuam/
<beaconwriter>	Is there a way to add my own functionality to an existing click event? (using tampermonkey)
*	msg is now known as John
<cjohnson>	the else is redundant but yeah pretty much
<cjohnson>	http://jsfiddle.net/5nkw3dLz/6/
<beaconwriter>	I don't want to unbind, just stick my own code before the original one fires
<cjohnson>	the only thing I just noticed is that if the last element of the path doesn't exist, it won't create it for you
<cjohnson>	not sure if that's your desire
<cjohnson>	also the tests weren't being reset so I added that
<greves>	cjohnson yeah i don't want it to, i just want it to edit existing elements
<cjohnson>	but otherwise I think we got it
<greves>	yeah this is great, thanks
<cjohnson>	no prob
<greves>	no recursion necessary ;)
<cjohnson>	always messing with my brain, recursion
<nbt>	pi-: yes, your example is equivalent to (A>0) && (B>0)
<nbt>	the higher precedence operators get evaluated first
<nbt>	starting with the highest
<greves>	yeah recursion is beautiful and beautifully mind-boggling at the same time ;P
<pi->	Recursion is very simple if you understand the concept of the call stack.
<cjohnson>	greves: if you change it to if (!(node in cursor)) { at the top you can even do arrays: http://jsfiddle.net/97rdsuam/1/
<cjohnson>	ok I have to stop this madness now

<greves>	so weird i am on another computer than my usual one and syntax highlighting is different colors than sublimetext... so confused! :P
<greves>	i can barely tell what's happening in my code without sublimetext highlighting :(

<greves>	bewl i suppose you code everything in light-gray on a white background?
<bewl>	Notepad.exe
<bewl>	:P
<greves>	yeah i use Notepad too, but i've got it linked to just open sublime instead :D
<bewl>	i am actually just kidding
<bewl>	i would never put myself through that
<greves>	of course
<greves>	anyone who says they does is either insane or a liar
<bewl>	i personally use VS
<greves>	nice, just refactored that mess of spaghetti code that was building up as i added more and more key options haha
<greves>	got it down to one line (well, minus the new function but that's off in another module already, so i'm not counting that now)
<tocka>	hi :)
<tocka>	i have an interval that sends some data every 0.1 seconds
<tocka>	should I be concerned that the browser is going to slow down because of this reason? or that it will start eating a lot of ram?
<tocka>	:o
<cjohnson>	"sends some data" meaning what
<greves>	cjohnson ... want to do something else with this function? :P
<cjohnson>	an interval every 0.1 seconds alone shouldn't leak memory or consume a ton of resources. it's what you do in that callback that matters
<cjohnson>	greves: what?
<tocka>	cjohonson an object with 5 elements in it
<cjohnson>	that doesn't answer my question
<greves>	cjohnson i need the exact same thing but for adding or removing elements from an array at the final node
<cjohnson>	"send some data" how
<tocka>	using postMessage between 2 domains
<cjohnson>	greves: well if you use the node in cursor change I added at the end, arrays are already supported
<cjohnson>	then I dunno, make a special value that denotes "add" instead of replace?
<cjohnson>	tocka: sounds fine. what you do with that data probably matters more
<greves>	what 'node in cursor' ?
<tocka>	cjohnson thanks.. I dont do a lot, its for positioning divs
<tocka>	:)
<greves>	dont think i saw anything about that
<cjohnson>	11:52 < cjohnson> greves: if you change it to if (!(node in cursor)) { at the top you can even do arrays: http://jsfiddle.net/97rdsuam/1/
<greves>	ooh just scrolled up to see that hah
<greves>	ok, great
<greves>	then i just need to set an add/remove flag for arrays
<paskaak>	if an earlier function assigns a var x = "something", can i use .getElementById("id"+x)?
<cjohnson>	yeah exactly
<cjohnson>	paskaak: assuming you want to look up <node id="idsomething"> yes
<paskaak>	yes
<paskaak>	oh
<cjohnson>	getElementById expects a string for the ID, it doesn't care how you construct that string
<cjohnson>	literal, concatenated, variable, they're all strings
<paskaak>	i'm having trouble debugging my js, what's they easiest way to print the returned value of a function?
<cjohnson>	same is true elsewhere: anything that expects a string can accept "foo" or b (where var b = "foo";) or "foo" + "bar" etc
<cjohnson>	console.log the value before you return it
<cjohnson>	or: use your built-in step debugger

<Agamemnus>	iunno
<Agamemnus>	probably
<Agamemnus>	theweirdn8 I'm liking the screenshots.
<gtristan>	well, seems that way from the articles I'm reading
<gtristan>	although the specifics of it is burried under the noise about HTML5 history APIs ;-)
<Madmallard>	I'm wondering if people could give me feedback on this screening survey - Looking for anything UX /etc related - reasons why you might not want to continue all the way through it. It is about 10 pages long with 1 question per page... you do not need to do the survey it brings you to afterward (primarily because that's not my HTML). One thing to note is that the cookies overlay at the bottom
<Madmallard>	will not show for real users. Bonus points if you have seen this page before haha : http://survey.saysoforgood.com/trop/survey/50bb8073a0c6101ab41a6dbf
<joshbuddy>	anyone have a big preferrence for generating API docs? I think I finally settled on groc (https://github.com/nevir/groc), but haven’t found any great answers. jsdoc just drove me nuts.
*	norm is now known as Guest35356
<theweirdn8>	 Agamemnus any suggestions?
<Agamemnus>	I only looked at the screenshots
<Agamemnus>	so i don't know
<vmitchell>	haha, OMG, I was JUST having a conversation about API doc generation
<bprompt>	vmitchell:     how do you know joshbuddy  isn't texting that from his phone in the same room your'e in?
<vmitchell>	mostly because I’m home alone in my pj’s

<bprompt>	vmitchell:   hehe, serendipitious then =)
<joshbuddy>	im under your couch vmitchell
<joshbuddy>	you mainly can’t hear me because im using a phone, so no clicky clack
<vmitchell>	… O_O… rapey… or just a serial killer
<vmitchell>	regardless… that’s not gonna help you generate API docs :-P
<bprompt>	or just a Cereal killler
<joshbuddy>	just really into forced co working spaces
<vmitchell>	OMG, derp
<joshbuddy>	yeah, but for realz, api doc generation, gosh, the choices all seem sort of terrible. docco is okay i guess, big commitment to markdown, no support for annotations.
<vmitchell>	so, seems like, python, like every other language that isn’t Java/.NET needs more work on autodocs
<vmitchell>	what else is new
<joshbuddy>	jsdoc is just … a behemoth which doesn’t seem to actually work well. at least, i’m encountering a lot of frustration with it, and not a lot of helpful output from it. i guess you’ve got doxygen. i don’t really want to use doxygen because i fear its too hard to get going for everyone else
<joshbuddy>	groc seems okay. committment to markdown :( lack of annotation support.
<vmitchell>	jsdoc is def my fav
<vmitchell>	the closer I can get to JavaDoc level generation, the happier I’ll be. Wish I could get all the way to Sandcastle but that’s more than I feel like writing into anything
<vmitchell>	… and markdown is… *shrugs* it is what it is. Yet another DSL.
<Fluxxorz>	Hi. What's the best way to work with promises in the following case?
<Fluxxorz>	I've got a function which is basically an ajax-wrapper
<Fluxxorz>	if (someCondition) url = appendUrl(url);   callAjax(url).success(function(d) { promise.resolve(d); });
<Fluxxorz>	But say 'appendUrl' is asynchronous
<Fluxxorz>	Assuming I'm using jquery deferred, then I would have to do ' if (someCondition) url = appendUrl(url);.then(function(url) { callAjax(url).success(function(d) { promise.resolve(d); });}'
<Synthead>	if a constructor declares this.foo, what would you semantically call that variable?  an attribute?
<Fluxxorz>	But then I'd have to write the exact same ajax call inthe else-condition
<Fluxxorz>	So the quesiton is: Do I have to create a new function for the ajax call                 ..i mean this part   callAjax(url).success(function(d) { promise.resolve(d); })
<theweirdn8>	ok

<cjohnson>	what do you mean by dictionary
<cjohnson>	and how do you want to reduce its size
<mellowhacker>	{}
<Fluxxorz>	if (someCondition) url = appendUrl(url);.then(function(url) { performAjaxCall(url)})       else   performAjaxCall(url)
<cjohnson>	that's an object mellowhacker
<cjohnson>	but how do you want to reduce it's size?
<mellowhacker>	well ideally LRU but I'd be fine with randomly removing items from it
<mellowhacker>	I'm only using it for caching purposes
<cjohnson>	I would use something more explicit than a simple object if that's the case
<cjohnson>	for each item in the cache, store its value as well as last use time
<cjohnson>	then when you need to clear items out, sort the properties into an array by last use time, and then delete the relevant key
<cjohnson>	otherwise, you can use delete obj.foo to remove foo key from obj
<cjohnson>	use Math.random to randomly select
<mellowhacker>	ahh of course that makes sense
<mellowhacker>	storing hte timestamp helped me figure out what I'm gonna do
<mellowhacker>	cheers

<MetalHead77>	Is there a reason why geolocation works on every browser except the mobile version of chrome on android?
<ule>	hi there! what's the best way to write something on a div using native javascript?
<NoiseEee>	i would respectfully say thats not the case MetalHead77
<jaawerth>	I believe there are also tricks involving using two arrays instead of an object
<ule>	I'm feeling that document.write it's not the best way to do it
<jaawerth>	but it's always risky to code that stuff yourself since you'd have to account for engine differences
<cjohnson>	seemed to work for me MetalHead77
<cjohnson>	ule: get teh div via getElementById/querySelector/etc and set its .innerHTML property
<MetalHead77>	cjohnson: Does this work for you
<MetalHead77>	http://www.w3schools.com/htmL/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_geolocation
<bprompt>	ule:    hmmm depends. what are you doing, what are you writing for?
<MetalHead77>	in chrome on android?
<ule>	cjohnson: thanks
<ule>	bprompt: I have a text comming from the database.. I'm using a js regex to convert any link to <a href= + link </a>
<jaawerth>	cjohnson: oh cool, that npm module is just using a linked list ;-)
<jaawerth>	you don't see those in js that often these days
<jaawerth>	it makes sense though
<jaawerth>	you could also use a heap structure
<NoiseEee>	works MetalHead77, I am prompted to allow or block the browser from letting it use geolocation services
<bprompt>	ule:    hmmm I'd think the database output would already be like so...but as cjohnson  said, write to .innerHTML property, and that'd be fine
<MetalHead77>	NoiseEee: Did you get your lattitude and longitude coordinates as well?
<marchelzo_>	Hi. How does jQuery decide whether an AJAX request was a success or an error? I am sending a POST request and getting some json with a 200 status code, but for some reason it's calling the error callback.
<NoiseEee>	MetalHead77: i did after agreeing, yes
<ule>	alright
<ule>	thanks bprompt
<ule>	thanks guys!
<MetalHead77>	NoiseEee: With chrome on android??
<Sorella>	ule: doing that is a *REALLY BAD IDEA*
<NoiseEee>	MetalHead77: yep
<ule>	Sorella: what?
<NoiseEee>	MetalHead77: you sure you're not testing <default browser> on android?
<ule>	Sorella: why?
<MetalHead77>	NoiseEee: It works in the default browser on android. That's the funny part
<ule>	var re = /((([A-Za-z]{3,9}:(?:\/\/)?)(?:[-;:&=\+\$,\w]+@)?[A-Za-z0-9.-]+|(?:www.|[-;:&=\+\$,\w]+@)[A-Za-z0-9.-]+)((?:\/[\+~%\/.\w-_]*)?\??(?:[-\+=&;%@.\w_]*)#?(?:[.\!\/\\w]*))?)/ig;
<MetalHead77>	You would expect the other way around
<ule>	this is my regex
<NoiseEee>	MetalHead77: are you prompted at least? perhaps you turned it off in your chrome settings or something.  works fine for me 5.0.1
<NoiseEee>	MetalHead77: and latest Chrome
<cjohnson>	I don't have chrome on android to test for you MetalHead77
<Sorella>	ule: for security reasons. You don't want to treat plain text as HTML.
<cjohnson>	that doesn't mean yo udon't want to set innerHTML
<cjohnson>	just sanitize it first
<cjohnson>	marchelzo_: check network tab
<cjohnson>	look at response, headers
<cjohnson>	look for browser errors
<cjohnson>	JSON parse errors
<cjohnson>	etc
<Sorella>	cjohnson: well, that means they can't use a plain regular expression replace in the string
<marchelzo_>	cjohnson: It was a JSON parse error >.< forgot to quote key names.
<MetalHead77>	NoiseEee: Well I am using android 4.2.2. I wasn't even prompted
<cjohnson>	Sorella: sanitize and then linkify
<cjohnson>	not hard
<bprompt>	ule:   hmmmm got a snippet of what the database is outputting?  maybe you don't need to regex it,     js has a .link() method
<Sorella>	cjohnson: would change the semantics of the things in the links though
<_rgn>	Sorella: by the way, do you think a shorter way to access Maybe.fromNullable in the data.maybe api would be useful?
<cjohnson>	not sure what you mean Sorella
<NoiseEee>	MetalHead77: what version of chrome?
<bprompt>	>>  "swiss cheese".link("www.google.com")  @ ule
<ecmabot>	ule: (string) '<a href="www.google.com">swiss cheese</a>'
<ule>	bprompt: amazing
<cjohnson>	looks like the intention is to replace a URL with an <a> tag linking to that URL, using that URL as text
<ule>	bprompt: actually I have a text and in the mittle some Links..
<ule>	*middle
<Sorella>	cjohnson: what should `http://foo.com/bar/qux'foo` be converted to? What about `http://www.foo.com/foo<bar>`?
<cjohnson>	who cares if they use invalid stuff in their URLs
<MetalHead77>	NoiseEee: 42.0.231.111. How abaout you?
<cjohnson>	it will be relatively safe to display and linked for valid URLs
<NoiseEee>	MetalHead77: same. for shits and giggles i'd try uninstalling and re-installing.
<Sorella>	cjohnson: those aren't invalid in URLs
<NoiseEee>	perhaps you once clicked 'always block' or something?
<bprompt>	ule:     what's the database outputting anyway?   paste maybe a few lines, maybe you do need to regex it, maybe you don't
<cjohnson>	!mdn querySelector
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: Document.querySelector() - Web API Interfaces | MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector>
<cjohnson>	my client certainly correctly ignores the > and < here ^
<cjohnson>	they should already be escaped if they're part of the URL
<cjohnson>	either way. safe enough, and works fine for any real URL
<jaawerth>	you'd also probably want to account for stuff like data URLs
<cjohnson>	phaps but it didn't seem like his regex was accounting for that in the first place. really all I'm saying is there's nothing wrong with specialcharsing the string and then auto-linkifying URLs. will it cover 100% of possible URLs? Maybe not. But it will cover the big ones
<MitchM>	I have an array with timeseries data I am piping into d3 for graping. There is a large number of series in the array. What's the best method to get only the series out of the array that have a changed value over time?

<ule>	bprompt: this is an example: http://cole.php-br.org/84/ver-raw
<matthavard>	Does anyone know of a chrome plugin that can make it visibily obvious when chrome is not in focus?  I'm on multiple monitors and I frequently mistake which window is in focus, which can cause some inconvenience if I try to use keybindings for chrome when the actual active window is, say, Emacs
<bprompt>	ule:    hmmm wondering why you didn't choose to use json for that =), simpler to loop through
<buu>	matthavard: Get a better window manager!
<buu>	focus follows mouse
<ule>	bprompt: I don't have access to the method that gets from the database.. unfornately
<ule>	anyways
<ule>	nice channel
<ule>	gonna stay here to learn more about js
<ule>	thanks guys
<cjohnson>	matthavard: the window sort of dims when you're not focused on it, that not enough?
<matthavard>	No
<hrusti>	I want to create api wrapper in nodejs. If api's method is private client first have to get token by posting id,secret etc. and api respond with access token. In api wrapper (client side) I have method which generates requests to send to api. Inside that method I check if api's method is private(if requests token) and if is I want to recursively call that method to first retrieve token and then proceed with method I wa
<hrusti>	nted to call. Problem is that sending request is non blocking and second request is sent before I get response with access token. Is there any solution to wait until access token is retrieved?

<fantnn>	if i have 2 objects that have a bunch of functions within them, and i want to ensure that some functions in 1 can only call some in the other and vice versa how can i do that?
<jaawerth>	oh, maybe I did. usually I at least get the same first letter right

<hrusti>	this is the request
<fantnn>	arguments.callee.caller does not seem to work
<zomg>	hrusti: that should work
<canvasnoob>	hello I have a question about drawing on a canvas, I was just beginning with learning it by making this little thing: http://codepen.io/arianr/pen/qdOxEz . The problem is that after resizing it doesn't redraw, even though it runs the exact same function as the first time
<pi->	methoid :)
<zomg>	hrusti: of course you'd need to add the callback to it. the nodejs api you're using most likely provides a callback parameter which you'd need to handle then
<jaawerth>	fantnn: IIRC arguments.callee is disabled in strict mode and also heavily discouraged (which is why it was disabled in strict mode)
<canvasnoob>	anyone know why the canvas stays white after resizing? The function itself seems to check out, I'm not sure if I'm missing something about redrawing on a canvas
<hrusti>	zomg: http://jsfiddle.net/qmsbv2cn/1/
<hrusti>	like this?
<fantnn>	ya, does anyone know how to gain any kind of similar functionality?
<hrusti>	zomg: but how do I handle it with recursive call
<jaawerth>	hahaha oh ecmabot you card
<jaawerth>	!recursion
<ecmabot>	jaawerth: See !recursion
<jaawerth>	!callee
<ecmabot>	jaawerth: See !recursion
<jaawerth>	hehe
<bprompt>	`callee
<zomg>	hrusti: that's exactly how it should work :)
<episage>	  hi guys, im looking for a good memoization framework for JS, what can you recommend?
<ljharb>	why do you need a framework for that
<hrusti>	zomg: but it doesnt
<hrusti>	:)
<episage>	ljharb: i dont want mess in my code
<ljharb>	so make a separate “memoize” function
<ljharb>	and you won’t have any mess
<zomg>	hrusti: then I'd imagine the code that's not visible here has some problem, the basic flow is correct in the fiddle at least
<canvasnoob>	episage, underscore and lo-dash have a memoize function
<canvasnoob>	that's what I use anyhow
<episage>	canvasnoob: lodash looks kool, diving in...
<canvasnoob>	_.memoize( function(){} ) and done
<canvasnoob>	:)
<episage>	oo yeah
<episage>	love it
<episage>	:*
<episage>	thanks
<jaawerth>	that's kinda like raising an army to go to the mall though
<jaawerth>	... that was my worst metaphor all day
<hrusti>	zomg: http://jsfiddle.net/qmsbv2cn/2/ maybe now you see what is my problem?
<canvasnoob>	yeah, memoize is fairly simple to make yourself
<jaawerth>	there are probably also individual npm modules for it if you wanted to use third party code
<canvasnoob>	but honestly though, in my experience when I add lo-dash to a project, I just start using it everywhere
<jaawerth>	don't get me wrong, I used to loooove lodash
<jaawerth>	but I've since come around to preferring smaller individual modules to "this is your entire toolkit" type stuff
<_rgn>	lodash.memoize
<_rgn>	^ npm install
<jaawerth>	(that said, I still get tempted by highland a lot)
<jaawerth>	ah there you go
<jaawerth>	hehe
<zomg>	hrusti: ah, yep. You need to make it not run the call on line 13 when it needs to get the token first. Then, just have it call the function again from the callback on line 8 after setting the token, but I get the feeling the this.token might not be the correct way to do that, since you declare the token variable with `var` earlier.
<jaawerth>	I forget lodash was split into individual modules
<jaawerth>	here's an interesting post about various techniques (with code samples) http://addyosmani.com/blog/faster-javascript-memoization/
<zomg>	Problem of installing a bigger module containing things wouldn't exist with a compiler that would just nuke unused parts of the code like closure compiler with advanced optimizations
<zomg>	too bad closure with advanced is kinda pain to use :P
<jaawerth>	granted I'd have to spend some thought on it to decide whether I agree
<jaawerth>	doesn't babel do dead code elimination now too?
<ljharb>	closure compiler with advanced is dangerous.
<ljharb>	jaawerth: how could it?
<bradleymeck>	ljharb: some dead code opts are safe
<ljharb>	jaawerth: dead code elimination isn’t really possible without 100% es6 modules
<bradleymeck>	in fire dead code removal*
<ljharb>	bradleymeck: the safe ones don’t usually gain you much tho :-)
<bradleymeck>	in file*
<ljharb>	but sure
<jaawerth>	ljharb: their docs page on the subject is now giving a 404. apparently it was deemed dead code and eliminated
<bradleymeck>	the bigger fish is modules like you said, but it is dangerous as... when is a module actually dead
<ljharb>	jaawerth: lol
<ljharb>	a module actually being dead is totally safe
<bradleymeck>	in the far flung future a module could be loaded w/ System.loader (or w/e it is now) that uses what was considered dead
<zomg>	ljharb: dangerous how?
<jaawerth>	ljharb: I'm still using ES6 modules I CAN'T HELP IT I'M COMMITTED NOW
<ljharb>	jaawerth: nah, it’s still too soon :-p
<ljharb>	zomg: it’s unreliable, it forces you to change the way you write your code (instant dealbreaker for any non-linter tool)
<jaawerth>	at least, in a couple of applications I  am
<hrusti>	zomg: idk what do you mean?
<zomg>	ljharb: yeah that's why I said it's kinda painful =)
<ljharb>	zomg: you can’t customize the style guide
<ljharb>	it’s a JS tool from google. of course it’s painful. it’s for java devs.
<jaawerth>	ljharb: on the bright side, it very strongly encourages you to do one-export-per-module
<zomg>	hrusti: ok let me modify the fiddle a bit to maybe give you a better idea
<ljharb>	jaawerth: only if you `export default` tho, right/
<hrusti>	zomg: great
<canvasnoob>	going to re-ask, I have a problem with resizing my canvas, it clears the canvas and it stays white after a resize: http://codepen.io/arianr/pen/qdOxEz
<canvasnoob>	does anyone know why this is happening?
<zomg>	hrusti: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/qmsbv2cn/3/
<jaawerth>	right. Because if you use a default export and don't do a single export, then if you need to use require on that module, you need to do require('foo').default to get at it
<canvasnoob>	if I remove the line that resizes the canvas, it doesn't seem to do this
<jaawerth>	which means it isn't transparent
<jaawerth>	on the other hand, this also means you aren't mutating your default export with the other ones like you do with CommonJS when using multiple exports
<jaawerth>	ljharb: but that's also why I'm kinda stuck with it now in a couple of apps. Because if I'm not consistent about it I'm going to run into weirdness
<jaawerth>	not that it's a big deal, obviously I wouldn't be using experimental stuff in these apps if I needed to play it safe with 'em
<hrusti>	zomg: ok I get the point

<Sorella>	Hmm, that doesn' t quite explain asynchronous semantics though
<Sorella>	jaawerth: what's confusing?
<doc|work>	rockfruit: hah
*	Renarii is now known as Renari
<jaawerth>	Sorella: just seeing "CPS" while I've been wading through CSP jargon
<jaawerth>	heh
<jecran_>	Sorella: alternative?
<Eppiox>	mm i remember reading about that in Uni.. and hoping I never saw it again
<Renari>	Is there another function like encodeURI that will encode '/' as %2F and other such characters? [&?=]
<jaawerth>	it's the bread and butter of JS
<Sorella>	jecran_: but basically, in Node, a lot of functions are non-blocking (or asynchronous), which means that when you do `a(); b()`, and `a` is asynchronous, Node will start the computation in `a` in a background thread, and merrily jump to evaluate `b` right away.
<jaawerth>	so.. get used to it ;-)
<jecran_>	doc|work: 7mins lol
*	Guest67313 is now known as Torkable
<Sorella>	jecran_: so, if you want to *sequence* those computations again, you'd need something else that isn't "the semicolon operator". So, you can either replace the semicolon there with promises, so you've got `a().then(b)`, or with CPS, so you've got `a(b)`.
<doc|work>	jecran_: 7 mins?
<jecran_>	the video :P
<doc|work>	jecran_: 27 for me...
<bprompt>	Renari:    maybe you're looking for encodeURIComponent()
<Sorella>	There are other alternatives, but they're not possible in JS today.
<Renari>	bprompt, thanks

<cool_boy>	could someone help me to find out syntax error from https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1de36767d67964ce6a16, I tried .js hint but I can't get the hint
<HotCoder>	how come #javascript redirects me here?
<olfox>	can i use window as a parameter name?
<olfox>	function (window) { ... }
<rockfruit>	HotCoder somnething to do with the 'officialness' of the channel I think.
<rockfruit>	olfox I'm sure you can, but why would you?
<olfox>	its the only part messing with the window
<olfox>	and i dont want to call it windowStore
<lalaland1125>	I think #name implies official ##name implies unofficial
<olfox>	or rather, its the only way i access window related stuff
<olfox>	i call the other store vars like routing and not routingSotre
<j201>	olfox: you can, and it will be a new variable, but it will be misleading for people reading your code (possibly including future you)
<olfox>	i guess
<cool_boy>	I could solve error, thanks
<rockfruit>	olfox I would avoid it, mostly because most folks will call you silly names when they see it.
<j201>	cool_boy: using consistent formatting or running it through a formatter would help avoid that
<olfox>	window is such a bad global name
<olfox>	i might call it browser instead
<olfox>	but meh
<rockfruit>	olfox document, window, console, these are 'great' global names!  imnsho
<olfox>	yeah i say fck it
<olfox>	lets use them and lets confused people handle it
<rockfruit>	anyway, I'm learning, that 'pretty' is somewhere like, tenth on my list of priorities.  It's made me be more me, that realisation.
<olfox>	i am too good for any more reserved words goddamnit
*	fsync_ is now known as fsync
<cool_boy>	j201: what formatter for example?
<cool_boy>	I think it is window is great global name
<cool_boy>	I think window is great global name*
*	robotmayo is now known as zz_robotmayo
<ljharb>	it’s not, but it doesn’t matter. it’s the browser’s global name.
<b4b>	is dairy really the cause of most of western illness?
<rcyr>	Cheap fast food probably.
<j201>	cool_boy: most editors will fix your indentation at least
<rockfruit>	physical atrophy
<j201>	depends on what you're using
<ljharb>	b4b: lol what?
<j201>	otherwise, i'd look at existing style guides and try to follow more consistent rules
<cool_boy>	j201: I am using eclipse, and I think indentation is okay, seems wrong?
<rockfruit>	pycharm has a wonderfully configurable autoformatter for js..... I showed someone here and they told me that eclipse does this too.
<rockfruit>	I insist on this, whenever I have the power to veto PRs.
<rcyr>	lol eclipse
<cool_boy>	:P
<cool_boy>	rcyr: is it bad?
<rcyr>	It sucks for _everything_... even for the language it was created for: Java
<rockfruit>	rcyr: yeah, the cause of most western illness.
<rockfruit>	intellij ftw
<rcyr>	Yup
<j201>	cool_boy: the first function there has really weird indentation, and everything else has an initial indent of 12 spaces, which is bizarre and doesn't match the indentation levels used elsewhere
<cool_boy>	rcyr: infact you are right , it does.. it doesn't even suggest already used variables , sometimes I make typos and see only after server restart :s
<j201>	cool_boy: also, the second last closing brace should be in the first column, since it matches the first opening brace, which would show where your syntax error is
<rockfruit>	I just remember that it feels like MS Word 95 on a 486.
<cool_boy>	agreed j201
<cool_boy>	what is best way to get index of 1 in [1, 2] , is there other method than splice?
*	XCVB is now known as _X_C_V_B_
<cool_boy>	sorry wrong question
<rcyr>	cool_boy: Yup, wrong question
<j201>	in vim, i just type =ap or =aa every now and then, which autoindents a paragraph and the entire file respectively
<rcyr>	I like emacs js2-mode
<rcyr>	It even supports ES6 now.
<rcyr>	Anyway.... vim and emacs power!
<andrew39>	can i offer to pay someone here to do something quick for me
<rcyr>	j201: I didn't know about =aa
<andrew39>	been struggling with this crap for a few hours
<rcyr>	j201: I used to do: gg=G
<j201>	rcyr: it's a custom text object of mine
<cool_boy>	what is best way to get index of  2 in array  [1, 2]  ( if you don't know 2 is present in array but you are sure there are only 2 elements and 1 must be present in array , 2 can be anything4 )
<b4b>	anyone use chrome linux here?
<rcyr>	j201: Ha! I see
<b4b>	can you let me know the framerate on http://lakelegends.com ?
<andrew39>	b4b, firefox here if it works for you
<rcyr>	cool_boy: .indexOf
<rcyr>	nvm...
<j201>	rcyr: it's one of the bindings i really miss without my vimrc: https://github.com/j201/vimrc/blob/master/_vimrc#L149-L151
<rcyr>	I don't understand the question
<rcyr>	j201: Nice :)
*	MrDigital is now known as mrdigital|mac
<cool_boy>	okay I try to explain again , there is an array with exactly 2 elements you know 1 of them and need to know index of other, eg in a =[1,n]  you know only a.length == 2 and 2 must be there, what is index of 'n'?
<cool_boy>	1 must be there **
<rcyr>	j201: I recently tried to use "unite" instead of ctrl-p, it's not bad
<j201>	rcyr: yeah, i'm curious about it, but i haven't quite had the time and interest to test it out
*	BoMa is now known as Jagoan
<j201>	there are lots of vim plugins i feel that way about
<rcyr>	cool_boy: (indexOfTheOneYouKnow + 1) % a.length ?
<rcyr>	cool_boy: I'm not sure, you're being really vague
<Dev0n>	hey, is it possible that your window load event gets setup after the document has loaded in which case the event never fires?
<falafel>	j201, that's very similar to my binding ,aa for selecting all, then =
<falafel>	 ,aa=
<rcyr>	j201: The reason why I switched to emacs after years of vim usage is because I think that overall, emacs plugins are higher quality... and it has a package manager
<rcyr>	I still deeply love vim though...
<falafel>	I want my vim-mod wherever I go
<falafel>	*vim-mode
<falafel>	the rest I dont care that much, vimscript is awful, and gvim could have nicer ui
<rcyr>	I don't mind the UI of gvim (I remove all of it) but yeah... vimscript is an ugly monster.
<falafel>	neovim looks like a good step forward
<tejasmanohar>	I know you can have href="sms: {{phone number}}" to open messages app on iOS with a phone # on the to line filled in
<tejasmanohar>	but can i fill in a default message
<falafel>	rcyr, well, some plugins could really benefit from integrating with the system better, ctrl+p, automcomplete, etc
<rcyr>	I can't agree more
<cool_boy>	rcyr: I try again, how do I get index of 3 in [1, 3] , but 3 is not known to me but 1 is known to me, basically I need to know index of unknown element
<Woet>	tejasmanohar: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme
<tejasmanohar>	https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/featuredarticles/iPhoneURLScheme_Reference/SMSLinks/SMSLinks.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007899-CH7-SW1
<rcyr>	cool_boy: Then what I gave you should work
<tejasmanohar>	It says "The sms scheme is used to launch the Messages app. The format for URLs of this type is “sms:<phone>”, where <phone> is an optional parameter that specifies the target phone number of the SMS message. This parameter can contain the digits 0 through 9 and the plus (+), hyphen (-), and period (.) characters. The URL string must not include any message text or other information."
<tejasmanohar>	so i guess i cant pass in a message?
<tejasmanohar>	anywhere?
<Woet>	tejasmanohar: did you try reading the link I gave you?
<tejasmanohar>	Woet: oh sms:+15105550101?body=hello%20there
<tejasmanohar>	Woet: but how come apple dev says no??
<falafel>	rcyr, so far, atom looks the most promising to me, out of all the new editors that have been coming out
<Woet>	tejasmanohar: they don't say no.
<rcyr>	falafel: Same, but it is "heavy"
<andrew39>	its a quickie! pm me if youre interested. if you dont like it walk away
<cool_boy>	rcyr: then if I am trying correct (a.indexof[1]+1) % a.length ? it gives me NaN
<rcyr>	indexOf is not indexof
<falafel>	rcyr, yeah, 400mb on average use, and startup time is not great, but the editor performance has really improved, selecting, having multiple tabs open, etc
<rcyr>	And [] is not the same as ()
<Woet>	tejasmanohar: also http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6480462/how-to-pre-populate-the-sms-body-text-via-an-html-link
<rcyr>	>> var x = [42, 1]; var index = (x.indexOf(1) + 1) % x.length;
<ecmabot>	rcyr: undefined
<rcyr>	Hmm
<rcyr>	>> var x = [42, 1]; var index = (x.indexOf(1) + 1) % x.length; index;
<ecmabot>	rcyr: (number) 0
<rcyr>	cool_boy ^
<cool_boy>	thanks worked
<andrew39>	$20?
<j201>	falafel: one thing i like about vim is that if i want to modify my editing workflow, the code for it might not be pretty, but vim can almost always accommodate how i want to do things
<j201>	for example, most people will only use a couple, but there are dozens of ex commands and key mappings to close the editor in various ways

<rcyr>	The classic one being ctrl+z and killall vim

<j201>	i haven't seen a recent editor that can easily accommodate so many approaches
<tejasmanohar>	Woet: body isnt filled :
<tejasmanohar>	:\
<tejasmanohar>	Apple says you cant on the docs so nvm
<Woet>	tejasmanohar: no, they don't
<Woet>	tejasmanohar: their docs don't say "you can't fill out the body"
<Woet>	tejasmanohar: what's the code you ended up using?
*	John is now known as John-zzz
<Cthulchu>	Hi fellas! Does anybody use Eclipse for JS? is it a good idea?
<Woet>	tejasmanohar: ?
<tejasmanohar>	Woet: http://codepen.io/tejasmanohar/pen/NqGOVB
<Woet>	tejasmanohar: so you didn't read the second link I sent you. I recommend you do.
<Flonk>	So yeah, that totally just didn't take me an hour to figure out. http://imgur.com/ZH8fxHY
<Flonk>	Why the hell would javascript employ string sorting on a list of numbers?
<tejasmanohar>	oh missed that message Woet
<tejasmanohar>	one sec
<rcyr>	Cthulchu: It's pretty bad for JS...
<robdubya>	if you want a full on IDE, webstorm is pretty great.
<Woet>	Flonk: maybe you should consider reading the docs first
<Woet>	Flonk: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
<tejasmanohar>	Woet: so http://codepen.io/tejasmanohar/pen/NqGEKL ?
<Flonk>	Woet: just because it's documented doesn't mean it's less nuts
<Cthulchu>	I need something to highlight the syntax while I'm coding. Does webstorm do that?
<Woet>	Flonk: it is nuts you spent 1 hour on something clearly mentioned by the docs though.
<Woet>	tejasmanohar: if you use iOS 8, yes.
<tejasmanohar>	Woet: i can do an operating system check from browser first and then give the appropriate link :)
<Flonk>	Woet: my code is a little large, that's not the first place I'd assume a bug. What's the rationale behind it though?
<Woet>	tejasmanohar: yes
<Woet>	Flonk: i'm not sure.
<Cthulchu>	oh, right... Eclipse conflicts with html :)
<Cthulchu>	It accepts only JS, which is not very good as I use it with html
<Cthulchu>	I'll try phpstorm
*	innociv_ is now known as sadtaco
<tejasmanohar>	Woet: Thanks! dude it works
<tejasmanohar>	why is that undocumented
<Woet>	call Apple?
<Woet>	just the fact its not mentioned doesn't mean "Apple says you cant on the docs so nvm"
<Flonk>	Woet: well, maybe it's because if you have an array of mixed types, at least some sorting can occur. generally !(number > string) and !(number < string) either (although sometimes it is), for example
<Flonk>	Ugh, better not think too hard about it

<lebster>	in this example, why do we set the contractor back to robot. I would like to see the difference    https://jsfiddle.net/5pLLr9Lf/
<stanford_drone>	Our startup got funded! We're going to Shenzhen, China to build a personal gaming drone. This is a flying robot that you can play with.

If you know any good programmer available from July to October please let me know! Send a resume at
<stanford_drone>	roitman@cs.stanford.edu or message me.
<falafel>	I'm sure we know some linux JS programmers in here
<cool_boy>	how do I terminate _.each after once I reach on line 17 https://gist.github.com/anonymous/531b45bd24d7ca813ef7
<webdex>	JS is the superior language
<lebster>	seems like the constructor works just fine without changing it back ? https://jsfiddle.net/5pLLr9Lf/1/
<cool_boy>	okay I did that setting a flag
<jaawerth>	falafel: you rang?
<falafel>	jaawerth, uh?
<jaawerth>	haha somethinga bout linux js programmers
<mmmveggies>	what about us:?
<jaawerth>	I dunno
<mmmveggies>	other than the fact that we're the hipsterest hipsters
<jaawerth>	lol
<jaawerth>	aka want a unixy environment but don't want to pay for a mac
<mmmveggies>	ah. yeah you can't beat the macbook on laptops
<jaawerth>	eh, when it comes to getting work done I really like my environment
<mmmveggies>	well I just use vim (I did say hipster) so there's not much of a difference
<jaawerth>	well I mean, there's your window manager
<mmmveggies>	I would be happy to use a netbook if they didn't like gameboys
<GreenJello>	I use ed
<falafel>	I just use free software, so mac is not an option
<mmmveggies>	feel like *  bleh
<GreenJello>	how many hipster points do I get?
<falafel>	but osx isn't that great anyway, I rather use linux
<jaawerth>	and yeah, I like having instant access to a all the free software
<jaawerth>	plus I like Cinnamon better than the MacOS desktop environment
<GreenJello>	I've yet to break my mac after a year, which beats my linux record of 4 months
<mmmveggies>	I thought you were arguing *for* macs.
<jaawerth>	the difference is you can fix linux without when it breaks ;-)
<jaawerth>	without nuking and paving*
<GreenJello>	you mean *you* can fix linux :-)
<jaawerth>	lol
<mmmveggies>	there's no better laptop, I'll agree. I bought a gaming laptop when I went to college and it was the biggest mistake I ever made, damn thing weighs 8 pounds and has 1.5 hours on battery max.
<GreenJello>	I only used it for a few years, so I was still a noob
<jaawerth>	fair enough
<jaawerth>	I'm pretty sure I learned by aggressively breaking things
<jaawerth>	(I still learn that way!)
<GreenJello>	mac really isn't much different from linux
<jaawerth>	yeah I know
<jaawerth>	in college I left my campus IT job for a while and when I wanted back in they only needed a mac guy so I was all "I can be a mac guy" and had to learn how to tool around 'em a bit
<thisthat>	Im trying to understand this inside object now i get stuck can someone help me out with the this keyword http://pastie.org/10174936
<Havvy>	!this @ thisthat
<ecmabot>	thisthat: If a function call is of the form `a.b()`, `this` will be the object you accessed the "b" property from. Otherwise, if it's of the form `a()`, `this` will be `undefined`, which is turned into the global object if the function isn't in strict mode. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/08/30/understanding-javascripts-this/
<Havvy>	thisthat:  Two recommendations.
<Havvy>	1. *ALWAYS* prefer `{}` to `new Object()`  [and corollary: prefer `[]` to `new Array()`]
<Havvy>	2. Just reference `test` directly instead of using `this`.
*	welly[work] is now known as welly[work][away
<thisthat>	Havvy: yes but if i want multiply uses
<thisthat>	thats why I want to learn the this
<falafel>	thisthat, new Object has no use, and new Array neither, in any case you'd use the constructors as functions, without `new`
<falafel>	that is a use case, that doesn't come often
<falafel>	so {} and [] is the way 99.99% of the time
<jaawerth>	uugh I need to talk to a tableau expert. I put together a database for this tableau guy to pull from and he's insisting that I need to drop all superfluous columns
<jaawerth>	which just seems totally contrary to how a relational DB works
<thisthat>	falafel:  what is the correct way to d this can you show me a example
<falafel>	thisthat, to do what?
<thisthat>	this one http://pastie.org/10174937
<falafel>	thisthat, always use {}
<thisthat>	falafel:  yes but that doenst also do the fix
<falafel>	thisthat, if you are learning, that's the best advice, new Object has no use case, again, but new Array has some valid use cases
<mattsfrey>	hello, I was hoping to get a book recommendation for javascript, preferably something very up to date that encompasses some of the front end frameworks possibly, but overall just the best overall JS book people have read
<mattsfrey>	any recommendations?
<falafel>	thisthat, what is `test.setHeigth`? it doesn't exist
<rcyr>	mattsfrey: Eloquent Javascript is often the recommended book here.
<falafel>	thisthat, do you mean `obj.setHeight.call(test, 10)`
<rcyr>	mattsfrey: As for lib/framework books, they're always outdated so there's none.
<falafel>	btw is height, not heigth
<mattsfrey>	lol, yeah that makes sense
<mattsfrey>	thanks rcyr i'll check it out
<rcyr>	You're welcome
<mattsfrey>	mostly just looking to get a hard copy of something for night reading before bed
<mattsfrey>	been writing JS at work with node etc but would like to get a deeper understanding of JS on the web from end to end
<rcyr>	mattsfrey: Learn how the prototypes work, how "this" works in JS, understand hoisting rules.
<rcyr>	mattsfrey: Learn to use ES5 as much as possible.
<mattsfrey>	is es6 considered bad practice atm?
<mattsfrey>	or it would just pay dividends to know how to do things "old school" for compatibility reasons?
<rcyr>	mattsfrey: Avoid for loops as much as possible... Use Object.keys to iterate on object properties, not for/in. Use .forEach/.map/.reduce/.filter to iterate on arrays
<rcyr>	mattsfrey: ES6 is unusable "natively" right now, the standard isn't even released
<rcyr>	_BUT_
<rcyr>	You can use a ES6 to ES5 precompiler like Babel
<rcyr>	That's what I do and it works wonderfully well
<mattsfrey>	my coworker who is more up to speed has us using es6 with babel/gulp etc atm
<mattsfrey>	oic
<rcyr>	If you know ES5, you can learn most of the interesting parts of ES6 in 30 minutes

<fullstack>	I need some algorithm architecture advice
<rcyr>	What is algorithm architecture?
<fullstack>	I'm writing an algorithm that matches people with people. Each person has a profile.
<fullstack>	rcyr perhaps that wasn't the best way to word it but I'd like to hear any suggestions to my problem
<fullstack>	so, person.age and person.zip code and perhaps person.gender.  I want a person.match [] that points to other people that match those items
<fullstack>	I have a bunch of .map/.sort/.indexOf/.forEach, but it just gets confusing after the third level or so of a join
<falafel>	fullstack, post the code

<falafel>	fullstack, can you try posting a demo, with some dummy input/output and what do you expect?
<fullstack>	falafel, that code is 100% a demo
<fullstack>	oh.. you need npm firebase
<fullstack>	falafel, but I might not need to give you a demo if you can give me a few suggestions. The last attempt I tried using the delete keyword (with some fumbly bit for finding the index), but having some issues with that
*	Mmango is now known as BeautifulCacti
<falafel>	fullstack, I mean, if this is about an algorithm, it is about data structures, can;t you abstract the problem from the actual use case, and use dummy input/ouputs in jsfiddle, then share a working link?
<fullstack>	falafel, sure yeah thanks.
<falafel>	fullstack, usually in the way of doing that you find better solutions by yourself, happens all the time

<andrew39>	fullstack, thanks
<fullstack>	falafel, alright this might be easier to read: http://jsfiddle.net/fkfz7nbc/
<fullstack>	errr, its printing null for matches...
<falafel>	fullstack, well, looks better, what should matches be?
<fullstack>	if zipcode is the same, and if one of the available times matches, and if one of the foods the same and true
<falafel>	fullstack, so it would contain profile objects?
<fullstack>	the first two should match each other. the third one (no zip code) shouldn't match anything. and the fourth one should match #3
<fullstack>	falafel, yes, or at least the data.username (not in json)
*	morlenxus is now known as Guest58160
<falafel>	fullstack, why do you have {profile: {a, b, c}} instead of {a, b, c} directly?
<falafel>	why the nesting?
*	morle is now known as morlenxus
<fullstack>	because there is other data in the real system
<fullstack>	for that user
<falafel>	ah
<fullstack>	I guess so to speak, this is going to get more and more complex. I need a matching strategy that is flexible
<falafel>	fullstack, so what would be an example output for matches, given the fiddle doesn't work?
<fullstack>	for profile #1, match : [ profile2 ], for profile #2, match : [ profile1, profile4], profile#3 match: none, profile#4 match:[profile#2]
<fullstack>	oh, and if anywhere any of the profile data changes, it needs to update.. .somewhat efficient but that doesn't really matter now
<fullstack>	Should I look into lodash? or what about I cram the data into rethinkdb and spit it out?
<falafel>	fullstack, I'd get an array of profiles first thing, [{userZip:12345, availableTimes:[],foods:[]}, {...}]
<falafel>	it'd be easier to work with, if what you need are profile objects anyway right?
<fullstack>	well let me update it real quick. The username, which is the same level as profile, I need as well. lemme edit that real quick..
<fullstack>	http://jsfiddle.net/fkfz7nbc/1/
<fullstack>	so no, i can't really simplify that way (see update re: username key)
<falafel>	fullstack, so you need the full object {username, profile: {}}
<falafel>	?
<fullstack>	in match? no. but thats how I wrote it
<fullstack>	username is unique so it could be just match : [ username1, username2, username3 ]
<falafel>	ah, so just usernames
<fullstack>	But there are some complex things like, if the user has 3 food matches, it needs to rank higher..
<fullstack>	then a user with only two food matches.
<fullstack>	and dozens of other rankings. lat/long, area, history. So that brings me back to an overall strategy of the matching problem in general. thats why I'm open to suggestions for ideas.   Basically once I get three levels down, my brain turns into bubble bath mix :)

<falafel>	fullstack, how are you handling circular references in JSON though?
<fullstack>	sounds like a bad bond movie
<fullstack>	falafel, I'm not..
<falafel>	fullstack, mmm, and you don't get an error converting circular structures to JSON?
<fullstack>	no. most likely because of firebase
<fullstack>	they dumb'd it down
<falafel>	fullstack, you must not be using the same object then, I mean, the same profile object that contains the username and such
<fullstack>	falafel, there aren't any "new" keywords though?
<falafel>	fullstack, what does that mean?
<fullstack>	if its not new, then it has to be existing, and if its existing, then its the same object, no?

*	welly[work] is now known as welly[work][away
<rcyr>	You would probably load an array of "users" then you would iterate on it to create you dictionary
<rcyr>	var dictionary = users.reduce(function(dict, user) { dict[user.username] = user; return dict; }, {}); //something like that
<rcyr>	Then after, you can easily access a user by its username by doing var user = dictionary[theUsername];

Each of the blue or grey boxes are buttons, and I want a bunch of different permutations to all communicate the same thing. I know that's kinda confusing, please take a look. I graduate in 2 days and this prototype is a big part of my show.

<dhnaranjo>	I'm more looking for strategy than actual code.
<hagb4rd>	dhnaranjo: communicate the same thing is like 'call the same function'?
<dhnaranjo>	Represent the same value. This is a digital prototype of a model for data collection through scratch lottery tickets. So like, each click is permanent and people might interpret the instructions differently.

<ezakimak>	all of that styling can be achieved via css and classes
<dhnaranjo>	Oh, the styling I have. The event handling for clicks too. I'm p proud, I touched html/css for the first time three days ago.
<hagb4rd>	dhnaranjo: i have a slight clue you may want to syncronize the datamodel with the viewmodel properly
<RLa>	holy fuck what chrome 42 did with bookmarks
<ezakimak>	i didn't notice--never use them in chrome
<hagb4rd>	so.. like there are 3 things representing the same 'lotteryticket' for example, and the ticket changes.. all 3 get updated visually.. does it go your way?
<hagb4rd>	@ dhnaranjo
<RLa>	i have over 4k bookmarks and notice as i cannot find anything
<hagb4rd>	i don't see how this is a technical program, while you understand your lotterymachine^^
<RLa>	the first screen shows everthing smashed together, without folders
<dhnaranjo>	Hrmm...
<ezakimak>	i have that problem in konqy and ff
<dhnaranjo>	I think I'll have to think about how to even phrase this before I go looking for help. I appreciate the look, y'all.
<hagb4rd>	dhnaranjo: are you familiar with angularJS?
<hagb4rd>	kay
<RLa>	ff goes infinite loop with xmarks, so i do not use it for bookmarks
<ezakimak>	ko might be easier for something this small
<ezakimak>	or even just simple plain js
<RLa>	i guess it's from stupid mac Finder design that smashes all files together too
<dhnaranjo>	Ok, so this thing I'm making, it is a digital prototype of an actual, PHYSICAL, scratch ticket.
<dhnaranjo>	It just so happens that printing custom tickets are 500 units minimum at like 90 cents a unit.
<dhnaranjo>	So conceive of every button as a radio button, a one way click.
<dhnaranjo>	So while it would be great if the user followed instructions and, in order to represent a 5, just scratched the number 5.
<dhnaranjo>	But SOME of them will scratch 1-5. Some will scratch 6-8. Some will scratch everything BUT 5.
<hagb4rd>	so far so good
<dhnaranjo>	Each of these can reasonably be understood to be 5. I have NO idea how to accomplish that.
<hagb4rd>	the last sentence doesn't make sense to me
<dhnaranjo>	I've got the CSS/html, I've got the click events, I just don't have any idea how to... even approach this particular issue.
<hagb4rd>	can it be "understood" to be 42 as well? :P
<dhnaranjo>	Haha, yes.
<hagb4rd>	please just that last sentence
<hagb4rd>	i can't make any sense of oit
<ezakimak>	me either
<hagb4rd>	for now i have just a set of numbers being true/false on each ticket a user may have
<dhnaranjo>	Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
<dhnaranjo>	When the user gets the ticket, everything is blue.
<ezakimak>	i don't understand how anything besides 5 should mean 5
<ezakimak>	which blue?
<dhnaranjo>	This isn
<dhnaranjo>	Either blue.
<dhnaranjo>	Uhg, I'm sorry.
<ezakimak>	why are there two blues?
<ezakimak>	just row alternation?
<hagb4rd>	can we leave out the aesthetics?
<hagb4rd>	when its relevant.. what else can it get?
<ezakimak>	well, i'm asking if there's a functional significance to diff colors
<dhnaranjo>	Grey means scratched off. Think of it as clicked.
<hagb4rd>	yep, exctly
<ezakimak>	ok
<dhnaranjo>	Blue, either blue, means not scratched off.
<ezakimak>	got it
<dhnaranjo>	Blue is 0, grey is 1.
<NBhosting>	this discussion doesnt make any sence to me :P
<hagb4rd>	so let's keep that
<hagb4rd>	there is no discussion NBhosting
<hagb4rd>	lol
<ezakimak>	oh, i get the comment now, but i don't get why it's true
<ezakimak>	ok, i think by making it so "flexible" for stupid users, you're actually making it a much poorer UI
<ezakimak>	why do you have such a complicated way to select a number between 1 and 8?
<dhnaranjo>	I don't have a complicated way to select it.
<dhnaranjo>	The instructions clearly indicate you scratch the box that corresponds to the number.
<dhnaranjo>	But.
<ezakimak>	accepting all four of those states as meaning 5 is complicated.
<ezakimak>	so only the 1st one should be valid.
<dhnaranjo>	I am willing to believe some people will not rerad the instructions and make assumptions.
<ezakimak>	so give them an *error*
<dhnaranjo>	It's a physical medium, a one shot, with a specific focus on not alienating people who don't necessarily follow instructions/read forms.
<dhnaranjo>	So every possible effort is given to... helping people get past fucking up.
<ezakimak>	how's the saying go? "try to make something foolproof, and a bigger fool will come along"?
<dhnaranjo>	Alright well.
<dhnaranjo>	I'd really, really appreciate.
<ezakimak>	ok. so whatever. I see that you're trying to represent some physical real world problem
<ezakimak>	what is the actualy javascript issue then?
<hagb4rd>	i think you should put a good readable, and most of all well thought-of (not like here ..lol) instruction visible all the time
<ezakimak>	sounds like he has, but must assume people are just dumb as rocks. (not untrue)
<hagb4rd>	or witty
<hagb4rd>	it's for his presentation
<dhnaranjo>	It's the approach in general. I'm just... having trouble getting a plan here. I mean, if I was ONLY accepting the correct input you'd click one button, I'd save its value to a variable, bam, no problem.
<hagb4rd>	butß?
<ezakimak>	all you need to do is examine the final state
<ezakimak>	every button click causes it to evaluate, what is the state?
<lalaland1125>	^
<ezakimak>	update the one button clicked, and call whatever()
<hagb4rd>	you can validate on each move (it's not more work at all) signilizing it won't be valid.. like with a color
<dhnaranjo>	Christ, I am continuing to not give you all enough information.
<ezakimak>	so, 8 click handlers that set a boolean (maybe in a single array), and one function called by each that looks at the array
<ezakimak>	or even 1 click handler, since the event will have the element from which you can get which button was clicked
<hagb4rd>	when it comes to psychology: users don't like to be overdrawn..like actions blocked or violently overwritten
<hagb4rd>	but of course
<hagb4rd>	there are limits to nonsense
<hagb4rd>	within sanity
<dhnaranjo>	Ok, the card is calculated all at once, not continually evaluated.
<ezakimak>	why?
<crillegustafsson>	Hi, I got this code -> http://jsfiddle.net/makzan/ubcnc/
<ezakimak>	what's the difference, and how do you know when they are done with it?
<dhnaranjo>	Because that's the functional model of the real thing.
<dhnaranjo>	There's a button.
<crillegustafsson>	how to remove the mirror action ?
<ezakimak>	but this is a demo I thought?
<dhnaranjo>	It is.
<dhnaranjo>	I'm an industrial designer.
<ezakimak>	ok, so even easier, you only call whatever() from that button
<dhnaranjo>	My actual job is to demonstrate the thing being done.
<dhnaranjo>	Not being a concept.
<ezakimak>	same amount of code really
<dhnaranjo>	Alright, hey, I'm totally not making myself clear, probably because I'm graduating in like... 36 hours and still sitting here working on my thesis.
<dhnaranjo>	So.
<dhnaranjo>	I appreciate y'alls effort to help.
<dhnaranjo>	Be well.
<hagb4rd>	good luck
<crillegustafsson>	How to remove Mirror action --> http://jsfiddle.net/makzan/ubcnc/
<hagb4rd>	keep in mind: less is more
<crillegustafsson>	its a question =)
<hagb4rd>	you should prefer to make it stable, instead of awesome
<hagb4rd>	unless it's a video presentation
<hagb4rd>	prerendered demo ..lol
<ezakimak>	crillegustafsson, don't draw the 3 you don't want
<ezakimak>	lines 49-52 are doing your drawing
<ezakimak>	49 is the only one you need
<crillegustafsson>	just remove number 3 ?
<ezakimak>	comment out 50-52
<crillegustafsson>	oh nice =)
<crillegustafsson>	thx
<Maxdamantus>	3's my lucky number.
<ezakimak>	I read once that the most efficent number system would have radix 2.9-something, so round to 3
<ezakimak>	can you imagine using base-3 for everything?
<ezakimak>	I think base 12 would be an improvement over 10
<ezakimak>	more factors
<hagb4rd>	that's for sure
<hagb4rd>	more fingers
<Maxdamantus>	The base = fingers thing is silly.
<ezakimak>	isn't that where it came from though?
<Maxdamantus>	It's much more efficient counting in binary on your fingers.
<Maxdamantus>	Probably, yes.
<ezakimak>	true
<ezakimak>	some abacusses are base 5 aren't they?
<Maxdamantus>	in binary, you can count to 31 on one hand, 1023 on two.
<hagb4rd>	well.. fortuantly absolutely not relevant anymore
<Maxdamantus>	What's not?
<ezakimak>	ppl that know how can do math on abacusses *very* fast
<ezakimak>	way faster than punching in stuff on a 4-function calculator
<hagb4rd>	i mean yea. if you have fun calculating without a calc
<Maxdamantus>	Finger counting? Finger counting is probably still the most effective way to count conscious things.
<hagb4rd>	sure
<hagb4rd>	also.. it's quite a dramatic gesture
<hagb4rd>	with good background music
<hagb4rd>	and a comitted expression in the face
<Maxdamantus>	eg, if someone asked me on the street how many letters were in "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious", I could give an answer.
<ezakimak>	I would, but it probably wouldn't be numerical
<hagb4rd>	>>"supercalifragilisticexpialidocious".split('').length
<ecmabot>	hagb4rd: (number) 34
<ljharb>	the answer is a spoonful of sugar, obvs
<Maxdamantus>	That's what I got from finger counting.
<hagb4rd>	my cpu lied
<hagb4rd>	-confessions-
<ezakimak>	you have 34 fingers? what planet are you from??
<ezakimak>	ever been to roswell?
<Maxdamantus>	No. I have ten, but I only needed to use six of them.
<hagb4rd>	not yet
<hagb4rd>	smoking?
<Maxdamantus>	2⁶ = 64
<Maxdamantus>	which is more than needed to count to 34.
<ezakimak>	yeah, but you can't do that with one hand
<Maxdamantus>	I could do it with one hand.
<hagb4rd>	stage hand(tm)
<ezakimak>	not 64
<Maxdamantus>	It's easy to remember at least an extra 0 or 1.
<Maxdamantus>	ie, whether you've overflowed or not.
<hagb4rd>	overflow bit.. toe
<Maxdamantus>	https://gist.github.com/raw/936ad0c6c3d06e8c309e/binfingers.mkv
<Maxdamantus>	Something I prepared earlier.
<ezakimak>	you've practiced that.
<ezakimak>	you'd confuse anyone deaf though.
<Maxdamantus>	Of course. I sometimes actually use it.
<ezakimak>	and you have to choose little or big endian
<Maxdamantus>	If I want to count something I can iterate consciously, I'll do that.
<Maxdamantus>	endianness is a false attribute here.
<ezakimak>	what is your bit order--it matters
<Maxdamantus>	You need to choose which fingers represent which binary digits.
<ezakimak>	and which hand is bits 0-5 and which 6-10
<Maxdamantus>	endianness is something else.
<Maxdamantus>	endianness involves ordering of notable subwords.
<ezakimak>	that is also a form of endianness, last I checked
<Maxdamantus>	It doesn't make sense to talk about ordering of bits in a byte on most CPUs today.
<Maxdamantus>	because there is no "first bit"
<ezakimak>	some address down to the nibble, or do BCD
<Maxdamantus>	If they do, they'll be special arithmetic instructions, not address instructions.
<ezakimak>	usually, yes.
<Maxdamantus>	ie, get the high nibble of this byte.
<Maxdamantus>	not "get the first 4 bits of this byte"
<Maxdamantus>	bit ordering isn't endianness.
<ezakimak>	but it matters anytime there's serialization
<ezakimak>	ethernet has not only byte ordering but bit ordering too
<Maxdamantus>	It doesn't matter if you're doing it arithmetically.
<Maxdamantus>	It's up to ethernet to describe the order then, and it's not a description of endianness.
<ezakimak>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#.22Bit_endianness.22
<ezakimak>	it's called "bit endianness"
<Maxdamantus>	You can call it that if you want.
<Maxdamantus>	but bit endianness isn't actual endianness.
<ezakimak>	sure it is
<ezakimak>	i'm not the only one
<lalaland1125>	You can't address individual bits so bit endianess is not a thing.
<ezakimak>	see the wp section on it
<ezakimak>	it is a thing.
<lalaland1125>	Isn't a thing on CPUs*
<ezakimak>	i've built serial hardware chips
<ezakimak>	software that drives serial hardware chips have to be aware of it
<ezakimak>	*usually* the chips are made so that the software doesn't have to worry about it, but not always.
<ezakimak>	the hardware must of course always do it correctly
<javascript663>	Hello to everyone. I wrote a little program that add several "<script src = '.../js.js'></script>" to the HEAD element. My browser, Firefox, finds very well the scripts : I can read their src-code with Firebug. But FF doesn't seem to interpret the JS code. The scripts contains declarations of objects, and I've got the error "object_1 is undefined". It's unlogical.
<javascript663>	Someone could help me pls ?
<ezakimak>	what is the "little program" written in?
<javascript663>	ezakimak: of course : https://jsfiddle.net/gfk8je9f/
<javascript663>	ezakimak: the call is here : <head lang="en"> 	<script type = "text/javascript" src = "Stats_Module.js"></script> </head>
<ezakimak>	that's an unconventional way to do it, for sure
<ezakimak>	wth. jsfiddle won't let me type a period--it deletes instead
<ezakimak>	https://jsfiddle.net/gfk8je9f/1/
<ezakimak>	but, why are you computing and calculating the names of your scripts, why not just know their names already?
<javascript663>	ezakimak: because I don't want to type a majuscule (shift + letter), or underscore (too far...)
<javascript663>	ezakimak: :-/
<javascript663>	ezakimak: your code has the same issue :/
<ezakimak>	i believe the problem is that the document has already loaded.
<ezakimak>	are you using jquery?
<javascript663>	ezakimak: yes
<ezakimak>	https://jsfiddle.net/gfk8je9f/2/
<javascript663>	ezakimak: Error: require() could not load script: js-scripts_inc/overlay/Super_Type_Tree.js 	  throw new Error("require() could not load script: " + script);  	
<javascript663>	ezakimak: :/
<javascript663>	ezakimak: moreover my scripts aren't added to the HEAD of my page ^^
<ezakimak>	https://jsfiddle.net/gfk8je9f/3/ ?
<f3lp>	folks, how can I check the http method of a xhr?
<ezakimak>	why do you need the added to the head?
<javascript663>	ezakimak: ReferenceError: Super_Type is not defined :-/
<javascript663>	ezakimak: it's more proper to add scripts on head no ? :p
<Expel>	Could anyone explain what does this error mean, how could I solve it? http://masonry.desandro.com/faq.html#error-cannot-call-methods-on-masonry-prior-to-initialization-attempted-to-call-___
<ezakimak>	Super_Type is your code
<javascript663>	ezakimak: Super_Type is the name of the .JS file AND the name of the class the .JS file contains
<fullstack>	Expel, don't know what Masonry is but it seems you have some kind of async issue , gut feeling
<ezakimak>	right, so it loaded the js file and had an error trying to execute it. so it worked.
<ezakimak>	it loaded.
<javascript663>	ezakimak: each of the scripts I want to import contains a class
<javascript663>	ezakimak: ??srsly ?
<ezakimak>	now you need to debug it.
<Expel>	fullstack: Alright, got you. It tells me in the FAQ that I've to trigger the function, but It seems not to work out as expected...
<javascript663>	ezakimak: ok thanks :)
<javascript663>	ezakimak: so I have to debug the Super_Types.js ?
<ezakimak>	yw, and gl
<ezakimak>	yes
<ezakimak>	that's my guess
<javascript663>	ok
<ezakimak>	the debugger should say what file the error is in
<javascript663>	nice, thank you !
<javascript663>	nope
<ezakimak>	what browser you using??
<average>	the best browser.. of course..
<javascript663>	ezakimak: FF with firebug
<ezakimak>	ncsa mosaic??
<average>	haha, mosaic
<fullstack>	Expel,  is Masonry Free? like Free Masonry? is it 33rd degree? :) heh
<ezakimak>	I remember using it.
<ezakimak>	isn't masonry a tiling library?
<average>	masonry is a profession too
<ezakimak>	and a religion
<average>	yes
<fullstack>	http://masonry.desandro.com/ it looks like eyecandy layout stuff
<joker89>	Hi
<Expel>	fullstack: Lol, yes, it's completely free. IsoTope isn't free
<ezakimak>	gn ppl.
<fullstack>	its what you use when you want to charge clients the big bucks.
<javascript663>	ezakimak: hmmm my files are 100% correct
<joker89>	How can i prevent blur event when i click on the submit button? I've blur events for thr form inputs to validate at the time and show or hide messages

<javascript663>	ezakimak: so the SuperType.js's code works very well
<javascript663>	ezakimak: it's my little program which add the scripts to the HEAD that doesn't work :-)

<Che-Anarc>	Is there a performance comparison of ===  vs == operator? - I'm being told that "===" is always better since its faster? - is this necessarily true?
<GreenJello>	Che-Anarc, if there's a performance difference it's negligible
<GreenJello>	=== is less confusing though, so you should use that
<Che-Anarc>	GreenJello,   I can understand where there might be a potential type difference... but I was more interested if the claim to performance difference can potentially be true.
<GreenJello>	Che-Anarc, maybe? but it's like a million times faster than changing a class name on an element, so it really doesn't matter

Fortunately most tasks have been rather easy with some simple googling and co worker conversation. I do have an issue with a current page where a function seems to be getting called despite no one clicking it
<Jesperhead>	never* rather than no one i suppose
<Jesperhead>	some more background: these pages are for an android app. The native app being more of a wrapper than anything else, though it does pull data that is later plugged into these pages.
<Jesperhead>	various elements on this page are being .show() or .hide() depends on the user data.
<Jesperhead>	Is there anything in .show() or .hide() that might cause the function tagged (with .click()) to execute upon being shown?

<javascript282>	mllbp: if you need something else, just ask me !
<D[4]ni_>	This is in the source: if ( parsed ) {return [ context.createElement( parsed[1] ) ]; }
<D[4]ni_>	some lines above that: context = context || document;
<javascript282>	mllbp: I updated again : https://jsfiddle.net/bzqcgsqr/2/ is the good link
<mllbp>	javascript282, any more updates :PP
<javascript282>	mllbp: ^^'
<Hoyt>	D[4]ni_: Awesome ..
<xqo>	what is that method you're supposed to use to check for types again
<xqo>	its like Object.prototype.something.tostring "[object Array]"
<xqo>	or something like that
<mllbp>	javascript282, your html?
<D[4]ni_>	xqo: typeof foo === 'string' ?
<D[4]ni_>	xqo: Object.prototye.toString.call(foo)
<xqo>	yes, thank you
<D[4]ni_>	prototype*
<xqo>	is it very slow or something? you dont see it used very often
<javascript282>	mllbp: very small code : https://jsfiddle.net/bzqcgsqr/3/ ^^'
<D[4]ni_>	xqo: You probably want to use foo instanceof Array
<xqo>	D[4]ni_ why?
<mllbp>	javascript282, that is not html
<mllbp>	I mean it is js copied into html

<javascript282>	mllbp: o.O
<mllbp>	try to run it with jsfiddle run
<D[4]ni_>	xqo: It's about 10x faster than Object.prototype.toString and accounts for subclasses (or however you call them in prototype language)

<mllbp>	i refreshed before you linked it :D
<xqo>	but sometimes i've been told to use it

<mllbp>	javascript282, I still can't see the errors you experience in the console
<javascript282>	mllbp : that's normal, I have to put all my code if you want to see errors ^^'
<javascript282>	mllbp: i can do that
<mllbp>	that would be great so I can tweak it online
<mllbp>	and send you the correct code
<javascript282>	mllbp: okay :)
<mllbp>	javascript282 I told you there will be a 6th update :'D
<D[4]ni_>	xqo: If you're testing for primitives (like String or Number) it is recommended to use Object.prototype.toString: http://stackoverflow.com/a/10656437/1034669

<D[4]ni_>	xqo: If you don't need any subclasses, typeof is even faster though
<xqo>	D[4]ni_ you mean typeof faster than instanceof?
<javascript282>	mllbp: they are well displayed in my Firefox and that's not the problem. The problem is that Firefox tells me getData is not a function (for the classes Top_Axis and Left_Aix)s
<D[4]ni_>	xqo: typeof > instanceof > toString
<xqo>	thank you
<mllbp>	i don't look at the design javascript282, I can see an error that Super_Type is not defined which can break your code

<Novus>	morning
<episage>	hi guys, can you recommend a web framework which can load page and subpages asynchronously keeping slashes in url (for SEO sake)
<episage>	such as you have a main webpage at www.example.com
<episage>	and when you navigate to www.example.com/tour you get it instantly because it was fetched in the background
<episage>	and theres no reload white-page flashing to the user
<episage>	i think github had something like that
<Sharaal>	episage: sounds like single page application combined with static urls and seo?
<episage>	Sharaal: yeah, i need static urls for SEO sake, and i also want to load the page quickly
<episage>	like in one go or in some smart async way
<Sharaal>	you will need server side rendering too for SEO, so I would have a look at react which can solve both, single page app on clientside and serverside rendering if you using node.js
<episage>	Sharaal: do you think that routing in angular could solve this as well? im reading this: http://blog.getambassador.com/single-page-webapp-seo/
<episage>	like loead a main template and prefetch the rest in the background
<Sharaal>	angular is bad for this approach cause there is no server side rendering available
<RLa>	episage, did you read google guide on ajax crawling?
<episage>	RLa: im looking for it atm
<RLa>	imho, static file cache+reflow-free html loading would make pages "instantaneous" too
*	norm is now known as Guest50895
<episage>	RLa: thats good idea but what about AB tests? say if i want to change the page completely, i will need a framework for that, but server side or client side, im not sure
<RLa>	episage, i would do it on the server side
<episage>	RLa: can you recommend any frameworks?
<RLa>	also, you AB test certain pages or front page only?
<RLa>	nope
<episage>	it can be anything from the front page to landing pages
<RLa>	last time we used google analytics for that but it has extra latency before selecting which page to show
<RLa>	i think you could configure GA to send event of which page was selected and send another event when conversion happens
<RLa>	episage, i think you cannot make it too arbitrary
<RLa>	cant interpret results that way
<episage>	we tried google analytics too but we had too much "poison" in the data. like we had 2 other conversion rate measurers and the data was different every time
<episage>	it drives me crazy sometimes
<episage>	it was GA, Optimizely and some custom written system on server side
<episage>	conversion rates did not mattch either
<RLa>	i think you cant run multiple AB tests at the same time indeed
<episage>	yeah, thats what we did
<anand>	episage: try a micro framework at http://microjs.com/
<episage>	anand: checking it atm

<michaelis>	Hello. Anyone here had problems when using getBoundingClientRect() on svg element? First click shows correct value but after that it's the same value that's showing over and over again no matter where I click.
<lolmaus>	Is there a standard way to cocatenate parts of an URL together? I would like to avoid handling missing and double slashes manually.
<javascript778>	mllbp: Hey :p
<Sharaal>	lolmaus: what parts? have a look at URL.js: http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/
<quetzakubica>	does function has to always take some parameters in functional paradigm?
<RLa>	no it does not
<quetzakubica>	RLa, thanks, strange though, because haskell enforces it
<RLa>	it could get values through closures too
<RLa>	really, haskell does that?
<Maxdamantus>	quetzakubica: with laziness it might as well.
<Maxdamantus>	RLa: yes. Functions in Haskell all take exactly one argument.
<RLa>	i guess they just cannot represent 0-argument functions
<Maxdamantus>	What would a 0-argument function be?
<Maxdamantus>	a mapping from nothing to a single value?
<Maxdamantus>	ie, a single value.
<quetzakubica>	I have some domain behaviours like createBoard and board is always the same
<RLa>	hm
<quetzakubica>	but I want it in another function
<quetzakubica>	for readiness
<quetzakubica>	readability :P
<RLa>	not sure about the question
<RLa>	in js you can use no-argument functions
<RLa>	>> (function () { return "i take no argument" })()
<ecmabot>	RLa: (string) 'i take no argument'
<quetzakubica>	I know, I'm just curious how in haskell it would looks like
<RLa>	i guess in haskell it becomes a constant
<Maxdamantus>	quetzakubica: in Haskell you wouldn't bother with "createBoard". You'd just have a definition for an empty board.
<javascript778>	mllbp: I found my error ! There isn't any "bind" in Useful_Functions.js > extends_Droppable(...) > this.getData2 = droppable.getData(this);   <---- Change it to this.getData2 = droppable.getData.bind(this);   \o/
<RLa>	as there are no mutable variables anyway in haskell
<quetzakubica>	Maxdamantus: definition ? you mean a constant variable?
<Maxdamantus>	quetzakubica: all variables are constant in Haskell.
<RLa>	quetzakubica, so createBoard is just a constant
<RLa>	createBoard = []
<Maxdamantus>	No. `createBoard` is a bad name.
<RLa>	like that
<quetzakubica>	emptyBoard
<quetzakubica>	create is a behaviour
<Maxdamantus>	in FP you don't normally think about "creating" things.
<Maxdamantus>	the empty board always exists.
<Maxdamantus>	if the board is parametric, you think of all boards existing.
<Maxdamantus>	so `board 4 5` refers to a particular form of board.
<Maxdamantus>	you're still not creating anything.
<quetzakubica>	hmm
<quetzakubica>	so there is no factory functions in FP?
<quetzakubica>	well, in that sense there are
<Maxdamantus>	What's the difference between a factory function and a function?
<quetzakubica>	naming :D
<Maxdamantus>	"factory" is a name people use for a sometimes-useful hack in languages without functions.
<RLa>	btw, why are you discussing it here, not in #haskell?
<RLa>	is there something wrong with that channel
<quetzakubica>	factory is a pattern, because I'm writing in js using FP
<Maxdamantus>	it's a pattern that doesn't make sense in JS.
<Maxdamantus>	because JS has functions.
<Maxdamantus>	You can just write a function that yields the thing you want.
<quetzakubica>	python also has, yet it make sense
<Maxdamantus>	It doesn't really make sense in Python either.
<quetzakubica>	I think we are talking about something different
<zomg>	I wouldn't necessarily say factory is a useless pattern in JS
<zomg>	in some cases, it makes sense to separate object creation from the rest
<RLa>	i still think the confusion is about no-argument functions
<zomg>	it doesn't matter if you have a function for it or not, you can still call it a factory because it still works like the pattern - the creation is separated
<quetzakubica>	factory hides creation logic
<quetzakubica>	exactly
<Maxdamantus>	functions hide logic.
<zomg>	I'm sure you've seen the image that went around a while back
<zomg>	where it had OO concepts vs FP concepts, where everything said "functions" in FP
<zomg>	http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/11/24/FPvsOO.html
<zomg>	I liked this article Uncle Bob wrote about it
<quetzakubica>	yes, but if I talk with another programmer I won't say him it's a function that creates object foo
<quetzakubica>	but just it's a foo factory
<zomg>	His approach is quite pragmatic instead of just going religious on one side or the other :P
<RLa>	and modules in js are functions too
<quetzakubica>	and functions are objects :P
<Maxdamantus>	That's a language mistake.
<alboh>	l
*	Maxdamantus doesn't like this article.
<Maxdamantus>	It makes too many random assertions about terms.
<zomg>	Why am I not surprised =)
<Maxdamantus>	I think we should generally aim to reduce the number of meanings each term has, not increase it.
<Maxdamantus>	“Indeed, the word "variable" is a misnomer in a functional language because you cannot vary them.”
<Maxdamantus>	That's not what it's meant in mathematics for .. dunno how long.
<cool_boy>	if javascript allows to override a method with different  no of parameters eg: there is a method discount(), called from serveral places, I want it to be discount(type), without changing its many fuction calls?
<quetzakubica>	ok, but sayinf that function is a factory is just for ease og communication
<zomg>	quetzakubica: don't bother. It's the same as saying class, it's wrong because JS doesn't have classes even though it looks like a class as far as anyone with any common sense is concerned
<quetzakubica>	anyway I'm just begining with FP so I might change my mind about this
<Maxdamantus>	quetzakubica: have you heard the term "constructor"?
<quetzakubica>	Maxdamantus: why would I not?
<Maxdamantus>	quetzakubica: because I suspect it could probably apply to most cases you're thinking of calling "factory".
<Maxdamantus>	a factory is traditionally an object.
<Maxdamantus>	because you have languages that don't have functions, so you instead create objects that have methods that produce the things you want.
<quetzakubica>	Maxdamantus: yes, It might be that it is constructor in most cases. Factory uses constructor internally
<javascript778>	Maxdamantus: excuse-me ! Just, do you know if the jQuery UI's function "draggable()" can have a parameter to pass a variable (for example an object) ? :-/
<Maxdamantus>	javascript778: no.
<javascript778>	Maxdamantus: okay, np, thanks ! ^^
<Maxdamantus>	(I don't know)
<quetzakubica>	Maxdamantus: why factory is an object? it's some operation
<Maxdamantus>	quetzakubica: because it's an object-orientated pattern.
<quetzakubica>	I would say it's a creational pattern
<Maxdamantus>	quetzakubica: I didn't invent it. Someone else did.
<Maxdamantus>	quetzakubica: it's not for me or you to decide.
*	\mSg_mini is now known as \mSg
<Maxdamantus>	quetzakubica: again, try to avoid associating random meanings to words.
<Maxdamantus>	quetzakubica: otherwise you end up with people calling maps "hashes".
<quetzakubica>	Maxdamantus: actually factory is under creational patterns in GOF
<javascript778>	Maxdamantus: quetzakubica is true
<Maxdamantus>	quetzakubica: okay, and I suspect they describe factories as objects.
<quetzakubica>	yes
<Maxdamantus>	creational patterns are still patterns, if that's what you were wondering.

<inimino>	words
<quetzakubica>	whatever we will name it, it will do the same
<quetzakubica>	return data
<inimino>	cool_boy: did you figure it out?
<cool_boy>	inimino: yes I see it works
<cool_boy>	but will it give any issue?
<inimino>	cool_boy: it's normal
<inimino>	js> function f(a){return a} f()
<ecmabot>	inimino: undefined
<Maxdamantus>	js> function f(a){arguments[0] = 5; return a} f()
<ecmabot>	Maxdamantus: undefined
<Maxdamantus>	js> function f(a){arguments[0] = 5; return a} f(undefined)
<ecmabot>	Maxdamantus: (number) 5
<Maxdamantus>	didn't expect those to differ.
<lefoy>	anybody here?

<dostoyevsky>	> Some elements, however, are forbidden from containing any content at all. These are known as void elements. In HTML, the above syntax cannot be used for void elements. For such elements, the end tag must be omitted because the element is automatically closed by the parser. Such elements include, among others, br, hr, link and meta
<inimino>	right
<dostoyevsky>	but yeah I always feel a little confused when I see those tags :)
<cool_boy>	inimino: thanks for confirm

<knod>	inimino: Thank you for the answer. Any idea how those libraries go about it?
<inimino>	knod: the answers on that page about libraries refer to libraries which maintain their own lists
<knod>	inimino: Oh, so it only works for libraries that do that, not for the regular DOM?
<inimino>	there is no library that can retrieve event listeners added with addEventListener because the platform simply doesn't support it
<inimino>	right
<knod>	Dangit
<uberjar>	I'm just looking for a rough idea or estimate..   how much slowdown is involved between making 1 request for 60 objects vs 6 requests for 10 objects, etc
<knod>	Ok, thans inimino
<inimino>	or in the case of .onclick you can retrieve that
<inimino>	np
<knod>	You can?
<inimino>	yes
<inimino>	elm.onclick
<knod>	That returns a bool?
<knod>	Or however that's spelled. I never remember
<quetzakubica>	uberjar: it depends on how much time your backend needs
<inimino>	uberjar: with pipelining and to the same domain, not much
<inimino>	knod: no, it's a function
<knod>	inimino: Then how does that detect if an element has that event on it?
<inimino>	knod: you mean has that listener
<knod>	Yes, sorry
<inimino>	knod: if that is a function, it has that listener (and that function is the listener)
<inimino>	but it only work for listeners set using .onclick, obviously
<uberjar>	inimino: so.. would parsing 3 different strings into JSON use about as much CPU as parsing 1 larger string into json ?
<knod>	Ohhh, typeof elem.onclick === 'function'
<knod>	right
<knod>	Yeah, not what I was hoping for, but thanks for cluing me into that
<inimino>	uberjar: sure
<knod>	clueing
<knod>	Sheesh
<inimino>	I didn't notice that one :)
<uberjar>	inimino:  what about mobile battery life.. if you make 3 different requests then even though the aggregate data size is the same, more packets will be transmitted potentially leading to more overall radio TX right ?

<Havvy>	Unless you've measured and found a performance issue, you shouldn't try optimizing.

<Havvy>	So yeah, even if there was a do { ... } for (...) loop, it'd still be the wrong way to loop through an array.
<ilhami>	I started a discussion. :P
<ilhami>	yeah!
<jaawerth>	haha, do while is one of those things that every once in a while comes in handy
<jaawerth>	so I'm glad it's there, but I almost never use it
<cjohnson>	there was one time where I was really close to using it
<cjohnson>	but then I didn't
<Havvy>	I'd rather have `loop { ...; if (predicate) { break; } }` personally.
<cjohnson>	ew :)
<jaawerth>	well, I like while loops for certain kinds of flow control, but yeah, .forEach, .map, and .reduce are really what one should use for any sort of array/data structure operation
<jaawerth>	I will put in a special ES6 exception for for..of loops though
<natmyers1>	jaawerth: agreed
<jaawerth>	I find the syntax of for of to be nice and clean
<cjohnson>	I'm totally confused why they made that one syntax and the others prototype methods tho
<jaawerth>	hm?
<cjohnson>	oh I guess because it's on more than one prototype
<javascript778>	Havvy: nope you can
<jaawerth>	and its behavior is specific to what it's working on
<cjohnson>	just seemed inconsistent with all the other changes being introduced but I see why I guess
<jaawerth>	you mean for..of?
<cjohnson>	right
<jaawerth>	ah. well, it's a matter of consistency
<cjohnson>	well the behavior could change based on what it's working on with a method
<jaawerth>	you can make for..of into syntax because it will play nice with anything that supports iteration protocol
<jaawerth>	whereas any sort of .forEach needs specific behavior to what it's working on
<Havvy>	>> var array = [1, 2, 3];  do { console.log([i, array[i]]) } while (var ix = 0; ix < array.length; ix += 1)
<ecmabot>	Havvy: SyntaxError: syntax error
<jaawerth>	that's my understanding of it anyway
<javascript778>	Havvy: you are triching
<cjohnson>	well natively there's only one forEach right? so they could have just as easily made forEach a syntax
<jaawerth>	b> for (let i of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) console.log(i);
<cjohnson>	though I guess basically it would be redundant since for...of would do the same thing
<babelbot>	jaawerth: 1 2 3 4 5 undefined
<jaawerth>	nice and clean ;-)
<cjohnson>	and also forEach is ES5 so nevermind me entirely
<cjohnson>	lol
<ilhami>	anyone who is good at jquery?
<cjohnson>	I would have liked forEach to not be a function though if we had been able to predict the future when we wrote it
<cjohnson>	on the other hand, it's shimmable which is nice
<Sharaal>	ilhami: just ask what you want to ask ^^
<jaawerth>	b> for (let val of (function*() { yield 'Moe'; yield 'Larry'; yield 'Curly'; })()) console.log(val)
<babelbot>	jaawerth: Moe Larry Curly undefined
<ilhami>	I need a for loop inside an append method. :P
<ilhami>	is it possible?
<cjohnson>	where does the undefined come from
<cjohnson>	that's one thing generators still confuse me about
<jaawerth>	that's just the REPL
<cjohnson>	there's some sort of last-call or initial-call?
<jaawerth>	I'm not returning anything from the statement on the repl
<cjohnson>	oh it's trying to log the last value returned by console.log
<cjohnson>	ok
<jaawerth>	b> for (let val of (function*() { yield 'Moe'; yield 'Larry'; yield 'Curly'; })()) console.log(val); 'done';
<babelbot>	jaawerth: Moe Larry Curly done
<jaawerth>	it isn't logging anything
<jaawerth>	b> 'hi';
<babelbot>	jaawerth: hi
<jaawerth>	b>
<jaawerth>	haha it's too smart for that one
<natmyers1>	ilhami: as in you want to append a dynamic block of html?
<cjohnson>	whatever you want to call it. printing to the console is what I mean by "logging"
<cjohnson>	>> 'foo'
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: (string) 'foo'
<cjohnson>	logs the last returned val ^
<cjohnson>	that's all I mean
<cjohnson>	anyway, this article confused me http://davidwalsh.name/es6-generators
<jaawerth>	yeah hehe just wanted to make it clear it had nothing to do with my use of console.log
<ilhami>	natmyers1, I have an idea. :)
<ilhami>	I will just generate the html outside the append method return it and then append it with the other stuff. should be possible I guess. :P
<natmyers1>	ilhami: you can always do a $.append(generateHTML()) and put your loop in generateHTML()
<jaawerth>	cjohnson: yeah it's a little too busy, and it mixes too much code with conceptual stuff, plus the state machine behavior of generators and the iterator nature of the result should, to me, be discussed separately
<cjohnson>	the bit about return being basically a final yield which is discarded
<cjohnson>	something like that
<jaawerth>	ah gotcha
<ilhami>	natmyers1, yeah I was thinking about the same.
<cjohnson>	generators are too hectic for me. too much back and forth
<jaawerth>	cjohnson: well, that's less to do with generators than with how for of will talk to an iterator
<jaawerth>	think about them separately
<jaawerth>	an iterator is a thing that lets you call "next" and gives you { value: sometValue, done: true/false } as a result, right?
<cjohnson>	http://jsfiddle.net/nv7ws5zm/
<cjohnson>	no for..of here
<cjohnson>	but return is still part of the generator stuff
<jaawerth>	typically, you don't expect to have a usable value on an iterator when "done" is true
<jaawerth>	for...of loops will not even try to grab a value - once 'done' is hit, it won't process the value
<cjohnson>	ok that makes sense I just dont' get why return is treated as a yield
<cjohnson>	as in the fiddle
<jaawerth>	a generator is merely a function that pauses when you use "yield" and always returns an iterator
<jaawerth>	if you *don't* use return at all, the function still returns - and "done" is true, with value as undefined
<jaawerth>	explicitly using return thus causes return to occur and "done" to be true - you're exiting that function's callstack
<jaawerth>	it's just that if you return a value, "value" ends up being populated in the iterator
<jaawerth>	think of it as a cleanup valuie
<jaawerth>	so the right way to work with it, IMO, is to ignore the value when "done" is true unless you're explicitly looking for cleanup data
<cjohnson>	so is there a way to get the return value of the function without calling .next() a final time?
<jaawerth>	no, but you won't even know which "next" will be the final time until "done" is true
<cjohnson>	or does the function become something entirely unlike a function at that point
<cjohnson>	oh true
<jaawerth>	so all you have to do is check iter.done and, if it's true, you can either ignore the value or look for a cleanup val if one applies contextually
<cjohnson>	I think I'll prob wait for async, that seems more up my alley
<cjohnson>	no switching contexts back and forth
<cjohnson>	just nice clean sugar
<cjohnson>	prob entirely different but I also have no idea when a generator would really be helpful so I'm sure they're for entirely diff purposes
<jaawerth>	generators are way simpler than they appear, and the reason I love them is because of what all the cool ways you can use them to make arbitrary iterators
<jaawerth>	that's the thing, you don't have to think that hard about context unless you're trying to use goroutines
<jaawerth>	or coroutines
<cjohnson>	I just mean the back and forth nature of it
<jaawerth>	they're just functions that reduce into an iterator
<cjohnson>	code runs inside function, then goes back to the iterating code, then back into the function
<cjohnson>	hard to step through logically with my brain
<jaawerth>	I don't think of it as back and forth, I just think of it from the perspective of the code that's interacting with the iterator
<cjohnson>	well to copy a bit from that article I referenced: http://jsfiddle.net/52g6cb48/
<cjohnson>	you need to go in, apply the calculation, go out, see the output, modify it there, send a new input back in, go back to the code, see the next yield
<cjohnson>	etc
<cjohnson>	to work through it logically I wouldh ave to look at both teh function body and the code using the function
<cjohnson>	but then again, this is a contrived example, which may be part of the problem
<jaawerth>	yeah
<cjohnson>	but so far I haven't seen any generators where I went "ah! that's why you'd do that!"
<jaawerth>	I felt the exact same way as you until I 1) started to ignore co for a bit, since that's the shiniest application, and 2) played with them for a bit
<cjohnson>	do you have any examples of real world generator use that I could look at?
*	matthava` is now known as matthavard
<ilhami>	cjohnson, let's fight. :)
<eskatrem>	Hey, I am having some troubles understanding something with regexps in javascript, this returns null: /^\b_((?:__|[\s\S])+?)_\b|^\*((?:\*\*|[\s\S])+?)\*(?!\*)/.exec("this *is* it")   but I have some code here: https://github.com/chjj/marked/blob/master/lib/marked.js  (line 651) where it returns a match
<jaawerth>	well, I do have a plnkr where I was screwing around with the concept of a wrapper that'll reduce arbitrary values into iterators for doing lazy evaluation. it isn't really meant to be practical (and you can accomplish much of it without generators) but the neat thing about reducing things to iterators is you can easily do chained/lazy non-mutating operations (like nested object concatenation)
<cjohnson>	eskatrem: then the input is different than your test here
<cjohnson>	console.log the input to the regex and let's take a look what you're actually matching and how it differs from your test here
<eskatrem>	cjohnson: I thought so but I added some print statements
<eskatrem>	and they are the same
<ilhami>	there is a really good regex tester.
<ilhami>	its called
<ilhami>	https://regex101.com/
<ilhami>	best one I know of
<galtgendo>	OK, this is insane; AFAICT these two definitions should be equivalent, yet they aren't; sorry, but what the fuck -- www.pastebin.ca/2998941; ignore that '>>> 0' in one of them (it makes no difference)
<cjohnson>	either your inputs are differing your your regex is differing
<jaawerth>	cjohnson: http://plnkr.co/edit/KTQhsYTnUGgmXz5Bc3ZU?p=info take a look cat concat.js and objectToIterator in iterator.js and how I'm using them in the main wrap.js. Oh, and the last two methods in wrap.js as well
<eskatrem>	cjohnson: http://pastebin.com/eN5dNXd2 there
<jaawerth>	it's just a basic proof of concept but you can use the same idea to reduce *anything* to an iterator, synchronous or not, and of any data structure
<galtgendo>	it seems to be something with signed/unsigned
<jaawerth>	from there, you can perform any sort of operation on the resultant iterator, so you can basically use generators to reduce things of arbitrary complexity
<eskatrem>	I am sure I am doing something dumb...
<jaawerth>	the only thing you have to keep in mind is the general form of the returned .value property - whether it's a key/value pair or a single value, for example
<cjohnson>	galtgendo: you're using different arguments for different things
<eskatrem>	Ah, ok, I was missing something obvious, the string that was being matched was "*is* it", not "this *is* it"
<cjohnson>	eskatrem: ;)
<jaawerth>	cjohnson: CSP channels are a particularly neat application once you get your head around that concept. It's really just applying the same thing, only the go_ and go functions are passing *operations* via the iterator
<cjohnson>	galtgendo: your variable names suck, and your code is doing too many things on one line
<jaawerth>	cjohnson: this article covers a basic implementation of CSP (much simpler than js-csp) and walks through how it's actually implemented using generators http://swannodette.github.io/2013/08/24/es6-generators-and-csp/
<cjohnson>	I can't begin to understand which is which but right off the bat I see that your first line is using different positional arguments for that first comparison
<cjohnson>	so they aren't equivalent right there
<cjohnson>	cool jaawerth I'll take a gander
<jaawerth>	oh and all that code in the plnkr I linked you will run - I'm using traceur + SystemJS in there ;-)
<Shayanjm>	If I'm trying to identify different DOM elements and parsing text nodes -- how do I avoid parsing things inside script tags?
<galtgendo>	cjohnson: huh ?; I'm pretty much sure I'm using the same arguments, but even skipping '===' thing, I really can't see how these two versions of _Interpolate_2 would differ...
<cjohnson>	"parsing text nodes" how?
<ilhami>	var html += '<article>' + message[i] + '</article>'; why is this invalid?
<Shayanjm>	cjohnson: I walk the dom, determine if it's a text node, figure out if it contains something that I should care about (i.e: a phone number, url, something) - and wrap that thing inside of some new tags
<cjohnson>	galtgendo: you can't just say "skipping === thing they should be identical"
<Shayanjm>	the problem, though, is that it looks like script tags are text nodes
<cjohnson>	look at it though
<Shayanjm>	so the regex is matching javascript and wrapping tags around the stuff in there
<Shayanjm>	which is causing all sorts of problems
<cjohnson>	they're comparing c1 === c2, which in the first func are the first 2 args, but in the second func, are not the first 2 args
<cjohnson>	so right there, your functions already differ
<Shayanjm>	so ideally I'd like to just avoid even looking at script elements
*	greves is now known as Guest70766
*	Guest44313 is now known as greves
<cjohnson>	galtgendo: either way. your variable names suck and there's no way to tell what's going on here, so I can't begin to tell you what else is different
<cjohnson>	Shayanjm: if the textnode.parentNode.tagName.toLowerCase() === 'script', ignore
<cjohnson>	same with style
<Shayanjm>	awesome, thanks cjohnson
<ilhami>	never mind. solved it.
<kryo_>	hi i'm trying to add a style to a twitter "follow" button that i'm putting on my website
<galtgendo>	cjohnson: it seems you're talking about something obvious in js, but not in the slightest in C
<cjohnson>	jaawerth: haha, I'm still lost. too much generic stuff for me to really see practical application. like with promises, I got it as soon as they implemented an xhr function that returned a promise
<cjohnson>	galtgendo: I don't see how the language has to do with your variable names not being descriptive
<cjohnson>	and again, you're doing too many things on one line
<cjohnson>	too much to really wrap my head around
<kryo_>	the button is generated by this script https://dev.twitter.com/web/follow-button#using-javascript
<galtgendo>	ASAICT, I'm sending the very same arguments in both of these functions
<cjohnson>	break your code down into individual operations and build up the result over more than 3 lines, use better names, and we can look at how they differ
<theweirdn8>	dude, Splatoon is looking like game of the year!
<cjohnson>	well that would be a problem galtgendo becasue they have different argument lists
<cjohnson>	kryo_: sounds like a #css question?
<kryo_>	no cjohnson
<cjohnson>	"trying to add a style" is definitely CSS. But expand on what you're trying to do
<kryo_>	the script i'm using generates a button, but since the button isn't there when the page loads i'm having trouble adding the style
<galtgendo>	cjohnson: ...tutorial, please - short of types, that's valid C construct
<shwaiil>	hi
<cjohnson>	galtgendo: that doesn't change the points I made
<cjohnson>	kryo_: yeah, CSS doesn't care when the element is added
<cjohnson>	you can define the class on page load, and load the button after the fact
<shwaiil>	Q: ES6 is not available on modern browsers yet right ? Just wondering if I should go with babeljs to learn ES6 today, or if I can just stick with my favourite browser. Thanks
<cjohnson>	and it will still use those CSS rules if they apply to it
<cjohnson>	shwaiil: you can use es6-shim for the non-syntax features of ES6
<cjohnson>	otherwise yes you need babel
<shwaiil>	cjohnson: ok I'll use babel
<shwaiil>	Thanks for looking
<cjohnson>	np
<kryo_>	hmm thanks cjohnson
<kryo_>	i was trying to add the style directly to the element
<cjohnson>	well don't do that :) it's called "cascading" style sheets
<galtgendo>	cjohnson: these names don't need to be descriptive, those are all ints, it's kind of, but not quite, like alpha blending
<cjohnson>	galtgendo: *shrug*
<cjohnson>	obviously you're confused by your own code if you can't tell the diff between the two
<cjohnson>	so brekaing it down and using better var names would prob help that problem
<cjohnson>	kryo_: the button already comes with a class applied, twitter-follow-button
<cjohnson>	so you can just define .twitter-follow-button { /* your styles here */ } at the top of the page and it will apply even if the button is dynamically added
<mmmveggies>	in ES6 is { a: x => 'hello' || 'goodbye', ... } compiled to { a: (x => 'hello') || 'goodbye', ... } or { a: (x => 'hello' || 'goodbye'), ... } ?
<sckah>	hi there ... can somebody help me with canvas in html5 ?
<cjohnson>	!ask @ sckah
<ecmabot>	sckah: Don't ask to ask, nor if anyone is here or alive or uses something. Just ask your question. http://www.mikeash.com/getting_answers.html http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
<xqo>	if i want to change what value shows when i console.log(myObject), i change the toString() method of myObject?
<cjohnson>	yes xqo. or just do something like console.log(JSON.stringify(myObject)) if you're just trying to inspect it
<xqo>	thank you
<xqo>	cjohnson myObject.prototype.toString = ... ?
*	zz_robotmayo is now known as robotmayo
<cjohnson>	yeah or just myObject.toString if you don't want to modify the object's prototype (or it doesn't have one)
<jaawerth>	mmmveggies: the "function" part will consist of the first complete statement after the => so the binary operator will be part of the function
<sckah>	hi, I draw some line and circles in a canvas but some of these are not visible when the canvas has a particular w and h... somebody knows why?
<cjohnson>	mmmveggies: if you're interested, this tool seems handy: https://babeljs.io/repl/#?experimental=true&evaluate=true&loose=false&spec=false&code=%7B%20a%3A%20x%20%3D%3E%20'hello'%20%7C%7C%20'goodbye'%20%7D
<jaawerth>	b> let foo = x => x || 'newp'; console.log(foo('stuff')); console.log(foo(false)); 1 @mmmveggies
<mmmveggies>	jaawerth: wicked sweet, thanks. I have explicit parenthesis now, but the minimalist in me was upset
<babelbot>	mmmveggies: stuff newp 1
*	cjohnson divines sckah's code and output
<lalaland1125>	Sckah my guess would be that your lines are so thin they fall between two pixels. Make them wider
<jaawerth>	mmmveggies: the binary will still be part of the function if you use parentheses, since it's still a single statement
<kryo_>	yup i did something similar cjohnson, thanks again :)
<cjohnson>	np
<mmmveggies>	this bodes well
<sckah>	lalaland1125: nope... the lines have the same width of other arcs... that are visible
<galtgendo>	FFS, my point is why 'foo(a,b, c,d) {a = foo2(b,c,d)}; foo2(b,c,d) {return foo3}' and  'foo(a,b,c,d) {a = foo3;}' differ
<lalaland1125>	Sckah you need to provide code.
<sckah>	If I draw the arc and circles and then resize the window (whithout redrawing) always the same arc and circle disappear
<sckah>	ok
<sckah>	lalaland1125:
<sckah>	lalaland1125: ok give me a sec
<cjohnson>	galtgendo: and my point is we can't tell until we can actually figure out what your code is doing
<cjohnson>	ffs.
<cjohnson>	so make it suck less
<mmmveggies>	lol
<galtgendo>	cjohnson: it takes 2 ints, splits them it in four bytes each makes a weighted sum of each byte with the same index, then packs it back to an it - as I've said, somewhat like alpha blending
<galtgendo>	cjohnson: that's why 'c1===c2' should be safe - those should both be ints
*	oddskill_away is now known as oddskill
<cjohnson>	k
<cjohnson>	obviously you got it all figured out
<greves>	what is the logic for highlighting text in a string given: (1) a string and (2) a search term
<cjohnson>	"highlighting text" meaning what
<cjohnson>	a selection in a textarea? wrapping the text with a span that applies a class?
<greves>	wrap matches in the string with <span class="highlight">...</span>
<cjohnson>	.replace(target, '<span>$1</span>')
<greves>	well i'm using React so i dont want to dirtyset the innerHTML
<cjohnson>	then do it in the backend but either way the logic is the same
<cjohnson>	you can use this quick function snippet to turn a piece of text into an escaped regex: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3446170/escape-string-for-use-in-javascript-regex/6969486#6969486
<lalaland1125>	Greves use react.CreateElement
<cjohnson>	.replace(new RegExp('(' + escapeRegExp('your target stuff') + ')', 'g'), '<span>$1</span>')
<greves>	lalaland1125 you mean .replace(....., React.createElement('span', .....) )?
<lalaland1125>	No
<lalaland1125>	You do a search in render and get as output the locations of the text.
<galtgendo>	cjohnson: wait, do you mean, that to pass those arguments, I need to do something like 'foo(a, b, c) { foo2(arguments[1], arguments[2])}' ?
<lalaland1125>	Then you go to reach location
<lalaland1125>	And output the proceeding text as normal
<lalaland1125>	And the matched text inside a span
<greves>	lalaland1125 what do you mean output the locations of the text?
<cjohnson>	galtgendo: uh?
<LiENUS>	i just wanted to say
<LiENUS>	i hate javascripts object oriented programming
<LiENUS>	that is all
<cjohnson>	probably because you're trying to treat it like another language's paradigm
<cjohnson>	instead of understanding that prototypes != classes
<LiENUS>	its because it feels horribly hacked on
<LiENUS>	i get it
<LiENUS>	it just feels hacked on
<bradleymeck>	how?
<cjohnson>	right, you're trying to use prototypes as classes :P
<inimino>	galtgendo: they can't differ
<greves>	LiENUS: i was like you man but i'm a convert now
<LiENUS>	bradleymeck, private functions for one
<greves>	javascript is great once you start using it the way it was intended to be used (hint: not like a classical language)
<jaawerth>	they aren't meant for the heavy OOP paradigm
<bradleymeck>	LiENUS: closure functions are actually private and cannot be exposed via reflection
<cjohnson>	99% of the time, private functions are totally unnecessary. but if you must, there's always closures
<jaawerth>	treat it like a functional language with some OO features
<jaawerth>	because that's what it is
<greves>	LiENUS if you're having trouble with the private/public stuff you can try stampit, that lib makes it really stupidly easy to separate private and public logic
<lalaland1125>	Greves you  construct a children array for the component work
<LiENUS>	things like having to wrap your "class" in an IIFE just to get sensible private functions make it weird
<bradleymeck>	LiENUS: reflection is gonna beat the f out of you if you rely on access modifiers at compile time
<lalaland1125>	With alternating spans and plain text
<cjohnson>	LiENUS: why do you think you need private so much?
<bradleymeck>	LiENUS: thats how fun amounts of Java exploits work
<lalaland1125>	(Span for the highlighting)
<lalaland1125>	Bradleymeck, those are java plugin exploits. Not java exploits.
<cjohnson>	Almost always when I see people using private methods/data it's because that's what they're used to from java or whatever else, and so assume it's the "way things are"
<bradleymeck>	lalaland1125: if we are talking about the browser yes, but not all are done via plugin, sometimes the jar loader loads an unsigned jarfile and you can muck with things
<greves>	lalaland1125 so i have to do str.indexOf() and calculate the length of the matches every time or something?
<cjohnson>	you can use .exec in a while loop
<cjohnson>	to loop over regex matches
<lalaland1125>	Greves yep.
<lalaland1125>	It's a pain
<LiENUS>	bradleymeck, if someones able to get their own code running along side mine and use reflection on mine then i've already lost the XSS battle
<cjohnson>	sounds like a loooot of work to avoid a simple .replace
<lalaland1125>	Especially calculating the normal text right before the match.
<lalaland1125>	Cjohnson you gain xss protection though
<bradleymeck>	LiENUS: correct, but a lot of programmers don't know that private won't protect them
<cjohnson>	lalaland1125: I don't really see how?
<LiENUS>	a closure wont protect me from that, they've got the webpage equivalent of root access at that point
<bradleymeck>	LiENUS: you could propose a private method syntax to ecma if you really care. they are trying to find a good solution for it right now
<cjohnson>	if you have sensitive code/data, it shouldn't be running in the browser either way
<cjohnson>	using private methods to hide sensitive code is silly
<cjohnson>	put it on the server
<LiENUS>	i thought they have a new oop syntax already in the new proposal for ecmascript
<cjohnson>	they have a "class" keyword in ES6
<cjohnson>	but it's just syntactical sugar around prototypes
<cjohnson>	nothing new really
<swarm_te>	testing
<bradleymeck>	LiENUS: depends, if they are just a script that got in via XSS (closures are not accessible) or if they are a user with devtools (they actually can access closures)
<LiENUS>	bradleymeck, anything i could do in my closure they could just re implement in their xss
<bradleymeck>	LiENUS: no
<cjohnson>	same goes for "private" methods...
<cjohnson>	you're approaching this in an entirely roundabout way
<bradleymeck>	they cannot revive saved private data that has been gcd
*	jlongste` is now known as jlongster
<LiENUS>	sure they may not be able to get my code to twiddle the dom but they can twiddle the dom from their own
<Perseus0>	does anyone know how to insert a js file into let's say a textarea to be read as text?
<cjohnson>	all the more reason your backend should be verifying and sanitizing user inputs
<lalaland1125>	Cjohnson when you explicatly differentiate between HTML and text, like in react you gain xss orotection
<cjohnson>	Perseus0: load the js file via xhr, set the textarea's .innerHTML to it
<LiENUS>	cjohnson, yeah im pretty lazy my front end does almost no sanitization of user inputs its all done on the backend
<bradleymeck>	LiENUS: oop syntax doesn't make sense to me as a term. but there is a lot of work about around getting people not to see the word `prototype`
<cjohnson>	LiENUS: then why are you worried about it? all your sensitive code should already be on the backend so there's no need for "private" anything
<cjohnson>	and since you're already sanitizing all your inputs, who cares if somebody twiddles your dom
<LiENUS>	in fact currently what little sanitization appears to be done on the front end is actually just passed to the back end to be sanitized
<swarm_te>	Does anyone know where I would check the cross-browser usability of window.opener
<lalaland1125>	Actually, shoot cjhonson you are right
<lalaland1125>	I just thought about it some more
<lalaland1125>	Oh well
<bradleymeck>	LiENUS: if you make an ajax call and save the data with a nonce in a closure they cannot get your nonce to use
<galtgendo>	cjohnson: interesting, this seems to be the case - why aren't the parameters passed without that ? do I need to add a var for each arg to pass them ?
<bradleymeck>	LiENUS: the problem is that unlike most languages JS is expected to run in hostile environments so you need to have a data channel that can be defined at compile time, but not gain new access to at runtime. All the while exposing an interface for people to use
<cjohnson>	galtgendo: you definitely don't need to us arguments to access already-named params
<bradleymeck>	LiENUS: Symbols get us most of the way there, but none of the private symbol proposals passed those reqs so far
<cjohnson>	I gave you my advice: make your code more readable
<cjohnson>	until you do that, I dunno what to tell you
<cjohnson>	if you refuse ot make it more readable you're on your own :P
<lalaland1125>	JS only intends to protect the OS, not some js code from another.
<bradleymeck>	lalaland1125: yes and no, es-discuss goes to great depth on this in the private symbols conversations

<cresten>	Hey guys
<mmmveggies>	hey
<cresten>	so I have this code:
<cresten>	host = host.match(/tcp:\/\/(.*):[0-9]+/)[1];
<galtgendo>	that github code is pretty much it, I just wanted to see if the modified implementation from ffmpeg perform better
<poseidon>	Is there a way to do a post without it being ajax?
<cresten>	it's a js regex. But! there is not always a match, so this throws an error
<cresten>	What's the appropriate name for testing to see if the match is successful?
<mmmveggies>	uhh you mean regex.match(str) ?
<mmmveggies>	err, regex.test(str)
<inimino>	galtgendo: "pretty much it" isn't a test case!
<cresten>	mmmveggies: Yes, but what should I name that variable?
<Sharaal>	poseidon: <form> actions can be a post
<cresten>	isMatch?
<cjohnson>	cresten: don't put the [1] after it
<cjohnson>	return the match, check if it exists, and THEN read [1]
<cjohnson>	2 lines
<cresten>	cjohnson: yes, but what do I name the first variable?
<cjohnson>	hostMatches
<cjohnson>	or turtleSoup for all I care :P
<cresten>	cjohnson: +1
<cjohnson>	inimino: lol. enjoy that uphill battle
<inimino>	galtgendo: if you think that the arguments[1] or the foo3 examples you described are really happening, we'd be interested in seeing that, because the language actually doesn't work that way
<greves>	lalaland1125 so ugly :P http://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/

<inimino>	cjohnson: yeah, not gonna fight it ;)
<cresten>	solution: http://pastebin.com/vXruUbUd
<inimino>	cresten: I always go with "m"
<javascript778>	cresten: that's because y
<cresten>	I don't understand -_-
<inimino>	cresten: why are you doing the match twice???
<inimino>	cresten: var m=/foo/.exec(bar);
<cjohnson>	hostMatches ? hostMatches[1] : host
<inimino>	cresten: if(m) return m[1]
<javascript778>	inimino: your div isn't returned in your function ab
<inimino>	javascript778: you wanted someone else
<cjohnson>	I want you inimino
<cjohnson>	I waaaaant you to want me
<cjohnson>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJs_L7yq5qE
<inimino>	naturally
<cjohnson>	lol
<cresten>	I'm going with cjohnson inimino
<Perseus0>	thanks cjohnson
<swarm_te>	Does anyone know where I would check the cross-browser usability of window.opener
<cjohnson>	caniuse.com is a good place
<cjohnson>	if not, MDN
<inimino>	for new features
<swarm_te>	cjohnson: Ok thanks. I was already poking around MDN
<cjohnson>	I don't see a compat table for it
<cjohnson>	I usually assume when there's no compat table that it works everywhere
<cjohnson>	oh the text explains it
<cjohnson>	 If the current window has no opener, this method returns NULL.  Windows Phone browser does not support window.opener.  It is also not supported in IE if the opener is in a different security zone.
<swarm_te>	Right.
<swarm_te>	I just put in some code to test if the function exists before I call it
<mmmveggies>	what's a good workflow for getting everything under src/ babelfied and put in build/ in an identical organization? or am I going about this wrong
<swarm_te>	So hopefully it will gracefully fail when that function is not available
<inimino>	mmmveggies: browserify?
<mmmveggies>	i thought browserify was more interested in packing up src files into a big ol' build.js file
<Expel>	Is this line right? $('#container, #support-menu').css('min-height', winheight); or should it be like this: $('#container, #support-menu').css('min-height', winheight+'px');
<mmmveggies>	I just want to get all me .es6.js files to be .js, this is a strictly server-side app
<inimino>	mmmveggies: it is, it's just a good way of doing it
<inimino>	mmmveggies: ah
*	lanceball is now known as lance|afk
<mmmveggies>	is that something broccoli.js is used for? ive only just recently heard of its existence
<inimino>	mmmveggies: just for F in ...; do babel; done then?
<inimino>	seems like a trivial shell one-liner to me
<galtgendo>	inimino: http://filebin.ca/20v71quvYShs - my changes; the original site and code: http://phoboslab.org/files/js-hqx/test.html; switch between the two sets of _Interpolate_{2,3} functions (now, using the arguments trick, it's bit better, but still not quite right) (converting from c macros is a bit hard)
<mmmveggies>	i was thinking about doing that, wanted to omit .gitignore, not translate json, create directories if needed, etc so I was curious to see if there was an existing tool
*	CodeBot3000 is now known as riclima
<bradleymeck>	mmmveggies: babel outdir to that folder (and yes yes its duplicated work), cp with no-clobber

<zeroquake>	is there a way to have chrome console as a separate window form chrome dev source page?
<theweirdn8>	What do you guys think? https://twitter.com/Pawbyte/status/596342610060390402
<mmmveggies>	about game consoles? they're dumb
<AlphaAtom>	!falsy
<ecmabot>	AlphaAtom: The 'falsy' values in JavaScript are undefined, null, 0, -0, NaN, '', and false. The 'truthy' values are all other values. All objects are truthy. There is nothing both truthy and falsy, or neither truthy nor falsy.
<natmyers>	zeroquake: you can pop out the whole dev debugger but I don't think you can further pop out just the console
<zeroquake>	yah i wish we could further pop out console.
<natmyers>	zeroquake: generally I use repli.it if I want to test out javascript in a separate console
<natmyers>	sorry, repl.it
<natmyers>	that's a website, if it's not obvious
<zeroquake>	cool site, my need is mostly with the context of browser session.
<natmyers>	yeah it won't help you there
<zeroquake>	not sure if chrome remote debugging supports multiple channels...
<testerbit>	On line 16, why do enableFilterRecurring.call(this) instead of enableFilterRecurring(this)? http://pastebin.com/mKDHDye3

<xqo>	how can i delete a property from only one instance of an object? using "delete" also deletes the property from all other instances http://jsfiddle.net/uf522v3a/
<Iniglo>	xqo you can't because when you set object a = object b they are actually referring only to object a
<Iniglo>	object b holds object a and object a is the only real instance referred to
<Iniglo>	you'd have to create two identical objects instead
<xqo>	how do i make a new instance of an object?
<Iniglo>	You'd have to copy every property of it manually afaik
<Iniglo>	say that you have one object x, and another object y
<xqo>	must i do this? http://jsfiddle.net/uf522v3a/2/
<Iniglo>	that would work
<cjohnson>	Object.assign
<cjohnson>	!es6-shim @ xqo
<ecmabot>	xqo: Use https://www.npmjs.com/package/es6-shim to get every backwards-compatible feature of ES6 in every browser and node.js! It's heavily tested, comes with Promises, and requires the !es5-shim.
*	zz_robotmayo is now known as robotmayo
<ljharb>	!object.assign @ xqo
<ecmabot>	xqo: Using !es6 shim or https://www.npmjs.com/package/object.assign, you can do `Object.assign(target, source1, source2, sourceN)` for an elegant $.extend / _.extend replacement!
<Iniglo>	also take a look at this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/728360/most-elegant-way-to-clone-a-javascript-object
<cjohnson>	just use Object.assign, better to use the native methods than some third-party thingy
<xqo>	thank you.
<Iniglo>	If he can use es6 yes
<cjohnson>	altho I did have a question ljharb, is there an easy way to do deep cloning?
<Iniglo>	It's not always an option
<cjohnson>	Iniglo: everybody can use it. es6-shim which I just linked to
<cjohnson>	es6-shim is always an option
<jaawerth>	I think Object.assign is in ES5-shim but yeah
<cjohnson>	oh! better still
<Iniglo>	Oh it is?
<Iniglo>	then nvm :)
<jaawerth>	I could be wrong
<cjohnson>	ah no it's 6
<cjohnson>	well, it's an ES6 feature anyway
<jaawerth>	ah yeah, just checked
<jaawerth>	still, no reason not to use both
<cjohnson>	exactly
<jaawerth>	it makes a lot of other, larger libraries unnecessary
<cjohnson>	but anyway can you do deep clones with assign?
<jaawerth>	no
<Iniglo>	Yeah unless you're tied to a specific pipeline in a larger environment
<Iniglo>	but i doubt that's the case here
<jaawerth>	I mean, you'd have to write a function for it I believe
<cjohnson>	it's a browser shim Iniglo
<cjohnson>	no need to change your build step at all
<cjohnson>	yeah jaawerth that's what I figured
<Iniglo>	What do you guys think about this: function clone(obj) {
<Iniglo>	    if (null == obj || "object" != typeof obj) return obj;
<Iniglo>	    var copy = obj.constructor();
<Iniglo>	    for (var attr in obj) {
<Iniglo>	        if (obj.hasOwnProperty(attr)) copy[attr] = obj[attr];
<Iniglo>	    }
<ljharb>	cjohnson: not with Object.assign
<Iniglo>	    return copy;
<cjohnson>	I think pasting is evil
<Iniglo>	}
<cjohnson>	in the channel
<Iniglo>	sorry
<ljharb>	Iniglo: please NEVER paste code into irc.
<ljharb>	cjohnson: you can use `reduce` and `Object.assign` to deep clone.
<Iniglo>	Apologies
<cjohnson>	I think it's pointless when we already have Object.assign
<cjohnson>	ljharb: how would that look?
<ljharb>	cjohnson: but there’s no standard definition for “deep clone”, and usually needing to do that is a code smell.
<cjohnson>	yeah just curious
<cjohnson>	let's say we're talking totally flat object literals
<cjohnson>	er not flat. but no prototypes or circular references or anything like that
<cjohnson>	a mongodb record with sub-sub-sub objects or something
<Berra>	What does it mean when the JSdebugger (FF) references a variables like ua/B ?
<jaawerth>	Iniglo: the proper legacy compatible way to check if something is a plain object is function(obj) { return Object.prototype.toString.call(obj) === '[object Object]'
<jaawerth>	er, ;}
<cjohnson>	don't wink at me
<jaawerth>	haha
<cjohnson>	:P
<Iniglo>	Ok, thanks jaawerth
<cjohnson>	that works everywhere jaawerth? even in IE and such?
<ljharb>	!deepClone @ cjohnson
<cjohnson>	ljharb: it didn't do nuffin
<jaawerth>	cjohnson: generally speaking. to be thorough and rule out modified prototypes and things there are a few other things to check for, but at least that part should work everywhere. I defer to ljharb on this , though
<ljharb>	hm
<ljharb>	!snip deepclone @ cjohnson
<ecmabot>	|>function deepClone(o,i){i=Array.isArray(o)?[]:{};return Object.keys(o).reduce(function(a,k,x){return x=o[k],a[k]=typeof x=="object"?deepClone(x):x,a},i)}; @cjohnson
<jaawerth>	I mean, maybe not IE5
<jaawerth>	heh
<cjohnson>	IE7 is lowest version I care about
<cjohnson>	I was mostly just curious about the toString
<ecmabot>	ljharb: Your `|>` line input has been cleared. (1 minute)
<jaawerth>	cjohnson: you can do the same thing to polyfill isArray
<cjohnson>	interesting
<cjohnson>	why not instanceof Array ?
<ljharb>	if (!Array.isArray) { Array.isArray = function isArray(arr) { return Object.prototype.toString.call(arr) === ‘[object Array]’; } }
<ljharb>	because instanceof is awful
<jaawerth>	instanceof can lie
<cjohnson>	ok but why, where would it not work?
<ljharb>	it also won’t work if “Array” is redefined, or if the array comes from another iframe/realm.
<cjohnson>	only in a subclassed array right
<ljharb>	you can’t subclass arrays properly before ES6.
<cjohnson>	yeah I didn't figure
<jaawerth>	ljharb: don't tell me what to do!
<ljharb>	:-p
<cjohnson>	so assuming Array is still Array and that iframe business isn't about (that sounds crazy btw) it would work tho right?
<ljharb>	instanceof is just a huge troll.
<ljharb>	sure
<cjohnson>	I ask because I have used it
<cjohnson>	ok
<cjohnson>	what is that about the iframes tho
<ljharb>	but “sometimes horribly problematic” means, never use it :-)
<cjohnson>	its prototype is a different "Array" or something?
<ljharb>	cjohnson: each window object has a different Array constructor
<ljharb>	yes
<cjohnson>	interesting
<ljharb>	window.Array !== window2.Array
<ezakimak>	makes sense, kindof, because that ctor is a specialization of object
<ezakimak>	at least I can see how it could be a corner case
<jaawerth>	cjohnson: btw what ljharb wrote in here is exactly how es5-shim does it https://github.com/es-shims/es5-shim/blob/master/es5-shim.js#L57-L59
<cjohnson>	interesting
*	oddskill is now known as oddskill_away
<ljharb>	yep yep :-)
<ljharb>	that is the only isArray polyfill anyone ever uses or needs
<jaawerth>	cjohnson: you can use a similar approach to check for Maps and Sets
<ljharb>	not reliably
<jaawerth>	I was afraid you'd say that
<ljharb>	in ES6, there’s Symbol.toStringTag, so Object.prototype.toString.call is no longer safe.
<jaawerth>	new things always make it tricky
<ljharb>	you need to try/catch Map.prototype.has.call and Set.prototype.has.call
<jaawerth>	that makes sense
<ljharb>	(or, you can grab the .size getter for each and use that)
<jaawerth>	the prototype functions for Map and Set are super sensitive
<jaawerth>	I learned that during my trials and tribulations attempting to subclass them in babel, heh
<ljharb>	jaawerth: note https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-number-object and friends which handles toStringTag
<ezakimak>	will there be a wildcard proxy in es6?
<jaawerth>	ljharb: see this is why I defer to you on compatibility matters
<ljharb>	also https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-boolean-object https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-date-object https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-symbol https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-callable https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-regex https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-string
<dostoyevsky>	could I somehow force a document.body.scrollTop = 0 before an onfocus event on an textarea?
<ezakimak>	how would you do anything before any event?
<ezakimak>	you could do it onload
<dostoyevsky>	it alaways seems too late when I do it
<ezakimak>	you can't predict events, I'm saying
<jaawerth>	ljharb: so.. having not looked at Symbol.toStringTag, is the problem that the aforementioned symbol lets you override toString behavior even when using Object.prototype.toString.call?
<ljharb>	yep
<ljharb>	that’s its sole purpose
<jaawerth>	I thought it might be
<ljharb>	ie `var a = []; a[Symbol.toStringTag] = ‘Function’; Object.prototype.toString.call(a) === ‘[object Function]’` for example
<jaawerth>	Symbols are very much edging into function/operator overloading territory in some ways
<dostoyevsky>	ezakimak: I thought maybe there is another event I could capture before textarea.onfocus and then I could do preventdefault and then do a settimeout with the scrollTop = 0 and then pass on the onfocus event after that
<ljharb>	jaawerth: yeah sort of. well-known symbols are being used to move “internal/spec magic” into actual user-accessible behavior. which is in general a good thing.
<jaawerth>	yeah
<jaawerth>	having used it for this sort of thing, I very much love that you can use Symbol.iterator to make anything play nice with for...of
<ezakimak>	dostoyevsky, you're describing reacting to the event, why can't you do it in the handler?
<ezakimak>	ppl use for of?
<jaawerth>	Symbols really open up the ability for developers to define a protocol for compatibility
<jaawerth>	ezakimak: well, if you're using an ES6 transpiler, sure
<ezakimak>	i don't think i've even seen a for..of in code in 10 years
<jaawerth>	I... THINK it was added to TypeScript 1.5, too
<jaawerth>	for..of is new
<jaawerth>	you wouldn've have seen it in JS 10 years ago
<jaawerth>	wouldn't've*
<ezakimak>	ah, maybe i'm thinking of for..in
<dostoyevsky>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnvZDwgJRc <- because onfocus is too late to do body.document.scrollTop = 0 ...
<jaawerth>	yeah probably. for..in is the devil
<ezakimak>	so why bring it back merely renamed?
<jaawerth>	I can think of very few situations where you'd actually WANT to iterate over an entire prototype chain
<jaawerth>	ezakimak: behavior is totally different
<ezakimak>	oh, okay.
<jaawerth>	ezakimak: for..of is for working with anything that plays well with iterator protocol, it's very clean
<ezakimak>	i'm still amazed there isn't a built-in Object.prototype.forEach that enumerates only own keys
<ezakimak>	I always polyfill it
<aeschylus>	Is there a way to drag and drop urls/links with the html5 image api
<ezakimak>	clarify
<jaawerth>	b> var obj = {foo:1, bar:2, baz:3}; for (let key of Object.keys(obj) ) console.log(key, ":", obj[key]); ''; @ezakimak
<babelbot>	ezakimak: foo : 1 bar : 2 baz : 3
<ezakimak>	sure, es6
<ezakimak>	but that also first produces an array of the keys
<jaawerth>	hehe just showing you how for..of >> for..in
<ezakimak>	although it could produce a generator underneath
<jaawerth>	you can do it with a generator but the generator itself would still end up needing to either use object.keys or a for..in loop with isOwnPropertyOf
<jaawerth>	speaking of generators, that's the other thing about for..of
<jaawerth>	b> for (let val of (function*() { yield 'Moe'; yield 'Larry'; yield 'Curly'; })()) console.log(val); '';
<babelbot>	jaawerth: Moe Larry Curly
<ezakimak>	that's why i'm still baffled by the ommission of a native Object.prototype.forEach
<ezakimak>	oh, that is beautiful!
*	oddskill_away is now known as oddskill
<ezakimak>	ok, that is the first time I've actually seen a feature that got me interested in es6
<jaawerth>	hehe
<ezakimak>	i've known it had generators, but that of syntax paired with it is so nice
<jaawerth>	there are a LOT of very cool things you can do with iterators, and the coolest thing about generators is that they let you reduce ANYTHING to an iterator

<jaawerth>	once you've got it in iterator form, you can then do all sorts of things with lazy evaluation and non-mutating transformations

<Docmarten>	hola all...got a pestering css problem within my app.  the form i created should be displayed on one line:  Text <input> [Button] - but each item is one its own line making the form 80px high when it only needs to be 20px high.  Its driving me nuts:  http://pastebin.com/RmLbhUZg

<falafel>	Docmarten, try #css
<Docmarten>	hmmm...yeah, just doing so much scripting that I didn't notice where I pasted.
<falafel>	Docmarten, and when you go there get them a better paste, a fiddle, with a demo to reproduce
<Docmarten>	not certain it will replicate as its a phonegap app I am working on.

<javabear>	hello everybody
<average>	hi javabear
<average>	javabear: can you literally hello everybody though ?
<average>	javabear: there are 1308 people in this channel
<javabear>	I just did!
<natmyers>	you can if you are the lawnmower man
<javabear>	there is no need to be upset
<javabear>	I just completed codecademy's javascript class as a begineer, and now I'm working on coderbyte challenges
<javabear>	anybody care to help?
<alpha59>	does anyone work with audio recording in the browser?
<Guest28>	Does anybody have any good resources for learning about callbacks?
<alpha59>	javabear: what's the challenge?
<falafel>	!cps @ Guest28
<ecmabot>	Guest28: Continuation-Passing style is the formal term for the "callback-based" approach to programming. CPS is a heavily used idiom in JavaScript to deal with asynchronous programming. See http://matt.might.net/articles/by-example-continuation-passing-style/
<javabear>	alpha59: reverse the characters in a string
<average>	falafel: yo
<Guest28>	thanks! I can't seem to wrap my head around this.
<average>	falafel: does ecmabot have an RSS somewhere, or some twitter account  I could follow ?
<falafel>	average, maybe
<falafel>	average, see https://github.com/oftn/oftn-bot
<falafel>	maybe you find something there
<javabear>	alpha59: I'm thinking maybe I need a for loop, maybe a for in loop. Maybe I need a temporary variable while I concatate one character to it at a time, then change the global string input to that temporary variable.
<alpha59>	javabrear: something liske this--> str.split("").reverse().join("");
<natmyers>	haha, isn't the point of coding challenges to figure out the solution?
<javabear>	oh, interesting
<alpha59>	or you can loop through the string and do something like--> var js = "javascript"; js[js.length-1]; js[js.length-2]; ect...
<natmyers>	reverse() is the most straight forward solution, but I think the exercise is probably wanting you to get in some practice with loops
<falafel>	or recursion
<alpha59>	in a loop that runs while i<length
<diamonds>	Guest28: in a nutshell, when calling a function like "readFile" that takes a while (say 100ms) & you want to do something with the RESULT of that function, you pass that function another function that it will run when the long-running-operation completes (i.e. the file is read)
<alpha59>	i wouldnt use recursion here, a loop would be a heck of a lot easier. If you were trying to reverse a queue or a stack then recursion makes more sense- but a string is just an array.
<falafel>	Guest28, no callback: `log(foo('baz'))`, with callback: `foo('baz', log)`. That's CPS
<diamonds>	readFile('file.txt', function thisRunsWhenFileIsFullyRead(file_contents){ /*do something with file contents*/ });
<alpha59>	you could still do it recursively with just peeling off the last character and doing the call on a substring
<falafel>	Guest28, functions are passed as arguments
<Guest28>	<diamonds>Thanks, I think that is what I am running into.  I am working with ajax and I am having issues getting the results out of the anon functiion that I am working with.
<diamonds>	alpha59: out of curiosity how would you do it with recursion? (I'm not gr8 with recursion)
<falafel>	Guest28, you can't. Once you go async, there is no way back
<diamonds>	I like to see good/simple examples when I can :)
<falafel>	or no way out
<falafel>	you are trapped in async world
<diamonds>	!bin @ Guest28
<Guest28>	I am doomed.
<diamonds>	!fiddle @ Guest28

<Jumbotron>	why is a good practice to test in Incognito mode?
<diamonds>	sorry I keep forgetting
<diamonds>	when did the bot get put under lock'n'key?
<natmyers>	Jumbotron: incognito mode disables all extensions and clears cache and cookies
<falafel>	Jumbotron, because it is like you are testing the site always like a new user
<Jumbotron>	natmyers: thanks
<Jumbotron>	falafel: thanks
<alpha59>	function reverse(str){ if(str.length > 1){ return substr(string.length-1) + reverse(substr(0, string.length-1))}else{ return str;}}
<Guest28>	http://jsfiddle.net/z0rfv78w/
<Guest28>	IDK if that is helpful.
<alpha59>	or something like that. THe statements/length operators may be out of order- but thats the basic idea.
<alpha59>	recursion is easy- you are checking to see if the problem is done, and then solving as little of it as possible, and then telling yourself to solve the rest of it.
<natmyers>	I find some people find recursion dead easy and for other people it'll break your brain
<xreal>	A bit offtopic, but maybe anyone can help: I want to search for known content in an known js variable in firefox. Is this possible with their developer tools?
<natmyers>	I know it took me a long time to really get recursion

<babelbot>	falafel: olleh
<falafel>	es6 is nice
<falafel>	for golfing
<alpha59>	falagfel: that's just esoteric.
<falafel>	only thing I'd do differently is checking the length, but that's how I'd do it with recursion
<alpha59>	I like the answer, I just wouldn't use that in production code. or anywhere that wasn't golfing.
<alpha59>	but I
<diamonds>	yah
*	diamonds learned from both
<alpha59>	but I've ever done code golf in python.
<diamonds>	I really hope people don't go nuts with the fat arrow functions...
<alpha59>	only ever*
<falafel>	I would use this in production http://dpaste.com/2Q12YH3
<falafel>	I wouldn't use substring
<diamonds>	are there any "style recommendations" about when you should use a full function declaration (w/wrapping {} explicit return etc.)?
<falafel>	and '' is identity, so it good, it is expected
<falafel>	same as you'd return zero with numbers, you'd return '' with strings
<diamonds>	cuz if ppl try to see how many lambdas they can cram into 80 columns just for shits and giggles that will be very annoying
<falafel>	sry, meant this http://dpaste.com/02AED4Y
<falafel>	forgot the .slice lol
<alpha59>	http://dpaste.com/0W6G0GE just sooo much cleaner looking (but to each his own- style is style).
<diamonds>	with the {} falafels solution is plenty readable to me
<alpha59>	yeah, you're right about the '', that's my bad.
<diamonds>	no hoist tho correct? http://dpaste.com/02AED4Y
<falafel>	diamonds, right
<alpha59>	It's readable and makes sense, and they do exactly the same thing (I believe? am I wrong that the difference in declaration makes no difference?)
<falafel>	it does
*	oddskill is now known as oddskill_away
<falafel>	!fd vs fe
<falafel>	!fe vs fd
<ecmabot>	falafel: A function declaration `function declared() {}` & a function expression e.g. `var bar = function expressed() {}`: the former is !hoisted, the latter can be immediately invoked (see !iife) and can be anonymous (eg can omit the name "expressed"). "function" as the first word of a statement at global scope or directly inside a function starts a function declaration; otherwise, it starts a function expression.
<falafel>	plus in ES6 with short arrow you get `this` bounded, which for this case is irrelevant
<diamonds>	man I need to learn more es6 :/
<alpha59>	can't I immediately invoke a non-hoisted by wrapping it in (function(param){})(param)
<falafel>	alpha59, but that's no longer a function declaration then, it is a function expression
<falafel>	the parentheses force an expression, that's why it works
<ezakimak>	and you can also name it
<falafel>	(function frame(){raf(frame)}())
<falafel>	a "game loop"
<alpha59>	what about the => operator you were using
<falafel>	dog balls
<falafel>	alpha59, that is short arrow, `a => b === function(a){return b}.bind(this)`
<falafel>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGArABpLy0k
<diamonds>	.bind(this)?
<ezakimak>	is there a version that doesn't implicitly bind?
<diamonds>	that's built in? huh
<antons>	guys looking for backbone.js people to work on the project
<antons>	please contact me
<ezakimak>	what project? backbone itself?
<falafel>	diamonds, yah, it binds the value of `this` forever, and partially applies arguments
<antons>	backbone front - flask or rails backend
<theviajerock>	Good Afternoon Folks...
<antons>	or itself
<antons>	whichever easier
<ezakimak>	pm?
<antons>	yea
<theviajerock>	I have a silly question.... I am beginner... and i am looking somebody code...
<theviajerock>	what the hell do this ?
<theviajerock>	var root = tree = (tree || {});
<alpha59>	although this is actually facinating- And I will look more into it later, my original reason for logging on was to ask about audio recording in the browser and then saving as a wav file on a server
<theviajerock>	i underestand when assign a variable
<theviajerock>	but... that second =
<theviajerock>	i do not underestand that.
<falafel>	theviajerock, tree = tree ? tree : []
<falafel>	does that make more sense?
<diamonds>	tree = tree || {}
<diamonds>	plus "assign the same value to root"
<theviajerock>	Yess
<falafel>	oh, it was {}., my bad
<diamonds>	falafel: what do you mean partially applies, is there a simple example that illustrates this?
<diamonds>	I know what partial application is generally
<ezakimak>	curry
<falafel>	b>var add=(x, y) => x + y; var add1 = add.bind(null, 1); add1(2) @ diamonds
<babelbot>	diamonds: 3
<ezakimak>	http://hughfdjackson.com/javascript/why-curry-helps/
<theviajerock>	Thanks for the help guys
<falafel>	curry uses partial application
<falafel>	or rather, the curry helpers
<diamonds>	ty ezakimak i've been reading a ton of these lately
<diamonds>	trying to choke down the FP coolaid :)
<falafel>	you can use Function#bind to build `curry`
<diamonds>	I'm getting there
<ezakimak>	ever study 3-d matrix programming techniques?
<ezakimak>	they didn't call it currying, but that's essentially what they do
<diamonds>	omg.... never thought of using bind to partially apply ?!
<diamonds>	not sure why this didn't occur to me, it's right in the api docs
<ezakimak>	i use bind to partially apply all the time
<ezakimak>	another: http://buzzdecafe.github.io/code/2014/05/16/introducing-ramda/

*	Guest20986 is now known as Torkable
<diamonds>	so jaawerth if you HAD to pick, FP or angular...?
<diamonds>	I know I know it's like choosing a favorite child
<jaawerth>	haha well
<diamonds>	;)
<jaawerth>	Angular 1.x is tougher to use both in, but not impossible, and Angular 2.0 (while relying too much on classes in its DI by default) is MUCH more FP-friendly
<jaawerth>	I know you said "if I HAD to pick"
<_rgn>	jaawerth: i agree, writing code with livescript, ramda and data.maybe is a lot of fun, Promise API is kind of clunky to compose but it's nice. should look at data.task/futures
<jaawerth>	so I'd probably go with FP
<jaawerth>	I like Angular a lot, but a huge part of that is that it was my entry into the greater world of proper client-side programming beyond jquery spaghetti
<antons>	is node.js has similar to javascript syntax
<Torkable>	lol
<jaawerth>	antons: uh, node is the v8 javascript engine, so... yes
<jaawerth>	antons: by which I mean: it's javascript
<antons>	so its essentially same back-end/front end ?
<ljharb>	so no, it’s not similar. it’s exactly the same.
<Torkable>	yup yup yup
<antons>	fuking hell
<antons>	its merging :)
<antons>	soon there wont be front/end developer
<antons>	how long to learn javascript ?
<ljharb>	browsers and servers are still different.
<KonKalid>	I disagree
<ljharb>	antons: that depends on you
<KonKalid>	there always be front end developers
<ljharb>	KonKalid: with which part

<ljharb>	right

<hetii>	How do you think, what will be the best chunk file size to transfer over network ?:)
<ezakimak>	just let tcp figure it out for you
<ezakimak>	but the question is vague--"best" for what conditions? throughput? latency? minimal fragments? minimal retries?
<ezakimak>	and how does your Q relate to js?
<hetii>	well I prepare a asynchoronize file uploader that will use authobahn: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/mJVbBr?editors=011
<hetii>	and wonder how big chunk of slice to use when will upload a files that have few KB as well as fewGB
<ezakimak>	ok, so you have no real control--just give it everything you have and let the underlying take care of it
<ezakimak>	why complicate things and make more work for youself?
<hetii>	first of all if I will send few GB I cannot simply use POST request or even alocate such amount of data in browser memmory
<hetii>	thas why I need to read such huge file step by step and send this chunk over network
<hetii>	also I plan to control somehow checksum to be sure that the file is transfered right at the end
<hetii>	and in the case if not then send just corrupted chunk
<ezakimak>	how are you going to read only part of the file in?
<hetii>	by file.slice()
<hetii>	http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/#toc-slicing-files
<ezakimak>	ah, i didn't know slice would work on the file object before loading it all
<hetii>	yep, thats the nice think :)
<ezakimak>	well, what's your web server's max upload size set to?
<ezakimak>	there's one limit to start from
<ezakimak>	I don't think you need to add additional checksumming though--tcp does all that for you

<falafel>	isn't there some new API for that?
<j201>	although it's just as incorrect
<ezakimak>	sounds like a name out of Asterix comic
<j201>	since it means requests that are async and XML, neither of which AJAX has to be
<falafel>	I'd prefer `style({borderRight}, elem)`
<ezakimak>	well, rpc() is probably more accurate

<adavia>	can i use a variable as an object property something like var foo = 'bar' and then obj.data.foo ?
<m_zr0>	i read that as 'wake up the neighbors screaming at me', and it produced some really funny imagery of horrible neighbors painting the walls with curses in their sleep while he hacks away next door
<robertmaxrees>	adam12 obj.data[foo]
<robertmaxrees>	err, adavia my bad.
<ljharb>	!bracket @ adavia
<ecmabot>	adavia: yourObject.foobar is just another way of saying yourObject['foobar']. So of course if varName = 'foobar', then it's also the same as yourObject[varName]. Dot notation is preferred to bracket notation except where the property name would be an invalid identifier. The same applies to quoting keys inside object literals - don't do it unless you have to.
<adavia>	so basically i can do obj.data[foo]
<adavia>	dot know why i get undefined
<adavia>	ohh i needed quotes
<foodeater>	any reason to use PHP anyway?
<ljharb>	adavia: if it’s “foo” in quotes, it’s the string foo, not the variable foo

<RonRichie>	hey ljharb, I was looking for you! :)
<RonRichie>	Ive a little question about callbacks, it's a little confusing for me, I'm trying to understand
<foodeater>	blizzy, so what is it support on webhostings? anything else?
<ljharb>	!ask @ RonRichie
<ecmabot>	RonRichie: Don't ask to ask, nor if anyone is here or alive or uses something. Just ask your question. http://www.mikeash.com/getting_answers.html http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
<RonRichie>	in a code block when interpreter reads the code and counters to callback function, does interpreter waits for other statements in function to return before firing the callback or callback gets fired as soon as interpreter hits that line?
<xaxxon>	callbacks don't get called when the interpreter sees the line - that's the definition of a callback
<ljharb>	RonRichie: nothing in JS ever “waits"
<xaxxon>	ljharb, it doesn't wait, but the function isn't called then, either, since it's not requested to be called
<ljharb>	RonRichie: but async means that the callback will be invoked many ms after all the code in the calling function is done
<ljharb>	right
<falafel>	!event loop
<ecmabot>	falafel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ Philip Roberts: What the heck is the event loop anyway? | JSConf EU 2014
<falafel>	RonRichie, ^^
<xaxxon>	ljharb, is the order of execution of parameters to a function defined in javascript?
<RonRichie>	let me look it up:)
<ljharb>	xaxxon: what do you mean execution of parameters?
<falafel>	what does that mean?
<xaxxon>	foo(bar(), baz()) - what order is bar and baz called
<deltab>	RonRichie: you generally have callbacks *because* they can't be executed immediately
<falafel>	xaxxon, same order as `bar(); baz()`
<RonRichie>	deltab so that means callbacks are executed once previous statments in that code block have already been executed?
<xaxxon>	falafel, ok.  I know in some languages it's undefined
<falafel>	>>var bar=function(){}; bar(console.log(1), console.log(2))
<ecmabot>	falafel: undefined; Console: 1, 2
<xaxxon>	falafel, but that doesn't mean that the order is defined
<deltab>	RonRichie: if they're async, after the rest
<falafel>	what do you mean? JS is strict, and expressions happen in the order you execute them
<xaxxon>	but I believe you
<Agamemnus>	shit
<RonRichie>	deltab what is the async though?
<falafel>	xaxxon, why would the order matthe anyway? If you are composing functions, you usually don't care that much about the order of execution, but more about properties like associativity, commutativity, etc
<falafel>	&matter
<xaxxon>	falafel, it was just a question
<ljharb>	xaxxon: left to right
<ljharb>	xaxxon: it’s defined.

<xaxxon>	when should I expect to be able to use most javascript 6 features in modern browsers?  I was sad a bunch of array methods don't work in chrome yet
<falafel>	xaxxon, polyfill it
<j201>	xaxxon: es6-shim, babel
<xaxxon>	neat
<deltab>	RonRichie: some callbacks are used to plug some behaviour into an algorithm: for instance arr.map(function (x) { return x.y; })
<deltab>	RonRichie: those are synchronous: they're called immediately
<leptone>	how can i center the images in carousel? https://jsfiddle.net/wx9meay3/2/
<falafel>	they could be synchronous or asynchronous, the callback doesn't necessarily tell you about that
<deltab>	right
<xaxxon>	which browser do you guys prefer to do initial development/debugging in?
<RonRichie>	I see... I'm having really bad time understanding and getting hang of these callback functions properly, whatever source I find to learn either it doesnt explain clearly or it's confusing(like eloquent's JS), does anybody know any good resource that explains callbacks throughly but in plain English?
<deltab>	RonRichie: but a big use for callbacks is to delay action until something external happens
<xaxxon>	RonRichie, I'll PM you if you want
<falafel>	RonRichie, maybe read up on the math side of it, untyped lambda calculus
<falafel>	to understand why callbacks are useful
<Agamemnus>	oh boy
<RonRichie>	xaxxon sure I'd want to :)
<Agamemnus>	lambda ... lamb
<xaxxon>	I'm guessing that's not the starting point
<Agamemnus>	sheep
<falafel>	lol
<falafel>	I spell it wrong
<Havvy>	I doubt the untyped lambda calculus will make somebody understand callbacks better.
<deltab>	RonRichie: for instance you want to make something happen only when a button is pressed
<Agamemnus>	you spelled it right
<falafel>	or did I? lamda, lambda?
<falafel>	mmm
<Agamemnus>	but it seems a little complex
<Havvy>	It's "lambda"
<falafel>	ah, I spelled it right then, λ
<falafel>	Havvy, so formal theory is not useful? I think it is
<zomg>	Useful if you're some kind of crazy math nerd

<zomg>	I mean maybe it has its uses... but this is again one of these cases where you have a hammer and everything looks like nails... and the assumption that everyone else has graduated from hammer 101
<falafel>	It is the generality of lambda that makes it useful, "callback" is a very narrow term
<zomg>	=)

<Agamemnus>	a border?
<deltab>	ooh, looking nicer
<deltab>	needs to scale to fit the viewport though
<Sorella>	RonRichie: a function is a way of parameterising expressions. If you have `2 * 2`, but you want to talk about any number multiplied by 2, you'd need to make part of that expression a little bit more generic. Functions allow you to do that, so `var f = function(x){ return x * 2 }`. To use that expression, you now need to provide a value for its parameters (in
<Sorella>	this case `x`), so `f(2)` is the same as `2 * 2`. You can easily reason about it by just replacing the `f(2)` by the body of that function, so: `f(2) => function(x){ return x * 2 }(2) => function(2){ return 2 * 2 } => return 2 * 2 => 4`.
<deltab>	Agamemnus: also letter x should be a multiplication sign, ×
<RonRichie>	Sorella aha makes sense, that was a very nicely layed out explanation though:) thanks a lot for that
<Sorella>	RonRichie: Since you're just replacing expressions, it follows that you can pass functions around, so if you have: `var apply = function(f, x){ return f(x) }; inc = function(a){ return a + 1 }`, and you have the expression `apply(inc, 2)`, you can use the same kind of reasoning. Just replace things (which you should be very familiar with from solving
<Sorella>	equations in high school), so: `apply(inc, 2) => function(f, x){ return f(x) }(inc, 2) => function(inc, 2){ return inc(2) } => inc(2) => function(a){ return a + 1 }(2) => function(2){ return 2 + 1 } => 2 + 1 => 3`.
<RonRichie>	Sorella niceee, makes more sense:) hell! that has to be one of the most thorough and detailed explanations I've ever seen on anything, thanks very very much again, I'll read  that now a few times over to understand it better:)
<Sorella>	RonRichie: A callback is just a function you provide to a function that doesn't *return* (it doesn't use `return` to provide a value). That function will eventually be invoked with some value so the computation may continue. It's easy to move from functions returning values to functions not returning a value if you imagine that the special construct "return"
<Sorella>	doesn't exist, but you can "simulate" that by passing functions around. So: `function add(a, b){ return a + b }` in a callback form would be `function add(a, b, Return){ Return(a + b) }`. With the difference that you're now explicitly providing *where* it will "return" to.
<Sorella>	!cps @ RonRichie
<ecmabot>	RonRichie: Continuation-Passing style is the formal term for the "callback-based" approach to programming. CPS is a heavily used idiom in JavaScript to deal with asynchronous programming. See http://matt.might.net/articles/by-example-continuation-passing-style/
<Sorella>	I should probably make a blog post about this...
<falafel>	equational reasoning?
<RonRichie>	Sorella I think you definetely should, would help a lot of people, you explain things quite well and detailed
<Sorella>	falafel: yup :) I've noticed that people have an easier time understanding functions if you tell them they can just substitute values. I suppose the people behind SICP and HtDP noticed that before though :P
<Havvy>	!htdp
<ecmabot>	Havvy: http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/
<falafel>	I think Haskell is particularly good for learning equational reasoning, because all the sugar is functions, in JavaScript syntax gets in the way. I'd say Clojure is good too
<Nikesh>	is using `return console.log(error)` a decent way to handle errors?
<falafel>	Nikesh, well, console.log returns undefined, not sure what you mean...
<Nikesh>	falafel: Sorry, I still get confused with when to use 'return', I just mean that I want the program flow to stop and to return the error
<Nikesh>	console.log(error) from within a callback

<bluezone>	This language is much more complex than i imagined it to be
<greves>	are there any channels for user interface design?
<cjohnson>	#css #web maybe?
<cjohnson>	bluezone: english?
<cjohnson>	;P
<bluezone>	What do you mean?
<bluezone>	oh
<bluezone>	haha
<cjohnson>	dumb joke :P
<bluezone>	yeah I find this nested function business confusing at times, and the weird use of || in recursion
<cjohnson>	|| in recursion? what do you mean by that
<bluezone>	cjohnson, http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html#p_ca4W5yMbty
<bluezone>	using || without using booleans as far as i can tell
<cjohnson>	oh, that's nothing to do with recursion really. it's just that the || operator returns the value of the operand that is truthy
<cjohnson>	>> 'a' || 'b'
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: (string) 'a'
<cjohnson>	>> false || 'b'
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: (string) 'b'
<bluezone>	oh
<cjohnson>	so if ('a' || 'b') is really just if ('a'), and 'a' is truthy
<cjohnson>	!truthy
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: The 'falsy' values in JavaScript are undefined, null, 0, -0, NaN, '', and false. The 'truthy' values are all other values. All objects are truthy. There is nothing both truthy and falsy, or neither truthy nor falsy.
<bluezone>	yeah some things are the same as false i remember now
<cjohnson>	exactly these 8 values are falsy, everything else is truthy
<bluezone>	still I find it odd :(
<cjohnson>	yeah it's a bit confusing at times. but it makes for succinct code
<cjohnson>	>> var data = {}; var title = data.title || 'default value'; title
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: (string) 'default value'
<cjohnson>	>> var data = {title: 'overridden title'}; var title = data.title || 'default value'; title
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: (string) 'overridden title'
<cjohnson>	good for "defaults"
<cjohnson>	in your example, if they didn't use ||, it would have had to be like 3 lines longer
<bluezone>	eh
<bluezone>	not necessarily but in this language yeah haha
<cjohnson>	var r = find(...); if (r) { return r; } else { return find(2...); }
<cjohnson>	otherwise you would have to store the value of the first function first, so you can check it
<cjohnson>	then check, and if it's truthy, return it, and if not, perform the second function and return that
<bluezone>	can you write classes at all?
<cjohnson>	not in the way you're used to. it's all prototypes in JS
<cjohnson>	eloquent gets into that
<bluezone>	mkay
<bluezone>	this is getting almost more odd than python
<cjohnson>	it's pretty powerful when you get the hang of it
<cjohnson>	it's definitely more functional than OOP
<cjohnson>	if you're from c/java it will seem odd at first. but many people find it very powerful, and in some cases even more so than their classical oop counterparts
<cjohnson>	more functional than classical* I meant
*	WrksOnMyMachine is now known as Guest78387
<bluezone>	the thing is, I feel it can also lead to mediocre code pretty easily
<bluezone>	or at least code that's much harder to read/understand
<cjohnson>	that's more a function of the developer than the language
<cjohnson>	I've seen plenty of incredibly hard to read/understand classical oop in java
<bluezone>	yeah
<ezakimak>	closures alone make it extremely powerful
<ezakimak>	which afaik neither C++ nor Java really have yet
<bluezone>	i think they do but
<ezakimak>	c++ has lambdas in the form of template meta programming
<bluezone>	it works for objects in java rather than functions in javascript
<ezakimak>	and java may also now have lambda syntax
<ezakimak>	but i don't think they really have closures, that requires a different model of managing variable scoping than they have--both stack-based
<bluezone>	doesn't closure just mean that one function var will have it's own copy of the internal variables when another function var is also being used?
<bluezone>	that's what i read in eloquent anyway
<forQuery>	i always thought of closure as functions inside functions, with their respective scopes.  But, im sure that's an incorrect or over sipmlified definition.
<Agro>	closure is just when variable in scope of a lambda r in scope of the lambda
<j201>	well, i like the simple intuitive understanding that it would be weird for them to work otherwise
<j201>	with lexical scoping and first class functions
<Havvy>	forQuery:  Nope. That's just about it.
<j201>	i mean, i know it has more to do with functions carrying around scopes on an implementation level, but i don't think it's a difficult concept to understand unless you're too used to the limitations of languages like java
<Havvy>	"A closure is when an inner function has access to the environmental record of an outer function, even after the outer function has finished executing."
<Havvy>	j201:  Java has closures w.r.t to anonymous inner classes.
<bluezone>	exactly
<Havvy>	Though it's only over `final` variables.
<electriv>	If anyone's been playing around with React Native lately and currently in Aus, feel free to shoot me a PM. Working on a little side project atm
<ezakimak>	closures mean that any variable referenced by the scope of the closure must persist even after the lexical scope in which that variable was created is gone (because it's function completes)
<javascript410>	newbie question but if I use datatables (www.datatables.net) does that mean normally i would use jquery.get/post to update my database?   Totally confused.
<ezakimak>	it generally requires that the symbol table be an active feature, rather than baked in to the executable's structure
<ezakimak>	jquery is so bloated. you can use whatever you want I'm sure
<javascript410>	ezakimak thanks.  I am a newbie.  I dont mind bloatness if it is simple.  What would be the simplest way do you think?
<ezakimak>	don't they have examples?
<cjohnson>	it says "DataTables Table plug-in for jQuery
<cjohnson>	so I imagine you need jquery
<ezakimak>	i thought dt was independent
<cjohnson>	as to your question, reading further down the page, it says "Supports almost any data source:
<ezakimak>	if not, then jquery is your solution
<cjohnson>	DOM, Javascript, Ajax and server-side processing"
<cjohnson>	I would recommend reading the docs if you want more info
<j201>	javascript410: jquery plugins will generally work for a certain range of use cases, and usually fail miserably when you want to move beyond them, or tweak the results, or change your stack, or use a real module system, and so on
<j201>	so use them if they're the best solution, but be aware of the limitations
<javascript410>	j201 thank you.  that makes sense.
<cjohnson>	it seems like the datatable is more about being the view to your data. you would prob want/need to use something else to actually update your data
<javascript410>	cjohnson ok but i could use jquery.ajax right?  That would not be a strange way of doing it right?
<ezakimak>	jquery.ajax is mostly self-contained
<cjohnson>	using jquery.ajax is a normal way of making ajax requests to a backend yeah
<cjohnson>	obviously you would need to create the backend that takes these requests and transforms your DB based on them
<ezakimak>	it does unfortunately use jquery promises (which are broken), but it's still usable and easy
<cjohnson>	they work just fine, they're not broken. and they're not promises, they're deferreds, which may be why you think they are broken, your confusion about what they actually are ;)
<cjohnson>	work pretty much the same way, but the API differs
<cjohnson>	and not 1:1
<ezakimak>	they have been called promises for a long time by many people
<ezakimak>	and the api overlaps the various promise apis
<cjohnson>	people who are wrong
<ezakimak>	which can make things very confusing
<cjohnson>	the docs call them deferreds
<cjohnson>	the API was updated to make them easily fit in with other promises (which only dictates that something must be "thenable" to interoperate)
<ezakimak>	from the jquery.ajax docs: "The jqXHR objects returned by $.ajax() as of jQuery 1.5 implement the Promise interface"
<cjohnson>	right, that's the update I just mentioned
<ezakimak>	and "$.Deferred" is deprecated
<cjohnson>	it *implements* the promise interface, but it's still called a deferred
<cjohnson>	https://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
<ezakimak>	sure, some promises dictate only that
<ezakimak>	but most promises specs require more behavior than that
<ezakimak>	promises/a+ especially
<cjohnson>	it doesn't follow Promises/A+
<cjohnson>	it merely follows "promises"
<cjohnson>	again, you're conflating things
<cjohnson>	in either case. it works just fine
<ljharb>	how is $.Deferred deprecated
<ezakimak>	well, since es6 is adopting promises/a+, in the context *here*, "promises" usualyl means promises/a+
*	cjohnson sighs
<ezakimak>	ljharb, that's a cut and paste from their docs
<ljharb>	where?
<ezakimak>	i'm aware there have been several different specs for promises in the past
<ljharb>	that link only shows certain methods as deprecated.
<cjohnson>	there still are several specs
<ezakimak>	in the jquery.ajax page
<cjohnson>	https://api.jquery.com/jquery.deferred/
<ljharb>	at this point, the only spec that matters for promises is the ES6 spec.
<ljharb>	right, cjohnson's link only describes 3 methods as deprecated.
<ljharb>	the rest is just fine, and not deprecated whatsoever.
<ezakimak>	$.Deferred isn't deprecated.
<ezakimak>	i misquoted
<ezakimak>	that would make no sense.
<ljharb>	indeed.
<ljharb>	at any rate, the only spec that matters for Promises is now ES6, which is based on Promises/A+
<ezakimak>	isn't the es6 spec using promises/a+?
<cjohnson>	in either case, do you have any examples where a deferred wouldn't work with a Promises/A+ promise?
<ljharb>	i think jQuery's ".then" method does indeed conform, but i'm not certain.
<ljharb>	no, jquery deferreds are "thenable", so they work fin
<ljharb>	*e
<ezakimak>	there's a widely quoted blog post about the deficiencies of deferreds vs promises/a+
<cjohnson>	that's what I thought
<ezakimak>	lemme find it.
<cjohnson>	you said "they are broken"
<ljharb>	i can list them, there's not many
<ezakimak>	actually, I think it may be in the q docs
<ljharb>	a) jquery deferreds can resolve sync
<ljharb>	b) jquery deferreds don't swallow exceptions
<ezakimak>	they don't handle error propogation
<ljharb>	that's it.
<cjohnson>	ohhhhh that's where I got the idea that promises can resolve sync
<cjohnson>	good to know
<ezakimak>	iirc in the q docs they list 4 criteria, and $.Deferred only hit 1
<ljharb>	right, it's just jquery that resolves sync.
<ljharb>	https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/Coming-from-jQuery lists just those two.
<ljharb>	if you only use .then, then it's only those 2.
<ezakimak>	https://blog.domenic.me/youre-missing-the-point-of-promises/
<ezakimak>	that's the one
<cjohnson>	do bluebird and Q and all the other majors follow Promises/A+ now?
<ljharb>	ezakimak: so that says "before 1.8" for one
<ljharb>	cjohnson: yes iirc, but now that doesn't matter. it only matters if they comply with es6.
<ezakimak>	it's the 1-4 list 2/3 down
<cjohnson>	well through the transitive property doesn't that mean basically the same thing?
<cjohnson>	es6 is promises/a+ and they are promises/a+ so they comply with es6?
<cjohnson>	or does es6 differ
<ezakimak>	The last para under "So What?" heading sums it up
<cjohnson>	As authors of Promises/A-consuming libraries, we would like to assume this statement to be true: that something that is “thenable” actually behaves as a Promises/A promise, with all the power that entails.
<cjohnson>	this sounds like the fault of the author for assuming that "anything that works with promises must follow Promises/A+ exactly"
<cjohnson>	especially since, as I understand it, you can feed a thenable into Promise and now you not only have your promise, but using your preferred API
<cjohnson>	"thenable" is not the same word as "Promises/A+" for good reason
<ezakimak>	right. and jquery calls it's deferreds "promises" but really they are merely "thenables"
<cjohnson>	no, it does **not**
<ezakimak>	adding to the confusion
<cjohnson>	it says they "implement promises". it *calls* them deferreds
<ljharb>	cjohnson: es6 is not promises/a+. it's just based on that.
<cjohnson>	that one singular doc line that you quoted could prob be rewritten to say "thenable". but that's about it
<cjohnson>	I see
<ljharb>	but at this point, everything is either a thenable, or an es6-compliant promise/promise subclass.
<cjohnson>	haha. oh microsoft... https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br211867.aspx
<ezakimak>	cjohnson, have you looked at the Q api? it also has a "deferred" object with a Promise, same as jquery's Deferred object.
<ezakimak>	that *is* the promise interface, but jquery's simply doesn't have the same semantics
<cjohnson>	I dunno what else to tell ya
<cjohnson>	jquery calls them deferreds. not promises.
<ezakimak>	"deferred.promise()
<ezakimak>	Return a Deferred’s Promise object."
<cjohnson>	they aren't the same, because of the way jquery works (chainable functions return this to keep the chain going)
<ezakimak>	straight from jquery docs.
<cjohnson>	lmao
<cjohnson>	ok
<cjohnson>	that's exactly proving my point. they provide a method on their deferreds to return an actual promise instead of a deferred
<cjohnson>	further demonstrating that they are different
<cjohnson>	I need to go to bed
<ezakimak>	https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference#qdefer
<ezakimak>	hrm. sure looks familiar.
<bluezone>	all these brackets in higher order functions = ew
<ezakimak>	seems harder to read
<bluezone>	almost not legible :/
<cjohnson>	looked at arrow functions yet bluezone?
<bluezone>	maybe they should stick the function definitions on the same line
<bluezone>	no
<bluezone>	i'm still at chapter 5 or something
<cjohnson>	b> ['a', 'b', 'c'].forEach((x) => console.log(x))
<babelbot>	cjohnson: a b c undefined
<cjohnson>	instead of forEach(function(x) { console.log(x); })
<bluezone>	hmmm i guess that's a bit nicer
<cjohnson>	it also makes "this" less tricky since it doesn't get a new "this" but borrows from the parent scope
<ezakimak>	doesn't that mean each one actually creates *two* new functions?
<cjohnson>	hrm?
<ljharb>	ezakimak: npmjs.com/promise-deferred :-p
<ezakimak>	well i guess transcoding it has to, but native es6 could shortcut it
<cjohnson>	it makes one function that gets passed to the forEach method, which iterates the array elements and calls that one function for each element
<ezakimak>	ljharb, yep.
<ezakimak>	as i understand it it makes one function, then calls .bind(this) on it and returns the new bound function
<cjohnson>	for transpilation? yeah probably
<cjohnson>	but natively, it's just one function
<ezakimak>	in es5 each function created actually creates a 2nd object also
<cjohnson>	hrm?
<ezakimak>	the functions default prototype object
<cjohnson>	isn't the default just Function? which already exists?
<ezakimak>	it can't know when you declare a function if it will be used as a ctor or not
<ezakimak>	I don't think so.
<ezakimak>	>> function Foo() {}; Foo.prototype == Function;
<ecmabot>	ezakimak: (boolean) false
<cjohnson>	wouldn't it be == Function.prototype
<ezakimak>	>> function Foo() {}; Foo.prototype == Function.prototype;
<ecmabot>	ezakimak: (boolean) false
<cjohnson>	also are you sure ecmabot uses .prototype and not .__proto__ ?
<ezakimak>	you're thinking of it's actual prototype
<cjohnson>	>> function Foo(){}; Foo.__proto__ === Function.__proto__
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: (boolean) true
<ezakimak>	>> function Foo() {}; Object.getPrototypeOf(Foo) === Function;
<ecmabot>	ezakimak: (boolean) false
<ezakimak>	>> function Foo() {}; Object.getPrototype(Foo) === Function;
<ecmabot>	ezakimak: TypeError: Object.getPrototype is not a function
<ezakimak>	>> function Foo() {}; Object.getPrototypeOf(Foo) === Function.prototype;
<ecmabot>	ezakimak: (boolean) true
<ezakimak>	i'm talking about the default object created for the prototype property
<cjohnson>	why would it create an object? why wouldn't it be Function.prototype?
<ezakimak>	for prototypal inheritance
<cjohnson>	as you see with your last line
<cjohnson>	wouldn't it be one object created, the function, with a prototype of Function.prototype, which already exists
<cjohnson>	and then you can call that object, the function, with ()
<ezakimak>	the internal [prototype] is Function.prototype, but the "prototype" property is set to a new default empty object
<cjohnson>	>> function Foo(){}; Foo.__proto__ === Function.__proto__
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: (boolean) true
<ezakimak>	Foo.__proto__ != Foo.prototype
<cjohnson>	>> function Foo(){}; Foo.__proto__ === Foo.prototype
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: (boolean) false
<cjohnson>	I don't get it then
<ezakimak>	>> function Foo() {}; typeof Foo.prototype;
<ecmabot>	ezakimak: (string) 'object'
<ezakimak>	>> function Foo() {}; typeof Foo.__proto__;
<ecmabot>	ezakimak: (string) 'function'
<javascript410>	cjohnson and ezakimak sorry stepped away from my computer.  Many thanks for clarifying!  Appreciated!
<ezakimak>	when you invoke "var f = new Foo();"
<ezakimak>	an object is created, it's internal [prototype] (__proto__) is set to point to whatever Foo.prototype is, and is then passed to Foo() as the value of "this"
<ezakimak>	that's how prototypal inheritance works
<ezakimak>	also the objects 'constructor' property is set to point to Foo
<cjohnson>	what about when you use Object.create
<cjohnson>	does that skip the extra object step
<greves>	gah i always mess this stuff up in JS... what do i do to check if an object exists in an array based on one of the parameters on the objects in the array?
<greves>	i.e. [ {id: 3, ... }, {id: 4, ...}, ... ], i want to check if the object where id === 3 is in the array
<cjohnson>	greves: Array#filter
<ezakimak>	Object.create()'s parameter is the object you want to set as the new object's internal [prototype]
<greves>	cjohnson, i dont want to filter it, i just want a simple true or false for whether that object is in the array or not
<ezakimak>	Object.create isn't creating a function
<cjohnson>	greves: .filter().length > 0
<cjohnson>	boom, true or false
<ezakimak>	!mdn array some @ greves
<ecmabot>	greves: Array.prototype.some() - JavaScript | MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some>
<cjohnson>	oh yeah some is better since it will short circuit on the first match
<cjohnson>	but same deal
<greves>	oh some again
<greves>	wow that's like twice in a row i need to use some
<greves>	i'll try to remember next time :D
<ezakimak>	gotta get me some of that some some
<ezakimak>	cjohnson, it's really confusing at first, it took me weeks and diagramming it all out to see it
<cjohnson>	I get how prototypal inheritance works from a user perspective
<cjohnson>	I guess I don't care if it makes some wrapper object in the background
<ezakimak>	the big key is that every object has an internal prototype, but only functions have an actual "prototype" property set on them
<falafel>	!oop explains this afaik
<cjohnson>	!oop
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: http://robotlolita.me/2011/10/09/understanding-javascript-oop.html summarizes Object Oriented Programming in Javascript, using concepts from ECMAScript 5, and relating them back to older paradigms from ECMAScript 3
<falafel>	prototype is a blueprint for the actual [Prototype] of the object created with the constructor
<ezakimak>	but because any function could be used as a constructor, creating any function means it also creates an empty prototype object for it
<ezakimak>	maybe es6 will be able to skip that in some cases
<falafel>	yeah, functions have a prototype, that's the bottomline, other objects dont
<cjohnson>	what do other objects have
<falafel>	every object has the internal property, that may be created with new, or Object.create, or instantiating built-in objects
<ezakimak>	you can always discard it
<cjohnson>	what do you call the "internal prototype"?
<cjohnson>	__proto__?
<ezakimak>	[prototype]
<cjohnson>	I see
<falafel>	yeah, formally [[Prototype]]
<ezakimak>	__proto__ is non-standard
<cjohnson>	can you use obj.[[Prototype]] ?
<cjohnson>	and/or should you ever
<ezakimak>	i think it might actually be getting deprecated since not every browser supported it anyways
<falafel>	getPrototypeOf
<cjohnson>	or you'd use Object.getPrototypeOf
<ezakimak>	and setPrototypeOf
<falafel>	yup yup
<ezakimak>	which can be polyfilled via __proto__
<ezakimak>	__proto__ needs to go away though.
<falafel>	but it is a rare thing to do
<falafel>	prototype chains should be immutable
<falafel>	as much as possible
<ezakimak>	only for doing your own special type of object-orientedness really
<cjohnson>	oh ok it just clicked
<cjohnson>	that's why you do func.prototype.foo = function()...
<ezakimak>	I use it in some factory patterns
<cjohnson>	you're setting it on that empty shell object you made
<cjohnson>	when you created the function
<ezakimak>	yes
<ezakimak>	replacing it with what you want it to be
<cjohnson>	and then theFunc.[[Prototype]] is actually Function.prototype
<ezakimak>	right
<cjohnson>	so when you do func.prototype = something you're probably wrong in doing so?
<ezakimak>	see, tricky. :)
<ezakimak>	no
<ezakimak>	that's a common pattern
<cjohnson>	for subclassing?
<ezakimak>	yes
<cjohnson>	er not even
<falafel>	not really, you are overwriting what was previously there
<cjohnson>	because now you can't add any extra prototype methods tho
<ezakimak>	by default it's just an empty object
<falafel>	if it is the top parent constructor, then it is ok
<cjohnson>	if you do .prototype =
<falafel>	if you do it further down, then you break it
<ezakimak>	all depends what behavior you want with your objects--it's very flexible
<cjohnson>	when would you want to do .prototype = ?
<ezakimak>	I actualy do it with error objects :)
<falafel>	cjohnson, not very often that I can think of
<ezakimak>	I have a lib that makes custom error objects, and preserves everything in the process
<cjohnson>	I do it in the road
<cjohnson>	yeah it seems very odd to want to set the prototype *exactly* to something else
<cjohnson>	like maybe only if you wanted an Array, and exactly an Array, but with a custom init method... in which case I'd just use a factory
<ezakimak>	so that MyCustomError can inherit from Error
<cjohnson>	maybe not Array, but some other type
<ezakimak>	it doesn't work with arrays
<ezakimak>	unfortunately
<ezakimak>	that would be really useful
<falafel>	it does in ES6 afaik
<cjohnson>	yeah was just gonna say that
<cjohnson>	but anyway it sounds like you'd just want to use a factory method instead for the most part
<ezakimak>	i worked out why once, it was subtle
<cjohnson>	just make a regular object without messing with its prototype and then modify it after the fact and return the modified object
<cjohnson>	ok awesome
<cjohnson>	makes much more sense
<falafel>	makes more sense to avoid inheritance in general
<ezakimak>	but the flexibility of being able to control what prototype points to allows tons of different patterns
<cjohnson>	yeah true that. I very rarely use it
<cjohnson>	just thinking about when you might want to, if you used inheritance
<ezakimak>	once you get used to not needing it, when you actually really do need it becomes apparent and it's there
<falafel>	most forms of inheritance can be turned into function application. I'd use prototypes if I need some form of ad-hoc polymorphism
<falafel>	that's what I thin kit is useful for
<falafel>	*think it
<cjohnson>	neat
<ezakimak>	i usually use it as interface inheritance instead of object inheritance
<falafel>	structural sharing
<ezakimak>	eg, i have a datamodel prototype that knows how to de/serialize itself
<cjohnson>	yeah I try not to go crazy with classical stuff
<preaction>	i'm more into rap myself
<cjohnson>	lmao
<forQuery>	var mikhail = Object.create(null)  is the same as var mikhail = {} I think?
<falafel>	forQuery, not the same, Object.create(null) creates an object that inherits from nothing, not even Object
<forQuery>	got it
<ezakimak>	>> var mikhail = Object.create(null); Object.getPrototypeOf(mikhail);
<ecmabot>	ezakimak: (object) null
<ezakimak>	>> Object.getPrototypeOf({}) == Object.prototype;
<ecmabot>	ezakimak: (boolean) true
<forQuery>	:)
<ezakimak>	is there a "js" term for such an empty object?
<ezakimak>	"bare"?
<falafel>	an object dot create null object
<ezakimak>	i thought i read a term for it somewhere once
<falafel>	"bare" sounds reasonable
<ezakimak>	handy when working with large datasets probably
<ezakimak>	wouldn't surprise me if d3 and the like used them extensively
<tejasmanohar>	anyone have a really simple css grid?
<tejasmanohar>	i looked at Skeleton and its escaping mmy hate for Bootstrap
<ezakimak>	there's 100s of them
<tejasmanohar>	but like i JUST want the grid
<ezakimak>	hang on, I found a page listing a ton the other day
<falafel>	I use this one http://jeet.gs/
<forQuery>	yeah that's only 350 lines of scss
<ezakimak>	http://usablica.github.io/front-end-frameworks/compare.html
<tejasmanohar>	ooh looking at jeet
<ezakimak>	1kb grid?
<ezakimak>	i was looking at baseline--it looked promising, until i read that it's all done via px
<tejasmanohar>	hm
<falafel>	I dont like grids ala Bootstrap, I'd rather set the styles in css
<ezakimak>	i hate boostrap. it's more of a hinderance imo
<falafel>	agreed
<falafel>	I use that jeet grid plus this https://github.com/jenius/rupture
<falafel>	and got everything basic needs covers
<falafel>	covered*
<forQuery>	when you say hinderance... what do you mean?
<forQuery>	is it because of filesize?
<falafel>	non-semantic markup, and bad class names
<falafel>	but?
<falafel>	seriously, couldn't they use "button"...
<ezakimak>	i may have to look at jeet some more later. looks nice though.
<falafel>	maybe they have an alias, dunno
<tejasmanohar>	ooh ive done something like
<tejasmanohar>	$desktop: "(min-width: 1024px)"; @media #{$desktop} {
<tejasmanohar>	in sass
<tejasmanohar>	or scss moreover
<ezakimak>	it's huge is one problem. if you really want to hear some rants go ask that question in #css
<forQuery>	ah, yes... you get used to class names after quick while.  but, i see what you mean
<falafel>	in stylus + rupture `.semantic{+below(mobile){}}`
<preaction>	i would prefer rants to be taken someplace other than #css
<tejasmanohar>	rupture looks really nice
<tejasmanohar>	#rants
<ezakimak>	no, I'm saying if you ask "what's wrong with boostrap" in #css *they* will rant at you
<ezakimak>	they generally hate it much worse
<preaction>	and _i'm_ saying if you know it will start a rant, keep it out of #css
<falafel>	I feel like things like bootstrap lock you in too much
<socialblogsite>	is there any function to regex “extract” a substring from another string? I know how to match, how to replace, but I don’t know how to “extract” the string in one step (add it to a new variable AND removing it from the initial string)
<falafel>	with dynamic grid systems you can do anything you want
<tejasmanohar>	ik what bootstrap is good for tho
<ezakimak>	my *point* is that people that know css much better than I also dislike it for even more reasons than I have
<tejasmanohar>	makking a quick admin portal with crappy design but decent usability
<tejasmanohar>	internal use only
<falafel>	that's a good use case, I suppose
<ezakimak>	it's good for $10/hr contractors offshore
<falafel>	you know what is bad for? your next big thing
<falafel>	ecause everybody and their moms knows it is bootstrap
<tejasmanohar>	:P yes
<ezakimak>	last i checked half of yeoman recipes included it
<tejasmanohar>	ezakimak: yeah that too
<tejasmanohar>	i think its good for admin portals tho
<tejasmanohar>	and for internal apps
<ezakimak>	that and other cruft i'd rather avoid
<tejasmanohar>	because i dont know about you but i dont like wasting time styling an admin portal
<forQuery>	anyone know of a regular expression resource that helped them a lot?
<ezakimak>	lol, which is why i just don't
<ezakimak>	they can have browser defaults.
<ezakimak>	the bible.
<socialblogsite>	bootstrap is not SEO friendly, or bandwith wise unless you have a website with hundreds of pages constantly generated by minions. The HTML gets full of classes, and the tradeof for consistency is only useful if you generating the pages is harder (and many) than the lightweight you need the pages. (Twitter doesn’t need to rank on Google. You do)
<ezakimak>	the oreily book by friedl
<falafel>	regularexpressions.info
<falafel>	that classic
<ezakimak>	there's some really awesome visual regex builder tools out there
<socialblogsite>	regex101.com
<forQuery>	bootstrap uses TONS of extra elements too.  container in a row in a col in a btn-toolbar in a btn-group in a button...  all just cause you neede one button with a wrapper div.
<ezakimak>	kde used to have an awesome regex app that was visual
<ezakimak>	yeah, jquery-ui does similar
<falafel>	true that, lol div.container>div.row>div.col-md-12.col-sm-6>div.YOURACTUALFUCKINGTHING
<ezakimak>	makes your dom very heavy
<ezakimak>	and you can't custom style it without first figuring out what they did with your thing
<falafel>	yes you can, !important
<falafel>	lmao
<ezakimak>	but you gotta *find* it first nested under all their crap
<socialblogsite>	is there a regex replace function in JS that outputs the the match AND the final replaced string?
<falafel>	socialblogsite, what are you trying to do? input/output expected?
<ezakimak>	!mdn string replace
<ecmabot>	ezakimak: String.prototype.replace() - JavaScript | MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace>
<falafel>	you can use the callback for many things, in combination with closures
<oojacoboo>	what's up with js and @type being number and not integer?
<socialblogsite>	falafel: input: “whole string with substring” output “whole string with” and “substring” where the regex was /substring/
<oojacoboo>	is that the actual type in js?
<falafel>	it is like a proper regex + capture groups iteration
<ezakimak>	oojacoboo, ?
<oojacoboo>	ezakimak: http://usejsdoc.org/tags-type.html
<cjohnson>	socialblogsite: it's pretty rough to build responsive grid-based websites without tons of classes in your code
<cjohnson>	bootstrap or otherwise
<oojacoboo>	cjohnson: not if you properly cascade
<oojacoboo>	problem is, most people have no clue how to write css
<falafel>	>>"whole string with substring".replace(/substring/, function(_,m){console.log(m); return ''}) @ socialblogsite
<ecmabot>	socialblogsite: (string) 'whole string with '; Console: 18
<falafel>	>>"whole string with substring".replace(/substring/, function(m){console.log(m); return ''}) @ socialblogsite
<ecmabot>	socialblogsite: (string) 'whole string with '; Console: 'substring'
<oojacoboo>	selector specificity isn't a bad thing
<cjohnson>	but it has a negligible impact on bandwidth honestly, unless you're tlaking **massive** pages. which also means negligible impact on SEO (assuming you mean the SEO would suffer as a result of slower page speed, which actually isn't that big of a factor beyond "is it super slow? no? you're fine")
<falafel>	mmm, ah you need a capture group
<ezakimak>	oojacoboo, is this a jsdoc question? or a typescript question?
<falafel>	>>"whole string with substring".replace(/(substring)/, function(_,m){console.log(m); return ''}) @ socialblogsite
<ecmabot>	socialblogsite: (string) 'whole string with '; Console: 'substring'
<cjohnson>	oojacoboo: eh not really. cascading doesn't solve the problem
<socialblogsite>	cjohnson: You are right. That’s why you either invest on a good SEO oriented designer to do the clean hard job, or pay Google for positioning. Clean small html requires a lot of work, yes.
<oojacoboo>	ezakimak: jsdoc and js as a whole really
<falafel>	socialblogsite, those examples work, with an without capture group
<cjohnson>	small HTML isn't *that* valuable, especially if you're talking about google ranking
<falafel>	replace removes the word, and in the callback you get access to the matched string, plus any capture groups
<socialblogsite>	falafel: cool. thanks.
<cjohnson>	it's on the low end of hte totem pole
<oojacoboo>	cjohnson: it can help a lot with class overload
<socialblogsite>	great!
<oojacoboo>	so can selector specificity
<cjohnson>	what do you mean by that
<socialblogsite>	I knew there should be something with callback like in php :)
<cjohnson>	selector specificity helps a *bit* but not much in regards to creating responsive grid-based pages
<falafel>	socialblogsite, it is basically like preg_replace_callback
<oojacoboo>	cjohnson: responsive grid or whatever, doesn't matter
<cjohnson>	it only helps if you're just arbitrarily throwing a thousand columns on everything instead of only where it matters
<ezakimak>	oojacoboo, i don't understand the question
<cjohnson>	well no, it does matter
<oojacoboo>	cjohnson: the DOM is the same - doesn't matter
<cjohnson>	make a page that reflows certain elements to take up 100% width on certain sizes, and 50% width on certain sizes
<cjohnson>	without using a bunch of column classes
<oojacoboo>	you only need to specify classes for specific items that can't be reached otherwise, or needed for speed
<cjohnson>	or having very fragile code
<cjohnson>	in which case now you're moving html bloat into CSS
<cjohnson>	it's gonna take a lot of work either way
<Heldure>	oh man I didnt see the bootstrap convo earlier. fuck bootstrap tho. I still have to cast my vote.
<oojacoboo>	cjohnson: I don't agree with fragile - use web components
<cjohnson>	hah
<ezakimak>	i hate how most css frameworks work in general--wanting you to explicitly style each thing with a class, rather than let you set a style for everything inside something with a specific class
<cjohnson>	ok
<cjohnson>	it's a balance of genericism, bloat, and fragility
<oojacoboo>	ezakimak++
<cjohnson>	you don't get to get away with all 3
<cjohnson>	or if you do, you're not really talking about the same thing
<ezakimak>	i shouldn't have to add 'btn' to every <button>
<falafel>	cjohnson, but instead of column classes you use semantic classes, in the end in my experience you end up with less nesting in your HTML, and a bit more CSS code, it is worth it
*	ezakimak agrees with falafel
<cjohnson>	sure, that's one end of the spectrum falafel
<cjohnson>	it's a balance of both approaches
<ezakimak>	and the css gets reduced if you use sass/less
<cjohnson>	that's what I said earlier
<cjohnson>	if you're just tossing a thousand columns on everything you're doing it wrong
<cjohnson>	you should use specific semantic classes where applicable, but it's not always applicable
<oojacoboo>	cjohnson: I can't agree - I'm sorry.  I've written massive amounts of css with extreme complexity - all custom.  99% of the time, people have no idea what they're doing, adding a class to everything b/c they dont' understand how css works
<cjohnson>	and again you're just trading html bloat for CSS bloat
<cjohnson>	I'm not talking about incompetent CSS devs oojacoboo
<oojacoboo>	cjohnson: nor am I
<cjohnson>	that has nothing to do with the value of a framework
<cjohnson>	uh
<cjohnson>	you just did
<oojacoboo>	I'm talking about 99% of devs
<cjohnson>	yes, exactly
<oojacoboo>	most js devs haven't the slightest
<falafel>	css is whatever works for you, it is freeland, it is not necessarily bad
<cjohnson>	people being clueless about css doesn't discredit bootstrap's value
<preaction>	99% == everyone that isn't me
<cjohnson>	preaction: ;)
<oojacoboo>	preaction: not true
<oojacoboo>	there are some great css devs
<cjohnson>	me and my friends
<oojacoboo>	it's just rare
<cjohnson>	and that one guy I saw in the wild
<cjohnson>	:P
<oojacoboo>	you have terrible js devs that like to build things like bootstrap and ruin everything
<falafel>	there dozens of ways of doing something is css, depending on the situation, and many times there is no "right way", just they way it works it is the way it is
<cjohnson>	anyway "fuck bootstrap it sux" is just as clueless as "omg bootstrap rox"
<cjohnson>	it's all a balance
<cjohnson>	there's def downsides to giving up the genericism it gives you, like anything
<oojacoboo>	of course
<ezakimak>	litmus test: do you use/recommend a css reset and/or normalize?
<Heldure>	my vote stands
<cjohnson>	exactly^
<cjohnson>	lol
<falafel>	what we are discussing is what works for "me" is it any better than what works for "you"? The holy wars
<cjohnson>	clueless
<preaction>	as long as this stays out of #css, i don't care :p
<oojacoboo>	ezakimak: I personally prefer a reset, but that's just me
<oojacoboo>	I also normalize my own way
<Heldure>	lmao, I'm glad you're interested.
<falafel>	I enjoy css though
<oojacoboo>	I do as well actually
<falafel>	or Stylus rather
<ezakimak>	i would hazard that most of the best-of-the-best css gurus would not consider a reset or normalize--at least not in the way most devs would think to treat them
<oojacoboo>	ezakimak: depends on how you prefer to style
<ezakimak>	however, context matters. there's a difference between a website ful of documents/pages and an SPA
<oojacoboo>	if you want to force browser styling to match, you don't have a choice
<oojacoboo>	if you're focused on usability and content, less so
<socialblogsite>	falafel: if I want the replace to remove the match I just have to return “” in the callback, right?
<oojacoboo>	There are appropriate ways to normalize though and if you do that after a reset, you can get a great baseline
<falafel>	socialblogsite, yeah
<socialblogsite>	:)
<socialblogsite>	is there a thumbs-up emoticon?
<oojacoboo>	|3
<oojacoboo>	b
<ezakimak>	not sure what that is
<ezakimak>	lol
<oojacoboo>	:P
<ezakimak>	<oops> a non l o l zone
<forQuery>	without getting into a discussion about premature optimization :)   technically speaking... if you used something like options.lifetime two times inside a function... is it faster to create var lifetimeOptions = options.lifetime; and use that newly created variable lifetimeOptions two times... instead of options.lifetime twice.
<falafel>	barely
<falafel>	object lookups are O(1)
<forQuery>	but, if it's 20 times inside a function and is object.x.y.z then... it probably has more benefit?
<oojacoboo>	forQuery: I typically find variable setting at the top of a method to be a positive pattern, regardless of the speed benefits.
<oojacoboo>	internally within our company, it's a code pattern we follow, regardless
<forQuery>	oh, cool... so you would redefine them into a single local variable.
<forQuery>	yea, im going to do the same.  Thx falafel and oojacoboo
<oojacoboo>	forQuery: not always
<oojacoboo>	if it's local to an object, there isn't really a need there
<oojacoboo>	but if it's some form of computation or lookup, etc, yes
<forQuery>	by local object you mean... if you are using tim.x.y.z inside the object tim.
<oojacoboo>	yes, b/c it's already defined within that same object.  To create another variable is just going to hog up more memory
<oojacoboo>	I'm not sure there is any speed benefit to creating another variable there
<oojacoboo>	in fact, I'd bet there is a speed hit
<mengu>	hi all. is there anyway to modify the url but not actually push it?
<cjohnson>	depends what you want to do with the variable
<cjohnson>	if you're talking about an object property that you want to change in the function body, a "quick reference" variable would be pointless since strings are immutable
<cjohnson>	object property which is a string*
<forQuery>	cause, i have this one function inside the tim object that gets called every other second... and it has about 20 of tim.x.y.z ...  so i was going to define it as var timxyz;
<cjohnson>	definitely ignore any sort of performance aspect of it forQuery. It's so incredibly negligible that even spending a single second of thought about optimizing it is wasted time
<cjohnson>	use a profiler if you want to find slow downs
<forQuery>	Kk
<falafel>	yeah, optimize for readability though, it seems like caching is good if you have 20 instances writing the same thing over and over
<cjohnson>	yeah
<forQuery>	got it... thank you
<cjohnson>	if tim.x.y.z is a string for instance you could do var foo = tim.x.y;  then do foo.z = 'new foo';
<falafel>	but it also looks like an indication that function should be broken up in smaller functions
<cjohnson>	good point
<cjohnson>	make a sub function that you pass tim.x.y to which then operates on arg.z
<cjohnson>	or further down the functional hole if you want :)
<cjohnson>	hah
<cjohnson>	less mutable state is better
<cjohnson>	shared
<forQuery>	yes.  my functions are a page long.  I didnt know.  i need to fix this.
<falafel>	rule of thumb, more than 10-15 lines, time to refactor
<falafel>	there are exceptions, but that's the rule I follow
<ezakimak>	you don't write a single main() function that does everything? :)
<forQuery>	([ [?]⁣[Prototype] [?]⁣])
<forQuery>	anyone know what the mario coin boxes mean?
<falafel>	where di you get that?
<falafel>	*did
<forQuery>	http://robotlolita.me/2011/10/09/understanding-javascript-oop.html  it's a square with question mark inside... used a bunch of times on this article
<falafel>	forQuery, I can't find it
<falafel>	maybe an issue with your browser and font rendering dunno...
<forQuery>	section 3.2 has it
<falafel>	can you point to a phrase near a place where you see that forQuery ?
<cjohnson>	hahaha mario coin boxes
<forQuery>	yea, must be that...
<cjohnson>	I saw it that way too actually
<falafel>	yeah, I don't see it
<cjohnson>	it looked like [][Prototype][] or so
<cjohnson>	https://i.imgur.com/7WZnikW.png
<falafel>	yah, that looks like some font issue
<cjohnson>	methinks prob on the server/article
<ezakimak>	or utf8 support problem possibly
<cjohnson>	charCodeAt is 8291
<falafel>	yeah, I copy/pasted in Vim, I see it now
<falafel>	but my Chrome renders it fine...
<cjohnson>	I never have any utf8 font probs on my machine
<ezakimak>	http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/8291/index.htm ?

<okdamn>	how do i get a random item from that array?
<matthavard>	I have a little app where an image is displayed on screen, and you can press a key to go to the next or previous image.  I am using this: https://gist.github.com/mhavard999/fa5632381e68cbd59dee to preoload images.  In the Network tab of Chrome dev tools, it shows that all the images are loading successfully.  But when I go to the next image, there is always a split second jump as if the image is loading, even thgouh it is already
<matthavard>	loaded.
<okdamn>	like… array[Math.random(0, Object.keys(object).length)]; ??

<joker89>	Hi, is any tool to share javascript state reported for a client from you site?
<okdamn>	falafel:  do i am sure i will get an array item?
<GreenJello>	joker89, define 'state'
<falafel>	give it a try
<GreenJello>	as in, you can load the application exactly the way it looked for them, or you can see the html and maybe some objects you specifically log?
<okdamn>	falafel:  this? array[Math.random(0, Object.keys(object).length)];
<okdamn>	i need to get it from inside the array but to be sure to get it :D
<GreenJello>	okdamn, look at the link
<nszceta>	how can i store up to several gigabytes of data offline?
<nszceta>	"Both Session and Local Storage will typically be able to store around 5 MB of data per domain, which is significantly more than cookies."
<GreenJello>	nszceta, indexeddb
<okdamn>	ah aww yes thanks falafel
<nszceta>	thanks GreenJello
<GreenJello>	rule of thumb is you get 10% of the user's un used hard drive space
<nszceta>	makes sense. i need this for a HIPAA compliant offline web application
<GreenJello>	don't expect it to work well on most Windows XP computers
<nszceta>	good news is XP is irrelevant
<nszceta>	target is Win7 and up
<lite_>	js> !!!foo
<ecmabot>	lite_: ReferenceError: foo is not defined
<GreenJello>	ah nice for the medical field :-)
<nszceta>	GreenJello how do you back up an IndexedDB
<GreenJello>	nszceta, I haven't used it directly; and I don't think most people do (e.g. there are implementations of sql rdbms's on top of it)
<nszceta>	ok
<wast0>	http://jsfiddle.net/sWfYm/40/ I can't get this bind working in my website, any idea what would be the problem? I don't get any error in console
<GreenJello>	what does $($("#sublime-scroll-iframe").contents()[0], window) return?
<GreenJello>	specifically, check the length property
<wast0>	it returns [ #document ]
<wast0>	[] is array right? it shouldnt be
<GreenJello>	okay, and in the handler put a console.log($("#result").length)
<wast0>	$($("#sublime-scroll-iframe").contents()[0], window)[0] returns #document
<GreenJello>	and yeah, it's kinda an array; it's a jQuery collection
<wast0>	sec
<wast0>	what am i testing with console.log($("#result").length) ?
<wast0>	it returns 1
<wast0>	mousemove event wont trigger
<socialblogsite>	I’m trying to DELETE some substring with replace() and returning “” in the callback doesn’t do the trick. Am I missing something?
<socialblogsite>	the matched group is returned ok, though, so IT IS matching something.*
<falafel>	socialblogsite, strings are immutable
<falafel>	socialblogsite, did you assign the variable to the result?
<socialblogsite>	I meant “the matched group is PASSED ok to the callback"
<furoido>	does anyone experience issue with fonts when using grunt?
<furoido>	when minifing css, the font is gone
<falafel>	furoido, copy the fonts over to the output folder, match the path
<falafel>	it is not a problem with the fonts, but the css must be saved somehwere else, where the relative path of the fonts inside the css doesn't find anything
<furoido>	yeah i noticed. it just call the font name
<furoido>	not the directory
<furoido>	maybe i should just create a font folder
<falafel>	yeah
<socialblogsite>	falafel: Oh! I didn’t find you in the list of online users :) I used somestring.replace(/a/, function(match,capt_group){ found_string = capt_group; return ""})
<socialblogsite>	the captured group is assigned fine.
<falafel>	socialblogsite, that won't make `somestring` change
<socialblogsite>	but returning “” doesn’t change somestring
<falafel>	again, stirngs are immutable
<falafel>	somestring is immutable
<socialblogsite>	oh
<falafel>	or rather, the value of sometring, which is a string, is immutable
<socialblogsite>	:(
<falafel>	somestring = somestring.replace...
<falafel>	socialblogsite, it is a good thing that strings are immutable
<socialblogsite>	kinda guessed it when  you mentioned the inmutable thing.
<socialblogsite>	thanks :)
<socialblogsite>	it’s a good thing to learn it two hours later :)
<socialblogsite>	it means I will never forget it :P
<falafel>	socialblogsite, primitives are immutable, so strings, numbers, booleans, null, and undefined
<DERIIIFranz>	is there a more efficient way to deep-copy an object than jquery's 'extend'?
<socialblogsite>	falafel: so I could change a value in an array, but not the array itself, correct?

<falafel>	DERIIIFranz, not sure how efficient that is, test it in jsperf to see

<pi->	>> foo(); function foo(){console.log("bar");} // but I think JS lets you use then define
<ecmabot>	pi-: undefined; Console: 'bar'
<DERIIIFranz>	oh :D
<falafel>	DERIIIFranz, it is native, in that you don't need any libraries to use it
<falafel>	!fd vs fe
<falafel>	!fe vs fd @ pi-
<ecmabot>	pi-: A function declaration `function declared() {}` & a function expression e.g. `var bar = function expressed() {}`: the former is !hoisted, the latter can be immediately invoked (see !iife) and can be anonymous (eg can omit the name "expressed"). "function" as the first word of a statement at global scope or directly inside a function starts a function declaration; otherwise, it starts a function expression.
<DragonPunch>	l
<DragonPunch>	\o
<pi->	!hoisted
<ecmabot>	pi-: ‘Hoisting’ is the name given to the mechanism whereby names defined with ‘var’ or function declarations (see !fe) are made available throughout their scope, even before the declaration is encountered textually.  Beware: though the *definition* of a variable is available, its value (if given) will be undefined until the var declaration is encountered or the variable is otherwise assigned to.
<tarkus>	How do you think, is Node.js/io.js + JavaScript/Babel is good enought for server-side development, or it's better to use something like Go or .NET?
<tarkus>	For example in .NET (F#) you have type checking and stuff like that
*	meandi_1 is now known as meandi
<falafel>	tarkus, in Node too if you want, are you asking about platforms or languages?
<furoido>	falafel: thank you, its working great now
<tarkus>	falafel, each platform has its own language.. same question I guess
<pi->	Is it possible to write Python code in a .html, and have some third party 'Python->Java' transcoder convert it on-the-fly?  So that the page I host on my server contains the Python?  (as opposed to me throwing it through some tool that generates a .js page, and exposing *that*)
<falafel>	tarkus, not really though... You can write any language that compiles to JavaScript in Node, as you can use any language that runs on the JVM, or CLR
<DERIIIFranz>	is there a deep-copy-function for underscore.js?
<tarkus>	falafel, as far as I understand in case with Node/io.js you depend on tones of small tiny libraries from different vendors, which often break when new versions are released.. is that correct?
*	michd is now known as MichD
<Heldure>	I was learning about hoisting last night, kinda easy to understand but not understand where I would use it.
<falafel>	tarkus, I wouldn't say so, no. That's a choice you make. You can go with a big framework too if you want, you have the same options or more than in other platforms
<tarkus>	falafel, in comparison to .net where most of the stuff comes from a single vendor
<falafel>	tarkus, that's particularly why Node is desirable
<pi->	Heldure: Everytime you first USE `foo()` and then subsequently define `function foo(){...}` you are making use of it.
<falafel>	vendor lock-in is not a good move in many cases
<falafel>	in most cases I'd say
<tarkus>	falafel, it seems like disadnantage to me, since each vendor has its owen API style, coding standards etc. a total mess :)
<pi->	I like to do this in my code because I like the idea that someone can read it in a linear manner and it will make sense.
<Heldure>	pi-, oh okay, I can see that happening. I just wondered because I hadn't ran into that being an issue so far as I'm learning so I wondered why the video I was watching was going over it for so long.
<willv2>	Heldure: It's rare to run into it... but when you do, if you don't know about it. You'll probably go bald.
<Heldure>	lol true
<falafel>	tarkus, we have coding standards in JS as well, and API styles, why does it have to be one true only one? The web is still exploratory
<mariuscc>	is there a google analytics channel ?
<okdamn>	if i have var object; then i do delete object[id]; then doing Object.keys(object) will id be in there?
<nkuttler>	mariuscc: there is #google..
<mariuscc>	thanks
<okdamn>	sorry forget, don't mind :D
<faysal>	hi guys
<faysal>	how can i set action for all dialog widgets in javascript
<ankr>	first define dialog widgets
<faysal>	my concern is $(dialog).dialog('widget').focusin and focusout
<faysal>	taken from jquery
<faysal>	if i have like 10 widgets and want all widgets to behave almost the same when having focusin and focusout
<ashiterator>	you set the respective callbacks on every instance?
<faysal>	ashiterator, didn't quite understand exactly what you mean ?
<ashiterator>	if you want the same things done for everything
<ashiterator>	you set the same callbacks for everything, maybe referencing stuff in a closure
<ashiterator>	or however you keep track of the object
<ashiterator>	dialog_xyz onfocus -> dialog_xyz.dostruff()
<ksmth>	hey people
<ksmth>	I'm thinking about how to best implement element queries and at some point I think I'd need to use getBoundingClientRect
<ksmth>	now I know that it's triggering layout. but it's not triggering layout right if you didn't change anything the last time layout happened, right?
*	WrksOnMyMachine is now known as Guest69714
<Kitsune>	Hi everyone, knowing the cursor's position. What's the best way to estimate which corner of the window it is in? (trying to return something like, top right / bottom left / center center)
<ksmth>	you have window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight
<ksmth>	and onmousemove you get clientX clientY
<Maxdamantus>	I imagine window.innerWidth would be considered bad.
<Maxdamantus>	maybe document.body.clientWidth
<Maxdamantus>	Actually, no, that'll be different.
<ksmth>	what's wrong with window.innerWidth?
<furoido>	im uglifying my script right now,
<Kitsune>	since the value is a range of numbers and if i set the corners too be specific, how exactly do i code it so that if it's near those numbers (of course top left is 0, 0 so say it's 15, 15?
<furoido>	but how do i uglify links have v parameter?
<furoido>	ex. fancybox-buttons.js?v=1.0.5
<furoido>	do i just add 'fancybox-buttons.js' on my list of files?
<ksmth>	i.e. to know whether you're on the left, you divide window.innerWidth / 2
<ksmth>	if clientX > window.innerWidth / 2 → east
<ksmth>	if clientY > window.innerHeight / 2 → north
<ksmth>	err, south …
<ksmth>	but you get the idea, right?
<Maxdamantus>	Note that that divides it into quadrants.
<ksmth>	you can also define your corners as points { x: 0, y: 0 } → top left, { x: window.innerWidth, y : 0 } → top right, etc. and then measure / compare the distance to those points
<azx>	Why cant i use the 'this' keyword when defining a prototype within an object
<azx>	is it better to define a prototype outside of the object function?
<DERIIIFranz>	how to achieve: var x = {foo:'bar'}; var y = x; delete x['foo'];   what I expect is to not delete 'foo' from x as well, but only from y
<Sharaal>	azx: definitions of the prototype function should be always outside the constructor function. cause the constructor function is executed for every object, the function definitions only must defined once
<falafel>	DERIIIFranz, they are the same exact object
<DERIIIFranz>	*sry I obviously ment:   delete y['foo']
<DERIIIFranz>	hm...
<falafel>	azx, what do you mean? define a prototype within an object?
<Sharaal>	DERIIIFranz: make a copy of the object
<azx>	Thank you very much, that makes perfect sense
<azx>	constructor is what i meant to say
<DERIIIFranz>	Sharaal: do mean a deepCopy?
<Sharaal>	DERIIIFranz: you assign the reference to the same object to another variable. don't do it, make a copy of the object and assign this reference to the copied object to the other variable
<Sharaal>	DERIIIFranz: low or deep copy, depends on what oyu want
<Kitsune>	ksmth: that makes sense! got myself a starting point now, thank you
<Sharaal>	DERIIIFranz: but yes
<DERIIIFranz>	Sharaal: is this possible without a deep copy as well?
<Sharaal>	DERIIIFranz: your object has a deep of one, no difference between copy and deep copy
<DERIIIFranz>	Sharaal: sure, but that's just an example. I'm handling deeper objects
<Sharaal>	DERIIIFranz: depends on what you need, if you need a deep copy then yes you should do it :)
<GreenJello>	DERIIIFranz, you can also do deep updates on objects which gives you immutability, but isn't as expensive as a full deep clone
<falafel>	or use Object.create, and change own properties, share the rest
<falafel>	it all depends on what you want
<GreenJello>	falafel, they said deep objects
<GreenJello>	something like this https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/update.html (not sure if it's packaged separately anywhere)
<falafel>	I think that was the suggestion, not sure OPs question was clear enough
<falafel>	an example would help
<falafel>	I think is basically the idea of cursors, lenses, etc
<falafel>	GreenJello,
<GreenJello>	yeah you could use a lib that provides that stuff, but then you have to wrap it in their structures, and tie all of your code to that
<GreenJello>	I like to keep things as plain objects and arrays
<falafel>	you can do it with plain objects, but you'd use functions to manipulate cursors, it depends on the implementation
<falafel>	the magic is in the composition of these functions
<falafel>	not on the objects themselves
<falafel>	or not always at least
<pi->	https://gist.github.com/anonymous/463fa5d03c8b8d8221f9 <-- can anyone see a cleaner structure for this?  I'm thinking actually a goto might be the cleanest way to do it (supposing JS has goto).
<Sharaal>	goto -> never
<falafel>	it'd be clearer with braces on the same lines
<Sharaal>	pi-: I would use a do/while instead of a while(true)
<falafel>	in JS it'll bite you sooner or later
<falafel>	also the intent seems a bit missed in between the details, so you want to create 12 balls, and do something for each one? How about aiming for something like `var balls = range(1,12).map(makeBall)`
<Sharaal>	pi-: and split the complete logic into little functions and give them a clear name for better understanding what this bunch of code really do
<Sharaal>	exactly what falafel say :)
<pi->	yes, that's the sort of stuff I'm after. Trying to make it is as clear as possible what's going on.
<GreenJello>	also avoid single letter variable names
<Eppiox>	for understanding, i -hate- that range() and .map are meant to be way more efficent in making arrays in js, to me it makes for really poor readability
<pi->	I better look into range & map.
<falafel>	pi-, start with the end result, and make it work, that's basically testing first approach; wishful thinking
<falafel>	imagine the best API, then work your way there
<falafel>	forget about what you got, just imagine you do. " no built-in range? no problem, I'll implement it"
<Eppiox>	pi- it's to reduce overheads from memory and to mitigate running into to some problems later if you do web heavy stuff.  I still use blabla = [] and add to blabla and have not had any issue-
<pi->	Oh I have it working: http://jsbin.com/xaviferafi/1/
<pi->	I'm just trying to improve the coding style.
<Sharaal>	its not working, performance is really bad
<falafel>	works here, but yeah, performance not sure why it looks a bit choppy
<pi->	falafel: yes, that's what I've got a habit of doing! Working from the top down, always creating my ideal API and then figuring out how to implement it later.
<Eppiox>	works here too
<Sharaal>	seems like your collision detected blocks the whole animations for seconds
<Sharaal>	*detection
<GreenJello>	it's not that slow for me..
<pi->	Sharaal: Interesting, what browser/OS/machine?
<Sharaal>	pi-: mac, ff 33
<pi->	falafel: what browser/OS/machine?
<falafel>	linux, chrome 42
<Sharaal>	on mac, chrome 42 it does not work, balls overlaps much here ^^
<GreenJello>	57fps
<Eppiox>	Sharaal if it runs, it 'works' but with issues
<GreenJello>	chrome osx
<fiatjaf>	is it possible to turn a sync function into an async (non-blocking) function? in the browser?
<pi->	woo zOMG Firefox on my Macbook is KILLING it!
<GreenJello>	here's it with a fps counter http://jsbin.com/namubi/2/edit?js,console,output
<Sharaal>	fiatjaf: by using setTimeout or I have in mind there is something with next tick
<GreenJello>	yeah 20fps in firefox
<GreenJello>	about expected, ff is only fast if you use webgl
<Eppiox>	69 fps here in ff
<Eppiox>	but it chops randomly
<fiatjaf>	Sharaal: what is a tick?
*	WrksOnMyMachine is now known as Guest15154
<GreenJello>	that's because of the random in a loop
<GreenJello>	understandable
<pi->	Wow. This is very informative. I'm glad I posted.
<falafel>	yah, FF is way choppier for me
<falafel>	latest FF on linux
<Sharaal>	fiatjaf: forget tick, thats only in node.js
<pi->	Huge variation between platforms.
<GreenJello>	pi-, can you get rid of the random calls in the loops?
<inimino>	nice
<GreenJello>	or at least limit the number of times it can loop?
<pi->	GreenJello: there is no random call in the main loop.  There is only randomness Setting up the initial conditions.
<Eppiox>	how does js handle all those var in the loops? From other languages I remember you can speed things up if you var them once uptop and then null or 0 them at the start of loops
<falafel>	don't think that would make a difference here
<pi->	Eppiox: that's a good question I've been meaning to ask for a while.
<Sharaal>	Eppiox: js does this automaticly
<GreenJello>	in ff the problem is likely canvas drawing
<falafel>	I think what is slow is the while loop, it probably is looping to much causing to slow down temporarily
<inimino>	there is only function scope in JS
<falafel>	why is canvas slow in FF?
<pi->	One obvious problem with my algorithm is that it's performing typically 1+2+...+n-1 collision detections each frame. But the collision detection should still be negligible. It seems to be the rendering that kills it in FF.
<Sharaal>	pi-: if I would have this problem I would search an already available js phys engine
<GreenJello>	pi-, yeah
<GreenJello>	pi- if you want it to be fast in FF, you need webgl
<pi->	Sharaal: sure, but I'm doing it as an exercise.
<pi->	I think WebGL is the next exercise then!
<GreenJello>	maybe use something like pixijs for the rendering layer
<pi->	How do these library providers survive?  Like pixi.js.  There is so much high quality stuff out there for free.
<pi->	I guess they are advertising their expertise...
<GreenJello>	pi-, sometimes they do consulting, but usually they have a day job
<pi->	Grief! I just tested that ball page in Safari and it doesn't even show anything on the screen. Just the background! At least it gets that right!
<inimino>	at least the fps is good
<kemikal>	Hi, I'm trying to get the basic example to work from twitters typeahead.js to work but can't figure out what I'm doing wrong
<pi->	inimino: :)
<kemikal>	plase can somebody take a look and help me? http://plnkr.co/edit/rLQRz9tojwys8yTDCsCG

<dami0>	hi, can someone help me with some regex?
<dami0>	i want to do the equivalent of .replace() for a string, but only the last occurene
<dami0>	occurence*
<pi->	dami0: There is a ##regex IIRC
<fiatjaf>	thank you, Sharaal
<pi->	http://www.paulirish.com/2011/requestanimationframe-for-smart-animating/ <-- is this shim out of date now?  i.e. Unnecessary.  http://caniuse.com/requestanimationframe seems to show that requestAnimationFrame is ubiquitous, it doesn't hint that the names might be different on different browsers.
<pi->	Also, isn't that shim over complicated?  Couldn't it just be `var rAF = window.requestAnimationFrame || window.webkitRequestAnimationFrame || window.mozRequestAnimationFrame || function(callback){ window.setTimeout(callback, 1000/60); };
<vileRaisin>	the setTimeout function isn't reliable enough
<vileRaisin>	if you want to simulate RAF
<vileRaisin>	you want to make sure it is 60fps
<vileRaisin>	I believe that's why that shim is more complicated
<vileRaisin>	it is trying to accurately emulate 60fps
<Maxdamantus>	Though RAF isn't necessarily 60 fps.
<pi->	Yes, but it seems to use a completely unnecessary closure.
<Maxdamantus>	also, the setTimeout doesn't take into account whether the content is actually visible.
<Maxdamantus>	it's also not passing a timestamp to the function.
<Maxdamantus>	I wouldn't call that a shim. It shouldn't replace `requestAnimationFrame`
<vileRaisin>	polyfill, shim, not sure if it matters what you call it
<Maxdamantus>	Function that has various implementations.
<Maxdamantus>	How about that?
<vileRaisin>	I think shim in this case is used as a more generic term
<vileRaisin>	but it is definitely by definition a polyfill
<pi->	This is vexing.  I can't figure out why that http://output.jsbin.com/xaviferafi/1/ ball-bounce page fails to render in Safari.  I've tried substituting requestAnimationFrame with webkitRequestAnimationFrame but it makes no difference.
<vileRaisin>	requestanimationframe shouldn't need a prefix on safari
<pi->	Has anyone else come across difficulties rendering to Canvas on Safari?
<Nazral>	Is it possible that exactly the same code doesn't give the same result on the same browser depending if it's locally or remotely ?
<Nazral>	(no ajax, just canvas stuff)
<inimino>	Nazral: if by "locally" you mean file:// then yes
<Nazral>	yes
<Nazral>	Why would that be ?
<inimino>	security, same origin policy
<Nazral>	well, restarting the browser fixed that

<ruediger>	Are declarations in a for loop hoisted to the parent scope or limited to the scope of the for loop?  I.e., { for(var i = 0; ...; ...) { } } is this equivalent to { var i; for (i = 0; ...; ...} {} } or (similar to C99 or C++) { for (i = 0; ...; ...) { var i; } }
<vileRaisin>	IIRC they are hoisted
<ruediger>	oh ok :/ thanks vileRaisin
<vileRaisin>	a good practice is to define the variable outside the for loop, in the function scope
<ruediger>	vileRaisin: I guess so, if they are hoisted
<ankr>	ruediger hoisted - javascript doesn't have block scope.

<Nurbs>	Sorella: Going to stay with _ I guess, thanks. Namespaces with WeakMaps as used in Mozilla's look interesting, too, for some purposes.
<Sorella>	chipotles: functions are first class in JS, so they don't actually have names. Objects can have properties whose value are functions. You can store those functions anywhere else though, so `var newName = console.log`, for example, or `console.newName = console.log`. You need to account for what the `this` parameter should be in that function though
<Sorella>	!this @ chipotles
<ecmabot>	chipotles: If a function call is of the form `a.b()`, `this` will be the object you accessed the "b" property from. Otherwise, if it's of the form `a()`, `this` will be `undefined`, which is turned into the global object if the function isn't in strict mode. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/08/30/understanding-javascripts-this/

<MattPil29>	Hi, I'm looking for some advice on tooling/workflow/SCC structure for a large multi client project with heavy dojo (javascript framework) frontend and c# backend.  All currently in one git repo and developed in Visual Studio 2013.  Is this the most appropriate channel? Suggestions welcome before I shout the question...
<inimino>	!ask @ MattPil29
<ecmabot>	MattPil29: Don't ask to ask, nor if anyone is here or alive or uses something. Just ask your question. http://www.mikeash.com/getting_answers.html http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
<MattPil29>	was asking if correct Chanel - trying to be polite.
<inimino>	MattPil29: ...but you may not feel much love for Dojo around here
<MattPil29>	Dojo has been a good choice for us so far.  Question is more about tooling.  Will get on and ask then
<Sharaal>	he will not feel much love for all frameworks, cause frameworks are always bad and should not used (In my feeling thats the culture most times here) ^^
<inimino>	I'm just trying to indicate that I don't know if you'll get a response, but you are welcome to try.
<MattPil29>	We have a JS viewer which has components that plug in.  It also has a themes for clientA, ClientB etc.  Each client has different components 1, 2, 3.  At the moment this is all mashed up in one solution.  The css is built with stylus, the JS with dojo build.  I'd like to split it all up into separate git repo's. Question next...
<MattPil29>	if I have 20 repos with all the bits in, and I need a build for client A and a build for client B (then a patch for them),  How do I pull the code down into a solution to develop it and then produce my distributables.  I was thinking that each component would be built into a package and then use grunt/bower to pull them into a solution for testing.
<wast0>	hello, i can't get this working mouseover event: http://jsfiddle.net/sWfYm/45/ to work on this library https://github.com/demux/sublime-scroll , anyone have an idea of what part of sublime scroll is killing the event listener?
<MattPil29>	Kind of got myself mixed up with building packages that we use in our own solution (cyclical) and where the dev is done and where the build is done/
<inimino>	MattPil29: it's kind of a question of taste isn't it?
<cjohnson>	MattPil29: you could also use branches instead of different repos
<MattPil29>	I thought the branches would be needed for versioning so the repos make sense for each component
<cjohnson>	but honestly I'd probably use a codepath to differentiate instead of using VCS to differentiate
<cjohnson>	that way you can factor common code together
<cjohnson>	you can use branches however you like tho
<cjohnson>	splitting a common codebase into 2 repos makes it hard to keep things in sync
<inimino>	yes
<cjohnson>	at least by using branches you get "git merge" to help some of the headache
<inimino>	you can just have separate top-level files that pull in what you need
<MattPil29>	<cjohnson> yes I was looking at submodule and subtree but not finding a great deal of sucess - the team just moved from TFS to GIT and are struggling
<cjohnson>	right, that's what I have on my project. one master branch that has 2 variations of one codebase in it
<phpmiddleman>	how can i make a function pass in function when i invoke it with setTimeout? e.g. setTimeout(add, 10) // i want to pass in 2 and 3
<cjohnson>	and 2 top level files that initialize the project with different modules and a different theme for each project
<cjohnson>	phpmiddleman: .bind
<inimino>	now just add npm :)
<cjohnson>	add.bind(null, 2, 3)
<MattPil29>	<cjohnson> trying to picture that (some of the language is new to me)
<MattPil29>	<inimino> tasate seams like a luxury at the moment, I'm looking for a practical/robust approach that the team can understand and manage! suggestions welcome
<cjohnson>	my project is mostly PHP. but basically I have one index.php that starts loading all the modules, and then based on the domain I'm using, will load one of 2 bootstrapping/config files
<cjohnson>	which is where each domain's theme gets declared, and its list of modules to load
<cjohnson>	then I have a themes dir where I have domaina.com and domainb.com
<cjohnson>	and based on the config that was loaded, the views are read from one or the other
<MattPil29>	<cjohnson> thats at runtime correct?  I'm thinking how do I structure git and then use tooling to get files needed for Dev first.  Then second how do I build a specific release.  Runtime is working ok.
<cjohnson>	well for me, when I dev, I just have 2 local domains set up to mirror production
<cjohnson>	dev should generally work the same as prod
<cjohnson>	domaina.devlocal and domainb.devlocal both point to localhost and the same logic that differentiates them in prod differentiates them in dev
<cjohnson>	and yes it's at runtime, which is what I was saying I prefer for this sorto f thing. Trying to differentiate them with VCS can get very messy
<cjohnson>	it's hard to factor common code out if you're using VCS to do it
<cjohnson>	if you wanted tho, you could just use 2 different build scripts and do it that way. At deploy time instead of runtime
<cjohnson>	still codebase tho
<inimino>	right
<inimino>	two makefiles or whatever
<MattPil29>	<cjohnson> hmm kind of makes sense.  I have PHP guy who works for me , he seems to edit the code in the environment.  Whereas Visual studio edits the src and copies the files to a local environment during debugging. Maybe that isn't relevant.
<wast0>	thx for answer
<inimino>	or you can keep everything in separate repos and treat all your shared code as libraries
<cjohnson>	that's not a bad approach depending how much intermingling you have
<inimino>	but sounds like that might be a stretch
<MattPil29>	<inimino> thats what I'd like to do.  how do i pull 20 libraries into a project for r1.1 of Client B?  and at the same time get different libraries/versions for r2.1 of Client A.  whats the workflow/tools..
<rsmithlal>	hello!
<rsmithlal>	!help
<ecmabot>	rsmithlal: For help, ask your question. Be patient. Code samples should be pasted in a paste service (see !paste). Tell us 1) what you want to happen, 2) what is actually happening, and 3) any error messages you find (see !describe and !debug).
<schnarald>	!paste
<ecmabot>	schnarald: Show some code, but don't paste it on the channel. You can provide a test case we can run and help you with your problem with http://jsfiddle.net , http://jsbin.com , or http://requirebin.com . Sites like http://gist.github.com/ and http://bpaste.net are cool too.
<inimino>	MattPil29: npm, but if you're just now moving to git that might also be a stretch
<rsmithlal>	I'm trying to make a draggable div that acts as a loupe (magnifier) for an image. I'm basing it on an example that used the mouseover position to scroll the background relative to the image, but I need it to be relative to the image/zoom div corners. I ahve it working but I can't get the position formula working. can someone take a look at it and offer a solution? http://jsfiddle.net/b06be7pt/
<Sharaal>	MattPil29: inimino: depends on what libraries and how using them, npm or bower I would suggest
<Sharaal>	to get libraries
<quetzakubica>	how can I make event bus using FP?
<cjohnson>	don't use bower, just use npm
<cjohnson>	quetzakubica: EventEmitter ? node comes with it and I'm sure you can use it elsewhere
<rsmithlal>	does anyone have an idea for my issue?
<quetzakubica>	cjohnson I want to know how can I make event oriented architecture using functional paradigm
<rsmithlal>	or at least some good serach terms to use? I've been looking but most examples are magnifiers based on mouseover
<cjohnson>	right, you would use something like EventEmitter quetzakubica
<cjohnson>	make things that emit events, and thins that subscribe to them
<quetzakubica>	cjohnson but how to implement it in FP manner
<quetzakubica>	I can't have a state
<cjohnson>	it already is
<cjohnson>	how do you mean?
<cjohnson>	you would just not use any non-functional code with your events
<quetzakubica>	what I mean is in example addEventListener is appending listener to array, and that map must be preserved somewhere
<cjohnson>	right, something somewhere has to store who is listening to what
<quetzakubica>	I can keep it in closure but it looks just like a normal oop
<cjohnson>	why do you care how it stores that map?
<cjohnson>	or that it does at all
<MattPil29>	<inimino><Sharaal> thanks, are they for compiled libraraies or raw src?  would I have a package file for each client/version ?
<Sharaal>	MattPil29: npm and bower are both for javascript. javascript get not compiled, so its the source.
<MattPil29>	<Sharaal> I use compiled loosely, we go through a build process to minify and combine files.  If I built each component indiviudally then it could be either raw or built code in a package that npm retrieves for me
<Sharaal>	MattPil29: you mean minified javascript? thats another thing :) that depends on the library, I would say most offer minified and normal variant of the library
<MattPil29>	<Sharaal> agreed but I am talking about using lots of my own libraries to build a specific version of our application.
<rsmithlal>	anyone know how to scroll a draggable div's background image relative the its position over an image? I have it scrolling but it's not lined up properly http://jsfiddle.net/b06be7pt
<theshithawk>	you need to add 5
<rsmithlal>	me?
<Sharaal>	MattPil29: you can decide if you minify the libs on building the versions and offer minified variant or just minify all together in the application which use the libs
<rsmithlal>	theshithawk: were you referring to my question?
<theshithawk>	what,
<theshithawk>	oh no, sorry
<rsmithlal>	oh okay, you didn't reference anyone or speak for a while so i was unsure
<MattPil29>	<Sharaal><cjohnson><inimino> I've got to run.  Thanks for your time/advice - have a good weekend.
<rsmithlal>	MattPil29: good luck!
<theshithawk>	rsmithlal: ah no it's just what i generally do
<theshithawk>	if it is off by 5
<theshithawk>	i add 5
<theshithawk>	u know
<theshithawk>	works all the time
<rsmithlal>	how could I figure out how much it's off by? I can visually find where the edge of the div lines up with its image background edge, but not sure how to translate that to a value.. trial and error?
<theshithawk>	yes
<theshithawk>	you click everywhere you can
<theshithawk>	then you note down the offsets
<theshithawk>	then you make a hash
*	zz_robotmayo is now known as robotmayo
<theshithawk>	where you can look up the correction
<theshithawk>	or maybe in the process you might find a pattern
<theshithawk>	u know
<theshithawk>	then you could skip the rest of the clicking
<theshithawk>	and the hash
<rsmithlal>	it's complicated by having to scroll based on the ration of the large(zoomed) background image to the small display image
<theshithawk>	mostly a ratio
<theshithawk>	well it is nothing you couldn't find out by wathing some values and some basic algebra and thinking
<rsmithlal>	true

<ksmth>	take the slack iOS app as an example. it's well made, but if you slide out the sidebar … yuck
<ksmth>	it just feels wrong and irritating
<cjohnson>	harbhub: it's entirely up to your use case
<cjohnson>	native is virtually always better for the user, non-native is virtually always better for the developer
<cjohnson>	I view non-native apps as a stepping stone to get your foot in the door
<ksmth>	as a dev … well, if it's resource constraints all over, there's only one option
<ksmth>	yes
<cjohnson>	you use it at first to get the app running using your API, and then over time you can build a native app using that same API that is better for the user
<jmartinez>	I am having troubles with the responseError interceptor in AngularJS http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30033855/intercept-unathorized-api-calls-with-angular
<Sorella>	Focusing on a native app first for a single platform usually is a better idea imho
<Sorella>	But it also depends on what you're developing. It might be that the difference between native and hybrid isn't that great. Or you might find that a webapp is "good enough"
<cjohnson>	for users yeah. for your boss, they usually want something "usable" and released ASAP
<cjohnson>	and "we'll make it better later"
<cjohnson>	I've def spent a lot of wasted hours trying to perfect a project for first launch only to find out it wasn't that well liked or highly used anyway

<jackp10>	hi all
<natmyers>	pi-: don't know but it's pretty mesmerizing
<jackp10>	can someone point me to the right direction ? I am trying to get a jquery UI tooltip to appear only after x seconds the mouse is over the element
<jackp10>	the "show" option make the transition slower but does not do what I need
<jackp10>	I thought there was a delay option, but I can't find it
<pi->	natmyers: yep this must be why people watch snooker on TV
<natmyers>	jackp: looks like there's a duration option if you specify it in a property as {delay: 100} or something
<natmyers>	in the show option
<natmyers>	http://api.jqueryui.com/tooltip/#option-show
<natmyers>	sorry, delay
<rsmithlal>	jackp10: check out the timeout for the function call http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_settimeout.asp
<rsmithlal>	jackp10: so try wrapping your "on.mouseover" finction in a timeout function like in the link example
<jackp10>	ok let me try
<natmyers>	I think wrapping in a timeout will always show the popup even if you just slide over it
<natmyers>	just after the fact
<natmyers>	jackp10: sorry I missed your username up there
<rsmithlal>	hmm good point, i'm not sure how it works exactly. perhaps use a hover event and it will only activate on hover rather than passing over the element
<jackp10>	natmyers, don't worry.. I got the message.. I am trying to test both suggestions given
<jackp10>	the setTimeout doesn't seems to work, as wrapping the tooltip inside it will display the default html one and not the jquery one

<Torkable>	http://drupalmotion.com/article/debounce-and-throttle-visual-explanation
<jaawerth>	PigDude_: it's all about bundling
<jaawerth>	PigDude_: IE browserify, webpack, or jspm. Unless you're using a lazy-loading module system like SystemJS/es6-module-loader or RequireJS
<jaawerth>	but even then it's best to bundle in production to save on http requests
*	knod is now known as knod_away
<PigDude_>	right, but people have found ways to make browserify work with bower, i'm more curious about package integrity. agreed that either is workable
<PigDude_>	because previously frontend deps in npm was considered no-go, as stuff was only up-to-date in bower
<PigDude_>	maybe i missed something where package authors started publishing to npm, or maybe the world of frontend is split between deps maintained in npm and maintained in bower?
<pyCasso>	anyone here ever used this templating library https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/getting-started.html
<PigDude_>	are people just using npm because it's easy to get going w/ browserify?
<PigDude_>	the packages there do seem badly outdated
<jaawerth>	PigDude_: the packages where?
<PigDude_>	in npm ...
<jaawerth>	my perception is that people are moving away from bower
<PigDude_>	i'd hope so, but i see packages out-of-date in npm.
<jaawerth>	because once you can use browserify, there's little need for it
<PigDude_>	right, i want to get away from bower
<jaawerth>	really? do you have an example?
<jaawerth>	I find that surprising
<jaawerth>	mostly I just see some stuff that still hasn't been made CommonJS-friendly
<PigDude_>	i don't use ember but ember here is quite old https://www.npmjs.com/package/ember
<PigDude_>	i mean, reality doesn't permit circumscribing package selection to "uses commonjs" in the frontend world :\
<jaawerth>	what do you mean?
<PigDude_>	here's zepto, which has not been updated in a while either https://www.npmjs.com/package/zepto
<PigDude_>	i'm sure i could dig up a bunch more
<jaawerth>	anyway, that's part of why I like jspm

<PigDude_>	17:22 < jaawerth> mostly I just see some stuff that still hasn't been made CommonJS-friendly
<jaawerth>	PigDude_> i mean, reality doesn't permit circumscribing package selection to "uses commonjs" in the frontend world :\
<jaawerth>	"circumscribing package selection"?
<PigDude_>	being limited
<jaawerth>	ahh I see
<jaawerth>	well, it's a double-edged sword
<PigDude_>	the best kind :)
<cjohnson>	no, this is a double-edged sword: http://labs.sogeti.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sword.jpg
<jaawerth>	some stuff is out of date/poorly maintained on npm, but anecdotally it's stuff I generally don't care to use anyway (zepto and ember, bleh), while on the other hand npm gives you access to lots of powerful modules that have never even been touched on bower
<jaawerth>	also, it helps you get away from globals
<PigDude_>	right, that's why i want to switch us to browserify
<PigDude_>	ok i think i got my answer
<jaawerth>	jspm and webpack both provide abstract interfaces though, if you need to use bower sources
<PigDude_>	thanks jaawerth
<PigDude_>	i'll check out jspm
<jaawerth>	you can use npm, bower, or other arbitrary repositories
<jaawerth>	one warning about jspm: it's typically used with SystemJS, which is still a bit bleeding edge
<PigDude_>	ok i'll limit my research to webpack :)
<jaawerth>	in that you can use ANY package format with it: CommonJS, AMD, and *dundundunn* ES6
<PigDude_>	goog.provide/require? ;)
<jaawerth>	personally I love it though, and found it faster to get up and runnign than webpack

<pyCasso>	following the steps , im lost on how to render the results to the html on the page
<jeremyw>	Hello all.
<jeremyw>	I've got a style guide.  Let's say I've got a function.  Within said function I need to define some helper functions.  Typically, I use the very verbose version: var myFunc = function (myFunc) { /* ... */ };
<jeremyw>	I'm getting push back at work and I thought about just using the function declaration for simplicity.
<jeremyw>	Anyone have any opinion on the matter?
<jeremyw>	I've read a bit on this and there doesn't seem to be an official stance as I'm not using them in ways that have an impact on performance or hoisting, etc.
<Torkable>	just use the other style?
<PigDude_>	you shadow your function name with the first param??
<PigDude_>	that's a terrible style
<PigDude_>	i'm assuming you typod that example
<jeremyw>	I guess.  ;)  But at one point, not having a function name had issues with debugger.
<jeremyw>	Not an issue now.  I probably did.
<PigDude_>	ok, so you typod your example
<jeremyw>	Yeah, that was a typo.
<PigDude_>	and you meant function myFunc
<jeremyw>	Yeah.
<Torkable>	function foo() { ... }
<Torkable>	vs
<PigDude_>	so use function foo
<cjohnson>	var myFunc = function myFunc
<jeremyw>	var myFunc = function myFunc () { ... *;
<Torkable>	var foo = function() { .. }
<PigDude_>	why would you use var foo = function
<jeremyw>	That was my bad.
<PigDude_>	what does that accomplish?
<cjohnson>	it does accomplish something but every time this comes up I forget what
<cjohnson>	lol
<jeremyw>	That's what I'm asking.  I think I started doing this a long time ago to work around something.
<PigDude_>	hoisting only matters if you depend on it
<PigDude_>	just use function foo
<PigDude_>	don't use var foo = function foo because that's silly
<cjohnson>	it's about being able to recurse with the function name and not worrying about somebody else overwriting it I think
<PigDude_>	and don't use var foo = function because that will be hard to debug right
<robertmaxrees>	wat
<robertmaxrees>	woops wrong window
<jeremyw>	So let's agree that it's overkill and the reasons behind it probably don't matter anymore.  Is that fair?
<cjohnson>	but that's an edge case, if you're not recursing or your function isn't leaking into global scope, there's no benefit to useing var foo = function foo
<PigDude_>	but i can see why you'd get pushback for var foo = function foo
<cjohnson>	but if you are recursing and the function is exposed globally then yeah that's reason to use it
<jeremyw>	Same here.  I questioned it when brought up but I know I started doing that at some point for a reason.
<PigDude_>	tell them their code is not idiomatic or something, that'll keep em guessing
<jeremyw>	hahaha
<PigDude_>	or say some weird shit you're doing you saw in an ES7 proposal
<PigDude_>	that wins
<PigDude_>	future-proof!
<Torkable>	lol if someone told me they were coding to ES7 I'd tell em to stfu
<PigDude_>	you're not using traceureur?
<jeremyw>	Okay.  So I'll use "function myFunc () { ... }" and move on.  Much simpler and there isn't a need I've seen that required the other.  I did hear cjohnson on the matter, I don't think that's my case right now.
<jeremyw>	Thanks all, this is just what I needed.  I couldn't remember why I started doing that and since I couldn't remember, I figured I'd ask.  Glad to know I can remove all the bloat.

<pi->	cjohnson: ah good, Google turns up "Advanced settings -> show developer menu" -- I was starting to feel something was missing in Safari
<cjohnson>	but f() is talking about function f?
<cjohnson>	I'm lost again haha
<dami0>	blah
<theseb>	when an event invokes a javascript function does it implicitly/automatically get passed some kind of DOM event object?
<theseb>	(I hope that question makes sense)
<Falstaff_>	theseb, yes
<theseb>	Falstaff_: even if i don't explicitly pass in that object!? wow
<theseb>	Falstaff_: thanks btw
<Falstaff_>	just make your handler accept a parameter, often people use "e", and then console.log it or set a breakpoint and see what it has
<Sorella>	cjohnson: a named function expression creates an immutable binding with that name in the scope of that function expression.
<Sorella>	But a function declaration doesn't.
<Sorella>	So a function declaration is more like `var f = function(){ }`
<Sorella>	I presume this is there for self recursion
<fatbrain>	That's both a definiton and a declaration
*	fatbrain like to share
<cjohnson>	Sorella: so it has to be both named and an expression?
<cjohnson>	a simple declaration (aka a statement?) won't do it, and if it's not named there's nothing to bind
<cjohnson>	I see
<fatbrain>	cjohnson: addEventListener('click', function foo() { console.log(foo); }, true);
<Sorella>	cjohnson: yes
*	lanceball is now known as lance|afk
<cjohnson>	so in your second example, when you did f= whatever, that was actually discarded
<cjohnson>	you didn't really change
<cjohnson>	f
<Sorella>	cjohnson: yup. For some reason that binding is immutable
<fatbrain>	The binding comes from the name, not the variable you assign it to
<pi->	I think I've tracked my Safari rendering bug down to "Safari fails to handle D3 HSV colors" -- http://output.jsbin.com/zutokeyeka/1/ <-- if I change `d3.hsl( lerp(0,240,density/10), random(.3,.7), random(.3,.7) )` to `'blue'` it now renders correctly.
<cjohnson>	fatbrain: right, it's because it's an expression
<cjohnson>	in expression form, the function name is bound immutably. but in var f = function() { there is no name to bind
<cjohnson>	in death, members of project mayhem have a name
<cjohnson>	his name was rober paulsen.
<cjohnson>	+t
<fatbrain>	cjohnson: +1

<Agamemnus>	F* is going on
<Agamemnus>	now i have no div

<Agamemnus>	this doesn't make any sense!!!
<cjohnson>	works fine here

<Agamemnus>	yes i was able to replicate the jsbin
<Agamemnus>	freaking server is caching my css, making things doubleplus difficult
<cjohnson>	the flyingsoft url is the one I loaded
<cjohnson>	alert came up fine
<cjohnson>	look at your console tho, you're getting 404s
<Agamemnus>	doesn't matter
<pi->	https://jsfiddle.net/8toc9vu8/ <-- this is really testing my patience. I have no idea why using d3.hsl is failing. I have it working in a far more complex webpage.
<pi->	hm maybe it is loading order that is the problem, maybe d3 hasn't got loaded by the time that line executes, and I need to switch the order of my scripts.
<pi->	nice try pi-
<cjohnson>	open your console pi-
<cjohnson>	read the errors
<cjohnson>	fix them
<Agamemnus>	now window.addEventListener ('load', function () { won't run
<cjohnson>	Agamemnus: it works **just fine** here, as I've told you many times
<cjohnson>	using your flyingsoft url
<cjohnson>	the load fires, the touch event binds, and the touchstart fires when I touch the body
<Agamemnus>	Just try it again
<Agamemnus>	I am changing the code

<pi->	cjohnson:  gosh!  That must be why Safari was failing to display the page.  damn.
<Agamemnus>	nothing is happening now
<cjohnson>	Agamemnus: well you removed that touchstart alert line you had in the first place
<cjohnson>	now it's moved into this preservethewest function

<stalkr_>	Hi, anyone here used Backbone.Paginator before? Having trouble getting next/specific page, getting RangeError: No link found for page 2 even though I have implemented parseLinks myself. Please see https://gist.github.com/anonymous/01a8a2077c0adbf549ac -- what's weird if I do line 7 in the hack file (calling images.getPage(2) twice), it'll work fine. Leave it out and it won't. What's the reason for this?
<knod>	I'd like to use a certain color for both the color of errors and the color of the little "x" symbol for deleting. I'm trying to think of a class name, and I thought of "warning", but if I also want warnings, then warning would be yellow or orange or something. But I can't name it "error" because it's not just for errors. Any ideas?
*	17SABL1K8 is now known as jacobroufa
<deltab>	call it error and something else
<deltab>	e.g. delete-button
<zomg>	knod: you could have one called error for things that are actually errors, and then one called danger for deleting or other potentially destructive actions
*	deltab nods
<knod>	zomg: Actually, danger makes sense for the errors too!
<forQuery>	knod... there is a super simple library that let's you do log.error(whatever)  log.info()  log.warn() log.debug()  and log.trace() and it is all different colors
<forQuery>	also, you can turn all errors on or off globaly at any level.  it's only 1kb
<forQuery>	if you want to know name, i can look it up for you, it escapes the top of my mind... i use it though, has helped me a lot
<knod>	forQuery: thanks, but it's more dynamic than that. It's got red boxes and things.
<knod>	That does sound quite useful though.
<forQuery>	ohok
<forQuery>	the log.trace() does a full ordered stack trace of any method or function... is neat
<deltab>	knod: just because two things have the same color doesn't mean they're the same class
<knod>	forQuery: doesn't console.trace do the same thing?
<knod>	deltab: true
<msafi>	>> [1,2,3,4].map(function() { return Date.now() })
<ecmabot>	msafi: (object) [1431112105826, 1431112105826, 1431112105826, 1431112105826]
<forQuery>	yes but, then you are stuck with it globally in your project with you go to production
<knod>	This was going to be called 'danger-color' or something though. Specifically about the font color.
<forQuery>	with this, you can turn off all log.trace() if you dont want to see it... and use different log level
<knod>	forQuery: Oh, there's a way to disable it all centrally?
<forQuery>	yea log.setLevel("debug") will only show level debug and up, not level trace
<knod>	btw, are there stack trace things that show you more than just the functions?
<knod>	forQuery: That does sound useful.
<deltab>	knod: why do you want only one class? to minimize the css?
<knod>	deltab: to minimize the places where I have to change it if I decide to change color schemes
<fakewasabi>	Hi guys. In ES6, is there a way to destructure a function parameter and also give it a name? For example ({x: {y, z}}) - I'd like to be able to use x.
<deltab>	knod: .error-color, .danger-color { ... }
<forQuery>	https://github.com/pimterry/loglevel it's like a 5 minute learning curve too.
<knod>	deltab: *facepalm*
<knod>	Yeah, that makes much more sense
<knod>	forQuery: Thanks!
<msafi>	fakewasabi: how about { x = { y, z } }
<knod>	and thank you deltab and zomg too.
<knod>	Weird, didn't know you could use "=" inside an object
<forQuery>	i have log.trace set for every method.... so i if i want to know what is called when i click on what button... i turn in globally, click, and i see the 5-6 functions that are called... and then i say, yuck, why is function #4 called here.  and then i can fix.
<Sorella>	knod: you can't.
<forQuery>	sorella!! i read your objects article
<forQuery>	on robot lolitas
<forQuery>	it was great
<knod>	Heh, I try to read Sorella's articles. They all go way over my head.
<Sorella>	But, { x = { y, z }} isn't an object. It's a block with an assignment statement :)
<fakewasabi>	msafi - unfortunately that doesn't work.
<deltab>	fakewasabi: I don't think so; but you could use ({x}) then {y, z} = x
<fakewasabi>	deltab - yeah, that's what I'm doing now. Just wondering if there was a more concise way to do it.
<forQuery>	[?] the mario coin boxes in your article... is that just utf character encoding glitch
<forQuery>	or does that actually have purpose?
<cjohnson>	utf glitch
<cjohnson>	[[Prototype]] should be
<cjohnson>	I blame the server!
<forQuery>	yes :)
<cjohnson>	or article
<fakewasabi>	Too bad it doesn't just work... there's an identifier there already. :)
<forQuery>	knod, that's how I was 1 year ago... tried to read same article couldn't understand.  It takes a lot of reading and not understanding to finally get it to click.
<knod>	Dang, blocks? Never heard of them. I guess I'll have a lot of new stuff to learn with ES6
<ljharb>	fakewasabi: no, “destructuring” is something you do to a value you never want directly.
<ljharb>	knod: ES6 doesn’t have blocks.
<knod>	forQuery: and a lot of _doing_ too :)
<fakewasabi>	ljharb - never say never, I guess? :)
<ljharb>	fakewasabi: what i mean is, if you want the value, then you don’t want to destructure it.
<ljharb>	if you happen to want both, then that’s two separate statements :-)
<fakewasabi>	But it *could* be one statement! :D
<ljharb>	right, but mostly nobody wants that added complexity :-)
<ljharb>	two things should be two things.
<deltab>	fakewasabi: it's probably not worth the complication it would add to the syntax
<forQuery>	i think sorellas article is moer academic in nature.  in real life productoin, i dont think ppl use object.defineProperty() for example... but i could be wrong...  it's still good to know though.

<zeroquake>	Are there any advantages of using function expressions?
<Wes->	zeroquake: as opposed to ...?
<zeroquake>	function declration
<cjohnson>	hoisting
<cjohnson>	or lack thereof
<zeroquake>	declaration wins in all cases , i dont see any advantages in using expression except for prototypes.
<cjohnson>	hoisting is confusing to me
<cjohnson>	not that I don't get it
<knod>	I don't like hoisting
<cjohnson>	just that it makes it hard to understand code quickly
<knod>	Yeah
<cjohnson>	so that's one con for me
<cjohnson>	but also, you can use declaration without calling it first and that solves my only complaint with declaration
<cjohnson>	the other thing is the discussion we had earlier about how an expression will immutably bind the function's name inside the function for recursion
<cjohnson>	but that really only matters if you use both expression + declaration
<cjohnson>	which makes no sense
<inimino>	zeroquake: as arguments to HOFs expressions are sometimes convenient
<Wes->	zeroquake: you can't use function declarations to capture scope chains; declarations also pollute namespace, sometimes unnecessarily.
<zeroquake>	what do you by capturing scope chains?
<cjohnson>	works fine Wes- http://jsfiddle.net/7uw0xe22/
<cjohnson>	I don't think it pollutes namespace either
<cjohnson>	see example: http://jsfiddle.net/7uw0xe22/1/
<cjohnson>	foo2 remains inside foo
<Wes->	cjohnson: how about a less trivial case? https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8832926
<cjohnson>	same deal
<cjohnson>	it goes ito the same scope
<cjohnson>	you know for doesn't make a scope right?
<Wes->	cjohnson: can you rewrite that not use a function expression?
<Wes->	without loop unrolling
<cjohnson>	so the solution there is that you wouldn't put a for loop in global scope
<cjohnson>	so it would be fine -- it would just go into whatever scope the for loop is in
<Wes->	cjohnson: that's irrelevant
<cjohnson>	no that's entirely the point
<Wes->	cjohnson: rewrite that without using function expressions, and your output will be 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
<Wes->	look at the binding for i
<cjohnson>	right, because a for loop doesn't create a scope
<Wes->	I know that
<cjohnson>	has nothing to do with teh function
<Wes->	cjohnson: again, can you rewrite that code without using a function expression?
<cjohnson>	why are you asking me to do so?
<cjohnson>	that isn't what I was talking about
<Wes->	cjohnson: I am asking you a yes or no question
<cjohnson>	lol
<cjohnson>	go away
<Wes->	"Function expression are useless"

<tejasmanohar>	bprompt: well i mean ive used @media here and there
<tejasmanohar>	for fixes
<tejasmanohar>	not for my own sites from scratch much
<tejasmanohar>	but yeah near 0
<falafel>	well, the first hitng is even @media, without preprocessors is painful
<falafel>	at leas with sass, stylus etc, you can save your sizes in variables wohooo
<bprompt>	tejasmanohar:     btw, assuming you haven't checked, since version 33 I think firefox has a right-side-pane for media ruless under the [style editor], if any found in the file on the left-side-pane
<falafel>	tejasmanohar, also, put this in your main file before anything, rupture.use-device-width = true
<falafel>	tejasmanohar, that should be the default, but it isn't for some reason
<tejasmanohar>	holy cow jeet is good
<tejasmanohar>	oh ok ill add that falafel
<falafel>	yeah, jeet, it is so good
<falafel>	you can make any layout with it, no limit on columns, no "row" everywhere
<falafel>	and rows can have different amount of columns, all dynamic
<tejasmanohar>	this is going to save me
<tejasmanohar>	yeah
<tejasmanohar>	i think i might actually understand how to style stuff now haha

*	bprompt clicks on that link frantically, not
<cresten>	Anybody have a cookie library they like?
<zeroquake>	Any good articles on handling fixed width horizontal tables with huge number of columns?
<zeroquake>	horizontal scroll on*
<bprompt>	zeroquake:    you mean, having a "fixed" thead and a "scrollable" tbody?
<zeroquake>	scroll including thead
<zeroquake>	its DOM heavy to load like 1000 columns
<bprompt>	zeroquake:    well.. setting the table to display: block; allows overflow and thus you can set a fixed height and have it scroll
<zeroquake>	i have tried adding and removing columns as needed , but being column, jquery selectors take more time than to just recreate the whole table .
<zeroquake>	yes , am looking for a good stratergy to scroll a say 1000 column table
*	badon_ is now known as badon
<zeroquake>	if i changed to using divs instead of table, it is huge pain in aligning them.
<forQuery>	oh i have this
<forQuery>	so you have a header in your table
<forQuery>	and as you scroll down page, header stays fixed
<forQuery>	and table stays same
<forQuery>	make sure to add transform:translateZ(0) to fixed table too, to prevent repaint
<forQuery>	do you want me to send the js i used to achieve the effect?
<forQuery>	anyway, you'll have to modify it for your needs but, this will do it...
<forQuery>	http://pastie.org/10178638
<zeroquake>	yah sure ,i dont need my header fixed , but can be useful.
<renlo>	does anyone have an example of karma + jasmine?
<forQuery>	remember what i said about transform:TranslateZ(0) to fixed element
<forQuery>	or you'll have huge repaint penalty
<forQuery>	backface-visibility:hidden; or transform:translate3d(0,0,0
<forQuery>	is same thing
<zeroquake>	thank you.
<forQuery>	heres a screenshot of it in action... i use it on 9 different tables, works great on all of them..
<forQuery>	http://imgur.com/ZGzIN8Z
<zeroquake>	u still load all the rows and change its position as your scrolling right
<forQuery>	yea all rows load
<zeroquake>	where do you use transform?
<forQuery>	a clone of the head heading is created
<tejasmanohar>	falafel: do you use jade?
<zeroquake>	btw hide() and show() are horribly slow when you go up north of 50 nodes , i would recommend changing to using classes to do the same
<falafel>	tejasmanohar, I have, but I'm not using it currently
<forQuery>	transform:translateZ(0) would be added to the fixed position cloned heading... the one that is created to wrap the heading.
<falafel>	tejasmanohar, I'm using React
<tejasmanohar>	oh i see
<forQuery>	try it out, if you cant get it in a few minutes i can pull up a jsfiddle when i get back from lunch
<tejasmanohar>	react is cool, i tried a bit
<tejasmanohar>	react-native even cooler
<zeroquake>	my header is not fixed , mine is horizontal scroll
<zeroquake>	reading up on the transform property nevar used it
<forQuery>	in chrome
<forQuery>	dev tools
<Iniglo>	Do you guys know any good resources to learn how to build dynamic web applications using node and maybe sails?
<forQuery>	click the symbol at the top right hat looks like this > with three horizontal III after
<forQuery>	then, turn on paint rectangles
<annoymouse>	Hello
<foofin>	Hello!
<forQuery>	you will notice, adding transform:translateZ(0) to many elements means they will not repating on scroll
<forQuery>	such a as a fixed heading
<forQuery>	it brings you from 20fps to 80fps, with one line of css
<annoymouse>	I have a piece of HTML, but I need one part of it to be dynamic
<forQuery>	what it does, is it promotes the element to it's own layer
<forQuery>	and your GPU graphics card can handle that element
<forQuery>	you can also use will-change property and turn on/off javascript.
<annoymouse>	Basically a user uploads a file to the server, and the sever sets the <title> and an attribute on a <canvas> to the name of the file
<annoymouse>	Should I handlebars?
<zeroquake>	interesting , thanks forQuery will do some tests using that.
<annoymouse>	I'm trying to do this as efficiently as possible
<forQuery>	everything will work without transform:translateZ(0) but it can be super jank

<knod>	Are there particular reasons to use .addEventLister for not custom events? Instead of doing something like .onclick?
<tejasmanohar>	hey
<tejasmanohar>	better to set img, iframe, etc. width/height in html attributes or css selectors?
<tejasmanohar>	*css properties
<knod>	Sorry, *.addEventListener
<ljharb>	knod: tons.
<ljharb>	!onfoo @ knod
<ecmabot>	knod: Using ".onclick", ".onchange", or "on" anything is bad practice and results in poorly factored, hard-to-manage code; as well as limiting you to one event listener per event. Consider attaching your events with addEventListener, instead, eg: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener
<ljharb>	knod: primarily, 1) aEL lets you add multiple listeners. 2) onfoo listeners can be clobbered/deleted by other code, either on purpose or by accident
<Synthead>	can I use a (complex) object as a dictionary key?  As an example, a = {}; a[this] = "foo"
<ljharb>	Synthead: no, object keys are only strings (or Symbols in ES6)
<ljharb>	Synthead: but you can use anything as a key in an ES6 map
<ljharb>	!es6 shim @ Synthead
<ecmabot>	Synthead: Use https://www.npmjs.com/package/es6-shim to get every backwards-compatible feature of ES6 in every browser and node.js! It's heavily tested, comes with Promises, and requires the !es5-shim.
<Synthead>	ljharb: ok, thanks!
<ljharb>	np
<knod>	ljharb: Thanks for the specific reasons. Dang. aEL doesn't keep a list of events, thus there's no way to check if that event exists on that node, while .onfoo does leave a trail that can be followed.
<NBhosting>	whats wrong in this setup http://fiddle.jshell.net/rt2tcszj/4/
<knod>	ljharb: is it poorly factored and hard-to-manage because of the other reasons you mentioned, or are there other things that go wrong?
<ljharb>	knod: that's the primary reasons
<ljharb>	knod: that's the idea tho - you shouldn't generally need a list of handlers
<ljharb>	knod: what are you doing that you think you need that?
<ljharb>	NBhosting: what do you mean? what's supposed to happen
<NBhosting>	the brown dice shoudltn show up and u should eb able to trigger 1 with the functions
<NBhosting>	u=it
<ljharb>	NBhosting: you have 3 functions there but they're never called.
<NBhosting>	true, so no dice should showup right?
<ljharb>	no, the static html you typed in there shows up
<knod>	ljharb: I don't mean to be annoying. I don't need it for this project, but there's a bookmarklet that can show you stuff about events on a page, but only if they're added in a way that's traceable.
<knod>	I'd like this thing to be more explorable
<NBhosting>	why only the brown dice

<knod>	I'll probably need to use jQuery if I want that
<NBhosting>	i gues they on the same position then
<ljharb>	NBhosting: yes, they're position absolute. you don't likely want that.

<ljharb>	lol ah
<NBhosting>	working http://fiddle.jshell.net/rt2tcszj/17/
<ljharb>	not just 30, but *precisely* 30, down to 3 decimal places!
<jaawerth>	you go be all sensible with the metric system and then do something like that
<jaawerth>	bah
<jaawerth>	hehe
<jaawerth>	("you" being the European Union)
*	Sorella sides with Europe on this
<jaawerth>	you like the decimal?
*	Sorella changes Purr's number literals to `3.000,00`
<jaawerth>	oh god
<Sorella>	jaawerth: we use the same thing here :P
<jaawerth>	oh yeah well... *tries to think of something to mock Brazil for that isn't the last World Cup*
<jaawerth>	I got nothin'
<jaawerth>	US can't go throwing stones
<ljharb>	i actually don't understand the logic for either direction
<ljharb>	other than "it's what i'm used to, damnit" what's the reasoning to go one way over the other?
<jaawerth>	well, it's helpful to have a separator when you have that many zeros.
<jaawerth>	but the period has a mathematical significance
<Sorella>	How so?
<jaawerth>	decimals :P
<ljharb>	that's true
<ljharb>	for non-currency, everyone does `3.1` to mean 3, and 1/10
<ljharb>	(i'm questioning, why "," or "." for the separator - not that there should be a separator)
<zomg>	even in europe the separator differs
<zomg>	iirc some countries use comma, others dot :P
<ljharb>	Sorella: in europe/brazil/etc, do non-currency numbers use "," as the decimal separator?
<jaawerth>	it's tough for the the eye to parse too many adjacent zeros
<zomg>	ljharb: in finland everything uses comma as the decimal separator, I'd imagine that to be the case in any other country using it as well - regardless whether it's a currency value or not.
<Sorella>	ljharb: all numbers use "," as the decimal separator
<zomg>	eg. in the US, everything uses dot as decimal separator
<jaawerth>	ah heh I actually didn't know it was that common
<ljharb>	Sorella: ah, ok, so at least it's self-consistent.
<jaawerth>	I knew some countries did it
<jaawerth>	that changes things
<jaawerth>	I TAKE IT BACK
<ljharb>	ok so
<ljharb>	besides "familiarity" or "popularity", can anyone come up with some logic why , or . is a better decimal separator, or a better thousands separator?
<ljharb>	* also besides "ethnocentricity"
<ljharb>	assuming that whatever choice is made, everything else will be consistent with it.
<Sorella>	"," is bigger than ".", so it's easier to see it :P (or maybe not)
<jaawerth>	yeah, my main thing is just consistency
<zomg>	interesting question
<jaawerth>	if you're always using ',' for the decimal/radix then it makes perfect sense to use '.' for the separator
<zomg>	I think it's actually metric vs imperial
<ljharb>	jaawerth: and vice versa
<jaawerth>	yeah
<zomg>	metric system uses , and imperial uses .
<ljharb>	i'm asking if anyone can come up with a standalone logical argument that supports one or the other.
<ljharb>	because you *can* come up with those to support metric measurements over imperial
<zomg>	well the way I see it, at least if thinking of a number like 1.000,00
<zomg>	versus 1,000.00
<zomg>	it looks more like the , is more significant and important in that
<jaawerth>	it isn't a metric thing
<jaawerth>	I think it's a language thing
<zomg>	so in that sense it would be better in the decimal place
<ljharb>	zomg: however the "1000" is much more significant than the decimals.
<jaawerth>	right, but it's less of a big deal if you miss the separator than if you miss the decimal, I think that's what zomg is getting at
<Sorella>	ljharb: the separation in "," is more significant than the separation in "." *
<zomg>	yeah but the thousand separator has no bearing on the number itself
<ljharb>	ie, the thousands separator tells you the magnitude of the number, which varies much more widely than between the floor and the ceiling
<ljharb>	it identifies it
<jaawerth>	the thousands separator is just a signpost though
<ljharb>	right
<jaawerth>	it has no actual bearing on the value
<ljharb>	sure
<ljharb>	but when it's absent, then there's only one separator
<jaawerth>	so in that sense I can get being using a more distinct symbol for the radix
<ljharb>	so it's irrelevant which one is there
<jaawerth>	get behind*
<jaawerth>	but again, what I care about is consistency
<ljharb>	it's only when it's present. and perhaps the "," as a thousands separator more quickly conveys the magnitude of the number?
<ljharb>	jaawerth: right we already agreed consistency is important, we're past that now
<jaawerth>	and I now know (thanks wikipedia) that some countries with particularly mixed languages might go either way
<jaawerth>	that sounds maddening
<Sorella>	We could've just used spaces instead, it looks much prettier too `1 000,00`
<jaawerth>	ljharb: yeah I was just bring it around to ^
<ljharb>	Sorella: sure, unless you have multiple numbers in a row :-)
<ljharb>	1 1 000.00 234 423
<zomg>	Yeah I usually just use spaces to avoid confusion :P
<Sorella>	ljharb: 1, 1 000.00, 234 423
<jaawerth>	screw it, let's all go back to base 60
<Sorella>	(And in that case, the period works better I guess)
<Sorella>	dot, even
<jaawerth>	Sorella: out of curiosity, what language do you typically code in? most of your github stuff has been English
<Sorella>	jaawerth: just English.
<ljharb>	Sorella: ah true
<jaawerth>	I understand it can be sometimes maddening to use anything else because of how English-centric libraries tend to be, so I'm always curious about what people tend to do
<zomg>	programming in finnish at least is verbose as hell
<jaawerth>	ha! I bet
<zomg>	and the words sound super clunky
<jaawerth>	I occasionally see German code and it makes my eyes bleed
<ljharb>	finnish is one of the strangest languages on the planet
<jaawerth>	(but I am also not fluent so.. it's probably just me)
<Sorella>	Java is a perfect language to write things in German :P
<ljharb>	isn't it like the least related to other language groups?
<jaawerth>	hahaha yess
<zomg>	not sure, finnish is related to hungarian and some others at least
<Sorella>	Swedish?
<zomg>	though hungarian looks nothing like finnish so it's a bit weird that they're related
<zomg>	nah, swedish is completely different
<bprompt>	ahemm, IIRC romans wrote in all uppercase and no spaces, so..... things have changed, as they always have anyway, to improvement
<zomg>	there is a number of loan words from swedish and especially increasing amounts in spoken language in southern finland
<jaawerth>	reminds me of an old linguist joke
<ryanprior>	I'm constantly writing code with a pattern like someArray.map(function (obj) { return obj.someFunc(); }) where the only thing that changes is someArray and someFunc. Does Javascript already have a pattern that I should use to write this more simply or should I write one?
<jaawerth>	Four linguists were sharing a compartment on a train on their way to an international conference on sound symbolism. One was English, one Spanish, one French and one German. They got into a discussion on whose language was the most eloquent.
<ljharb>	ryanprior: no
<ljharb>	ryanprior: but, you can write one
<zomg>	but the relation to swedish language is mainly because finland used to be a part of sweden for quite a long time
<ljharb>	ryanprior: function invoke(fnName) { return function invokeFunction(obj) { return obj[fnName](); }; }  someArray.map(invoke('someFunc'))
<Sorella>	ryanprior: nope, but you can easily write a curried function that will call some method in some object. Like: `function invoke(method){ return function(object){ return object[method]() }}`
<jaawerth>	English linguist says, "Why, English is the most eloquent language. Take for instance the word "butterfly". Butterfly, butterfly... doesn't that word so beautifully express its delicate motion? It's like flutter-by, flutter-by."
<zomg>	there's actually one thing that's less crazy in finnish than even in english
<zomg>	pronounciation =)
<jaawerth>	Spanish linguist says, "Nice try! "Mariposa. It perfectly describes the vibrant colors on the butterfly's wings. What could be a more apt name for such a creature? Spanish is the most eloquent!"
<jaawerth>	"Papillon!" says the French linguist, "papillon! This word expresses the fragility of the butterfly's wings and body. This is the most fitting name for such a delicate and ethereal insect. French is the most eloquent language!"
<ryanprior>	ljharb, Sorella: thanks. I will write something like that. I just had a feeling that it's so common to do that, Javascript might already include something. :-)
<jaawerth>	the German linguist stands up, and demands: "Und vot is rongk mit 'SCHMETTERLING'?"
<zomg>	Mariposa just makes me think of Fallout =) the military base where they made super mutants was called Mariposa
<ljharb>	jaawerth: my favorite is http://i.stack.imgur.com/0wtlv.jpg
*	bprompt thinks jaawerth's "essay" is getting fragmented
<ljharb>	ryanprior: it's not *that* common :-)
<jaawerth>	that's it
<jaawerth>	that's the joke!
<jaawerth>	ljharb: haha, that's great
<zomg>	Perhonen <- butterfly in finnish :P
<bprompt>	jaawerth:  das gut =)
<Sorella>	ryanprior: the standard library in JS is *really* minimal
<jaawerth>	zomg: perhonen - I like that
<ryanprior>	I see that there is a spec for list comprehensions in JS, which would just let me write [obj.someFunc for obj in someArray] which is a little less verbose
<falafel>	ryanprior, the syntax is not that though, it is `[for (obj in someArray) obj.someFunc()]`
<falafel>	but I prefer the other way around tbh
*	robotmayo is now known as zz_robotmayo
<falafel>	*obj.soneFunc
<ryanprior>	falafel: ah yeah either way is fine for me, I think the way I wrote is maybe more like Python's?
<falafel>	yea
<ryanprior>	can't beat Scheme's way though: (map .someFunc someArray)
<falafel>	ryanprior, somArray.map(o => o.someFunc)
<falafel>	that's pretty close
<run00>	smack her in fanny innit
<run00>	whoops wrong chan
<ryanprior>	falafel: yeah, that's close. haskell-ish?
<Sorella>	ES won't have array comprehensions! It'll have comprehensions in the same way Scala has them (desugared to iterators + flatmap/etc)
<ljharb>	ryanprior: comprehensions in JS aren't happening.
<falafel>	which is fine Sorella
<falafel>	flatMap should come default in JS
<Sorella>	I'd call it "better" :3
<Sorella>	Yeah, they're probably going to add flatMap in the next iteration
<ljharb>	falafel: there's been discussion about es7 flatmap
*	Sorella still prefer's Purr/Mermaid's `some-array map: _ some-func`
<ryanprior>	javascript could get really nice syntax for this if functions on objects had something like .call which turned, say, String.toLowerCase() into a function (string) { return string.toLowerCase(); }
<checkit>	Hey guys... Quick security question. I have to use a particular API for a project which requires credentials be passed to it via it's init method. These are set in cleartext when init is called unfortunately. Is there a better practice in this case where I have no control over the API?
<falafel>	do(function*(){var a = yield [1,2]; var b = yield[3,4]; return a + b}) // [4,5,5,6]
<ryanprior>	then you could just write someArray.map(String.toLowerCase.call)
<jaawerth>	I prefer mapcat ;-)
<ljharb>	checkit: can only guys answer?
<ljharb>	checkit: what do you mean "cleartext" and "init method" - is this a java question by chance?
<Maxdamantus>	I prefer joinMap
<Sorella>	ryanprior: Function.call.bind(String.toLowerCase)
<ljharb>	falafel: invoke it and pass it to Array.from instead
<falafel>	String.prototype.*
<Sorella>	>> ["FOO", "BAR", "BAZ"].map(Function.call.bind(String.prototype.toLowerCase))
<ecmabot>	Sorella: (object) ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
<ljharb>	^
<Maxdamantus>	imo functions should have map and flatMap/whatever too.
<ryanprior>	Sorella: yeah, that works but it's totally unreadable IMO
<falafel>	ryanprior, abstract it into a function
<jaawerth>	just give everything an iterator and you can flatmap over that
<ljharb>	Maxdamantus: what would Function.prototype.map do?
<jaawerth>	that makes more sense to me
<checkit>	ljharb: Lol... of course not. Checkout this simple paste: http://jsfiddle.net/tdk5tauu/
<Sorella>	ryanprior: var methodize = Function.call.bind.bind(Function.call); methodize(String.prototype.toLowerCase)
<ljharb>	ryanprior: var toLowerCase = Function.call.bind(String.prototype.toLowerCase)
<ljharb>	checkit: "clear text" only matters over the wire, which it won't be if it's https

<Agamemnus>	requestAnimationFrame is skipping frames
<jaawerth>	that big screen is slowing it down ;-)
<Agamemnus>	nope
<falafel>	Sorella, it is, I'm guessing something is getting stringified
<jaawerth>	I'm kidding
<Agamemnus>	:(
<jaawerth>	that is strange though
<jaawerth>	what browser is it running? does it happen in every browser?
<Agamemnus>	i am not going to switch to pixi again
<ljharb>	Agamemnus: rAF will request frames at the speed of the device.
<Agamemnus>	chrome beta on android
<jaawerth>	(I realize they mostly all use the same engine regardless)
<Sorella>	falafel: yeah, might be
<jaawerth>	(but it might be worth trying another one)
<ljharb>	if it's not going faster, then it can't, without draining the battery or slowing it down.
<ryanprior>	thanks again for all the suggestions folks
<Agamemnus>	ljharb: I know that is what it should but it just isn't
<jaawerth>	that's true, have you tried disabling power management?
<Agamemnus>	i am thinking maybe the gifs are doing it
<ljharb>	likely
<Agamemnus>	there is very little happening here, ljharb
<Agamemnus>	i think it is yet another freaking bug
<jaawerth>	I don't know about mobile but Chrome does have some notorious GIF issues
<jaawerth>	(Notorious GIF - worst coverband ever)
<Agamemnus>	it is more or less okay with settimeout

<ljharb>	Maxdamantus: Function.prototype.map = function (fn) { var thisFn = this; return function () { return fn(thisFn.apply(this, arguments)); }; }; or something?
<Maxdamantus>	ljharb: yes.
<Maxdamantus>	ljharb: alternatively, Function.prototype.map = function(fn){ return this.flatMap(consta(fn)); }; if .flatMap/.joinMap/whatever is already there.
<Maxdamantus>	er, that's not right.
<Maxdamantus>	Function.prototype.map = function(fn){ return this.flatMap(function(v){ return consta(fn(v)); }); };
<Maxdamantus>	probably easier defining .flatMap in terms of .map
<sla_erick>	Hello, does anyone knows what is the correct/best way to execute shell commands from node.js?
<Sorella>	sla_erick: might want to ask in #node.js
<sla_erick>	Sorella, cool! I'll ask there, thanks :)
<Maxdamantus>	Function.prototype.flatMap = function(fn){ var that = this; return function(){ return this.map(fn).apply(null, arguments).apply(null, arguments); }; }
<Maxdamantus>	er, the second `this` should've been `that`
<ljharb>	i'm still not clear on what flatMap does - map is basically "compose"
<jaawerth>	kidding aside, I DO feel like mapcat makes more sense than flatMap as the general case
<jaawerth>	in other languages doesn't flatMap sometimes do things a little differently?
<Maxdamantus>	jaawerth: "cat" is fairly specific to arrays.
<jaawerth>	Maxdamantus: tell that to transducers!
<Maxdamantus>	jaawerth: flatMap is a monadic operation.
<checkit>	ljharb: Correct. What I am referring to however, are the credentials being present there in the source. Does that make sense?
<jaawerth>	Maxdamantus: I guess you're right, mapcat generally speaking expects something that will result in some sort of collection - something that has an end to it
<Maxdamantus>	jaawerth: particularly, something you can concatenate.
<jaawerth>	except the two functions in many situations end up effectively doing the same thing
<Maxdamantus>	jaawerth: you could have the operation for sets, but you don't talk about concatenating sets.
<ljharb>	checkit: sure. but if it's running in the browser, how could you possibly hide them?
<falafel>	you can sequence a series of flatmaps into something concatable
<forQuery>	for symantic naming...
*	MichD is now known as michd
<deltab>	map is one-to-one, whereas flatMap is one-to-any?
<ljharb>	checkit: there's literally no way to hide that from the browser, unless you proxy everything through your own server.
<jaawerth>	yeah, you can concatenate anything
<forQuery>	.btn-run is bad name and #codeEditor_runPHPinPreview_BUTTON is good name?
<jaawerth>	it's just that may not always be a meaningful operation
<Maxdamantus>	deltab: no.
<deltab>	what's the name for that then?
<Maxdamantus>	deltab: flatMap is map then join.
<Maxdamantus>	a.flatMap(b) = a.map(b).join()
<ljharb>	ok so what's Function.prototype.join do
<deltab>	b can return an array of any length, and they're all concatenated?
<Maxdamantus>	Function.prototype.join = function(){ var that = this; return function(){ return that.apply(null, arguments).apply(null, arguments); }; };
<jaawerth>	but when you get into the world of monads, isn't a concat and a join effectively the same operation?
<falafel>	jaawerth, join is more like flatten
<ljharb>	Maxdamantus: ok so "join" invokes immediately
<Sorella>	jaawerth: for most collections, yes. For maybe, either, etc; no.
<ljharb>	the problem i see is that `a.b.join()` will lose the "a"
<boogieidm_>	Just started learning JS today. Anyone want to answer a simple question for me?
<Maxdamantus>	Array.prototype.join = function(){ return [].concat.apply([], this); };
<Sorella>	Like, `maybe(x).concat(y)` will usually be `x.concat(y)`
<jaawerth>	Sorella: hmm I see what you mean
<deltab>	boogieidm_: what is it?
<boogieidm_>	Wtf am I doing wrong here? http://paste.ubuntu.com/11033066/
<Maxdamantus>	ljharb: what's `a.b.join()`?
<jaawerth>	so, speaking in terms of iterators for a moment
<selite>	how does equity affect compensation?
<deltab>	boogieidm_: "myCountry" is the literal string myCountry
<Maxdamantus>	ljharb: for functions, a.join()(v) = a(v)(v)

<djcjrjcj>	cjohnson: the server is in the eastern time zone
<djcjrjcj>	the engine*

<djcjrjcj>	doens’t matter current time
<cjohnson>	the timezone isn't my concern
<djcjrjcj>	you only specified date
<djcjrjcj>	the timezone is the answer
<cjohnson>	the timezone doesn't explain where it arrived at the time
<djcjrjcj>	the arguments you passed told the JS engine to create a new date at midnight on may 9th 2015
<cjohnson>	ok so it's midnight, and then TZ applied to that
<djcjrjcj>	correct
<cjohnson>	midnight is the key I was curious about

<ecmabot>	djcjrjcj: (object) Tue Jun 09 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (EDT)
<cjohnson>	'2015-05-09' would return true, '2015-05-08' and '2015-05-07' would return false

<cjohnson>	yeah?
<djcjrjcj>	cjohnson: can you assume that the date is in a predictable format?
<cjohnson>	without writing a parser myself of course
<cjohnson>	I'd rather not, is the thing
<cjohnson>	but saying I could, how would you do it
<djcjrjcj>	momentjs is pretty heavy
<djcjrjcj>	excellent lib, but heavy
<robdubya>	just use moment. it should really be the stdlib
<cjohnson>	yeah I'd rather not load it if I can get away with a 3 liner or something
<djcjrjcj>	if you knew it was always going to be yyyy-mm-dd
<robdubya>	i'm all about keeping things light, but dates are just shit in JS

<cjohnson>	and then + 60 * 60 * 1000 * 24
<cjohnson>	and then you can just < them
<djcjrjcj>	you could use apply, not sure you need to though

<boogieidm>	Yeah, it should have been "yes"
<deltab>	right

<boogieidm>	ty
<boogieidm>	javascript seems not too bad. Its just the little things that slow me down
<boogieidm>	Probably like that for everyone
<deltab>	boogieidm: computers are very, very literal about things :-)
<boogieidm>	I'm definitely finding that out.
<djcjrjcj>	deltab: js is the least literal of the mainstream languages
<djcjrjcj>	which many of my classically trained colleagues find to be the problem
*	deltab nods
<robdubya>	the dynamicness of JS is both its greatest strength and its biggest weakness
<djcjrjcj>	robdubya: when the light bulb goes off though.. watch out. that classical programmer is going to deliver like ten features in the next two days
<djcjrjcj>	with a bunch of function MyConstructor() { var self = this; } everywher
<robdubya>	heh
<Sorella>	TBF, JS could be more dynamic.
<Sorella>	Something like Clojure, Self, or even Smalltalk would be better imho
<djcjrjcj>	sorella: examples of language features that those languages have an JS doesn’t?
<djcjrjcj>	not saying you’re wrong, just curious, bc i don’t have experience in any of those languages
<Sorella>	djcjrjcj: Clojure has macros and dynamic scoping, Self has multiple delegation and no magical objects, Smalltalk is all about dynamic programming (reflection, extremely late binding, everything can be done with objects and messages (which makes OOP really natural))
<djcjrjcj>	sorella: js doesn’t have dynamic scoping?
<djcjrjcj>	re: smalltalk and reflection, i can see that argument.
<djcjrjcj>	have used reflection in PHP/Java to great benefit. although i’d say inherent polymorphism/lack of opinion on function params kind of gives JS the same ability
<Sorella>	djcjrjcj: no. JS has only lexical scoping.
<Sorella>	djcjrjcj: dynamic scoping means that if I do: `function foo(){ var a = 1; return bar() }; function bar(){ return a + 1 }; foo()` I'll get 2
<cjohnson>	that seems crazy
<cjohnson>	unless you can stll do var a in bar and get its own a that doesn't conflict with foo?
<cjohnson>	I guess that makes sense. I retract my statement
<Sorella>	i.e.: `a` isn't bound to the region it was defined, but the call path. It's a rather neat feature, but also quite dangerous, which is why Clojure requires you to be quite explicit with them, so you need `(def ^:dynamic *foo*)` and then `(binding [*foo* bar] "*foo* will be bar in all calls originating from here")`
<djcjrjcj>	sorella: `var a = 1; function foo() { return bar(); } function bar() { return a+1; }`
<Sorella>	You also can't use prefix/suffix * for variables that aren't dynamic
<djcjrjcj>	/ `foo()`
<Sorella>	djcjrjcj: that's a lexical variable.
<djcjrjcj>	yes
<djcjrjcj>	but what about `.call()`, `apply()`, `bind()`
<Sorella>	djcjrjcj: it doesn't cover the same use cases a dynamically-scoped variable covers :)
<Sorella>	djcjrjcj: that's just for passing arguments to functions
<djcjrjcj>	also setting the `this`
<djcjrjcj>	which is the key aspect i’d use in an argument for JS having dynamic scoping capabilities
<Sorella>	djcjrjcj: JS doesn't have dynamic scoping capabilities, and you can't provide it.
<Sorella>	It's just not possible
<rcyr>	Sorella: I know that's another story... but I think that dynamic scoping is so ugly that I wouldn't want it in any language.
<cjohnson>	this is a special variable, but you can't use .call or .apply to pass in var a in the examples above
<djcjrjcj>	arguments.callee could also play into this discussion
<Sorella>	(Some people would say that that's a good thing, because dependencies should be explicit)
<djcjrjcj>	and it might be telling that it was done away with
<cjohnson>	arguments.callee is another thing that isn't related to scope
<cjohnson>	well, sorta
<Sorella>	rcyr: I'm conflicted about it. It makes sense for some things, like `try/catch`
<Sorella>	rcyr: but also things like output redirection and configuration. Sure you can always write it in a different way, but they're kinda practical in some really restricted cases
<djcjrjcj>	sorella: good luck to the person maintaining it
<rcyr>	Sorella: Right
<Sorella>	djcjrjcj: not really hard if you use it in a restricted manner. We work on quite a few Clojure codebases at work
<djcjrjcj>	cjohnson: you cant use call/apply to pass in var a above?
<djcjrjcj>	sorella: i’m just playing devil’s advocate
<djcjrjcj>	all language features are great in certain use cases
<djcjrjcj>	the question is which ones are most often abused
<Sorella>	And Clojure itself uses it for some things, like output redirection. So you can do `(with-out-str (println "foo"))`, and instead of having that go to the standard output, it'll print it to a String, and return that string.
<djcjrjcj>	and whether that abuse outweighs the benefit

<RonRichie>	hey there:)
<RonRichie>	Sorella im sorry for highlighting you, but I'd like to ask something directly to you, please if you are available or whenever you get back respond me if you wouldn't mind, I've a question regarding your yesterday's explanation of callbacks and my question has to do with your very own example, thanks :)
<Sorella>	RonRichie: sure, ask away
<djcjrjcj>	sorella: put that in some coffee and have yourself a grand ol’ time
<djcjrjcj>	please ask in chat, would like to read the thread
<RonRichie>	Sorella nice, thanks a lot:) this was your example from yesterday's explanation, obviously it works... but I can't tell how it works? https://jsfiddle.net/6sbx8sta/ i dont get what happens there? is there a way to understand it better? thanks again
<falafel>	RonRichie, do the substitution
<falafel>	RonRichie, substitute `f(x)`
<djcjrjcj>	sorella: did you do logo for Purr?
<Sorella>	djcjrjcj: yeah. Though I should redraw it because it looks kinda weird there.
<falafel>	f(x) === inc(x) === function(a){return a + 1}(x)
<falafel>	RonRichie, ^
<Sorella>	(I have to avoid drinking too much coffee, but I'm baking Baileys cupcakes this weekend ♥)
<RonRichie>	falafel well, I just really need to know how this works, I know that result is correct, but I need to understand how the whole thing works
<falafel>	RonRichie, how what works? not sure what you mean...
<falafel>	RonRichie, what is the confusion?
<RonRichie>	I mean this whole passing the function situation in this example, specificly I was gonna ask about f(x) but you just answered it, so it makes more sense now, let me figure out how to word my thoughts better so I can ask precise question to get a precise answer:)
<Havvy>	RonRichie:  When you do `var f = function (x) { return x + 1; }; var a = 5; f(a);`, the first argument to `f` in `f(a)` gets aliased as the `x` in the definition, right?
<RonRichie>	so return f(x) === inc(x) === function(a){return a + 1}(x) ?
<falafel>	yeah

<javascript074>	I am using datatables.  Every row in my table has a delete button.  I have written the following javascript (http://pastebin.com/n17kiV86) but have no idea how to get the id of the row... Any help?
<javascript074>	Sorry but it is a newbie question.  Completely stumped as to how I should be calling the delete method with dataTables  .. this is my code but how do I delete?  http://pastebin.com/n17kiV86  Should I send some URL like http://localhost:8000/admin/DeleteData.php?id=1 and have a delete button on every row?
<mwizard>	guys, how does one get local-scoped variable by name, like you can `locals()['foobar']` in Python?
<Havvy>	mwizard:  You don't.
<mwizard>	javascript074: you maybe should ask in #jquery channel, as your question seems to be specific to $.dataTable()
<Havvy>	mwizard:  What are you trying to do?
<mwizard>	Havvy: extend my knowledge of JS possibilities :)
<Havvy>	Ah.
<mwizard>	you can with `var local = eval('foobar')`, but that's hell ugly and incurs compilation call cost, as well as being unsecure
<javascript074>	mwizard oops, didnt realize that channel existed. Will do!
<Havvy>	mwizard:  If for some reason you wanted to dynamically choose which local variable to use based on name, you'd place them into an object.
<mwizard>	Havvy: yep, I know that - I'm just being curious if there is some kind of "frame" object you can access that has locals already organized for you
<Havvy>	There is not.
<mwizard>	sadly. Maybe in ES8-9?..
<mwizard>	:)
<asik>	i have no idear why that should be useful
<Havvy>	I'd rather go with there being no legitimate purpose for that functionality.
<mwizard>	well... introspection maybe? self-modifying code?

<okdamn>	Hi there is anybody good on this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30138309/nodejs-socket-io-allowing-only-jwt-verified-connections
<Pessimist>	disgusting code
<humanoyd>	Is it a good idea to fake types (a la haskell) with uuids?
*	Wiched is now known as asdasdgaasasd
<Maxdamantus>	humanoyd: why UUIDs?
<Maxdamantus>	humanoyd: and what about Haskell would you be faking?
<Maxdamantus>	Except where type classes are involved, static types can be ignored in Haskell.
<humanoyd>	Maxdamantus: I'm thinking e.g. about react flux: there you have action types which are simply strings...which makes comparing them very fragile as they are not guaranteed to be unique..
<humanoyd>	e.g. for a counter in haskell you would have `data Action = Increment | Decrement`...in javascript `actions = {increment : "INCREMENT", decrement : "DECREMENT"}`
<Maxdamantus>	You can also do something like this: https://github.com/Maxdamantus/recplay/blob/master/util/quadTree.js#L6
<Alex11223>	When user uploads a file to my server (image) and then I display it in <img src="...", is there any posibility for XSS or smth like that? Such as if user uploads a js file instead of image
<humanoyd>	Maxdamantus: I don't quite see how that solves the problem :/ ...btw: nice city you live in!
<Maxdamantus>	humanoyd: what's the actual problem? uniqueness?
<humanoyd>	yeah
<Maxdamantus>	In Haskell you don't need have a concept of identifying things as having a particular type.
<Maxdamantus>	The only differentiation you have is between a finite number of "tags" in a sum type.
<humanoyd>	The thing is that I can confidently pattern match on those types: `case action of INCREMENT...`
<Maxdamantus>	With the thing I linked to, you do: action({ increment: function(){ .. }, .. })
<Maxdamantus>	which solves an issue with global variables etc, if that's what you were thinking of.
<humanoyd>	I'm mainly concerned about importing the action types into other parts of the program...a ala `import Action (..)` in haskell
<Maxdamantus>	You should only need to import it when you're using the constructor.
<Maxdamantus>	or constructors.
<Maxdamantus>	Otherwise it's just data. Type identification is a bit silly.
<Maxdamantus>	Type identification is what you do when you're relying on dynamic types.
<Maxdamantus>	if(a instanceof Triangle){ .. }else if(a instanceof Circle){ .. } etc
*	idafyaid is now known as Guest23901
<Maxdamantus>	on a related note, I'm fairly confident now that === and !== are a bit silly too.
<humanoyd>	why?
<Pessimist>	== has weird type conversion rules and might not yield what you want
<Maxdamantus>	Because they change it so instead of getting one incorrect value, you get another incorrect value.
<Maxdamantus>	true and false should both be incorrect if you're comparing things that conceptually have different types.
<humanoyd>	Maxdamantus: Can you give an example where === or !== don't work as expected?
<Maxdamantus>	humanoyd: can you give an example where === or !== work as expected but == or != don't?
<Maxdamantus>	The main case I can see for it is assertions.
<Maxdamantus>	The only reason === and !== would have preferable behaviour is because it's easier to describe.
<Maxdamantus>	so you'd ultimately have a slightly simpler language, though the behaviour doesn't replace == and !=, so it just makes it a slightly more complicated language.
<Crucials>	yeah i probably could Maxdamantus
<Gilgameshkun>	I only ever use == and != anymore as == null or != null, to simultaneously test for both null and undefined.
<Maxdamantus>	Do you ever use === or !=== where you can't use == or !=?
<Maxdamantus>	(except in assertions)
<Maxdamantus>	er, !==*
<humanoyd>	Maxdamantus: The problem is that == isn't transitive
*	dust--_ is now known as dust--
<Maxdamantus>	humanoyd: it is if the three operands are the same type.
<Maxdamantus>	humanoyd: if they're not, your code is probably bad.
<Pessimist>	Maxdamantus: http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.9.3 tell me this is easy to have in your head :)
<Maxdamantus>	humanoyd: and using === instead of == doesn't actually tell you that your code is bad.
<Maxdamantus>	Pessimist: yes. As I said before, I'd rather == had the semantics of === for the sake of simplicity of the language.
<Maxdamantus>	Though imo both are undesirable.
<Pessimist>	how is that 10 point list simple?
<Maxdamantus>	Pessimist: where did I say it was simple?
<Maxdamantus>	I've indicated that == is more complicated than ===, but the distinction between the two is only relevant in bad code.
<Maxdamantus>	and the distinction doesn't indicate that the code is actually bad.
<Maxdamantus>	so in both cases you're just making incorrect decisions when the code is bad.
<humanoyd>	Maxdamantus: Then why does it work at all on different types?
<Maxdamantus>	humanoyd: why does what work at all?
<humanoyd>	If the language allows it, it should have the correct mathematical behaviour
<humanoyd>	using == on different types
<Maxdamantus>	"correct mathematical behaviour" isn't exactly clear.
<humanoyd>	Maxdamantus: Mathematically, equality includes transitivity
<Maxdamantus>	If you follow something like Russell's type theory as the basis for mathematics, you wouldn't be able to denote comparison between things of different types.
<Maxdamantus>	If you follow ZF set theory, maybe.
<humanoyd>	which is kind of the most widely used, yes
<ksmth>	hey people
<Maxdamantus>	humanoyd: which one?
<humanoyd>	zermelo fraenkel
<ksmth>	anyone familiar with the ES7 decorator proposal here?
<Maxdamantus>	humanoyd: it'd still be dubious to denote the comparison.
<humanoyd>	then javascript should throw an error
<Maxdamantus>	humanoyd: mathematics is also usually done today under an assumption of some sort of constructive logic, rather than a bivalent logic like ES implements.
<Maxdamantus>	humanoyd: yes. That would be preferrable to both semantics.
<Maxdamantus>	if === threw an error, I'd support it.
<nexium>	Hey, I'm looking for a very simple framework to do this: http://pastebin.com/GpLxi5Sd
<ksmth>	nexium: what do you mean by framework?
<nexium>	ksmth: Code that solves this problem so I don't have to reinvent the wheel  :p
<ksmth>	nexium: that's a very broad description. you can solve that with any event based / pub/sub system

<nexium>	ksmth: I guess so. Any recommendations ?
<ksmth>	without understanding what you want, there are no recommendations :)
<ksmth>	do you want a game engine? a ui framework? an event bus? it's really not clear what you're looking for
<ksmth>	it could be as easy as … game.on('message', function (message) { view.render(message) } );
<nexium>	ksmth:  Yeah, sorry.  I'm not exactly sure what i want tbh :p i think a event pub/sub lib , that does only that.
<nexium>	just want the backend of my game to send messages saying what is happening, and user interface listening to all that.
<nexium>	its not a game in a traditional sense: http://nexiuhm.appspot.com/

<siddharth030>	ya
<dav1d>	ksmth: ah it's perfect, thank you!
<siddharth030>	it doesnot works
<siddharth030>	it just runs and runs and runs
<ksmth>	what does it log?
<siddharth030>	i mean it displays nothing
<siddharth030>	there is no log
<ksmth>	well, there you have it ...
<siddharth030>	there was nothing i printed
<ksmth>	if there's no log, then the success isn't fired
<ksmth>	either you get a 404
<siddharth030>	no it shows the alert box
<ksmth>	well, then there must also be something logged
<uskerine>	I would really grateful if someone could had a quick look to this regex, I am not sure if I can use like that spaces and the '-' sign
<uskerine>	http://pastebin.com/xVg2ck9g
<siddharth030>	something is logged when i print something
<uskerine>	same for ':'
<ksmth>	uskerine: you require spaes to be inbetween?
<uskerine>	yeah, I am matching against the below date format
<uskerine>	which includes spaces
<uskerine>	it must be an exact match of that format
<ksmth>	then you need \s
<uskerine>	so instead of " " I should use \s
<ksmth>	well, but that regex is flawed
<uskerine>	what about ':' and '-' ?
<ksmth>	99/99/9999 is valid
<ksmth>	I can't recommend momentjs enough for working with dates ;)
<uskerine>	uhm you are right
<siddharth030>	people plz help me i can read content from txt file but cannot compare it and do something
<ksmth>	siddharth030: what does console.log(result) put in your console?
<siddharth030>	man i dont need it
<ksmth>	you don't need what?
<siddharth030>	what i am doing is to display something when text file has yes in it
<uskerine>	http://pastebin.com/jG6u1Cr1
<siddharth030>	i display things with alert
<uskerine>	assuming that we accept that user can insert 99/99/9999
<uskerine>	would the latest regex be fine?
<siddharth030>	alert is working fine problem is that when i get data then i cannot compare it
<uskerine>	and how could it be done to say [01-31]
<uskerine>	?
<ksmth>	it's very obvious what you're trying to do. you're not very helpful in trying to debug
<siddharth030>	ksmth:its very very clear you can download file and just run it  on browser
<siddharth030>	nothing very difficult but i cannot compare contents of file
<siddharth030>	so that  i can stop timer
<ksmth>	siddharth030: without knowing what the contents of `result` is, nobody will be able to help you
<siddharth030>	stats.txt is the file  which contains only yes or no
<siddharth030>	my code just reads this and if yes stop timer which checks file contents
<ksmth>	yes. it's also clear, that that's not what comes through in 'result', otherwise your timeout would be canceled
<ksmth>	apparently it doesn't, or you wouldn't be herer
<siddharth030>	in result yes and no comes fine
<ksmth>	is it with a linebreak at the end, maybe?
<ksmth>	\n
<siddharth030>	ksmth:i ran alert and it showws yes and no fine
<siddharth030>	without linebreak
<siddharth030>	without linebreak
<ksmth>	insert a debugger; statement in line 11 and inspect the variable
<siddharth030>	i did that it shows me the correct value
<siddharth030>	ksmth:at 11th line i put alert(result)
<siddharth030>	it works fine
<ksmth>	oh boy … then you didn't do what I just said
<ksmth>	good luck
<siddharth030>	ksmth: i put alert in 11th line it shows me right value in notepad
<siddharth030>	i cannot just compare that value what to do
<ksmth>	is 'alert(result);' == 'debugger;' ?
<ksmth>	try it, my friend. :) it's magical. if you have the devtools open, it will teleport you right where you need to be
<siddharth030>	alert shoes me value which is changing in notepad that means value is read fine
<siddharth030>	ksmth:problem solved i used integer instead of yes or no
<ksmth>	haha, yes. it shows you it's changing, but nothing else. anyway, I'm happy you found a solution that works for you
<siddharth030>	actually problem was string
<siddharth030>	when i put integer it works fine
<ksmth>	you'll never know what really was the problem :)
<siddharth030>	then tell me
<ksmth>	it'd work, if your data was correct, see this: https://jsfiddle.net/ksmth/qL46e0s7/1/
<ksmth>	now if you would've inspected the variable, I'm sure you would've found something. either the length would be off, a whitespace at the beginning or the end, or a newline
<ksmth>	but you're not going to believe me and insist that alert() is the most awesome debugging tool
<siddharth030>	ksmth:what was the problem
<ksmth>	I just said what I believe might have been the problems for you
<ksmth>	whitespace, linebreaks
<siddharth030>	ok
<siddharth030>	but sometimes timer thing sucks too it has happened with me
<siddharth030>	ksmth : thankx for help bye

<Guest98663>	hello all guys someone use dgeni as documentation tool? I'm riyng to use it but it's without doc and it's not easy to understand
<fo_constant>	Hi anyone here interested in algorithsm?
<Gilgameshkun>	I developed a new colorspace.
<Gilgameshkun>	I mean, once.
<Gilgameshkun>	That's an algorithm, right?
<inimino>	Algorithms in a programming channel? Perish the thought.
<lalaland1125>	Do_constant, what do mean by "algorithms"
<Gilgameshkun>	I call it HSY - hue, saturation and luma.  It combines components of the HSL and YUV colorspaces.  Converting RGB to HSY is trivial, but converting HSY to RGB can be tricky/expensive. :3
<fo_constant>	lalaland1125: here is my implementation of mergesort on linked list https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e52154e6c4620882c6af and here is my doubly linked list implementation https://gist.github.com/anonymous/02e514785931d239bb28 . I am getting undefiend as my output :p
<fo_constant>	and all ^
<Guest98663>	hello all guys someone use dgeni as documentation tool? I'm riyng to use it but it's without doc and it's not easy to understand
<inimino>	The Y stands for luma?
<inimino>	Guest98663: A documentation tool without documentation?
<Guest98663>	inimino: exactly
<inimino>	Guest98663: That sounds like ... a bad sign.
<Gilgameshkun>	I designed to HSY to help me more accurately reconstruct the hues of the Game Boy Classic Display, which range from yellowish in the light range to tealish in the dark range with green in the little, but with a fairly consistent slope of change in saturation.
<inimino>	Choose another, perhaps any other?
<Guest98663>	inimino: and it's used by angular, ionic, material
<inimino>	Guest98663: you lost me around "angul-"
<Gilgameshkun>	I'm really proud of my algorithm. :3 --> http://www.furaffinity.net/full/14557792/  (Yes, it's a furry site.  Shut up. XD It's where I publish my all music, my new software, etc.)
<Guest98663>	inimino: is just an example to your reply....is a bad sign
<Gilgameshkun>	*all my music
<serses>	furry X_x
<Gilgameshkun>	If I can show it to my dad, I can show it to random people. :3
*	Z51B3 is now known as AR45
<Gilgameshkun>	It documents how the HSY algorithm works. :3
<Gilgameshkun>	I've found HSY so useful since, I've reused it in other projects.
<inimino>	Guest98663: Yeah, for my taste being used by Angular is probably more of a negative than positive signal.
<serses>	what is HSY?
<Gilgameshkun>	An algorithm I designed.  It's a colorspace and the means to convert it to and from RGB.
<inimino>	Hue, saturation and ...?
<Gilgameshkun>	Luma
<Gilgameshkun>	As in YUV's luma.
<Gilgameshkun>	A true representation of the light value of a color.
<Gilgameshkun>	YUV's luma is extremely useful for that, and HSL's hue and saturation are themselves extremely useful.
<Gilgameshkun>	Like I said, it's trivial to convert RGB to YUV.  It's trickier to convert YUV to RGB.
<Gilgameshkun>	err...
<Gilgameshkun>	Brainfarted.
<Gilgameshkun>	Like I said, it's trivial to convert RGB to HSY.  It's trickier to convert HSY to RGB.
<Gilgameshkun>	There. :3
<Gilgameshkun>	But I got it working smoothly in JavaScript.
<Gilgameshkun>	Well, first in Java, and then in JavaScript.
<Gilgameshkun>	I'd been trying for *years* to simulate accurate Game Boy Classic greyscale.
<Gilgameshkun>	See, the Game Boy Classic didn't just have four static hues.  It had a brightness dial, so the actual hues could vary according to a specific curve.
<John>	Hey all
<John>	Is there something similar to Numpy for JS?
<Gilgameshkun>	Isn't it nice? :D
<John>	(and has anyone used it? :P )
<Gilgameshkun>	Never used Numpy.
<Gilgameshkun>	Or heard of it.
<John>	Ah, ok - well basically it does 1 thing really well, and thats provide a new data type, the numpy array, which is very efficent at storing numbers in RAM
<John>	Like, a single number in python takes up 16bytes becasue of all the stuff that comes with it (descriptors, ability to change type, etc etc), whereas in numpy you define the array as all only haveing int32 or int16 (4 or 2 bytes), and then it really only uses 4 or 2 bytes to store each number
<John>	And if you try and put a number thats too big into the array, you get problems
<Gilgameshkun>	Awww, all that gushing because someone was interested in algorithms and I geeked out...and they're not even here anymore. XD
<Gilgameshkun>	Hm, that was quite impulsive of me.  I must be more manic than usual.
<lalaland1125>	John, there are typed arrays in new js versions.
<Gilgameshkun>	Oh, right. :3 Int8Array, Uint8Array, Int16Array, etc.
<John>	lalaland1125:  oh awesome :D
<Gilgameshkun>	They don't extend Array, so will not have all the same methods.
<Gilgameshkun>	But can be treated like arrays with indexing, .length, etc.
<lalaland1125>	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays
<Hannibal_Smith>	lalaland1125, this is very limited respect to what Numpy does
<Hannibal_Smith>	The person who asked the question corretly sais that Python objects are not really great space wise
<Hannibal_Smith>	But has also to consider that Numpy is a mix of C, assembly and highly optimized library
<lalaland1125>	Hannibal, yes, but john specifically requested an "array as only having int32 or int16 ..."
<inimino>	John: arraybuffers
<John>	Hannibal_Smith:  yeah, obviously Numpy is more than just its arrays - but the typed arrays are really the first starting point for me
<John>	But you're right, *I* should consider that
<Hannibal_Smith>	Yes, but using a typed array is not going to give to him the performance that Numpy is capable of
<John>	Hannibal_Smith:  well, i wouldn't be so sure - ive seen some speedtests recently which showed JS being extrodinarily fast for some things
<John>	As fast as C
<John>	But, you're right... this could be a week of work and no speed gain over Numpy
<Hannibal_Smith>	John, really, people often talk without considering what are they talking about
<John>	On IRC? definitely -_-
<John>	Its easier to type than think
<Gilgameshkun>	emscripten exploits these newer faster JS engines.
<Hannibal_Smith>	emscripten is not going to fix it
<Gilgameshkun>	Not going to fix what now?
<inimino>	If numpy is too slow, rewriting in JS wouldn't necessarily be the first thing I'd try.
<_HelpNeeded>	is there any way to track the which arc was clicked in this http://cssdeck.com/labs/canvas-wavey-particles-motion
<_HelpNeeded>	FFs sm1 help :P
<John>	inimino: it isn't too slow - but it just means my setup would involve Node.js with web interface, receiving requests, which then interacts probably via Celery to Redis which gives jobs to Python workers, which reply back to redis and then Node finally picks them up and returns the results
<John>	Or
<Hannibal_Smith>	Gilgameshkun, asmjs, js, don't expose a way to do any simd operation, access to certain instruction, doing multithreading
<John>	Just stay in Node.js land, take the performance hit at the benefit of greatly reduced setup
<Gilgameshkun>	Well, no.  That wouldn't necessarily be a good idea in JS anyway. :P
<Hannibal_Smith>	Numpy can use Intel MKL as a backend
<inimino>	John: anyway, you already know your algorithm and how much I/O and other work you need to do so you can benchmark it with considerably less than a week of work
<Hannibal_Smith>	That is primary hand written assembly math code
<John>	inimino:  yeah, but i've never used typed arrays in JS before, not how to interact with them
<John>	And im most likely not as good a programmer as you :P
<inimino>	John: well-documented, straightforward interface
<hughfdjackson>	mornin ^^
<hughfdjackson>	Sorella: hah - you're still around there here parts :D
<hughfdjackson>	yorick: .. wow, and you too
<_HelpNeeded>	plzz FFS sm1 help !! :P inimino or John  ne1 help !!
<yorick>	hughfdjackson: yes, but I never look at this channel
<yorick>	hughfdjackson: for good reasons :D
<hughfdjackson>	:D whoa, inimino too - many a blast from the past
<hughfdjackson>	yorick: :p
<inimino>	John: I'd be surprised if you can't read your data in and start playing with it in a couple hours.
*	inimino tips hat in the direction of hughfdjackson
<yorick>	hughfdjackson: we are in #inimino too
<yorick>	hughfdjackson: and maybe ##js
<_HelpNeeded>	 is there any way to track  which arc was clicked in this http://cssdeck.com/labs/canvas-wavey-particles-motion
<_HelpNeeded>	 is there any way to track the which arc was clicked in this http://cssdeck.com/labs/canvas-wavey-particles-motion
<inimino>	_HelpNeeded: that's not the way
<hughfdjackson>	yorick: what's the difference between.. ##javascript and ##js?
<_HelpNeeded>	den ?
<yorick>	hughfdjackson: moderation
<_HelpNeeded>	wats the way inimino :/
<John>	inimino:  wanna put some money on that? :P ;)
<John>	I'll try
<inimino>	hughfdjackson: and ##js has fewer people in it
<John>	Problem is, i also have to read this data from the disk where its stored in binary, and i've just never done anything like this in JS before
<inimino>	John: there might be a conflict of interest there if you took the other side :P
<John>	heheh, i cant lose! :P
<lalaland1125>	_HelpNeeded, you might want to try stackoverflow
<_HelpNeeded>	here the arcs are continouly redrawn den how to track dem !!
<inimino>	John: Yeah, but the end result is going to be something like 5 lines, so you should get there :)
<_HelpNeeded>	thats the biggest issue !!
<_HelpNeeded>	seems to me atlest !! :/
<hughfdjackson>	:p wow - the community splintered itself over moderation
*	hughfdjackson is reminded me of recent months in scalaz land
<Hannibal_Smith>	hughfdjackson, I don't even write a single line of Scala code, but also I know the drama from the Scalaz project :-P
<inimino>	_HelpNeeded: sometimes people are just here to chat, but you should find a way to make your question more interesting
<_HelpNeeded>	its straight ! :P
<_HelpNeeded>	how in the world will i make it more interesting !!
<Sorella>	hughfdjackson: yup
<steeze>	i just saw some code that looked like expression || expression. would this be common to see as a kind of conditional? like, if expression1 exists, you break out of the || so expression2 doesnt get evaluated?
<inimino>	if you don't know what kinds of questions get answered, just lurk for a while...
<inimino>	steeze: yes, very common
<hughfdjackson>	Hannibal_Smith: hard to miss :p
<steeze>	okay, just double checking. i assumed thats what he was doing
<inimino>	short-circuit evaluation, steeze
<steeze>	sweet thanks
<hughfdjackson>	steeze: it's more like "if expression1 is falsy, use expression2"
<_HelpNeeded>	grrrrr !!
<steeze>	hughfdjackson, makes sense. i saw it in a script call to include jquery if the window object does not exist
<hughfdjackson>	but that's the basic idea :)
<[Roosta]>	Is anyone familiar with KeystoneJS?  If so, I'm looking for help hooking into a POST of a list/model.  eg) callback when a User is created
<Hannibal_Smith>	http://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/05/07/bringing-asm-js-to-chakra-microsoft-edge/ <-Really nice that they explained what kind of optimization they have already implementated
<Hannibal_Smith>	For sure they are fast...they annunced asmjs support only a few months ago
<inimino>	that doesn't necessarily imply rapid development
<Hannibal_Smith>	inimino, why?
<inimino>	sometimes they just announce something when they've already developed it internally
<Hannibal_Smith>	Uhm you are right
<inimino>	sometimes then they ship it with all the bugs and everyone else has to live with them for the next 5-10 years
<Hannibal_Smith>	inimino, to be fair, the same approach of Google
<inimino>	it's an endemic disease of big orgs
<inimino>	just some have it worse than others
<Hannibal_Smith>	Completly agree
*	inimino goes to implement something
<Hannibal_Smith>	MS *recently* fired a lot of people that was doing QA
<inimino>	hughfdjackson: why aren't you in my channel :P
<Hannibal_Smith>	And now they are going with "develop and test yourself"
<Hannibal_Smith>	Or in better words "develop and let test the user"
<Hannibal_Smith>	Uhm my english is really terrible

<hughfdjackson>	REALLY TENUOUS SEGUE INCOMING
<hughfdjackson>	talking of writing and english - i was going to write up some sort of material (articles, ebook, etc - not sure yet) to help people learn and use promises effectively
<Hannibal_Smith>	hughfdjackson, http://www.nostarch.com/mg_statistics.htm !
<hughfdjackson>	It'd really help me if you peeps could let me know what your experience with promises has been
<kephra>	moin - i have a funny problem with setting a textarea's value
<hughfdjackson>	http://goo.gl/forms/vqvksiOL3L <- I constructed a survey for this very purpose
<kephra>	elem.value = "foobar"; I thought this should display in the text area, but it does not, because there is an anonymous-div wrap that holds the real value ... how to write into a textarea?
<kephra>	browser is ff 31.4
<hughfdjackson>	Hannibal_Smith: and here I was, reading regular stats books :|
<Hannibal_Smith>	hughfdjackson, I would be interested into reading in what cases people prefer callbacks to promise
<no_gravity>	>> 0.1+0.2
<ecmabot>	no_gravity: (number) 0.30000000000000004
<steeze>	man why have i not been using short circuit evaluation this whole time
<hughfdjackson>	Hannibal_Smith: If i get a lot of people's answers, perhaps there'll be some interesting reasons there :) (although i didn't ask exactly that Q)
<no_gravity>	if (Infinity<-Infinity) "What, -Infinity is bigger then Infinity?"
<no_gravity>	>> if (Infinity<-Infinity) "What, -Infinity is bigger then Infinity?"
<ecmabot>	no_gravity: undefined
<no_gravity>	>> if (Infinity<-Infinity) result="What, -Infinity is bigger then Infinity?";
<ecmabot>	no_gravity: undefined
<steeze>	should i risk readability or should i just use an if statement instead of short circuiting?
<Hannibal_Smith>	steeze, boring code is always the best :-P
<steeze>	haha thats lame
<steeze>	but probably best
<steeze>	are there any speed benefits?
<steeze>	probably not
<Hannibal_Smith>	None
<steeze>	but i wanna be the cool new hipster programmer
<steeze>	who writes really clever but totally unreadable code
<Hannibal_Smith>	steeze, then you should use some unknow language that compile to js! :-P
<Sorella>	(or write operator overloading with .valueOf/.toString)
<Hannibal_Smith>	Ahaha

<fredski02>	has anyone read the book eloquant javascript?
<Sorella>	(Though I guess you can do that with Haskell too. Kmett's source code reads like alien for me :P)
<Sorella>	fredski02: a lot of people have
<Hannibal_Smith>	Sorella, recently there was a little flame on that
<Sorella>	Hannibal_Smith: Kmett's code bases?
<fredski02>	Sorella: I'll take that as a "i should go read it now ha :p"
<Sorella>	I think the overuse of infix operators makes it hard to grasp, since you need to figure out what the symbols stand for, and there isn't much to help you. Though words might have the same problem
<Hannibal_Smith>	Sorella, https://github.com/sdiehl/wiwinwlh/issues/67
<Sorella>	Oh, that's something else (I think?)
<Hannibal_Smith>	(interesting how when I read some flame on Haskell, I see always the same people involved)
<ert3go>	Hello. I need to login to a website and see if there's any change under a specific element. How do I go about it?
<Sorella>	Kmett was telling Stephen that their example of Prims was wrong, but Tony made a sarcastic joke and Stephen locked the issue. Kmett then tweeted about it, and later apologised for that.
<Hannibal_Smith>	Sorella, yes

<deltab>	NBhosting: you can give each spike a data value that indicates which one it is
<NBhosting>	id on the spikes, can i see thagt on mouseover
<deltab>	yes, from the element
<NBhosting>	k
<deltab>	I'd make the spikes containers, with the image as background, and store the checkers within them
<NBhosting>	that was out first setup, not sure why we changed it
<NBhosting>	else its kinda impossible to know
<NBhosting>	well could be done on position
<NBhosting>	but much harder
<deltab>	you can get the coordinates of each spike and compare against those
<NBhosting>	yeah i gues i could store the positions
<deltab>	but I'd rather just look at the parent element :-)
<NBhosting>	yeah sounds easyer
<NBhosting>	instead of doing crazy stuff

<DragonPunch>	quick question, if i split my js into seperate files.
<DragonPunch>	is that okay.
<DragonPunch>	or will it mess stuff up.
<preaction>	does it work?
<PigDude_>	DragonPunch: i think that is safe to do.
<DragonPunch>	right now? yes.
<preaction>	then it works
<PigDude_>	DragonPunch: just make sure to wear a helmet
<DragonPunch>	okay, do i have to href the files in a specific order?
<DragonPunch>	or will it not matter.
<PigDude_>	you ought to source them in the order they're needed
<DragonPunch>	okay. say if a file calls a function thats in a diff file
<DragonPunch>	is that okay.
<DragonPunch>	like if i run function .... dog
<DragonPunch>	dog(x,y);
<DragonPunch>	and dog is instatiated in diff file
<DragonPunch>	er function dog(x,y)
<PigDude_>	it matters in es6
<PigDude_>	otherwise there are no restrictions, because there is no notion of module/namespace prior to es6
<PigDude_>	it is just a means to getting your code loaded
<PigDude_>	so your file may be split in arbitrary ways. that is, if everything works in a single file and you split without reordering the splits, everything is guaranteed to work exactly as when it was a single file
<DragonPunch>	ah.
<DragonPunch>	sweet
<DragonPunch>	i figured it out
<DragonPunch>	all i need to do is split the JS into 4 seperat files
<DragonPunch>	1 for the 'reactive real time' the other for 'form submits'  third for 'on clicks' and fourth for 'dragdrops'

<DragonPunch>	like extra extra caffeine.
<DragonPunch>	been doing it for 2 days now.
<DragonPunch>	going strong.
<PigDude_>	well that's a conclusive sample size
<beaky>	PigDude_: everything: design, implementation, testing
<beaky>	whenever i do even one of them it takes me 3hrs minimum to get anywehre :(
<PigDude_>	beaky: so you want to think faster?
<beaky>	yes
<DragonPunch>	i wish i can get some cocaine thuogh.
<PigDude_>	but what if you're just slow-minded
<beaky>	yeah my mind is prettyy slow
<PigDude_>	maybe your slow results are still better than somebody else's fast ones
<PigDude_>	i wouldn't worry too much. over time you'll get faster but don't rush out crap
<DragonPunch>	beaky: how many lines are you able to average in a day?
<DragonPunch>	beaky: not that lines are meaningful but its still better than nothing.
<beaky>	DragonPunch: less than 100
<PigDude_>	beaky: the more code you read and write, the faster/more accurately you will read and write code, presumably
<DragonPunch>	i do about 300-400 on average 700+ on my high caffiene with taking poppin pills days
<beaky>	hmm on second thought less than 1000 per day

<PigDude_>	beaky: most things work that way
<beaky>	PigDude_ but all these blogs and screencasts i read have programmers building working stuff in under 3hrs :(

<PigDude_>	preaction: it's the same idea, to transform one thing to anotehr

<PigDude_>	preaction: +100 -100 can easily be more important than +150
<preaction>	-100 is always better than +100
<DragonPunch>	beaky: i would say go fast. take drugs. than refactor and clean and diagram/document for 2 days.
<DragonPunch>	out of a week.
<DragonPunch>	you will release

<zpartw>	I took LSD recently (350 ug) for the first time and it unfortunately did not unlock my brain's hidden powers. It was really a huge disappointment after all the hype I had built up in my head about it.
<DragonPunch>	i dont think LSD would help me. i feel like cocaine would be better.
<PigDude_>	j201_: are we gonna have a Mitchell Report in the valley?
<DragonPunch>	lsd would just make me cry.
<zpartw>	Cocaine damages your brain and is thusly not recommended.
<DragonPunch>	i wonder if i go tell my doctor that im extremely depressed and  have a hard time focusing if he would prescribe me some ritalin or adderall
<zpartw>	Might temporarily help to focus, but cocaine was originally used for making negro slaves perform physical labor better.
<preaction>	no, they'd prescribe exercise and vitamins

<pyCasso>	https://bpaste.net/show/ce6254b0d5d8
<bprompt>	pyCasso:     hmm more specifics would help, you can append with .push() and prepend with  .unshift() on any array element
<DragonPunch>	zpartw: Oh right, you wanted that 'cog' icon feel. Right, that is fairly easy. It's called a 'Popover' so all you would do for that is, have a div with display: none; and when clicked make it display: normal. You can position it however you want. You can load data dynamically into it via XMLHTTP/AJAX. Btw, you should use a spinner to show that the data is loading or something like a spinner for when you do the AJAX call.
<DragonPunch>	zpartw: It's fairly easy.

<PigDude_>	DHTML so hot

<zpartw>	I have a bunch of <div>s with id="test1", test2, test3, etc. That are hidden by default in the bottom of the page. I want them to become visible and position themselves where the mouse is when clicking the little icon.
<zpartw>	(food)
<pyCasso>	PigDude: its the empty array defined on line 1

<ecmabot>	zpartw: cursor - CSS | MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor>
<pyCasso>	after ajax request. the data should be pushed into the data array
<PigDude_>	oh sorry, meant clientX
<DragonPunch>	zpartw: Yeah if you want it positioned for where the mouse is click, you would have to bring in the mousClick API in and probably get the coordinates of the  mouse click and tell the div to reposition itself to those coordinates.
<DragonPunch>	zpartw: There are libraries you can use for positioning though. A thorough one seems to be TetherJS. Look it up.
<PigDude_>	zpartw: you will get clientX and clientY on your event on click, use those to update the top/left styles of the target element(s)

<pyCasso>	how would i access an object responseText? data.responseText ??

*	MichD is now known as michd
<pyCasso>	bprompt: well my data is a json file
<bprompt>	pyCasso:    I'm thinking, if its' being parsed, it be scoping... check in the debugger what "data" inside that function is,  and check if there's a this.data
<bprompt>	Se_:    that looks very abstract, no something specific per se, but there's no execute in js per se, you execute when you do a function call, well, with the exception of IE, Internet Explorer has an .execCommand() and .execScript()
<Se_>	hmm i think the closest thing to execute is apply or call

<bprompt>	knod:    go up a level, check the next ancestor
<bprompt>	maki:     well... info2 was empty before that, so....  that's proper, there was no data before that
<knod>	bprompt: I mean what if the ancestor passed in doesn't even have the child element as a decendant?
<maki>	bprompt:  yes whenever i run it again with new data it removes the old data

<knod>	<div1><div2></div2><div1>, <div3><div4></div4><div3> <- what if someone does getElementsFromUntil( div4, div1 )
<bprompt>	knod:     depends on what you're doing, you could ... take whatever action, exit, do something else.. it depends on the context at hand
<knod>	Because the thing is returning a list
<bprompt>	maki:    var  info2 = [];    is creating it, if you have that on that level, when you're just trying to append to it, you may want to take it from there, so it doesn't recreate it, I'm thinking you're recreating it each time, thus wiping out anything that was  there
<knod>	I mean, the stuff that calls it is expecting a list.
<knod>	Maybe it should return an empty list!
<knod>	And log a message or warning or something
<maki>	bprompt: oh yes youre right i hade the info2 = []; inside the function so everytime it empty it up
<bprompt>	knod:     yeah, depending on what may be getting, run a conditional on that

This is causing my problems because the flux Dispatcher won’t allow me to call another action until ACTION_X is complete, which depends on rendering to complete.

<knod>	FenikkusuOsiris: Hmm, it must be a different browser or something. I'm not seeing anything at all there. The line is: innerLine.className = 'inner-line';

<YoutubeAPI>	knod: Is their any way around that, where I can still have its children show?
<knod>	Maybe it's a special kind of array...
<knod>	YoutubeAPI: I know this may be a frustrating question, but why would you want to hide a parent and just show a child?
<knod>	YoutubeAPI: Could you hide and show each child instead?
<Sorella>	zpartw: it's .forEach, not .foreach
<zpartw>	knod: You maybe meant console.log(typeof toggledApples);?
<knod>	zpartw: no
<YoutubeAPI>	What I'm thinking is where if they click on an item in the nav-bar, I could just clear everything and show only that 'page' (div)
<knod>	Sorella: I assumed he just mistyped it here because he seemed to indicate that he'd checked what '.foreach' was, and gotten a reasonable answer

<YoutubeAPI>	knod: I could do that, but I would end up having a lot of copy + pasted code.
<knod>	zpartw: what is your actual text there? .foreach or .forEach?
<zpartw>	knod: Anyway, that outputs "object"
<Sorella>	Yes, typeof doesn't give you the "tag" of the thing.
<zpartw>	Aaaaaaah! "foreach".
<zpartw>	The one time I don't bother with camelCase, it matters...
<YoutubeAPI>	knod: I was thinking a simple 2 line solution for each .click, like $(#Whole).hide & (#Videos).fadeIn(1000);
<knod>	YoutubeAPI: Why would you have more copy and pasted code that way? You make all the children once, then hide and show them. Is there something else going on?
<zpartw>	This is pretty hilarious, really. I seem to stumble upon every single pitfall that can happen.
<knod>	YoutubeAPI: What you might do is loop through all the children, hide them, then show the one that you want
<zpartw>	If this were a fantasy dungeon, I'd be long dead by now.
<knod>	zpartw: condolences. It happens to us all

<Torkable>	don't do it
<gtwy>	quick question
<gtwy>	https://jsfiddle.net/gtwy/327vybxv/ if you type in any of the boxes, it puts the text into the results
<gtwy>	i also need it to pull the value of li
<gtwy>	and put that in the results
<zpartw>	Um...
<gtwy>	im not sure how to attack that
<gtwy>	any advice?
<Torkable>	ok, back up, zpartw, why are you using those indexes
<knod>	YoutubeAPI: then when an item gets clicked on, you do $( '.' + evnt.target.dataset.page).fadeIn(1000);
<zpartw>	So I need to do all the .splice and .push BS again? Sigh...
<FenikkusuOsiris>	knob, line 140 of tool menu, reverse your boolean values.
<Torkable>	just wait, explain what you're trying to do
<zpartw>	Trying to keep track of which "apples" have been toggled.
<zpartw>	Each apple has an integer id.
<Torkable>	!ask @ zpartw
<ecmabot>	zpartw: Don't ask to ask, nor if anyone is here or alive or uses something. Just ask your question. http://www.mikeash.com/getting_answers.html http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
<zpartw>	It can be false or true.
*	m0noprotic is now known as mmango
<Torkable>	ok, if you have keys and values, use a data structure that supports that
<zpartw>	?
<Torkable>	like javascript objects
<knod>	FenikkusuOsiris: 1) Holy moly, thanks for working on this so long. 2) There's only a comment there in my Tool-Menu.js
<zpartw>	Jeez...
<Torkable>	?
<zpartw>	I'll just see if I can recode this crap back to using the normal kind of arrays with .push and .splice...
<knod>	I think
<Sorella>	zpartw: why are you doing `a[123] = x`?
<knod>	Torkable just did the wrong !
<zpartw>	Sorella: I am?
<knod>	I think he meant something like !xy
<Torkable>	>> { 34: true, 56: false, 111: true }
<ecmabot>	Torkable: SyntaxError: invalid label
<Torkable>	derp
<zpartw>	Sorella: Because the apple with id 123 need to be set...
<Sorella>	21:09 <zpartw> var toggledApples = []; toggledApples[4] = true; toggledApples[123] = true; toggledApples[18] = true;
<Torkable>	>> var foo = { 34: true, 56: false, 111: true }
<ecmabot>	Torkable: undefined
<FenikkusuOsiris>	knod, iconElem.className = toolMenu.checkedClasses; the if statement wrapping that
<Sorella>	zpartw: so you want a Set, not an array?
<ljharb>	zpartw: think of an array like a list of values, not something with arbitary indexes.
<Torkable>	he has keys and values
<knod>	FenikkusuOsiris: The icon is showing the right thing
<zpartw>	I'll recode it the usual way...
<Torkable>	id's and values
<Torkable>	just.... use an object lol
<knod>	FenikkusuOsiris: I think I left my console logs in there, they will show you
<ljharb>	zpartw: in php, an "associative array" has arbitrary keys and values, but in JS, that's not an array, that's an ojbect.
<ljharb>	*object
<FenikkusuOsiris>	knod, your boolean is reversed I believe. You're saying if true, it should be if false.
<knod>	FenikkusuOsiris: When the console says "true" the checkbox should be checked.
<knod>	Which it is
<knod>	It's just that true happens two times
<Sorella>	"associative array" isn't an array, in any case, unless you can have duplicated keys (like Emacs' assoc lists)
<knod>	It's true at the beginning and then when it's clicked the first time, it also says true
<FenikkusuOsiris>	knob, for quicks and giggles, try reversing it anyways. You may be surprised.
<Sorella>	And you don't want associative arrays like that because they're O(n) for retrieving values.
<knod>	FenikkusuOsiris: (it's knod, otherwise I won't get an alert) I'll try
<Sorella>	zpartw: use an object. Then iterate through the keys of that object.
<zpartw>	Okay, so splice() doesn't allow me to specify a value. Only an "index". So I have to... somehow loop through it again just to delete items.
<Torkable>	use an object
<Torkable>	ermergerd
<ljharb>	!xy @ zpartw
<ecmabot>	zpartw: The XY problem: You want to do X, but don't know how. You think you can solve it using Y, but don't know how to do that either. You ask about Y, which is a strange thing to want to do. Just ask about X.
<gtwy>	question is on the fiddle... could use help, im sure one of you can point me in the right direction. everything i have tried has failed https://jsfiddle.net/gtwy/327vybxv/
<Sorella>	>> var map = {}; map["125"] = true; map["13"] = true; Object.keys(map).sort().forEach(function(key){ console.log(key, map[key]) })
<ecmabot>	Sorella: undefined; Console: '125', true, '13', true
<ljharb>	you don't want to use splice. you don't want an array. you want an "associative array" which in most languages is not called "array" - in JS, it's an object.
<Sorella>	Erm...
<Sorella>	>> var map = {}; map["125"] = true; map["13"] = true; Object.keys(map).sort(function(a, b){ return a - b }).forEach(function(key){ console.log(key, map[key]) })
<ecmabot>	Sorella: undefined; Console: '13', true, '125', true
<Sorella>	Though if you really want an ordered dictionary, and you're going to have more than 100 keys and running that iteration often, you'll want to pick a better data structure.
<gtwy>	is there a way to call a parent object
<zpartw>	Do I break or return to get out from a forEach?
<gtwy>	this.parent
<gtwy>	or something like that
<Sorella>	zpartw: you can't "get out of a forEach", it isn't a loop.
<Sorella>	zpartw: what are you trying to do?
<gtwy>	i am trying to work with an object that contains an object that im working with
<knod>	FenikkusuOsiris: Trying, I just have to wait for github to catch up with the change
<gtwy>	and im trying to call a ?sibling? object
<zpartw>	I'm trying to delete from an array of integers, a specified integer. Ignore any concept of "indexes", please.

<knod>	FenikkusuOsiris: is it showing without an error for you right now? It should be printing "true" to start with
<Sorella>	zpartw: "hash table" and maps are fundamental data structures
<FenikkusuOsiris>	knod, okay. Seems to be refreshed to me, though it's giving a different error.
<GreenJello>	zpartw, it's something used in every language
<Sorella>	You learn them in CS 101
<zpartw>	I've never seen them or used them.
<FenikkusuOsiris>	knod, it does print true (it was before)
<Torkable>	eloquent book link?
<knod>	FenikkusuOsiris: Yes, I took care of the error about 5 mins ago, but it hasn't caught up
<zpartw>	Why exactly do you need something other than arrays for this?
<Sorella>	I can see how one wouldn't see them if they hadn't gone through formal CS classes though. But still...
<knod>	FenikkusuOsiris: Yeah, I just added the other print statement in to show that it is true from the start
<zpartw>	!Map
<zpartw>	??hashtable
<knod>	FenikkusuOsiris: As soon as raw git catches up with my fix, it should show it just fine
<Sorella>	zpartw: because data structures aren't universal. People always come up with new ones because you have to make tradeoffs between memory, performance, lookup, and all sorts of things.
<knod>	FenikkusuOsiris: Try it now
<zpartw>	This is just...
<FenikkusuOsiris>	knod, it seems to be working as you were expecting it now.
<knod>	FenikkusuOsiris: Now the checkmark works opposite of the console log, and it's still true at the start and at the first click
<Sorella>	zpartw: in this case the trade off is that arrays allow you to have any number of objects, even duplicated ones, but looking an object you need to look through ALL OF THEM. A hash table requires you to index objects by some unique identifiers, so you can't have duplicates, but looking an object requires just one operation / looking just one object
<deltab>	zpartw: looking things up by name is a very common operation, but comparing strings character by character is relatively slow (compared to fixed-size numbers, for instance), especially if you're doing it for every element of a list
<zpartw>	"This is an experimental technology, part of the ECMAScript 6 (Harmony) proposal." <-- Map section in MDN...
<zpartw>	And the hash table docs are for some internal C stuff talking about .h files...
<FenikkusuOsiris>	knod, the problem is that when the function is ran, your checkbox is in the previous state, not the new state. So true is the state you're coming from, not the state you are going to.
<Sorella>	zpartw: that's why you've been told to use "objects", not Map
<zpartw>	How exactly am I supposed to "use" an object in this context?
<Sorella>	zpartw: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects
<GreenJello>	var o = {}; o[key] = value;
<kr4sh>	can anyone tell me how to set something onclick for a function?  Like... onclick=function(' + variable + )   then.. function() retrieve string?
<knod>	FenikkusuOsiris: It shouldn't be, not with mouseup. Also, in that case, why would 'click' work and 'mouseup' not work? 'click' is just "mousedown" and "mouseup" happening on the same element.
<zpartw>	Right. Faking PHP arrays.
<GreenJello>	what php calls an array is unlike most languages
<zpartw>	I guess that'll work. Except when I need to loop through its items.
<deltab>	zpartw: PHP's arrays are maps
<Sorella>	zpartw: I'd *REALLY* recommend learning algorithms and data structures, though.
<deltab>	hash tables
<FenikkusuOsiris>	knod, mouseup and mousedown are called prior to the dom updating likely.
<gtwy>	kr4sh: with jquery or pure js
<kr4sh>	gtwy: pure js preferred
<Sorella>	Can PHP's associative arrays contain duplicates?
<FenikkusuOsiris>	knod, click on the other hand is called after the dom updates.
<FenikkusuOsiris>	Sorella, no
<Sorella>	Okay, they're not arrays them
<Sorella>	then*
<GreenJello>	!addeventlistener @ kr4sh
<knod>	FenikkusuOsiris: for realz? But that early detection thing you mentioned would happen with click!
<GreenJello>	!mdn addeventlistener @ kr4sh
<ecmabot>	kr4sh: EventTarget.addEventListener() - Web API Interfaces | MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener>
<FenikkusuOsiris>	Sorella, duplicate keys*
<Sorella>	zpartw: so, PHP's associative arrays are actually hash tables.
<Jeroen1>	Who can help me? On line 36 I writen down what's going wrong. http://pastebin.com/iBDnxwwd
<GreenJello>	kr4sh, and in the handler you call the function with whatever arguments you like
<GreenJello>	or see $.on for jQuery
<Sorella>	zpartw: you've known them since forever, just by a different name.
<zpartw>	Hmm...
<FenikkusuOsiris>	knod, that's true. Sometimes you just have to bow to it and say huh...whatever
<zpartw>	Well, what about looping through all the "properties" that I set of this "object" that, to me, is a PHP array?
<Sorella>	Real associative arrays are things like: [[key, value], [key, value]]. Which you'd find in old Lisps.
<gtwy>	k4r1m: start here http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_events.asp
<deltab>	Sorella: yes, though they're sometimes used as arrays (numbered keys), sometimes sets, depending on the function used
<zpartw>	A lot of things are called different things in different contexts. This is very confusing.
<Sorella>	zpartw: Object.keys(someObject) will give you all the keys of that object.
<knod>	Guys, is it true that mouseup is detected before any dom changes?
<Sorella>	zpartw: welcome to computer science, where we can't actually reach any consensus on anything
<GreenJello>	knod, before what dom changes?
<gtwy>	i am probably missing something silly but if anyone could take a quick look, i just dont think im calling .parent correctly https://jsfiddle.net/gtwy/327vybxv/
<Sorella>	(But then PHP is just awful in everything, specially naming concepts)
<knod>	FenikkusuOsiris: Thing is, that when I did 'click', it would do it twice I think. The first tiem it would be wrong and the second time it would be right. I think. I will check again locally
<knod>	GreenJello: checkbox
<GreenJello>	knod, maybe, but use 'change' for checkboxes
<ljharb>	zpartw: by default, assume that any pattern in php that's different from other things is wrong :-)
<Jeroen1>	Anyone who knows what I'm doing wrong there? :/
<GreenJello>	knod, otherwise when people toggle it with the keyboard or clicking the label, you won't get the event
<Sorella>	zpartw: in any case, why do you need to iterate over the keys?
<kr4sh>	my head hurts now :(
<knod>	GreenJello: holy shit. There's an event for a checkbox changing? I feel just a bit dumb :P
<deltab>	Jeroen1: locations[i] isn't an array with 4 elements
<gtwy>	oh i got it
<gtwy>	nice
<gtwy>	was missing ()
<synergy_>	falafel: That was to me right?
<Jeroen1>	It is deltab? :o
<deltab>	Jeroen1: console.log it and find out
<Jeroen1>	(1) home sweet home, (2) 51.54317, (3) 5.80549, (4) "hier woon ik!"
<deltab>	gtwy: please don't point people to w3schools; some of their stuff is okay, but next to stuff that's atrociously bad
<zpartw>	Got it working, but wondering about something still. Am I right in thinking that I can choose to ignore any and all of the three arguments that the callback functions for forEach supports, and that I can name them anything I feel like?
<zpartw>	As long as they are in the right order?
<zpartw>	That is: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach
<Jeroen1>	delta6: Console.log: ["Home Sweet Home", 51.65317, 5.80649, "Hier woon ik!"]
<zpartw>	(element, index, array)
<zpartw>	I can do only (a)?
<zpartw>	I can do (a, b)?
<zpartw>	Or (a, b, c)?
<Jeroen1>	I think it's because I should add this. or something
<Jeroen1>	but don't know how and where.
<deltab>	Jeroen1: is that locations or a particular element of it?
<zpartw>	"Hier woon ik" = "Here lives I"?
<Jeroen1>	Yeah
<Jeroen1>	But that's just exacly translated and you should not.
<Jeroen1>	I have no clue what's going wrong.
<Jeroen1>	it does work if I write them hard-coded.
*	Sorella zpartw: yes. In JS, all parameters are optional.
<Sorella>	Ugh
<deltab>	Jeroen1: it's because i changes between when addListener is called and when the callback runs
<Sorella>	I mean, in JS all arguments are optional. And what you name your parameters is irrelevant
<deltab>	!last
<ecmabot>	deltab: If something is only being applied to the 'last' one of many, you might have a scoping problem. e.g.: in for (i=0; i<5; ++i) {doX(function(){ doY(i); });} `doY' might only receive 5 as a value. You can solve this using closures, so see !closures. For more info see http://www.mennovanslooten.nl/blog/post/62/
<zpartw>	I noticed when I tried just now, but sometimes, things are possible, but still wrong. Like, it could be due to a bug in the engine, or undefined behaviour, or just simply bad behaviour that isn't recommended.
<Jeroen1>	!closures
<ecmabot>	Jeroen1: For experienced users: http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/chapter-6-closures/ . For newbies: http://blog.jhades.org/really-understanding-javascript-closures/
<zpartw>	So "try it and see" is bad advice (not that you said that).
<ljharb>	it's great advice.
<ljharb>	it's almost *never* a bug in the engine or undefined behavior.
<Jeroen1>	delta6: Still don't know what I'm doing wrong with that information.
<shoky>	Jeroen1: also answered you on #jquery about how to solve it
<Sorella>	!ecma @ zpartw
<ecmabot>	zpartw: Found: Introduction <http://es5.github.io/#introduction>
<ljharb>	zpartw: but, you can just try it in two browsers, and you'll know for sure.
<Sorella>	Unlike PHP, JS is a well-defined language, and the specification covers all the things related to behaviours
<deltab>	uh, better-defined, let's say :-)

<zpartw>	Sorella: More like... "not doing any active work for quite some time, and suddenly it's bedtime again".
<Gurkenglas>	Oh wait, it didn't work for reasons I thought specific to the language (and known to any programmer, which would thus be able to point me there), not on my own fail I just noticed. Disregard me.
<Jeroen1>	Great thanks got it working and do understand it now. :)
<falafel>	synergy_, Reactive Programming course on Coursera
<falafel>	synergy_, they have a new one now, I compelte the first one from 2013
<falafel>	*completed
<synergy_>	falafel: Should I learn Scala first?
<falafel>	synergy_,  you don't really need to know Scala, just the basic concepts. They just go through the interfaces, and use cases, marble diagrams to understand the behavior...
*	Audioburn is now known as Audio
*	Audio is now known as il
<falafel>	synergy_, it is more about the theory, the practice you can do it in any language with higher-order functions
<falafel>	provided you can read Scala interfaces, that's all you need
<synergy_>	falafel: I'll look through some docs
<falafel>	synergy_, also, read the classic FRP paper by Conal Elliot, and look at stuff by Evan Czaplicki, the creator of Elm
<falafel>	his thesis is all about reactive programming
<synergy_>	falafel: Ok
<synergy_>	falafel: I want to talk more about this now, but I have to do homework
<falafel>	synergy_, good luck, it'll click in your mind eventually
<Sorella>	(I'd recommend learning Haskell, since you'll find a lot of these things with Haskell examples and stuff)
<Sorella>	(And you'll be able to understand the Scala examples then as well)
<falafel>	yes, that would be ideal
<falafel>	that's where you'll find most FRP implementations anyway, the RP observable model is more popular though
<falafel>	I come to find out that the generator approach is close to arrowized frp
<Sorella>	Yeah, FRP didn't quite take off
<Sorella>	Though it ended up influencing quite a bit of things I guess
<synergy_>	Sorella: Thanks for the advice
<falafel>	I think it didn't take off because behaviors on the web are rarely a thing, you work with events, specially async stuff
<synergy_>	falafel: I'm still working on my data structure and this'll help to get the execution done well :)
<Sorella>	Yeah, there's that
<Berra>	How should I handle cleanup of event listeners? When I run new Object() it registers it's own event listener on the window, but I want to clean it up when the object is no longer wanted by the user.
<Sorella>	Berra: Element.removeEventListener. You'll need a reference to the handler passed to addEventListener.

<steelbrain>	Coldblackice: codecademy.com or maybe mdn tutorials
*	Coldblackice 
<Coldblackice>	thanks steelbrain. The issue I have with those online ones is that it doesn't really give an all-around approach to learning the subject
<Coldblackice>	seems more like scattered points of learning
<stanford_drone>	Our startup got funded! We're building a personal gaming flying robot. Does anyone know computer vision or Artificial Intelligence? Do you want to come to shenzhen, china from July to October, and work with us?
<asteele>	lol congratulations
<asteele>	sounds fun
<Coldblackice>	stanford_drone: what sort of experience/background should this person have?
<stanford_drone>	computer vision or AI is ideal. related things are good too. mostly systems, linux, bash
<YoutubeAPI>	I'm trying to remove my Viewport meta tag using jQuery with .remove and its not going through for me.
<YoutubeAPI>	I want the viewport for mobile devices removed once a specific event occurs.
<YoutubeAPI>	I've set an ID for my meta tag [view] and am using $("#view").remove(); in jQuery
<Coldblackice>	stanford_drone: and would this be someone with years of experience, or someone who's got all-around programming knowledge and able to learn it quickly
<gtwy>	i have a drop down. when you click the drop down it does something
<gtwy>	however, when someone clicks OUTSIDE of the drop down
<gtwy>	i want it to do something else
<roadrunneratwast>	hey would anyone be willing to give me feedback on my code sample
<gtwy>	to cancel out the whole event
<stanford_drone>	Coldblackice, either works.
<gtwy>	like is there a way to watch for a click EVERYWHERE except div#here
<YoutubeAPI>	Soo.. Any way to remove that viewport?
<preaction>	gtwy: watch for one everywhere, and then check if the click was inside div#here
<gtwy>	i can do all of that except the if statement
<gtwy>	not sure how that would look
<beaky>	hello
<foofin>	Hello!
<gtwy>	even.target
<beaky>	is there something like sql's GROUP BY in javascript
<gtwy>	wait let me try before i cry wolf
<falafel>	beaky, what is an example of input/output?
<YoutubeAPI>	Maybe I should just ask my question another time /:
<beaky>	groupBy('a', [{a: 1}, {a: 1}, {a:2}]) -> [{a: 1}, {a: 2}]
<beaky>	usually used in combiation with aggregation functions tho
<beaky>	maybe like agg(count, 'a', [{a: 1}, {a: 1}, {a:2}]) -> [{"1": 2}, {"2": 1}]
<falafel>	beaky, how about `groupBy(dot('a'), coll)`, that's a bit more generic
<beaky>	sure i can use map reduce
<falafel>	beaky, right, there is nothing builtin

<beaky>	my dream is to compile sql in javascipt
<falafel>	beaky, just create your own helper, is like 4 or 5 lines of code
<deltab>	or use a library such as lodash
<falafel>	beaky, here http://dpaste.com/2NNRSTG
<beaky>	wow is that es6
<falafel>	yes
<beaky>	how do i use es6
<falafel>	Babel
<beaky>	what is babel
<falafel>	but is trivial in es5, just use `function(){}` instead
<falafel>	beaky, an esX to es5 compiler
<cool_boy>	I can't find syntax error in https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2430b41247a93a7f89d2
<cool_boy>	could someone help me or any tip how to find out?
<falafel>	cool_boy, jshint.com
<falafel>	paste it there
<falafel>	10 warnings, 4 undefined variables, 3 unused variables
<cool_boy>	falafel: okay so I don't understand that it says, on line 20  "Expected '}' to match '{' from line 3 and instead saw '{'." but why?
*	Guest53385 is now known as Torkable
<cool_boy>	{  from line 3 is closed at  line 30 , why it is exṕecting on line 20, what I have missed ?
<ljharb>	cool_boy: line 20. function, not funtion.
<falafel>	^^
<ljharb>	cool_boy: also the word is "dimensions" not "dimentions" fwiw
<cool_boy>	ljharb: thanks
<cool_boy>	still the error jshit is stating seem irrelevant to me :(
<cool_boy>	only for that error, but for other rest it really helps
<beaky>	wow babel is awesome im using es6
<beaky>	how come nodejs doesnt support es6 natively yet
<falafel>	beaky, use iojs, it supports many features
<falafel>	nvm install iojs
<beaky>	what is nvm
<falafel>	!g nvm @ beaky
<ecmabot>	beaky: creationix/nvm · GitHub <https://github.com/creationix/nvm>
<Sorella>	Kinda sad that Node stable still doesn't support WeakMaps and Symbols.
<beaky>	wow thanks ill try out iojs hope its like nodejs
<falafel>	beaky, it is Node, just updated to the latest V8, and with some fixes
<Sorella>	beaky: iojs *IS* node, just with an updated v8 version, and a different release policy
<daviorocha>	hi, Why I am getting this result, I am doing date.setMonth(date.getMonth() - 2) and my GMT is -0300 and the result one is -0200, here is the code https://jsfiddle.net/5y1ex6ex/

<deltab>	daviorocha: DST didn't apply 2 months ago?
<daviorocha>	deltab: hummmm...  right!
<deltab>	fahadash: a jquery collection; check its length property
<fahadash>	thanks
<YoutubeAPI>	I'm trying to remove my Viewport meta tag using jQuery with .remove and its not going through for me.
<YoutubeAPI>	I want the viewport for mobile devices removed once a specific event occurs. I've set an ID for my meta tag [view] and am using $("#view").remove(); in jQuery
<PigDude>	is that possible? i thought the meta tag just gets read when the page loads but i hadn't dug into this
<cool_boy>	I am getting error undefined is not a function from http://jsfiddle.net/yvbde4ju/ code
<deltab>	YoutubeAPI: is the selectopr matching? check the length
<YoutubeAPI>	deltab: what do you mean?
<PigDude>	he means are you certain your jquery call is picking up any nodes
<PigDude>	more specifically, the node you want
<beaky>	wow iojs gives better error messages than nodejs
<YoutubeAPI>	PigDude: 'node'?
<PigDude>	YoutubeAPI: element
<YoutubeAPI>	oh
<YoutubeAPI>	Yes
<YoutubeAPI>	I'm certain
<PigDude>	beaky: heh i threw my gulp build at it today for fun and all sorts of stuff was weirdly broken (2.0.1)
<beaky>	:(
<YoutubeAPI>	So I'm not quite sure what to do :p
<YoutubeAPI>	I've even tried blanking the content on the viewport once the event had occurred, but that just blanked the entire page.
<deltab>	either the element isn't removed or removing it has no effect
<PigDude>	what are you trying to do exactly?
<deltab>	(or both)
<PigDude>	Bo Knows Truth Tables
<YoutubeAPI>	It's a little complicated, but basically once a button is clicked (which fires off a jQuery event) I want to remove my mobile viewport
<PigDude>	what does that mean, remove my mobile viewport?
<PigDude>	blank the screen? zoom out?
<YoutubeAPI>	The viewport meta used for mobile devices
<YoutubeAPI>			<meta id="view" name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<PigDude>	understood
<PigDude>	what do you expect to happen when you remove this tag
<YoutubeAPI>	When the button is clicked and the event is fired off, you're redirected elsewhere and the page just doesn't look right with that viewport.
<YoutubeAPI>	When I've taken off the viewport, it works perfectly fine.
<PigDude>	YoutubeAPI: have you tried updating the node's `content` attribute, rather than removing the node?
<PigDude>	YoutubeAPI: searching around, some people say that works
<YoutubeAPI>	PigDude: I've tried just blanking the content attribute.
<PigDude>	YoutubeAPI: maybe try setting it to something that will work for you
<YoutubeAPI>	I'm not too familiar with the viewport meta
<PigDude>	YoutubeAPI: some spec probably says what the default is, i'm too lazy to research that for you
<PigDude>	YoutubeAPI: heh there's even a quirksmode post about it, you're in luck http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2011/06/dynamically_cha.html
<YoutubeAPI>	Thanks, I'll read it now.
<gtwy>	YoutubeAPI: funny cat videos
*	gtwy shrugs
<gtwy>	I was expecting a list of results
<YoutubeAPI>	PigDude: And I could probably just grab the page width and slap it onto the content attribute
<PigDude>	YoutubeAPI: that would be violent
<YoutubeAPI>	I mean, carefully place the page width onto the content attribute.
<PigDude>	that's right, this channel is a Safe Place
<greenride>	Is it possible to access the browsers rendering engine internals through javascript?
<preaction>	greenride: to do what?
<Sorella>	greenride: sure. Just not in code executing in a regular webpage
<greenride>	preaction: I have about 4 or 5 tasks that I'd like to achieve. #1: I want to determine whether a new element tree renders identically to the initial version from which it was created. The new version is different.
<greenride>	#2: I want to know the exact placement of characters within a textnode.
<greenride>	#3: I want to know the color of a set of pixels.
<greenride>	Sorella: So, rendering engine properties other than the basics such as boundingBox dimensions can't be accessed by javascript running in a regular page?
<preaction>	you won't get that just by using javascript inside a page, as Sorella said
<PigDude>	greenride: why would the new element tree be different?
<PigDude>	greenride: is there something different about its content?
<greenride>	PigDude: I want to mark portions of the text with spans.
<PigDude>	and?
<greenride>	that's it
<PigDude>	i feel like you answered a totally different question
<PigDude>	rendering behavior doesn't vary in a browser version, you can be sure things look a certain way
<PigDude>	if you need great control maybe use canvas or something?
<greenride>	PigDude: If I take <p>Some sentence that someone else wrote</p> and change to <p>Some sentence <span>that</span> someone else wrote</p>; how can I know for sure that the rendering has not changed?
<PigDude>	by knowing how you've styled spans
<deltab>	you can render elements into a canvas
<greenride>	deltab: I'll Google canvases and read up on those. Thanks.
<YoutubeAPI>	Every time I try changing the viewport I just get a blank page
<YoutubeAPI>	http://beyondtheactual.kkhorram.info/js_ver/
<greenride>	PigDude: If this is library code, I wouldn't know how the page was styled.
<YoutubeAPI>	The viewport's content attribute I mean
<Sorella>	greenride: I feel like you're attacking the problem in the wrong way. You should try just relying on flow layouting and styling the things correctly in CSS instead
<YoutubeAPI>	Even if I change it to the exact same initial content
<YoutubeAPI>	It just blanks
<PigDude>	YoutubeAPI: your page has an error...
<deltab>	changing it how?
<PigDude>	YoutubeAPI: open your console
<YoutubeAPI>	oh
<PigDude>	YoutubeAPI: presumably you want to use the jQuery attr() function
<greenride>	deltab: Was that last comment to me?
<deltab>	no
<PigDude>	greenride: is it library code?

<Sorella>	greenride: it's impossible to guarantee that doing that isn't going to change the layout. Just use some class on your span and ask the user to style that class accordingly

<YoutubeAPI>	PigDude: I don't drink.

<fahadash>	How do I get the first jquery object from a collection returned by find?

<greenride>	PigDude: with artificial flavors
<PigDude>	fahadash: .first()?
<PigDude>	greenride: they claim on the website to not have artificial flavors, i'm shocked tbh
<fahadash>	how do I get subsequent objects? using et() ?

<ecmabot>	fahadash: Please visit #jquery for questions related to jQuery. (by typing /join #jquery)
<deltab>	eq
<PigDude>	fahadash: .eq()
<greenride>	Sorella: Is it really impossible? Wouldn't it be possible to get the styles on the parent element containing the text_node and then get the styles on the subString of the text node, which was newly enclosed in the span tag?
<deltab>	there's also lt and gt
<fahadash>	Thank you
<Sorella>	greenride: no.
<Sorella>	greenride: styles can change dynamically, they can be affected by pseudo-selectors (like :hover, etc), they can be affected by addition of new elements to the DOM, etc.
<greenride>	Sorella: Did you answer the first question or the second?
<Sorella>	You can't control any of those things
<Sorella>	Plus, how CSS affects a page is a freaking complicated thing, so you can't really deal with that short of writing your own layouting engine.
<greenride>	Sorella: Isn't the effect of CSS on a page determined by the CSSOM?
<greenride>	Sorella: So, it should be standards compliant, right?
<greenride>	Sorella: But, you're right about different things affecting the style.
<Sorella>	greenride: it's determined by several factors.
<Sorella>	Which you can't figure out by looking at a single element
<voltagex>	what's the best way to learn about javascript build/dependency systems? I'm confused about when to use grunt/gulp/bower - I also have access to Safari Books Online so book suggestions are also appreciated
<Coldblackice>	what's your endgoal?
<voltagex>	Coldblackice: to run a makefile or similar and have the skeleton of a project set up including Leaflet & plugins
<voltagex>	Coldblackice: for a small team
<Sorella>	voltagex: you only need to learn about npm. You can use whatever build system you already use (we use Make at work)
<voltagex>	Sorella: isn't npm for Node? (also we're on Windows and npm creates insane directory structures)
<Sorella>	voltagex: no, npm is a package manager for JavaScript. As for windows, you won't usually run into problems using it. Lots of people use Windows at work and they do just fine (though recently we've moved to using Vagrant for everything anyway)
*	morlenxus is now known as Guest97285
<voltagex>	Sorella: so why would I choose npm over bower?
<zpartw>	Is it just me, or does ES6 kinda feel like Duke Nukem Forever?
*	morle is now known as morlenxus
<Havvy>	It's only 'insane' because Windows has a really stupid directory length limit.
<Sorella>	voltagex: because bower can't resolve dependencies, and it doesn't know what JavaScript is.
<voltagex>	Havvy: yeah, but last time I had to boot a livecd to delete my node_modules directory
<Havvy>	zpartw:  It'll be officially finished sometime in the new couple months.
<Sorella>	voltagex: IOW, bower is just a "wget on steroids"
<voltagex>	Sorella: fair enough
<Havvy>	But yes, it is a couple years late.
<deltab>	npm has a nested dependency tree; bower's is flat
<Havvy>	`npm` is trying to make it a bit more flat when npm 3.0 comes out.
<rcyr>	I kind of like using jspm with the bower endpoint plugin
<Sorella>	zpartw: I wouldn't say that two years in development for a language specification is that much time. Considering all of the limitations they need to consider, it's fairly reasonable
<rcyr>	It works well with bower/npm/their own repo/github/ and allow you to easily use babel+systemjs without a watcher or anything.
<voltagex>	rcyr: that's the first time I've seen jspm, thanks.
<rcyr>	voltagex: I'm still "trying it"
<rcyr>	voltagex: What the "JavaScript in 2015" youtube video embedded on their front page
<rcyr>	*watch
<voltagex>	http://odetocode.com/blogs/scott/archive/2015/02/18/using-jspm-with-visual-studio-2015-and-asp-net-5.aspx seals it for me, but I wish I didn't need to use a 6to5 transpiler for it.
<rcyr>	voltagex: You don't know it yet... but _YOU WANT_ to use one :P
<rcyr>	And if you decide to... use babel, not traceur

<rcyr>	voltagex: Better ES6 support

<rcyr>	voltagex: I mean.. you do need npm to install jspm... but beside that
<rcyr>	voltagex: Ahh ok

<voltagex>	greenride: I IRC through a VPS hosted elsewhere, I highly recommend it ;)
<rcyr>	cool_boy: Where do you set position: absolute?
<rcyr>	cool_boy: Might be worthwhile to learn CSS before backbone.
<greenride>	voltagex: It was my ISP; so, that wouldn't have helped.
<Sorella>	(Or you can just pay for IRCCloud)
<voltagex>	Sorella: I looked at that too, have you used it?
*	Sorella is using it
<cool_boy>	rcyr: yeah its that, thanks
<zpartw>	Why can't they simply support JS as it is right now, but also support a whole new JavaScript that is only activated with something like use strict;?
<zpartw>	I never cease to be amazed by how they cannot think of such an obvious thing.
<zpartw>	Why do they have to take care about old code?
<greenride>	Sorella: irc cloud looks nice.
<rcyr>	zpartw: Do you know how long it can be for a committee to achieve consensus?
<greenride>	Sorella: Thanks
<zpartw>	rcyr: Not really?
<rcyr>	zpartw: "Years" was the answer.
<rcyr>	Not, "Not Really?"
<Sorella>	zpartw: because JS semantics suck. "use strict" takes some of the suck-ness away, such that people who write JS VMs can make them much faster.
<zpartw>	Sorella: Huh?
<zpartw>	Yeah, I just mentioned it due to the syntax being similar.
<deltab>	new code has to work with old libraries
<zpartw>	It would maybe be: "use new;"
<Sorella>	zpartw: it's the same language, just some stuff "taken away". A subset of the language, if you will
<nahtnam>	Hey!
<zpartw>	Sorella: I think you missed what I said originally.
<rcyr>	It only took 6 years to create ES6... and a lot of it was based on previous work (ES4)
<zpartw>	I wasn't talking about use strict;, but about how they won't do this (to me) obvious thing.
<rcyr>	Guess how much time it would take to create a new language.
<zpartw>	Hmm...
<Sorella>	zpartw: which obvious thing?
<zpartw>	Replace committee?
<rcyr>	zpartw: Same shit happens with C++..... it tooks 13 years
<zpartw>	Sorella: To keep JS supported as is, but activate a whole new engine if the script has "use new;" in the top.
<nahtnam>	Im pretty new to javascript. I was wondering if there was a way to make it so that every 10 seconds everything in the <main> tags refreshes, but not the whole page. I have looked into ajax, but the examples only how how to edit a single <div> with returned json.
<Sorella>	zpartw: that's impossible.
<zpartw>	Sorella: How so?
<deltab>	any new syntax would cause the whole script to fail in older parsers
<Sorella>	zpartw: it's already too much work to support a single engine. Supporting two would open up the doors for all the security vulnerabilities, they wouldn't be able to do proper optimisations, they would have to kill the semantics such that the languages can interoperate, etc, etc, etc. It's just not worth it
<greenride>	Sorella: Did you reply to my comment, "There's only one javascript thread. So, I can fire an event when the original parent element is ..."?
<greenride>	If you did, I missed that while disconnected.
<danillo10>	Someone want to program until tomorrow ?
<greenride>	danillo10: Program what?
<preaction>	only 40 minutes?

<greenride>	I see
<danillo10>	i'm on codeacademy
<danillo10>	learn javascript
<voltagex>	rcyr: mind === blown
<greves>	i can't figure out if this error is coming from python or javascript - anyone able to help me look? https://github.com/markfinger/python-webpack/issues/18
<voltagex>	rcyr: I want to use ES6 RIGHT NOW
<rcyr>	voltagex: Yup :) For an overview: https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features
<danillo10>	i love programming!
<danillo10>	;X
<Sorella>	voltagex: the only interesting features in ES6 are Generators, PTC and WeakMaps, which are not yet implemented anywhere (WeakMaps are on iojs, actually), and you can't really emulate them
<rcyr>	Sorella: These are things that most people won't use.
<rcyr>	haha
<Sorella>	Generators are also implemented in v8
<zpartw>	Sorella: :(
<Sorella>	rcyr: those people are WRONG :P
<danillo10>	greenride pm
<zpartw>	Is there a .js file which fakes in ES6 support for ES6-lacking browsers/engines?
<deltab>	PTC?
<NBhosting>	mm a drageble element snapping back to its original position aint that easy. anyone even done this?
<zpartw>	Or is it even possible?
<Sorella>	Mermaid's runtime is all based on WeakMaps though. I'm not sure if WeakMaps support billions of objects yet, but we'll see...
<zpartw>	PTC?
<rcyr>	Sorella: Hehe :)
<NBhosting>	only thing i found is revert
<rcyr>	zpartw: Proper Tail Calls
<zpartw>	Never heard of.
<rcyr>	I hate that acronym.
<beaky>	i liek arrows
<beaky>	and desturciting
<voltagex>	Sorella, rcyr: I'm thinking import and export default new will save me lots of boilerplate
<rcyr>	TCO = okay, TCE too... PTC is bad.
<Sorella>	zpartw: Tail Call Optimisation, but with some differences (which I can never remember)
<rcyr>	I'm happy for classes.... not because I will use them but mainly because everyone else will.
<Sorella>	voltagex: you get more with macros for that.
<rcyr>	Gone will be the days of "I'm going to create my own class systems!!"
<beaky>	wow it took js 2 decades to finaly support oop
<Sorella>	rcyr: I wouldn't count on that. Never underestimate how people can misuse features
<Sorella>	beaky: JS has always supported OOP
<zpartw>	I kind of think like this: "The language can be used this way. It is a way which I want to use it. So I will use it like that."
<deltab>	and if you mean class inheritance, it doesn't change that
<voltagex>	Sorella: macros?
<deltab>	(aIui)
<Sorella>	voltagex: macros. As in, "compile-time meta-programming for generating programs from existing programs." As in: http://sweetjs.org/
<voltagex>	Also, why can't every tutorial be as good as this, rcyr?
<zpartw>	I've never been able to understand why a library or whatever should necessarily have "private members" and stuff like that. As in you think that somebody with malicious intent has access to calling the library from the code and... ugh. It makes no sense to me to spend all that time "protecting" source code instead of the user simply using it properly.
<zpartw>	Is it for some perverse theoretical reason?
<voltagex>	zpartw: structure, no global variables etc
<preaction>	it's to protect the user from themselves, and to protect you from having to deal with support requests from users who are pointing a loaded gun at their foot
<Sorella>	zpartw: "private" is usually for enforcing contracts. Which I think is misguided.
<Sorella>	(not that enforcing contracts isn't a good thing, but the concept of private members as a way of enforcing those contracts is particularly misguided)
<zpartw>	:/
<beaky>	the dream would be if js supported monads. then u can lazily evaluate ajax services and stuff in a purely functional way
<Sorella>	beaky: monads don't require language support.
<Sorella>	>> Array.prototype.join = function(){ return this.reduce(function(a, b){ return a.concat(b) }, []) }; [1, 2, 3].map(function(a){ return [a - 0.5, a, a + 0.5] }).join() // <- a monad in JS
<ecmabot>	Sorella: (object) [0.5, 1, 1.5, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 2.5, 3, 3.5]
<beaky>	this way ajax calls will not need callback hell or broken promises: just do x <- ajax('www.api.com/x'); and compose stuff sequentially
<Sorella>	Well, it's missing unit, but you get the idea
<voltagex>	rcyr: thanks for that JS in 2015 video. Any other similar tutorials? That's one of the better JS tutorials I've seen - including expensive paid ones
<Sorella>	beaky: right, that's do syntax, which is not directly related to monads. JS might get those as generalised comprehensions in ES7.
<rcyr>	voltagex: Not that I know :)
<beaky>	wow when is es7 gonna come out
<Sorella>	beaky: at least two years from now.
<deltab>	zpartw: when people rely on undocumented internals, updating the library can cause their programs to break when those internals change
<k4r1m>	Does anybody have a clever way of mocking an offline connection by modifying XMLHttpRequest prototypes or some other solution?
<Sorella>	I've always seen `private` as a side-effect of languages with fields + methods, instead of just message sends. Though that might be mostly Java.
<falafel>	I see no point of private tbh
<voltagex>	k4r1m: I'd also be interested in that
<beaky>	yes if u have nothing to hide privacy ceases to be necesary
<falafel>	Object.defineProperties is enough IMO
<kr4sh>	if i have onclick="prof('+ snapshot.key() +')" .. how would i write my function prof() to read inside of it
<Sorella>	falafel: a[b] = c should've been enough
<deltab>	k4r1m: ServiceWorkers
<k4r1m>	deltab: looking for a standard way with good compatibility
<k4r1m>	Thanks thou
<falafel>	Sorella, not sure how "private" compiles in ES7-8 or whateva
<falafel>	maybe some combo of closures + defineProperties?
<falafel>	but JS is adding things I don't think are necessary, like decorators
<falafel>	isn't a decorator just a hof?
<preaction>	basically yes
<voltagex>	what the warn Timed out on lookup for github:ModuleLoader/es6-module-loader, retrying (1)
<Sorella>	falafel: decorators are nice, but I don't think JS needs them.
<falafel>	right, I think they have a place in Python for example, because the lambda syntax is meh
<Sorella>	They might come in handy with shorter forms though
<Agamemnus>	hello
<falafel>	I'd rather they add |> and <| to the language, a native performant curry that can inline functions, same with compose
<Sorella>	Like, `var foo = { @doc("bar") @category("qux") foo(){ ... } }`, instead of `var foo = { foo: doc("bar", category("qux", function(){ ... })) }`, but I don't see them as strictly necessary
<Sorella>	falafel: yeah, that'd be more general.
<Sorella>	The only reason Purr has decorators is that top-level stuff are declarations, so you can't use arbitrary expressions there.
*	Sorella sleeps
<zpartw>	What was Pixi.js's freenode channel?
<Agamemnus>	There isn't any. There's a phaser channel

<Agamemnus>	It's #phaserio
<rcyr>	Sorella: What time is it for you?
<zpartw>	Hmm.
<zpartw>	Wait... Why is Phaser related to Pixi.js?
<Sorella>	rcyr: 2am
<zpartw>	Isn't Phaser the one that just takes Pixi.js?
<Agamemnus>	phaser is an extension to pixi
<zpartw>	Not the other way around?
<Agamemnus>	Not a lot of people use pixi by itself.
<NBhosting>	sorry newbee question, when doing this http://fiddle.jshell.net/fy487pmq/
<NBhosting>	does that keep track of all the created checkers
<Agamemnus>	you shouldn't do that
<falafel>	NBhosting, you are just creating a variable and overriding it on the next line
<falafel>	plus you forgot `var`
<Agamemnus>	NBHosting, I have some time
<Agamemnus>	Let's talk
<NBhosting>	he mate
<NBhosting>	k
<zpartw>	Agamemnus: Why would I want the silliness from Phaser?
<Agamemnus>	I'm just saying
<Agamemnus>	There's no pixi channel
<Agamemnus>	That's all I'm saying
<Agamemnus>	you can use http://www.html5gamedevs.com/ to ask a question on the pixi subforum
<zpartw>	:(
<Agamemnus>	or ask me if you want
<zpartw>	It's at v3 now... but the documentation still seems to be heavily lacking.
<zpartw>	Sure, there is a minimal example, and some demos, but...
<zpartw>	It's really just... thrown at ya.
<Agamemnus>	okay
<Agamemnus>	find a corporate sponsor
<zpartw>	Hard to grasp.
<Agamemnus>	then
<zpartw>	What do you mean?
<Agamemnus>	have them hire me to do the docs
<zpartw>	I couldn't take people to leave a building on fire.
<zpartw>	*talk people into
<zpartw>	Bleh.
<Agamemnus>	hahaha
<xaxxon>	if I'm making my own methods on array, how do I change the elements in the array?  do I have to use the built-in methods to do it?
<rcyr>	?
<xaxxon>	say I want to make a method that removes the second element
<xaxxon>	actualy I was hopng to be able to create a new array and just assign the contents of that new array to the "this" array
<Agamemnus>	zpartw:
<Agamemnus>	I tried pixi 2
<Agamemnus>	lots of bugs
<Agamemnus>	fixed a lot
<Agamemnus>	one thing I hated was being forced to use their horrible Java syntax to have them accept a pull request
<ljharb>	xaxxon: do not ever do that
<Agamemnus>	not sure what pixi 3 will throw at me
<ljharb>	xaxxon: don't modify things you don't own, especially builtin prototypes.
<xaxxon>	but it's fun
<ljharb>	xaxxon: what you should do is make a *function* that takes an array, and returns a new one.
<ljharb>	it's also a horrible horrible thing to do that breaks the wev,
<ljharb>	*web
<Agamemnus>	DO IT
<Agamemnus>	MODIFY THEM
<xaxxon>	but prototype does it
<Agamemnus>	BREAK THE WEB
<xaxxon>	FUCK THE WEB
<ljharb>	xaxxon: and prototype is shit, and they stopped doing it.
<Agamemnus>	Give in to the dark side.
<xaxxon>	I was joking about prototype
<ljharb>	in ES6, you can subclass arrays, so you could make your own array. but nothing has it yet.
<xaxxon>	that's cool
<Agamemnus>	["forEach"].forEach (function (op) {NodeList.prototype[op] = HTMLCollection.prototype[op] = function (callback, thisArg) {return Array.prototype.slice.call(this)[op] (callback, thisArg)}})
<ljharb>	horrible idea.
<Agamemnus>	Awesome idea.
<Agamemnus>	(the only reason I used forEach there is to allow expansion)
<Agamemnus>	but you saw that code before
<Agamemnus>	anyway
<Agamemnus>	it really makes my code a lot simpler
<ljharb>	no it doesn't.
<Agamemnus>	instead of splicing my elements into an array i can just do elements.forEach
<ljharb>	you don't have to do that anyways
<ljharb>	Array.prototype.forEach.call
<Agamemnus>	Well that's what I'm trying to avoid
<ljharb>	it means your code is brittle, and will break if browsers add "forEach", say, that works differently from yours.
<ljharb>	why?
<ljharb>	that's javascript.
<Agamemnus>	Browsers are brittle anyhoo
<ljharb>	right. so why make them more so
<Agamemnus>	There's a weighing
<Agamemnus>	because the probability that that happens < my time saved in thinking and remembering Array.prototype.forEach....
<Agamemnus>	.slice(x).call
<Agamemnus>	or whatever it is
<ljharb>	if you can't remember stuff built into JS, then you need to learn it anyawys.
<ljharb>	* anyways
<Agamemnus>	I disagree
<ljharb>	but also, `var forEach = Function.call.bind(Array.prototype.forEach);` and then `forEach([], func)` or `forEach(nodeList, func)`
<ljharb>	problem solved
<ljharb>	your code is clean, and you haven't broken the web.
<Agamemnus>	It's a compromise that I don't savor.
<ljharb>	some compromises make you a bad person ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<Agamemnus>	But you're making one too
<ljharb>	how so
<Agamemnus>	forEach as a standalone function doesn't look very clean
<ljharb>	that's subjective
<Agamemnus>	x.forEach, looks much better
<ljharb>	imo it looks far cleaner than using it as a method.
<ljharb>	methods require "this". "this" is ugly, and brittle.
<Agamemnus>	and it is in line with the array function
<Agamemnus>	so it is pretty
<ljharb>	again, that's subjective.
<ljharb>	i think it's ugly. you think it's pretty.
<ljharb>	but "pretty" and "ugly" are irrelevant.
<Agamemnus>	I see
<ljharb>	the only things that matter are maintainable, readable, testable
<ljharb>	etc
<Agamemnus>	I think we're sometimes farther apart than Reagan and
<ljharb>	and "readable" and "pretty" aren't always the same.
<Agamemnus>	Li Xiannian :P
<ljharb>	quite an obscure reference
<Agamemnus>	wait i'm wrong
<Agamemnus>	wait
<Agamemnus>	was it Nixon or Reagan who opened up China?
<ljharb>	nixon iirc
<Agamemnus>	okay so then
<Agamemnus>	we're sometimes farther apart than Reagan and Mao Zedong
<Agamemnus>	SHIT
<Agamemnus>	we're sometimes farther apart than Nixon and Mao Zedong
<Agamemnus>	sometimes I feel like I'm on acid
<Agamemnus>	but
<Agamemnus>	You have to admit that if forEach were ever added to elements
<beaky>	what can i use to do DI in javascript
<Agamemnus>	it would be elements.forEach, not window.forEach (elements, func)
<ljharb>	i never said anything about window.forEach
<ljharb>	globals bad
<ljharb>	but yes, sure, it would be a method like that.
<ljharb>	so if you want it, go get them to add it to the spec.
<ljharb>	beaky: functions
<Agamemnus>	too much effort
<Agamemnus>	maybe later
<webdex>	Agamemnus, do you develop HTML mobile app games?
<Agamemnus>	yes
<Agamemnus>	mostly web games more than mobile
<webdex>	do you mind if i pm you to ask some questions?
<Agamemnus>	np
<zpartw>	What does the second parameter really do for .addEventListener?
<zpartw>	In clear English, that is.
<rcyr>	It's a function
<zpartw>	The MDN explanation doesn't make any sense to me.
<zpartw>	Um... no. The one after it.
<falafel>	useCapture?
<rcyr>	It's "third"
<rcyr>	You know... after "second"
<rcyr>	zpartw: http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html
<falafel>	it explains in the MDN -- "If true, useCapture indicates that the user wishes to initiate capture. After initiating capture, all events of the specified type will be dispatched to the registered listener before being dispatched to any EventTarget beneath it in the DOM tree. Events which are bubbling upward through the tree will not trigger a listener designated to use capture"
<zpartw>	Yes. Third.
<rcyr>	capturing is the stupid Netscape model that nobody cares.
<rcyr>	But read the article :)
<zpartw>	Yes. I've read that description, and it couldn't be more unclear.
<beaky>	i love javascript
<rcyr>	zpartw: Do you know what "bubbling" is?
<zpartw>	rcyr: Not in this context, no.
<Agamemnus>	okay
<rcyr>	zpartw: When you click on an element on a page, "click" is called on the clicked element... then its parent... grand parent... etc... until it reaches the root element
<zpartw>	Sure.
<falafel>	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7398290/unable-to-understand-usecapture-attribute-in-addeventlistener\
<rcyr>	zpartw: Bubbling is the Microsoft model.... Netscape wanted the opposite, they called it "capturing"
<zpartw>	Why does some of my code have ", true" for this? As if I had to do it for some reason in some context.
<Agamemnus>	yeash the description is not clear
<Agamemnus>	get rid of that
<rcyr>	zpartw: With capturing, when you click on something, the "click" event is called on the root... then on the grand parents of the elements, its parent.. and itself.
<zpartw>	So basically, it's "invertedEventCaptureOrder".
<Agamemnus>	the last param always has a default now
<zpartw>	Or invertedEventRunningOrder.
<rcyr>	zpartw: bubbling is the opposite of capturing
<Agamemnus>	eever since years ago
<Agamemnus>	isn't quirksmode.org kinda abandoned now
<Agamemnus>	it was good years ago
<rcyr>	Agamemnus: THe guy cried for help a year or two ago...
<zpartw>	Cried for help?
<rcyr>	Then he got sponsored and a lot of money from people companies
<Agamemnus>	the quirksmode guy?
<Agamemnus>	oh
<rcyr>	Agamemnus: http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2011/06/donation_drive.html
<Agamemnus>	and now what
<Agamemnus>	that's 4 years ago
<rcyr>	HMm
<Agamemnus>	a lot of the articles are still really old
<rcyr>	 there's might be a more recent one... or time passes really quickly.
<Agamemnus>	he couldn't keep up with the web
<Agamemnus>	:(
<zpartw>	"The problem is that I don’t really care about the desktop browsers any more. Sure, they have their differences, and sure, web developers run into them, but it’s all so marginal and trivial compared to the mobile browsers that I just can’t be bothered."
<zpartw>	What is this guy talking about?
<zpartw>	Marginal and trivial?
<Agamemnus>	he's right in a way
<zpartw>	Also, screw mobile devices.
<Agamemnus>	mobile browsers are a lot worse
<Agamemnus>	haha
<andrew39>	when are screen.width and screen.innerWidth resolved
<zpartw>	"Finally, if I do run all the tests the remarkable conclusion will be that all browsers support everything nowadays. Even IE? Yes, even IE. Yawn."
<zpartw>	This guy is living in a different world from me.
<Agamemnus>	probably best not to use screen.width
<zpartw>	And that was 4 years ago? Jeez...
<Agamemnus>	i just ignore ie
<rcyr>	zpartw: You haven't lived in a IE6 world.
<rcyr>	Or else, you'd know he's right.
<andrew39>	it seems that screen.width is not resolved till very late in the code by trying to output it to consle.
<andrew39>	but screen.innerWidth becomes available at the start of the script
<Agamemnus>	gnight
<cagedwisdom>	could someone answer a browserify or webpack question  for me? what am i doing wrong here: http://pastie.org/10180780
<RLa>	"in the browser"?
<RLa>	is that a console or what
<cagedwisdom>	i was just trying to be expressive in a way thats irc friendly
<RLa>	do you have correct require() calls and stuff like that
<cagedwisdom>	I have exactly what's in main.js
<RLa>	where is var lru = new StorageLRU(asyncify(localStorage));?
<cagedwisdom>	I typed it in the console
<RLa>	that's not how browserify works
<RLa>	rtfm
<cagedwisdom>	i rpotfm (part of)
<colin_>	hi
<cagedwisdom>	is there a way i can do what I want?
<RLa>	cagedwisdom, if you want to use stuff outside the module system, see browserify standalone option
<cagedwisdom>	thx
<NBhosting>	whats the correct way to add data to a element
<NBhosting>	checker_element.data = "{'player':'test'}"
<NBhosting>	checker_element.player = "test"
<NBhosting>	both dont work
<falafel>	NBhosting, what doesn't work? what are you trying to do exactly?
<falafel>	what is an "element" in this context?
<NBhosting>	element is a div element
<NBhosting>	i want to add a owner name to that div data
<NBhosting>	so i know later from who that div is
<falafel>	NBhosting, element.dataset.player = 'test'
<NBhosting>	thanks let me try that
<NBhosting>	thanks, that does it
<falafel>	!mdn dataset @ NBhosting
<ecmabot>	NBhosting: HTMLElement.dataset - Web API Interfaces | MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/dataset>
<falafel>	that's the documentation
<cagedwisdom>	RLa, adding --s or --standalone isn't helping the cause.
<cagedwisdom>	same error
<RLa>	you are not exporting anything from main

<pyCasso>	How can I pass a jquery ajax response into Angularjs controller?
<GreenJello>	pyCasso, ask in #angularjs
<deltab>	pyCasso: what does the controller expect?
<deltab>	if json and a GET request, use $.getJSON
<pyCasso>	the controller expects a json object
<pyCasso>	the json object is pulled in using $.ajax();
<pyCasso>	deltab: https://bpaste.net/show/cf9fbf8f1125
<deltab>	pyCasso: why are you using $.ajax?
<pyCasso>	I was using another templating library and Im playing around with angularjs
<deltab>	you can use $.getJSON instead
<deltab>	why are you using async: false?
<pyCasso>	you mentioned that before. Is that added within the controller scope or outside
<deltab>	is $ jquery?
<robdubya>	dont use async: false
<deltab>	no idea. ask in #angularjs
<Raynos>	Hi!
<Raynos>	anyone know of a type inference system for javascript? Other then tern.
<GreenJello>	tern is the best one written in JS and open source
<GreenJello>	flow is the best overall for good code, but it's in ocaml
<GreenJello>	Raynos ^
<Raynos>	Fair enough
<Raynos>	I've tried using flow and found it hard to use on my codebase
<Raynos>	So i'm working on writing my own (jsig)
<Raynos>	trying to see if there are any modules i can build on
<voltagex>	is anyone using jspm here? I'm trying to use babel but it's still trying to use traceur
<tejasmanohar>	falafel: are you here by any chance? having an issue with stylus/rupture/jeet
<falafel>	tejasmanohar, ya
<tejasmanohar>	falafel: yo
<tejasmanohar>	jade- https://30c5a81b.srvdir.net/app/views/register.jade
<tejasmanohar>	falafel: https://30c5a81b.srvdir.net/public/css/register.styl
<tejasmanohar>	look at http://2ab0b359.ngrok.io/ under low-width
<tejasmanohar>	(mobile, via chrome devtools)
<tejasmanohar>	and i cant get the do you wanna hack the lotto text centered
<tejasmanohar>	so it can look like https://www.dropbox.com/s/sqt73jk369g8x6q/MOBILE%3A%20Landing%20Page.png?dl=0
<tejasmanohar>	but im failing falafel
<tejasmanohar>	any ideas on this one?
<ashnur>	tejasmanohar: you have no text align on the text in low width
<falafel>	tejasmanohar, pff, not sure, these kind of things are hard to test, but to align things there are various ways
<tejasmanohar>	hm
<falafel>	tejasmanohar, first, I'd start with something like that http://dpaste.com/0VDXE13
<falafel>	so it centers things
<tejasmanohar>	move one dir up in the file structure i sent you
<falafel>	then, to center buttons, lists, etc, I usually just go with `text-align: center` and `display: inline-block`
<tejasmanohar>	and click style.styl
<tejasmanohar>	body background #F5F5F5 center(960px)
<falafel>	I'm not sure that's how it is suppose to work, I have not used it like that
<falafel>	I think you have to apply it to a block element
<falafel>	oh, that's supposed to be `body\nbackground #f5f5f5\ncenter(960px)
<tejasmanohar>	yes
<tejasmanohar>	thats what i meant
<falafel>	tejasmanohar, not sure, again, it is hard to get a demo for people to try with all the transpilation and such
<tejasmanohar>	ok sure
<falafel>	tejasmanohar, why are you using col(1/2)? I don't see the relationship with your elements
<tejasmanohar>	iFrame takes up the left 1/2
<tejasmanohar>	and callout div takes up right half
<tejasmanohar>	of content div
<falafel>	ah, but on mobile it has to stack?
<falafel>	tejasmanohar, why are you using this selector `& > iframe`?
<falafel>	and `& > h1`?
<tejasmanohar>	thats the same as > right?
<tejasmanohar>	in stylus falafel ?
<falafel>	yeah, why are you doing that?
<tejasmanohar>	because i want to get the child element?
<tejasmanohar>	https://www.dropbox.com/s/0gasjtrbgqslxpd/WEB%3A%20Landing%20Page.png?dl=0 - big screen
<tejasmanohar>	mobile screen https://www.dropbox.com/s/sqt73jk369g8x6q/MOBILE%3A%20Landing%20Page.png?dl=0
<falafel>	tejasmanohar, can't you just do that http://dpaste.com/3P7ENXK
<tejasmanohar>	im trying to implement these so yeah on mboile it stacks vertically
<tejasmanohar>	yea i guess
<tejasmanohar>	either works
<falafel>	also you apply the `col` to callout and ifram but you stack h1?
<falafel>	I'm not seeing this...
<tejasmanohar>	im not seeing this?
<falafel>	tejasmanohar, they are different selectors
<falafel>	yeah, I'm not seeing the layout in the code is what I mean
<falafel>	I'd write it differently I suppose
<tejasmanohar>	falafel: yes they are different but either works yea
<tejasmanohar>	yeah my css is bad
<tejasmanohar>	im trying hm
<tejasmanohar>	falafel: the web layout you see in code tho right? https://www.dropbox.com/s/0gasjtrbgqslxpd/WEB%3A%20Landing%20Page.png?dl=0
<tejasmanohar>	take a look at http://2ab0b359.ngrok.io/ now
<tejasmanohar>	but on small width, mobile web yeah i dont see the layout either- thats what im working on now O.o
<falafel>	it stacks...
<tejasmanohar>	falafel: in mobile it stacks, yes
<tejasmanohar>	maybe im misunderstanding stack()
<tejasmanohar>	the stacking of elements is what i suppose would happen
<tejasmanohar>	intended
<falafel>	I resize the browser and it stacks
<no_gravity>	is there something like substring(-4) in javascript to get the last 4 characters of a string?
<falafel>	no_gravity, yes, slice
<GreenJello>	.slice(-4)
<deltab>	>> 'a string'.slice(-4)
<no_gravity>	awesome, thanks
<ecmabot>	deltab: (string) 'ring'
<GreenJello>	>> 'foo bar'.slice(-4)
<ecmabot>	GreenJello: (string) ' bar'
<tejasmanohar>	falafel: i intended it to stack :)
<falafel>	tejasmanohar, I guess I dont understand what youre asking
<tejasmanohar>	"Do you want to #hackthelotto?" i wanted to make it centered horizontally
<tejasmanohar>	like in the deisgn
<tejasmanohar>	on ombile
<tejasmanohar>	https://www.dropbox.com/s/sqt73jk369g8x6q/MOBILE%3A%20Landing%20Page.png?dl=0
<tejasmanohar>	get what i mean?
<falafel>	tejasmanohar, try to add width: 100% to your header
<tejasmanohar>	i have https://gist.github.com/tejasmanohar/ceab3b33dba138c1d097 but no luck
<tejasmanohar>	ok one sec
<tejasmanohar>	.header
<tejasmanohar>	  width 100%
<falafel>	tejasmanohar, also I'm still unsure why you stack() h1, but col(1/2) on something else
<falafel>	the stack() is to clear cols
<falafel>	I think yours stacks naturally, and that stack isn't doing anything, I'm not sure, I haven't used it like that, I use stack() to stack previous col()
<tejasmanohar>	oh i see
<tejasmanohar>	yeah it does that naturally haha
<tejasmanohar>	i added width 100% to .header
*	oddskill_away is now known as oddskill
<tejasmanohar>	im more just confused how to get it to center horizontally
<tejasmanohar>	that do you wanna hack lotto text
<falafel>	tejasmanohar, that's harder to do
<tejasmanohar>	yeah
<tejasmanohar>	that was my initial question
<tejasmanohar>	badly worded
<tejasmanohar>	why wont text-align work there, falafel
<falafel>	tejasmanohar, use display: table on the parent, then display: table-cell on the child
<tejasmanohar>	table for thsi?
<falafel>	tejasmanohar, yeah, that's one way
<falafel>	it is not a table, you use the display attribute
<tejasmanohar>	parent meaning ah ok
<tejasmanohar>	*ah ok
<tejasmanohar>	now view is very weird on mobile falafel http://2ab0b359.ngrok.io/
<tejasmanohar>	kinda confused where youre going with this one falafel ?
<deltab>	why are you using table-cell? why not block?
<tejasmanohar>	are you aware how to do it using block deltab ?
<tejasmanohar>	is that an easier way?
<tejasmanohar>	i have not used table cell for this before
<falafel>	you can use transform: translate as wellk
<falafel>	there are various ways
<falafel>	just look vertical align css in google, it is not straight forward
<falafel>	there are like 6 different solutions depending on what you got
<deltab>	text-align: center on .content helps
<tejasmanohar>	ok hm
<DragonPunch>	is it okay to load scripts
<DragonPunch>	usin jquery
<deltab>	plus margin-left/right: auto
<deltab>	DragonPunch: yes, why not?
<DragonPunch>	okay
<tejasmanohar>	looking deltab
<tejasmanohar>	hm i think im getting closer but no hit yet http://2ab0b359.ngrok.io/
<deltab>	and take off float: left
<tejasmanohar>	deltab: hm?
<tejasmanohar>	float: left
<tejasmanohar>	i dont see that in my code deltab
<deltab>	from the iframe
<tejasmanohar>	probably inflicted by the grid system jeet
<tejasmanohar>	col(1/2)
<tejasmanohar>	deltab: so just float: none ?
<deltab>	register.css line 36
<tejasmanohar>	ooh but im using a preprocessor
<tejasmanohar>	https://gist.github.com/tejasmanohar/2918f26ab870004d6ab3
<tejasmanohar>	so prob from col(1/2)
<deltab>	yes, float: none
<tejasmanohar>	done
<falafel>	tejasmanohar, just gotta play with it a bit more I think, I can't suggest anything, but I doubt the problem is jeet, but rather the way you think it works
<falafel>	it took me sometime to get a nice workflow going
<deltab>	or put the col() bits in a +above(), if you can do that
<tejasmanohar>	falafel: problem is not jeet for sure
<tejasmanohar>	its def me
<tejasmanohar>	deltab: calc() bits in an above() to achieve what?
<tejasmanohar>	ik calc()
<tejasmanohar>	but like with what intent would i put calc() in there
<hub1dev>	hi
<hub1dev>	i have a really nasty problem, maybe somecan can help me
<hub1dev>	basically i get text from a comment box from a backend and I want to markdown parse it
<hub1dev>	when I get it I do the following
<hub1dev>	Escape possible html in the comment -> parse it with markdown
<hub1dev>	the only problem is ">" is markdown syntax for quotes, and it gets of course escaped by the html-escaping
<deltab>	why do you html escape?
<deltab>	markdown should handle that, afaik
<hub1dev>	it doesnt
<hub1dev>	i use marked .js
<deltab>	tejasmanohar: to only apply columns when the width is above a certain value
<hub1dev>	when i dont do html escaping and write <b> reger </b> in a comment
<hub1dev>	is is displayed bold
<deltab>	tejasmanohar: instead of always, then trying to undo them at narrower widths
<deltab>	hub1dev: is the comment box used for discussing html?
<hub1dev>	no
<deltab>	hub1dev: so is there a problem with <b> making text bold?
<hub1dev>	no
<hub1dev>	but users could write <script>
<hub1dev>	and inject javascript code into the comment box
<deltab>	have you checked whether they can?
<hub1dev>	yes
<hub1dev>	its possible when i just markdown parse it
<deltab>	that sounds like a bug in the markdown parser to me
<deltab>	hub1dev: ah, set the sanitize option to true
<hub1dev>	ah yes
<hub1dev>	nice
<hub1dev>	thanks
<redjuggler>	hey all, i'm trying to write a function to look at this map and check if any of the zones have changed from what they say, but i can't find the element in the dom. can someone take a look and help me find the element to check against?

<hub1dev>	i dont think so because at that point its not text anymore

<NikoZz>	any suggestions for js linting?
<night-owl>	eslint
<night-owl>	no idea about the canvases
<redjuggler>	what about reading the text right before it's drawn? could i intercept the event or something?

<xaxxon>	I wrote a chat server in meteor.  it's pretty cool, but there's no one there to help me test/celebrate :(  anyone want to go to zchat.meteor.com and try it out?it's very basic, but I'm proud of it .  (you have to log in and then hit "create account" but you don't have to do email validation or anything)
<redjuggler>	does alert stop js execution?
<xaxxon>	yes
<redjuggler>	can i do an alert style popup without stopping execution?
<xaxxon>	yes
<xaxxon>	but it's a lot harder
<redjuggler>	i just want to get the user's attention from another tab
<xaxxon>	a lot harder meaning that alert() is trivial and non-modal is non-trivial
<xaxxon>	it won't get their attention
<xaxxon>	does an alert flash the tab or something?
<xaxxon>	I don't think I've ever seen that
<redjuggler>	i thought it changes the activetab to the one that threw the alert
<xaxxon>	hrmm... testing
<xaxxon>	you're right
<xaxxon>	it does
<xaxxon>	I don't know what the set of operations are that cause the tab to change, but you'd have to find a built-in that does it - you can't do that on your own from javascript, I don't think
<redjuggler>	okay. thanks xaxxon
<GreenJello>	there's no way to emulate that in JS, but there are a lot of ways alerts are displayed in JS
<xaxxon>	there's no "switch to me" javascript... yeah what GJ said
<GreenJello>	here's one I like: http://fabien-d.github.io/alertify.js/
<GreenJello>	it's like alert, but less ugly, and has confirm/prompt variants also
<NikoZz>	my code works perfect in chrome but not in firefox.. is there a fast way to find out why??
<xaxxon>	magicjavascriptdebugger.com
<xaxxon>	no
<xaxxon>	if there were, we'd all be out of a job :)  browser incompatibility is job security
<xaxxon>	that's why we all code for IE6 still :)
<NikoZz>	:(
<NikoZz>	would js linting help?
<xaxxon>	maybe
<GreenJello>	NikoZz, start by opening the console and see if there are any errors
<NikoZz>	GreenJello yes there are..
<xaxxon>	...well then fix them?
<NikoZz>	its not that easy :P
<xaxxon>	not reaally sure what you were expecting
<GreenJello>	well that's step one, and then fixing the errors is step 2 :-)
<sanova>	hi
<NikoZz>	xaxxon: there are so many tools for everything, why not a compatibility checker? :|
<xaxxon>	I want one for C :)
<GreenJello>	NikoZz, the normal practice is automating compatibility with tools like autoprefixer and jquery
<GreenJello>	and then figuring out the rest; it's just part of web development
<sanova>	is there some way to catch the download end event (response from url) trigger by an <a href=url"> ?
<NikoZz>	GreenJello: Im new to js thats why Im asking :/
<NikoZz>	my mistake that I had to write 5000 lines before testing my app in firefox..
<sanova>	triggered*
<GreenJello>	NikoZz, the only important thing to know is how to use google
<GreenJello>	if you're running into a problem, 100 other people also have
<NikoZz>	yeap I do, but I prefer asking here the experts
<NikoZz>	sometimes not always
<NikoZz>	I am not afraid of asking a stupid question :)
<NikoZz>	how do you test your code in all browsers?
<NikoZz>	and in all versions of every browser?
<GreenJello>	there are tools to do it, but there's services like browserstack and saucelabs that help
<GreenJello>	karma lets you run unit tests on browsers locally
<NikoZz>	GreenJello: what development inveronment do you use?
<NikoZz>	I still use wamp.. :|
<GreenJello>	it depends, but usually something node.js based
*	colin_ is now known as cotalinux
<NikoZz>	are you a windows user?
<NikoZz>	or linux?
<GreenJello>	osx but I run some things in linux vms
<NikoZz>	why dont you use always the same environment? :|
<NikoZz>	it depends on what?
<GreenJello>	it depends on the project
<NikoZz>	more specifically?
<GreenJello>	at my previous job it was php+nginx; at this one it's node.js, some people work on django projects, or rails, and use a variety of databases, often multiple
<GreenJello>	'stacks' are generally bad, because you don't have the right tools for the job
<NikoZz>	GreenJello I always have a huge problem to decide which languages should i use
<NikoZz>	php node.js python?
<NikoZz>	I just dont know how to decide..
<GreenJello>	if you're just starting out, it doesn't matter too much because you're likely not working on something long term or something that's expected to serve many users
<NikoZz>	I started 7 months ago and I really believe that it is something that will serve many users..
<NikoZz>	anyways
<GreenJello>	but out of those three: python has the best ORMs, php is commonly used... good if you want easy/cheap hosting and cheap developers; node is great for real time applications and concurrency (e.g. make 5 requests at once)
<NikoZz>	I chose php because thats what I had used before
<NikoZz>	but then.. the next question was.. should I use a php framework??
<NikoZz>	and the story goes on and on..
<NikoZz>	and for the front end, should I use angular?
<NikoZz>	or ember?
<GreenJello>	yep, that's development; infinite questions, and few good answers that are hard to find
<NikoZz>	or none..
<NikoZz>	my biggest fear is that I will have to re-write the whole application
<NikoZz>	in a new framework or smth

<AnoyingJson>	but _json.isOk, and _json[isOk] is null
<AnoyingJson>	well after the json is parsed, and i print it - it shows the value
<AnoyingJson>	but i am unable to access the 'isOk' value
<_rgn>	_json[isOk] is wrong

<_rgn>	_json['isOk'] and _json.isOk are equivalent
<AnoyingJson>	yeah _rgn i figured so, just tried both approaches
<_rgn>	and var key='isOk'; _json[key]
<_rgn>	it's weird that you're getting null instead of undefined
<_rgn>	sounds like your json infact has nulls
<AnoyingJson>	_rgn exactly my thought
<AnoyingJson>	_rgn another value does contain null
<_rgn>	you need to post a runnable code example
<AnoyingJson>	gimme a sec :)

<asteele>	too many variables when using Ti.API.info(_json); AnoyingJson , does console.log() print the same thing ?

<nszceta>	*how do i fix this warning ^
<asteele>	hard to say then AnoyingJson , as far as i can tell that would be perfectly valid
<AnoyingJson>	asteele yeah even used a json validator to check the output of _json

<nszceta>	bower-config isn't a package in my packages.json
<GreenJello>	nszceta, it's problem with the bower package
<asteele>	probably a dependancy for a package that is in your packahes json then nszceta
<nszceta>	umm...
<AnoyingJson>	hmm i actually thing the json object is kinda messed up. i just printed out _json[0] which returned '{'
<asteele>	pretty sad a js framework would obscure away consoe llog so you cant use it
<AnoyingJson>	to be perfectly honest, im not sure if console.log would or wouldnt work
<AnoyingJson>	gonna try :)
<AnoyingJson>	console.log does work
<_rgn>	AnoyingJson: let's clear something up. JSON is text and the moment you parse it, it becomes and object, and is no longer JSON
<AnoyingJson>	_rgn ahh your right
<GreenJello>	nszceta, the error doesn't make sense though... bower@1.4.1 asks for bower-config 0.6
<AnoyingJson>	i cant wrap my head around why it doesnt work tho

<HarryMilnes>	What's the best way to edit properties of a CSS Class in Javascript without JQuery?
<Wraithan>	HarryMilnes: edit the properties of a css class? What do you mean by that. Do you mean what classes are on a DOM element or do you mean actually editing a css class from JS?
<HarryMilnes>	Say I have the class .Display and I want to change display: inline; to display: none; ?
<HarryMilnes>	I don't wanna do it by element because some elements with that class aren't already rendered
<Wraithan>	HarryMilnes: Typically you change what classes are on a DOM element instead of modifying the CSS class. You can use a selector to grab all elements with a given CSS class then apply a new class to them with element.classList.add('invisible')
<Wraithan>	I have no clue if you can modify the CSS from JS but it seems like a bad idea
<Wraithan>	Then again, I'm not a front end dev, I hide in the backend 99% of the time
<yansanmo>	the css rule api is quite bad

<Bibrolp>	i want to check inside an array object if the ID is allready exist how do i need to do this array output is like ; [ { ID: 'ID1',     Title: 'Title1' },   { ID: 'ID2',     Title: 'Title2' } ]
<ljharb>	Bibrolp: use Array#find
<ljharb>	!es6 shim @ Bibrolp
<ecmabot>	Bibrolp: Use https://www.npmjs.com/package/es6-shim to get every backwards-compatible feature of ES6 in every browser and node.js! It's heavily tested, comes with Promises, and requires the !es5-shim.
<yansanmo>	var id = 'ID2', isPresent = arr.some(function(a) { return a.ID === id; })
<Bibrolp>	ljharb: thats a whole plugin is there not a easier way to do this ?
<Wraithan>	ljharb: array#find is ES6 and not in all browsers.
<PigDude_>	Bibrolp: i guess the point is there are ways to use ES6 functions so you should
<ljharb>	Wraithan: hence the es6 shim, which puts it in all browsers
<Wraithan>	ah
<Wraithan>	I didn't see the shim part
<ljharb>	Bibrolp: by using the es6 shim, you'll get all the builtin API methods in the latest JS version, and that's the easiest way
<ljharb>	Bibrolp: otherwise you have to make the method yourself.
<ljharb>	Bibrolp: you could use "some"
<PigDude_>	Bibrolp: ES6 stuff has stabilized to the point where IMO not using it is just creating technical debt for yourself
<ljharb>	Bibrolp: like arr.some(function (item) { return item.id === 'ID1'; })
<yansanmo>	ljharb, I prefer ID2
<Bibrolp>	PigDude_: I'm not so good with the plugins learning mode
<Bibrolp>	ljharb: wat does that function do ?

<ljharb>	Bibrolp: you're using some wrong.
<ljharb>	Bibrolp: "some" returns a boolean, and the function you pass to it needs to return a boolean

<Bibrolp>	ljharb: I want add the new data inside the array if it doenst exist

<Bibrolp>	couldnt*
<ljharb>	ok i'm confused
<ljharb>	you have a bunch of items. all of them have IDs.
<ljharb>	if it doesn't have an ID, it's not the same kind of thing
<Bibrolp>	ljharb:  i get from the client side  a object looks like { ID: 'ID1',   Title: 'Title1' } now i want to save this into an array/object but i want to check it on the ID if the ID is not in the array/object than push it else show errror "it exists"
<ljharb>	Bibrolp: that's what i gave you. where "other" is that object, `if (!map[other.ID]) { map[other.ID] = other; } else { console.log('error'); }`
<ljharb>	not sure why it's "ID" instead of "id" but whatever
<Bibrolp>	ljharb: ah wait i also need to push title inside the map so map is the storage ?
<ljharb>	Bibrolp: a map is key to value. i'm using the id as the key, and the *entire item* as the value.
<ljharb>	the entire item has the id, and the title.
<Bibrolp>	ljharb: I'm confused I only see the ID if i do console log map
<ljharb>	Bibrolp: you may not be exploring the console properly. each object has a little triangle next to it, click it.
<ljharb>	make a jsfiddle
<Bibrolp>	ljharb: i have now this  var  item = {ID: data.ID};          map = data;         console.log(map);
<Bibrolp>	ljharb:  now I see the ID and title but everytime there is a new data it overwrites te old one
<ljharb>	no
<ljharb>	that's wrong.
<ljharb>	var item = {}; item[data.ID] = data
<ljharb>	like, literally the exact code i typed for you 3 times
<ljharb>	wait, i'm confused again
<ljharb>	if "data" is your object
<Bibrolp>	yes
<ljharb>	var map = {}; map[data.ID] = data
<ljharb>	^
<ljharb>	do that.
<Bibrolp>	ok done
<ljharb>	now console.log(map)
<ljharb>	and you should see all of it.
<Bibrolp>	:D

<Bibrolp>	ljharb: I see now how it works, final i have this if(!map[data.ID]) {             console.log("push new data")             map[data.ID] = data;         } else {             console.log("This allready exist!")         }
<Wraithan>	I look forward to the future where I can use Map in the newrelic agent
<ljharb>	Bibrolp: sure, that works.
<ljharb>	Wraithan: es6 shim, you can use it now ;-)
<ljharb>	Wraithan: every JS engine, including every node/iojs version, has ES5 bugs anyways, so everything will likely always need the shims
<ljharb>	(to be fair, the es5 bugs are down to a few Date edge cases usually)
<Wraithan>	ljharb: this is node side not browser side, and there are some map polyfils but they end up to be less efficient for most stuff
*	julian is now known as alamar
<amazingBirdman>	so guys is there an easy way to make sure my modules have loaded for a call WITHOUT using Browserify?  I dont want a rebuilder or to ahve to compile it  amnually all the time =/
<ljharb>	Wraithan: they're O(n) for objects when not natively available, that's true
<ljharb>	and yes, node side needs the shims too :-)
<ljharb>	amazingBirdman: nope, JS doesn't have native modules yet. use browserify.
<ljharb>	amazingBirdman: you can use something like watchify for local dev
<amazingBirdman>	or a timeout for 5 seconds
<amazingBirdman>	2 lines of code
<ljharb>	that's a horribly brittle way to do it. far worse than using a transpiler.
<amazingBirdman>	better then relying on a whole compiling proces sand wachify
<ljharb>	disagree.
<amazingBirdman>	but thanks for the headds up on wachify
<ljharb>	polling? that's amateur hour
<ljharb>	but sure, you can just use script tags
<ljharb>	but if you don't use a module loader tool, you'd have to manually write code in all your modules to make them available
<amazingBirdman>	only if i use a timeout
<ljharb>	so it'll end up being many lines per module.
<ljharb>	no, script tags mean it executes in order. no timeout needed.
<ljharb>	seriously, just use browserify.
<amazingBirdman>	no ljharb you miss the point
<ljharb>	what is the point
<amazingBirdman>	the scripts load data
<ljharb>	ok
<amazingBirdman>	hence the timeout reuirement
<ljharb>	that doesn't follow
<ljharb>	are they loading data, or loading JS
<ljharb>	data isn't code.
<amazingBirdman>	data
<ljharb>	ok so then you don't need a timeout, you need an ajax callback, or a promise
<amazingBirdman>	yep
<amazingBirdman>	i used them
<amazingBirdman>	spent a day on one method though, only seems to work with an async timeout
<amazingBirdman>	when i wire it up it fials though ill keep trying
<amazingBirdman>	thanks
<ljharb>	np
<ljharb>	so i still don't understand what browserify has to do with it. that's for loading JS code, which is different than loading data.
<amazingBirdman>	you have a point ljharb
<amazingBirdman>	amazingBirdman commends you on your point
<amazingBirdman>	kaawww kawww

<gtwy>	i have a div that is ".hidden"
<gtwy>	when i make it appear
<gtwy>	and then make it hidden again
<gtwy>	it leaves a gap
<gtwy>	how do i tell the elements to go back to how they were
<ljharb>	Renari: or, multiply by some power of 10, do integer math, and divide.
<ljharb>	gtwy: make a jsfiddle, a screenshot isn't that helpful
<gtwy>	ljharb: when you make a div hidden how do you force the other elements on the page to reformat themselves
<ljharb>	gtwy: but that looks like a problem with whatever code is managing that typeahead. are you using a lib?
<gtwy>	so that there isnt a gap
<ljharb>	if it's properly removed from the dom, they will
<NBhosting>	why does dropable return the console.log multiple times when i move the same stone a phew times to a line. it outputs more and more. only when i run my buildboard function  http://93.158.222.150/backgammon/25/
<gtwy>	i wrote the typeahead from scratch
<gtwy>	its just a <div> that contains a ul li list
<gtwy>	i set the div back to hidden
<gtwy>	and it vanishes, but the gap doesnt go away
<ljharb>	why?
<ljharb>	that wheel has already been invented hundreds of times, don't reinvent it
<gtwy>	ljharb: not sure how 2 lines of code really matter
<gtwy>	ljharb: im not here to argue with you, im looking for help on making a div hidden and all of the other elements rearrange themselves properly

<ljharb>	latestbot: "key-value pair" isn't a primitive, it's just a concept
<ljharb>	you can generate a random number or string, and use that as a key tho
<latestbot>	yeah, I want to do that

<juboba>	hey guys
<juboba>	don't get me wrong, I love the new ES6 spec, but I'm worried about this ObjectOriented aproach ES is taking...
<PigDude_>	juboba: yea, unseemly for an object-oriented language right
<ljharb>	juboba: we're not all guys here. this channel isn't the committee, why are you complaining here?
<juboba>	sorry dude
<juboba>	I'm just making conversation
<ljharb>	you also have no idea if i'm a dude or not.
<juboba>	it's not all about solving problems, you know?
<ljharb>	here it is.
<ljharb>	starting out with a complaint isn't making conversation, it's starting shit :-)
<PigDude_>	juboba: if you want good FP in the browser use ClojureScript, Elm or something :)
<ljharb>	you can do great functional stuff with JS already.
<ljharb>	and ES6 has tons of functional goodies.
<PigDude_>	and yea arrow functions in es6 definitely make it nicer
<ljharb>	including tco.
<juboba>	I've been using ES for years
<juboba>	I'm just sayin'
<PigDude_>	in general lots less writing the word "function" in your code w/ ES6 changes
<ljharb>	to what end
<juboba>	PigDude_: I agree
<PigDude_>	and yea tco is nice. and the new object-oriented facilities are nice too. not too many reasons for complaint
<juboba>	and I'm ES6-ready
<juboba>	but I think MAYBE
<PigDude_>	main thing is, backwards-compatible.
<PigDude_>	so there is little dilemma for adoption
<juboba>	newcomers will find the words 'class', 'interface', etc and MAYBE they'll be tempted to write code as Java
<juboba>	or something like that
<ljharb>	sure
<pi->	ljharb: "guys" is a non-genderspecific term, it is like "man/mankind". Taking offence to it is silly.
<ljharb>	but they already do that.
<ljharb>	pi-: no, it is gender-specific. don't start this debate.
<ljharb>	!guys @ pi-
<ecmabot>	pi-: The term "guys" may be a gender-neutral term to some people, but it is not to everybody. As such, please do not use it. Suggested alternatives: folks, people, team, y'all, everybody. https://subfictional.com/2012/07/02/language-matters-stop-using-guys-to-address-mix-gender-groups/ See !sexist
<PigDude_>	es6 has interfaces? i thought that was just a reserved word
<gtwy>	pi-: ljharb isnt here to help, hes here to argue
<ljharb>	PigDude_: it doesn't have interfaces, no.
<PigDude_>	ah it does
<gtwy>	pi-: just put him on ignore
<PigDude_>	no it doesn't :)
<ljharb>	gtwy: i did help you, but you haven't provided a jsfiddle.
<juboba>	I studied the Google Closure Tools and hated that they wrote everything to make Javascript like Java
<b4b>	i have a script that once in a while causes the browser to become unrepsonsive
<pi->	So someone has programmed the bot to agree with them?  Congratulations -- a good move!
<ljharb>	juboba: sure, because everything google makes is for java devs
<PigDude_>	juboba: google closure tools was state of the art for years
<b4b>	what’s the best way to debug this, once it happens the gui thread is non functional?
<gtwy>	i solved it, it was a css issue. i was bouncing an idea off to see if anyone else had problems with divs leaving a gap when they vanished. youre condescending and not helpful
<PigDude_>	juboba: it's no surprise that many es6 features copy closure tools features
<ljharb>	pi-: this is a community norm here. people are offended by it. you don't get to decide what others are offended by.
<PigDude_>	juboba: or that new popular tools like jspm and webpack copy closure tools features
<ljharb>	gtwy: glad to hear you figured it out. i was being condescending, because writing code for a solved problem is silly.
<ljharb>	PigDude_: they don't.
<ljharb>	google closure tools in advanced mode is dangerous, and without it, isn't anything new.
<juboba>	haha
<juboba>	right
<gtwy>	yes because someone has written the code to interface with our database to pull records from it? and to fill in all the necessary hidden fields with data (not just the "text" in the text box)
<PigDude_>	ljharb: what i mean is that the style of development encouraged in ES6 is quite similar to closure tools development in the large
<PigDude_>	ljharb: particularly wrt. modules
<juboba>	I think awesome things came from javascript because of its prototypal inheritance and stuff like that
<ljharb>	gtwy: someone has definitely written the code such that you can plug in your json endpoint url, and be done.
<ljharb>	PigDude_: closure tools didn't popularize modules, node did (commonJS and AMD were around before that, obv, but not as mainstream)
<ljharb>	gtwy: and any typeahead plugin will take a callback function so all you'd have to provide is your custom logic.
<PigDude_>	ljharb: well, you need to keep in mind that it was used internally for years before public release
<juboba>	PigDude_: what do you mean there are no interfaces?
<PigDude_>	ljharb: google has exerted its influence on es6 and es7 as part of its frontend dev strategy (there was that leaked paper a few years ago)
<ljharb>	PigDude_: "google used it internally" is an indictment, not praise, for anything non-java. because it'll be java-esque.
<juboba>	maybe not in the same way other languages uses them
<juboba>	wait
<ljharb>	juboba: JS doesn't have interfaces
<juboba>	oh my god
<juboba>	TypeScript made me think ES had interfaces
<gtwy>	its irrelevant to the question of "has anyone else encounted this issue." if you haven't, dont get into a debate about something else that isnt done "your way"
<juboba>	this is my first confusion with TypeScript
<juboba>	damn
<juboba>	sorry
<ljharb>	JS doesn't have types or interfaces.
<juboba>	yeah, TypeScript does
<ljharb>	gtwy: "a div won't hide" is so generic that nobody could possibly help without a jsfiddle. so i suggested you make one so we could help.
<pi->	Who else other than ljharb is offended by the use of "guys"? I've never come across this in 10 years on IRC. And I certainly haven't come across it in real life. I have operated in mixed-gender environments. It is just as common to hear a woman call a mixed group to attention group by saying 'guys!' as a man. I work as a teacher in Oxford, which is the origin of the benchmark for spoken English.
<ljharb>	pi-: any answers will be anecdotal. it only takes one person.
<ljharb>	gtwy: but also, realize that almost 100% of questions in here is someone thinking they know how to do something, and in fact it's the wrong approach.
<ljharb>	pi-: did you read the link in that factoid tho? because that's someone else.
<PigDude_>	i'm with pi-, in american english guys is gender-neutral
<ljharb>	it's not.
<ljharb>	even in the dictionary, it's both gender-neutral and gendered.
<PigDude_>	it is in familiar speech, and in absence of "gals" etc.
<ljharb>	and the *ambiguity* is why it's a problem.
<grubles>	off-topic?
<pi->	If someone is offended by this, it is their problem.
<ljharb>	grubles: it's not entirely off topic.
*	Havvy[Hex] is now known as Havvy

<gtwy>	pi-: the only time i dont use "guys" is when im talking to a group of women or of a strong woman majority
<gtwy>	but mixed / less than half women, guys is normal
<pi->	ljharb: I imagine I'm not the only one that finds your "language policing" offensive.

<zumba_ad_>	is this a good way of checking key if it exists? if (someObject.key === undefined) { .... }

<zomg>	:p
<ljharb>	zomg: good. that's the best irc channel.

<ecmabot>	Havvy: (object) [true, false]
<zumba_ad_>	Havvy: what is wrong with the way I'm checking it?
<zomg>	Can't say anything, maybe you accidentally say something wrong and then you end up on the shitlist
<pi->	ljharb: It is how you choose to behave. I am a member of this community, and I will have nothing to do with such silly language policing. Please don't speak on my behalf.
<zumba_ad_>	i wanted to make sure that a doesn't exist or empty
<ljharb>	pi-: i'm not. i'm speaking on the behalf of myself and others.
<ljharb>	pi-: language policing isn't silly, and that's how we operate here.
<Havvy>	zumba_ad_:  Then sure, `=== undefined` works.
<zumba_ad_>	>> var obj = {a : undefined }; console.log(obj)
<ecmabot>	zumba_ad_: undefined; Console: {a: undefined}
<zumba_ad_>	so === undefined is better?
<PigDude_>	ljharb: tbh ##javascript is and has always been one of the more permissive channels
<PigDude_>	ljharb: when i think of language policing i think of #python
<ljharb>	i know. that's why it's considered so problematic in the larger community.
<ljharb>	(the channel, i mean)
<PigDude_>	##javascript is considered problematic? o.O then i wonder what clj is considered
<ljharb>	just to illustrate: if you get banned from a JS irc channel and your real name is attached, you won't be allowed to attend any JS or node conferences.
<ljharb>	because that's how seriously the community takes it.
<pi->	ljharb: you said yourself, "guys" has both a gender specific meaning and a gender neutral meaning. If someone uses it on this channel, we should assume they imply the gender-neutral meaning.
<ljharb>	pi-: why?
<zumba_ad_>	>>  var obj = { a : "" }; if (obj.a === undefined) { console.log(true) }
<ecmabot>	zumba_ad_: undefined
<PigDude_>	ljharb: if conferences want to start banning people for saying "guys" in chat, ... ok
<zumba_ad_>	i want to test if it's either undefined or empty
<ljharb>	PigDude_: they have, and will continue to.
<PigDude_>	ljharb: as it stands i've got better ways to piss away my money or have my employer piss away money than to attend a javascript conference
<ljharb>	PigDude_: note it's not for "saying guys" it's for arguing that it's silly to be offended.
<zomg>	"if you get banned from a JS irc channel and your real name is attached"
<zomg>	just like that? :P
<zumba_ad_>	>>  var obj = { a : "" }; if (obj.a === undefined || obj.a.length > 0) { console.log(true) }
<ecmabot>	zumba_ad_: undefined
<pi->	I would like to know what is the perceived offence?  How might someone feel slighted by this word?
<PigDude_>	well my first name is Pig and my last name is Dude :p
<zomg>	the potential for abuse is pretty huge there...
<ljharb>	zomg: obviously it'd be verified
<zumba_ad_>	hmm, what is that not working
<ljharb>	zomg: you can't just claim to be joe smith and get joe banned :-p
<jParkton>	zomg: yeah JS developers are elitists like that
<zomg>	I think I might be banned from JS conferences in that case too since at least I was banned from #node.js because I said "watermelons"
<pi->	"if you get banned from a JS irc channel and your real name is attached, you won't be allowed to attend any JS or node conferences." <-- that sounds rather power hungry.
<ljharb>	zomg: it was more than that.

<pi->	ljharb: Trying to police the use of this word is going to no favours for women.  Last time I heard this discussion here, it was a woman saying "I do not want this word policed! I understand it to be gender non-specific. I am happy with this word." And someone quashed her, IIRC none other than you.
<PigDude_>	i think this channel should be a friendly place and that if somebody comes in with a casual question, they shouldn't get jumped on by busybodies

<PigDude_>	tejasmanohar: that's why you run that from the status window ;)
<jParkton>	yurp
<jParkton>	but whois is generally frowned on
<jParkton>	considered rude
<ljharb>	lol wat? no it's not
<tejasmanohar>	why
<Wraithan>	whois is a client->server command not client->client
<tejasmanohar>	i was just trying to see if theyre online
<PigDude_>	you can get a mask from freenode if you don't want that visible
<ljharb>	you can cloak your ip, sure, but the whois will still work
<jParkton>	falafel: you online?
<pi->	ljharb: If a woman is offended by this, they have some mental / psychological problem. A chip on their shoulder. It should be the responsibility of the community to encourage mental health. Not to encourage mental disease.
<jParkton>	also the whowas
<ljharb>	pi-: that's a pretty absurd claim.
<jParkton>	pi lol
<ljharb>	pi-: who are you to determine who has a medical problem, or what offenses matter?
<b4b>	everytime i look at this screen there’s an harb battle going on about ppl being offended
<jParkton>	I think what pi- means is some people will get offended over any damn thing regardless of the intentions of the person
<ljharb>	jParkton: then let that person be offended. that's never actually happened anyways.
<ljharb>	also, intentions are always irrelevant.
<Sorella>	pi-, PigDude_, jParkton: So, two things: (1) this channel tries to be welcoming to certain groups who are historically excluded from tech groups, such as women. Asking people to mind their language is one of the actions towards that (IOW, we're asking you to avoid subtle sexism, it's not that big of a deal). (2) You might find it silly, or anything, but
<Sorella>	discussing your opinion on it in the channel is not something we want here (you're free to PM ljharb on the subject, but you still won't get the rules changed). You're free to choose any other channel, of course, if you don't agree with our social rules.
<ljharb>	if i run over your cat, your cat is just as dead whether i did it on purpose or by accident.
<jParkton>	So how does it work if people saying ecma is offensive to me
<jParkton>	that doesn't matter because?
<kepta>	Hi
<ljharb>	well, because on its face that's a silly pedantic argument. but sure, if you can explain how a group of people are disenfranchised by it, i'd love to hear about it in pm
<Sorella>	pi-: also, that's blatant ableism. Please stop.
<jParkton>	I can get offended over really petty stuff, am I entitled to force compliance by eloquence and subtle injections?
<Wraithan>	ljharb: you see this? https://twitter.com/CookedKitfo/status/596767861537804288/photo/1
<ljharb>	yes ty i love that one :-)
<ljharb>	!thick skin @ Wraithan
<ecmabot>	Wraithan: http://twitter.com/GynoStar/status/583100951432544256/photo/1
<ljharb>	also ^
<Wraithan>	ljharb: also a good one
<Wraithan>	:)
<ljharb>	jParkton: please feel free to argue with me in PM about it if you really want.
<PigDude_>	Sorella: i don't think it's appropriate for you to single me out for this. i have no horse in this race, and ljharb and pi- are arguing. what bothered me was this OT harangue/discussion in reply to a casual message by a channel newcomer.
<jParkton>	I am not arguing, I am only asking but since you are already defensive and assumptive I doubt I would feel open to discussing it with you
<ljharb>	avoiding excluding people is never off topic.
<PigDude_>	Sorella: ##javascript is generally a friendly place and it suddenly felt quite judgmental
<jParkton>	which in fact hurts my feelings but that won't matter
<jParkton>	nahh Javascript is a good channel
<pi->	If I'm teaching English to a mixed class, and I say "guys, settle down!" and a woman or man takes offence, I will welcome the opportunity to educate, to say "actually 'guys' is an equivalent linguistic construct to 'people', so it is correct use of language."
<PigDude_>	Sorella: pi-'s waxing about how it's inappropriate for offense... etc. is another matter, that's plainly BS
<jParkton>	its filled with power trippers but that is understandable
<Sorella>	PigDude_: sorry if you think that making women feel more welcome in this channel makes it less friendly.
<asteele>	this si the only channel ive ever heard attempt to correct the usage of 'hey guys'
<ljharb>	pi-: how can you not see that that's equating "people" with "men", meaning "women aren't people"?
<jParkton>	I love womens!
<asteele>	and only ever from ljharb
<asteele>	never ever in real life
<jParkton>	I also recognize the fact that some women will feign being offended over the silliest little thing to get sympathy
<jParkton>	but that is logic which is unwanted
<Sorella>	PigDude_: language is not prescriptive, it's descriptive. People have all the rights to be offended by YOUR usage of a word, even if you think it means something else. Language changes over time because of that. See Ms. and Mx. added to English recently.
<Sorella>	Erm, pi- ^
<zap0>	i didn't know javascript was used in the kitchen!     is someone getting their panties in a twist about nothing ?
<ljharb>	sigh.
<jParkton>	oh lol
<jParkton>	kitchen.js
<jParkton>	fork it
<PigDude_>	Sorella: that's a pretty absurd statement.
<zomg>	people got pissy about penis.js or whatever that dumb library was called
<ljharb>	PigDude_: that's how linguistics works.
<zap0>	kitchen.js  isn't a bad name for a js lib...  most libs try to add everything under the sun.
<jParkton>	lets doit
<jParkton>	it returns an object with everything included even the kitchenSink
<PigDude_>	Sorella: what's the matter is the assumption that what was done makes *anybody* feel more welcome or comfortable
<Wraithan>	zap0: A) I use JS in my kitchen with some hardware for monitoring my oven. B) Seriously that aint ok.
<pi->	It is not going to do women any favours by requiring everyone to jump through an obviously absurd hoop. It will cause resentment. It will backfire. Consequently it will not make the world a better place.
*	Sorella has kicked zap0 from ##javascript (blatant sexism is not okay in this channel.)
<ljharb>	asteele: also the #node.js channel, from most all the ops.
<Sorella>	pi-: so, treating women as people is now considered a "favour"?
<asteele>	they also correct the usage of hey guys?
<b4b>	ljharb: how do you debug an unresponsive script problem when the browser hangs?
<jParkton>	asteele: lol
<ljharb>	asteele: much more strongly than here.
<PigDude_>	b4b: you don't. you try to get it not to hang
<asteele>	the internet is a funny palce
<ljharb>	b4b: remove all loops and recursion until it stops hanging
<jParkton>	er I mean Sorella lol
<ljharb>	asteele: it's in real life too.
<b4b>	damnit
<PigDude_>	b4b: you should be able to locate the source through logging
<ljharb>	asteele: that you've never heard it doesn't mean it doesn't happen.
<jParkton>	is there a js-offtopic?
<ljharb>	social stuff like this isn't offtopic. but no, not that i know of
<PigDude_>	i tried to make a #jslounge years ago, like #erlounge...
<pi->	Sorella: I don't expect to be treated as a man on IRC. I am a unit of consciousness. I don't expect any special treatment on account of my gender. I don't see your point.
<jParkton>	well it is getting people opscolded and kicked so I assume it is unwanted/offtopic
<ljharb>	pi-: that's all i'm asking for. remove gendered words so we can all do that.
<ljharb>	jParkton: ah you mean a place to argue about it?
<jParkton>	why do you always want to argue?
<asteele>	and every time it happens its sad as hell, you will never get rid of the term 'hey guys' and it IS A gender neutral term most of the time fomr the person saying it i believe
<pi->	The community is very clearly not in unison on this topic. So people with operator privileges "speaking on behalf of the community" is nonsensical at best.
<jParkton>	You need to open yourself up for discussions
<Sorella>	pi-: so, treating someone as a human being is a special treatment?
<jParkton>	molly coddling someone is
<ljharb>	asteele: eventually we will. lots of words evolve over time to be inappropriate. lots of ethnic slurs, for example.
<pi->	Sorella: Again, I can't see what you're getting at.
<ljharb>	lol what is "molly coddling"
<jParkton>	If someone gets offended why are they so pathetic they cannot speak up?
<ljharb>	looks like it's a really offensive way to describe someone because the definition comes from treating someone like a woman.
<jParkton>	why impliment policy on specific words because someone may possibly, someday eventually take offense
<PigDude_>	anyway i thought juboba had an interesting topic but it got buried
<ezakimak>	no one can give offense, only take it
<ljharb>	jParkton: everyone's opinion matters, even if they don't speak up.
<jParkton>	it sounds ignorant imo
<jParkton>	not mine
<PigDude_>	as nobody seemed to want to discuss OO in es6
<jParkton>	obvs
<asteele>	woman dont want to be treated like men
<Sorella>	pi-: "please, avoid using 'dudes/guys' as it excludes women, since it's perceived as gendered (and specially bad because tech is historically hostile to women)" "NOW WOMEN WANT SPECIAL TREATMENT FOR EVERYTHING"
<jParkton>	bullshit
<jParkton>	ask jih
<PigDude_>	(juboba being the source of the "guys" discussion too)
<jParkton>	only men know what offends women
<PigDude_>	jParkton: ...
<PigDude_>	jParkton: that's absurd
<jParkton>	hmmm is it?
<ezakimak>	"guys" has been gender neutral in the common vernacular for decades
<jParkton>	so who in here is a lady that is offended by people using a colloquialism
<Sorella>	ezakimak: "he" has also been gender neutral in the past century. Do you address women as "he"?
<iam>	http://jsfiddle.net/hvhj5hmt/ why does this have 2 alerts when you click on the sub parent?
<ezakimak>	the gender-specific "gals" is percieved as antiquated
<zomg>	Nigger was acceptable for decades too. Look at it now. Someone is probably going to get angry at me now just because I didn't censor myself when I wrote it :p
<jParkton>	you may not address them but you can refer to them as he
<ezakimak>	no, "they" as a gender-neutral singular article is back in vogue once again
<pi->	ljharb: but 'guys' is non-gendered. That is the common use of the word. It is used everywhere in this way. It does not matter if it also has a gendered usage. It is a reasonable form of address.
<ljharb>	iam: #jquery is a better place for that. but also, don't use alert
<jParkton>	is it really that offensive?
<ljharb>	pi-: you misunderstand. it doesn't matter if it has a genderless usage, if it has *any* gendered usage, it's not appropriate or reasonable.
<jParkton>	Am I supposed to be offended when someone refers to me as she? Or gals including me?
<jParkton>	how pathetic is that?
<Sorella>	pi-: again, language is not prescriptive. It isn't YOU who gets to tell people what "guys" means.
<iam>	ljharb: i asked jquery half an hour ago and they haven't given my anything useful :/ also i'm using alert for testing purposes
<asteele>	why does everyone have to accept your view of the world though
<ezakimak>	similar to "actor" displacing "actress". I've heard hundreds of females refer to themself and other females as "actors" in the last decade, "actress" is dead
<jParkton>	i am not that insecure
<ljharb>	jParkton: you're insulting a lot of people by calling them pathetic.
<iam>	as it pauses the code
<jParkton>	how so?
<ljharb>	iam: use the debugger for that imo, but ok
<ljharb>	jParkton: being offended isn't pathetic. not speaking up isn't pathetic.
<jParkton>	I say if you get offended by a word you are pathetic
<jParkton>	imo
<ljharb>	iam: it's because you have nested ".folder" items
<jParkton>	words only have the power you give them
<ljharb>	iam: and the click event propagates up the DOM
<asteele>	more than 50% of people would agree 'guys' is gender neutral, why does this channel have to conform to your view of the word (Which is very literal)
<ljharb>	jParkton: and it's not up to you what power someone gives a word for themselves.
<Wraithan>	asteele: that is an assumption with no data to back it up
<asteele>	ok i done
<jParkton>	it is up to you?
<jParkton>	Obviously
<ljharb>	jParkton: it is up to me to determine what offends me.
<jParkton>	but
<asteele>	true Wraithan , just a general guess from living in the real world and talking to real people
<ljharb>	jParkton: and it is up to you to determine what offends you.
<iam>	ljharb: how do i make it only effect the list element that is clicked?
<ljharb>	jParkton: and it is up to all of us to not knowingly offend anybody
<jParkton>	you are saying it is offensive to WOMEN
<jParkton>	not you
<jParkton>	I try
<ljharb>	iam: well, you could do `e.stopPropagation()`
<ljharb>	jParkton: it is offensive to me.
<jParkton>	but I will not walk on eggshells
<PigDude_>	jParkton: i don't see how the statement "only men know what is offensive to women" can be taken as anything but absurd. the source of the offense is ignorant of it? that makes no sense at all.
<ljharb>	jParkton: also to specific women that have messaged me many times and told me so.
<PigDude_>	jParkton: i thouhgt you were joking to be honest
<jParkton>	I was
<jParkton>	lol
<ljharb>	iam: where "e" is the first arg to the event handler
<jParkton>	</sarcasm?
<ljharb>	iam: but that's usually not a good idea.
<iam>	ljharb: what would be a better solution :P
<jParkton>	well I know ljharb is a male
<ljharb>	and how do you know that
<jParkton>	he is the one ready to chop off heads for using a colloquialism
<jParkton>	he is the one getting defensive
<asteele>	you would be wrong i believe
<ljharb>	iam: a better solution would be a single event handler on the root folder that uses event delegation to operate on any .folder clicks
<jParkton>	Ah
<jParkton>	at least I know
<ljharb>	i haven't identified my gender in here, so as far as you're all concerned, i have none.
<ezakimak>	https://gantsrants.wordpress.com/2012/08/22/guys-gals-grrls-and-other-slang-for-women-a-broad-analysis/
<asteele>	pretty sure you are female, right ?
<Sorella>	!sexism @ ezakimak
<jParkton>	idc
<iam>	ljharb: okay thanks i'll try that
<ljharb>	asteele: my gender's not relevant here.
<asteele>	you wont even answer?
<jParkton>	it is if you speak for the entire worlds population of that gender
<Sorella>	!guys @ ezakimak
<ecmabot>	ezakimak: The term "guys" may be a gender-neutral term to some people, but it is not to everybody. As such, please do not use it. Suggested alternatives: folks, people, team, y'all, everybody. https://subfictional.com/2012/07/02/language-matters-stop-using-guys-to-address-mix-gender-groups/ See !sexist
<ljharb>	jParkton: i'm not. i'm speaking for myself, and for the individuals that have indicated to me that it bothers them.
<PigDude_>	asteele: curiously while I'm part pig and all dude, it's mostly the pig stuff i take offense to.
<jParkton>	yall is offensive
<jParkton>	ah
<jParkton>	so why is it a room rule?
<PigDude_>	jParkton: by fiat, presumably
<pi->	Demanding people jump through the hoop of avoiding the word "guys" is counter-productive. Because it is a reasonable thing to say; challenging it will inevitably cause resentment. That resentment belongs aimed towards the one that challenged. But that's not the way people's minds work. Inevitably that resentment well turn against the women present. "Because of these women, someone is telling me how to behave".
<pi->	 I'm not saying that's a correct thought process. But it's probably an accurate one. As I said earlier, this policy backfires.
<jParkton>	isnt that the whole world conforming to what you and a couple of others are offended by
<pi->	It creates the opposite affect from that it intends to.
<ezakimak>	so who gets to decide who's vernacular is more important?
<jParkton>	indeed
<ezakimak>	isn't that culturist?
<jParkton>	it is
<ljharb>	"y'all" isn't offensive
<jParkton>	and conformist
<pi->	Rather than welcome women onto IRC, I am sure it is going to have the opposite affect by creating antagonism.
<jParkton>	yes it is when used by yanbkees
<jParkton>	and non southerners
<ljharb>	ezakimak: the common denominator of all the cultures, as best as can be achieved.
<ezakimak>	you can't live your life expecting no one anywhere will ever take offense.
<PigDude_>	ezakimak: what you're arguing is an ethnocentrist point of view
<ezakimak>	that's simply never going to be possible
<jParkton>	ezakimak: exactly
<ljharb>	no, but you can live your life trusting people when they say they're offended.
<ezakimak>	but that's their problem.
<asteele>	the @'s get to decide, obviously
<jParkton>	no not really
<ljharb>	no, it's not. that's a fucked up attitude.
<Sorella>	pi-: again, it's going to be policed here. If you have anything against that, you're free to choose a different channel
<jParkton>	some people you know... lie?
<buu>	pi-: That's a really good way to phrase that.
<buu>	And it creates really really stupid arguments.
<ezakimak>	what did PC ever achieve?
<ljharb>	lots.
<jParkton>	nothing
<buu>	ezakimak: Well they stopped calling people niggers.
<PigDude_>	ezakimak: political correctness is sort of the opposite of ethnocentricism, for better or worse
<buu>	So there's that.
<Sorella>	pi-: and that isn't true.
<jParkton>	only more hidden hatred
<PigDude_>	ezakimak: so you can't really expect them to coexist
<jParkton>	buu: that is bullshit
<buu>	No it isn't.
<jParkton>	people still call them niggers daily, even in music
<ezakimak>	i will not live my life guarding my tongue over trivialities
<ezakimak>	my life is too short
<buu>	jParkton: I didn't say *everyone*
<PigDude_>	oh. this discussion just went there .
<asteele>	this is fun :)
<jParkton>	you said "They"
<ezakimak>	i never intentionally say something hoping someone will take offense, but I don't worry about it either
<jParkton>	ezakimak: same
<jParkton>	if people are offended and too stupid to use /ignore how is that my fault?
<Sorella>	ezakimak: hmm, so if you unintentionally run over someone and kill them, there should be no consequences for you, obviously. That make sense, since it won't be your fault that the person was harmed, right?
<ezakimak>	that's not the same topic
<jParkton>	because saying 'dude' is the exact same thing as murder
<ezakimak>	straw man
<jParkton>	^
<Sorella>	No, I'm just making an analogy that "intent" matters when "harm" is being discussed.
<ezakimak>	i'm going to communicate using the common vernacular
<Sorella>	on whether intent matters*
<asteele>	lol and now 'guys' is 'harmful'
<ezakimak>	no, because someone taking offense can't be equated to harm
<Sorella>	ezakimak: and you're going to be harming people.
<zomg>	Actually intent matters in the example
<jParkton>	also yall when used by yankees and non southerns
<zomg>	because you'll either be tried for murder or manslaughter :p
<jParkton>	but that wont be enforced because I dont matter
<Sorella>	asteele: if you'd take a few seconds of your day to listen to women in tech, you'd know that the answer for that is "yes"
<buu>	I'm strongly considering adding a channel wide ban on arguments about the term guys.
<jParkton>	double standards?
<buu>	Because boy am I tired of it.
<jParkton>	yes remove all guys from JS
<buu>	Sure
<Sorella>	zomg: sure, the consequences you face differ, but you face consequences nonetheless
<jParkton>	no more men!
<asteele>	Sorella i dont listen to 'women in tech' because its pointless.  I listen to tech and if women are there then great
<buu>	We'll be left with goats.
<pi->	Sorella: Interesting that your first answer was to say "I am the person with the finger on the button. If you don't like it, go somewhere else."  And only your second answer says "but it isn't true". It looks as though you're not primarily looking at the logic of what I'm saying. To address what I'm saying isn't your primary response.
<jParkton>	So why is yall still acceptable?
<jParkton>	I have said it is offensive when used by a non southerner
<zomg>	buu: agree
<zomg>	I can live with it being banned but the arguments are annoying
<zomg>	:p
<Havvy>	jParkton:  I haven't seen anybody actually offended by "y'all".
<ezakimak>	to be complete "nigger" is not offensive when used by a dark-skinned person to another dark-skinned person
<jParkton>	I am
<buu>	oh god
<buu>	just shut up
<jParkton>	ezakimak: exactly
<zomg>	ezakimak: same as guys is not offensive when used by a man about another man ;)
<ezakimak>	so now we need full context of the sayer and listener
<jParkton>	Havvy: many southern people are offended when non southerners use it
*	ChanServ gives channel operator status to buu
*	buu sets ban on *!*@*
<buu>	Ok seriously
<buu>	I'm leaving this up for 30 seconds
<buu>	And when I remove it people better be talking about something else.
*	buu removes ban on *!*@*
<jParkton>	power trip much?
<ezakimak>	so we need a "unix" operating language
<jParkton>	lolwut ezakimak
<Brewster>	>_>
<jParkton>	isnt python kinda that?
<Wraithan>	Seriously, no reprocussions for the folks pushing it by mentioning the n-word?
<Wraithan>	jParkton and ezakimak both now at point.
<jParkton>	lets drop it before power trippers need to enforce internet law
<ezakimak>	you do realize the definition of quotes--it disassociates the author from the word
<AnotherLearner>	Hello. Is there an object-literal equivalent of pushing something onto an array in javascript?
<ezakimak>	there's array literal
<Havvy>	AnotherLearner:  There's no literal equivalent of `.push()`, no.
<buu>	AnotherLearner: What are you trying to accomplish?
<AnotherLearner>	ezakimak, Is an array literl like: [
<AnotherLearner>	{date: bla), name: "thing"}]?
<zomg>	js> var o = { }; Array.prototype.push.call(o, 'foo'); o
<ecmabot>	zomg: (object) {0: 'foo', length: 1}
<zomg>	of course.
<buu>	heh
<Havvy>	AnotherLearner:  Array literal syntax is `[expr, expr, ...]` yes.
<b4b>	bugs suck
<AnotherLearner>	Havvy, but you can't use .push() for an array literal right?
<Havvy>	zomg:  Interesting. I would have thought the array methods would fail is `length` wasn't defined.
<b4b>	they trigger when u dont want them and dont trigger when youre trying to find the root cause
<cjohnson>	AnotherLearner: seems pointless since you can just define it in the literal. but you could wrap it in parens
<zomg>	Havvy: I get the feeling the behavior could differ a lot between engines
*	pragma- is now known as Hexagon
<Havvy>	zomg:  I think it's something that'd be standard given how the array methods are defined in spec.
<Havvy>	AnotherLearner:  Can you show what you're trying to say?
*	Hexagon is now known as pragma-
<AnotherLearner>	buu, basically I want to push objects into a list. I switched my array to object literals but now .push() doesn't work. I don't know how to add objects to a list without knowing the index.
<PigDude_>	AnotherLearner: can you show the code that does this?
<AnotherLearner>	PigDude_, I dont really have code that works for pushing into an object literal. My code was working when I was using an array with array.push()
<cjohnson>	a list = an array?
<cjohnson>	or are you trying to abuse an object as an array?
<jParkton>	lol
<jParkton>	aboose
*	robotmayo is now known as zz_robotmayo
<AnotherLearner>	cjohnson, actually what I called list is a two-dimensional object literal. Yes, I was abusing an object as an array so I'm trying to figure out what the equivalent is for adding an "entry"/new pair to the object literal.
<cjohnson>	why not use an array?
<cjohnson>	objects as arrays make no sense. you lose the order, and all the array methods
<cjohnson>	perhaps you want a Map ?
<DragonPunch>	ew
<DragonPunch>	its PigDude_..
<Wraithan>	AnotherLearner: I'd favor composition, so I'd probably have an object that had all the behavors I need on it, that used an array internally. That is literally what I do when I need aggregators or pools.
<DragonPunch>	;)
<Havvy>	AnotherLearner:  As Wraithan said, I'd go with putting an array into your object and using methods on that.
<Havvy>	var obj = {namedProperty: true, array: [1, 2, 3]};
<Wraithan>	AnotherLearner: example: https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/blob/master/lib/reservoir.js
<AnotherLearner>	cjohnson, I was told to use an object literal to later be able to reference things with the property names
<cjohnson>	how so? your indexes are numbers anyway
<cjohnson>	you can do the same with an array. foo[1] is the same whether foo is an object or array
<Havvy>	AnotherLearner:  You can do both, as per my example.
<cjohnson>	yeah it sounds like you want an array in an object
<Havvy>	It just means that instead of doing `obj[1]`, it's `obj.array[1]`.
<PigDude_>	AnotherLearner: yea, i'm curious what you thought would work
<AnotherLearner>	OK. Thanks.
*	zz_robotmayo is now known as robotmayo
<SlashLife>	Not entirely sure about the actual context ... but wouldn't it make sense to use an object, even if you have numeric indices, if those indices are sparse?
<cjohnson>	you can have a sparse array I believe
<cjohnson>	>> var foo = new Array(5); foo[2] = 'foo-2';
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: (string) 'foo-2'
<cjohnson>	>> var foo = new Array(5); foo[2] = 'foo-2'; foo
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: (object) [undefined, undefined, 'foo-2', undefined, undefined]
<cjohnson>	oh, not sparse that's right. I dunno, I've never ever needed one
<j201_>	SlashLife: if you have numeric indices and you don't need in-order iteration, sure
<Impaloo>	What's the best way to implement efficient mapping & reverse mapping in the same object?
<AnotherLearner>	Is an ES6 map more than a two-dimensional array?
<Impaloo>	Like, look up by key, and look up by value
<matthavard>	I'm doing `document.body.webkitRequestFullScreen()` to full screen my site when the user presses F.  What I want is the same behavior as when the user presses f11 or Ctrl+Shift+F, but it appears that requestFullScreen takes away my ability to scroll an overflowing page, while f11/Ctrl+Shift+F does not.
<matthavard>	Cmd+Shift+F rather
<PigDude_>	Impaloo: if you want O(1) insertion, access you need to have two maps for that i believe
<PigDude_>	AnotherLearner: an es6 map isn't an array
<ljharb>	you don't want a sparse array
<ljharb>	those are very slow.
<Wraithan>	holes are :(
<SlashLife>	j201_: Oh, ok; I didn't have the in-order iteration on my mind, that's definitely an important thing (and logical, too, if you consider that it's most likely implemented using a hashmap.)
<ljharb>	right, array with holes === sparse array
<ljharb>	AnotherLearner: an ES6 map is just a map of key to value. there's no concept of "multi dimensional arrays" in JS except ones you make yourself with arrays of rows, or arrays of columns
<AnotherLearner>	ljharb, thanks.
<ljharb>	cjohnson: fwiw, it's insanely better to use an object with numeric keys than a sparse array
<ljharb>	arrays are best when they're simple lists of things, and you don't care about the specific indices beyond "the things are in order"
<deltab>	matthavard: try it on the html element instead
<Wraithan>	Event better if they are homogenous, at least for iteration purposes
<Wraithan>	s/event/even
<matthavard>	deltab: No luck
*	danillo10 is now known as Guest95744
<zpartw>	Can anyone in here think of a reason why I use ", true" in the end of this code snippet? I have a vague memory of it mattering somehow, but I didn't comment it...
<zpartw>	document.addEventListener("mousemove", function (e) { mouseX = e.clientX; mouseY = e.clientY; }, true);
<ljharb>	zpartw: that's the default if you omit it. it's "event bubbling" versus "event capturing"
<zpartw>	Yeah, but for some reason, I specifically entered it.
<zpartw>	I usually don't do things without a reason.
<buu>	zpartw: Because the documentation says not to rely on defaults?
<Wraithan>	zpartw: it isn't optional in ancient versions of firefox?
<deltab>	"Note: useCapture became optional only in more recent versions of the major browsers; for example, it was not optional prior to Firefox 6. You should provide this parameter for broadest compatibility."
<ljharb>	zpartw: yeah, it's better to always include it
<deltab>	also "If not specified, useCapture defaults to false." — MDN
<ljharb>	ah
*	oddskill_afk is now known as oddskill_away
<ljharb>	most people's browser support matrix doesn't include browsers with capturing tho
<ljharb>	still better to always provide it.
<Wraithan>	If anything for the monomorphism when calling to make the JIT happier :)
<Wraithan>	To go along with 'who knows what version that was standardized in and how many releases it was included in before it was fully standardized'
<zpartw>	Hmm... probably good points.
<zpartw>	To be honest, I still don't understand what it actually does. Or rather, I don't understand why it *matters*.
<zpartw>	But it clearly does in some situations, or else it wouldn't be an option.

<zpartw>	It was just a minor thing anyway.
<secrettriangle>	https://muut.com/riotjs/forum/#!/using:method-never-getting-called
<secrettriangle>	^ if any riotjs people can help
<iBeatBlaxx>	why do people still tell others that javascript is not java, isn't it obvoius?
<Pessimist>	because people are stupid?
<saberu>	anyone here got experience with javascript/html5 game dev?
<iBeatBlaxx>	Pessimist: i mean isn
<iBeatBlaxx>	if people are stupid, then how do they learn javascript?
<Sorella>	iBeatBlaxx: people still think that Node.js is a programming language. It's not hard to imagine how people would think that Java and JavaScript are the same thing.
<ljharb>	iBeatBlaxx: people aren't stupid just because they make a mistake.
<Sorella>	(Plus there's a lot of bad information on everything related to programming on the internet)
<AnotherLearner>	What would you call subtract in "moment(inputDate).subtract(1, 'days');"? Is it a function?
<Sorella>	And it isn't rare for you to see people saying things like "if loops," for example.
<iBeatBlaxx>	Sorella: i know node.js is a framework that was developed in javascript to send and receive data, but i am a really shitty programmer :(
<iBeatBlaxx>	i don't think i'm smart enough to program, i wish i was
<j201_>	AnotherLearner: yes. you could also call it a method, although you have to be careful with how people coming from other languages use the word
<AnotherLearner>	j201_, thanks.
<j201_>	(the official JS definition is a function that is a property of an object)
<iBeatBlaxx>	english j201_
<iBeatBlaxx>	that sounds like gibberish
<AnotherLearner>	So in "moment(inputDate).subtract(1, 'days');" is there a way I can pass a variable that represents either add or subtract like  "moment(inputDate).VARIABLE(1, 'days');"?
<pi->	iBeatBlaxx: "i don't think i'm smart enough to program, i wish i was" -- You could start by reprogramming that belief.
<Sorella>	![]  AnotherLearner
<Sorella>	![] @ AnotherLearner
<ecmabot>	AnotherLearner: foo.bar and foo["bar"] are both ways to access a property on a JavaScript object; use the latter when the property name is not a legal identifier (e.g. foo["my-cats"] or foo["emails[]"]) or when you need to construct the property name from a variable (e.g. var prop = "bar"; var x = foo[prop]).
<j201_>	iBeatBlaxx: well, i'm assuming that people know what `object` and `property` mean in a JS context. this is good reading for that kind of thing: http://es5.github.io/#x4.3
<iBeatBlaxx>	pi-: i try and try and continue to fail "simple" "algorithmic/math" scripts
<iBeatBlaxx>	thanks j201_
<Sorella>	iBeatBlaxx: I haven't met anyone who wasn't "smart enough" for programming. Mostly people just lack specific knowledge, have been taught wrong, have been taught correctly, but not in a way they feel comfortable learning, etc.
<AnotherLearner>	Sorella, thanks
<iBeatBlaxx>	what kind of math should i learn in order to program?
<iBeatBlaxx>	i feel like if i learned math i would be good
<Sorella>	iBeatBlaxx: none.
<iBeatBlaxx>	Sorella: well, how come i'm having problems with algorithmic challenges?
<mihod>	knowing math is always a good idea ;)
<iBeatBlaxx>	any time i see a number i freak out and fail the question
<Sorella>	(Unless you want to do functional programming, in which case you'll need to be able to solve simple equations, like `y = 3; x = y + 2`)
<iBeatBlaxx>	i want to do functional and object oriented programming
<Sorella>	iBeatBlaxx: algorithmic challenges don't test your programming knowledge
<iBeatBlaxx>	i want to develop a search feature
<iBeatBlaxx>	for my app
<iBeatBlaxx>	but that requires math :(
<mihod>	then you don't need math
<iBeatBlaxx>	mihod: i want to do it from "scratch"
<mihod>	Do you want to use it in production? Then it's a bad idea.
<mihod>	If you just want to learn a bit. Okay.
<pi->	iBeatBlaxx: make up a simple task, and figure out how to code it up.  http://pipad.org/ball/ball.html <-- that was my first JS program.  Don't just try and stock up pre-emptively on skills.  That's pathological.
<mihod>	However I guess, for Javascript there won't be much cases where you need math.
<AnotherLearner>	Sorella, so when I use ¨inputDate = moment(inputDate)['operation'](1, 'days');¨ I get a jhint error that it is better to use dot notation. Should I just ignore this error for this use case? Or is there logic behind in? Before I was using an if statement to switch between ¨add¨ and ¨subtract¨ but this seems more elegant.
<ljharb>	AnotherLearner: you should use .operation instead
<ljharb>	!bracket @ AnotherLearner
<ecmabot>	AnotherLearner: yourObject.foobar is just another way of saying yourObject['foobar']. So of course if varName = 'foobar', then it's also the same as yourObject[varName]. Dot notation is preferred to bracket notation except where the property name would be an invalid identifier. The same applies to quoting keys inside object literals - don't do it unless you have to.
<mihod>	Last time I really needed math for programming was when writting a CPU based renderer (as an assignment at university). However that's not what you want to do when you are in an ##javascript channel.
<Sorella>	Yeah, you want to use WebGL instead :P
<iBeatBlaxx>	what's a good paste code place?
<mihod>	http://sourcedrop.net/webapp
<AnotherLearner>	ljharb, the problem is that ´operation´ is not a valid method. Only add or subtract are. Does that mean it's better practice to use an if statement to see whether (operation === 'add')
<mihod>	(or GIST)
<Sorella>	iBeatBlaxx: if you want to develop an innovative search algorithm, you'll have to study *a lot* (including machine learning), and most of the things you'll find will require non-trivial amounts of calculus and other fields in maths. It'll also take a really long time to make that usable. But that's a research problem, unless you're in academia, you'll want
<Sorella>	to use what people have already written instead (like e.g.: Lucene)
<AnotherLearner>	In other words, is it bad practice to build a property from a variable like what sorella pasted above?
<Sorella>	AnotherLearner: var operation = 'subtract'; moment(inputDate)[operation](...)
<ljharb>	AnotherLearner: ahhh. you want [operation] not ['operation']
<ljharb>	AnotherLearner: note the variable, not the string.
<Sorella>	But, of course, that only works when both methods have the same signature
<mihod>	I totally agree with Sorella.
<iBeatBlaxx>	thanks Sorella i am going to try my best here
<iBeatBlaxx>	here's my first javascript program
<iBeatBlaxx>	http://sourcedrop.net/qTmfb3014809a
<AnotherLearner>	Sorella, ljharb, thanks!
<pi->	iBeatBlaxx: better to use something like jsbin that actually runs your code: http://jsbin.com/janeyepoku/1/
<iBeatBlaxx>	thanks pi-
<pi->	iBeatBlaxx: ok, so the code works.  But are you happy with it structurally?  How could one improve it?
<pi->	iBeatBlaxx: what if there were 1000 questions?
<iBeatBlaxx>	pi-: i just learned about functions today
<iBeatBlaxx>	:)
<pi->	ok, but you can go out of the other way. i.e. first figure out what you find inefficient about the code, and then go about figuring out whether there is some language construct that does what you want.
<pi->	So you might say "it's full of duplication. Duplication is bad, I would just like to stack up a list of questions and throw them into a QUIZ machine."
<pi->	" -> hmm, how do I store a bunch of strings?"
<iBeatBlaxx>	but what if i don't mind duplication?
<iBeatBlaxx>	what if i think making 100 lines of code looks better because it shows i'm having a lot more done?
<pi->	iBeatBlaxx: then you have come to the wrong place!
<iBeatBlaxx>	even though i could probably get away with writing a function that does this in 10 lines
<iBeatBlaxx>	but i hear that's what the joke is with java lol
<ljharb>	lol
<Agro>	not really
<ljharb>	anyone who thinks "more code" is "getting more done" doesn't know much about code
<pi->	iBeatBlaxx: `var strings = ['foo', 'bar', 'quux'];  for(var i=0; i<strings.length; i++) console.log( strings[i] );` -- that should give you some basic structure to work from.
<ljharb>	strings.forEach(function (string) { }) would be better tho
<pi->	ljharb: it's not about "knowing much about code". Someone with that mindset is thinking like a child.
<ljharb>	pi-: don't pick a fight with me for no reason.
<pi->	ljharb: yes, but consider you are dealing with someone that just made that statement.  I would first introduce the really simple stuff.
<ljharb>	loops aren't simple. that's the point.
<ljharb>	they're just traditionally taught first because that used to be all we had.
<Agro>	folds ftw
<saberu>	anyone here interested in a partnership/ JV project?
<ljharb>	iterations in general :-)
<Agro>	i havent written a loop in foreverf
<pi->	ljharb: I contradicted your statement because it didn't get to the nub of the issue. That's not picking a fight.
<ljharb>	i'm talking about the "thinking like a child" part. i'm still waiting for what it *is* about in your opinion tho.
<saberu>	anyone know the username of the guy who made this app? http://oss.sheetjs.com/ I know he used to idle here
<pi->	ljharb: oh. I see where the wire is crossed. I was referring to iBeatBlaxx's mindset, exposed by his statement. Not yours.
<ljharb>	ahh gotcha. no worries then, thanks for clarifying.
<tcsc>	how do i prevent right click on an element from opening the context menu? i'd like to intersept right click on a canvas to make it do something related to the game, but preventDefault in mousedown and click handlers don't seem to do it
<tcsc>	intercept*
<tcsc>	do I need to do it on the window mousedown/click?
<ljharb>	tcsc: there's a separate way to do it. but why do you want to? that's really rude.
<tcsc>	i mean, for a game i don't think it's that rude if the right click actually causes something to happen in the game, but if it makes you feel any better it's not on a user facing site, it's for the level editor
<ljharb>	fair on both points
<ljharb>	!mdn oncontextmenu @ tcsc
<ecmabot>	tcsc: GlobalEventHandlers.oncontextmenu - Web API Interfaces | MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers/oncontextmenu>
<javascript929>	Hello, I am trying to modify the value of an interactive search box using javascript, how can I signal to the web page that the contents have been modified?
<deltab>	javascript929: emit a change event?
<tcsc>	ljharb: awesome, that seems to do the trick
<tcsc>	yep, works like a charm.
<ljharb>	cool
<beaky>	hello
<javascript929>	okay, I have not used Jquery before, stackexchange says I use $(selector).trigger("change");
<foofin>	Hello!
<javascript929>	is selector the element id?
<beaky>	is it a bad practice to use transpilers like es6 or typescript or cljoruerscirt
<ezakimak>	i wouldn't call them bad practice, no. they are tools, and you're welcome to prefer to use them
<beaky>	i love tools
<ezakimak>	you may find less available help with some of them, however
<beaky>	esp that catches my erors at compile time rather than staring at a blank webpage  when i load it lol
<beaky>	oh
<ezakimak>	there's probably more help for es6 than the other two
<ezakimak>	clojurescript probably has it's own irc channel though
<pi->	iBeatBlaxx: from your statements, it is clear that your problem is attitude/mindset.  Until you change that, nobody here can help you.  That is what I meant by "you're in the wrong place".  I don't mean to discourage you.  By all means interact here.  But you need a mature outlook to be a software engineer.  The focus needs to be on producing clean reusable machinery, not "showing someone else how much I've do
<pi->	ne" or any other such nonsense.
<tcsc>	they're bad practice if the benefit you get from it is outweighted by the cost of using it.
<ezakimak>	and that's a valid, general assertion on any tool
<beaky>	in my case i guess the cost is a few more steps in gulpfilejs :D
<tcsc>	that's pretty minimal then
<ezakimak>	there is also cost in getting help if you need it
<iBeatBlaxx>	pi-: i didn't mean to show my code as "look at what i've done" i would love to learn software engineering, but i'm having a difficult time with the mathematics
<tcsc>	if the cost includes rewriting stuff into the new way, large project changes to support the build system, etc. it might be not worth using it.
<iBeatBlaxx>	and that joke was taken out of context, where people are saying that you can do 3 lines of c# or a hundred lines of java
<pi->	iBeatBlaxx: You'll find that once the mindset becomes healthy, the door to understanding opens. I have worked as a maths teacher for many years, and I've seen this door open time and again.
<beaky>	btw how do u guys debug js? when i load up bad scripts all i ever get a blank webpage and in js console some cryptic error message :(
<ezakimak>	use the dev tools
<iBeatBlaxx>	pi-: what would you say is the bare minimum for math for me to get the logic?
<ezakimak>	atm chrome is arguably the best environment, ff a near 2nd
<iBeatBlaxx>	what is the lowest level of math i should learn?
<beaky>	yeah i love chrome for playing with css
<ljharb>	iBeatBlaxx: calculus!
<javascript929>	In the console, after triggering a change, I get: Object[input#i_name.text_search.text.inactive_search property value = "myName" attribute value = "null"]. How do I change inactive_search to active?
<ljharb>	just in general, cause math is awesome
<pi->	iBeatBlaxx: ok, but if you are coming here for help don't throw jokes back! That's not what I am donating my time for. It's flippant.
<tcsc>	iBeatBlaxx: it depends. you need to know a lot of math for some things
<ezakimak>	depends on your needs. I'd always suggest go as far in math as you can stomach
<iBeatBlaxx>	thanks for your help pi-
<ezakimak>	i made it through diff eq
<ljharb>	javascript929: make a jsfiddle? not sure what debug output that is
<ezakimak>	which was quite interesting
<iBeatBlaxx>	tcsc: i would like to know enough to be successful at a programming bootcamp
<tcsc>	probably not much
<ezakimak>	never needed beyond calculus and linear algebra though
<tcsc>	if you wanted to do game development you would need a lot.
<pi->	iBeatBlaxx: there is no such thing as maths. There is just common sense building upon itself. Don't get lost on a false trail. Stick with your code example, it provides an interesting entry point.
<ezakimak>	basic boolean logic is important
<tcsc>	and algebra.
<ezakimak>	you can learn that in an hour though
<tcsc>	probably nothing much more than that though. a lot of code doesn't have much or any math in it.
<ezakimak>	binary representation may be useful also
<pi->	iBeatBlaxx: look at what I said earlier.  `var strings = ['foo', 'bar', 'quux'];  for(var i=0; i<strings.length; i++) console.log( strings[i] );` -- that was my suggestion.  Does that make any kind of sense to you?  Can you see why I'm suggesting that?
<javascript929>	ljharb: it's from firebug, I'm just using the console to test. A webpage has an interactive search box which I am trying to access via javascript. I used selector = searchbox_id ; textbox.value = "myName"; $(selector).trigger("change");. I can change the value in the search box but it does not search.
<ljharb>	javascript929: make a jsfiddle and i can look at it in my browser.
<iBeatBlaxx>	pi it doesn't make any sense to me
<iBeatBlaxx>	i'm off to learning, i hope i can do for others what you've all done for me today!
<pi->	And that would be precisely nothing.
<javascript929>	ljharb: Okay, I will. I have not made a jsfiddle before so I might take some time.
<nyanz>	math helps but its more about logic and abstraction, and a strong conceptual theory background on the language you use, practice helps a lot with this
<pi->	iBeatBlaxx: Try running it in your console.
<iBeatBlaxx>	nyanz: is there another way of obtaining that kind of mindset without practicing math?
<pi->	iBeatBlaxx: Maybe when you see the output you understand what it's doing.  Maybe you need to put "for statement javascript" into Google to gain a better understanding.
<cocomo>	hi, can I get the response headers from the normal request? like when enters mysite.com/ in addr bar. I want to access the response headers using javascript
<cocomo>	how i do that
<nyanz>	practice each concept you learn they build on each other so practice a lot before going to the next one
<nyanz>	that will help you, i have problems when not grasping something and trying to go beyond
<cocomo>	i want to get response headers from the response which actually loaded the page (or script itself) ? how can i acheive tht?
<pi->	iBeatBlaxx: it's right here and right now.  I'm offering to teach you the mindset you need to become a software engineer.  Let's work on your quiz game.  Clean it up.  Roll up your sleeves.  Get rid of the duplication.
<iBeatBlaxx>	thanks pi-
<deltab>	cocomo: I don't think that's possible; even with dev tools you have to reload the page to see them
<cocomo>	deltab: i want to tell the client access token how do i do that? i don't wanna use cookies.
<pi->	iBeatBlaxx: you need a hard head for this. If you wish to be a lumberjack you have to be able to lift some weight. It's a prerequisite. Same here. Some effort is required on your part. I want to see: can you put in the necessary effort to understand the code I wrote, or to ask a specific question?
<deltab>	cocomo: insert it into the page?
<pi->	biab
<iBeatBlaxx>	pi-: i'm running the code right now and i'm reading about javascript loops, which i haven't learned yet
<asdf12z_>	what's the javascript bot here?
<Havvy>	ecmabot
<cocomo>	deltab: i have my codes tucked away inside browsified functions it'd be pretty dirty writing inside those functions
<iBeatBlaxx>	and the thing in [] is an array right?
<asdf12z_>	>> 1 + 1
<ecmabot>	asdf12z_: (number) 2
<Havvy>	And babelbot.
<asdf12z_>	>> var a = new Array(); a['blah'] = 123; a['blah'];
<ecmabot>	asdf12z_: (number) 123
<cocomo>	iBeatBlaxx: [] is a square,
<asdf12z_>	so what are the implications of code like that?
<iBeatBlaxx>	a square?
<ljharb>	asdf12z_: don't use "new Array" ever
<ljharb>	asteele: the implications is that it's written by a former PHP dev, who is confused and thinks that arrays and objects are the same thing
<ljharb>	oops
<ljharb>	asdf12z_: the implications is that it's written by a former PHP dev, who is confused and thinks that arrays and objects are the same thing
<ljharb>	sorry, autocomplete
<asteele>	np
<ljharb>	asdf12z_: with non-numeric keys, you want `var a = {};` instead. also `a.blah`
<deltab>	asdf12z_: that adds a property to the array object, but it's not an element of the array
<lalaland1125>	asdf12z, Arrays  in js are objects, but I highly recommend against using them in that way.
<asdf12z_>	no i'm curious if that will lead to a crash eventually on say v8 engine
<ljharb>	asdf12z_: no
<ljharb>	asdf12z_: it's just subpar code
<lalaland1125>	It won't lead to a crash.
<lalaland1125>	The question is, is it valid code per the standard? Are property names reserved on Array?
<lalaland1125>	(Other than obvious cases like "length"
<javascript929>	On jsfiddle, how do I show another webpage? Say I want to test how my script interacts with www.google.com using jsfiddle, how do I display www.google.com in jsfiddle?
<asdf12z_>	i'm debugging some 3rd party code and i'm trying to figure out what's causing a crash, and i was wondering if it's that, though it's sandboxed v8 vms if that matters
<cocomo>	i heard js arrays are maps same as objects? is that true?
<Havvy>	cocomo:  From a theoretical perspective, yes.
<ljharb>	lalaland1125: it's totally valid. property names aren't reserved.
<Havvy>	From a practical perspective, arrays have a different underlying implementation that makes accessing 10 times faster.
<ljharb>	cocomo: no, that's not true, conceptually.
<Havvy>	Or was it 100?
<lalaland1125>	cocomo,  es5 js doesn't really have "maps"
<cocomo>	so can i do this ["hello": "there"]?
<ljharb>	no.
<Havvy>	cocomo:  No.
<ljharb>	cocomo: you can do `var a = []; a.hello = 'there'` tho.
<cocomo>	{1: hello}
<cocomo>	ljharb: oh nice
<deltab>	but don't
<asdf12z_>	you get crazy behaviour from it LOL
<asdf12z_>	>> var a = new Array(); a[0] = 1; a['123'] = 1; a
<ecmabot>	asdf12z_: (object) [1, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefi…
<asdf12z_>	see
<cocomo>	haha
<lalaland1125>	Cocomo, be careful. Only strings can be "keys" of maps.
<asdf12z_>	thinks there's like 123 elements
<lalaland1125>	Keys of objects*
<javascript929>	ljharb: how can I display www.google.com on jsfiddle to test how I interact with it?
<lalaland1125>	Oops
<pi->	iBeatBlaxx: yes. Have you figured out how to use the console on your web browser? For Chrome, it is here: http://pasteboard.co/mI9gOVG.png
<ljharb>	javascript929: you can't, you have to include your own html

<iBeatBlaxx>	are all plugins written in javascript?
<deltab>	javascript929: read the script, or in firefox click on the (ev) mark next to the element in the inspector
<lalaland1125>	Beaky, because jquery is for selecting dom nodes, not tables
<lalaland1125>	Blaxx, it depends on the browser
<sphetz_>	I am working with html 5 canvas and javascript and i want to use ctx.scale(2,2); with a value from a numberbox instead of 2,2  is this possible? so far  have tried var x = document.getElementById("num"); var y = document.getElementById("num"); ctx.scale(x,y);
<lalaland1125>	Oops, I thought you meant addons. Addons are sometimes js. Plugins are always native
<lalaland1125>	C/c++ or something.
<deltab>	sphetz_: you'll need to get the value from each element, and maybe also convert the strings to numbers
<sphetz_>	so add .value to the end?
<sphetz_>	i tried that but also didnt work but i will look at converting to string.
<sphetz_>	or number i meant
<javascript929>	deltab: Got it! The website wanted first a "focus" then a "click". Thanks!
<sphetz_>	deltab: does this look right? ctx.scale(parseInt(document.getElementById("num").value),parseInt(document.getElementById("num").value));
<tejasmanohar>	hey
<deltab>	sphetz_: yes, if you only want integers; but I'd do it in a separate line with a variable
<sphetz_>	seems like it should work but i am still having problems
<deltab>	sphetz_: console.log the number
<ezakimak>	you probably want to make sure you give ctx.scale numbers and not feed it NaNs
<sphetz_>	deltab: how would i use console.log() in this situation?
<sphetz_>	i am new to javascript
<ezakimak>	maybe add || 1 after each parseInt()
<ezakimak>	var x = document.getElementById("num").value; console.log(x);
<sphetz_>	then use f12 to check it?
<ezakimak>	sure, or you could just set a breakpoint and look at it in the debugger
<tejasmanohar>	i have a waiting list for my beta product and you get a ref link after signing up
<tejasmanohar>	and if you get people to signup from that ref link
<tejasmanohar>	you get in a higher spot in the waiting list
<tejasmanohar>	sorry, not a higher spot in the waiting list- but a prize every 5 referrals
<ezakimak>	are you offering to us, or providing context for a question?
<tejasmanohar>	im trying to prevent people from botting the system and getting a bunch of registrations on their ref link
<ezakimak>	ah. the latter
<tejasmanohar>	and i was thinking let X registrations from an IP; yes, ezakimak  :)
<tejasmanohar>	but then workplaces like Facebook with thousands of people under 1 IP could get screwed over
<sphetz_>	ezakimak: sorry, how do i check console.log?
<tejasmanohar>	sphetz_: from devtools
<ezakimak>	well, if you track the source ip and timestamp of each ref link usage, you could run it through a simple throttler algorithm
<tejasmanohar>	ah ok
<ezakimak>	sphetz_, open dev tools
<tejasmanohar>	ezakimak: do you have an example of this?
<tejasmanohar>	ezakimak: or something youd suggest googling...?
<ezakimak>	not off the top of my head, but some of the react examples show it
<tejasmanohar>	it can def be automated around but its better than nothing
<ezakimak>	it's the same idea as throttling a stream of events, grouping them into fewer, eg mouse clicks into double clicks
<tejasmanohar>	hm
<ezakimak>	or in your case, maybe even discarding after a threshold is hit
<tejasmanohar>	i see so like 5 requests in 2 minutes means ill just be like ok thats 1 request
<tejasmanohar>	yeah
<tejasmanohar>	discarding them if its too high because theyre spammers (most likely)
<ezakimak>	can you follow the final usage of each ref link, to know if they actually convert?
<tejasmanohar>	yes. thats the only time that i +1 the referrere
<tejasmanohar>	referrer
<ezakimak>	the more information you have the better decisions you can make
<ezakimak>	it might be quite specific to your problem domain
<tejasmanohar>	ezakimak: they go to mysite.com?ref=Id and then they fill out their phone number and submit the form and get their own ref link on the next page
<tejasmanohar>	ezakimak: yeah it kinda is
<tejasmanohar>	but since these are pretty popular, wondering what other sites do
<ezakimak>	you could also enforce a wait between reflink usage
<ezakimak>	in fact you might want to also do that anyways to prevent resource consumption
<ezakimak>	bbl8r, gl
<sphetz_>	what do i type in console?
<sphetz_>	ezakimak: what do is see in devtools do i have to type in console?
<beaky>	do js lambadas leak memory
<ljharb>	only when they dance to the wrong beat
<ljharb>	js, the forbidden language
<beaky>	.join angualrjs
<bprompt>	heheh
<ljharb>	beaky: no, JS lambdas do not leak memory inherently.
<ljharb>	since in JS, every function is a λ.
<beaky>	oh right
<Maxdamantus>	It's not a λ. λs don't have closure for one.
<ljharb>	oh, really? i didn't realize the definition prevented those
*	bprompt hands beaky  the turntable
<ljharb>	beaky: ok well in that case, JS doesn't have those, so it's just functions.
<beaky>	yes dont lambdas have free variables
<beaky>	oh
<Maxdamantus>	closures don't have free variables.
<Maxdamantus>	they're closed.
<beaky>	oh
<beaky>	i dont get it :(
<Maxdamantus>	in the LC, the simplest way to evaluate an application is to replace occurances of the parameter variable with the operand.
<Maxdamantus>	so `(\x. x x) (\y. \z. z)` becomes `(\y. \z. z) (\y. \z. z)`
<Maxdamantus>	You don't get to do that with closure, since variables can be modified.
<Maxdamantus>	if variables can't be modified, you don't need to think in terms of closure.
<beaky>	btw how do i know when to use "import x from 'module'" vs "import {x} from 'module'"
*	_X_C_V_B_ is now known as asqauredplusbsqa
*	asqauredplusbsqa is now known as a-sqaured-plus-b
<tarkus_>	(es6+,babel) Is there a way to deconstruct an array? E.g. let { 0 as name, 1 as domain } = 'john@example.com'.split('@')
<deltab>	beaky: that depends on the definition of the module
<beaky>	ah
<deltab>	tarkus_: [name, domain]
<Maxdamantus>	b> let [name, domain] = 'john@example.com'.split('@'); ({ name, domain });
<babelbot>	Maxdamantus: { name: 'john', domain: 'example.com' }
<Maxdamantus>	b> let { 0: name, 1: domain } = 'john@example.com'.split('@'); ({ name, domain });
<babelbot>	Maxdamantus: { name: 'john', domain: 'example.com' }
<beaky>	btw do es6 modules remove the need to wrap everything in IIFEs
<sphetz_>	deltab: i tried it with parseint and console.log and i get nan in console

<PHPLearner>	hello everyone
<PHPLearner>	I am a newbie to javascript
<PHPLearner>	I am still learning OOP javascript
<PHPLearner>	I am starting to write my own code
<PHPLearner>	I am reading a book also on Clean Code
<PHPLearner>	in that book I encountered that before proceeding to continue writing code you must test your existing code before building more on top of it
<PHPLearner>	the book also highlighted the importance of unit testing
<PHPLearner>	as a newbie who do I write a code that will test the functionality of my code
<PHPLearner>	anyone please point me to an online resource that I use thanks
<rcyr>	PHPLearner:What do you want to know?
<rcyr>	What's written in Clean Code is pretty much language agnostic.
<PHPLearner>	very simple
<PHPLearner>	say I have a function A and I want to learn how to automate a testing on function A
<PHPLearner>	of course in javascript
<rcyr>	PHPLearner: You use a test runner, jasmine and mocha are two popular ones.
<PHPLearner>	rcyr: can you point me to an online resource teaching how to run a test like that
<PHPLearner>	oh ok
<PHPLearner>	thanks
<rcyr>	Basically, they have a "watcher" that is going to rerun the tests everytime you make a change
<PHPLearner>	rcyr: oh ok
<PHPLearner>	I thought I needed to come up with my own code for testing simple functions I created myself
<PHPLearner>	rcyr: but just for curiosity though
<PHPLearner>	do you know of an online resource that teaches how to write code to test your own codes in javascript
<rcyr>	You're still the one writing the tests... a runner only executes your tests
<rcyr>	PHPLearner: Testing is mostly language agnostic... also, there are multiple types of testing
<PHPLearner>	rcyr: so you mean I do not have to write my code to test my the codes that I write
<rcyr>	I don't know how you came to that conclusion.
<PHPLearner>	so those jasmine and mocha are ready for that
<rcyr>	jasmine and mocha are runners. nothing else.
<PHPLearner>	oh ok
<rcyr>	You still have to do all the testing yourself.
<PHPLearner>	yeah but can those two things you mentioned automate the testing for me
<rcyr>	No, not at all. Testing is very manual unless you use a language like haskell where things like quickcheck exists.
<rcyr>	The runner allows you to have setup/teardown for each test, it allows tests to depend on others.. etc
<forQuery>	does anyone know how much try catch blocks actually slow down your javascript?
<forQuery>	im getting a "not optimized error" with jshint
<Literphor>	PHPLearner You have to write the code that gives values to your function and check if the return value is what you expect. A testing framework does the heavy lifting of giving you an easier to use API that will help you evaluate if the value returned by your function is correct
<rcyr>	forQuery: It depends on how big the functions is...
*	welly[work][away is now known as welly[work]
<rcyr>	forQuery: An unoptimized function won't be slow if it does nothing.
<Literphor>	PHPLearner So you create the test, you give it the answers and the framework runs it all, evaluates the result of each test and gives you the final score
<rcyr>	forQuery: (Seems kind of obvious...) have you looked at the "optimization killers" article?
<rcyr>	forQuery: https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/wiki/Optimization-killers
<Literphor>	forQuery I don’t think a try/catch block will have any overhead really. All it does is run some code if an exception is encountered
<Literphor>	Just looks ugly
<rcyr>	Literphor: For V8, a function have try/catch won't be optimized.
<rcyr>	*having
<rcyr>	But seriously... if you're optimizing at that level... I hope you have something working.
<PHPLearner>	ok
<PHPLearner>	so you are saying that I need to how to use jasmine and mocha
<Literphor>	rcryr Well… some many basic functionality seems to be unoptimizable in V8. Not something I see myself trying anytime soon then :-/
<hetii>	Q: How I can get from ['foo', 'bar' ,'nx'], [1,2,3] -> {foo:1, bar:2, nx:3} ?
<rcyr>	Literphor: Most code doesn't need to be optimized
<rcyr>	hetii: With .map
<Literphor>	rcryc But at least it’s not a ‘Likely never going to be optimized’…
<rcyr>	hetii: Hmm, nevermind, you need reduce
<hetii>	well the keys aray is static for all data entry, so suppose can use map also
<rcyr>	js> var x = ['foo', 'bar' ,'nx'], y = [1,2,3]; x.reduce(function(acc, v, i) { acc[v] = y[i]; return acc; }, {});
<ecmabot>	rcyr: (object) {bar: 2, foo: 1, nx: 3}
<forQuery>	for this, do you need the wrapping anonymus function?  onresize_end: function () { CHTML.resize(arguments); }
<Literphor>	rcyr I disagree … most code is pretty terrible. I expect the language itself to be optimized to litigate the damage of bad programmers
*	SirCmpwn is now known as SirCmpwnTest
<rcyr>	Literphor: I don't think any compiler can optimize "stupidity" :/
*	SirCmpwnTest is now known as SirCmpwn
<tcsc>	most of the things in that article (includeing the workarounds provided) aren't things you should be doing if you're trying to write fast code anyway.
<rcyr>	forQuery: You could do: onresize_end: CHTML.resize.bind(CHTML)
<Literphor>	But a simple try/catch block? let and const being used inside a function?!?!
<Literphor>	Come now
<rcyr>	Literphor: That article is a little bit old so... some of it is probably "wrong" now
<preaction>	it's hard to optimize a function when you can be thrown out of an unknowable number of stack frames
<tcsc>	well, let and const will probably eventually be optimizable
<Literphor>	I hope so
<rcyr>	tcsc: I hope... I mean, "var" is useless in a ES6 world.
<tcsc>	and try/catch/throw/etc are slow in every language
<tcsc>	rcyr: at least, they will if they're used
<ljharb>	rcyr: well, let/const are abysmally slow and will be for some time. so var will still be useful :-)
<rcyr>	I started using ES6 and 95%+ of my vat declarations are "const"
<rcyr>	*var
<tcsc>	why? if it's inside a function why would you care if someone reassigns to it?
<rcyr>	let is only useful for mutable code... and I avoid that kind of code as much as possible.
<ljharb>	tcsc: it's in case you, or another dev, accidentally reassign to it.
<tcsc>	right, but if it's local to the function it's very unlikely to matter
<ljharb>	tcsc: basically, always assume that tomorrow, you're going to show up and forget you were the one that wrote the code
<ljharb>	tcsc: if that's so, then marking it with "const" guarantees that.
<ljharb>	"unlikely to matter" isn't as good as "can't matter" :-)
<rcyr>	tcsc: I always try to write my code to be "stupid programmer safe"
<rcyr>	And sometimes, I can be the stupid programmer..
<tcsc>	my experience is that that is more trouble than its worth
<forQuery>	thank you rcyr, onresize_end: CHTML.resize.bind(CHTML) seems much smooother
<ljharb>	tcsc: that's very surprising. how do you think that'd be more trouble?
<tcsc>	it depends on the situation. with const instead of let you're probably going to find yourself repeating tests a lot, when multiple variables are dependant on a single test
<tcsc>	generally though you see people stuff like null checking every argument, etc which is just a waste of time
<tcsc>	c++ programmers have been using const for years, using it inside a function body only ever results in annoyance when someone later has to change it to non-const because theres a new condition. it doesn't add any robustness
<rcyr>	Not my experience, const-correctness creates better code unless you don't understand it.
<tcsc>	this is different from const correctness
<tcsc>	this is like slapping const on primitives because nobody happens to modify them
<tcsc>	JS's const isn't transitive so const correctness is sort of moot
<IronD>	Is this channel noob friendly?
<rcyr>	IronD: Yes.
<IronD>	oh great!
<IronD>	Does reader.result (text file) have anything that can read the file line by line? Or does it just spit out the contents as one huge string?
<ljharb>	IronD: is this a node question?
<rcyr>	IronD: What is "reader" in this context?
<IronD>	No this is pure javascript
<IronD>	erm
<rcyr>	IronD: Is it a FileReader? Something node related?
<IronD>	reader api
<ljharb>	in a browser?
<ljharb>	ah ok
<IronD>	ill link
<IronD>	hold on
<ljharb>	!mdn filereader
<ecmabot>	ljharb: FileReader - Web API Interfaces | MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader>
<ljharb>	no need
<ljharb>	looks like you just read it as one blob, and then you'd split it yourself.
<rcyr>	IronD: It should be a single string but you could .split it
<ljharb>	altho the array buffer works too
<IronD>	Well I am attempting to split but am having problems
<rcyr>	Which is?
<IronD>	this gives me some confidence, Ill give it one more crack and come back with the code if I am unable to
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	var canvas = document.createElement("canvas"); // Doing this once... is it even meaningful to delete the object? It won't be visible to the user and takes virtually 0 CPU cycles?
<rcyr>	mmmmmmmmmmmm: Garbage collection, love it.
<IronD>	Great!Thanks a lot guys, I just got it to split each line at the /r at the end
<IronD>	thanks so much for confirming for me!
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	rcyr: Doesn't really answer my question, thouhh. :/
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	*though
<rcyr>	mmmmmmmmmmmm: You never delete anything in JS.
<rcyr>	Except when you want to remove a key from an object....
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	rcyr: In this case, it's a DOM object after all.
<rcyr>	But you do so to remove the key/value and not to free memory
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	Or when you need to clear an array of objects.
<FernandoBasso>	When a function is returned like `return function() { return 'foo'; }; is the returned function an expression?
<falafel>	FernandoBasso, yes, you can only return expressions
<FernandoBasso>	All right, thanks.
<tejasmanohar>	anyone here familiar with mongoose?
<beaky>	hello
<foofin>	Hello!
<beaky>	is it bad to put commas in the begiining vs in the end
<preaction>	no. it's just stupid
<ljharb>	comma first is gross
<rcyr>	beaky: It's just a matter of style.
<rcyr>	beaky: Whatever you pick, be consistent.
<Sorella>	Comma-first all the things!!11!!
<beaky>	my sql is all comma in the beginning, so my javascript is too :D
<Sorella>	It's interesting that this kind of discussion doesn't happen in Lisps, because you don't have commas there :P
<Sorella>	Makes things much simpler
<cjohnson>	mmmmmmmmmmmm: it will be cleaned up as soon as you stop referencing it via GC, no need to manually delete it
<cjohnson>	just declare it in the scope that you operate on it so it will be cleaned up when that scope ends
<FernandoBasso>	falafel: Can't I also return values?
<FernandoBasso>	I'm lost in terminology, I guess.
<cjohnson>	an expression is something that is evaluated for a value basically
<ljharb>	FernandoBasso: an expression produces a value
<ljharb>	beaky: ew, comma-first sql is gross too
<FernandoBasso>	What if I do `return 10;` ? is 10 an expression?
<ljharb>	FernandoBasso: yep
<FernandoBasso>	It looks like a literal value to me.
<ljharb>	literals are expressions that produce values.
<tcsc>	literals are expressions
<FernandoBasso>	OK.
<ljharb>	ie `10` produces a primitive of type number, whose value is 10.
<FernandoBasso>	OK. Thanks.
<cjohnson>	I can never remember what isn't an expression. just the statements, right? which means "if" and "while" and "function" and a few other things
<cjohnson>	everything is either expression or statement? or is there more
<tcsc>	well there are declarations also
<tcsc>	like `var a`
<cjohnson>	I think that's still a statement tho when it's just var a;
<tcsc>	*shrug* it's a bit wishy-washy.
<j201_>	cjohnson: the spec calls everything a statement (expressions form parts of statements) EXCEPT for function declarations
<cjohnson>	hrm ok
<j201_>	which is a bit weird, and i think if you used the word 'statement' to include them, nobody would mind
<cjohnson>	what about var foo = function foo(){ }
<j201_>	that's a VariableStatement
<cjohnson>	yeah but the function itself... would it be an expression
<cjohnson>	or a function declaration
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	Is there some other motif behind garbage collection other than "allowing sloppy code"?
*	xiinotulp is now known as plutoniix
<cjohnson>	it's not about sloppy code, it's about not having to have a billion lines of explicit boilerplate mmmmmmmmmmmm
<preaction>	not having to manually manage memory, which is a bug factory
<cjohnson>	it would be insane to have to do all that stuff by hand
<j201_>	cjohnson: i mean something like statement; function foo() { ... } otherStatement;
<tcsc>	mmmmmmmmmmmm: no
<j201_>	in that case, it's a different beast
<preaction>	how many major security breaches can be directly traced to "failure to properly manage memory"?
<j201_>	but a function expression is just an expression
<cjohnson>	j201_: right, my example was "var foo = function foo(){};"
<cjohnson>	is it the "function foo" that makes it a declaration?
<cjohnson>	or just a lack of anything to the left or right
<preaction>	no. "var" already started a statement
<cjohnson>	because for instance, var foo = function bar() {
<cjohnson>	it has the behavior of an expression
<j201_>	cjohnson: a function declaration only occurs when `function` is the first token in a statement
<cjohnson>	where bar is immutably bound inside the function body
<cjohnson>	alright cool
<cjohnson>	makes sense
*	MichD is now known as michd
<j201_>	even (function foo() { ... }); is an expression, not a function declaration
<cjohnson>	right
<cjohnson>	iifE
<cjohnson>	er
<cjohnson>	I guess it's not ii
<cjohnson>	but still fE
<j201_>	(although i guess i shouldn't put it that way since technically a function declaration isn't a statement :P
<j201_>	)
<cjohnson>	ok so there was a convo a while back about var foo = function foo and we decided that for all but 1% of rare edge cases where you need to immutably bind the name for recursion, it was pointless to do so and you should just function foo(){}
<firevulpes>	Hey can someone help me with this really simple problem I'm having? https://jsfiddle.net/y2kos0pf/1/
<cjohnson>	but what about obj methods. {foo: function foo() {}}
<j201_>	cjohnson: i imagine that's more a matter of whether you like function hoisting or not
<cjohnson>	the general consensus is that the declaration is better, but here's an expression, so you get none of hte benefits, EXCEPT stack trace (and even then I'm not sure?)
<cjohnson>	ignoring hoisting
<firevulpes>	All I'm trying to do is have it so that if you check one box the other unchecks and vice versa
<preaction>	firevulpes: isn't that what radio buttons are for?
<cjohnson>	^
<npn>	var t = { count: 10, page: 1, sorting: { name: 'desc' } }; How do I get 'name' i.e. the key, not the value
<cjohnson>	you can get an array of an object's keys with Object.keys
<cjohnson>	but that screams of bad data design if you don't know the keys in advance npn
<firevulpes>	Surely it's an easy thing to code if I want checkboxes instead?
<npn>	You're right. Ty
<cjohnson>	why would you use checkboxes when a radio button is exactly what you want?
<cjohnson>	and doesn't require any code at all
<j201_>	npn: you'd probably be better off having { count: 10, page: 1, sorting: { by: 'name', order: 'desc' } }
<Wraithan>	cjohnson: there are other things like cpu and memory profilers that rely on naming things by function name
<cjohnson>	ok so profiling and stack tracing. they wouldn't derive the name from the object though?
<firevulpes>	I know I could use radio buttons but this problem is bugging me because I know it's so simple
<cjohnson>	or in the case of var foo = obj.bar; foo(); it would just be called foo. maybe that's not ideal
<cjohnson>	ok I see the merit
<cjohnson>	firevulpes: open your console
<cjohnson>	read the errors
<cjohnson>	fix them
<Wraithan>	cjohnson: depends on the profiler, and just because a function is bound to an object doesn't mean you are calling it that way
<cjohnson>	Wraithan: yeah but if you were, it would have the name of the var pointing to it
<cjohnson>	I just mean that it'd never be anonymous in that case
<Wraithan>	cjohnson: maybe?
<cjohnson>	well how else might it be?
<cjohnson>	{foo: function() {}} how might you call this anonymously
<cjohnson>	var bar = obj.foo; // has name of bar
<cjohnson>	obj.foo() // has name of obj.foo
<Wraithan>	cjohnson: people commonly hand off things to be used as a callback, which means your callback will be anonymous or named the value of the arg they are passed into
<tcsc>	(obj.foo)()?
<cjohnson>	I think it would be smart enough to print obj.foo but good point tcsc
<Wraithan>	cjohnson: would having 3/4ths of your callbacks be literally called 'callback' make them more or less useful :)
<cjohnson>	wrapping in parns doesn't change the reference
<cjohnson>	Wraithan: fair enough. but so let's say it's foo: function foo() {} ... and then you pass it as a callback
<cjohnson>	wont' it show up in the stack trace as the callback name anyway
<cjohnson>	firevulpes: but seriously just use radio buttons. it has a lot of little nuances and behaviors built in that you would be ignoring or recreating by hand to abuse checkboxes as radio buttons
<Wraithan>	because of function foo, yes. If you passed it just as obj.foo and had assigned an anonymous function to it, it would depend heavily on the engine whether it will or can name it correctly.
<cjohnson>	I'm thinkin it would at least be called "cb" in the latter case
<cjohnson>	but I'm curious if it would also be cb even if it were function foo
<cjohnson>	meaning: foo: function foo(){} may not even be helpful anyway unless you're calling it directly in the form of obj.foo()
<Wraithan>	cjohnson: also depends on if you are talking stack trace or profiling, they can use different mechanisms
<cjohnson>	in which case it already has the name
<cjohnson>	ah good point
<cjohnson>	I'll have to mess around with it
<cjohnson>	just trying to decide if I should adopt function foo(){} for object methods or if it will not give me any added value anyway
<Wraithan>	I thought stacktrace used Function.name as the first case in spidermonkey and v8
<cjohnson>	I'm already giving up var foo = function (and can't remember why I ever adoptd it)
<firevulpes>	cjohnson: How do you tie the radio buttons together? (I never work with HTML elements, only ASP.NET)
<cjohnson>	oh I think I didn't like the idea of hoisting
<cjohnson>	firevulpes: same name
<YouTubeAPI>	So I'm using my own data-sets now, and when I try to access them I get: Cannot read property 'parent' of undefined
<cjohnson>	and then you use differing values to deterine which was checked
<YouTubeAPI>	This is my JS: var e = $(".tab") alert(e.dataset.parent);
<YouTubeAPI>	The alert isn't going off at all.
<cjohnson>	e.dataset doesn't exist then YouTubeAPI
<cjohnson>	how are you defining it
<preaction>	what's "e" in that situation? jquery doesn't return html elements or collections, it returns its own things
<YouTubeAPI>	I'm just following this doc: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_data_attributes
<tcsc>	i don't think the potential debugging benefit of blah.foo = function foo() {} is going to outweigh how much of a pain it is
<j201_>	cjohnson: yeah, i guess some people find it too magic. i prefer it because it i like to think of functions as definitions that are independent of the order of execution, but that does clash with how other thing in js work
<cjohnson>	oh, hrm
<tcsc>	because i dont think theres any real benefit
<cjohnson>	YouTubeAPI: you're using jquery you can just use .data('parent')
<tejasmanohar>	https://gist.github.com/tejasmanohar/c585591c3af3ba6f2c23
<cjohnson>	e.data('parent')
<tejasmanohar>	im getting the error cant set headers after they are sent
<cjohnson>	and that will read data-parent
<tejasmanohar>	so there is a double callback() somewhere that is causing res.json twice i suppose
<cjohnson>	tsumetai: there definitely is -- stacktraces that are readable
<tejasmanohar>	WAIT no im stupid i forgot to delete something
<cjohnson>	and same with profiling
<cjohnson>	j201_: I don't use it for hoisting, in fact that's why I used var now that I think of it
<cjohnson>	I think the hoisting thing is silly
<YouTubeAPI>	cjohnson: What do you mean?
<cjohnson>	but I've never been bitten by accidentally using a function too early and I'm good about making sure I use it in the order it shows up in code anyway so I'm fine with going back to function foo
<cjohnson>	YouTubeAPI: about what
<cjohnson>	did you read the next line I wrote
<cjohnson>	tcsc: there definitely is -- stacktraces that are readable. as well as profiling
<cjohnson>	that's a major benefit, and there's very very little downside
<cjohnson>	in fact I can make it so when I type X: function in my editor, it completes it with " X"
<cjohnson>	no work necessary
<cjohnson>	YouTubeAPI: if you wanted to use the .dataset property though, to answer your question, you would have to call it on the actual node itself. not the jquery collection
<cjohnson>	so e.get(0).dataset (or e[0].dataset)
<cjohnson>	jquery objects aren't references to the underlying node
<tcsc>	hm, not sure i've had too much trouble with stack traces or profiling, but i also probably don't do as much JS as most people here
<fattest>	not sure if right topic, but for storing data, do cookies store data on the server or your local machine?
<Wraithan>	cjohnson: variable hoisting is a terrible idea, function hoisting is pretty rad though
<cjohnson>	stored on your machine, sent to the server with every request fattest
<cjohnson>	Wraithan: I prefer not to use any hoisting at all. It leads to confusion imo
<cjohnson>	I'd rather be able to read the code top-down and know that it works in that order
<cjohnson>	anything that might result in my having to jump back and forth when reading code is something I avoid
<cjohnson>	so my solution is just to be sure I only ever call a function after it's declared, even if I could technically call before
<Wraithan>	cjohnson: what about stuff that is defined in another module?
<cjohnson>	then it should come in through the import/require system
<cjohnson>	explicitly
<Wraithan>	I treat hoisted functions the same way, the name, if it is really important, I'll jump to definition. Otherwise the name is enough for me to keep reading and then I can get down to the actual definition
<Wraithan>	I'm not a big fan of inline closures though
<Ytapi>	Sorry, my connection timed out
<cjohnson>	20:06 < cjohnson> YouTubeAPI: you're using jquery you can just use e.data('parent') -- that will read data-parent attribute
<cjohnson>	20:10 < cjohnson> YouTubeAPI: if you wanted to use the .dataset property though, to answer your question, you would have to call it on the actual node itself. not the jquery collection
<cjohnson>	20:10 < cjohnson> so e.get(0).dataset (or e[0].dataset)
<cjohnson>	20:10 < cjohnson> jquery objects aren't references to the underlying node
<ghostchilli>	I've got a line that runs down my page. How would I recolor a portion of the line as the page is scrolled?
<Wraithan>	ghostchilli: make the line 2 different lines, where one moves over to obscure the other is the hack that I would do as a backend engineer that shouldn't be trusted with the front end
<ghostchilli>	Hah, that's a great suggestion. I'll look into it.
<tcsc>	theres always canvas
<cjohnson>	I would yeah use a node that contians 2 lines and you resize the 2 segments as you scroll to the sizes you want
<cjohnson>	such that they always add up to the full height
<tejasmanohar>	https://gist.github.com/tejasmanohar/22c7df41b42c336a2037#file-gistfile1-js-L72
<tejasmanohar>	console.log(typeof selectUser) prints object
<tejasmanohar>	console.log(selectUser) prints nothing
<tejasmanohar>	i want to find out some details about whats in this variable... how do i do this?
<cjohnson>	it prints "nothing"?
<cjohnson>	or it prints null
<cjohnson>	>> typeof null
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: (string) 'object'
<cjohnson>	because null's typeof is object
<tcsc>	you could put a debugger statement right before and just take a look in the debugger
<tejasmanohar>	o
<ghostchilli>	I guess the best visualisation of it would be imagining a fuse on TNT, as you scroll down the page, the fuse burns. IE, always at 33%vh or so
<tcsc>	oh wait this is probably node
<cjohnson>	ghostchilli: yeah the segments thing is how I'd do that
<tcsc>	nfc how well node debuggers work.
<beaky>	whats the best way to communicate between react components
<beaky>	e.g. forms
<tejasmanohar>	>> null === null
<ecmabot>	tejasmanohar: (boolean) true
<tejasmanohar>	ok so thats normal
<ghostchilli>	Is there a way to target pixels of a certain color?
<beaky>	>> undefined === undefined
<ecmabot>	beaky: (boolean) true
<beaky>	wow undefined is undefined
<tejasmanohar>	>> selectUser; selectUser===null
<ecmabot>	tejasmanohar: ReferenceError: selectUser is not defined
<tejasmanohar>	>> selectUser; selectUser == 'undefined'
<ecmabot>	tejasmanohar: ReferenceError: selectUser is not defined
<tejasmanohar>	>> selectUser; tyepof selectUser == 'undefined'
<ecmabot>	tejasmanohar: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
<tejasmanohar>	idk
<tejasmanohar>	i have a ;
<tejasmanohar>	>> var selectUser; typeof selectUser == 'undefined'
<ecmabot>	tejasmanohar: (boolean) true
<tejasmanohar>	i dont know what a semicolon had to do with that but ok
<cjohnson>	it's the lack of var
<tejasmanohar>	yeah i got that
<cjohnson>	you were trying to use a variable selectUser without ever having defined it
<tejasmanohar>	ah i see
<tejasmanohar>	thank you
<cjohnson>	ghostchilli: target pixels? the DOM doesn't even have a concept of pixels
<cjohnson>	are you talking about in images?
<ghostchilli>	A single black SVG line running down a page. The top 33% of it gets recolored as page scrolls.
<cjohnson>	why would you use svg for something that simple CSS can accomplish?
<cjohnson>	do you have an example or a starting point that you currently have?
<ghostchilli>	One sec
<tcsc>	ghostchilli: what do you want to do?
<tcsc>	for a small area you could probably do it using the pixel manipulation stuff in 2d canvas, for a large area you could use webgl
<tcsc>	the latter is probably overkill from the sound of it
<ghostchilli>	https://jsfiddle.net/3p1js9q5/  Trying to recolor line from top to green line
<tejasmanohar>	https://gist.github.com/tejasmanohar/085b373d4f8da9ea8d98#file-controller-js-L81
<tejasmanohar>	im getting this error that im not really sure how to track down
<tejasmanohar>	keeps telling me that CastError: Cast to undefined failed for value "[object Object]" at path "referrals"
<tejasmanohar>	referrals is supposed to be an array
<tejasmanohar>	ive included my model, controller, the highlighted line of error, and the error itself
<tcsc>	wow thats not at all what i thought you were talking about. yeah i'd probably use canvas2d + filled paths but there could be a better way.
<tejasmanohar>	if someone could clue me in the right direction or what to console.log or a speculation of why im getting the error, thatd really help!
<dcrk>	hey all
<dcrk>	when using promises, is it safe to manipulate the result?
<cjohnson>	ghostchilli: you could mock the effect by using a gradient that fades to transparent
<cjohnson>	dcrk: depends. if the result is an object, and you are using the promise in the format of var p = new Promise(...); p.then(funca); p.then(funcb); then you could have side effects on funcb
<cjohnson>	but if you do p.then(funca).then(funcb); then the first .then returns a new promise
<tejasmanohar>	cjohnson: are you aware what could be my issue here? it seems to be some type error as its a casterror from mongo... referrals is an array []
<Havvy>	dcrk:  It's shared mutable state. If you know you are the only consumer, yes. If not, no.
<cjohnson>	and you can just return the modified object
<tejasmanohar>	im console logging those two values that im using in the query and thats why i think its right
<dcrk>	Havvy, cjohnson: exactly what I wanted to know, thanks. I will return an new object
<tejasmanohar>	http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.update
<Havvy>	b> var p = Promise.resolve({});  p.then((o) => { o.x = true; }); p.then((o) => { console.log(o.x); })
<babelbot>	Havvy: {} true
<cjohnson>	tejasmanohar: which line is the error on?
<Havvy>	b> var p = Promise.resolve({});  p.then((o) => { o.x = "mutated"; }); p.then((o) => { console.log(o.x); })
<babelbot>	Havvy: {} mutated
<tejasmanohar>	cjohnson: 80
<tejasmanohar>	the 4 is a linemark for me :)
<tejasmanohar>	'4\n'+err so i can spot which err is printed ;)
<dcrk>	Havvy: that's awesome :D thanks
<tejasmanohar>	cjohnson: that is line 80 of the first file btw, controller.js
<cjohnson>	oh, mongoose error
<cjohnson>	no clue then
<cjohnson>	I'd ask #node.js
<cjohnson>	or #mongodb if it exists
<Sorella>	Mutating things inside promises is a really bad idea, because you don't know *when* things will get to run.
<Sorella>	dcrk: ^
<cjohnson>	they'll always run in the order their callbacks are defined Sorella so that shouldn't matter
<cjohnson>	unless you mean you're adding your callbacks asynchronously
<dcrk>	Sorella: what do you mean? I have a deterministic order of promises' execution
<Sorella>	cjohnson: function foo(bar){ return doSomething().then(function(a){ return bar.then(function(b){ doOtherThing(a, b) }) }) }. That method has absolutely no way of knowing whether `bar` was modified arbitrarily outside of `foo`.
<tejasmanohar>	cjohnson: no prob! i have asked in #node.js. #mongodb, im not sure because they don't speak node all the time there :\
<Sorella>	You avoid all of those problems by just not mutating things that are inside promises. Then order stops mattering.
<dcrk>	Sorella: isn't it fine mutating when you are absolutely sure you're the only consumer of the promise?
<Sorella>	dcrk: no, the complexity makes reasoning about your application extremely difficult.
<Sorella>	dcrk: local mutations are sometimes okay. It's unlikely that you'll have local mutations in a promise.
<Sorella>	(unless the promise never gets outside your function, in which case it could be okay-ish).
<Sorella>	You don't need mutation in any case. For 99.9% of everything
<dcrk>	Sorella: thanks, I will take that advice :)
<tcsc>	avoiding mutation often means additional allocation/gc pressure, so you might need it if you have performance requirements :/
<tcsc>	but i doubt this is the case if you're in a promise.
<Sorella>	tcsc: not quite.
<cjohnson>	Sorella: oh, nested. I was just talking about a.then.then.then
<tcsc>	Sorella: i'm all ears, this is the single biggest pain point i have with js
<Sorella>	tcsc: though in JS, yeah, you're going to be creating new objects. But it's unlikely that it's going to matter for most applications. And for some, it's actually going to give you *more* performance (e.g.: GUIs)
<dcrk>	tcsc: it actually is, and that's why I asked. It requires some html templates from other modules and compiling then to use with handlebars
<tcsc>	for this it won't. i'm in a game and i don't want to be allocating a bunch of vectors per frame.
<Wraithan>	tcsc: the stuff that hits hardenough that needs to be allocation free is the sort of stuff that you end up using buffers with typedarrays on to do stuff
<Wraithan>	which is not the world folks who would venture to use a promise live in
<dcrk>	I was mutating everything but will cut the mutation to the point where promises leave the function
<tcsc>	Wraithan: you can't really do that for stuff like collision detection or physics
<Sorella>	tcsc: sure, if you're writing something like a game, that's going to be quite different from 99.9% of the use cases people use JS for
<Wraithan>	considering how slow they are (especially native ones comared to bluebird)
<tcsc>	for rendering, yes.

<tcsc>	not that c or c++ are really good at this, but they're acceptable.
<Sorella>	You can do that in any language though
<tcsc>	for the second part, only if you're willing to ship another runtime with your languages runtime, which wasn't the case for what i worked on
<tcsc>	and for the first, only if you never need to upstream your work
<IronD>	What are best practices for sharing code on here for review?
<IronD>	should i link to it? or just post directly on here?
<tcsc>	paste it right into the channel
<tcsc>	(kidding)
<Sorella>	!paste
<ecmabot>	Sorella: Show some code, but don't paste it on the channel. You can provide a test case we can run and help you with your problem with http://jsfiddle.net , http://jsbin.com , or http://requirebin.com . Sites like http://gist.github.com/ and http://bpaste.net are cool too.
<IronD>	Good thing I asked
<Sorella>	Well, sure, if you want to contribute to an existing compiler toolchain, you'll have to use the same technology they use.
<tcsc>	fwiw, that wasn't what i did. i worked on a constraint programming language for a while in grad school, and shipping a runtime other than our own would have been unacceptable
<IronD>	ecmabot: Thanks!
<IronD>	I now have a question: Without much context, why would chrome tell me this (Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'split' of null) about this (rawArray = input.split("\r");)?
<tcsc>	input is null
<IronD>	yes but does that happen when you call the function or when you declare it?
<tcsc>	when you call it
<IronD>	so even if the input IS a string and not null?
<tcsc>	it is not a string because it is null
<IronD>	but at the end of the script it does what I expect...
<tcsc>	well, its going to be stopping after it hits that line
<tcsc>	during execution, not parsing.
<tcsc>	it might be in a callback so maybe something else is doing the thing you expect?
<iam>	i have this problem where a page is generated with javascript and doesn't work, but when i take the source code that is generated and put it in a separate html file it works fine
<iam>	any ideas on what could be causing this
<IronD>	tcsc: Ill take a second look at it
<IronD>	tcsc?
<tcsc>	hm?
<IronD>	Can you take a quick look at the whole thing?
<IronD>	http://jsfiddle.net/cy3fLu2j/
<tcsc>	hm
<tcsc>	what is it that you want to happen
<tcsc>	because there are several issues but i think you're confused about the control flow.
<IronD>	I am confused about many things
<IronD>	ok
<IronD>	so First
<IronD>	Text file gets loaded by input type file
<IronD>	"file"*
<IronD>	I then take this file and turn it into a string by using reader.result
<IronD>	split the string, clean each element up and remove any unwanted extra spaces
<IronD>	this should then be pushed into protoArray
<IronD>	by cleanFileAndArray
<tcsc>	okay, so when do you think onFileLoad is called
<tcsc>	and when do you think line 7 is executed
<tcsc>	relative to eachother, what is the order of those two things
<IronD>	Well line 7 I dont know, I was just moving it around to see if it made a difference
<IronD>	it should probably be at the end though
<IronD>	onFileLoad is called before it in that circumstance
<tcsc>	no matter where you put it, it will be executed before the onFileLoad
<IronD>	ok
<tcsc>	onFileLoad is called when the event fires
<tcsc>	which isn't until someone actually chooses a file
<tcsc>	all you're doing in line 6 is saying 'hey browser, when someone choses a file, call this function'
*	Torkable is now known as Guest22222
<IronD>	So that is not really doing anything useful?
<iam>	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16893043/jquery-click-event-not-working-after-adding-class-using-jquery found it
<tcsc>	its totally necessary, but it doesn't do any work right away
<tcsc>	it does work later
<tcsc>	or
<tcsc>	sets it up to be done later
<yansanmo>	IronD,  http://jsfiddle.net/cy3fLu2j/1/
<IronD>	So once the file is loaded it does this
<IronD>	ok let me look first i guess
<yansanmo>	error with the cleanFileAndArray
<gtwy>	anyone have a second? seems like i need to reset the event listener for .click()
<gtwy>	https://jsfiddle.net/gtwy/86015sro/
<gtwy>	click on one of those
<IronD>	yours does not give me an error...?
<IronD>	yansanmo*
<yansanmo>	oh right.. no error, but my file doesn't have any \r
<yansanmo>	so when it shift, it returns nothing
<gtwy>	if i use a click event listener, do i need to reset it afterwards? i never encounted this before
<gtwy>	and ive been using click() a lot
<tcsc>	ugh, it kills me to have to set the 2d contexts color as a string. absolutely kills me. i mean, its not going to be something i use for the final product, but its seriously like they sat down and chose the worst of all possible apis for this
<IronD>	yansanmo: Thanks! I will study your changes and hopefully learn exactly what you did differently
<yansanmo>	using onloadend event
<IronD>	tcsc: thanks for the help!
<IronD>	yep
<tcsc>	np
<IronD>	jsut saw it
<gtwy>	yansanmo: is that for me?
<IronD>	just*
<IronD>	yansanmo: Yep just saw it
<yansanmo>	for IronD
<gtwy>	i have a table. when you click on a row, it creates a new row. when you click again, it hides it.
<gtwy>	thats good
<gtwy>	but when you try to click again
<gtwy>	it is broken
<gtwy>	it needs to keep expanding and closing. i put a test https://jsfiddle.net/gtwy/86015sro/
<gtwy>	im sure its just that the event listener is no longer listening
<gtwy>	but why
<yansanmo>	your condition at line 44 is always true after the first click
<gtwy>	it would be different tho if you clicked on another row
<gtwy>	and then it wouldnt equal it anymore
<yansanmo>	nope, you don't change the "row"
<gtwy>	yansanmo: OH
<gtwy>	yansanmo: thanks
<gtwy>	ill see if that does it :)
<yansanmo>	also it should be children(".procurementSection")
<gtwy>	yes
<gtwy>	thanks
<gtwy>	caught that
<Friss>	Should also look into switching to .on() instead of .click() http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9122078/difference-between-onclick-vs-click
<gtwy>	Friss: reading this now
<gtwy>	thanks
<gtwy>	i was mostly screwed up cause i was assuming i needed to reload the event listener, which i never had to do before
<gtwy>	so thanks for getting me straight again
<gtwy>	well looks like i need to use .on
<gtwy>	im going to have hundreds of rows in the table
<gtwy>	and i dont want it to create hundreds of separate handlers
<gtwy>	Friss: is there an on hover also i should be using instead of .hover
<Friss>	you can use .on with any event just change .on('hover', ".selector", function(){})
<gtwy>	thanks again
<Friss>	np
<gtwy>	Friss: whats the opposite of hover (i.e. when i leave the element)
<gtwy>	.hover lets me call both in one
<deltab>	:not(:hover)
<deltab>	oh, in jquery?
<Friss>	mouseleave
<Friss>	mouseenter, mouseleave are the events
<deltab>	.hover can be given two callbacks
<gtwy>	on('click' not really any more difficult to implement
<gtwy>	all done
<gtwy>	glad i learned that now at the beginning

<boar>	Take a look at react if you're going to have that, at work we recently changed to it and the performance increase was massive
<javascript907>	Can anyone help me with naming? Trying to figure out how to expose an api that has two types of routing, one linear (similar to koa-js) and one hierarchical (similar to abyssa-js). I have a router that can work both ways but i's so hard to choose how the api is exposed.

*	m0noprotic is now known as mmango
<tcsc>	i don't know anything about those libraries but you might want to use the names linear and hierarchical.
<javascript907>	tcsc: Seems a bit verbose and probably off-putting for someone coming from either of these libraries.
*	mmango is now known as monoqrotic
<tcsc>	well, that's fair. i tend to err on the side of verbiosity, but to each their own.
<tcsc>	mainly because its easy to think of and i dont like spending too long stressing about what to name things
<tcsc>	finally, movement is starting to feel really solid :) http://s.codepen.io/thomcc/debug/7b89fc627fbacd9dc0bd0800e748ef57
<IronD>	cool!
*	Maxdamantus did something like that recently in 3D.
<IronD>	I was trying to shoot for the first few seconds...then realized
<Maxdamantus>	though it did things in terms of collisions.
<tcsc>	Maxdamantus: what do you mean
<tcsc>	did you find a bug?
<tcsc>	oh
<tcsc>	wait
<Maxdamantus>	eg, if you keep going left there, you'd expect it to fly off when rebounding on the triangle.
<tcsc>	missed what your first message was
<tcsc>	hm
<tcsc>	which triangle, the big pillar one?
<Maxdamantus>	Yes.
<tcsc>	hm. so you think gravity might be on too hight?
<tcsc>	or something like that?
<Maxdamantus>	I don't think it's gravity.
<tcsc>	you'd expect it to fly off in what direction?
<Maxdamantus>	I suspect it's the fact that you have states like "wallsliding"
<tcsc>	you can only wall slide on vertical walls
<tcsc>	not on the triangle
<tcsc>	although, yeah
<Maxdamantus>	I'd expect it to fly up in an almost vertical direction.
<tcsc>	ah, you mean a more elastic response
<Maxdamantus>	if the triangle were 45°, it would go vertical.
<tcsc>	that actually should happen on triangles that are 45 deg
<tcsc>	it doesnt on that one because gravity pushes you down and you still have a lot of forward momentum
<tcsc>	also because theres air control
<tcsc>	and so if you hold left there is a force pushing you that way even in the air
*	robotmayo is now known as zz_robotmayo
<Maxdamantus>	Yeah, assuming you can stop pressing left as soon as you touch it.
<Maxdamantus>	but the result of that collision should make the horizontal velocity vertical.
<portablejim>	Is there something avaliable to parse java serialized objects (even given a known class structure)?
<tcsc>	eh, possibly. the physics is a bit janky right now
<tcsc>	and by a bit, i mean super
<tcsc>	this is the result of 2 weekends worth of work
<tcsc>	so, i havent made everything super robust.
<tcsc>	what you describe is visible when you hit angles while falling
<tcsc>	and i suspect it works generally beause stuff like the curved surfaces work, but it might have some bugs
<Maxdamantus>	http://maxdamantus.eu.org/golf.htm in case you're interested (proof of concept, or something)
<tcsc>	and i usually work in 3d too, its actually really surprising how much easier 2d is. you can just, actually use sat without too many issues because there aren't that many axes.
<GreenJello>	!java @ portablejim
<ecmabot>	portablejim: Remember, Java is to JavaScript as Pain is to Painting, or Ham is to Hamster. We don't know Java, and if you're trying to apply your Java knowledge to JavaScript, it probably won't work. See also: http://ow.ly/GMctL and https://twitter.com/ryber/status/567681894662164480 - Try ##java
<Maxdamantus>	(it's three-dimensional, so it looks kind of strange until you think about it)
<portablejim>	GreenJello: I know.
<Maxdamantus>	the grey things are all complete hemispheres.
<GreenJello>	what is a "java serialized objects"?
<GreenJello>	can you pastebin an example?
<tcsc>	Maxdamantus: what effect am i looking for?
<Maxdamantus>	tcsc: if you drop the ball into the big hemisphere with a decent velocity it bounces around crazily.
<Maxdamantus>	tcsc: because it's not stuck to the side.
<Maxdamantus>	tcsc: it only appears to be stuck to the side once gravity pushes it into the hemisphere more than the velocity bounces it out.
<Maxdamantus>	(the bar on the right is the third dimension)
<andrew39>	is encapsulation a big thing within the js community?
<portablejim>	GreenJello, I am referring to an object created in java turned into a binary stream/file eg. http://www.jitendrazaa.com/blog/java/serialization-marshalling-deflating-in-java/
*	zz_robotmayo is now known as robotmayo
<portablejim>	GreenJello: I found doppio, however it does not implement ObjectInputStream or ObjectOutputStream.
<GreenJello>	ah okay, other than trying to convert it to a more portable format (like json) before it gets to JS, you're probably going to find half baked solutions
<GreenJello>	mostly because that's what everyone does, so there isn't much of a need for this
<tcsc>	Maxdamantus: yeah. all i do to resolve collisions atm is just project the object away from the collider by the amount it's inside of it
<tcsc>	this works but is probably not physically accurate
<tcsc>	i also think the player bouncing around a lot might be kind of weird and undesirable from a gameplay perspective though
<Maxdamantus>	Right. My thing does that, and it deflects the velocity around the line between the centre of the sphere and the point of collision.
<Maxdamantus>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Reflection_angles.svg
<tcsc>	i dont really do that. i project the `out` vector onto the velocity and reduce it by that much
<portablejim>	GreenJello: I am definitely seeing that. Using Java to do json is easy. However, as I am thinking on making a webapp version of a java app that uses a seralised object as a storage type, I can't really fix it java-side.
<tcsc>	i suspect that the reflection angle would be handled naturally by the way i'm doing it right now, but maybe not.
<GreenJello>	portablejim, can't you run a translation service in between?
<tcsc>	so yeah, i actually do no bouncing.
<tcsc>	now that i think about it.
<GreenJello>	just a proxy written in java that translates the responses to/from this format?
<Maxdamantus>	With bouncing, you shouldn't need states like sliding/wallsliding/falling.
<portablejim>	I could, although I did want it to be entirely in JS / clientside.
<Maxdamantus>	The ball is always falling.
<tcsc>	those exist mainly for gameplay
<tcsc>	jumping is the same as falling but we're still adding force up
<tcsc>	sliding is when the player is on the ground and input and the velocity aren't in the same direction
<tcsc>	and wall sliding slows falling allows you to do a wall jump.
<tcsc>	and it resets your double jump.
<tcsc>	again, i'm more concened with gameplay and the controls, uh, feeling right than i am with physical correctness
<Maxdamantus>	What's the difference between a walljump and a normal jump?
<tcsc>	different projection vectors
<Maxdamantus>	wallsliding also seems to cause odd friction.
<tcsc>	thats intentional
<tcsc>	you're hanging onto the wall
<tcsc>	and sliding down it
<Maxdamantus>	Ah.
<tcsc>	if i had the animations in this would be slightly clearer
<forQuery>	is there a clean way to tell what functions are called whan  button is clicked?  i tried the profiles tab and recording, but when i click a button it gives me like 30 things, none of which seem quite relevant.
<Maxdamantus>	fwiw, I think reasonably correct physics makes controls for things feel more right.

*	Maxdamantus mostly plays Elasto Mania, which has a reasonable degree of physical accuracy.
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	Doing stuff is very hard.
<tcsc>	Maxdamantus: did you play super meat boy?
<Maxdamantus>	eg, if you're falling, and you accelerate the wheel, the bike rotates as well as the wheel.
*	Torkable is now known as Guest57872
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	Today I've spent literal hours straight just thinking about one idea after another for "the next Minecraft", but they all require resources and skills that I simply don't posess.
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	*possess
<Maxdamantus>	(because when you rotate a wheel in mid-air, who's to say the wheel isn't rotating you?)
<tcsc>	mmmmmmmmmmmm: what skills
<Maxdamantus>	actually, it happens to also be like it's in a vacuum, so mid-air isn't accurate.
<tcsc>	although, next minecraft is *probably* not going to be the idea
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	One thing that keeps coming back is drawing sprites, tiles and animating it.
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	Another is the advanced AI or network code required.
<Maxdamantus>	Don't think I have.
<tcsc>	well, the frist part is very easy
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	"next minecraft is *probably* not going to be the idea" <- ?
<tcsc>	ai isn't terribly hard but netcode sucks the most
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	"Ai isn't terribly hard" <-- ???
<tcsc>	it really isnt
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	"Just" generating random worlds alone, with no living beings in it, is a nightmare.
<tcsc>	for games at least
<tcsc>	well, it depends on what you're looking to do.
<tcsc>	if you are thinking person-level AI okay thats very hard. usually the technique for doing game AI is to make it very good at the game (not hard, since computers can know what the best move is always) and then dumb it down to the desired difficulty
<tcsc>	most level generation algorithms that have shipped in games (that i know of, at least) aren't very complex either. minecraft is probably the only notable exception, and it didn't start complex.
<Maxdamantus>	It's often hard to know what the best move is.
<tcsc>	it depends on the game
<Maxdamantus>	eg, try writing an AI for Elasto Mania
*	welly[work][away is now known as welly[work]
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	Action Supercross was the name of the original, no?
<Maxdamantus>	a lot of platform games also have impossible AIs.
<Maxdamantus>	Action Supercross was the predecessor, made by the same guy.
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	Hmm...
*	robotmayo is now known as zz_robotmayo
<tcsc>	it depends on the restrictions on the ai. you usually end up making it too good though, in my experience.
<Maxdamantus>	http://www.recsource.tv/r/fpyveziuoj
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	That Minecraft guy didn't even have any screenshots or videos or even any real info about the game. He just had his site and basically said: "Give me money. Then you can download my game."
<tcsc>	i remember there was a weekend where paypal had broken for him so there was a free weekend demo
<tcsc>	that was when i got minecraft
<tcsc>	i still think that the 'next minecraft' is going to be very very different than minecraft. if you try to do the same thing you're doomed to be one of the millions of minecraft imitations
<preaction>	don't try to be the next anything...
<tcsc>	^
<preaction>	minecraft wasn't even the first minecraft
<preaction>	facebook wasn't the first facebook. google wasn't the first google
<TheCowboy>	angry birds wasn't the first angry birds
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	By "next Minecraft", I don't mean "game that is likely Minecraft".
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	I mean in terms of success.
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	But frankly, it doesn't need to be anywhere close to that.
<tcsc>	you did describe needing extremely complex world generation
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	As long as it brings in a living wage.
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	Not really "extremely complex". Anything but dead-simple such is very hard to code...
<tcsc>	no it really isnt
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	s/likely/like/
<preaction>	emergent behavior is a funny thing
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	Emergent behaviour?
<preaction>	the whole is greater than the sum of its parts
<tcsc>	mmmmmmmmmmmm: try coding one before you say that it's very hard. maybe do some research into the techniques if you're stumped? it's much easier than a lot of other areas of game dev.
<j201_>	LCGs still blow my mind
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	LCG?
<tcsc>	as in the rng?
<j201_>	yeah
<Maxdamantus>	low-cost games?
<preaction>	living card games?
<j201_>	linear congruential generators
<Maxdamantus>	Oh.
*	preaction was just being facetious
<preaction>	literal carbon gametes?
<tcsc>	i dunno. they make sense to me
<preaction>	mmmmmmmmmmmm: remake acrophobia as a mobile party game
<j201_>	you're just becoming the new npm site :P
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	I absolutely refuse to make anything for "mobile devices".
<tcsc>	mmmmmmmmmmmm: if you want to make a living in game dev right now, release on steam. much better market than mobile
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	I'd rather starve to death in the gutter.
<tcsc>	oh
<tcsc>	well, good then.
<preaction>	good, you've already got the right attitude to fail as a self-employed person
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	Also, my PayPal account was banned years ago, so I can only charge with Bitcoin.
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	Yes, it doesn't look bright.
<j201_>	tcsc: i was just giving them as a super-simple example of emergence: how you get chaotic behaviour with a few simple operations
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	Still, the number of desktop users world-wide is not exactly low.
<tcsc>	j201_: oh hm
<tcsc>	yeah thats a pretty neat example
<tcsc>	the steam market is so much better than the mobile market right now its a joke
<preaction>	unless you're a mod author
<tcsc>	hah
<j201_>	although much of the mobile market is just making old things new again
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	What *is* steam anyway? It's some sort of program for Windows and Mac OS X and Linux and inside of it, you can pay money to Valve, Inc.?
<j201_>	flappy bird is just the millionth port of helicopter
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	And then you get to play games in some sort of controlled DRM manner?
<preaction>	steam is a distribution platform for software
<tcsc>	basically.
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	That doesn't tell me anything.
<tcsc>	the drm is very light and customer friendly though
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	Translation from business language, thanks.
<tcsc>	its a program that you buy games on
<tcsc>	and sometimes not games
<tcsc>	like i think you can buy art softwae on it too but nobody does
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	And it forces you to use a certain language/API?
<tcsc>	no
<preaction>	no
<j201_>	but you the programs are 'hosted' by steam so you're dependent on it
<tcsc>	well, you generally want to talk to the steam api
<j201_>	steam/origin is to programs as itunes is to music
<preaction>	not... really
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	So I cannot make anything controversial or else they won't greenlight it?
<tcsc>	which they distribute as a dll
<tcsc>	uh, you can
<tcsc>	definitely
<tcsc>	i've never heard of them rejecting stuff due to content
<preaction>	there's the eroge with the ero parts cut out, for example
<preaction>	a quick patch puts them back
<tcsc>	short of porn they always let stuff through. hotline miami 2 and binding of isaac, which were both prevented in various other channels, are on steam for example
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	Do they take a % of all sales and no other fees? I can't find a single bit of useful info on their site.
<tcsc>	they take a cut, yeah
<tcsc>	30% i think
<tcsc>	maybe 20
<tcsc>	yeah 30
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	So... why would I *not* want to use Steam as a developer, if the game is finished and they only take a cut of sales?
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	There is usually some dark catch.
<benaiah>	mmmmmmmmmmmm: mostly ideological reasons. hence why most people use steam
<tcsc>	30% cut is big
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	In the case of Nintendo's eShop, you had to pay for an expensive hardware devkit even for HTML 5 games.
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	s/had/have/
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	They only tell you about that requirement when you are deep into the application progress, though.
<tcsc>	dunno, never shipped on nintendo, but i've shipped on steam and it was fairly plesant
<tcsc>	only complaints are with upload times really
<tcsc>	it takes forever to upload patches
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	So let's say I make my game in JavaScript and NW.js... I'd just hand them the finished bundles for each OS and they package it up in some Steam format?
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	It takes forever to upload patches? Very unexpected complaint.
<tcsc>	well when it's 5 o'clock and it takes two hours...
<tcsc>	and you want to go home to eat dinner
<tcsc>	and basically. we did some bindings to the steam api, but theyr'e optional and were mostly so that we could use their networking.
<preaction>	how does that work? i kept seeing references to it, but it all looked rather sketchy.
<preaction>	i mean, why?
<tcsc>	why what?
<preaction>	why use their networking api
<tcsc>	you don't have to
<preaction>	is that the lobby stuff?
<tcsc>	yeah basically
<preaction>	right, i'm saying why would you want to? does it get you something nice?
<tcsc>	i didn't write the netcode so i'm only like 60% sure on this though
<preaction>	besides free lobbies, of course
<preaction>	i think there's some URL-based launching thing that enables too, but again, details were sketchy
<preaction>	i was going to release some AIR apps on steam, but after 5 years that company basically dissolved
*	knod is now known as knod_away
<tcsc>	again, i'm not the guy who wrote the netcode or the steam api bindings. i do know they're entirely optional, as our older games are still on steam and have networking, but don't use the steam api
<preaction>	no worries, thanks anyway. last time i checked, a long time ago, you had to talk to their sales department to even get at the API docs. now, i think that's changed a bit
<tcsc>	yeah, that almost certainly happened for us
<tcsc>	i think it has though, since greenlight is very open
<preaction>	and back then they were somehow making flash games work with the steam apis, but there was absolutely no indication of that on their site
<tcsc>	hm, i don't know. the only game i shipped on steam was in c++
<preaction>	1000 Amps is the game i noticed is pure flash and somehow the steam overlay works, but that overlay i think is something wildly different from the actual steam APIs
<tcsc>	yeah, not sure if it is.
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	I fear even when the game is done, it's put on Steam and nobody notices it in the sea of other games.
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	Many probably even free of charge.
<tcsc>	mmmmmmmmmmmm: when you release you get 5 times you can put your game on the front page
<preaction>	welcome to the democratization of game/app dev. the ones who make the money are the ones who control the market
<tcsc>	fwiw
<tcsc>	and you can buy more
<tcsc>	and get more if your game becomes popular
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	5 times? That's generous... how long do they stay there?
<tcsc>	like a day maybe
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	So five full days in theory on the front page?
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	Assuming they have any number of users, that sounds like your game would be seen by quite a few.
<tcsc>	in theory. not 100% sure how long it lasts. ours tends to be about a day, and i don't think it's due to overwhelming popularity (since its kind of a niche game)
<tcsc>	and yeah
<tcsc>	you get seen by a good amount
<tcsc>	and it shows up on the page of people who like similar games
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	tcsc: Any numbers?
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	Even links?
<tcsc>	numbers/links for what
<msafi>	Is there a way in lodash or underscore to make arrayA an exact copy of arrayB by running a series of mutations rather than simply copying arrayB into arrayA?
<msafi>	Is there even a name for what I'm trying to do? I don't even know how to google it
<tcsc>	here are some stats: http://steamspy.com/. i'd rather not give out sales information about the game i work on out on a public irc channel, and i don't know 100% of them anyway, but if you're really interested you can pm me
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	I just noticed "Wyrmsun" on Steam by browsing their site. It looks like an extremely close rip-off of Warcraft II.
<mmmmmmmmmmmm>	You can just rip off commercial games like that?
<tcsc>	uh, game ideas concepts arent copywritable, only assets and exact plots
<tcsc>	ideas/concepts
<tcsc>	well, exact is probably relative.
<tcsc>	but regarding plots, if it wouldn't be okay for a movie its not okay for a game

<beaky>	hello
<foofin>	Hello!
<beaky>	what is the meaning of this and new in javascript
<ljharb>	!this @ beaky
<ecmabot>	beaky: If a function call is of the form `a.b()`, `this` will be the object you accessed the "b" property from. Otherwise, if it's of the form `a()`, `this` will be `undefined`, which is turned into the global object if the function isn't in strict mode. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/08/30/understanding-javascripts-this/
<beaky>	ah
<beaky>	!new @ beaky
<ecmabot>	beaky: When you call a function with `new`, the `this` binding is set to a new object that has as its prototype ThatFunction.prototype, and if the function does not return an object, the result is that object. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new
<beaky>	is .prototype a special property in js
<beaky>	btw is that story about js being designed and implemented in 2 days a real story
<j201>	beaky: not outside of how `new` uses it
<beaky>	so new is like the prototypal inheritance operator in js?
<j201>	it's one way of doing it
<j201>	Object.create is another
<j201>	and there are various functions in libraries that implement other approaches (you can easily implement `new` as a function, for example)
<beaky>	ah
<j201>	beaky: also, 10 days is the generally accepted timeframe, see: https://brendaneich.com/2011/06/new-javascript-engine-module-owner/
<tcsc>	i cant even imagine that much crunch
<beaky>	yeah i personally would need 10 years just to implement the DOM in javascript
<tcsc>	does that count the dom?
<j201>	not sure
<beaky>	yeah wasnt js designed to hack the dom
<j201>	although it is a browser scripting language, so it would need some kind of API for it
<tcsc>	and what amount of done is this, are we talking 'tech demo' level or shippable
<beaky>	"we need to ship this browser in 10 days can u do it"
<beaky>	probably like that :D
<tcsc>	in 10 days of 'do a language right now' i might be able to get something buggy out, if i crunched really hard
<tcsc>	but shit
<j201>	looks like 'prototype' is how people describe it
<j201>	i would just say 'ehh, use scheme or lua'
<tcsc>	probably not 10 days
<tcsc>	probably like 2-3 weeks
<j201>	which is what i think eich did, but the mozilla overlords wanted something javaey
<tcsc>	did lua exist then?
<j201>	(which is why we have `new` and `this` and so on)
<beaky>	why does js have prototypes
<j201>	yes, although it was only two years old
<tcsc>	because brenden eich liked self
<beaky>	(which probably no other programming language out there have anything resembling prototypes)
<beaky>	oh
<tcsc>	self and lua both have prototypes
<beaky>	oh right
<tcsc>	lua didnt when it came out though iirc
<j201>	beaky: but one consequence of all this is that `new` came out kinda kludgy
<j201>	since eich used prototypes, but it had to look like java
<j201>	Object.create is a more basic way to deal with prototypes, and many JSers have embraced it as a better approach
<ljharb>	of course, the best is to not use inheritance at all.
<j201>	although ES6 and HTML5 make heavy use of `new` (grumble,grumble...)
<beaky>	hmm i thought object literals > Object.create() ?
<j201>	beaky: they do different things
<beaky>	oh
<j201>	and yeah, in general, i agree with ljharb here
<tcsc>	when is there a benefit for using object.create over new
<beaky>	idk frameeowkrs like angular and ember  rely on inheritance very heavily
<beaky>	to do their magic
<beaky>	even more basic ones like backbone
<j201>	tcsc: it doesn't force you into the 'constructor' approach, so it's more flexible in that sense, and can be often used as a cheap 'copy' operation. they are equivalent in a sense, though, since each can be implemented in terms of each otehr
<ljharb>	beaky: that doesn't mean it's good. it just means that's the best pattern their authors are familiar with.
<beaky>	ah
<beaky>	yeah i dont understand why frameworks do that  vs. plain constructors returning plain objects... (no wonder i dont design frameworks myself :()
<Nate_Bradley>	has anyone made an escort website??
<j201>	aaand that's my cue to go to bed
<j201>	'night all
<Nate_Bradley>	why?
<preaction>	nah, i don't much care for them. i prefer the civic
<Nate_Bradley>	no i mean female companions "escorts" that come to you and exchange time and companionship for money
<preaction>	isn't that sexist? there are male escorts
<ljharb>	is this a javascript question?
<Nate_Bradley>	yeah, i was wondering how to do it
<Nate_Bradley>	what should i use?
<preaction>	a basic website tutorial
<mindstorm8191>	evening everyone.  Does anyone know if javascript will have any trouble with heavy image scaling?  I'm planning to make a spaceship game where I need to zoom all the way into individual ship parts, then out to view an entire battlefield
<tcsc>	you probably want to be doing it on the gpu
<tcsc>	so
<preaction>	javascript won't have a problem, but computers might. there's a reason why all the map applications have different images at different scaling
<beaky>	yeah image scaling stuff is probably beyond js's scope
<mindstorm8191>	preaction: ok... yeah that would make sense
<deltab>	sometimes called LoD (level of detail)
<tcsc>	you'll also want to be doing mipmapping on the textures
<tcsc>	but overall you definitely don't want be doing this at runtime in js.
<deltab>	switch between images depending on zoom level
<mindstorm8191>	deltab: I've heard of that... have multiple images for different zoom levels
<mindstorm8191>	tcsc: what exactly is mipmapping?
<tcsc>	its where you have progressively lower resolution versions of the texture attached to the texture
<tcsc>	its supported natively in hardware
<tcsc>	it helps with scaling artifacts and improves perf for scaling images
<tcsc>	i dont think you'd want to swap out textures here for zooming in/out in a game
<tcsc>	you'd probably want to just do trilinear filtering (bilinear and blend between mip levels) on the textures
<tcsc>	either way you need to be using webgl to do this, but if you're doing that its straightforward.
<mindstorm8191>	...perhaps I can switch everything to radar-type blip graphics at higher ranges though... that could work
<tcsc>	uh, up to you.
<mindstorm8191>	hmm... I tried webgl a few weeks ago... I was able to get it to run, but... it ran horribly slow
<tcsc>	then you were probably doing it wrong.
<tcsc>	>_>
<mindstorm8191>	naa.  I probably have a computer that is too old to handle it properly
<deltab>	or you don't have the right drives installed/working
<deltab>	drivers
<mindstorm8191>	I also tried Unity, and its demo game ran very slowly
<tcsc>	^ is more likely
<tcsc>	err, what deltab said
<tcsc>	either way you sort of need a decenly okay computer to develop games that run well... failing that, just try making something simple?
<tcsc>	which is how you need to start anyway
<mindstorm8191>	tcsc: yeah I might be pushed into keeping the game (graphically) simple
<beaky>	are there any sneaky differences between function declarations and assigning functions to variables? i.e. function foo(){} vs var foo = function foo(){}
<deltab>	!hoisting
<ecmabot>	deltab: http://johnkpaul.com/blog/2013/02/11/what-is-hoisting-really/ https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Scope_Cheatsheet
<deltab>	declarations are hoisted, meaning the names are usable from the top of the block
<deltab>	>> f(); function f() { console.log('like this'); }
<ecmabot>	deltab: undefined; Console: 'like this'
<deltab>	>> f(); var f = function f() { console.log('like this'); }
<ecmabot>	deltab: TypeError: f is not a function
<beaky>	is hoisting bad
<deltab>	no
<deltab>	bad?
<beaky>	i like how hoisting lets u define functions that appear in code earlier
<beaky>	but maybe it can be confusing
<ljharb>	it can
<ljharb>	imo hoisting should be avoided, for that reason.
<boar>	ljharb: It's generally better to define your variables and functions at the top of the code yeah?
<ljharb>	that's what i do
<mindstorm8191>	blah... I honestly don't enjoy working on the graphics for games...
<ljharb>	ie, i don't use anything until after it's been defined, and i define things as close as possible to where JS will hoist them (the top of the function)
<boar>	mindstorm8191: 2D sprites can be fairly fun to make, but throw a baton at anything that is 3D
<mindstorm8191>	boar: well I'm currently trying to make a zoomed-in version of a 2D ship part I have
<Maxdamantus>	ljharb: so no recursive or mutually recursive functions?
<ljharb>	Maxdamantus: recursion is calling a function after its name is defined, lexically
<Maxdamantus>	ljharb: unless you do something like: function fac(fac, n){ return n > 0? n*fac(n - 1) : 1; }
<boar>	mindstorm8191: Hope your using a program that doesn't apply AA to it when you zoom in
<ljharb>	Maxdamantus: example of "mutually recursive"?
<Maxdamantus>	fac(fac, 4)
<ljharb>	why would you have that
<Maxdamantus>	ljharb: mutually recursive: function foo(){ return bar(); } function bar(){ return foo(); }
<Maxdamantus>	ljharb: to avoid hoisting.
<mindstorm8191>	boar: well, its MS paint, so... anything double-sized only turns each pixel into a 2x2 block
<Maxdamantus>	ljharb: it's not calling it after it's defined lexically.
<ljharb>	Maxdamantus: function fac(n) { return n <= 1 ? 1 : fac(n - 1); } isn't hoisting
<Maxdamantus>	>> var x = x + 1; x; @ ljharb
<ecmabot>	ljharb: (number) NaN
<boar>	Maxdamantus: Isn't that just destroying readability?
<ljharb>	conceptually it's not, anyways
<Maxdamantus>	ljharb: it's just as much hoisting as anything else.
<ljharb>	but at any rate, no, i never use recursion anyways.
<ljharb>	recursion is not just rarely the best way to express an algorithm in my experience, but also, dangerous in JS, until TCO.
<ljharb>	but sure, for recursion, you may need to rely on *some* hoisting.
<ljharb>	there's also a bit of a difference between your "var x" example and your "function fac" example, conceptually.
<boar>	Recursion is generally fairly slow too, check out recursive A* vs normal A*
<Maxdamantus>	ljharb: var f = function(){ return f(); }; f();
<ljharb>	even if under the hood, it's still the same
<Maxdamantus>	ljharb: my `function fac` example was one that didn't rely on hoisting.
<Maxdamantus>	(lexically)
<ljharb>	the fac(fac, n) one i can't see how it works
*	xaxxon_ is now known as xaxxon
<ljharb>	the first arg will shadow the function name
<Maxdamantus>	ljharb: that's intentional.
<Maxdamantus>	ljharb: you have to pass fac the fac function, because the fac function doesn't exist before the fac function is created.
<ljharb>	so you'd have to do `fac(fac, 2)` or whatever?
<Maxdamantus>	Yes.
<ljharb>	lol, i don't hate hoisting *that* much.
<tejasmanohar>	i want to trigger the html5 validation kinda ui to show up but not for an html5 validation
<tejasmanohar>	so validation telephon # for example
<tejasmanohar>	ill test the input's value with a regex nd then if it doesnt .test() true then i will want to display that form popover thing that chrome shows when theres an html5 validation error with custom text
<tejasmanohar>	is that possible?
<ljharb>	why would you just not use the builtin validation
<ljharb>	pattern="regex"
<tejasmanohar>	oh oops, forgot about pattern
<tejasmanohar>	thank you
<Nate_Bradley>	do you think this is racist?
<Nate_Bradley>	http://www.telegraphacademy.com/
<tejasmanohar>	is html5 pattern's regex the same as js regex? ljharb
<ljharb>	similar, yes
<ljharb>	!g dive into html5 pattern @ tejasmanohar
<ecmabot>	tejasmanohar: Canvas - Dive Into HTML5 <http://diveintohtml5.info/canvas.html>
<ljharb>	Nate_Bradley: if you have to ask, yes
<ljharb>	Nate_Bradley: altho no, not at all
<ljharb>	Nate_Bradley: why would you think that's racist
<Nate_Bradley>	ljharb, now think for a moment... what if that said for whites?
<ljharb>	actually, nvm, if you're not trolling, feel free to PM me, but otherwise it's a huge troll discussion and we shouldn't have it in the JS channel.
<tejasmanohar>	^
<beaky>	btw are es6 arrows nothing more than sugar for anonymous functions? why give them the special name arrows in that case
<tejasmanohar>	to beat at coffeescript
<tejasmanohar>	jk idk
<beaky>	hehe
<tejasmanohar>	*beat out
<ljharb>	beaky: they're different.
<ljharb>	fat arrow functions have a lexical this/arguments/super, and can't be constructed.
<beaky>	ah
<kevrom>	fat arrow functions also have an implicit return when used without braces
<beaky>	i guess it helps take the confusion out of what `this` is when its used as closures
<ljharb>	fat arrows are basically intended solely to replace callbacks
<tejasmanohar>	ljharb: how can i make the - optional or switchoutable for another character? \d{3}[\-]\d{3}[\-]\d{4}
<tejasmanohar>	*and
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: ? makes chars optional
<ljharb>	what "other character"
<tejasmanohar>	anything like a "." for example?
<tejasmanohar>	so yeah if i made the "-" optional so people dont have to type 123-456-7890 but instead 1234567890 would be fine
<tejasmanohar>	but nothing like 123-4567890 since thats not right
<tejasmanohar>	all delimeters or no delimieters and the delimeter either - or . is what i was going for. maybe just change [\-] to [\-,.] ?
<ljharb>	that's trickier
<ljharb>	what's wrong with 123-4567890
<ljharb>	just check that it's got the right number of digits.
<ljharb>	([^\d]*\d[^\d]*){9} or something
<tejasmanohar>	oh yeahi guess youre right on that
<tejasmanohar>	ill strip all the -/./" " on backend anyways
<ljharb>	right
<ljharb>	also what about international numbers
<tejasmanohar>	not now
<ljharb>	just like emails, regex-based validation *is never correct*
<tejasmanohar>	yeah
<ljharb>	the only way to know that either one works is to *call, text, or email it*
<tejasmanohar>	my backend code will just only send to us #s
<ljharb>	and make them click a link or enter a code.
<tejasmanohar>	yeah
<substack>	phonenumber = phonenumber.replace(/\D+/g, '')
<ljharb>	ok so don't validate at all, just let them enter it, and try to text it.
<tejasmanohar>	maxmind can do that
<ljharb>	you should trust that they'll enter the right phone number.
<ljharb>	and if not, they'll enter it again and you can text that.
<ljharb>	substack: lol thanks, i spaced on \D
<tejasmanohar>	meh i guess, i would prefer not to text them to confirm to signup on a waiting list... i could just delete them from the db if phone text fails on the nexzt notif
<substack>	but anyways why would you ever need a phone number from someone
<substack>	that's stupid
<substack>	phones are legacy garbage technology
<substack>	also not everyone has them
<substack>	I always make up a phone number everytime an internet form wants one
<tejasmanohar>	it's a smartphone app
<substack>	fuck your data
<ljharb>	do more people have phones, or email addresses?
<tejasmanohar>	i mean i kinda trust that if the user actually wants to be texted when they can use the app, theyll put the real # lol
<substack>	not everyone has a phone number. not everyone has an email address. not everyone has a street address.
*	simius1 is now known as simius
<substack>	not everyone has a credit card
<substack>	etc
<ljharb>	all true
<ljharb>	altho for most apps, if the user doesn't have X, they're not a valuable user of the app anyways
<substack>	not everyone has a government issued ID either
<tejasmanohar>	its a smartphone app lol
<ljharb>	but at any rate, actually contacting the email/phone, charging the CC, snail mailing the street address, etc, is the only way to be sure.
<tejasmanohar>	yes
<ljharb>	so your system should be set up to do that.
<substack>	just give people a text box
<tejasmanohar>	ill jsut delete them if the text fails
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: better to set them to "failed" or something, but ok
<tejasmanohar>	ljharb: yeah i can do that. if it fails repeated times i can prob delete
<tejasmanohar>	they cant change it anyways
<tejasmanohar>	its a subscription, its not an account
<ljharb>	sure it's an account
<ljharb>	altho i don't know what they're subscribing to
<tejasmanohar>	meh i guess it's an account
<tejasmanohar>	to be notified when they can use our app
<tejasmanohar>	like a betalist
<substack>	tejasmanohar: why does it need to be a phone number?
<substack>	phones suck
<tejasmanohar>	substack: http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/
<tejasmanohar>	substack: meh, get an SMS when the app is ready
<tejasmanohar>	seems logical
<tejasmanohar>	you'll probably find that article amusing substack  :P
<beaky>	i love these falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-x articles but i wish they went into more detail on the best approach to those kind of things beyond 'dont assume too much/too little'
<tejasmanohar>	:)
<beaky>	also i think software having to assume anything about names is ultimately a byproduct of legal systems and stuff where these things are specific requirements
<beaky>	i love laws
<tejasmanohar>	ljharb: do u know why my pattern isnt working? http://6e9a9fb3.ngrok.io im using the base \d{3}[\-]\d{3}[\-]\d{4} thats used here
<tejasmanohar>	and it works there
<ljharb>	make a jsfiddle where it doesn't work
<tejasmanohar>	will do
<tejasmanohar>	ljharb: http://jsfiddle.net/8c9ctfsf/
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: you're not escaping your dashes in the [ ]. but the real problem is that it's "\d" not "d"
<tejasmanohar>	\d{3}[\-]\d{3}[\-]\d{4}
<tejasmanohar>	no luck http://jsfiddle.net/8c9ctfsf/3/ ljharb
<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: you have to escape all three d's
<Nate_Bradley>	so do you think there'd be a chimpout if there was a programming bootcamp only for white people?

<ljharb>	tejasmanohar: if you want it required, you need to add "required"
<tejasmanohar>	oh yeah

<tuskkk___>	I have a string (link) /notebook/listFolders/folderName/test26 , I have a newName I want to add at the place of test26, how do I do it?
<ljharb>	!mdn string replace @ tuskkk___
<ecmabot>	tuskkk___: String.prototype.replace() - JavaScript | MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace>
<tuskkk___>	I was thinking str.replace, but it requires the old name
<ljharb>	well sure
<tuskkk___>	ah yes, but I don't have a way to fetch the oldName ljharb
<ljharb>	if you don't have the old name how do you replace it
<tuskkk___>	ljharb: need to extract it from that link, after the last /

<tuskkk___>	ljharb: yes

<prohobo>	i dont even know why people still buy them
<Nate_Bradley>	they don't have the last same consonant

<prohobo>	yeah it does, in the rapper sense of rhymes

<prohobo>	eminem would agree that it's a rhyme

<PHPLearner>	hi fellas
<PHPLearner>	just want to ask
<PHPLearner>	if I have 4 spas
<PHPLearner>	this is involving an application in Mathematics
<PHPLearner>	basic operations
<PHPLearner>	each one is for each operation
<PHPLearner>	if I have two functions that is being called by each spa can I place these two functions in another js file and just call them from each of those four different pages
<GreenJello>	PHPLearner, yes
<tejasmanohar>	i have \d{3}[ .-]\d{3}[ .-]\d{4} and it accepts everything i want except without the delimeter
<GreenJello>	usually you use something like browserify to manage modules of code, and you have one entry point (main file) for each bundle you want to create
<tejasmanohar>	it accepts 123-456-7890, 123.456.7890, 123 456 7890, etc. but not 1234567890
<tejasmanohar>	not sure how to make that [ .-] optional
<GreenJello>	put a ? after it
<tejasmanohar>	(?:\d{3}[ .-]?){2}\d{4}
<GreenJello>	? means 0 to 1
<tejasmanohar>	now that is some nice regex
<tejasmanohar>	(?:\d{3}[ .-]?){2}\d{4}
<PHPLearner>	GreenJello: Thanks
<GreenJello>	PHPLearner, most important thing to remember is that if tools can figure things out for you, that's better than us silly humans trying to do it right :-)
<PHPLearner>	GreenJello: ok let me explain my project a bit further
<PHPLearner>	I am creating app for a school
<PHPLearner>	Math exercises for primary level students
<prohobo>	poke em in the eyes
<PHPLearner>	this involves the four basic math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
<PHPLearner>	now I have one page for each of those
<PHPLearner>	but the message each time a child makes an error or makes an correct answer happens to be the same for all of those four pages
<PHPLearner>	GreenJello: so what I had in mind is to refactor this two functions correctMessage() and wrongMessage() into another JS file because in case this project grows big at least I have done some cleaning up of the code
<PHPLearner>	GreenJello: so I was contemplating of maybe creating my own library unique to this project
<PHPLearner>	now my question again is this new library that I might come up with can also be loaded and use by the other four apps I just have to load the main.js file just like any js file right?
<prohobo>	?

<watts0>	vileRaisin: I have an iframe because I have sublime-scroll script
<vileRaisin>	have you tried to see if window.SublimeScroll.iframe exists
<vileRaisin>	and if you can bind it to that
<watts0>	vileRaisin: window.SublimeScroll.iframe returns undefined, if i try to bind mousemove, it returns Object {} and nothing happens
<Guest42>	hello everyone
<beaky>	hello Guest42
<Guest42>	I have a question
<oddalot>	ok
<Guest42>	so my company has a site where you can login to check your schedule etc
<oddalot>	alright
<Guest42>	it doesnt use a typical form to login, but a table and javascript
<oddalot>	ok
<Guest42>	in the javascript there are loads of wierd urls, such as http://shoptoearn.hhonors.com/ and other similar sites
<Guest42>	is this normal?
<Guest42>	which have nothing to do with my company
<oddalot>	depends on where in the page the javascript is i guess
<ljharb>	that's up to the site. they can have whatever they want on it.
<Guest42>	i thought it might be something to obfusace or whatever its called the code?
<oddalot>	it might be some ads or something
<Guest42>	the urls are found on my companys site, and have really nothing to do with them
<Guest42>	and there are no ads or anything, its a really basic site
<beaky>	yeah it could be doing auth to consume apis from those domains
<beaky>	oh
<ljharb>	it could be ads.
<beaky>	maybe its copy-paste stuff
<ljharb>	or tracking code.
<ljharb>	who knows
<beaky>	only the original authors know ask them :D
<Guest42>	ah true
<Guest42>	might have to do that hehe
<Guest42>	just thought it looked wierd, beeing a swedish company and all hehe
<Guest42>	anyways, thanks for the answers everyone
<oddalot>	np
<Guest42>	might as well continue with my questions since im here hehe
<oddalot>	we aim to please
<Guest42>	so im trying to login to this site using python, but found that they are not using regular forms for auth as I said before
<Guest42>	havent seen this been done before
<Guest42>	so Im guessing it has to be done with javascript?
<oddalot>	well, login can be done a ton of different ways
<oddalot>	you could do it entirely on the front end using javascript, if there is a third party involved
<oddalot>	of course, that just means the backend is someone elses
<Guest42>	k
<oddalot>	or somewhere else, like facebook for example
<oddalot>	but whatever backend that company is using probably uses one language, like python etc..
<Guest42>	but is has to post the information somewhere right?
<FatNoLife>	hi guys
<oddalot>	javascript could be used to send an ajax request to the backend, or it could be using a regular http request without javascript
<Guest42>	okok
<Guest42>	feel this might be a lot more messy than I had thoguht
<oddalot>	you can see in the browsers the requests your broswers makes
<oddalot>	in the developer panel
<Guest42>	awesome :)
<oddalot>	so just open that up, try and log in, and see what is happening
<oddalot>	probably want to use chrome
<Guest42>	yea Im on chrome
<Guest42>	im guessing its the network tab?
<oddalot>	yeah, i think so
<oddalot>	sometimes you have to refresh the page once you open the network tab
<FatNoLife>	oh man, mondays are always such a pain in the ass...
<oddalot>	but you should see all the requests, even for the html/css and images etc...
<moep>	Morning
<oddalot>	yeah, for realz
<FatNoLife>	hi moep
<Guest42>	oddalot thanks alot! found the post url and was able to login using my pythonthingy
<Guest42>	for ever grateful :)
<oddalot>	np
<Guest42>	damn this site is awfully coded =/
<beaky>	Guest42: from my impression of stories from sites like http://thedailywtf.com/ most sites in the `real world` are horrible
*	michd is now known as MichD
<beaky>	i wonder why theres an overabundance of bad design stories in programming while theres no thedailywtf equivalent for other fields
<FatNoLife>	75% of sites are horribly coded and work badly... welcome to the life of a programmer
<Guest42>	I wonder why that is
<Guest42>	I mean, there is obviously a lot of talent everywhere
<FatNoLife>	because most people don't want to pay someone who knows what they're doing because they want to save money by paying someone who doesn't know what they're doign
<FatNoLife>	people think "the internet makes money, i gotta get me some of that!" and then "what? 2000$ for a well-made site while some monkeys in pakistan only cost 500$???"
<FatNoLife>	the monkeys in pakistan thing wasnt a racist comment.... i didn't think that phrase very well through...
<ljharb>	yeah, it came off that way.
<DragonPunch>	yeah...jerk.
<FatNoLife>	:/
<watts0>	:/
<DragonPunch>	I'm talking to a developer from Argentina. They aren't very costly.
<Guest42>	but the point got through ;)
<FatNoLife>	well... besides the monkey part... that's basicly how it goes down 70% of the time
<FatNoLife>	then people get a website that's doesn't even respect MVC
<DragonPunch>	I need to code, sorry, I can't partake in this discussion.
<ljharb>	MVC isn't always the best pattern anyways.
<DJ-NotYet>	ljharb +1
<beaky>	yeah mvc is just a (really broad and vague) architectural paradigm not a silverbullet to perfect design
<FatNoLife>	true... you could use something like BPMN and have a process based framework... but you get my point
<Flonk>	ams: still, thats a really bad comparison
<vileRaisin>	took a while
<vileRaisin>	watts0:
<vileRaisin>	but I found it
<vileRaisin>	sublimescroll uses custom events
<vileRaisin>	mousemove.sublimeScroll
<watts0>	I tried to comment that
<vileRaisin>	well it works for me
<watts0>	what did u do? just comment it?
<vileRaisin>	$(window).on( 'mousemove.sublimeScroll' )
<vileRaisin>	$(window).on( 'mousemove.sublimeScroll', function(){} )
<watts0>	moment
<watts0>	vileRaisin: now this is binded one the whole window, not on iframe only
<vileRaisin>	yeah you can also bind it to the iframe body
<vileRaisin>	or just the contentDocument
<vileRaisin>	I'm not sure why normal events don't work though, it's not an origin problem
<jerrt>	I just noticed that chrome seems to send out multiple requests for an svg data-url I've used as the background on an element
<jerrt>	whenever I animate it
<jerrt>	weird
<jerrt>	like, each frame seems to request the thing over
<watts0>	vileRaisin: can this be the problem function bind$(obj, key, target)
<vileRaisin>	no because I didn't use bind
<vileRaisin>	and that's an internal function
<vileRaisin>	it's not exposed to the global
<Sharaal>	hi, if I want to load a js file dynamically I can write a script tag per document.write, so the browser will load the given file. But how it would be solved to execute some js after the loading of this file, second script tag per document.write?
<vileRaisin>	I honestly don't know why it doesn't work if you use your own events, curious
<watts0>	it's strane to me too...
<watts0>	strange*
<vileRaisin>	Sharaai, it's better if you use createElement( 'script' ); and then set the src property, after that you should be able to check for onreadystatechange property, or onload
<watts0>	I can see the bind loaded, but it doesn't trigger on event...
<ljharb>	^
<Sharaal>	vileRaisin: sounds well, do you have an example?
<ljharb>	you can just add 2 script tags. they'll be executed in order.
<ljharb>	no document.write.
<vileRaisin>	or what ljharb says
<GreenJello>	ljharb, they're executed in order when added dynamically?
<ljharb>	yes, always
<ljharb>	i'm pretty certain
<ljharb>	worth trying tho, just in case.
<FatNoLife>	oh my glob... reading 2 articles from thedailywtf made me cry for the career of being a developer...
<GreenJello>	ljharb, http://jsfiddle.net/oqfxtqq8/
<GreenJello>	they execute when ready
<GreenJello>	order isn't enforced, which is why AMD exists :-)
<ljharb>	wow, sad
<ljharb>	ok, my bad then
<ljharb>	cjs ftw
<vileRaisin>	anyhow Sharaal
<vileRaisin>	sfiddle.net/g4a4hpfe/1/
<Sharaal>	vileRaisin: ljharb: will try it, thx :)
<watts0>	do you know any other way to get iframe document position ?
<vileRaisin>	watts0: generally with iframe it's best to use postMessage inside it, and have an message eventlistener on the root document to get that message
<vileRaisin>	you can probably do * as origin if it's your own iframe
<watts0>	it is own
<NBhosting>	this shoudl work for removing a element right?
<NBhosting>	document.getElementById("checkerid"+checkerid).remove()
<watts0>	var element = document.getElementById("element-id");  element.parentNode.removeChild(element);
<NBhosting>	thanks
*	meandi_2 is now known as meandi
<NBhosting>	think i missing the point here, when i remove all elements with $('.checker').remove();  and i rebuild them after that line, they wont appear
<jerrt>	what do you mean "rebuild"?
<NBhosting>	my script is creating the element .checker like 30 of them
<NBhosting>	and i delete em on change so he rebuild again correctly
<NBhosting>	think im overlooking something
<NBhosting>	ill show yah
<jerrt>	maybe put the relevant bits in a jsfiddle?
<NBhosting>	its a bit much , 1 sec
<NBhosting>	http://93.158.222.150/backgammon/25/
<NBhosting>	try to move a element
<NBhosting>	it then deletes all the checkers, and should rebuild
<NBhosting>	somehow it doesnt
<NBhosting>	maybe this is not the best way of doing it
<NBhosting>	a stone move is recorded in the db,  the rebuild builds from db data
<jerrt>	looks like you're in for a series of console.log checks
<jerrt>	took a cursory look, couldn't spot anything weird
<NBhosting>	yeah seems to, must be missing something :D
<jerrt>	first step would probably be to log something right before the panelslide.appendChild(spike); call
<NBhosting>	k to check if that happends
<FatNoLife>	console.log... what would i ever do without you?
<NBhosting>	it seems to be hitting the creation code
<jerrt>	try logging panelslide and spike
<NBhosting>	does run
<NBhosting>	ah it doesnt get to the checker creation, let me look why
<kephra>	is it possible for two PHPs in two frames/tab to talk to each other, or even to access the DOM of a 2nd frame/tab that is created by JS?
<kephra>	s/PHPs/JavaScripts/ *sorry*
<NBhosting>	mm found it, http://93.158.222.150/backgammon/25/  not very prety do, move a white stone
<NBhosting>	i gues deleting them all makes it ugly
<NBhosting>	i should only delete the moved stone
<NBhosting>	and rebuild
*	subhayan_ice9 is now known as ice[9]
<jerrt>	why not just move the stone instead of removing it at all?
<hipsterslapfight>	NBhosting: this sounds like a very good use-case for react
<NBhosting>	react?
<hipsterslapfight>	https://github.com/facebook/react
<NBhosting>	yeah i think i should just delete the one stone
<NBhosting>	and rebuild ony that stone
<NBhosting>	or just move the stone and log it in db, no rebuild
<NBhosting>	onyl rebuild on refresh
<NBhosting>	this would work without the db part in it, but i gues the db call gives it that 0.005 sec delay
<NBhosting>	that would be much worse with lots of players
*	startupality_ is now known as startupality
<NBhosting>	now i got to figur out how i get the id of the stone im moving
<NBhosting>	$(ui.draggable) i think
<footer>	Hi
<beaky>	hello footer
<NBhosting>	yep
<footer>	Can anyone please tell me whats wrong with delete method in bst  Ideone.com/h8nu9O
<footer>	Maxdamantus :p
<okdamn>	can i do something like DELETE from array WHERE array[item] LIKE %'hey' ?
<NBhosting>	you can search in arrays for sure
<okdamn>	need to iterate over the array with a loop or i can skip looping?
<NBhosting>	i think there are search functions
<okdamn>	mmmm maybe map()?
<NBhosting>	https://www.google.nl/search?q=javascript+search+in+array&oq=javascript+search+in+array&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.7998j0j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8
<NBhosting>	indexOF it seems
<NBhosting>	or inArray
<NBhosting>	theres also a contains
<beaky>	array = array.filter(function(item) {return item.match(/^.*hey$/); })
<beaky>	something like that
<okdamn>	if you so gentle please post it here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30165329/javascript-delete-array-items-by-value-like
<okdamn>	beaky:  cool solution i just wait and see if any better solution ;)
<okdamn>	thanks a lot
<mcspud>	okdamn there isnt a better solution
<okdamn>	mcspud:  i would like to be sure about it :P
<okdamn>	cause i am going to use this method on a HUGE array very huge
<mcspud>	okdamn: javascript is essentially a fully featured functional language now (bar some abstract stuff like monads).  Seriously, that is the best way
*	Clause_ is now known as Clause
<mcspud>	It takes an array, applies a method to it that recursively calls an anonymous function
<paldepind>	okdamn, array = array.filter(function(item) {return item.indexOf('hey') !== -1; })
<beaky>	the fastest possible method would be to get your dbms to filter it for u before you get it from AJAX if possible
<paldepind>	mcspud, you can use an implement monads in JS.
<NBhosting>	when im updating a element to/left do i need todo something before it snaps back into position, something like update
<beaky>	(esp since the dataset is large)
<NBhosting>	top/left
<okdamn>	paldepind:  yeah that looks the actual most voted solution ;)
<okdamn>	thanks
<okdamn>	beaky:  sure before it's clear ;)
<paldepind>	okdamn, IMO it's more idiomatic than using a regex
<mcspud>	paldepind: can you like me to an example?
<NBhosting>	i gues i could just delete and create it again on the old position
<okdamn>	paldepind:  yep an example is much appreciated man
<paldepind>	mcspud, https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land
<beaky>	js arrays are monads
<paldepind>	mcspud, that's a specification for monads in JS.
<paldepind>	I've created a functional reactive programming library in JS: https://github.com/paldepind/flyd
<paldepind>	What do you think?
<mcspud>	paldepind: great thanks.  Is that in EMCA7?
<paldepind>	mcspud, No. It's just a community specification.
<beaky>	what is functional reactive programming
<paldepind>	beaky, there is a link to a great tutorial in the readme of Flyd.
<mcspud>	beaky, read the intro: "Functional reactive programming is a powerful programming paradigm for expressing values that change over time."
<mcspud>	paldepind: I will have a play with this over the next few weeks, cheers
<mcspud>	looks good
<paldepind>	mcspud, Thank you. If you have any questions or find something that's missing don't hesitate to open an issue on GitHub :)
<mcspud>	:)
<_rgn>	paldepind: can you describe what your intuition is for when you FRP is a good fit for some use case, if that makes sense
<paldepind>	_rgn, When you have a lot of state in your program that varies due to time and user input. I think it's useful in all programs with user interactions.
<paldepind>	_rgn, Basically GUIs is a great fit for FRP. And JS programmers creates a lot of GUIs.
<mcspud>	paldepind: I can think of a use case for this immediately that I need for tomorrow.  I'll let you know how it goes(went).  Cheers
*	alexcf2 is now known as alexcf
<paldepind>	mcspud, I'm happy to hear that :) Definitely let me know.
<mcspud>	paldepind: this is so useful - var sum = flyd.endsOn([n1.end, n2.end, killer], flyd.stream([n1, n2], function() {
<mcspud>	  return n1() + n2();
<mcspud>	wd
<beaky>	is frp better than mvc
<paldepind>	mcspud, I think so too :)
<paldepind>	beaky, they're not really comparable. MVC is an architecture. But I think better architectures can be built with FRP.
<mcspud>	paldepind: Yes, being able to specify if streams of different length will lead to a termination is just groovy, especially if they are registered as subdependencies.  (I assume the <end> event emits up through the entire thing?)
<paldepind>	mcspud, when a stream ends all it's dependencies will ends as well yes.
<beaky>	isnt frp just turning values into lazy sequences
<paldepind>	beaky, that depends on what you mean with "sequence". A stream can for instance consist of click events. You can't do that with a sequence if it's an array.
<beaky>	wow that lib is awesome i can just treat my event sources updates separately as streams,  event sinks as plain values and compose them and stuff (like aggregating form  results into a unit object)
*	argoneus is now known as Kingsquee
*	Kingsquee is now known as argoneus
*	Guest42 is now known as klonkr
<beaky>	hmm how do u make sure u dont end up with stale data in frp
<hipsterslapfight>	you mean an event returning out of order?
<beaky>	ye
<hipsterslapfight>	easy, many libraries provide methods for that
<hipsterslapfight>	you have something like flatmaplatest in rxjs
<hipsterslapfight>	i am sure paldepind has something similar in flyd?
<beaky>	ye https://github.com/paldepind/flyd-switchlatest
<beaky>	btw why do all the frp libs use different names for the same things
<hipsterslapfight>	there's no agreed-upon naming unfortunately
<hipsterslapfight>	not even for frp, you get many things saying they are frp when other things would say they are not :/
<beaky>	so what is and isnt frp
<beaky>	what distances frp from just programming with streams
<Eppiox>	the amount of time spent in arguments probably xD
<beaky>	lol
<Perseus0>	hey, what's the best place to acquire domains?
<beaky>	i think frp really helps cut down callback event listener hell and stuff
<beaky>	and simpler than 2 way binding
<paldepind>	hipsterslapfight, Rx uses a bunch of different names for flatMapLatest.
<paldepind>	hipsterslapfight, but it's a silly name because it map first and then flattens. So at least it should be `flatLatestMap`.
<beaky>	why not call it join
<hipsterslapfight>	haha paldepind it is yes
<beaky>	btw why dont big frameworks like angular or ember use frp
<paldepind>	hipsterslapfight, there was a long discussion an we decided on `switchLatest` because Rx uses `switch` but `switchLatest` was more descriptive and didn't collide with a JS reserved word.
<hipsterslapfight>	paldepind: fair enough, makes sense to me
<hipsterslapfight>	i wasn't complaining about your naming choice btw :v
<paldepind>	beaky, Why do you think join would be a good name? There is `merge` if you just want to combine streams.
<mikehaas763>	In chrome dev tools, I'm looking at the computed styles for an element. There is a width set on it (27.53125px) but there is no arrow for that node to drop down and see where the style is coming from. Could this be because the style is being set from JS land?
<beaky>	isnt join the haskell name for the operation
<paldepind>	beaky, I think the big difference between FRP and just programming with streams is that FRP is based heavily on higher order functions over streams.
<beaky>	or is it bind.... shit naming things is hard lol
<beaky>	ah
<paldepind>	hipsterslapfight, I know :) I was just explaining.
<hipsterslapfight>	beaky: it is, we all know there's only two hard problems in programming
<hipsterslapfight>	naming things, and rampant misogyny
<paldepind>	Haha
<beaky>	btw what is rx
<hipsterslapfight>	microsofts frp library
<beaky>	how do i use frp in angularjs
<beaky>	ah
<paldepind>	beaky, RxJS: https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS
<paldepind>	It's a big fat monster ;)
<hipsterslapfight>	it sure is
<beaky>	wow rx is awesome
<beaky>	maybe i can replace angularjs controllers with frp streams
<paldepind>	I think using FRP with Angular will be tricky.
<beaky>	but angularjs scoping rules :( so best i can do is delegate
<hipsterslapfight>	angular and f®p do not mix well
<beaky>	why not :(
<hipsterslapfight>	... thanks 
<hipsterslapfight>	f( r )p
<beaky>	frp(tm)
<hipsterslapfight>	frp™
<beaky>	the problem i have in angular is how to do component-component communication in a nice way and maybe frp helps with that
<hipsterslapfight>	fortunately not trademarked though, despite all the varying implementations
<paldepind>	beaky, You could indeed do that.
<mcspud>	paldepind: do you know of anyone using this with ReactJS?
<hipsterslapfight>	frp, or the library in particular?
<mcspud>	frp in general
<hipsterslapfight>	there's quite a few i'm sure, though most of the ones i'm personally acquainted with are in clojure
<hipsterslapfight>	https://github.com/Day8/re-frame is my current favourite clojurescript-over-react-thing
<mcspud>	"You believe that, by early 2015, ReactJS had won the JavaScript framework wars and you are curious about the bigger implications." - I'm that guy ;)
<mikehaas763>	In chrome dev tools, I'm looking at the computed styles for an element. There is a width set on it (27.53125px) but there is no arrow for that node to drop down and see where the style is coming from. Could this be because the style is being set from JS land?
<beaky>	why use clojruescript instead of js
<paldepind>	mcspud, No. But that is certainly possible.
<hipsterslapfight>	beaky: it's a functional language, and all that that entails
<beaky>	wont there be interop problems with using existing js libs in clojreuscirp
<hipsterslapfight>	in some cases, there's wrappers for many though
<me110>	anyone prefer webstorm over a text editor?
<me110>	toying with the idea of a purchase
<hipsterslapfight>	over a plain text editor? sure. over a proper environment? not personally
<me110>	yeah. i’m up in the air about sublime. i like it a lot but just scared about it’s closed nature. i just want to invest in something that’s going to be around. i tried atom but it’s too slow for my taste
<mikehaas763>	me110: I prefer it. It's just a preference. My opinion is that WebStorm is as "proper" to dev environment for frontend code as yo u can get
<beaky>	vim
<beaky>	or emacs
<mikehaas763>	me110: You could try visual studio code that just came out. It's very new but it's much snappier then brackets and atom
<me110>	mikehaas763: vscode does look interesting
<me110>	mikehaas763: how about performance? i know it’s heavy as an ide. i have an 8gb mac
<mikehaas763>	me110: performance for webstorm?
<me110>	yeah
<hipsterslapfight>	beaky: spacemacs
<hipsterslapfight>	the best of both vim and emacs!
<beaky>	use ed. ed is the lightest text editor ever made
<mikehaas763>	Well, I have a very fast machine so I'm can't say for sure. I know it's going to use more resources than just a text editor because it's a full blown Java application. The performance impact for me is usually just during app start up and when the IDE initially indexes a large project. There is a free trial you  can download and just see how it perf
<mikehaas763>	orms
<me110>	cool mikehaas763, i’ll have to give it a test run
<beaky>	ed is the ultimate editor
<beaky>	ed is the expressjs of text editors (visual studio would be like java ee)
<mikehaas763>	beaky not visual studio code
<mikehaas763>	I mean, maybe relatively compared to ed.
<ankr>	you get the flexibility of notepad and the speed of eclipse
*	SneakerXZ_ is now known as SneakerXZ
<mikehaas763>	seems backwards
<ankr>	(troll smiley)
<ankr>	Just wanted to contribute to the always useful discussion regarding vi vs emacs ;)
<hipsterslapfight>	i was serious in my recommendation for spacemacs https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs it's actually very good
<hipsterslapfight>	it's evil-mode done right for emacs
<Sharaal1>	*throw webstorm into the room*
*	Sharaal1 is now known as Sharaal
*	lance|afk is now known as lanceball
<paldepind>	hipsterslapfight, why would I use it instead of vim?
<hipsterslapfight>	paldepind: emacs extensibility and various features that make it more of an OS than a text editor :v
<paldepind>	hipsterslapfight, that's not very spefific. Most of the things that sucks about vim is being fixed in neovim.
<hipsterslapfight>	some stuff exists for vim, but i have hundreds of emacs packages here and many do not
<hipsterslapfight>	also, things like cider which don't have any good vim equivalents
<hipsterslapfight>	(fireplace is good, but not nearly good enough)
<hipsterslapfight>	also yes neovim shows promise but still seems to be some way off, unless things have changed recently?
<michaelis>	I have programmed a little in an OOP language and there class and inheritance is pretty straightforward. On the other hand, learning javascript just makes me confused with it's prototypal inheritance. I still haven't grasped it fully. Anyone else having this problem?
<paldepind>	hipsterslapfight, it is. But for me it promises an easy switch to get more features. emacs + vim emulation looks like more work.
<beaky>	idki find js prototype inheritance to be the most intuitive thing in the world
<hipsterslapfight>	paldepind: ahh, but with spacemacs the work is already done
<hipsterslapfight>	they fixed the packaging, add proper updating, install everything for you, and group things into layers to easily turn them on or off or add/remove
<beaky>	prototype inheritance is like saying 'my object is like that object, but with some extra stuff'
<michaelis>	beaky, So is class inheritance.
<michaelis>	To me javascript is object only.
<michaelis>	No bad in that but it gets very confusing when not explained properly.
<beaky>	yes instead of saying 'my class is like that class', the realtionship is at the object level
<beaky>	thats it :D
<paldepind>	hipsterslapfight, so what if I install some-fancy-emacs-plugin. Will it work with the vim keybindings?
<michaelis>	beaky, I'm not going to argue with you but for one coming from classical OOP javascript is confusing.
<hipsterslapfight>	paldepind: almost everything you would want exists already, if not they make it very easy to hook up with their `layer`s
<hipsterslapfight>	you can extend their functionality as far as you want
<javascript312>	Hi
<javascript312>	https://jsfiddle.net/780k6hpe/
<javascript312>	little code
<javascript312>	and little pb:)
<javascript312>	TypeError: this.array_super_types_trees is undefined
<me110>	michaelis: it’s weird and different, coming from classical oop. have you read mozilla’s docs? they do a nice job, i think
<me110>	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain
<paldepind>	hipsterslapfight, and it works like vim out of the box?
<hipsterslapfight>	paldepind: as far as my – rather shallow – experiences with vim show, yep
<paldepind>	hipsterslapfight, can I do macros (that's the first thing I try in vim emulators)?
<paldepind>	hipsterslapfight, I'm not very convinced. What do I win by switching besides a bette environment for Lisp languages?
<hipsterslapfight>	paldepind: yes, also i wasn't trying to convince you in particular but you can always give it a look yourself and see what you think
<paldepind>	hipsterslapfight, I would be more inclined if I knew about some benefits ;)
<paldepind>	It's not that I'm particulairly hooked on vim. I'm very hooked on modal editors though.
<martinklepsch>	hey. I'm looking for something similar to .getBoundingClientRect but for the rect where the actual content is places — i.e. with paddings taken into account
<martinklepsch>	I want to get the number that is calculated as padding by `vertical-align: middle`
<bradleymeck>	martinklepsch: .offsetWidth/Height ? you will have a rought time calculating the top/left corner though
<bradleymeck>	rough*
<zikr>	hi
<javascript312>	 Hi https://jsfiddle.net/780k6hpe/ little code and little pb:)
<zikr>	can you tell me best tutorial for javascript
<bradleymeck>	javascript312: what error are you looking for? right now you don't check that .array_super_types_trees exists prior to accessing it's .length
<vileRaisin>	javascript312: you should declare that array in the constructor, saves you the trouble
<fels_zah>	hi - any here got any experience with graph databases ?
<zlude>	Hello! I'm learning 'web notifications' and it's very nice! But I want to 'when click in' notification, browser focus the tab from notification was delivered. Web WhatsApp do that. I tried somthings that doesn't work.
<IronD>	so I notice that FileEntry(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileEntry) and FileSystem(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileSystem) are not going to be used much if at all.
<IronD>	So if I needed to, how can I write files?
<Impaloo>	How do I dynamically create unicode characters ('\u' + hexCode)?
<Impaloo>	I get syntax error if I try to do it that way
<bradleymeck>	String.fromCharCode / String.fromCodePoint
<bradleymeck>	you have to pollyfill fromCodePoint for IE/Safari
<Impaloo>	I'm on node luckily
<Impaloo>	thanks
*	grawlix is now known as grawlyx
<Impaloo>	huh, node doesn't implement String.fromCodePoint
<phutchins>	Anyone used openpgp nodejs library? or the client library? I'm having trouble loading and using it on the client side... It seemed to work for encrypt and decrypt messges but it won't generate keys. Errors because asyncProxy is null
<bradleymeck>	Impaloo: iojs should, but it is on a recent v8, node has held off on updating v8 for a while
<bradleymeck>	lets double check
*	DeviaVir_ is now known as DeviaVir
<bradleymeck>	yea its in iojs latest
<andygmb>	what's the 'safest' way to get a span's value and turn it into a decimal? parseFloat($("span").text()).toFixed(2) ?
<andygmb>	s/value/text
<cjohnson>	that looks fine, and you know toFixed returns a string right?
<cjohnson>	parseFloat gave you a float and then you turned it back into a string woth toFixed
<andygmb>	oh shucks it does? that would explain the batman NaNaNaning
<cjohnson>	;)
<cjohnson>	common mistake
<cjohnson>	think of it this way: numbers do not have any formatting, they are for calculation and formatting is for display
<cjohnson>	display = string, calculation = number
<andygmb>	very true - good way to think about it
<andygmb>	js types are string, float, array, object?
<cjohnson>	bool, null, undefined
<cjohnson>	Symbol in ES6
<andygmb>	Symbol? Gotta google what that is :p
<paldepind>	andygmb, double. Not float.
<andygmb>	ah
<cjohnson>	it's still just Number though I believe
<cjohnson>	or at least that's the prototype it inherits from
<paldepind>	cjohnson, there are both Number objects and number primitives. In both cases the numeric value is a double.
<paldepind>	cjohnson, there are subtle differences between number primitives and number objects. Slightly messy :(
<paldepind>	One can assign properties to a number object but not to a number primitive.
<mikehaas763>	I always thought JavaScript didn't have any primitives
*	x1 is now known as x3
<cjohnson>	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive
<hipsterslapfight>	best to skip issues with double/float and just call it ieee754 :v
<cjohnson>	mikehaas763: it does, but they're treated as objects that inherit from their prototypes
<cjohnson>	>> 5.3.toFixed(2)
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: (string) '5.30'
<paldepind>	cjohnson, their converted to objects when you invoke a method on them. But they're not objects with prototypes.
<cjohnson>	correct
<paldepind>	>> 1 instanceof Number
<ecmabot>	paldepind: (boolean) false
<paldepind>	>> (new Number(1)) instanceof Number
<ecmabot>	paldepind: (boolean) true
<mikehaas763>	>> 1+1
<ecmabot>	mikehaas763: (number) 2
<cjohnson>	>> 'poop'
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: (string) 'poop'
<cjohnson>	hehehe
<mikehaas763>	Lol. I just wanted to make sure I still remembered the syntax for the evaluator
<beaky>	>>[]-[]
<ecmabot>	beaky: (number) 0
<beaky>	wtf
<bradleymeck>	what about it
<bradleymeck>	>> +[]
<ecmabot>	bradleymeck: (number) 0
<yoshokatana>	beaky https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat
<cjohnson>	>> +['a']
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: (number) NaN
<beaky>	why is the most common js complaint about this kind of thing
<cjohnson>	the question is, why does it become 0
<beaky>	vs. real problems like lack of modules
<cjohnson>	I didn't see any complaining
<cjohnson>	however I agree, it is telling when that's all you can come up with to complain about
<bradleymeck>	beaky: not sure lack of modues is as big a language deal as people make it
<t94j0>	So... react-native vs titanium studio for native IOS development?
<cjohnson>	we have modules beaky
<bradleymeck>	most other programming languages don't live in all sorts of embedded environments
<beaky>	js has modules?
<cjohnson>	well, for one, we have had modules in user-land for a long time now
<bradleymeck>	beaky: es6 does, but only at much aggravation
<cjohnson>	not everything has to be in the language itself to be considered part of the ecosystem
<bradleymeck>	basically 1/2 of es6 was to get people to stop complaining rather than adding to the language I am convinced
<cjohnson>	that's one of the great things about JS is the strong user space tooling we build up around it
<beaky>	indeed
<Tennis>	hey im trying to use jquery to set the contents of a div with some html ive got stored as a string
<bradleymeck>	and if someone says mixins should be ported to classes, i will find you
<Tennis>	it keeps reloading the page though its weird
<beaky>	but for something fundamental to a language like modules its probably better to have one standard vs the 6 different js module libs
<beaky>	i think
<cjohnson>	well that's why we have es6 modules
<cjohnson>	to standardize on the work we've done in userspace
<yoshokatana>	^
<bradleymeck>	but even es6 modules have 2 modes XD
<cjohnson>	same with es6 classes
<beaky>	2 modes? o.O
<cjohnson>	it standardizes on the work we've done in userspace re: "classes" aka sugar for prototypes
<bradleymeck>	beaky: sync setup mode (the import syntax), async dynamic mode (the System.loader syntax)
<cjohnson>	it's nice to be able to know the name of the "constructor" function, even if it's not a constructor like you're used to
<bradleymeck>	classes are nice for data, but use them for adding behaviors and sadness results
<cjohnson>	uh, what
<cjohnson>	objects are nice for data
<cjohnson>	classes are for adding behaviors to that
<bradleymeck>	cjohnson: some things fundamentally don't work w/ class style programming, EventTarget/EventEmitter
<bradleymeck>	or Readable/Writable (if both are classes another object cannot be both a Readable and a Writable)
<mikehaas763>	bradleymeck: Is that really "two" modes? As far as I understand it it's not like you can flip a switch and have two different modes to modules
<cjohnson>	we don't have class style programming, we have prototypal inheritance with sugar for making it easier to figure out which method is the constructor
<bradleymeck>	classes != interfaces
<cjohnson>	and not every thing is meant to work with that sugar
<cjohnson>	that's why it's sugar
<bradleymeck>	mikehaas763: the load timing differs from what I have read
<bradleymeck>	cjohnson: I'm going to start using the term class style programming to describe what people are horrifyingly doing with es6 classes
<cjohnson>	there's nothing horrifying about it. some people have always and will continue to think that JS has java-style classes, and abuse them as such
<cjohnson>	some people understand that it's a prototype system, but it's still nicer for interopability ot standardize on a name for "init/constructor/etc"
<bradleymeck>	but I have had to fight off more and more people now that there is a `class` keyword
<cjohnson>	that isn't a prob with the class keyword but people misunderstanding JS's OOP system, which we have always had issues with for ages
<beaky>	i love classes because classes are oop and oop is the industry standard way to making software
<mikehaas763>	bradleymeck: The "sync set up" mode will all be handled behind the scenes by whatever loader is implemented in a given environment. Yes, the imports have to be read in a sync manner but the modules are still loaded async
<bradleymeck>	but now they have less of a jump to make and won't spend what little time they were learning about prototypes
<cjohnson>	so educate them
<cjohnson>	or leave them to their own devices
<cjohnson>	nothing is new here
<mikehaas763>	... System.loader is the "interface" to the underlying implementation. That spec is still being worked on though.
<cjohnson>	beaky classes are only one form of OOP
<bradleymeck>	cjohnson: i educate them, but the smaller jump means I have a quicker assault from new code, takes more of my time teaching
<bradleymeck>	its not l ike classes changed nothing, they changed perception
<mikehaas763>	There's nothing wrong with classes in ES6. It will only allow us to more easily reason about our massive codebases and structures. What I'm really scared of though is people who don't understand proper classic OOP programming abusing `extends`
<cjohnson>	bradleymeck: the perception was generally wrong to begin with. even before es6 classes
<cjohnson>	It gets brought up like once a day in here. with or without es6 classes
<bradleymeck>	it has been coming up more frequently or during code review now rather than prior to implementation, I'm not saying it was never a problem, just more of one now
<cjohnson>	Well, I disagree
<Sorella>	> There's nothing wrong with classes in ES6
<Sorella>	Well, maybe except for the part where they're not classes :P

<\malex\>	ljharb: but do you ever care about negative zeros in javascript?
<ljharb>	\malex\: the spec has to. i've never had to outside of polyfills tho.
<ljharb>	\malex\: it matters specifically if you're doing math with infinities

<xecycle>	happyface: define(["a", "b", "c", "d", ..."z"], function(a, b, /* did you notice you left out a c here? */ d, ...z) {})
<javascript399>	..hello?
<yansanmo>	is there anybody in here?
<happyface>	xecycle: I know it's terrible haha. Is having to compile stuff annoying though?
<happyface>	for debugging, remembering to update etc
<xecycle>	happyface: compiling is okay to me.  Write in prepublish of package.json, and `npm i` does everything; for continuous rebuild, write a `npm run dev`.
<happyface>	hmm yeah might be alright then. The fact of saving an indent alone is making me want to switch
<happyface>	I need to convince a bunch of people it's good though :p
<Agamemnus>	I feel fat.
<Agamemnus>	Probably because I just ate 4 of these http://vkusnogotovim.com/images/stories/recipes/medovyi_prinik_tulskiy/praniki_tulskie.jpg
<j201>	happyface: browserify gives you easy access to npm, one of the largest repositories of libraries in the world
<j201>	happyface: also, watchify makes the compiling process really easy to deal with
<j201>	i set everything up with npm scripts, watchify, and npm-watch so i just need to do `npm run watch` and all of my js and css gets compiled when i change a relevant file
<RyanBentley>	How do I, based on what is selected in this form, make the /create be /create/<value of form selection> - https://bpaste.net/show/6462b54477db
<cjohnson>	bind to the submit handler using addEventListener
<cjohnson>	and handle the form submission via javascript
<cjohnson>	you can post or get via ajax. if you don't want to do that, you can bind to the change event for the select and change the form's action

<electriv>	If anyone is in Australia and interested in a little React Native side project let me know
<cjohnson>	yeah I've investigated es6 modules and it's just not worth it quite yet
<happyface>	cjohnson: thanks for the tip
<happyface>	I thought the same
<cjohnson>	I think commonjs is where I arrived as well, hopefully presumably easy migration path to es6 modules

*	robotmayo is now known as zz_robotmayo
<Agamemnus>	very interesting technology
<bros>	https://github.com/brandonros/wannabe-mint/blob/master/index.html what practices could I better follow?
<Maxdamantus>	bros: what's the significance of 365?
<Maxdamantus>	bros: days in a year?
<Maxdamantus>	There are 365.2425 days in a year in the current calendar.
<zpartw>	My game will consist of a huge 2D grid of tiles, in several layers. So basically, a 3D box grid. How should I store this data? Each tile will of course need a number that identifies what type it is, but also some other misc data that might differ between each tile.
<zpartw>	And again, it can contain anywhere on a 5000x5000 tile grid, and also in some different Z dimensions (but not that many).
<bros>	Maxdamantus: and 30.41666666666667 days in a month?
<Maxdamantus>	>> 365.2425/12; @ bros
<ecmabot>	bros: (number) 30.436875
<Maxdamantus>	bros: no.
<Maxdamantus>	zpartw: probably a quadtree.
<deltab>	zpartw: when will different layers be accessed?
<deltab>	do you only see one at a time?
<zpartw>	deltab: Constantly. One layer might be "under ground", one layer is "ground", another is "right above ground", etc.
<zpartw>	So a stone tile might lie on top of a grass ground tile.
<Maxdamantus>	So you can think of each non-empty tile as a list of items.
<Maxdamantus>	Each such list would be in the quadtree.
<zpartw>	=
<zpartw>	*?
<bros>	Maxdamantus: anything else?
<Maxdamantus>	each non-empty 2D tile
<zpartw>	I don't get what a quad tree is.
<zpartw>	But I'm pretty sure JS has no such thing.
<deltab>	do you know binary trees?
<zpartw>	No.
<Maxdamantus>	they're not really like binary trees.
<zpartw>	I just know about arrays and objects.
<Maxdamantus>	they're a special case of binary space partitioning trees.
<Maxdamantus>	(2D BSP trees aren't quite binary trees)
<Maxdamantus>	er, 1D*
<deltab>	sure, but establishing the level of understanding
<Maxdamantus>	zpartw: imagine how you might implement a sparse array.
<zpartw>	An array of tile objects { x, y, type, specialData }, maybe. But that sounds very slow.
<zpartw>	*An array of tile objects { x, y, z, type, specialData }, maybe. But that sounds very slow.
<Maxdamantus>	zpartw: if you want to support up to 500 elements, you can create an array like: [undefined, undefined, undefined, ..], with 500 elements.
<zpartw>	I don't follow at all.
<Maxdamantus>	zpartw: or you could make a single 50-array with optional 10-arrays.
<zpartw>	Why is what I said bad? Is it too slow?
<Maxdamantus>	[[undefined, 4, 5, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined], undefined, undefined, ..], with 50 elements
<zpartw>	I really have no idea what you mean.
<zpartw>	Do you see my messages?
<Maxdamantus>	zpartw: yes.
<deltab>	zpartw: it would be, which is why you improve things by splitting it up
<Maxdamantus>	zpartw: to access element 0 in my array, you do: arr[0][0]
<Maxdamantus>	zpartw: to access element n in my array, you do: arr[Math.floor(n/10)][n%10]
<deltab>	instead of one array of 500 elements, you have one of 50 arrays, each of 10 elements
<Maxdamantus>	Indeed, as I said.
<deltab>	as Maxdamantus is explaining
<Maxdamantus>	binary space partitioning is like that, but it specifically divides into 2, instead of 50.
<zpartw>	Is that how Minecraft is doing it?
<Maxdamantus>	so to represent 500 locations, you'd have 9 layers of arrays (2⁹ = 512)
<Maxdamantus>	arr[0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0], arr[0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][1], arr[0][0][0][0][0][0][0][1][0], arr[0][0][0][0][0][0][0][1][1]
<Maxdamantus>	The advantage is that you only have a small number of 2-arrays that you use.
<zpartw>	2-arrays?!
<Havvy>	So, uh, I don't see any advantage there. Just log(n) layers of indirection compared to a flat array.
<Maxdamantus>	a quadtree has the same advantage, but it's 2D, so you end up with 4-arrays.
<deltab>	how is that not like a binary tree, by the way?
<Maxdamantus>	Havvy: in the case I made, I can represent a 500-element array with a single element using 9 2-arrays.
<Maxdamantus>	Havvy: it gets more beneficial as you increase the number of dimensions, since you're dealing with log4(n) in 3D instead of log2(n)
<Maxdamantus>	and log8(n) in 4D
<Maxdamantus>	afk
*	morlenxus is now known as Guest4053
*	morle is now known as morlenxus
<Maxdamantus>	15:57:32 < zpartw> Is that how Minecraft is doing it?
<Maxdamantus>	Although he's left, I suspect Minecraft uses a quadtree.
<Maxdamantus>	well, an octtree
*	Maxdamantus had his logs off, should've been log2(n) in 1D, log4(n) in 2D, log8(n) in 3D, log16(n) in 4D
<WhitePride_>	guys i am having trouble understanding for loops
<Maxdamantus>	The loops should be understanding for you.
*	Torkable is now known as Guest71030
<sakitram>	hi, is there any browser plugin or tool that makes a website's javascript editable while on the page ?
<boar>	WhitePride_: For loops is just a piece of code repeating the same thing over and over again
<boar>	instead of typing doSomething(); doSomething(); doSomething();
<WhitePride_>	well i don't get why or how <= is identical to <
<boar>	you can type for( var i = 0; i < 3; i++) { doSomething(); }
<xecycle>	sakitram: "editable"?  What do you expect the browser to react after your edit?
<boar>	WhitePride_: <= is a combination of === and <
<WhitePride_>	that's confusing
<boar>	It's less than or equals to
<boar>	So, 1 < 2 is true, but 2 < 2 is false
<WhitePride_>	thanks boar
<WhitePride_>	so i < 10 will loop 9 times?
<sakitram>	For example, in a webpage there is a command button when we click on it, it shows "Hello Buddy".  Now I want to change that behaviour to show "Hey Buddy"  (without doing any change in server side or main webpage/script, just only for local machine)
<Maxdamantus>	== and <, rather
<Maxdamantus>	I think.
<Maxdamantus>	>> "4" <= 4
<ecmabot>	Maxdamantus: (boolean) true
<Maxdamantus>	indeed.
<xecycle>	sakitram: that's a complex problem, given that you have many ways to react to a click event.
<Maxdamantus>	WhitePride_: if you can remember doing "algebra" in high school, you might've seen it as < with an extra line parallel to the lower one.
<WhitePride_>	i don't remember algebra
<WhitePride_>	i kinda failed algebra :(
<sakitram>	I do not think so.. because it is just a alert("Hello buddy"); to be changed to alert("Hey buddy");.. no programmatical issue..   I just look for any tool/browser plugin that enables us to do so
<Maxdamantus>	Okay, well on paper it's usually written as < with an extra line parallel to the lower one or just horizontal below it.
<Maxdamantus>	≤
*	foooey is now known as fooey
<Maxdamantus>	I think I failed algebra in year 10 too.
<Maxdamantus>	no, year 11.
<sakitram>	@xecycle - is there any tool/plugin available for my type of requirement/
<xecycle>	sakitram: do not think it possible in browser.
<sakitram>	ok
<GreenJello>	sakitram, you can add additional JS to the page, would that work for you?
<sakitram>	GreenJello.. no it is not possible
<ljharb>	sakitram: what's the use case here
<ljharb>	changing an alert can't possibly be it
<sakitram>	it is just an example..
<ljharb>	so what are you actually doing.
<sakitram>	just checking the possibility of doing it .. if there is a webpage program of javascript and I want to  use it with customizing it
<sakitram>	without changing it in the server actually..
<sakitram>	since it is a javascript (ie client side script residing in our machine).. is it possible to alter and have instant reflection on the page..
<xecycle>	sakitram: build a proxy, and modify the script before sending to browser.
<sakitram>	I do not know about proxy

<sakitram>	one question, browser put the javascript file in local machine and then it is loaded into memory of the browser and running.. of it is loaded directly from server to the local machine browser and running (ie without any file created in local machine that is editable)?
<sakitram>	typo corrected*
<sakitram>	one question, browser put the javascript file in local machine and then it is loaded into memory of the browser and running.. OR* it is loaded directly from server to the local machine browser and running (ie without any file created in local machine that is editable)?
<GreenJello>	it runs in memory
<xecycle>	All programs must be loaded to memory to run.
<sakitram>	as per your answer that it is not possible... I think it is all loaded directly into browser
<sakitram>	I see
<GreenJello>	it's usually cached locally, but modifying that is impractical
<sakitram>	I get it now
<sakitram>	ok
<sakitram>	Thanks for clarification
<xecycle>	The problem is, "modify the program and see the effects on page" is not just modifying the program.  You have to revert all effects of the program, and restart over.
<sakitram>	yes, I know
<xecycle>	But no practical browsers offer the possibility to revert effects.
<sakitram>	ok
<GreenJello>	xecycle, you haven't tried react + webpack hot loader it seems :-)
<xecycle>	GreenJello: that's not browser effort.
<GreenJello>	true, although chrome has an api that I think allows you to modify the runtime...
<ljharb>	it attempts to
<ljharb>	but i can't possibly see how it manages to do that without violating the spec
<P1RATEZ>	he seems to want it to be done in realtime upon eavh visit, there is such a program aka. admuncher with live source code/script changes via network packet interception..issue lies with SSL based sites and tampering with modified/injected code
<GreenJello>	debuggers allow you to violate the spec, so *shrug*
<GreenJello>	P1RATEZ, I know you can terminate requests with extensions, but I don't think you can modify them
<GreenJello>	browsers could allow extensions to do that, though I don't think they do

<Alfio>	okay tank you
<niggler>	hello! does cordova work using the same JS engine that runs in the mobile web browser, or does it ship with its own engine?
<kevireilly_>	ah those flamecharts
<Alfio>	i think the best way is in group with students
<ljharb>	niggler: it most definitely uses whatever the device comes with
<niggler>	so in theory ljharb if some pure JS thing works in mobile safari, it should work in an app
<ljharb>	sort of. on ios, there's all sorts of quirks for webviews vs mobile safari.
<ljharb>	typically mobile safari gets access to more APIs, better speed optimizations, etc
<kevireilly_>	supposedly in iOS 8 native applications have been granted access to Nitro via UIWebView
<ljharb>	true
<gravity13>	I’m having trouble finding out what the -S argument is for npm, how would I go about learning that from the man? “npm -S -h” did not work, probably because -S is a modifier
<ljharb>	in what context did you see it
<gravity13>	https://www.npmjs.com/package/es6-class-mixin
<ljharb>	but i'm almost certain it's a shortcut for --save
<ljharb>	yep, that's it
<ljharb>	`npm install --save` is the full form
<ljharb>	but also, that package looks awful
<gravity13>	ah, I guess you’d be a good person to ask. That module isn’t working for me because it’s being loaded (via browserify) without transform to js
<kevireilly_>	niggler: if you’re looking for additional integration between js and objc, check out JavaScriptCore
<cj3kim>	yo anyone know what's the average js payload size for a SPA?
<gravity13>	do I need to transform it myself or should the owner of that repo provided it in vanilla js?
<ljharb>	gravity13: unfortunately it looks like it's published un-transformed
<ljharb>	the owner should transform it before publishing.
<gravity13>	cool. That’s what I thought.
<niggler>	kevireilly_: someone reported an issue when using a library in cordova, but it works in mobile safari and chrome, so I was wondering whether the engines were different
<niggler>	but from the sounds of it, a pure JS thing that works in mobile safari and chrome theoretically should work in cordova
<kevireilly_>	I think they don’t accept custom browsers, so Chrome as an example is basically a safari wrapper
<kevireilly_>	in theory should be the same UIWebView that Chrome uses, but there are some subtle differences
<kevireilly_>	what sort of issue is it?
<ljharb>	chrome on ios is a safari wrapper.

<kevireilly_>	Maybe it is the glob pattern *Spec.coffee?
<greves>	is there a better syntax for `var` where i can just edit one line at a time if i need to change something? i was thinking maybe like this: https://bpaste.net/show/0ec6eff643e3
<greves>	then the only thing to check is that the last line doesn't have a comma
<kevireilly_>	you can do exactly that
<greves>	i see a lot of people doing the hanging commas underneath the `r` in `var` but i just think it looks messy
<kevireilly_>	greves: a lot of people also do it like this https://bpaste.net/show/470ba23e6825
<greves>	kevireilly_, yeah thats what i normally do but i dont like that the topmost var is more difficult to edit
<greves>	like sometimes i want to just rearrange them in alphabetical order and the top one always takes longer
<kevireilly_>	some poeple recommend the traditional style for ease of editing
<greves>	yeah, that's probably my favorite at the moment which is why i'm looking for other options because i dont really like that one either
<greves>	too many `var`s, its cleaner conceptually to me to just have one or a few for different 'sections'
<greves>	i think i'm gonna try it like the one you pasted but with the top line hanging and only a 2-space indent
<greves>	so like the one i originally pasted but leave the last semicolon
<ljharb>	greves: just do 1 variable per var
<ljharb>	greves: makes using the debugger easier.
<prohobo>	"1 variable per var" wat
<greves>	hmm
<greves>	true i didn't think about the debugger
<xecycle>	I am 1 variable per var, except for: `var foo, bar; before(function() { foo = ...; bar=...; });`
<ljharb>	yeah, actually i do that too
<ljharb>	i do `var a, b, c;` for simple var declarations, but `var d = foo; var e = bar;` for declarations with assignments.
<ljharb>	it also resolves debates about "how do you indent them"
<greves>	i can remove 'use strict'; when babel com/transpiling right?
<ljharb>	why would you want to
<ljharb>	strict mode ftw
<greves>	i thought babel added it automatically in es6 mode?
<xecycle>	well `babel </dev/null` -> `"use strict";`
<ljharb>	greves: it probably does
<ljharb>	why would you want to remove it tho?
<ljharb>	you should make sure it's in the final transpiled output
<greves>	ljharb, well no harm in leaving it but also no point in having it if babel adds it automatically and i'm babeling everything :P
<ljharb>	it's explicit.
<ljharb>	good to leave it in.
<ljharb>	babel would only add it automatically for `class` and `module` code.

<falafel>	jeanre, where are you adding the event?
<jeanre>	on click of an i tag
<vileRaisin>	jeanre, I've never seen this download property
<falafel>	jeanre, also, element.click is not a thing
<BenL90>	xecycle: change div margin a div with class
<falafel>	download is a property of <a>
<jeanre>	I am creating a a tag

<jeanre>	*an a tag :P
<falafel>	!onfoo @ jeanre
<ecmabot>	jeanre: Using ".onclick", ".onchange", or "on" anything is bad practice and results in poorly factored, hard-to-manage code; as well as limiting you to one event listener per event. Consider attaching your events with addEventListener, instead, eg: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener
<jeanre>	http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_download.asp

<falafel>	!w3schools @ jeanre
<ecmabot>	jeanre: W3Schools is not related to the W3C and has many problems: http://w3fools.com/
<vileRaisin>	jeanre, you append this to the DOM right
<jeanre>	falafel ok can you suggest the way to do it
<vileRaisin>	because it's not in your paste
<falafel>	jeanre, check the links I posted, you'll find your way there
<falafel>	jeanre, if you have any problems, come back with a demo in jsfiddle.net, so we can reproduce the issue
<vileRaisin>	if you're going to trigger the click anyway
<vileRaisin>	you should not trigger a click on an element
<jeanre>	the element is no in the DOM
<vileRaisin>	instead just change the location.href
<jeanre>	because its a link that expires
<jeanre>	so I cannot add the link to the DOM on load
<jeanre>	it downloads the file fine
<jeanre>	it just does not change the file name to the name I am specifying in the download attribute
<vileRaisin>	I'm not sure why you're doing it this way at all
<vileRaisin>	if you want to download something, just do it directly
<falafel>	what do you expect .click to do? again, that is not an attribute that exists
<jeanre>	falafel IT works fine
<jeanre>	except for the download attribute is being ignored
<jeanre>	does this make sense?
<falafel>	how did you add the event?
<BenL90>	xecycle: I'll sent the IP to you, Working on Joomla
<falafel>	and also triggering a click event doesn't trigger the link behavior, so it won't trigger a download, no, and it won't trigger a change in location href
<vileRaisin>	jeanre, just make a PHP script that does a CP on the file
<jeanre>	falafel it has nothing to do with the element itself
<falafel>	jeanre, post a demo, you are not being very clear here, and your code is incomplete, and looks incorrect
<falafel>	try jsfiddle
<vileRaisin>	falafel: he's using a new attribute that renames the file when downloading it
<vileRaisin>	and he's saying it doesn't work
<jeanre>	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/click
<jeanre>	click event is fine
<falafel>	ok, but "However, bubbling of a click event will not cause an <a> element to initiate navigation as if a real mouse-click had been received."
<vileRaisin>	jeanre, I would advice you not to expect the download attribute to work as you intend it to
<vileRaisin>	if you really want this specific behaviour, do it on the filesystem
<falafel>	if you want to trigger it with JS, I suppose you need to change the location on your own
<jeanre>	ok
<jeanre>	its fine
<falafel>	according to what I read, the event handler is what .click, will trigger presumably, not the behavior of the link itself

<stalkr_>	I'm trying to get more into modules in the browser, what do people use? CommonJS, AMD, RequireJS, Browserify, webpack? I'm lost, what should I be using. Is AMD the cool thing to use because it's async?
<falafel>	well, the new shiny toy thing is SystemJS, but I think Browserify is def the way to go for now
<stalkr_>	falafel: Why Browserify and not RequireJS/webpack? I'll have to look up SystemJS
<_rgn>	browserify is at least quite simple
<falafel>	yes, it is simple, and it has watchify. RequireJS and AMD are too tedious, you can use Browserify + amdify or almondify or whatever the name is to generate other formats
<stalkr_>	_rgn: true but that has to do with trying to only do one thing, right? webpack for example does tons of stuff using loaders (looks like the same with SystemJS)
<substack>	most of the code you would want to use (npm packages) is written in commonjs
<stalkr_>	I thought Browserify/CommonJS was in and that's what people did today but as I look for more and more examples/tutorials I see AMD so I'm getting confused
<stalkr_>	Most modules using CommonJS is a good selling point as most will work but if I were to write my own, then I'm not sure
<substack>	stalkr_: what is the outcome you wish to obtain?
<falafel>	stalkr_, it doesn't really matter, the idea of using Browserify is to get npm into your workflow, but all these formats can be converted to the others using tools
*	Onionnio_ is now known as Onionnion
<stalkr_>	substack: Right now I'm trying to write a small Backbone app for a project. For that I'm just using CommonJS modules, as that's what I know (heard most of)
<stalkr_>	but it's a personal project, not supposed to be published or anything
<falafel>	so you are already using browserify?
<stalkr_>	Actually webpack but guess I could easily been using Browserify instead
<stalkr_>	Not sure if I'm going to need the loaders later for say Sass
<falafel>	what is this loaders thing? I'm not very familiar with Webpack
<xecycle>	it is like, require("style!css!./style.css") --- css-loader parses for url(...) and include those assets, style-loader inserts the stylesheet as a style tag.
<stalkr_>	falafel: http://webpack.github.io/docs/loaders.html basically they preprocess files, guess it lets you skip using say Gulp for some stuff
<substack>	so weird
<stalkr_>	I think the idea is to decrease number of HTTP requests? Not too sure what the motivation is
<falafel>	ah, I see... mmm, not a big fan of strings for that kind of stuff, I'd rather use gulp, or npm scripts
<falafel>	this looks weird `require("style!css!less!bootstrap/less/bootstrap.less");`
<substack>	require() means something very concrete, to put extra shit in there will just make things much more difficult later on
<substack>	like when you want to run something from node or publish to npm
<stalkr_>	Yes, that's what turns some people off from webpack, it messes with their require
<falafel>	I've been trying jspm, and it looks pretty nice, but I'm not sure it is ready
<xecycle>	but you can define rules in the webpack config, so that /\.less$/ automatically uses style!css!less.  And you write require("bootstrap/less/bootstrap.less") in code.
<falafel>	it is still messing with require though, does this affect the dependency graph?
<stalkr_>	From what I gathered, another difference between CommonJS/AMD is the latter is able to spit code out into chunks that makes load on demand possible? So say I don't need a module until I hit page /admin, the code won't get read/loaded until I go to that page, is that correct?
<xecycle>	dependency graph?  it depends on how you draw it, I guess.
<xecycle>	stalkr_: no; afaik webpack is able to split chunks up.  And it supports CommonJS for this.
<falafel>	xecycle, say I use this tool? https://github.com/pahen/madge. Would webpack's patched `require` affect the output of this graph?
<stalkr_>	I see
<substack>	stalkr_: https://www.npmjs.com/package/factor-bundle
<xecycle>	falafel: hmm if it drops files it cannot parse I guess those just become unresolved dependencies.
<stalkr_>	substack: Ahh cool, when I learned about Browserify it didn't sound that was possible (at the time it sounded like one big bundle.js file was possible only)
<stalkr_>	Not sure if that hasn't been true for a long time or since ever
<sonthonax>	In es6 is there a way to do ‘import x as y’
<xecycle>	sonthonax: import {x as y} from "foo" or import y from "foo"
<sonthonax>	xecycle: it has to be in curly braces?
<vileRaisin>	that's for multiple object sonthonax
<falafel>	sonthonax, what does the module export?
<xecycle>	sonthonax: depends on what your module is like.
<sonthonax>	export model {x:y};
<falafel>	import y from "foo" === import {default as y} from "foo"
<sonthonax>	export struct {a:b}
<falafel>	uh?
<stalkr_>	There is going way too much on in the JS world, capacity overload
<sonthonax>	That’s what my model looks like.
<stalkr_>	One day people will revert to http://vanilla-js.com/
<falafel>	stalkr_, this is vanilla js
<vileRaisin>	haha yeah
<falafel>	if you mean ppl will go back to not using tooling, and doing everything by hand, I doubt it
<falafel>	the complexity of the ecosystem means more to learn, but also less to do
<BenL901>	xecycle: Hello bro.. and why my code not running?
<xecycle>	BenL901: did you correct your mistakes and try again?
<stalkr_>	falafel: It was more of a joke, I doubt too people will drop their fancy tools. Just saying so much is going on, hard to keep track
<sonthonax>	xecycle: that syntax doesn’t work because I’m not exporting a set of objects.
<falafel>	sonthonax, a set of objects?
<vileRaisin>	you're always exporting objects
<falafel>	sonthonax, exports is already an object, so you always export an object anyway
<sonthonax>	I’m exporting mutiple things.
<falafel>	ok, so the destructuring syntax you can use it
<sonthonax>	It’s a syntax error.

<sonthonax>	Are you curious what they do?
<vileRaisin>	export var options = {}
<falafel>	ah, you missed the var
<xecycle>	BenL901: define "move to"?
<falafel>	and the assignment
<BenL901>	xecycle: What's that actually?
<sonthonax>	falafel: no I didn’t ‘miss the var’. It’s valid es6
<falafel>	export takes an expression afaik, `model t.struct` is not a valid expression
<sonthonax>	Yes it is.
<falafel>	oh, it is?
<xecycle>	BenL901: what do you mean by "move to"?  To 150px left of current position?
<sonthonax>	I can import model with `import model from  ‘../module/thisModule’
<vileRaisin>	sonthonax: I'm pretty sure your export statement is invalid

<vileRaisin>	well then just do import {model as foo}
<BenL901>	xecycle: yes, move 150 to left because the element is overfloq hidden, i wanna make a slidder actually
<falafel>	I don't see how that can be valid, I may be missing something here
<vileRaisin>	well your model may be valid because its a function
<_rgn>	what does es6 import syntax bring over commonjs require?
<vileRaisin>	oh no it isn't
<vileRaisin>	well ok, it's magic
<mokush>	is there a way I could figure out if a script was added with the script tag in the head or in the body, inside the script file?
<falafel>	`model t.struct` and `options {` are not valid expression
<vileRaisin>	magic
<falafel>	I don't see it, and Babel seems to agree
<sonthonax>	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export
<vileRaisin>	sonthonax:
<vileRaisin>	what is the problem
<sonthonax>	I’d just like to be able to import model as something else.
<falafel>	sonthonax, I'd read thru this http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html
<vileRaisin>	when importing, just import the object and use as to declare them as a different variable
<sonthonax>	Never mind.
<xecycle>	BenL901: work out a way to control position of the element, e.g. absolute position with left property, and always change that property.
<vileRaisin>	import { model as foo }
<sonthonax>	vileRaisin: that won’t work. That requires that I have export default…
<falafel>	sonthonax, what are you using to compile ES6?
<sonthonax>	babel.
<falafel>	then I don't get it, I copy/pasted your thing, and I get a SyntaxError, it is not compiling, and I don't see the syntax you mention in any documentation
*	outpatient is now known as inpatient
<sonthonax>	falafel: have you ever gone ‘export function xy()’ ?
<falafel>	yes
<vileRaisin>	sonthonax: sounds like your es6 is living in a different dimension
<sonthonax>	because that’s conceptually the same as ‘export xy {}’
<BenL901>	xecycle: How to add left property, before i wanna try it but nothing happend to
<BenL901>	using left
<falafel>	using babel 5.2.17, with `export xy {}`, I get SyntaxError
<vileRaisin>	export default is when you just have one object, or you want the default to be a specific object
<xecycle>	BenL901: abs position+left is just an option.  Have you any idea how that element is controlled its position?  margins also work, as long as you get the other stuffs right.
<vileRaisin>	it has nothing to do with exporting with a destructuring statement
<BenL901>	xecycle: I Have no idea
<xecycle>	BenL901: ok, take a CSS course, seriously.
<vileRaisin>	maybe you're trying to do typescript or something, I don't know, but even typescript is similar to es6 in this respect
<falafel>	sonthonax, where are you getting this syntax from? can you link to some documentation?
<jamieshepherd>	Hey, https://ghostbin.com/paste/fcos9 my problem is this line throws undefined in the console if the value doesn't exist
<falafel>	export let options = {}
<falafel>	that would make sense
<falafel>	but `export options {}`?
<sonthonax>	falafel: I don’t know. I thought it would follow naturally, and it worked.
<falafel>	how it worked? what version of babel? Again, I copy/pasted `export xy {}`, tried compiling, and get syntax error
<sonthonax>	I’m using babelify 5.0.4
<sonthonax>	babel 4.6.16
<falafel>	try upgrading your Babel
<falafel>	that may actually be a bug
<falafel>	because I don't think that's compliant with the spec
<BenL901>	xecycle
<BenL901>	xecycle
<sonthonax>	Ugh, work.
<xecycle>	BenL901: ?
<BenL901>	xecycle: No i mean i have no idea to edit it using the JS, but if css i can
<falafel>	sonthonax, read this, really, if it is not in there, it is not in the spec http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html
<sonthonax>	falafel: what’s the edge version of babel?
<xecycle>	BenL901: so you know how to move it 150px left in css?
<falafel>	current version is 5.2.17 afaik
<vileRaisin>	export var options = {}; export function model(){}; import {model as foo, options as bar} from ...
<vileRaisin>	done
<BenL901>	xecycle: Oh my head got ache... you mean just add the position and add the left...
<BenL901>	xecycle: Of course i know... just my webpage using margin auto, on content and the DIV is inside the div #div content
<xecycle>	BenL901: no, I mean to work out how to move that in CSS, and mirror that to JS.
<BenL901>	xecycle: problem is I don't the JS syntax
<BenL901>	xecycle: i have search online
<xecycle>	BenL901: you are sure setting `margin-left: -150px;` does the trick?  Then .marginLeft="-150px"
<Guest8893>	Hi, this is driving me crazy. Am trying to sort an array low to high, this is my code. http://codepad.org/FGJmNR7P
<Guest8893>	However, the array stays unchanegd
<jamieshepherd>	Hey, https://ghostbin.com/paste/fcos9 my problem is this line throws undefined in the console if the value doesn't exist
<BenL901>	yes actually, i have try it on Inspector, that works, the consept is make a div hiddent and just show some part of it
<Guest8893>	ah nvm
<BenL901>	xecycle: BTW there's an error on the console js
<xecycle>	BenL901: I told you to correct -150px -> "-150px" --- quote it.  it's a string.  did you try?
<BenL901>	xecycle: Oh i miss that part -____- sorry master
<xecycle>	BenL901: I'm off work and leaving.  As you progress, post updated fiddle here and expect someone to answer.  bye

<PHPLearner>	hi everyone
<PHPLearner>	I got this input button
<PHPLearner>	<input id="button1" type="button" style="font-size:30px; font-weight:bold;" value="0">
<PHPLearner>	and this is my jquery:
<PHPLearner>	    $("#button1").click(function() {	
<PHPLearner>	        alert("Hello!");
<PHPLearner>	    });
<PHPLearner>	is does not seem to work
<PHPLearner>	can anyone please tell me what went wrong here
<jerrt>	PHPLearner: it appears to work fine, there might be something else going wrong
<jerrt>	check the console output to see if there's some other error
<PHPLearner>	there is no error
<vileRaisin>	what is your html like
<PHPLearner>	that's is why I am wondering where I got it wrong
<jerrt>	is it in the correct order?
<jerrt>	the JS might be executing before the html has loaded
<vileRaisin>	are you sure this is run after onload
<jerrt>	https://jsfiddle.net/fatL357j/ <
<vileRaisin>	and are you sure that element exists
<PHPLearner>	jquery is loaded at the bottom
<vileRaisin>	could you put this in a fiddle, there is nothing wrong with the piece you pasted
<jerrt>	or paste the entire page into a pastebin
<PHPLearner>	that is placed inside $(document).read(function(){})
<vileRaisin>	.ready
<jerrt>	^
<PHPLearner>	yup sorry .ready
<jerrt>	so yeah, paste the rest in to see
<PHPLearner>	vileRaisin: http://pastebin.com/373SDDHU
<vileRaisin>	seems alright, try $( function(){ $('#button1').on('click', function(){ this.value++ }) } )
<vileRaisin>	maybe you have a syntax error in your javascript
<vileRaisin>	your html isn't completely right though, you have a stray <div class="container">
<vileRaisin>	at the end
<PHPLearner>	https://jsfiddle.net/vn8uvcxs/
<PHPLearner>	that is the jsfiddle
<vileRaisin>	that fiddle works fine
<vileRaisin>	I'm guessing maybe your HTML is invalid and it doesn't load in jQuery for some reason
<vileRaisin>	or maybe jQuery isn't loaded because the file isn't there
<falafel>	yeah, that's not how you use fiddle anyway, check your html, the console, etc

<ashnur>	one we knew was invalid, but now someone actually checked it :)
<PHPLearner>	how else can I debug my project no error is ever shown on the console
<vileRaisin>	PHPLearner: I think you need to check if the HTML errors are at fault
<vileRaisin>	try to fix your HTML because currently it is not valid
<ashnur>	PHPLearner: write debugger into the code, open the dev console, run the script (refresh the page, or click the button, whatever it has to happen), and then step through your code and check the variables. you can also set conditional expressions on breakpoints in the browser, so they only pause the execution if  some variable has the specific value (usually == null) you are debugging
<ashnur>	also, in 2015 i refuse to even open pastebin links

<PHPLearner>	ashnur: ok
<PHPLearner>	sorry
<vileRaisin>	PHPLearner: https://validator.w3.org/
<vileRaisin>	solve those problems
<ashnur>	no need to be sorry, nothing is your fault or anything, I just want you to use a better platform to debug/ask for help. sharing static snippets of code is not enough nowadays
<PHPLearner>	ashnur: how can use the debugger in firefox
<ashnur>	you don't. firefox is a second grade browser nowadays. you want to use a webkit browser, chromium or such, because the developer tools are way better in that.
<luser_>	Hi guys. Is anyone familiar with aws-sdk-js?
<PHPLearner>	vileRaisin: the thing is it is difficult to do that because an MVC framework is being used here

<sonthonax>	Why is javascript generally typed camelcase.
<sonthonax>	(personally I find it really hard to read and not as vertisile)
<prohobo>	because efffff youuuuu
<prohobo>	just the way people like to code in js
<prohobo>	dashes for dom element names
<Sharaal>	sonthonax: whats the alternative for you, underscore delimiter? camelcase is just the common thing most ppl use in some languages
<prohobo>	dashes and underscores rather
<prohobo>	and dashes for css classes

<NikoZz>	how do you think is faster to create svg graphics? Using js (and d3js for example) or using php and ajax?

<mentallyLessor>	im mentally afk today, can any of you help me with adding to an array? I have an event_arr that looks like the following: http://pastebin.com/UENBAYU2 - i want to push objects from a mysql db to this array, but i cannot figure out how to do it properly
<sonthonax>	I have a rest api design question.
<sonthonax>	I have a one-to-one resource.
<NikoZz>	ashnur: I mean in case of complex svgs, in which case will the graphics load faster
<sonthonax>	That may or may not exist.
<sonthonax>	It it worth having a seperation between post or put?
<ashnur>	NikoZz: neither. for example in firefox it's so slow, you want to cry
<NikoZz>	so what should I do? :|
<ashnur>	NikoZz: anyway, i would go with the js version first because it's easier, there are more tools (d3 for example but less frameworky libs too, much more than for php)
<ashnur>	NikoZz: well, if you just want to show svg, just show some and after that do some tests if its fast enough, it will probably be fast enough
<NikoZz>	hahaha ok
<NikoZz>	good point..
<mentallyLessor>	http://pastebin.com/7B1CnXEN anyone who can help me figure out how to push correctly ?
<ashnur>	don't overthink it, just do the easiest simplest way with js, and then see if there is anything wrong. without data, analysis is just a waste of time :)
<NikoZz>	yeah you are right.. I ve already done it using both ways, and js seems really fast, but my PC is really fast too, thats why I asked :|
<NikoZz>	which design pattern do you prefer for web applications? (I know that my question is too general, but im new in js)
<Sharaal>	NikoZz: depends on what kind of web application, seo optimized landingpages needs server side rendering. application clients needs not much server side things, but benefit of a single page app framework. application servers not need server side rendering, only an api to exchange data with clients

<tumulte>	hello !
<tumulte>	how do I unit test a method that spits HTML ?
<javascript608>	Hello to everyone ; do you know how to empty an HTML code thanks to jQuery but conserving the CSS code please ? :-)
<javascript452>	hi there! a basic question from a newbie: in the object literal notation how can one compute on properties values? { someKey: function() {do some computing; return results} } return someKey function
<GreenJello>	.empty() ?
<javascript608>	GreenJello: ahah, empty removes CSS
<javascript608>	GreenJello: :/
<GreenJello>	put the css in the <head>
<alyson>	hi
<javascript608>	GreenJello: I don't want, it's impossible
<javascript608>	GreenJello: the html tag style is absolutely necessary
<GreenJello>	style attributes?
<javascript608>	y
<javascript608>	yes
<GreenJello>	you can't remove elements and keep their attributes, it's just no how it works
<javascript608>	i thought jquery was able to
<GreenJello>	it just doesn't make sense, where would the attributes go?
<ankr>	javascript608 attributes belongs to an element, so removing the element will remove the attributes with it
<javascript608>	GreenJello: in an array for example
<javascript608>	ankr: i know
<GreenJello>	javascript399, okay, so get the style attribute of each element, put them in an array, and then .empty()
<GreenJello>	608*
<javascript608>	but jquery could create a function that removes the html but conserves the style attribute in an array
<javascript608>	yes but...
<javascript608>	jquery has to do it :(
<GreenJello>	no, you have to do it
<GreenJello>	that's not something that's useful to most people
<javascript608>	GreenJello: :/
<GreenJello>	javascript452, like a getter?
<GreenJello>	tumulte, you could assert the value is the same as what you expect
<tumulte>	GreenJello: nice nick
<GreenJello>	tumulte, assert.equal(myThing(), '<...>')
<ankr>	lol how many javascript\d+ ppl in here :P
<tumulte>	GreenJello: but what if it's a huge ass dom
<GreenJello>	ankr, now only two :-)
<tumulte>	like a template with a lotta stuffs
<GreenJello>	tumulte, break it into smaller functions
<GreenJello>	and you can load the dom, and make assertions about the variable parts
<javascript452>	GreenJello: I'm not sure if I understand... Instead of attributing a string (someKey: "string") or passing an already declared object (someKey: obj) I want to make some processing on the obj and then return it to someKey
<GreenJello>	you generally have to assume your template is correct in the simplest situation, and then test that the variations are correct
<GreenJello>	javascript452, you could do that before the object literal, and put the result in a variable
<GreenJello>	and then do {someKey: thatVariable}

<suvek>	hi i m new to programming..do u think javascript is good for my first language?
<SuperHeroINTJ>	yes.
<suvek>	SuperHeroINTJ, why?
<bberry>	suvek, it is forgiving and welcoming to new programmers. however, be sure to do your research, as there are a lot of pitfalls/bad habits in js.
<SuperHeroINTJ>	suvek, it is easy, it works, you can use same language in client (browser) and server (node.js), it is async by default (better IO handling).
<lyou333l>	Feelings on typescript?
<bberry>	suvek, Also, its not a strongly typed language, which is nice for new developers
<ankr>	suvek it's easy to get started with javascript compared to many other languages. You can use it on many platforms - and the development in the community is quite impressive.
<Hannibal_Smith>	SuperHeroINTJ, I would argue that async by default is a positive thing for a person who is learning programming
<bberry>	suvek, type !books to see the books that we recommend.  i think eloquent is our most commonly referred book.
<SuperHeroINTJ>	suvek, I suggest you to learn by Code Academy course (http://www.codecademy.com/pt-BR/tracks/javascript). And use MDN as refference (https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript/).
<SuperHeroINTJ>	Hannibal_Smith, better to start right than go evil paths. ;)
<suvek>	SuperHeroINTJ, thanks..
<SuperHeroINTJ>	suvek, the async thing is tricky, commands are added to a 'queue', and they might be processed later, so they don't actually happen in order, but a 'callback' is used for "calling back" once command was executed.
<SuperHeroINTJ>	Hannibal_Smith, now he is ready for async. =D
<Sorella>	suvek: particularly I'd recommend going through How To Design Programs if you're just starting with programming.
<Sorella>	suvek: it uses Racket, which isn't quite as mainstream, but is a better language overall if you're just starting out, and has a better environment for learning
*	lance|afk is now known as lanceball
*	zcm is now known as Guest89980
<Sorella>	SuperHeroINTJ: async is super easy, actually. JS just doesn't have a good support for it
<SuperHeroINTJ>	Sorella, how would a good support be?
<SuperHeroINTJ>	*would be
<Sorella>	SuperHeroINTJ: async/await in C#, CSP in Clojure, or monadic sequencing in Scala, Purr, Mermaid, Haskell.
<Sorella>	SuperHeroINTJ: monadic sequencing, in particular, looks like this: https://github.com/robotlolita/raven/blob/master/source/scripts/novel.sjs#L103-L111, async/await like this: http://jakearchibald.com/2014/es7-async-functions/, and CSP like this: http://www.infoq.com/presentations/clojure-core-async
<Sorella>	There are other things that are less common, like delimited continuations and what not, which are also cool.

<SuperHeroINTJ>	Sorella, the problem i'm having with promises in JS is how to return more than one argument.

<SuperHeroINTJ>	I see.
<quetzakubica>	I've found such code explaining functional reactive programming in js http://jsfiddle.net/staltz/8jFJH/48/, it's ok but one thing bothers me, it looks like its dependency direction is wrong, I mean that abstractions depends upon details. Is that common with FRP or is it just bad code?
<quetzakubica>	There is tutorial for this code https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754
<Sorella>	quetzakubica: Reactive Programming and FRP are completely different things. Rx, Bacon, etc. are not FRP
<Sorella>	quetzakubica: not sure what you mean by "dependency direction is wrong" though
<quetzakubica>	Sorella: completely? it has nothing to do with it?
<Sorella>	quetzakubica: yes.
<Sorella>	FRP isn't used outside of Haskell and academia anyway
<quetzakubica>	Sorella: I mean that business logic has knowledge about what button has to be clicked  in example
<SuperHeroINTJ>	Sorella, I'm using your method now and it is working. ;)
<Sorella>	"""""business logic""""" is such an awful term
<SuperHeroINTJ>	What is the correct term?
<quetzakubica>	domain logic?
<Sorella>	quetzakubica: in any case, nothing needs to know anything. Rx just models the world as streams of discrete events over time. And you can pass streams around in any way you want (since they're first-class).

<Sorella>	sange: yeah, just saying I dislike the term really :P
<quetzakubica>	zap0: abstraction is a curse? so design by contract is also a curse?
<quetzakubica>	Sorella: how would you name "business logic" ?
<Sorella>	zap0: http://lambdatoast.com/programming/2014/09/20/the-point-of-abstraction.html
<inkbottle>	Hi, to a given web  page I want to associate this script: "document.body.style.fontFamily = "serif""; I'd prefer not to use greasemonkey, if possible
<zap0>	quetzakubica, abstraction is almost always a loss of information.  programming a computer is all about concrete information.
<Sorella>	quetzakubica: "logic"
<luser_>	Hey guys, is anyone familiar with aws-sdk-js library?
<Sorella>	zap0: good luck writing a different + function for every number in existence.
<Docmarten>	morning all.
<DragonPunch>	I attach a file using <input type="file> tag how do I send that file over via XMLHTTP Req
<Docmarten>	I am trying to consolidate 5 functions into one.  All 5 contact the same external api and pass slightly different info in the data: { prodID : "blah" , requestID: "12345", etc }.  Can I somehow use an array to store the Data IDs?  ie: data: { $array[0] : "blah", $array[3] : "12345", etc }  ???
<pandeiro>	anyone using MediumEditor.js know a way to add image insertion? There's a plugin available but it depends on 4-5 large libs including jquery-ui, I'd like to avoid that.
<Sorella>	pandeiro: this one? https://github.com/daviferreira/medium-editor
<nbt>	Docmarten: data[$array[0]]="blah"; data[$array[3]]="12345"
<quetzakubica>	Sorella: do You think it's possible to write functional app in js in such way that guys coming from OOP would understand what code does just by looking at it?
<quetzakubica>	because I amn trying to do that :P
<DragonPunch>	okay so or my server i am gettign a 500 server error
<quetzakubica>	when I looked at functional app in first place, I had no idea what it does until I grasped some FP concepts
<DragonPunch>	and it's not helpful at all, since it's too vague.
<DragonPunch>	is there a way to get something more specific
<Sorella>	quetzakubica: "do you think it's possible to write ancient English, such that 10 year olds would understand what it says just by looking at it"?
*	Maxdamantus wonders what ancient English is.
<Maxdamantus>	There's Anglisc/Old English, which is about 1300 years old.
<Sorella>	That's ancient! :P
<Maxdamantus>	(it's not really English though—it's closer to Icelandic)
<quetzakubica>	Sorella: ancient ended in 772 or something :P
<quetzakubica>	when Rome fell I believe
*	Maxdamantus wonders if it's called something else in Icelandic.
<Maxdamantus>	Fornenska
<quetzakubica>	476 it was, sorry
<Docmarten>	Maxdamantus : I believe that is the version of English where all the vowels are reversed from what they are today.
<Maxdamantus>	Docmarten: reversed?
<Maxdamantus>	Docmarten: you might be thinking of the great vowel shift.
<Maxdamantus>	Docmarten: which mostly resulted in long vowels being diphthongised.
<Maxdamantus>	(if people say "long vowel" informally in English, they might be referring to diphthongs that used to be actual long vowels)
<Docmarten>	possibly.
<quetzakubica>	Sorella: anyway, I would like to write functional code in a manner described by Literal programming.
<quetzakubica>	Literate
*	DeviaVir_ is now known as DeviaVir
<Sorella>	quetzakubica: it won't help people understand the abstractions you're using, if they're not familiar with it. Unless you turn all your programs into a paper that describes all of them, but then it's easier to just not use any of those abstractions
<quetzakubica>	I get it. Then it will be a hard way to make my coworkers turn to FP :P
<jaawerth>	well, they should understand what the higher-level functions do just based on function name and the like. They'll have a harder time putting together how they're constructed/composed, though
<jaawerth>	but that's one of the benefits of FP, programs end up looking more like doLaunchry().and(walkTheDog())
<zap0>	Sorella, wow! it's almost like you're arguing that abstractions are a curse
<Sorella>	Yeah, they should be able to get the general idea what it does
<Sorella>	zap0: you should read what I said again
<jaawerth>	laundry*
<ClamsCasino>	:|
<quetzakubica>	jaawerth: that is the only thing I want
<quetzakubica>	jaawerth: it has to say explicitly what we get in result, not how it does it
<jaawerth>	it's just they'll get more confused when they see let doLaundry = compose(dry, wash)(clothes)
<quetzakubica>	but when I look at haskell code in example, it looks like mess
<quetzakubica>	exactly
<jaawerth>	but even that you can kind of figure out
<jaawerth>	even if you'd be confused why the wash and dry functions are "backwards"
<Sorella>	That's why I prefer Purr. You'd write that as `let clothes do-laundry = clothes wash dry`
<quetzakubica>	Sorella: I don't get it all :P
<Sorella>	quetzakubica: dry(wash(clothes))
<Sorella>	It's just a functional language with OO syntax :P
<zomg>	doLaundry = dry . wash ? :P
<jaawerth>	how does one tell the argument apart from the composed functions? what if the argument comes later?
<jaawerth>	suppose I could just read the Purr docs
<Sorella>	jaawerth: you have the ->> and <<- operators for composing functions, but mostly you'd just use the same thing as Clojure's / Scala's placeholders
<quetzakubica>	Sorella  I didn't get "let clothes do-laundry" part
<Sorella>	(_ + 1) ->> (3 / _) <| 2
<jaawerth>	ah
<MasterKwoth>	hello, i have a class function(){ this.arr = [], this.func = function(){ console.log(this.arr}} it says this.arr is undefined WTF, but i can acces non-array properties using this
<quetzakubica>	do-laundry is a function, ok, but why clothes is before it
<Sorella>	quetzakubica: that's a function definition. You define functions in the same syntax you use for calling them
<quetzakubica>	ah
<Sorella>	So `let a f = ...` you call it as `arg f`. `let a + b = ...`, you call it as `arg + arg`, and `let a foo: b bar: c = ...`, you call it as `arg foo: arg bar: arg`
<zomg>	MasterKwoth: `this` doesn't work that cleanly in JS I'm afraid.
<livcd>	can somebody explain me the concept of virtual dom ?
<sonthonax>	In react js sometimes I like to wrap my components in generator functions, is this okay?
<Golynx>	why does Chrome and Opera delete the Web SQL database after the page that created it is refreshed ?
<Sorella>	!this @ MasterKwoth
<ecmabot>	MasterKwoth: If a function call is of the form `a.b()`, `this` will be the object you accessed the "b" property from. Otherwise, if it's of the form `a()`, `this` will be `undefined`, which is turned into the global object if the function isn't in strict mode. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/08/30/understanding-javascripts-this/
<Sorella>	!classes @ MasterKwoth
<ecmabot>	MasterKwoth: Class hierarchies? Don't do that! http://raganwald.com/2014/03/31/class-hierarchies-dont-do-that.html (See also, !inheritance)
<Sorella>	Hm, not that
<Sorella>	MasterKwoth: JS doesn't have classes.
<Sorella>	MasterKwoth: http://raganwald.com/2015/05/11/javascript-classes.html
<MasterKwoth>	i have a cloud 'class'
<sonthonax>	Sorella: a class is simply a blueprint for an object. Many things can behave as classes. Even though javascript doesn’t explicitly have ‘classes’ some prototype patterns are exactly the same things. It’s pedantic to say javascript doens’t have classes imo.
<MasterKwoth>	and i want to inherit from that 'class'
<Sorella>	sonthonax: read that article
<Sorella>	MasterKwoth: in JS you've got objects, and objects inherit directly from other objects. You construct objects that serve as "models" for new objects, clone existing objects, and modify them.
<Sorella>	>> var a = { a: 1 }; var b = Object.create(a); b.b = 2; [b.a, b.b]
<ecmabot>	Sorella: (object) [1, 2]
<Sorella>	!oop @ MasterKwoth
<ecmabot>	MasterKwoth: http://robotlolita.me/2011/10/09/understanding-javascript-oop.html summarizes Object Oriented Programming in Javascript, using concepts from ECMAScript 5, and relating them back to older paradigms from ECMAScript 3
<sonthonax>	Sorella: classes are just ways of defining datastructures.
<Sorella>	sonthonax: no.
<sonthonax>	You define them then...
<Sorella>	sonthonax: there's a well-defined meaning of classes in literature (which that article will give you), and it's not just "defining data structures." Otherwise we should be calling C structs and Haskell's ADTs "classes" as well (and Self's objects, ofc)
<sonthonax>	Sorella: you can implement classes with C structs with function pointers.
<Sorella>	sonthonax: sure, the same way you can encode functions in x86 assembly or even Brainfuck. That doesn't mean that either x86 assembly or Brainfuck *HAVE* functions
<sonthonax>	Your argument rests on that pre es6 javascript didn’t have an explicit ‘class’ keyword.
<Sorella>	sonthonax: ES6 still doesn't have classes. In the same way Haskell doesn't have them, despite having a "class" syntax
<sonthonax>	And es6 are an incredibly tiny abstraction.
<sonthonax>	So what’s a class if it’s not a way of templating objects?
<Sorella>	ES6 "class" syntax are just a declarative syntax for constructor functions.
<jaawerth>	calling those classes was the one big mistep in ES6, IMO
<ethan_>	If ES6 "classes" aren't real, what features are missing from them?
<sonthonax>	Which template objects, which is what a class does.
<Sorella>	sonthonax: a class is a blueprint that defines how objects can be constructed, but they're NOT that object.
<Sorella>	sonthonax: contrast with prototypes, where you create a model object, then clone that object to create new ones.
<Hannibal_Smith>	sonthonax, just as a curiosity, from where you got these definitions? Your terminology seems really not standard
<Sorella>	It's VERY different. In code, in implementation and in semantics
<jaawerth>	in most ways that count, they're still just constructor functions, only with some surprising aspects to their behavior that make certain patterns no longer work
<Xatenev>	Sorella: ur speaking of prototype based now
<Golynx>	this is a class, var Class = { method: function() {...} }
<Xatenev>	but what if i define a normal "JS class"
<Xatenev>	using function whatever() { var test = function() { } }
<Sorella>	olli-: no
<sonthonax>	Hannibal_Smith: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_%28computer_programming%29
<jaawerth>	Xatenev: that still isn't a class, that's what she means
<Sorella>	Xatenev, Golynx: those are not classes, those are functions.
<quetzakubica>	Golynx: no
<jaawerth>	calling it a class in the first place is inaccurate
<Xatenev>	yea but its no function aswell
<Xatenev>	so what is it?
<jaawerth>	sure it is
<Sorella>	Xatenev: it's a function.
<Xatenev>	but it would be misleading to call it function anyways
<Xatenev>	cause if u say ur instantiating a function
<Xatenev>	that makes no sense
<Hannibal_Smith>	sonthonax, then I question myself where the person who created that page taken that definition
<Xatenev>	u get me
<quetzakubica>	in Golynx it was object
<Hannibal_Smith>	Sorella, do you have any idea?
<Golynx>	Sorella, quetzakubica it does what a class does
<jaawerth>	it's 100% a function. you can call it without "new", it just wont' work right
<sonthonax>	Sorella: implementation is really irrelevent. It’s the way you’re approaching the problem.
<quetzakubica>	Golynx: it doesn't
<Xatenev>	I defintely say its no real class
<Xatenev>	but i say its no function aswell :P
<jaawerth>	and even if you do, it's still a function
<Sorella>	sonthonax: read what I said again.
<Sorella>	Xatenev: it's a freaking JS function.
<jaawerth>	you can use "new" with any function, it's just that some functions require it to operate
<Sorella>	!new @ Xatenev
<ecmabot>	Xatenev: When you call a function with `new`, the `this` binding is set to a new object that has as its prototype ThatFunction.prototype, and if the function does not return an object, the result is that object. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new
<Xatenev>	Sorella: it makes no sense anyways
<Golynx>	quetzakubica: well in my world it is
<Sorella>	Ugh, not that. Why do people keep changing the factoids
<sonthonax>	Although C doesn’t have classes, I can create them.
<Xatenev>	Sorella: im just saying it makes no sense that its called a function xD
<sonthonax>	If I choose to structure, and *interpret* my code that way.
<Sorella>	Xatenev: the only thing that creates new instances in JS is "Object.create", and it does so by *CLONING* existing objects
<Xatenev>	Yap
<Xatenev>	absolutely
<Xatenev>	I just say its misleading that its called a function
<Xatenev>	if u use it as an object
<lalaland1125>	It seems to me that JS supports the key requirements of OOP classes. 1. Inheritance. 2. Combining functions and data. 3. Polymorphism.
<Xatenev>	no idea if u get me
<Sorella>	Xatenev: by the way, `var x = new Foo(a)` is implemented as `var x = Object.create(Foo.prototype); var r = Foo.call(x, a); if (isObject(r)) x = r;`
<Xatenev>	cause its used to fake a class
<sonthonax>	It’s about how you interpret the code.
<Sorella>	There's absolutely NO instantiating of ANY function there (although functions are objects, so you instantiate functions when you do `function(){ }`).
<lalaland1125>	Sorella, Implementation doesn't matter unless those implementation details affect the code.
<zomg>	lalaland1125: sure but don't you dare to suggest something is a class (not even when using ES6 class syntax) because you'll get the pedantry hate train upon you
<Sorella>	lalaland1125: that's the semantics, not implementation
<Sorella>	(As in, THE SPECIFICATION semantics)
<Xatenev>	Sorella: its still a lot of faking
<Xatenev>	no?
<lalaland1125>	Sorella, Class is a semantic term, not an implementation term.
<Sorella>	lalaland1125: ...
<Xatenev>	Its clear if u know whats going on in the background
<Xatenev>	But if u just look at what your writing actually
<Xatenev>	it makes no sense
<sonthonax>	Just because it doesn’t have an explicit ‘class’ keyword, doesn’t mean classes don’t exist.
<Xatenev>	:p
*	Sorella gives up, goes to do something useful
<Xatenev>	Or am I wrong?
<Sorella>	You can read Reginald's article again, and the Self papers, if you want to understand the subject.
<zomg>	sonthonax: don't bother. You're wrong because javascript doesn't have classes, therefore you're wrong ;)
<Golynx>	well its the creators of javascripts fault, for not being like all the other programming languages
<sonthonax>	zomg: you can do classes in any language.
<prohobo>	actionscript has classes...
<quetzakubica>	Crockford once said that the best thing about js is classless.
<prohobo>	actionscript is essentially javascript
<zomg>	sonthonax: sure but no point in attempting to convince anyone of it here because trust me I've tried, lol
<livcd>	my school has classes
<d10n-work>	Is there a way to whitelist package files fetched by npm, similar to how bower-installer whitelists files fetched by bower?
<Xatenev>	Sorella: can we say function Apple(whatever) { whatever } }; is a blueprint?
<lalaland1125>	Ok, I think I understand the point of disagreement. The "anti-class" people believe that classes describe a language feature. The "pro-class" people believe that classes just describe a way of coding (such that their code has certain characteristics).
<Sorella>	Xatenev: no.
<zomg>	lalaland1125: you pretty much nailed it
<lalaland1125>	We can all agree to disagree.
<Sorella>	Xatenev: that's a function
<sonthonax>	lalaland1125: +1
<Xatenev>	Sorella: hm
<jaawerth>	my main problem with ES6 classes is that they in some ways are the same familiar constructor pattern, but along with the new convenience capabilities they've gone and broken some of the features/capabilities of the pure constructor approach in ways that you can still do it, just with bizarre results
<Sorella>	lalaland1125: it's very well defined in academic literature. Using terminology wrong is one of the major sources of confusion in CS. (see FRP)
<sonthonax>	Classes are a software pattern. I think it’s a bit mean to chastise a javascript noob for wanting to implement a common pattern.
<jaawerth>	for example, you can still add a method to a prototype outside of the class declaration, it's just going to screw it up unless you then take additional steps, and at that point you might as well have not used the class declaration in the first place
<sonthonax>	Sorella: that’s this first I’ve ever head, ‘classes are very well defined’
<Sorella>	sonthonax: they're not a pattern. And as I said, you *CAN* implement classes in JS, the same way you can implement classes in C, etc.
<Golynx>	its a scripting language afterall. Insane!
<Sorella>	sonthonax: I gave the definition at least three times before, and linked to an article that also gives that definition.
<Sorella>	(I could also link to the Self papers. The "Self: The Power Of Simplicity" paper describes very well their differences)
<zomg>	the problem is attempting to make academia work for practical coding
<lalaland1125>	Is there any sane way to use promises to reflect a stream of values? Or am I going to have to pull in a stream library?
<zomg>	it makes sense to differnetiate things in strict level in academia
<Xatenev>	Anyways, u can still call constructor functions classes imho
<Xatenev>	:p
<zomg>	but you don't get anything from not calling something that looks like a class a class in practical day to day work :P
*	NoiseEee_ is now known as NoiseEee
<Golynx>	OOP should be simple and easy in any programming language these days. Why js makes that so hard , God only knows
<Sorella>	zomg: "enlightenment" :P
<Xatenev>	Except if ur trying to call everything overly correct
<Sorella>	Golynx: how is OOP hard in JS?
<zomg>	Sorella: more like the feeling of self importance
<zomg>	lol
<Xatenev>	zomg: +1
<lalaland1125>	Sorella, The "this" keyword is really poorly done.
<jaawerth>	Sorella: not to be contrary, but javascript classes are still classes under the wikipedia definition you linked
<pandeiro>	Sorella: yeah that is the one (medium-editor.js) - I just realized it supports image drag/drop... good enough for now
<lalaland1125>	I am glad they finally "fixed" it for array functions.
<Golynx>	Sorella: call it what it is OBJECT should be CLASS , functions inside OBJECTS should be Methods
<zomg>	`this` works a bit better with ES6 arrows
<zomg>	but yeah it's a tad clunky otherwise
<Docmarten>	nbt (or whomever) : I am trying to do something that is clearly beyond me.  The idea is to consolidate 5 different yet very similar functions into one.  I don't know if what I am trying to do can be done but I think it can, and I honestly have no idea how to accomplish it let alone know what to search for on google for additional help/reading.  But hopefully you get the idea of from this
<Docmarten>	sample: http://pastebin.com/zvstQMeB
<Sorella>	>> function extend(a,b){ for (var k in b) a[k] = b[k] }; var Clonable = { clone: function(v){ return extend(Object.create(this), v || {}) }}; var Voiced = Clonable.clone({ say: function(m){ return this.name + ' says "' + m + '"' }}); var Alice = Voiced.clone({ name: 'Alice' }); Alice.say('Hello, from OOP land')
<ecmabot>	Sorella: TypeError: Voiced is undefined
<zomg>	tbh I just avoid using it altogether because of it
<jaawerth>	also, isn't "class" always the definition and not the object itself?
<Golynx>	constructors , interfaces, factory classes, the good stuff, that all other languages do so easily. But js no
<Sorella>	>> function extend(a,b){ for (var k in b) a[k] = b[k]; return a }; var Clonable = { clone: function(v){ return extend(Object.create(this), v || {}) }}; var Voiced = Clonable.clone({ say: function(m){ return this.name + ' says "' + m + '"' }}); var Alice = Voiced.clone({ name: 'Alice' }); Alice.say('Hello, from OOP land')
<ecmabot>	Sorella: (string) 'Alice says "Hello, from OOP land"'
<Sorella>	Golynx: none of those have absolutely any relationship with OOP
<Sorella>	jaawerth: yes
<cipoll>	hi guys
<cipoll>	what's the best book on javascript?
<lalaland1125>	Docmarten, Why don't you just use json? Why the special format?
<sonthonax>	Sorella: the term class varies from programming language. But why is a prototype antithetical to the idea of a class? It’s still a ‘blueprint that defined how an object can be constructed’ if you choose to use it that way.
<jaawerth>	Golynx: well, that's the argument in favor of not using other terminology. It really isn't all that hard in OO to do javascript, it becomes hard when you try look at the terminology, see the familiar terms, and attempt to take a classical approach to ti
<cipoll>	javascript the language, not the frameworks
<Sorella>	jaawerth: I didn't link to Wikipedia, btw
<jaawerth>	oh
<jaawerth>	who was that...
<sonthonax>	jaawerth: that was me
<Sorella>	sonthonax: *sigh*, again, read Reginald's article and the Self paper I mentioned.
<jaawerth>	ahh
<jaawerth>	hehe
<jaawerth>	too many links flying around + poor IRC comprehension on my part
<sonthonax>	Sorella: yes, I read it.
<lalaland1125>	Docmarten, Also, it would be helpful if you provided an example of one of the similar functions, so we can see what you are trying to consolidate.
<Sorella>	jaawerth: I've linked to this: http://raganwald.com/2015/05/11/javascript-classes.html
<Docmarten>	lalaland : ok, let me append..one moment.
<sonthonax>	Sorella: you seem to be saying that because prototypes aren’t classes, that doing things like classes isn’t utterly trivial.
<Sorella>	sonthonax: I'm saying that prototypes aren't classes. I'm not sure what you're getting at with the second part.
<Sorella>	sonthonax: prototypes aren't classes in the same way that a drawing of a house isn't an actual house.
<Sorella>	sonthonax: in a prototypical language, you can USE the objects without "constructing instances of them", just as you would use any other object. Prototypes have you creating model objects, then cloning those objects and modifying them. I've explained this at least two times
<jaawerth>	Sorella: ah yeah, I think I've read that before. Good article, but I'm not necessary sure I buy the distinction - everything laid out is true, I just don't think it points to the conclusion as decisively as the article suggests
<jaawerth>	necessarily*
<sonthonax>	Sorella: someone asked how to do classes in javascript, and you said that javascript doesn’t have classes. Yes it doesn’t have classes in the language definition. But it’s trivial to implement a pattern which behaves like a class with prototypes. It’s confusing and pedentic to people who are new to javascript.
<Sorella>	sonthonax: it's not trivial to implement classes in JS.
<natmyers>	I just feel sorry for the poor guy that asked the question
<jaawerth>	Specifically, it's saying the JavaScript class isn't a firstclass entity in the same way that Ruby or Smalltalk classes are first-class entity, that it's just an abstraction. But that abstraction is a constructor function with a prototype. And functions are first-class entities
<Sorella>	sonthonax: because the underlying OO model is completely different. It's better for the person to understand how the underlying OO model works instead
<Sorella>	(And I've linked an article that would explain them that)
<jaawerth>	the main downside is that calling them classes tricks people into not understanding the prototypical behavior and treating it like a more traditional class
<sonthonax>	That doesn’t tell him anything about the problems he may face attempting to implement a class like pattern in javascript.
<jaawerth>	but I don't see that as the same thing as it NOT being a class
<Sorella>	sonthonax: you can't expect to ask "How do you do OOP in Haskell" and not be told "Actually, we don't do that, we use this instead (link to an article explaining how to think about Haskell programs and write them)"
<Sorella>	Which was exactly what I did
<lalaland1125>	sonthonax, Classes's aren't completely trivial in JS. I think everyone messes up with the this keyword at least once.
<jaawerth>	yeah, the way it's scoped is just weird
<zomg>	the rules for how `this` works are fairly simple though, but usually when learning nobody tells you them up front so it looks really confusing
<Kattkunskap>	on the other hand, the way "this" works makes the language very powerful
<Sorella>	`this` is fairly simple.
<jaawerth>	but yeah, once you get it, you get it
<Sorella>	I particularly dislike the way it works, and would have done the same as Lua instead.
<Sorella>	(Or if it was more to the OO side, the same as I did in Mermaid, and have `this` always bound)
<jaawerth>	it just gets hairy when you're declaring a function inside a function, and the outer function may or may not have a defined "this"
<sonthonax>	lalaland1125: classes may not be trivial, but to most people they mean, procedure to create an object based on a set of varibles.
<Sorella>	jaawerth: fixed now with arrow functions
<jaawerth>	yep
<jaawerth>	arrow functions make make that chain much, much easier to follow
<Sorella>	sonthonax: yes, and the way you'd do that in JS is different from the way you'd do that in Java.
<jaawerth>	binding helps too, people don't do that enough
<prohobo>	check out this monster of regex: ^([\w\s]{0}(?![-\w]+(>>((,\s)?"?\$[\w]+\$"?)+)?($|\n))).+($|\n)
<prohobo>	eh?
<prohobo>	yeee
<jaawerth>	though binding also gets weird
<sonthonax>	Sorella: practically, yes. But conceptually, no.
<jaawerth>	on account of how it's overridden once that function goes on an object
<Sorella>	jaawerth: in Mermaid, functions get bound when you access them. And lambdas are always bound. So you don't get the problems people have in JS
<Docmarten>	lalaland1125 : here it is, http://pastebin.com/mxN4qD9Z
<Sharaal>	prohobo: I would fire the creator of this unreadable bunch
<Sorella>	sonthonax: both practically and conceptually.
<prohobo>	Sharaal: how are you supposed to make regex readable?
<jaawerth>	Sorella: nice
<Sorella>	sonthonax: it's so different that the people working on Self had to write an article on it: http://bibliography.selflanguage.org/organizing-programs.html
<sonthonax>	Sorella: the basic concept of a prodedure to create a datastructure is the same.
<jaawerth>	Sorella: deltas also help the binding issue since it's so trivial to simply wrap a bound function in another one with minimal syntax
<jaawerth>	Sorella: er, lambdas
<Sharaal>	prohobo: using named variables for the different sections of the regex or add document to that sections helps to understand every single section and at the end the complete regex
<Sorella>	sonthonax: that's not a class though. Calling that a class would be the same as calling the `newWithArgs(...)` method in an arbitrary programming language "a class"
<Sorella>	But yes, constructors tend to be the same across languages
<sonthonax>	Sorella: but that’s what essentially happens.
<jaawerth>	classes are also immutable in many classical languages
<jaawerth>	and that is in no way true in JS
<Sorella>	jaawerth: only bad ones
<jaawerth>	haha
<jaawerth>	won't argue with that
<Sorella>	Smalltalk, Ruby, Python, etc. all allow you to mutate the class
<Xatenev>	0
<Sorella>	(And manipulate it arbitrarily)
<jaawerth>	yeah, those languages are better at it
<sonthonax>	Smalltalk seem to allow to change anything at runtime.
<Sorella>	sonthonax: yes, that's what the `newWithArgs(...)` method does. That's a constructor, not a class.
<Sorella>	sonthonax: yup, it's one of its premises. Though Self takes that further.
<Docmarten>	Is there an IRC option that can beep when your Nick is mentioned?
<prohobo>	depends on your client
<Xatenev>	Docmarten: depends on ur client :]
<Xatenev>	prohobo: lold at that
<lalaland1125>	Docmarten, Yeah, you can simply this.  Here is my attempt: http://pastebin.com/cXz9xsPa
<prohobo>	i always go for the easy victories
<Docmarten>	Xatenev : mIRC
<Xatenev>	Docmarten: alt b
<cipoll>	what's the best book on javascript?
<Xatenev>	highlight section inside that
<Pessimist>	!book
<ecmabot>	Pessimist: !eloquent (eloquentjavascript.net), JavaScript: The Definitive Guide by David Flanagan, High Performance JavaScript by Nicholas C. Zakas, Effective JavaScript by David Herman, Functional JavaScript by Michael Fogus, Programming JavaScript Applications (ericelliottjs.com/product/programming-javascript-applications-paper-ebook-bundle/)
<Pessimist>	cipoll: ^ these are some recommendations
<cipoll>	but what is the bible
<sonthonax>	Sorella: newWithArgs(…), if it was doing something class like, would return a reference to the object with it’s functions bound it it.
<Pessimist>	the ecmascript standard, cipoll
<cipoll>	is it in form of "standard"?
<cipoll>	standard are not meaningful...
<Pessimist>	cipoll: http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/
<Docmarten>	oh shit...a B2 Stealth bomber just took off over my house.  That was frickin' badass!!!!
<Sorella>	sonthonax: you're confounding constructor functions/methods with classes. Reading on the difference between the two should help
<cipoll>	but that's a specification...
<Pessimist>	cipoll: how they are not? they describe everything about the language
<Pessimist>	cipoll: you asked for a bible ;)
<cipoll>	bible's are something different
<cjohnson>	standards are the only things that are meaningful cipoll
<cjohnson>	I would say Eloquent is what you're looking for though
<cjohnson>	or javascript the good parts but it's out of date
<sonthonax>	Sorella: yes it’s just a function. But a class is just a low level pattern.
<cipoll>	i mean a book,  equivalent to "The Javascript Programming Language"
<cipoll>	something like that
<cjohnson>	a book that describe the language in its entirety?
<cipoll>	yes
<cjohnson>	spec is the only thing
<Pessimist>	*cough* standard *cough*
*	Sorella wonders why she still tries
<Pessimist>	bbl
<Siecje>	I'm trying to use setInterval but each function is only being called once https://dpaste.de/8OaK
<cjohnson>	if you want it in its entirety, you want the spec cipoll. If you don't want to read the spec, you don't want it in its entirety
<cipoll>	a book which can be used for learning purposes
<cjohnson>	in which case Eloquent is a good book to start with
<cjohnson>	but doesn't cover javascript in its entirety
<cipoll>	standards are not for learning purposes
<sonthonax>	Sorella: what if implement a class pattern in C? am I not using classes because C doesn’t have classes in the language.
<cipoll>	not mainly
<cjohnson>	that's not what you asked for, and sure they are
<Xatenev>	Sorella: sonthonax u both keep repeating yourself :P
<cjohnson>	you ask for something that describes the entire language. and I'm telling you, the answer is simple. The only thing that does is the spec
<cjohnson>	if you don't actually want something to describe the entire language, read eloquent
<Xatenev>	and bringing the same arguments over and over again :P you should maybe just stop cause this discussion wont get anywhere :P
<cjohnson>	either way you have your answer
<Sorella>	sonthonax: now you're confounding "built-in support," "implementation of a particular feature" and "encoding of a particular feature"
<cipoll>	but i don't want to "start with", i want complete book, even if advanced
<cjohnson>	either way you have your answer
<cjohnson>	stop asking it
<Sorella>	!g william cook proposal modern definition OOP @ sonthonax
<ecmabot>	sonthonax: William Cook's Fusings: A Proposal for Simplified, Modern ... <http://wcook.blogspot.com/2012/07/proposal-for-simplified-modern.html>
<Sorella>	(Read that)
<tarkus>	I'm wondering, what's the best approach for creating data endpoints for an SPA app, maybe something similar to restify or JSON API or Relay?
<cjohnson>	no best way
<fsda>	anekos: hi!
<cjohnson>	depends on what you're familiar with, and what you need to do tarkus
<sonthonax>	Code is completely meaningless until we perscribe it meaning. https://gist.github.com/anonymous/64fe7993ec379ede84a3
<cjohnson>	an HTTP JSON service seems reasonable
<tarkus>	cjohnson, for example, i need 1 ajax request per page load (as opposed to multiple ajax calls per data entity)
<fsda>	(sorry how to reply - what syntax to use? es: #username? )
<Sorella>	sonthonax: you're the only person talking about code here
<sonthonax>	Those two snippets have the same properties, but only one’s a class.
<fsda>	@anekos
<fsda>	#anekos
<natmyers>	cipoll: I would assume the o'reilly book is probably what you're looking for
<d10n-work>	fsda: just type their name
<Docmarten>	Hoping another one takes off, want to get video of it.  I am about a 1/2 mile north of the runway and I am right in the flight patten.  First time I ever saw a B2 Bomber take off before.
<fsda>	anekos hi anekos "
<fsda>	(thanks d10n-work
<lalaland1125>	tarkus, Could you clarify your question?
<sonthonax>	Docmarten: it will be back in 18 hours after return from syria.
<lalaland1125>	What exactly are you looking for?
<serses>	how do i copy an obj without losing the copy prop if i modifiy the main object?
<cjohnson>	tarkus: er, ok
<cjohnson>	then program it to do so :P
<Docmarten>	lalaland1125 - I will give that a shot.  thx.  def a more simple approach than I was trying.
<Docmarten>	or thinking had to be done.
<cjohnson>	tarkus: that sounds silly though. The whole point of ajax is that you don't know all of the things you need as the page loads
<Sorella>	serses: depends on a lot of things.
<cjohnson>	tarkus: if you can bundle all your data together such that you can gather *all* of it in a single request, the data should just come with the initial pagel oad
<cjohnson>	and you shouldn't use ajax at all
<serses>	i only keep attributes in the object
<serses>	no functions
<Sorella>	serses: if you just want a shallow copy, you can either use Object.create or copy all the properties to a new object. If you want a deep copy, things are much harder
<cjohnson>	Object.assign ?
<cjohnson>	why Object.create
<natmyers>	cipoll: probably this guy http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920029564.do
<cjohnson>	he wants the book to cover the entirety of the language natmyers :P
<Sorella>	cjohnson: Object.create "clones" an existing object, in the prototypical sense
<i5um41ru>	hi guys, could i do an ajax upload without using formData?
<lalaland1125>	cjohnson, tarkus GraphQL is an attempt to do everything in one request. Not released yet though.
<natmyers>	ha well there's always the RFCs
<cjohnson>	oh I see what you mean Sorella, make a new object that inherits from the original
<sonthonax>	lalaland1125: I don’t even understand what they intend to realease.
<cjohnson>	instead of actually cloning it, or just making an ew pointer to the same obj
<cjohnson>	lalaland1125: that sounds like nonsense
<sonthonax>	A query language for what database?
<cjohnson>	natmyers: he doesn't want it to be the standard. but he does want 100% of the language. But just not the standard. But it should be 100%...
<cjohnson>	:P
<zpartw>	With the skills I see people in here have, why aren't you creating the next Minecraft? You seem to have extraordinary knowledge of both JS and math and general programming. I tried to ask questions yesterday and didn't understand shit of what you replied.
<cjohnson>	minecraft isn't a question of programming skill
<lalaland1125>	cjohnson, Well, do the initial page load in one request. (Of course addition requests are necessary for dynamic functionality)
<cjohnson>	it was artistic vision combined with a lot of luck
<lalaland1125>	And good gameplay.
<sonthonax>	zpartw: my basement isn’t nearly large enough to make minecraft.
<zpartw>	cjohnson: It contains insane amounts of advanced math, so, um, yes... I do believe it hugely matters.
<zpartw>	sonthonax: That doesn't make sense.
<Sorella>	sonthonax: query languages don't need to be for databases. See Facebook's existing "Haxl" language
<andygmb>	would this be a good way to pass javascript variables from a templating system? http://dpaste.com/3H2CPDF
<andygmb>	I don't know if there's a standard way to do it in js
<cjohnson>	maybe it does now, to improve performance. but it's not really insane or advanced. it's just standard math concepts for 3d gaming engines
<sonthonax>	Sorella: so will they just be releasing a definition.
<cjohnson>	when it exploded in popularity it was rather simple
<cjohnson>	he came up with all the advanced rendering stuff after the fact
<Sorella>	sonthonax: I'm not familiar with GraphQL, I'm just saying that "querying a database" is not the only thing you'd use a query language for.
<cjohnson>	either way, your point was about minecraft being a major money maker right?
<cjohnson>	in which case no, the advanced-ness of the underlying code had nothing to do with that
<Sorella>	YQL is a good example of that.
<Sorella>	Haxl is another
<cjohnson>	its popularity and success is a function of the game idea, and an incredible amount of luck
<zpartw>	"standard math concepts for 3d gaming engines"
<sonthonax>	zpartw: actually the maths needed to make a basic minecraft clone is first year university level. The rest is application.
<cjohnson>	yes
<Sorella>	zpartw: Minecraft is boring.
<cjohnson>	it really is not difficult, if you're already familiar with making 3d games
<zpartw>	Do you realize how few humans are able to code even the simplest 3D engine?
<sonthonax>	Which admitedly there’s a huge learning curve.
<cjohnson>	quite a few actually. but either way you're skipping past my point for a second time now
<sonthonax>	zpartw: do you realise how few people are even capable of basic calculus.
<Sorella>	zpartw: why would you even WANT to do that? There are several 3D engines for you to choose from, that people have spent countless hours optimising and stuff
<sonthonax>	(proportionally)
<zpartw>	Of course you can't make another Minecraft right now and have it become anything but a clone. But I meant that at least I am full of ideas all the time that I simply cannot realize due to lack of skills.
<Sorella>	Unreal Engine is even free now
<cjohnson>	I'm not that interested in learning 3d gaming. I'm sure if I devoted the next few years to it I'd become fairly proficient in it, but it's just not interesting enough to me. And given that the reason for minecraft's success is **luck** and **game design** and not programming ability, there would n't even be any guaranteed return on it
<zpartw>	Sure, but...
<sonthonax>	Sorella: because zpartw will probably hit a stumbling block as soon as wanted to change the 3d perspective and saw a 4x4 matrix.
<cjohnson>	and exactly, most of the real work is already done for you
<zpartw>	Also, those "free" engines such as Unreal Engine aren't really free at all, and AFAIK don't even work with JS.
<Sharaal>	I don't know what kind of programing skill minecraft would need, technically nothing is new in this game
<Sorella>	zpartw: Unity uses JS. But why would anyone want to use JS for scripting a game?
<sonthonax>	Sorella: WebGL.
*	Guest21092 is now known as grubles
<zpartw>	Um... because that's the language you've taken the time to understand somewhat?
<Pessimist>	zpartw: sell your ideas, then :)
<Sharaal>	browser/mobile games makes sense in js
<zpartw>	Pessimist: They aren't worth anything as ideas.
<Sorella>	sonthonax: that's irrelevant to "wanting to use JS for scripting a game"
<sonthonax>	sorry?
<cjohnson>	zpartw: where does JS come into play here?
<lalaland1125>	zpartw, Sounds like you might be interested in watching other people program games. You might want to look at the Handmade hero videos. https://www.youtube.com/user/handmadeheroarchive
<Sharaal>	and servers makes sense to build them in js
<zpartw>	I don't know, nor want to use, C++. I wanna use JS.
<sonthonax>	WebGL is generally interfaced with javascript.
<cjohnson>	zpartw: you use the right tool for the job
<Sorella>	zpartw: there are plenty of languages besides C++ and JS
<zpartw>	Ugh...
<cjohnson>	JS is not well-tooled for building advanced 3d games
<Sorella>	sonthonax: sure, but you don't need JS to use WebGL.
<zpartw>	"Never ask for advice" <- I never follow my own motto.
<cjohnson>	you asked for a discussion and you don't like the response
<cjohnson>	who's fault is that
<sonthonax>	Sorella: sure, but if you want to deploy your WebGL game anywhere you better use JS.
<cjohnson>	what you're asking about is mostly unreasonable
<Sorella>	sonthonax: no.
*	cjohnson popcorn
<Sharaal>	zpartw: I recommend to ignore some ppl in chats like IRC to get usefull answers :)
<Sorella>	sonthonax: the programming language you use to write your game is *irrelevant*
<ankr>	zpartw if you just want to play around making some 3d game prototypes I guess js is fine (you'd probably want to use three.js or similar).. If you want to do something more serious you might want to choose another tool.
<Sorella>	sonthonax: I could use, e.g.: Dart, and it would still be playable in a browser.
<sonthonax>	Sorella: yeah fine you can transpile or whatever.
<Sorella>	Compile. You always have to compile everything in any case.
<sonthonax>	But hold on as I write a x86 to javascript transpiler, for my minecraft clone...
<Sorella>	sonthonax: the point is that there are languages that are better suited for writing games. And there are languages where tooling is much better for writing games. Specially 3D ones.
<cjohnson>	zpartw: you can use a hammer to drive a screw in, but it's gonna be a lot harder. JS is the hammer, complicated 3d games are the screw
<Sorella>	And Unreal Engine runs on the browser now
<Sorella>	(Compiled with Emscripten, I suppose)
<Sorella>	Plus it runs in several other platforms
<sonthonax>	Yes, if I wanted to write a webGL game, the language I’d use would either be javascript, or influanced heavily by it. I would not do what the Unreal Engine guy did, because that’s a monster job.
<cjohnson>	you don't see any major game studios writing games solely in JS. you would most certainly have to learn some C++ or some other low-level game
<Sharaal>	*throws unity into the room*
<sonthonax>	Unreal Engine people*
<Sorella>	Unity still requires a plugin, no?
<sonthonax>	Sorella: not anymore.
<Sharaal>	cjohnson: depends on what games, I know game studios writing games with js
<cjohnson>	major game studios, writing solely in JS
<Sharaal>	the major ones are not the modern ones
<Sorella>	So there's Unity as well. I don't see why people would want to write their own game engines, unless they're building something fairly simple.
<cjohnson>	depends what you mean by modern
<cjohnson>	I find programmers define modern in a different way than applies to reality
<livcd>	is shadow and virtual dom the same ? oO
<cjohnson>	"more fun tooling" I find that means
<Sorella>	livcd: no
<sonthonax>	Sorella: learning exersise.
<livcd>	Sorella: ok thanks
<Sorella>	sonthonax: not something you want to do when you're building a product
<Sorella>	If you're doing it yourself, sure. Go wild. Do whatever you want.
<Boogymanx>	Hey guys, anyone got localStorage experience?
<Sorella>	doing it for yourself*
<stalkr_>	Hi, I'm using _.template for my templating, I'm having trouble with some HTML escaping (I think). This is what I see Downolad file &quot;Appointments & Exams&quot; but I don't want the &quot; to be escaped, how can I see real quotes?
<stalkr_>	I have tried <%- and <%=
<gildarts>	Sorella, I would guess that the best reason for writing your own engine is if you need more performance than you can get from something like unity and you can get it by making a smaller subset of functionality.
<ankr>	Boogymanx I suppose  you have a question? just ask
<gildarts>	But I don't really know having never looked into it.
<Sharaal>	cjohnson: startups are most times more modern as major companies, cause the major ones want to use the skillset and tools they have since years
<sonthonax>	Sorella: so there’s a reason to use javascript with webgl.
<cjohnson>	Sharaal: that's exactly what I'm talking about
<cjohnson>	I find the startups aren't actually any more modern in their output. They just have tooling that is more enjoyable to use for the dev
<Boogymanx>	I'm using D3JS and want to store coordinates in local storage after dragging
<Sorella>	gildarts: only if you're targeting a REALLY specific platform. Otherwise you'll spend much more time doing optimisations that work cross platform
<Sorella>	sonthonax: *shrugs*
<cjohnson>	either way, semantics. you're missing my point
<Boogymanx>	I'm doing this with the following in my dragend function:         localStorage.setItem(d.name + 'x', d.x)
<gildarts>	Sorella, ah, true. Didn't think of that aspect of it.

<Boogymanx>	Or I can't read it out, it's one or the other
<Boogymanx>	I'm setting the X and Y coordinates like this: if (localStorage && localStorage.getitem(d.name + 'x')) { return localStorage.getItem(d.name+'x') }
<cjohnson>	Boogymanx: paste code, we can't read your mind
<Boogymanx>	well it's a lot of code
<Boogymanx>	but I'll just take the relevant parts
<cjohnson>	only paste the relevant bit
<cjohnson>	yeah
<Sorella>	cjohnson: modern = popular :P

<Sharaal>	blizzard is popular, but not modern ^^
<Boogymanx>	cjohnson: https://dpaste.de/VGGk
<Sorella>	I was hinting about how Node is popular, and used a lot in startups, but it's a far cry from being modern
<gildarts>	Oh, out of curiosity. What do you think of Go, Sorella?
<Sorella>	gildarts: it's awful :D
<Sorella>	!g why is go not good
<ecmabot>	Sorella: Why Go Is Not Good :: Will Yager - yager.io <http://yager.io/programming/go.html>
<Sorella>	gildarts:  ^ the same thing he does
<lalaland1125>	Go really should have had generics.
<Sharaal>	Sorella: I think the most things most companies use are not modern in your mind ;)
<Sorella>	Sharaal: that's true
<gildarts>	I will take a look thanks! I have been poking at it some, but have mixed feelings.
<ipwa>	I’m setting a cookie expiery date like this: getDate() + 5 * 365
<Sorella>	Though companies using Clojure and Datomic are definitely on my good side :P
<Boogymanx>	I can tell that it's being saved because I added a console.log(localStorage.getItem(d.name + 'x'))
<Sharaal>	Sorella: but using things no one have knowledge about it is not always the truth
<ipwa>	how much is that setting the expiry date to?
<Sorella>	Sharaal: yeah. Using things that are not popular is difficult
<lalaland1125>	At least the popular languages tend to bring in modern features.
<lalaland1125>	So not all is lost.
<lalaland1125>	(Eventually)
<Sorella>	ES will eventually be usable, in 5~6 years :P
<cjohnson>	Boogymanx: my guess is your code isn't running in the right order
<cjohnson>	http://jsfiddle.net/pj1mbgcv/
<cjohnson>	set/get seems to work fine here
*	Torkable is now known as Guest63077
<Boogymanx>	cjohnson: calling the localstorage is defined after the dragend
*	_creativename is now known as _DB
<cjohnson>	Boogymanx: well, look at the fiddle I posted. Obviously if the code fires in the correct order, they work. So that leaves only 2 possibilities: your code is not firing in the order you think it is (likely due to async), or the variable that you're writing isn't the same as the variable you're reading
<cjohnson>	console.log d.name + 'x' right before you read it
<cjohnson>	and write it
<cjohnson>	if they both match up, then it's an ordering issue
<gildarts>	Sorella, thanks for the article. The first three issues listed (generics, extensibility, failure conditions) were/are my biggest concerns/issues that I have run into while trying it.
<jaawerth>	granted, javascript has many similar failings (not that anyone ever said javascript wasn't rife with issues and limitations)
<jaawerth>	I DO like goroutines though
<cjohnson>	javascript is perfect
<cjohnson>	utterly flawless
<cjohnson>	there, I said it
<jaawerth>	haha
<lalaland1125>	jaawerth, Look at async and await.
<lalaland1125>	They are practically goroutines.
<gildarts>	The XML parsing built into the standard library is really nice as well. The lack of generics and extensibility was what really bugged me.
<jaawerth>	lalaland1125: kinda
<saberu>	looking for partner for JS gambling game
<gildarts>	I mean you let me make a custom data type and then don't let me overload the `+` operator??
<cjohnson>	I am willing to be a silent partner
<cjohnson>	that does no work
<cjohnson>	but takes half the money
<saberu>	done
<jaawerth>	lalaland1125: there are some other neat aspects to goroutines beyond just writing async stuff in a synchronous way though
<cjohnson>	you aren't making a custom data type, just an object that inherits from another objects gildarts
<cjohnson>	it's still the same Object data type
<gildarts>	Eh, true. But you know what I mean.
<Boogymanx>	cjohnson: I'm still not seeing what I'm doing wrong, but I'll have a look in #d3.js to see if anyone has any experience
<Boogymanx>	Thanks for the help
<Boogymanx>	The console.log shows the same x coordinates four times, which is odd
<Sorella>	gildarts: take a look at Dart instead. Operators in Dart are just regular object methods :P
<cjohnson>	Boogymanx: you're prob calling your functions erroneously then, and overwriting your value by calling the write function more than you expect
<cjohnson>	gildarts: well, I know what you mean, but that's exactly why your argument isn't consistent
<cjohnson>	if they had provided custom data types but no overloaded operators that would be silly yeah
<alpha59>	random question. anyone have a good resource for web-audio recording (Audio-context) and then uploading to a server via Ajax.
<cjohnson>	but they provide neither
<jaawerth>	I probably just have goroutines on the mind because I just finished exploring using them + csp channels in js
<cjohnson>	how do you want to record it alpha59? microphone access?
<saberu>	is it better to reverse engineer existing game or do a new?
<Sorella>	jaawerth: A good alternative is probably Rust. And it has CSP as well
<cjohnson>	saberu: better for what? for who?
<jaawerth>	Sorella: Rust is legit, yeah
<alpha59>	cjohnson: yeah, which I've already got via a library called record.js
<cjohnson>	I hate Rust. they're recalling the frame on my truck for it
<cjohnson>	gonna be a pain
<cjohnson>	instantrimshot.com
<jaawerth>	Sorella: doesn't mean I don't want to use CSP in js though ;-)
<jaawerth>	I THINK I like it better than Rx, but I need to try implementing some stuff using CSP that I've written using Rx
<cjohnson>	alpha59: so what bit do you need to figure out? you have captured it already
<alpha59>	*recorder.js
<gildarts>	cjohnson, well they let you make named structs which have can have functions attached to them like methods. So not sure why operator overloading is that different?
<jaawerth>	(as a JS solution, I mean)
<Sorella>	jaawerth: oh, sure, I meant wrt Go
<cjohnson>	gildarts: the data type is still Object
<jaawerth>	Oh. yeah
<cjohnson>	you aren't coming up with a new data type
<jaawerth>	Rust also just feels more familiar to me
<alpha59>	I can't figure out how to take that captured file and put it into a file that can be uploaded
<cjohnson>	This is the classic confusion in JS -- prototypal inheritance is not classical OOP
<jaawerth>	from other languages
<cjohnson>	alpha59: what does your recorder.js give you, a blob?
<gildarts>	Sorella, I will probably just brush off my python rather than using dart.
<gildarts>	cjohnson, sorry. I was still talking about go >.>
<Sorella>	gildarts: Dart is a superior language to Python imho
<alpha59>	media stream source?
<Sorella>	Has a better standard library too
<cjohnson>	gildarts: oh, I dunno that
<cjohnson>	alpha59: link to docs?
<cjohnson>	alpha59: is this what you got? https://github.com/mattdiamond/Recorderjs
<saberu>	cjohnson: saberu: better for what? for who? for the person who makes the game
<bradleymeck>	dart is strange
<saberu>	better as in easier
<jaawerth>	python's got a better eco system, though, surely
*	zz_robotmayo is now known as robotmayo
<Sorella>	bradleymeck: how so?
<alpha59>	https://github.com/mattdiamond/Recorderjs
<alpha59>	yeah
<cjohnson>	saberu: better as in easier? or better as in teaches you more
<cjohnson>	alpha59: rec.exportWAV([callback][, type])
<Sorella>	jaawerth: oh, definitely.
<saberu>	easier
<yottabyte>	hi y'all, I'm looking at some code that sort of confused me. Is it regular to have expressions like var b = someObject ? something : something else;? I guess it checks if someObject exists (non null?) and evals that to true and false?
<cjohnson>	This will generate a Blob object containing the recording in WAV format. The callback will be called with the Blob as its sole argument. If a callback is not specified, the default callback (as defined in the config) will be used. If no default has been set, an error will be thrown.
<bradleymeck>	Sorella: just a lot of syntax choices make things strange, like keyword arguments being global to your parameter list
<Sorella>	In any case, Mermaid still kicks both language's asses :P
<cjohnson>	saberu: probably easier to start from scratch than try to reverse engineer something. but you can use an existing game as a basis for how to approach your own
<saberu>	obviously doing it from scratch teaches you more but you  can still look at other peoples code to learn
<cjohnson>	alpha59: so exportWAV will give you a blob, which you can just send via standard XHR
<saberu>	yeh perhaps , but at the very least i can rip their sprites and maybe some functions
<saberu>	problem is their code is 50,000 lines for the game engine
<saberu>	it's HUGE
<Sorella>	bradleymeck: oh, yeah. I don't agree with their choice of making it look mainstream-y. If they made it look more like Smalltalk, it would be a really great language (though probably be even less popular)
<cjohnson>	yeah, you're not going to duplicate their work overnight saberu
<cjohnson>	what do you expect?
<cjohnson>	that's why it's prob better to start from scratch. that way you can start small
<cjohnson>	and build on it over time
<bradleymeck>	Sorella: the language semantics are fine, the optional typing is a bit awkward since it is basically doing type erasure which I hate
<alpha59>	ok thanks, I was misunderstanding the exportWAV. I didn't realize that the callback was being passed the WAV, I thought the default callback was the functionality of the function and then the callback was being called after the default
<cjohnson>	alpha59: I believe then if you take that blob data on your backend and simply write it to a .wav file you should have audio
<Sorella>	bradleymeck: type erasure isn't much of a problem, imho. But Dart optional type systems are not that intersting for me.
<Sorella>	interesting, even.
<bradleymeck>	Sorella: ive been bitten by it and generics in multiple languages
<bradleymeck>	it is not to be trusted
<alpha59>	yeah, from there I am covered. I was just misunderstanding that function. So if you're right then this shouldnt be an issue.
<alpha59>	thank you cjohnson.
<cjohnson>	no prob
<bradleymeck>	anytime I see a segfault in a language due to type erasure I go and hide, wondering if random parts of my code have holes that can blow up
<lapi0>	http://pastebin.com/3b6BdzZe syntax error, I have no idea what's wron
<bradleymeck>	cause type erasure means that it is just treating objects as blobs and could be reading the wrong data :((
<bradleymeck>	even worse than just crashing
<cjohnson>	no semi-colon after closing curly brace for if lapi0
<cjohnson>	semi-colon ends a statement and yours isn't ended -- you still have the else to go
<cjohnson>	whereas line 8 *does* end that statement, so thats fine
<Sorella>	bradleymeck: well, in Dart you don't really have types, so you can't have segfaults, but you'll have runtime errors
<Sorella>	(Whether the type checker says your code is good or not)
<Sorella>	you don't really have types, but all errors are trapped*
<lapi0>	cjohnson: ofc, thanks a lot
<cjohnson>	the one after the else is unnecessary too but won't cause a syntax error

<javascript278>	Sorella: So, i find your article very complete and I began ... a French traduction ^^
<Sorella>	javascript278: oh, great :D
<javascript278>	Sorella: I wanted to send you this traduction
<gildarts>	I personally find it stranger to think about having multiple people in my head since I am being referred to in the plural.
<zap0>	Sorella, as much as you are arguing for popular/proper english grammar.  `it` makes a lot more sense to non-english speakers.
<Sorella>	If you send me a link to it, I'll be more than happy to include it on the article. I'm afraid I can't help much with the translation though ahaha
<zomg>	zap0: not really. At least in my case the translation for "it" translates to something that's used for inanimate objects and considered rather rude for people
<Sorella>	zap0: yeah, and people dislike being called 'it', so you don't use it.
<gildarts>	(better than my business law professor who always referred to himself in the third person *shudders*)
<javascript278>	Sorella: I traduced (sorry for "tradxxx" repetitions ahah :) ) the document until the part "2" :-)
<natmyers>	english really could use a gender neutral pronoun
<gildarts>	^
<Sorella>	natmyers: 'they' :P
<javascript278>	Sorella: Yes of course, I'll send you that when it'll be finished :-)
<zomg>	how about "shim"
<zomg>	hue hue
<natmyers>	well, a singular one anyway haha
<natmyers>	I've seen 'yo' used, which I thought was pretty great
<Sorella>	natmyers: it has always been that. Until XVIII, where they tried to make 'he' the gender neutral pronoun, then it slowly went back to 'they' again.
<zap0>	see that baby over there... IT farted.     <-- are you suggesting 'they' is more correct?
<Sorella>	natmyers: 'they' is singular.
<zomg>	zap0: in my opinion "it" is fine for babies because babies are annoying as hell ;)
<javascript278>	Sorella: so could you send me your email please ? :p
<Sorella>	zap0: there's no such thing as 'more correct' there. But one could argue 'they' expresses more human sentiments for the person you're addressing. It's all about empathy in the end
<Sorella>	javascript278: it's on the about page of the blog :)
<javascript278>	Sorella: so queen@robotlolita is RLY your RLY email ? x)
<Sorella>	Some people do use `ze/zir/hir` and other sets of pronouns.
<Sorella>	queen at robotlolita.me, yes
<javascript278>	Sorella: I thought it was like a joke, idk.. ^^'
<javascript278>	Ok :)
<gildarts>	I saw someone refer to English as an eldritch language :P
<ajf->	Java
<javascript278>	I don't have enough time, Sorella, but I wanted to speak about Zeste de Savoir with you.. it's in relation with your article and my traduction
<Sorella>	gildarts: there are worse languages. Portuguese is pretty awful imho
<zap0>	'they' is still very much plural.   most of human disbute is about being grouped into things that you are not.    `they` is a dangerous word to use if empathy is the goal.
<javascript278>	Sorella: in fact, Zeste de Savoir is a web site like OpenClassroom (idk if you know it.. xD) and it contains a lot of computer science tutorials
<ajf->	Redhoop
<gildarts>	Sorella, I really wouldn't know. I have tried to learn spanish, chinese, and japanese, but have never been able to. Started too late and was too lazy about it.
<javascript278>	Sorella: so I wanted to know if you were okay if i put my traduction of your article in Zeste de Savoir (i'll put into the tutorial your website's URL, your login/name, etc. ^^)
<Sorella>	zap0: 'they' has *always* been used as singular gender-neutral pronoun. Just pick up any English writer who lived before XVIII, like Shakespeare
<Sorella>	javascript278: I don't know what Zeste de Savoir is, but you're free to put your translation anywhere. All of the contents in my blog are released under a CC licence.
<javascript278>	Sorella: in fact, Zeste de Savoir is a web site like OpenClassroom (idk if you know it.. xD) and it contains a lot of computer science tutorials
<javascript278>	Sorella: okay :)

<beaky>	hello
<foofin>	Hello!
<beaky>	why are es6 fat arrow functions fat (i.e. use =>) vs skinny (->)
<beaky>	like java lambdas
<cjohnson>	maybe ask ljharb? I don't see a real reason other than "personal preference"
<zomg>	I suspect it's because of the CoffeeScript inspiration
<cjohnson>	maybe just easier to handle in the interpreter/whatever
<davidosomething>	how can i simplify this browserification with external bundles? https://github.com/davidosomething/coffeetest/blob/master/Gruntfile.coffee
<beaky>	oh
<zomg>	CoffeeScript had both, fat and thin arrows. Thin arrow in CS didn't bind `this`
<cjohnson>	so wouldn't that point to ES6 using thin arrows?
<cjohnson>	if that were the inspiration
<zomg>	No because the fat arrow in CS was much more useful
<beaky>	ah
<zomg>	Thin arrow didn't really have any purpose at all
<zomg>	I mean you could just use a fat arrow pretty much anywhere where you would use a thin arrow and the behavior would be no different
<beaky>	i thought es6 wasnt inspired at all from coffeescript
<zomg>	I seem to recall that it was somewhat inspired by it, I could be entirely wrong though :P
<beaky>	https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9264531 yep fat arrows were inpsired from cs  (second comment from parent and top)

<nucleartide2>	beaky: i know greensock is an animation library
<zomg>	nixnerd: we've used Greensock for some animation work yes
<godzirra>	If I've got an array, how come arrayObj.forEach(function(row) { console.log(row); }); is throwing an "undefined is not a function" error?
<beaky>	wow that greensock thing is awesome
<zomg>	Greensock is really good for certain types of animation stuff yeah

<zomg>	(we have a browser based tool to build HTML5 based responsive ads)
<javascript372>	im unable to parse the array into the list http://pastebin.com/eEyGSUMA
<beaky>	godzirra:  maybe either console.log or arrayObj.forEach is not defined

<zomg>	nixnerd: we've had pretty good results with it, even on mobile devices
<godzirra>	Let me create a gist.
<yansanmo>	godzirra, .length exists on a lot of objects

<zomg>	beaky: write more code I think.
<Torqable>	learn a functional language

<zomg>	something that I found quite useful to learn was unit testing, and indeed as Torqable said, functional languages can be quite interesting as well
<beaky>	yes haskell changed the way i code... for the worse :( now instead of writing nice clean object-oriented code i write tons of pure functions and  chains of maps and reduce :(

<cythrawll>	you guys know of any good small ajax lib that supports cors (even on old ie versions that use XDomainRequest?
<bradleymeck>	but it is not being researched much right now
<Torqable>	super sad about the higher level functions in rust
<pandeiro>	anyone know how I can insert a value (html) into the medium-editor.js editor? don't see it anywhere here https://github.com/daviferreira/medium-editor/tree/4.8.0
<bradleymeck>	macros are super sadness for dynamic languages w/ mutation if you don't want to destroy the world
<Torqable>	can't decide if I want to keep going with rust
<beaky>	sorella hah true with macros i end up thinking 'if only i can use language feature x in my macros'
<bradleymeck>	or you could just trust your macro authors /scared laugh
*	zoite is now known as Guest92083
<lalaland1125>	bradleymeck, What's the trouble with macros and mutation?
<beaky>	yeah arent macros side-effect-less
<lalaland1125>	They seem quite orthogonal to each other.
<bradleymeck>	lalaland1125: if a macro parser is allowed to mutate scopes you get into problems, and macros as they are presented / talked about are allowed to execute code during parsing
<lalaland1125>	What do you mean by "scopes"?
<beaky>	scopes are like implicit namespaces
<bradleymeck>	hygenic macros are to avoid language parser clashes, but most macros still use some sort of storage mechanism if they cannot perform a code transform
<bradleymeck>	lalaland1125: similar to how function introduces a scope for variables, and function* introduces a scope with a new keyword `yield`
<bradleymeck>	having some syntax in JS to show macros are in use for this area
<beaky>	wow theres two kinds of functions in js?
<bradleymeck>	beaky: function* is a generator
<beaky>	(now three thanks to arrows)
<beaky>	oh
<beaky>	are those like pythons'
<bradleymeck>	kinda, but you can push values back into a generator
*	Torqable remains skeptical of generators
<bradleymeck>	let x = yield y; // y is provided by .next(...)
<cjohnson>	javascript372: you need to add dataType: 'json' to your ajax command
<bradleymeck>	Torqable: how so?
<cjohnson>	(or send the proper headers from your server)
<Torqable>	just not convinced they really bring anything to the table
<bradleymeck>	x is provided by*
<cjohnson>	otherwise "cars" is merely a string containing the response, and not a parsed JSON structure
<bradleymeck>	Torqable: they are a book keeping mechanism
<cjohnson>	and then yeah you want to rename the argument from "cars" to "data" sincei t gives you the *entire* result, and not just one arbitrary property of the top level object
<cjohnson>	and use $.each(data.cars
<bradleymeck>	Torqable: they give you `finally` across multiple function values, which I love
<cjohnson>	(but really you should use data.cars.forEach(function(car, i) {
<bradleymeck>	rest I don't really care too much about
<Torqable>	all the examples I've seen involve these big messy hard to read functions just so you can write synchronous-style function calls
<beaky>	wow if js will have generators thats probably like a gamechanger for stuff like event streams
<cjohnson>	generators and async/await are def gonna change it up a lot
<bradleymeck>	ugg async/await
<bradleymeck>	just use a generator
<Torqable>	idk, I just have yet to see a non-trivial example of generators improving something
<Sorella>	bradleymeck: I don't find Sweet.js macros insane, but lexical ones aren't bad either (I'm considering something similar for Purr).
<bradleymeck>	Torqable: how do you do cleanup when an async task fails halfway?
<Sorella>	beaky: well, you can implement those features in Smalltalk without macros :D
<Torqable>	bradleymeck: it returns an error
<cjohnson>	bradleymeck: lot harder to keep track of mentally
<cjohnson>	I'm not aiming for cleverness here, I just want to get my work done as quickly and simply as possible
<bradleymeck>	Torqable: and if you wrote a file to disk? do you just leave it there?
<bradleymeck>	cjohnson: ??
<cjohnson>	!!
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: !! is a convenient shorthand for converting a truthy/falsy value to true/false, similar to the more verbose `Boolean` function.
<Torqable>	bradleymeck: maybe, maybe not
<cjohnson>	My brain reads things top-down. It's much simpler to understand if I can read the code in the order that it fires
<bradleymeck>	Torqable: the point is with generators you can get `finally {}` to do your cleanup regardless of if there was an error or if their was a success
<cjohnson>	generators require context switching to use in the same use case as async/await
<cjohnson>	with async/await I can just keep reading in teh way that my brain normally reads all things
<bradleymeck>	cjohnson: kinda, they work fine w/ task.js / galaxy / generator runner
<Torqable>	sounds like a promise chain only I have to write a big goofy generator handler function
<cjohnson>	I'd rather just use native things
<lalaland1125>	bradleymeck, You can do that with promises too.
<cjohnson>	if it requires a lib to make it easier to use, it defeats the purpose of including it in the stdlib
<bradleymeck>	lalaland1125: not until .finally becomes a thing
<bradleymeck>	Torqable: ^
<Torqable>	I use finally on promise chains every day
<bradleymeck>	and even then, you should read up on memory/file leaks in bluebird and .using
<Torqable>	not sure where you're going with this
<cjohnson>	not es6 promises though Torqable
<bradleymeck>	Torqable: it is in some libraries it is not in ES6 promises
<Torqable>	so
<cjohnson>	but how often do you need success/error handled in the same exact function?
<cjohnson>	not that hard to do .then(success, error)
<bradleymeck>	https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/blob/master/API.md#resource-management
<cjohnson>	at the end
<cjohnson>	worst case you just do .then(done, done)
<cjohnson>	and define done on the line above
<bradleymeck>	cjohnson: a lot for me? but I do a lot with files and file locking?
<Torqable>	like I said, not convinced it brings anything to the table
<cjohnson>	I've never had it come up, not saying it doesn't happen
<bradleymeck>	Torqable: sure, but thats how I feel about promises quite often
<godzirra>	Can anyone tell me why I'm having errors here?  I assume they're scoping errors, but I don't understand what's going on.  https://gist.github.com/slooker/c4bfb2bad418d99d7c94
<bradleymeck>	its a matter of what kind of work you do
<cjohnson>	just that very rare. and in the few cases it does, you can just as easily do the .then(done, done) I gave above
<cjohnson>	you forgot to tell us what your errors are godzirra
<bradleymeck>	cjohnson: read the resource-management link, also I'm guessing you don't have promises that work with file descriptors / pass open connections around
<cjohnson>	ohh I see, erroneous output
<cjohnson>	yeah godzirra your problem is scoping. you're defining the variable in the upper scope so all the calls share that same variable
<cjohnson>	so they each override it, and *then* all your callbacks fire
<cjohnson>	using the last value
<cjohnson>	I'm assuming you have this code inside a loop
<godzirra>	cjohnson: Yeah, I'm adding the loop now.
<cjohnson>	easiest solution is to wrap it in a function (wrap it in .forEach instead of using a for)
<bradleymeck>	Sorella: the last few times I have tried to use sweet.js I ended up having to use the streaming parser thing they give you. it felt insane
<cjohnson>	if you have to use for/while, use an iife
<cjohnson>	!iife
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: An "immediately invoked function expression" is an expression that both creates and calls a function. As with any function call, a scope is created. "(function () { /* ... */ }())" is the most common form. For more info: http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
<godzirra>	cjohnson: So I tried that, but it's not an actual array. It's just array-ish.
<cjohnson>	iife then. but that also smells of bad data design
<cjohnson>	if you're looping over object keys
<Sorella>	bradleymeck: ah, yeah, if you need to get to that level, it's definitely awful. Dylan handles it better.
<cjohnson>	alternatively you can do Object.keys(foo).forEach
<cjohnson>	to loop over foo's keys
<godzirra>	Well, I'm looping over an array of objects, it seems.
<godzirra>	It's the output of csvtojson
<godzirra>	Let me try that.
<cjohnson>	if you're looping over an array, you should have .forEach
<cjohnson>	doesn't matter what the elements are
<vikaton>	Can anyone tell me why this isnt working? :/
<vikaton>	site: http://stackin.money:8080/bin2txt
<Sorella>	bradleymeck: it's also not nice if you need to use reader macros =/
<vikaton>	JS: http://stackin.money/js/t2b.js
<bradleymeck>	Sorella: you have seen more of sweet.js than I will probably ever see
<bradleymeck>	so I trust you there
<godzirra>	cjohnson: It's not an actual array though.  At least not according to jsonObj.constructor.
<owen1>	why jshint does't complain about undefined variable and about unused variable? https://github.com/oren/test-jshint/blob/master/.jshint
<cjohnson>	godzirra: jsonObj instanceof Array
<cjohnson>	true or false?
<godzirra>	Let me check.  I was doing jsonObj.constructor === Array.
<godzirra>	True.
<lalaland1125>	I think macros can be too easily abused.
<lalaland1125>	I would personally avoid using any libraries which overly relies on them.

<lalaland1125>	You will see that "text.value.replaceAll is not a function"
<cjohnson>	godzirra: alright, then it's an array. you should be able to use .forEach
<godzirra>	cjohnson: I swear I tried this before.  I have no idae anymore.  I'm changing it back to forEach.

<ecmabot>	vikaton: What do you mean it doesn't work? Is it unemployed? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? What did you want or expect to happen?
<godzirra>	I swear I tried that.  erg.  Thanks.

<beaky>	is it a good idea to use es6 template strings literally everywhere?
<Renari>	Thanks I'll try that.
<beaky>	since they are a superset of normal strings
<bradleymeck>	Renari: i would change your fn signature, make that big list of variable number arguments to an array
<bradleymeck>	might even be able to cache the array for the future
<bradleymeck>	beaky: is it a good idea to use $x everywhere? no
<beaky>	so to make things nice and consistent i backtick all my strings... also works out my pinkies :D
<beaky>	:(
<ljharb>	beaky: es6 template strings are just "interpolated string literals"
<ljharb>	so, you should only use them if you're interpolating.
<beaky>	right
<bradleymeck>	something something promises everywhere something something callbacks everywhere something something classes
<ljharb>	just like in ruby/php/languages where double/single quotes matter, you only use double quotes where you need interpolation
<beaky>	yeah those langs give me a hard time when i have to think 'hmm does this string interpolate or not'

<beaky>	how do i get the client's timezone in js
<ljharb>	matthavard: that said, it's probably a great idea for every URL on your server to automatically change any "&#241;" to "ñ" and redirect :-)
<ljharb>	!mdn gettimezoneoffset @ beaky
<ecmabot>	beaky: Date.prototype.getTimezoneOffset() - JavaScript | MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getTimezoneOffset>
<ljharb>	you can't get their actual timezone tho.
<beaky>	ah :(
<ljharb>	since timezones depend on the country too.
<beaky>	right
<ljharb>	the only way to get that reliably is to ask the user.
<owen1>	ljharb: thanks!
<ljharb>	np
<ljharb>	gildarts called it
<gildarts>	Heh, I just checked jshint -h in my command line.
*	mwizard_ is now known as mwizard
<matthavard>	ljharb: But it's not just rendering &#241; - that would be a literal `n` with a tilda character.  It's replacing &#241; with %c3%b1 - utf-8'd and urlencoded
<ljharb>	matthavard: make a jsfiddle?
<ljharb>	i'll show you what to fix
<matthavard>	Well this isn't my page; it's a page I'm crawling.  Campbell's has a bunch of url's in their sitemap that have these html entities.  So I should probably head over to #python to figure out how to achieve the same rendering that happens in the href attribute automatically
<matthavard>	because *my* server is in python
<matthavard>	and that's from whence I am requesting these bad urls
<matthavard>	ljharb: But here's a fiddle if you can still help me, now knowing what my actual problem is: http://jsfiddle.net/3vmymyyx/
<ljharb>	the url's fine, but you have to html-render things you're scraping
<ljharb>	since it'll have html entities in it.
<ljharb>	but just be aware that scraping/crawling is illegal in many countries
<matthavard>	ljharb: I'm in the US and Campbell's is one of our clients, so I think we're good haha
<ljharb>	it's illegal in the US, but if they're your client, then you're good :-)
<gildarts>	Since when is scraping illegal in the US? Assuming of course public web pages?
<ljharb>	it's a gray area. some guy scraped AT&T's site a few years back and found phone numbers of ipads, and went to jail for it (and unfortunately didn't go to jail for the other horrible things he did, just for this bs)
<matthavard>	ljharb: Tell me more. How is outlawing crawling/scraping even enforceable?  How are the search engines able to get away with it?
<ljharb>	automated scraping is a different legal category than accessing a webpage in a browser.
<ljharb>	search engines a) respect robots.txt, and b) that's why it's a gray area.
<ljharb>	if you're indexing, you're probably fine, but if you're storing any content, you may not be.
<gildarts>	I thought the only reason that case was decided the way it was, was because the page in question was not generally publicly accessible.
<DarkElement>	 Hey guys, looking to run some phantomJS code with the phantomjs-node package for node.js. Here is the file I'm working on, with phantom-node code commented, and phantomJS code as the rest of the file. Hope you guys can help:http://paste.pound-python.org/show/o1S5Ic1Yt6tLa3la4njr/
<gildarts>	I will have to dig up the legal articles I read on it sometime ago.
<ljharb>	gildarts: "publicly accessible" doesn't mean "linked to", it means "no authentication protecting it".
<ljharb>	but that's the legal issue, at any rate.
<OtherAllan>	gildarts: to save you some time, here's one: http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20130710170719460
<gildarts>	ljharb, right I would agree with that meaning, but iirc there was no protection on the page, just no links to it.
<matthavard>	Ok, so I know Craigslist has a really strict policy against third party apps crawling their site for data (they don't have an api for 3rd party developers either) - I've heard of cease and desists for apps that try to reverse engineer an api for Craigslist.  But you can get direct links to ads by google searching.  Does Google have a special agreement with Craigslist, or is what google does different from an app like tha
<felixjet_>	how i can pass "this" using arrow functions inside setinterval?
<ljharb>	gildarts: that's right
<ljharb>	felixjet_: you don't "pass" it

<ljharb>	felixjet_: arrow functions have lexical this
<ljharb>	but also, don't use setInterval, use recursive setTimeout
<felixjet_>	i mean how i can pass "this"
<felixjet_>	how i can convert that to an arrow function
<felixjet_>	why not setinterval?
<matthavard>	ljharb: Why is setTimeout better than setInterval?

<gildarts>	OtherAllan, thanks! I will also dig up whatever popehat wrote about it.

<ljharb>	matthavard: ^
<matthavard>	ha thanks
<felixjet_>	thanks
<ljharb>	felixjet_: what does the actual function look like
<felixjet_>	setInterval(model.update, 10000); <--
<ljharb>	ok so `model.update.bind(model)`
<ljharb>	you can't "convert" that to an arrow function
<felixjet_>	and inside update() i need access to "this" in the "model" context, not in the set***** context
<felixjet_>	thanks
<ljharb>	np
<felixjet_>	i was trying to use arrow function but didn't know how
<deltab>	() => model.update()
<ljharb>	that would work too ^
<ljharb>	but "bind" is more explicit imo
<ljharb>	and doesn't require transpilation
*	deltab nods
<lalaland1125>	ljharb, The counterargument is that arrow functions are more intuitive and more clear than bind.
<Sorella>	How are they more intuitive and clear? O.o
<lalaland1125>	They are more clear in that having binds scattered around makes the code harder to read.

<foofin>	Hello!
<xpheres>	I would like to ask a cross-theme question
<xpheres>	I would like to start a career as a web developer
<lalaland1125>	They are more intuitive because of the correct lexical scoping of this.
<xpheres>	I wonder if anyone here is professionally working in that field
<ljharb>	lalaland1125: fair. i disagree with a few of those points tho
<ljharb>	xpheres: most of us are.
<ljharb>	lalaland1125: lexical scoping of "this" isn't "correct"
<ljharb>	it just may be more intuitive to people who have *incorrect* notions of JS because of familiarity with other languages.
<Sorella>	How is it not "correct"?
<xpheres>	my question is, I don't have professional experience, and I would like to find a job and start a career
<ljharb>	Sorella: i don't mean it's incorrect. i mean that it's not solely correct.
<xpheres>	I don't know how to start or try, what to learn and improve and how to market myself
<ljharb>	"lexical this" is just one of the 8? i think? meanings of "this" in JavaScript.
<ljharb>	and is new in ES6.

<xpheres>	doc work
<xpheres>	I have a github website with a few small codes
<ljharb>	keriati: "match all" requires a trick with replace.
<doc|work>	xpheres: build some sites, even basic ones that show your skills, to start. It gets you experience at the deep end.
<Sorella>	lalaland1125: I'd particularly argue that both `() => foo.bar()` and `foo.bar.bind(foo)` are equally "unreadable," but there's not much of a way around that in JS.
<keriati>	ljharb like?
<mindstorm8191>	afternoon everyone
<deltab>	keriati: does it have to be spaces, or any non-letter/digit? if the latter, use \b
<keriati>	non letter/digit
<ljharb>	>> var str = 'as1d as3d foo as2d basd4a', matches = []; str.replace(/ (as\dd) /g, function (match, group1) { matches.push(group1); }); matches @ keriati

<ljharb>	keriati: then you put those in your regex

<ljharb>	or, you split the string into words, and iterate on that array.
<ljharb>	shiftins: not usually, no.

<shiftins>	do you have time to provide details, or do you know of a link where this is discussed?
<keriati>	ljharb if I use this custom char i have problems in places where the separator is between 2 matches
<ljharb>	keriati: try splitting it first then. overusing regex is messy.

<PhonicUK>	serses, then you need a new copy in a private scope
<serses>	i need to loop over the keys
<serses>	and set them?
<PhonicUK>	so inside change() you'd have a copy of object, and you'd need a get() method that returned it
<PhonicUK>	and set() would change stuff on the private member
<serses>	but it will change the obj outside the function?
<PhonicUK>	serses, no
<serses>	well i need to change that
<ljharb>	no you don't
<ljharb>	don't mutate things.
<PhonicUK>	serses, to modify the obj outside the function then you have to either set it (obj = myFunction(obj);) or change the individual properties
<PhonicUK>	although as ljharb, if you're doing that at all - it's bad design
<ljharb>	(js is pass by reference, so direct assignment is never visible above the current scope)
<ljharb>	oops i mean pass by value
<ljharb>	*not* pass by reference.
<serses>	i try to implement a undo/redo on a object
<serses>	it is getting very messy
<serses>	that's why i need to modify the obj outside the function scope
<PhonicUK>	serses, maintain a stack of object states, don't manipulate the object directly
<PhonicUK>	for undo/redo
<ljharb>	yep, use an array of objects.
<ljharb>	each state is a copy. don't mutate.
<PhonicUK>	FIFO
<serses>	yeah i keep that state = [obj1,obj2,...]
<ljharb>	ok, so you don't want to change the objects.
<ljharb>	you just want to copy it, and put the new one on the state.
<serses>	so i should keep a copy of the obj inside the function and change it as i want

<dna113p>	hi. I'm still somewhat a javascript noob and can't figure this out. (Maybe a reactjs jsx issue?) How do I get the correct <mark> functionality? The magic happens on line 52 https://jsfiddle.net/gn03w1ab/
<lalaland1125>	serses, I think http://paste.ofcode.org/6W2KsHV8SwBkTQAg8auEgG is more correct.
<lalaland1125>	http://paste.ofcode.org/pcqKp3hp4UE3HVvUCjjLMU
<serses>	okay thanks
<lalaland1125>	dna113p, Hmm, second time this question has come around. You can use raw html. https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/dangerously-set-inner-html.html
<lalaland1125>	(For a very crude, bad solution vulnerable to XSS)
<lalaland1125>	The better solution is to dynamically create an array of child elements for the <p>
<lalaland1125>	So like [Rearct.createElement("mark", ...), "Javascript standard ..." Rearct.createElement("mark", ...), "blah"]
<lalaland1125>	Note the alternation between mark elements and normal text.

<Sorella>	Facebook is also full of Haskell developers :D

<jaawerth>	Angular 2.0 is both less java-ey and more
<jaawerth>	it's kinda weird
<jaawerth>	they added a TON of FP-friendly stuff to it and yet...
<jaawerth>	so much of the new DI is based (by default, anyway) on ES6 classes
<Hannibal_Smith>	Sorella, I think is normal as OCaml don't require that a dev has to learn too many things before even doing some IO
<Sorella>	W-well, Kin-iro Mosaic and Show by Rock are just too adorable, I can't help it ; ~ ;
<Sorella>	Hannibal_Smith: that's true.
<Sorella>	Hannibal_Smith: they've also been using OCaml for quite a while there, but Haskell is only used for Haxl I think?
<jaawerth>	google's weird though because then you've also got things like closurescript
<jaawerth>	er
<jaawerth>	clojurescript
<Hannibal_Smith>	Sorella, well they probably will use Haskell for some internal things
<Sorella>	True. I guess OCaml is mostly used for their PLs and language analysis tools
<jaawerth>	then again, clojure itself is JVM-based so it makes sense
<Sorella>	(And the PHP/Flow IDE I think)
<jaawerth>	I'm not sold on flow
<Hannibal_Smith>	Sorella, personally I'm happy with that, simply because I like OCaml approach
<jaawerth>	oh wait, no, I like flow
<jaawerth>	it's flux I'm not sold on
<beaky>	can fat arrow funcs be nested? var s = (f) => (g) => (x) => f(x)(g(x))
<gkatsev>	beaky: sure
<Sorella>	Yeah, I don't like Flux either. Rx makes more sense to me as a thing to build your event streams on
<beaky>	idk i find flux intuitive
<jaawerth>	beaky: yeah, you're effectively doing partial application and/or currying when you do it ;-)
<Sorella>	beaky: yup. And you can write it as `var s = f => g => x => f(x)(g(x))`, I think
<beaky>	wow u can remove the parens?

<jaawerth>	gkatsev: that's a neat one
<gkatsev>	if only we had true pattern matching :(
<beaky>	yes i know alot of places i can abuse fat arrows
<beaky>	for great good
<mmmveggies>	why match patterns when you can `just format ${stuff}` ?
<gkatsev>	?
<gkatsev>	they're different things
<beaky>	fat arrows are so awesome i now declare all of my functions as `const f = x => x;` instead of `function f(x) { return x; }`
<gkatsev>	pattern matching is like destructuring but even more powerful
<beaky>	ye pattern matching combines dispatch with destructuring
<mmmveggies>	I'm sure you can implement a %0.2f type deal
<jaawerth>	that'd be tough to do well dynimcally though
<beaky>	(which i think rich hickey said is bad in his talk)
<jaawerth>	dynamically*
<gkatsev>	mmmveggies: sure, but that's orthogonal to what I'm talking about
<mmmveggies>	I mean, I know C has had it for decades
<jaawerth>	it's easier to do well in compiled languages
<Hannibal_Smith>	Sorella, thining about it OCaml don't even has a inflix function for function composition, they prefer a style like let foo path = String.split ~on:':' path  |> List.dedup ~compare:String.compare  |> List.iter ~f:print_endline..uses monad for thing that make sense like async IO...

<gkatsev>	use babeljs if you're using features not currently implemented in browsers

<jaawerth>	beaky: you can use any extension, babel will transpile a list of defaults (including .js and .es6) out of the box, but you can also set a list of target extensions
<jaawerth>	of course, using anything but .js can get annoying when using syntax highlighting and linting in an editor

<ezakimak>	you're loading a raw txt file into an iframe? not wrapped in an html page?

<Will>	raw txt
<Will>	but from the same index's directory
<ezakimak>	well, raw text is not html, so there's your answer
<ezakimak>	if you want it decorated you'll need to mark it up and style it
<Will>	so there's no way to loop through it and add the taks?
<Will>	tags*
<ezakimak>	if it's not html tags are just data
<ezakimak>	the browser has to be told to interpret tags as semantic--meaning it must be loaded as html
<ezakimak>	you could create an iframe, load it with an empty html document, and inject the txt into the body, then go edit programmatically
<Will>	hmm, guess there's no easy way to do that on demand then
<ezakimak>	(or better, edit it before adding it to the body)
<Will>	hmmm
<ezakimak>	easy? it shouldn't be too hard
<ezakimak>	why does it have to be an iframe?
<ezakimak>	could just be a div
<ezakimak>	well, an iframe is safer

<kevireilly>	If you were trying to troubleshoot sluggishness when rendering DOM elements to the page from JavaScript, where would you start? Broad question, I know, just curious if anyone might have any random ideas that I haven’t tried yet. CPU profiling, paint profiling, requestAnimationFrame, and microoptimizing with microbenchmarks are some things that have been explored
<kevireilly>	I think I need to circle back to CPU profiling, but I fear that things were potentially so spread out that it was hard to find any one (or multiple) potential sources of contention
<Dexx1_>	ezakimak: doing: Math.round(info.volume / 1000).toFixed(2) --- and the result is 3500.00 instead of 3500.65 (It omits the last two numbers and replaces them with 00) ...ideas?
<ezakimak>	so don't round it
<ezakimak>	just toFixed(2) it
<ezakimak>	round will go up or down to the nearest integer. what do you exactly want?
<Dexx1_>	ezakimak: same thing
<Dexx1_>	ezakimak: even without Math.Round, I get the same result
<natmyers>	kevireilly: how are you inserting the dom fragments in the dom?
<ezakimak>	what result do you want?
<Dexx1_>	ezakimak: nvm, i fucked it up
<Dexx1_>	my bad
<natmyers>	one thing that can really help is if you modify the dom as few times as possible by constructing your dom fragments fully before you insert it into the dom
<ezakimak>	also throttle your event handling, eg for scroll events, drags, animations, etc.
<mmmveggies>	is there a recommended unit testing framework I should build my express application on?
<GreenJello>	mmmveggies, mocha is good, and you can add in supertest for testing the server
<Torqable>	mocha
<mmmveggies>	-_-

<kevireilly_>	natmyers: I believe appendChild is being used recursively but that is an excellent question that I should explore (not my code). You're generally going where I was with paint profiling and trying to reduce the amount of reflows and repaints into a single pass. Also along the lines of requestAnimationFrame trials

<ggdevelop>	hi im learning about web worker, can some body can explain how is it  that the worker thread dont know the dome, whrere is it running?
<Hannibal_Smith>	ggdevelop, because it would not be thread safe
<kevireilly_>	ezakimak: there are some custom events being bound and triggered but this is a general area I should look more in to as well
<GreenJello>	ggdevelop, all of the dom/js/etc, stuff happens on a single thread, and in other threads you don't have access to it
<GreenJello>	ggdevelop, this is because the dom apis are synchronous, and you can only do async things across threads in JS because we don't have locks or blocking
<ezakimak>	just think of a ww as a thread where you can do ajax, message passing, and processing all w/o blocking the UI
<ljharb>	ajax doesn't block the ui anyways
<ljharb>	it's really just processing :-)
<ezakimak>	no, but it can w/the synchronous flag
<GreenJello>	they are working on async dom apis so you can use them in workers, but it's at least a year out

<Torqable>	thank you
<kevireilly>	one thing I’m still not so sure about is how these DOM elements are being constructed which essentially involves a data attribute of parseable JavaScript that is ran against a new Function instance to determine things like visibility, children to create, and things of that nature
<GreenJello>	kevireilly, you get the most noteworthy performance gains by touching the dom as little as possible
<GreenJello>	if you can render 10 items and have a show more button, it's about 100 times more performant than rendering 1,000 items
<GreenJello>	if you can change a single className instead of replacing an element, that's also faster
<ezakimak>	kevireilly, sounds like you are using some form of templating library.
<kevireilly>	GreenJello: that makes sense indeed. I wonder if things like getAttribute(‘data-foo’) counts as touching the DOM and taking a hit on layout calculation, but I would imagine that it is more about actually changing the DOM element like style, attributes, classes, and that sort of thing
<kevireilly>	I did read about a lot of attributes that cause a layout calculation like offsetTop and various things that require an up to date answer and evaluation by extension
<GreenJello>	it does count as touching the dom; keep your data in JS and just push it down to the dom when it changes
<kevireilly>	ezakimak: correct
<GreenJello>	getAttribute doesn't require layout, but it's still orders of magnitude more expensive than looking up a key in an object
<kevireilly>	a lot of these roads are leading to re-thinking the general approach being taken here
<kevireilly>	GreenJello: hmm yeah I see what you’re saying
<Torqable>	what's the state of phonegap
<GreenJello>	eh
<kevireilly>	this is essentially a fork of knockoutjs I believe
<Torqable>	last I used it, you ended up with an app that really just felt like a web page
<Torqable>	(because it was)
<GreenJello>	that's still true
<ezakimak>	who forked ko?
<Torqable>	k
<ezakimak>	ko 3 has made some great improvements
<GreenJello>	I wonder if you can use ko as a full UI layer now
<GreenJello>	I used it quite a bit in 2.x, but it almost always fell short
<kevireilly>	ezakimak: interesting, I’ll have to take a gander and see what might be different
<ezakimak>	big fixes, speed improvements, "pure" observables, a whole new component system
<ezakimak>	and an optional customizable rendering plugin system
<ezakimak>	eg, you could plug in handlebars if you really wanted
<__str__>	hello there, does anybody knows if the red audio icon (placed inside the tab while recording) can be removed after a recording is finished?
<javascript559>	What is the best way for me to pull data from a div into excel format?
<kevireilly>	ezakimak: sounds promising! handlerbars has crossed my mind a couple times for some reason amidst the evaluations
<GreenJello>	__str__, you probably just have to destroy the audio context or release all references to it
<ezakimak>	i don't recommend handlebars, or any string-based templating
<Torqable>	https://github.com/Microsoft/node
<Torqable>	wtf
<GreenJello>	(I know very little about that, so I'm not sure on the specifics)
<mrkie>	hey
*	mrkie is now known as jrkie
<kevireilly>	ezakimak: what do you prefer?
<__str__>	is there a recommended order of detroying? I have the audio node, and the audio context from it
<ezakimak>	semantic templating, eg dom-based like ko, or react's library
<ezakimak>	sorella has a great post on why
<javascript559>	and also is there any way to have a live website  able to run offline?  I have a site running and I want to be able to make changes to the elements without doing them live
<ezakimak>	define "live"
<Sorella>	kevireilly: http://robotlolita.me/2013/09/22/the-importance-of-being-typed.html
<kevireilly>	ezakimak: ah gotcha. I’m not familiar with react’s but will probably peep it out of curiosity
<ezakimak>	yep. that one.
<kevireilly>	thanks Sorella :)
<GreenJello>	__str__, you don't need to worry about the dom node, just the stuff you do on top of it
<ezakimak>	i'm a fan of ko over react, but it's really a matter of preference
<javascript559>	ezak meaning the site is live running off the server
<ezakimak>	that is still too vague
<__str__>	GreenJello: I'll play a bit with that, thank you
<ezakimak>	and doesn't actually make sense
<kevireilly>	has anyone been playing with custom elements? I don’t have a fully formed idea of how it might solve similar problems, but it is pretty interesting to me in general
<kevireilly>	document.registerElement
<ezakimak>	ko components can make use of them
<javascript559>	I have a site setup for work schedules with personnel cards where I can drag and drop boxes into a desired shift.  I want to be able to make changes to this without doing this on the live server.
<javascript559>	I tried to just save the webpage in chrome but that doesnt work well

<ecmabot>	javascript559: Window.localStorage - Web API Interfaces | MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage>
<GreenJello>	kevireilly, it's a neat idea for widgets in blogs, etc., or things like a facebook like button, but not useful for applications because it has the same problems that exist currently with the dom
*	matp_ is now known as matp
<GreenJello>	e.g. <foo bar="1"> is this the number 1 or the string "1"?
<ezakimak>	they don't really solve anything that you can't already do
<ezakimak>	string
<GreenJello>	but what if I want to pass a number?
<kevireilly>	hrm what about the notion that you can add custom methods, getters, setters, and what not
<ezakimak>	you can't
<jrkie>	hello, i have a very basic question here, can someone help? i need to activate play when the document is loaded, it is now activated with a button: http://jsfiddle.net/5r02pf9u/ thanks in advance
<ezakimak>	you can already do that
<GreenJello>	and what if I want to pass an array?
<ezakimak>	not to a dom node directly, but to whatever you pair with it in your js models
*	robertmaxrees is now known as robertLunch
<ezakimak>	afaik the only way to preserve js types is via the data api, and only when accessing it via js, not as dom attributes
<kevireilly>	ezakimak: I believe you can by extending an existing element’s prototype for the custom element
<GreenJello>	until they provide a way to actually pass structured data, web components, etc. are pretty useless for things I do
<Torqable>	jrkie: just move the function
<ezakimak>	dom node prototypes are likely built-ins that you can't change
<ezakimak>	they are host objects
<GreenJello>	oh yeah, it works like html where you have *attributes* and you have *properties*
<GreenJello>	and they're two separate things
<kevireilly>	This is what got me started and shows how you can add the custom goodies http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/customelements/
<jrkie>	hello, i have a very basic question here, can someone help? i need to activate play when the document is loaded, it is now activated with a button: http://jsfiddle.net/5r02pf9u/ thanks in advance, i know only how it works with jquery
<GreenJello>	<input value="hello">, user changes the input to "bye", and inp.value === "bye", but inp.getAttribute('value') === 'hello'
<ezakimak>	getAttribute isn't live?
*	eighty4 is now known as pokk
<GreenJello>	ezakimak, the value attribute doesn't change when the user types
<ezakimak>	since when?
<GreenJello>	there's no reason it can't, but it doesn't
<ezakimak>	so the attribute is as it was when the node was first parsed/added to the dom?
<ezakimak>	eg, the default
<ezakimak>	could be handy
<EllisTAA>	i thought constructors were how we created inheritnce, but ppl say it is through prototypes. what is the difference between a constructor and a prototype?
<javascript961>	Hi, I was wondering if I could get some help with a userscript I'm writing. I want to remove <wbr> elements from the page before doing some other stuff to it but the removal of the elements causes the script to fail when it tries to access nodes that no longer exist. I've since tried putting the second function in a callback and even a simple delay but the issue persists. (code: http://pastebin.com/QSsVP1re, testpage:ht
<kevireilly>	my first test was a representation of a collection of items that you can add, remove, and so forth by a simple approach like document.getElementById(‘collection’).addItemAtIndex(3, { foo: ‘bar’ });
<ezakimak>	they are related--two mechanism that can be used together
<GreenJello>	EllisTAA, constructors have a prototype property, when you call a function with `new` it creates an object with the prototype set to Constructor.prototype, and then calls Constructor with `this` set to the new object
<GreenJello>	constructors are the most common way to achieve prototypical inheritance in js
<EllisTAA>	greenjello: when would i use constructors and when would i not?
<GreenJello>	you could also just do var obj = Object.create(proto); to create an object with the prototype proto
<ezakimak>	it's critical to point out that in JS every object has an internal [[prototype]], and that *constructors* in addition have a "prototype" property, which is used as the template for new objects internal [[prototype]] when using "new"
<ezakimak>	it's confusing at first w/o distinguishing the two
<ezakimak>	eg, whatever Foo's "prototype" points to when calling new Foo() is what the new object's internal [[prototype]] is set to
<GreenJello>	EllisTAA, I dunno, I don't use them often, it's usually only something seen in libraries or for integrating with libraries, and they'll tell you when to use it
<beaky>	are there better ways to process js lists than [].reduce
<ezakimak>	Foo's "prototype" is *not* the same as Foo's internal [[prototype]] (which is actually Function.prototype)
<EllisTAA>	greenjello: ty
<GreenJello>	EllisTAA, if you come from other languages where inheritance is the way to get things done, it's a bit less important in js
<GreenJello>	beaky, [].map, [].some, [].otherStuff?
<lynx__>	Hello, Could anyone help me with this: http://jsbin.com/vuwoqecore/1/edit?html,js,output I am trying to get a text box to show up when "Other" is selected, but I cannot see why it is not working.
<GreenJello>	!mdn array.prototype @ beaky
<ecmabot>	beaky: Array.prototype - JavaScript | MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/prototype>
<asteele>	lynx__ your next step should be to debug the value you are working with so you arent running blind, so a simple console.log($( "#animal-select option:selected" ).val()); before your if check, within the on change handler, should give you some insight to whats going wrong
<mmmveggies>	for router from express in es6, is it `import { Router } from 'express'; ?
*	skwak2 is now known as skwak
<beaky>	but map is just .reduce where u do [f(a)]+b
<GreenJello>	lynx__, you have display:none in the input you're adding
<ljharb>	beaky: .push, but yes, that's right
<GreenJello>	lynx__, also it's not going to appear to fade out because you set the html to "", so it does fade out, but it's fading out nothing
<ljharb>	beaky: but "map" means "change 1 array to another". it's clearer than reduce if that's what you mean.
<GreenJello>	mmmveggies, yep
<GreenJello>	at least with babel's implementation
<GreenJello>	(es6 import is implementation specific, and e.g. babel provides several implementations)
<NBhosting>	how do i return this to the original position http://fiddle.jshell.net/  demo: http://93.158.222.150/backgammon/25/

<lynx__>	asteele: Thanks for the tip. I have been inspecting it in the debugger, and now again with a console log, and it's value is "other", which is why i am confused
<lynx__>	GreenJello: the display:none is intentional so that the fadeIn works
<lynx__>	and the fade out should be sequentially first to the html("") call so it should work

<javascript961>	I take it noone is able to help me then?
<garbagegod>	Can anyone suggest a way to mitigate having duplicate code in a situation like this: http://hastebin.com/ixehuyonix.js
<ljharb>	javascript961: that's more of a #jquery question. also, please make a jsfiddle, not a pastebin
<garbagegod>	Without creating a new function for it
<ljharb>	garbagegod: put the duplicate code in a separate function that's defined above the "if" and call it in either branch.
<ljharb>	"creating a new function" is both the only, and the best, way to reuse code.
<ljharb>	(in JS)
<garbagegod>	ljharb: fair enough
<garbagegod>	thanks
<Torqable>	ljharb: labels, bro
<ljharb>	Torqable: please don't call me "bro". and that isn't reusing code, that's just GOTO.
<ljharb>	and it won't work in that particular case, where it's an async callback versus sync code
<ljharb>	which also is bad news bears anyways (mixing sync and async)
<Torqable>	goto does allow you to reuse code though
<ljharb>	fair.
<ljharb>	so does eval and strings. but that doesn't mean it counts.
<adavia>	is this fine? var expiration = new Date(new Date().getTime() + 3600000);
<Torqable>	how does it not count
<ljharb>	cause it's horrible
<Torqable>	just cus you shouldn't do something doesn't mean you can't ;P
<ljharb>	adavia: sure. i'd put `60 * 60e3` tho so it's clear it's an hour
<ljharb>	adavia: also Date.now() not `new Date().getTime()`
<adavia>	ljharb: you mean new Date(Date.now() + 3600000);
<ljharb>	adavia: new Date(Date.now() + 60*60e3) yes

<adavia>	ljharb:  why 60*60e3
<Havvy>	adavia:  60e3 = 1 minute.  60*60e3 = 1 hour.
<ljharb>	adavia: because it means "60 times 60 times 1000" which makes it easy to see that it's an hour? 60e3 is a minute, 60 * that is an hour
<ljharb>	24*60*60e3 is a day, etc
<adavia>	i was lost with the e3 part
<ljharb>	adavia: that's scientific notation. short for "* 1000"

<jhoffmcd>	i need to preload just images, a technique?
<adavia>	ljharb: so if i need lets say the current date and time then new Date(new Date().getTime()) would make sense now?
<ljharb>	jhoffmcd: var i = new Image(); i.src = url;
<jhoffmcd>	any techniques, I mean :)
<jhoffmcd>	okay cool i saw that one
<ljharb>	adavia: no, `new Date()` is now, as is `Date.now()` the timestamp for now.
<ljharb>	adavia: don't use `new Date().getTime()` at all.
<jhoffmcd>	ljharb: And i can expand upon that and use that concept in a preloader, etc
<ljharb>	jhoffmcd: yep
<jhoffmcd>	how would i know when the image has 'mounted' so to speak
<adavia>	ljharb: alright thanks
<ljharb>	jhoffmcd: i.addEventListener('load', callback)
<ljharb>	jhoffmcd: before you set the src.
<jhoffmcd>	ljharb: cool makes sense! thanks!
<bprompt>	jhoffmcd:     image objects also have a .complete boolean... so you could check    if (i[25].complete) {....

<jaawerth>	also they're still using null as csp.CLOSED. Which seems kinda silly when you've already bothered to create a csp.CLOSED value, and then still go ahead and make it null instead of an arbitrary object

<owen1>	i need to refactor angular.js app. it makes http call via a service and i am thinking of using a simple js function that i can require (with browserify) instead of angular service. does it sounds like a good idea?
<owen1>	(the app already uses browserify)
<owen1>	another question that is related. i want to memoize this function so after the first call it will save it the response from the server and future calls to the function will read from the memory. want's the best place to store that? localStorage or Window object?
<KonKalid>	I have no idea about angular but the same thing is done through caching the ajax request - response through jQuery
<owen1>	KonKalid: where would i keep that 'state'?
<pi->	This might not be the best channel for this question, but here goes: I've written game-logic in Python that I want to reside on the server. I want my client side js to request that the Python/server shuffles the deck, and then individually request each card one at a time.  How do I go about doing this?
*	lanceball is now known as lance|afk
<pi->	(it's an analogy, it's not actually decks and cards, it's chords of musical notes. But I don't want to complicate)
<jaawerth>	owen1: for "memoizing", you can use $cacheFactory to create a cache specifically for those calls you want to "memoize" (it works the same way $templateCache works, which is merely a cache automatically instantiated from $cacheFactory)
<jaawerth>	owen1: once you've created your custom cache (which would live in its own factory/service), you can simply inject where you need it and do $http.whatever(url, { cache: $myCustomCache })
<KonKalid>	I was talking about http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ (go to cach) ... But If that was app scope I would made a class with the send parameters as the options and a singleton pattern to have only one instance for each options. Then I would call a get ... something method and if the response was already there for the request options it would provide me those else would make the request and save the new instance... (something like a facto
<KonKalid>	ry)
<owen1>	jaawerth: thanks! do u know if there is a way to cache it without relaying on angular or jquery?
<owen1>	i would like to rely on javascript the language as much as possible and not on an external library.
<Torqable>	guh
<Torqable>	why is there not a concatMap

<beaky>	is it bad to use third party cdns for js scripts
<beaky>	will i get pwned by xss one day
<Havvy>	beaky:  It's not the XSS attacks that you're thinking of, but it is possible the remote CDN gets hacked and the file replaced with something that injects its own script.
<KonKalid>	a simple example owen1 I just wrote
<KonKalid>	http://pastebin.com/dcL0TvyQ
<KonKalid>	I wrote it know and is only to give you the general idea of a factory in JavaScript ... I haven't tested it ... (it may not work ... I don't know ;) )
<owen1>	KonKalid: thanks!
<owen1>	KonKalid: i'll try to refactor your code so i don't use the 'new' and 'this' keywords.
<KonKalid>	as you wish ... but what don't you like about "new" and "this" ?
<owen1>	i decided to avoid using them if possible since they require more thinking and can lead to errors.
<ljharb>	KonKalid: shared mutable state is poison
<ljharb>	inheritance is rarely the best way to organize code.
<owen1>	KonKalid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSGEjv3Tqo0&feature=youtu.be  Douglas Crockford decided to stop using 'this' as well.
<KonKalid>	(a correction in my pastbin ... in final line it is callFactory and not callFactorey ;) ;) )
<owen1>	yup
<KonKalid>	I will watch it but "this" and "new" is what makes sense to JavaScript to me ... (and yes I think that inheritance is a great thing) ... imo ;) ;)

<owen1>	if anyone can refactor KonKalid's code and remove 'factory', 'this', and 'new', please let me know!
<Sorella>	People really try using inheritance for code reuse, but it's a pretty bad tool for that.
<KonKalid>	it is not really from Java (yes that is where the title is) ... but it is there many many years ago
<KonKalid>	I decided to write JS that way from my IDE ... that way my IDE understand what I am doing and helps me ;) ;) ;)
<Torqable>	java is to car as javascript is to carpet

<KonKalid>	hehehehhe I don't compare languages that way , for me JS has a slight different approach of OOP (prototypes) then any other OOP language I know (yet)

<Sorella>	KonKalid: very few languages use prototypes. The only mainstream ones are JS and Lua. All the others (Self, Io, Ioke, Slate, NewtonScript, Mermaid, etc) are either academic or obscure language experiments

<noahmg123>	ljharb. bprompt. OK. All I want to do it take the XML, put it in a string, use some js I found online to convert it to json, the parse it from there.
<Torqable>	...
<ljharb>	noahmg123: ajax is the only possible way to make a network call from the browser.
<ljharb>	noahmg123: also you simply can't just "convert xml to json"
<bprompt>	hmmm
<ljharb>	xml has a more complex structure, so you'd need an xlst or schema or something to be able to do that.
<bprompt>	noahmg123:      you may be able to just get an xml -> json converter online, if is a one-time deal
<ljharb>	also why would you do that in the browser? do that on the server.
<bprompt>	yeah
<noahmg123>	Arrrgh! It's confusing talking to two people at once! :) :P OK, just a moment.
<bprompt>	well... we're all really saying/pointing the same thing
<ljharb>	xml doesn't necessarily easily/smoothly translate to json.
<noahmg123>	OK. I am using the WolframAlpha API. It outputs XML. I just want to use javascript to grab the data withing the XML tags.
<noahmg123>	Preferably by converting to JSON first.
<ljharb>	pretty certain wolfram alpha outputs json directly.
<ljharb>	if not that's very crappy and surprising
<ljharb>	noahmg123: at any rate, if it's in xml, you should work with it as xml, which the browser will parse into a tree for you
<tds5016>	hi all. Can someone tell me if there is a finally or something of the sort for javascript promises?
<Torqable>	don't think there is
<tds5016>	it's really annoying needing to repeat this code :-)
<ljharb>	tds5016: yes, of course?
<Torqable>	is there?
<ljharb>	tds5016: it's part of ES6, and there's been shims for literally years.
<noahmg123>	ljharb: OK. But this in the BG for an app. It will put all the data into variables, and these variables will be used by the app.
<ljharb>	ohhh "finally"
<Torqable>	thought you had the just .then(succesHandler, failHandler)
<ljharb>	tds5016: .then(foo, foo)
<ljharb>	right
<ljharb>	or .then(foo).catch(foo)
<ljharb>	it's not that much code to repeat
<Torqable>	agreed
<ljharb>	noahmg123: ok, so?
*	oddskill_afk is now known as oddskill_away
<ljharb>	noahmg123: it's still ajax, and you'd still work with it as an object from the xml
<tds5016>	ljharb: but then I have code that is used by both then and catch?
<ljharb>	tds5016: so?
<bprompt>	noahmg123:     js can "grab" the data of the xml tags, you'd just need to traverse the xml tree nodes for that, with document.getElementsByTagName()     downwards
<ljharb>	tds5016: .then(foo, foo) can't possibly run foo twice
<noahmg123>	bprompt: OK, but can't I just use that to grab the whole tree?
<tds5016>	ljharb: oh!!!! I get it... foo, foo would be the same method, but it would check for the failure?
<bprompt>	noahmg123:    sure, so long you traverse it, yes.. if you just want the ... .markup.. you could grab the "root" node's .innerHTML property then
<ljharb>	tds5016: .then(a, b) - the "a" runs if it succeeds, the "b" runs if it fails. "finally/always" semantics are ".then(a, a)" where no matter whether it succeeds or fails, it runs "a"
<bprompt>	noahmg123:   well.. .outerHTML will include the root node as well
<noahmg123>	bprompt: ok. I'll look into that. But Chrome adds it's own tags too so...
<tds5016>	ljharb: that isn't exactly what I'm looking for.
<tds5016>	I want to do different things in response to success and failure.
<ljharb>	tds5016: i'm pretty sure it is. maybe explain what you're looking for in more detail?
<tds5016>	but only some things are different.
<bprompt>	noahmg123:     well. chrome doesn't add tags per se, you may be looking at some custom elements I'd think in the site
<ljharb>	"finally" in "try/catch" means "no matter whether there's an exception or not, run this block of code"
<ljharb>	if you want something different, the word isn't "finally" :-)
<noahmg123>	bprompt: yeah. I'm looking into AJAX. It might work
<tds5016>	soo...  this.model.fetch().then(function() {console.log(foo); then do 30 other things... return next promise for chain}).catch(function() {console.log(bar); then do 30 other things... return next promise for chain});
<bprompt>	noahmg123:     XMLHttpRequest() object has...  .responseText   which gives the raw string, and .responseXML which gives you the node tree to traverse, for an xml file
<tds5016>	where I could move the 30 other things and returning the next promise for the chain.
<ljharb>	tds5016: right, so if that function is called "foo", you want `.then(foo, foo)`
<ljharb>	tds5016: by doing .then and .catch, any failure/rejection in the .then will end up triggering the .catch
<ljharb>	tds5016: and if you want to know if it's a success or a failure, either you use a wrapper function, or, you never reject with anything but an error, and use `instanceof Error` on the value.
<tds5016>	ljharb: but the try and catch aren't doing the same thing.
<tds5016>	they just share some of the code.
<ljharb>	tds5016: in your example, you'd have .then(function (val) { console.log('foo'); return doOtherThings(val); }, function (err) { console.log('bar'); return doOtherThings(err); })
<ljharb>	tds5016: and "doOtherThings" is the shared code.
<ljharb>	ie, split that up into smaller functions.
<tds5016>	yeah, I mean that's the work around I technically have now...
<noahmg123>	bprompt: Yeah. I think I will still convert to JSON so I can have cleaner code.
<tds5016>	but if we had a finally it'd be a nicer solution imho.
<ljharb>	tds5016: that's not a workaround, that's the nicest solution.
<ljharb>	making lots of tiny functions is ideal.
<bprompt>	noahmg123:    as ljharb  suggested though, you may want to have the webserver, do the request to wolframalpha site, get the xml and parse it to json, then serve it up to the page you need it at, since most server languages will have an xml -> json subroutine already
<tds5016>	nicest imho would be for this .then(function() {thenCode}).catch(function(){'catch code'}) .finally(function() {shared code});
<tds5016>	:-)
<tds5016>	but bot certainly work.
<tds5016>	both*
<noahmg123>	bprompt: OK. I just have a small budget (of about $0) for this project. :)P And I want this to be as simple as possible.
<tds5016>	one other question...
<bprompt>	one could say, 0 is more then nil, or null or undefined  =)
<tds5016>	can promises be caught in two places?
<noahmg123>	bprompt: how do I set the request URL?
<tds5016>	or only one then per promise?
<Havvy>	tds5016:  Yes.
<noahmg123>	bprompt: for the ajax function.
<tds5016>	Havvy: so I can catch the same promise twice ?
<tds5016>	if so; awesome :-D
<bprompt>	noahmg123:     may want to check at #perl or #php   but pretty sure you'd end up doing a curl() call
<noahmg123>	bprompt: OK.
<noahmg123>	I'm gonna hop out and rest my brain real quick after all that. :)

<ciwolsey>	If I have a deep object like.. a.b.c.d.e.f and i want to print the value at f, but I'm not sure if a, b, c, d or e exist.. is there a way to do that which doesnt generate errors without having to check each level?
<ciwolsey>	this might explain better: https://gist.github.com/ciwolsey/02b2eeb2f9c2b930e23c
<boar>	ciwolsey: If there is a way I'll be super interested in knowing how
<ciwolsey>	having to check systematically at each level seems.. crazy
<asteele>	if (typeof a.b.d.e.f !==' undefined') ?
<asteele>	minus obvious syntax errors lol
<boar>	asteele: Doesn't that throw an error?
<ciwolsey>	yes it does
<asteele>	o
<boar>	ciwolsey: Just curious, why are you using '!!' instead of just leaving it?
<ciwolsey>	honestly not really sure
<ciwolsey>	but its the same issue with or without the !!
<Torqable>	no you pretty much have to if(a && a.b && a.b.c & a.b.c.d)
<boar>	Yeah, was just curious. imo use (typeof x.y.z === 'undefined') instead, that way values with 0 or null are true
<ciwolsey>	ah ok
<Torqable>	not sure why you would want that
<boar>	sorry, != 'undefined'
<ciwolsey>	alright
<Torqable>	if you get true on null for b you'll move on to c and get undefined error
<ciwolsey>	yeah i just wondered if there was a trick or something
<ciwolsey>	but i guess not
<Sorella>	!g delve site:npmjs.org @ ciwolsey
<ecmabot>	ciwolsey: delve - npm <https://npmjs.org/package/delve>
<Sorella>	ciwolsey: though I'd say your data structure is WRONG.
<boar>	If you want the check to be more automated you could do a looping check based off a string
<Sorella>	ciwolsey: why do you have all of those null values ther?
<ciwolsey>	null values?
<ciwolsey>	you mean i should probably set default values in the db?
<Sorella>	ciwolsey: Meteor().user.pendingData should *always* return data of the type you expect (object/array), not null or undefined.
<Sorella>	Normalising your data structure will avoid all of that madness
<Sorella>	s/madness/awfulness/
<tds5016>	did I metnion turbo links is the devil? lol. for some reason hitting back allows my backbone router to fire, but it does however not load the dom before sending the ready event. I'm not exactly sure how tor remedy that.
<ciwolsey>	Sorella, hmm ok, thanks
<emma>	Do you guys know how installing with npm works?  If I install something with npm will it be available to all users on the machine or must I install separate copies for both people?
<Sorella>	emma: `npm install foo` will download `foo` and all of its dependencies, and place it on the closest `node_modules` folder from the current working directory, creating a new one in the cwd if none exists
<Sorella>	That's all it does
<Sorella>	Oh, if you pass the --global flag, then it'll install on the place npm stores its libraries, which depends on how you've installed npm
<emma>	i installed npm with sudo apt-get on an Ubuntu server
<emma>	so it sounds like --global is best?
<Sorella>	emma: npm install foo and npm install --global foo are used for entirely different purposes. The first is for installing dependencies in your JS projects, the latter is for installing command line applications and things like that.
<Sorella>	(that are not dependencies in your project)
<ljharb>	emma: you should install packages locally per-project
<ljharb>	emma: and you should NOT use apt to install node/npm
<ljharb>	emma: each project should have its own distinct copy of any dependencies it has.
<Sorella>	Well, it's not like you have a choice when working with npm :P
<Sorella>	You either install things per-project, or they don't work
<ljharb>	true :-)
<Havvy>	Sorella:  You could always throw things into /node_modules/package-name  where "/" is the root of the filesystem.
<Sorella>	Ah, yes =/
<zeroquake>	Any tips on understanding code which uses closures (not sure of right word) at multiple levels
<boar>	zeroquake: Do you have an example of what you're talking about?
<zeroquake>	umm , will make a fiddle example..
<jarek>	Hi
<jarek>	Is there a library that would allow me to adjust the indentation of HTML and SVG document fragments?
<Sorella>	jarek: not sure what you mean by that
<theseb>	setTimeout is great but what if you need to capture *return value* of function?
<theseb>	from what i know setTimeout works for a function with no args and no return vals
<emma>	ljharb: oh wow. i already used apt to instal node/npm. What do I do now?
<emma>	and what do I do instead?
<jarek>	Sorella: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d540aa0b838f66eac7d7
<jarek>	Sorella: I want to adjust the whitespace so that the output string can be easily read and edited
<Sorella>	jarek: most text editors will be able to do that
<jarek>	Sorella: yeah, I need that functionality in my SVG editor
<Sorella>	emma: you could use nvm to install Node instead.
<jarek>	is there a text editor written in JS that can prettify HTML/SVG?
<Sorella>	jarek: if you're not using something like Chrome's DOM inspector, you can either write your own pretty printer, or use an existing library for that. If said existing library takes plain text, it'd be faster to write your own pretty printer using your tree format
*	Torkable is now known as Guest49365
<j201>	jarek: i'd be surprised if codemirror or a plugin for it didn't have auto-indentation
<Sorella>	Though writing a good XML pretty printer is kinda tricky. Wadler describes an algebraic one that supports prettier outputs here: http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/prettier/prettier.pdf, but there might be different algorithms that aren't based on algebras out there
<jarek>	j201: auto-indentation is not the same as prettification, the latter requires handling special cases such as elements with white-space: pre
<Sorella>	Guess you could come up with a more specific algorithm for XML though than that generic one
<Sorella>	jarek: you can't actually know which elements have white-space: pre though :P
<jarek>	Sorella: I managed to achieve good results with XSLT transforms, but I couldn't figure out how to prevent it from changing the whitespace in certain elements such as <text> or <tspans>
<jarek>	anyway, XSLT is probably going to be removed by browsers eventually
<jarek>	I recall Chrome team discussing it
<jarek>	Sorella: I can use getComputedStyle() in my scenario
<Sorella>	W... why would you use XSLT when you have a tree in JS?
<Sorella>	jarek: that doesn't give you CSS files that might be added later though
<jarek>	Sorella: with XSLT it took like 10 lines of code, though I don't really understand that code
<jarek>	I just borrowed it from stackoverflow
<jarek>	(Copy-Paste Driven Software Development™)
<jarek>	https://github.com/jonschlinkert/grunt-prettify/blob/master/tasks/prettify.js
<jarek>	those regular expressions are ridiculous
<Sorella>	jarek: simpler to do in JS: `function pretty(node){ return isTag(node)?  "<" + tag(node) + attrs(node) + ">" + node.children.map(pretty) + "</" + tag(node) + ">" : isString(node)? node : blowUp() }`
<Sorella>	It's just recursing over trees
<ljharb>	emma: uninstall it with apt, and use http://nvm.sh (or install it from source)
<Sorella>	It gets slightly trickier if you want to properly split attributes in lines if they go beyond a certain column and things like that. But overall, just recursing over the tree and adding the relevant indentations is enough
<jarek>	in HTML5, in order to check node type, should I use element.localName, element.tagName, element.nodeName?
<jarek>	I guess element.nodeName is the most universal one?
<lewis__>	--save-dev not working for npm install -g protractor --save-dev, any idea?
<lautan>	can't use -g with save-dev
<lewis__>	lautan: i see
<lewis__>	lautan: do we need the g with protractor? i assume yes/...ey
<lautan>	-g is for installing it globally
<lewis__>	i know
<lautan>	you probably want sudo npm install -g protractor
<lewis__>	what if you have a global package that is required that you want to include in your project package.json
<lewis__>	lautan: *
<lautan>	you shouldn't add global packages to package.json
<lewis__>	lautan: why not
<j201>	lewis__: if you want packages in package.json, you probably want to use the one in your node_modules instead of your global copy for building/testing
<lautan>	like protractor should have a package for package.json and one package for command line
<j201>	that way you keep your tools in sync with your project tool versions and others can set up the necessary tools just with `npm install`
<j201>	also, a tip: if you run npm scripts, they will add binaries you've installed locally with npm to your path
<j201>	so if you have npm install protractor, you can just use `protractor --foo --bar` in your npm scripts
<lewis__>	j201: right but in this case i dont want to have to type npm install specific_global_pack everytime, i rather include it in my project package.json if possible
<falafel>	that's the idea lewis__, if you run it in npm scripts it looks for it in your local packages
<lewis__>	falafel: j201, npm scripts?
<falafel>	lewis__, https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts
<[FreeLay]>	ecmabot (~ecmabot@boshi.inimino.org) has Joined ##javascript
<lewis__>	i see falafel thank you
<Sorella>	lewis__: that's not how npm works. npm has been DESIGNED such that only packages you install in your project are seen as dependencies of your project. npm knows no globals
<lewis__>	Sorella: falafel: j201: https://gist.github.com/6ewis/6c30bc34ef6968a45e16
<Sorella>	lewis__: That's not what npm scripts are for :)
<lewis__>	Sorella: oh crap --wishful thinging :(
<lewis__>	thinking*
<Sorella>	lewis__: and again, npm has been designed to require you to install all packages you're using in a project *for* that project, at that project's directory. It might seem annoying, but it avoids several problems that come from not doing that (aka freaking dependency hell and random breaking of packages when updating / installing something new)
<lewis__>	Sorella: what was script design for
<Sorella>	lewis__: routine shell commands that can be ran in a project. Like `"test"` would contain the shell command you should issue for testing your package, and so on, and so forth.
<lewis__>	Sorella: whats so wrong if i use if to install global packages
<Sorella>	So instead of running `compile *.js && cp *.js test && node test/index.js --pretty`, you can just run `npm run test`
<Havvy>	Global packages just install the binaries to your system.
<Sorella>	lewis__: nothing, that's just not going to do what you're expecting it to do.
<lewis__>	Sorella: ah it's so confusing
<Sorella>	lewis__: npm only has a --global flag for installing things like command line applications that are completely independent of any project. Since it won't look there for dependencies.
<Sorella>	lewis__: it's not confusing, just forget --global exists :P
<Sorella>	It's not for installing anything project-related
<lewis__>	Sorella: the script part is confusing - i thought it was mainly to run cmd on the cmd line pre-install, after install of the project packages
<Sorella>	lewis__: some of it is for that as well.
<lewis__>	j201: what did you mean by protractor --foo --bar
<b4b>	>> null == false
<ecmabot>	b4b: (boolean) false
<lewis__>	Sorella: hmm
<b4b>	how come?
<j201>	lewis__: if you do `npm install protractor` and want to run the copy of protractor you installed, you'd have to run something like `./node_modules/protractor/bin/protractor ...`, but in an npm script, you can just use `protractor ...` and it will run the binary you installed.
<b4b>	why doesnt null == true evaluate to true and when is the nvidia sheild tv console coming out?
<b4b>	null == false that is...
<lewis__>	j201: sorella sais that script is not meant for that https://gist.github.com/6ewis/6c30bc34ef6968a45e16
<Sorella>	lewis__: because it isn't. Installing packages globally on the user's system is not something your package should be doing on install (it won't have the privileges to do that anyway)
<lewis__>	Sorella: so what if i pass sudo
<Sorella>	lewis__: then everyone's going to ignore your package forever :)
<rogeruiz>	haha
<Sorella>	lewis__: (also, sudo isn't a thing in Windows).
<Sorella>	lewis__: in any case, just forget --global exists.
<lewis__>	Sorella: if it's already installed it wont install it again
<lewis__>	Sorella: people still use windows?
<Sorella>	*shrugs*
<lewis__>	Sorella: hmm maybe you're right - im just lazy
<lewis__>	Sorella: maybe i should write a bash script and link to the bash script
<DarkElement>	Guys my lcd is only displaying some lines on max brightness while running any of the hello world program and I am sure that my hardware is hooked up correctly, and I have tried changing the potentiometer but to no avail. Any ideas?

<Maxdamantus>	Heh.
<DarkElement>	Mistakes were made.
<j201>	lewis__: scripts aren't for installing packages, they're for running packages

<lewis__>	j201: i wanna use it to install global packages via scripts. pros vs cons?
<idafyaid>	Guys, how to I change tho body's class from "x" to "y" with JS?
<falafel>	!mdn classList @ idafyaid
<ecmabot>	idafyaid: Element.classList - Web API Interfaces | MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList>
<idafyaid>	Huh
<j201>	lewis__: cons: you won't have reliable control over what version of the tool you're using, your project's dependencies will be unclear, and you'll make global changes to your system and the systems of other devs
<j201>	lewis__: here's an example of what i mean: https://github.com/j201/butwithyodeling/blob/master/package.json
<j201>	so to get the project building, a dev just has to do `npm install && npm run build`
<idafyaid>	I just want to change <body class="noTouch noScroll"> into <body class="Touch Scroll">
<falafel>	idafyaid, read up the link I posted
<idafyaid>	Sure
<lewis__>	j201: so i was thinking about writing a script that check if the global packages are installed and if its not installed them via scripts property of package.json - it will be up to the user to run it
<falafel>	lewis__, why? local packages will have preference over global ones
<falafel>	npm will look locally first, then globally
<j201>	lewis__: why? what's wrong with the local approach?
<lewis__>	falafel: right, im talking about global packages that are used in a particular project
<lewis__>	j201: karma, protractor,....so many global packages that we use day to day on our project
<lewis__>	they dont have a package.json?
<j201>	lewis__: nothing makes a package a 'global package' other than how you install it
<lewis__>	j201: protractor
<j201>	karma can easily be used as a local package using the approach i've been describing
<j201>	lewis__: for example, https://github.com/angular/angular-seed uses karma and protractor locally
<lewis__>	j201: i love you man
<lewis__>	j201: thanks - i get it now
<idafyaid>	Damn, I use body.classList.remove("NoTouch NoScroll"); and it does not change it

<Nikesh>	falafel: Thanks for the feedback
<idafyaid>	falafel: Enlighten me
<forQuery>	i have a button that everytime i click it, it logs a message.   My goal is, i only want it to log the message the first time the button is clicked... then never again
<forQuery>	http://codepen.io/anon/pen/QbNyzN
<falafel>	idafyaid, try the things people have been saying, post a demo that we can reproduce
<Sorella>	Nikesh: if you're on 3g, definitely 1 JS :P If you're sending them over HTTP, definitely 1 JS too :P
<idafyaid>	Sure
*	Sorella just loves the latency in mobile networks
<Nikesh>	Sorella: Ah OK. So that it all loads consistently?
<Sorella>	Nikesh: it isn't about consistency, it's about the latency overhead introduced by multiple HTTP requests, which will make > 1 asset load *much* slower, even when they're the same size combined, because networks suck
<Nikesh>	Sorella: Ah, I see
*	Dorf_ is now known as Dorf
<khmer>	HTTP2 will be cool
<Sorella>	Yeah, HTTP2 fixes some of that
<idafyaid>	http://jsfiddle.net/fx9meec5/3/
<idafyaid>	falafel: How about now? :P
<Jumbotron>	just ate 5 burritos
<falafel>	idafyaid, nop, HTML is invalid, you have two bodies, the body alreadys comes with the fiddle, then what is `body` where is that defined? Did you mean `document.body`?
<idafyaid>	I don't want to post too much...
<idafyaid>	It's just a body structure
<idafyaid>	:P
<idafyaid>	On a website
<robertmaxrees>	idafyaid the issue is what little you're posting doesn't even work and is invalid.
<forQuery>	or, here is an even simpler example... if anyone knows how to make it only log the message on first click, not every click...
<falafel>	idafyaid, if you want to make the demo you'd have to add the classes to the body provided by the fiddle first, then remove them, that way you learn how classList works, which is what the question is about after all
<forQuery>	http://codepen.io/anon/pen/BNKjMy
<falafel>	forQuery, the hasClickedOnce has to be capture in a closure, if you declare it inside it it brand new everytime you the event handler is called
<forQuery>	thank you
<forQuery>	i undestand, i will try again
<Sorella>	forQuery: use an `once` higher order function?
<falafel>	yes^^
<forQuery>	http://codepen.io/anon/pen/GJZozb i just moved var hasClickedOnce = false higher, above first function and it worked
<forQuery>	http://codepen.io/anon/pen/GJZozb
<Sorella>	Where `function once(f){ return function(){ var result = f.apply(this, arguments); f = function(){}; return result }}`, or something similar.
<idafyaid>	falafel: The whole body is like 20000 lines of code... Sure that you want to have that much fun? :P
<robertmaxrees>	idafyaid that's not what they're saying.
<falafel>	idafyaid, I think you are not getting what we mean by "demo".
<idafyaid>	Perhaps. I am a very fine webdev noob
<falafel>	it basically means something that *we can reproduce*, as in we can run it and get some sort of error, or see what you are doing wrong, as-is, right now, the HTML is invalid, and the real body doesn't have any classes
<Sorella>	>> function once(f){ return function(){ var result = f.apply(this, arguments); f = function(){}; return result }}; var logOnce = once(function(x){ console.log(x) }); logOnce('Hey!'); logOnce('Halo!'); logOnce("'Sup!");
<ecmabot>	Sorella: undefined; Console: 'Hey!'
<falafel>	so it is not reproducible, that's the keyword
<forQuery>	thank you sorella, i will play with this way instead
<robertmaxrees>	idafyaid http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/37bt1kjb/ this is an example of a test case.
<falafel>	idafyaid, but so far I see one error. `body` doesn't exist, you want `document.body`
<idafyaid>	lol Still does not work
<robertmaxrees>	is it unemployed?
<idafyaid>	?
<robertmaxrees>	you said "Still does not work" - is it unemployed?
<idafyaid>	Oh, shit. A joke :P
<idafyaid>	Is there another channel for JS?
<sabrehagen>	looking for some nomenclature assistance. when designing a restful api you have structures like /users/userId/projects/projectId. users and projects are 'collections', what are userId and projectId? instances?
<robertmaxrees>	;) you're being vague.  being specific about what doesn't work is good.  what about it is broken?
<robertmaxrees>	any console errors?  etc.
<idafyaid>	No. It just does not change it
<falafel>	sabrehagen, documents?
<robertmaxrees>	idafyaid my fiddle works fine.
<theseb>	setTimeout is great but what if you need to capture *return value* of function?  from what i know setTimeout works for a function with no args and no return vals
<sabrehagen>	falafel: they're documents in the db, but not logically documents
<robertmaxrees>	idafyaid http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/37bt1kjb/ this is what you want.
<falafel>	sabrehagen, in "users/123/projects/456", I would call 123 a "user document", and 456 a "project document"
<robertmaxrees>	http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/37bt1kjb/1/ shows how to remove multiple classes.
<KonKalid>	@theseb what do want to do ?
<robertmaxrees>	and with that, i disappear.  enjoy folks.
<falafel>	but not sure that's the correct term, I guess it depends on the contest
<falafel>	*context
<sabrehagen>	falafel: what defines a document?
<theseb>	KonKalid: delay execution of a function...and capture its return value
<falafel>	sabrehagen, a URI?
<theseb>	KonKalid: JS has not blocking/sleeping so setTimeout is the only game in town i know of
<sabrehagen>	a document is a URI?
<KonKalid>	theseb think outside the box ... what exactly you want to do .. . @see setInterval
<Sorella>	sabrehagen: they're all some kind of resource.
<falafel>	"resource", that' might be a better words, yeah
<sabrehagen>	Sorella: i like resource the most so far
<KonKalid>	probably you want something to be performed with a returned value
<theseb>	KonKalid: after some number of seconds I want func to run
<Sorella>	Well, that's what REST calls them :)
<theseb>	KonKalid: man JS is sooo hard w/o sleep or blocking
<sabrehagen>	Sorella: great, thanks :)
<KonKalid>	so  setInterval  ... sleeping is not a good option in any language
<falafel>	Uniform Resource Identifier
<KonKalid>	it is not a socket ;) ;)
<Sorella>	theseb: it isn't, you just need to brush off your classes on recursion and CPS :P
<idafyaid>	LOL I made a typo
<idafyaid>	Sorry guys
<theseb>	KonKalid: aha! but setInterval insists on funcs with NO args and NO returns!!!
<idafyaid>	Gonna try it now
<idafyaid>	lol
<idafyaid>	I am tired :/
<KonKalid>	that is not true
<KonKalid>	@theseb should I write an example ?
<Sorella>	theseb: functions are forbidden of returning things in CPS. But you can still pass arguments to them, and "return" values.
<KonKalid>	lets google it to find something ready
<Sorella>	>> function add(a, b, Return){ Return(a + b) }; add(1, 2, print)
<ecmabot>	Sorella: undefined; Console: 3
<falafel>	theseb, `log(add(1, 2))` vs `add(1, 2, log)`
<idafyaid>	It works. Damn, I need to sleep. robermaxrees, falafel: Thank you!
<idafyaid>	robertmaxrees
<Sorella>	The only difference is that, instead of implicitly running your script line-by-line, you're telling the functions where they should pass control to once they're done. It's a more explicit style, sure, but not that hard.
<Side_FX>	Why is #javascript invite only ?
<Havvy>	Side_FX:  Because it's not a real channel.
<Sorella>	Side_FX: #javascript doesn't exist. # names are reserved for official channels, and the only ones who have the rights to #javascript are Oracle (and Mozilla I guess)
<Havvy>	Of which Oracle would never do that and Mozilla has their own network.
<Side_FX>	Oh... This is my first time on this network.  This seems to be way better than efnet
<KonKalid>	I found this one http://wallofscribbles.com/2011/setinterval-the-sneaky-basterd-child-of-javascript/ ... it is not the bes but is better to write code at this time ...;) ;)
<Sorella>	Not familiar with efnet, but Freenode seems to be relatively well organised overall.
<jaawerth>	efnet is more, uh, oldschool internet techies IIRC
<jaawerth>	plenty of good channels but a little less warm and fuzzy, I think
<buu>	efnet is piracy and grognards
<Side_FX>	Perhaps :)  I've been using it since '95 and never really ventured on other networks...
<jaawerth>	yes, grognards is the word ;-)
<jaawerth>	no judgments though, one of my co-workers is a longtime fan and I've been on there a bit here and there
<Side_FX>	It was thriving back in the day but people are turning away from it seems more and more
<Sorella>	TIL grognard.
*	Sorella refuses to be called that just for preferring D&D 3.5 tho
<Havvy>	DnD 3.5e best edition.
<Side_FX>	Had to urbandictionary that one...
<Sorella>	Havvy: it is :D
<Havvy>	4e was written from the perspective that players are computers that can keep track of lots of +1s and 5e is even more unbalanced than 3.5e.
<Side_FX>	SO this network is more developer-centric?
<Havvy>	Side_FX:  Yes.
<Sorella>	Though most of the times when I'm DM'ing we don't use many rules, and when we tried playing the 4th edition it ended up being mostly roleplaying with some very simple combat rules and lots of fairness-thingies.
<jaawerth>	it's a pretty heavy network for all sorts of techie stuff, pretty strong in the open source department too
<jaawerth>	not just devs, I'd say, though it's pretty dev-strong (heh0
<Sorella>	(Though I think it's more fun that way :P)
<Maxdamantus>	Oh hey, use a newer version of node → program runs pretty much as fast as the C equivalent with gcc/clang.
<Sorella>	Maxdamantus: but does it run like that twice in a row? :P
<Maxdamantus>	Yes.
<Sorella>	Maxdamantus: it's too simple then :3
<Maxdamantus>	Dunno.
<KonKalid>	I strongly believe that node thing should be dead .. we have Web Sockets ... (sorry) ...
<Maxdamantus>	It involves prime factorisation of about 100k numbers up to 1b
*	robotmayo is now known as zz_robotmayo
<jaawerth>	Maxdamantus: sounds right - that's the kind of procedure where you could really take advantage of JIT magic
<Maxdamantus>	I'm wondering how it's representing the numbers.
<Maxdamantus>	does it use 64-bit integers sometimes?
<jaawerth>	well that's how all js numbers are stored IIRC, though I'm sure v8 itself does more with it
<Maxdamantus>	I'm storing the first 10k or so primes in a normal array .. in previous versions of node, it seemed to be slightly slower to use something like Int32Array
<Havvy>	jaawerth:  All numbers are 64 bit floats.
<jaawerth>	yeah, isn't that what I said? just more wishy-washy?
<Havvy>	jaawerth:  No, you said integers.
<jaawerth>	I said "Numbers"
<jaawerth>	:P
<jaawerth>	okay technically I said "numbers"
<Havvy>	You said in response to "64 bit integers".
<Sorella>	v8 tries to keep them as integers as long as they don't overflow int32
<Sorella>	IIRC
<jaawerth>	<jaawerth> well that's how all js numbers are stored IIRC, though I'm sure v8 itself does more with it
<Sorella>	And if the array can be statically inferred, v8 will probably try allocating that much of memory as a contiguous segment
<jaawerth>	Sorella: yeahh that's what I thought, vaguely remembered something about internal types in there
<jaawerth>	Maxdamantus: are you using any particular factorization method?
<kevireilly>	Is anyone familiar with reflow aka layouts and when they might take place? Guessing there isn’t a universal answer as it may be browser dependent, but does a reflow only occur after javascript relinquishes control?
<Maxdamantus>	jaawerth: for(var p = 0; (num = prime(p)) <= sqrtn; p++){ var exp = 0; while(n%num === 0){ n /= num; exp++; } .. }
<sabrehagen>	Sorella: what's your experience with c++?
<Sorella>	sabrehagen: almost none :D
<jaawerth>	Maxdamantus: ah, so more or less trial division. if you want to speed it up more, I'd use Pollard's rho algorithm (pretty easy to implement) and the Miller-Rabin primality test ;-)
*	Maxdamantus doesn't know about those.
<Sorella>	kevireilly: no, reflows occur when the browser needs to compute things so they can give your JS answers about the layout as it is now. E.g.: when you do `a.clientWidth`, the browser has to recompute the whole layout to give you that answer.
<Sorella>	They also happen when you add new elements to the document and relinquish control, if you haven't accessed any of such properties in the mean time
<kevireilly>	Sorella: ah that one totally makes sense to give you the most up to date version of geometric dimensions, but what about appending a child to the DOM as an example
<kevireilly>	I’m seeing that indeed it does vary but that generally “browsers are smart” and will attempt to queue multiple changes and wont necessarily append a child, change a style, and what not on the spot
<Sorella>	kevireilly: they're usually batched, but the browser might decide to do a reflow between those operations as well. It's better to use a document fragment instead
<kevireilly>	Sorella: agreed and is something I have been lookign into
<kevireilly>	having done javascript for awhile with a DOM has been an interesting transition to concepts like this ;) fun though
<kevireilly>	*without a DOM
<jaawerth>	Maxdamantus: http://userpages.umbc.edu/~rcampbel/NumbThy/Class/Programming/JavaScript/
<psYbR>	hiyo o/ Anyone able to tell my why a snippet of html followed by some js wrapped in <script> isn't executing? It works fine if i put it in the body of the document but echo'd from PHP the JS doesn't seem to work
<jaawerth>	Maxdamantus: it's not too bad to implement in any language with a reference but there's some javascript methods for a bunch of number theory tricks (including Pollard's rho method)
<psYbR>	http://pastebin.com/vAHqzTu5
<kevireilly>	What is the potential reasoning behind el.appendChild(elem.cloneNode(true));?
<Obbs>	psYbR: have you checked for unclosed tags/statements? Can you share more?
<kevireilly>	Sorella: thanks for the feedback btw and interesting article on templating engines
<kevireilly>	el.appendChild(elem.cloneNode(true)) versus el.appendChild(elem)
<rcyr>	kevireilly: That person wanted a copy?
<psYbR>	sure Obbs, that exact code works fine when not echo'd from php though. does echoing elements from php assign element id's differently or something?
<rcyr>	Isn't it obvious?
<kevireilly>	rcyr: what is the benefit of appending a clone versus the original?
<Obbs>	nope
<rcyr>	kevireilly: How else would you do a copy of a node without cloning it?
<Obbs>	php is server side, it will figure out what to send before it sends it
<anth0ny_>	When is it better to use Chai for tests and when is it better to use Tape? Anyone have opinions on which I should use for a webapp (that doesn’t use browserify)?
<psYbR>	adding a console.log('test'); to that script successfully outputs to console, but puzzled
<kevireilly>	rcyr: why would I want a copy? There is quite possibly something fundamental here I’m not grasping
<rcyr>	kevireilly: I can't guess it with that line alone.
<psYbR>	console.log( $('the element's Id') ); produces valid output too, i'm confuzzled
<kevireilly>	rcyr: saw it here, curious why resig does it http://ejohn.org/blog/dom-documentfragments/
<kevireilly>	ah, it may have been because he was intentionally duplicating the same line
<Obbs>	psYbR: with that php code, what is output at that point in the doc?
<kevireilly>	so that probably isn’t something you’d do in practice unless you were literally duplicating things intentionally
<psYbR>	Obbs, this is my view source result: http://pastebin.com/cdRFftBQ
<rcyr>	kevireilly: He's cloning the nodes so he can reuse his "elems" array
<rcyr>	kevireilly: Without the clone, it would move the elements from a container to another
<kevireilly>	rcyr: totally should have re-read this article before asking, makes sense now
<rcyr>	kevireilly: That's totally cool :)
<psYbR>	Obbs, even putting the js in a function in the <head> and calling it from the echo'd code doesn't work :(
*	welly[work] is now known as welly[work][away
<kevireilly>	thanks for tolerating me rcyr ;)
<rcyr>	kevireilly: You're very welcome
<kevireilly>	psYbR: unlikely the problem, but should probably add `type=“text/javascript”` to your script tags
<kevireilly>	any errors in the console?
<psYbR>	ok... interesting. It doesn't work once it's inside a div
<psYbR>	the div breaks it
<KonKalid>	debug it
<kevireilly>	also not the problem but is a good practice, the <hr> and <input …> elements should be self closed <hr /> <input … />
<kevireilly>	<!DOCTYPE html> at the top would be a good idea too
<kevireilly>	<link … />
<psYbR>	okay... adding margins to the div style is what's breaking it specifically, if I remove them it works. weird.
<kevireilly>	psYbR: shouldn’t unless you’re not being careful about single versus double quotes
<kevireilly>	worst case scenario it should just make that CSS declaration not work
<psYbR>	okay... had to comment out "left = left - width + field.offsetWidth;" in the .js I was including. Seems to be a bug with it, it was working but appearing outside the viewport
<psYbR>	who knows what else that's broken
<psYbR>	thanks for your help :)

<zpartw>	I'm trying to (via cURL and PHP) figure out if a given YouTube video has been deleted. YouTube sends 200 OK as return code no matter if the video exists or not (even for the embed thing), and it has the same <h1> saying that the video is gone even for videos that are not gone. They are somehow hiding that by default and only showing it if the video is gone, but they can't be using JavaScript because I've tried it without JS
<zpartw>	turned on and it correctly shows that message only for deleted videos. Here is an example of a nonexistent video page: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdSpxq4iTGk
<zpartw>	Can anyone in here help me figure out how they are doing this? It's almost as if they are deliberately making it hard to check this for some reason. It seems technically impossible, yet it happens.

<jaawerth>	dumb question - will the Error constructor double-wrap an error thath's already an instance of Error? it isn't documented, but trying it seems to detect when an error is already passed in
<jaawerth>	I suppose it's best to use an is-error method anyway just in case there's a custom error type that may be overwritten
*	Mmango is now known as AggressiveCactus
<Sorella>	jaawerth: http://es5.github.io/#x15.11.1.1
<Sorella>	It's basically doing String(x)
*	hmsimha__ is now known as hmsimha
<jaawerth>	yeah that's what I thought...
<jaawerth>	hmm
<Sorella>	>> String(Error(Error("foo")))
<ecmabot>	Sorella: (string) 'Error: Error: foo'
<jaawerth>	basically I'm writing a fromPromise method for js-csp, and trying to determine the best method for passing on the .catch result
<jaawerth>	I need to wrap it in *something* so it being a rejection is detectable. at first I was thinking an error, since normally a rejection won't necessarily be an error. but then if it's already an error it'll b e overwritten, and sometimes you may want to reject a promise without it necessarily being an error..
<jaawerth>	which sadly means writing a custom handler but I was of course hoping to avoid that
<Sorella>	I'd particularly use sum types for that `union IOFailure { OhGodWereFucked(reason), FileExists(pathname), ... }`
<jaawerth>	that makes sense, but it's less universal if it requires custom handling.. then again, I need to implement my own upstream error handling anyway since the library doesn't really have that yet
<jaawerth>	which I suppose just means it isn't quite ready for prime time
<jaawerth>	something like var item = yield chan; csp.isError(item, doSomething)
<jaawerth>	would be ideal
<Sorella>	var [error, item] = yield chan;?
<jaawerth>	or that, yeah
<jaawerth>	but then you need to make all channels yield that format and they currently don't
<Sorella>	True.
<Sorella>	Composing that is also awkward
<jaawerth>	yep
<jaawerth>	it makes sense for it to remain a single value anyway, though, since that gives you the option to handle the error there or continue passing it downstream
<jaawerth>	though if you try to transduce it it'd break anyway
<Sorella>	I particularly like the monadic way, where you've got `chan.then(f).then(g).then(h).orElse(...)`, but has its own problems in JS
<jaawerth>	yeah, plus then you're basically back to a CPS approach
<Sorella>	jaawerth: works when you have do notation though :P
<jaawerth>	true
<jaawerth>	a custom rejection wrapper/unwrapper would solve it though
<jaawerth>	Sorella: they discuss a custom Failure option here (jlongster was initially talking about a channel going into an "error state" and some custom methods around that, which I don't like, but appears to have been set back on track) https://github.com/ubolonton/js-csp/issues/14

<derickruiz>	Hey guys, can someone please explain to me why this alerts 1? http://hastebin.com/qucelireme.js
<derickruiz>	It looks like var foo = 1 gets assigned to window.foo, and then foo = 10 in the function sets the global variable foo to 10 and then gets called.
<derickruiz>	But alerting it says 1?
<Maxdamantus>	derickruiz: `foo` is local to the function because of `function foo(){}`
*	lizzin is now known as Guest42922
<derickruiz>	Maxdamantus: Thanks! Is that variable hoisting? It's reassigning the function to be an integer?
<Maxdamantus>	Yes. That's often described as "hoisting".
<derickruiz>	Okay that makes sense that declaring a function inside of another would scope it to the parent function and it got reassigned.
<derickruiz>	Didn't know that child functions were scoped like that. Thanks a lot Maxdamantus!

<Brandan>	oh well its small it just had a very large json file to load.
<Brandan>	has*
<Schilling>	gtwy: been working with js for a while, but mainly DOM/BOM stuff.
<Brandan>	also its kind of useless without the db connection, its just a map.
<Schilling>	I've been trying to expand out to frameworks, gameing, and 3d graphics generation.
<Schilling>	gaming, even. :P
<gtwy>	Brandan: youll notice at the top of my javascript i fake the json by just creating an array and objects inside of them
<gtwy>	and fake data
<gtwy>	i understand your reluctance
<gtwy>	when i have something already all setup with AJAX i cbf to move it to jfiddle
<gtwy>	so now i start in jsfiddle and add the ajax calls in later once i get the front end code working
<gtwy>	Schilling: what kind of games
<Brandan>	It's weird though because all the buttons do is call a function with no args.
<Brandan>	it should just work haha.
<gtwy>	i clicked dispatch all
<Schilling>	Gonna start working on a JS version of the original Asteroids next week. Right now, just learning the basic ins and outs.
<gtwy>	please tell me this isnt live
<Brandan>	no its not.
<Brandan>	this is a test server
<Brandan>	lol
<gtwy>	jesus
<gtwy>	i will say, switching back and forth between php and js can be a headache. elseif vs else if. += vs .=. etc
<gtwy>	"that syntax looks correct" (it isnt correct)
*	robotmayo is now known as zz_robotmayo
<Schilling>	gtwy: I came from PHP to JS, but I find having a good understanding of the two to be useful.
<gtwy>	Brandan: if you put console.log("test") onclick do you see anything in the console on IE11
<Schilling>	but there is a lot of cussing and headbanging along the way. :P
<Brandan>	let me check
<gtwy>	Schilling: haha. ive been doing php / mysql / html / css for 10 years. started js 2 weeks ago
<Brandan>	I should turn off the CDN first.
<gtwy>	Brandan: let me rephrase, put the console.log in the function that you're calling from the onclick
<gtwy>	not directly into the onclick
<gtwy>	make it line 1 of the function
<Brandan>	i understand.
<gtwy>	i find that most of the js will run until it hits the muck up
<gtwy>	so ill keep moving the console message line by line
<gtwy>	doesnt always work
<Brandan>	I put it in Dispatch all button and it appears to work.
<Brandan>	jquery doing something weird then?
<gtwy>	but the rest of the function isnt running?
<Brandan>	Yes.
<gtwy>	can you keep moving it down one line by line
<Brandan>	You can refresh the page and see.
<Brandan>	it still works.
<Brandan>	even past $.post
<Brandan>	but it doesn't post.
<gtwy>	sounds like post is working but its getting back not what you are looking for
<gtwy>	and the logic isnt properly processing that
<gtwy>	i know it works on other browsers
<gtwy>	what version of jquery are you using
<Brandan>	well on my screen it isn't posting to index.php period.
<Brandan>	or #
<Brandan>	jQuery v1.7.2
<sinepreggin>	hi guys where can i check my js code?
<Schilling>	sinepreggin: what do you mean by 'check'?
<Brandan>	Schilling: I think he means a validator.
<sinepreggin>	Schilling: i would like to know if my code is good
<sinepreggin>	not a validator, something that can tell me what i could do better
<sinepreggin>	a validator just checks for standards
<sinepreggin>	i need a "refactorer"
<gtwy>	are you looking for like a CSS / HTML validator?
<gtwy>	only for JS
<gtwy>	jsfiddle has a "JSHint" button that will check your code for syntax errors
<Schilling>	sinepreggin: what gtwy said. Use jsfiddle and see if anything comes up. If you get errors (red dots) you can click on them to see what the error is and research it.
<Brandan>	gtwy: Its invoking the function that it should run after $.post but it isn't posting anything.
<sinepreggin>	Schilling: i'm not getting errors
<Schilling>	Then your code is probably OK. :P
<sinepreggin>	var startingValue; var finalValue;  function logCount(firstNumber, secondNumber) {   startingValue = firstNumber;   finalValue = secondNumber;   while (startingValue <= finalValue) {     console.log(startingValue);     startingValue += 2;   } }  logCount(2, 24);
<Schilling>	As far as refactors go, it really comes down to experience and opinion.
<sinepreggin>	well i'm a complete beginner
<Schilling>	Then keep learning. :)
<sinepreggin>	my code works and the stupid tdd thing is not letting me pass
<Schilling>	oh, an online tutorial?
<Schilling>	save your fiddle and send me the link.
<Schilling>	well, post the link to the room.
<hello_>	hello all, how can I refactor these lines pastebin.com/qWgB1RRP

<gtwy>	Brandan: https://twitter.com/adrianba/status/598355899904733184
<gtwy>	someone from Microsoft confirming that the bug was fixed
<Schilling>	sinepreggin: looks good. Seems to work.
<gtwy>	people are tarts, he seriously is sitting at twitter at 10:30pm searching for people insulting IE
<preaction>	no, he probably gets alerted, because that's what twitter allows you to do
<Brandan>	gtwy: It appears to be working, onclick that is, however, $.post isn't posting is the problem.
<preaction>	that is probably exactly his job
<sinepreggin>	Schilling: is there a way to improve it or do it in another way?
<BenL90>	does anyone know How to get the CSS class left-property value of a div using JavaScript?
<Brandan>	however it invokes the function afterwards.
<preaction>	"Microsoft Edge PM" <- yes. it is exactly his job
<gtwy>	cant imagine a flood of "IE" tweets
<Schilling>	sinepreggin: load this in a new window and compare. :)
<gtwy>	i shutter to think about it
<Schilling>	https://jsfiddle.net/emajdxzq/1/
<gtwy>	or is it shudderl
<Brandan>	I might beable to put it in a jsfiddle now that I know where the offending code is.
<sinepreggin>	Schilling: that's surprisingly simple
<sinepreggin>	that's so elegant whoa
<sinepreggin>	so clean
<sinepreggin>	wow
<sinepreggin>	<3
<Schilling>	;)
<sinepreggin>	i thought about doing it that way, but i didn't think it would work...
<sinepreggin>	i didn't know it could be done like that
<sinepreggin>	thank you so much!
<doug16k>	BenL90, element.boundingClientRect
<Schilling>	Oh yeah. You don't need to initialize variables outside the function. In fact, usually it's a bad idea to do that.
<sinepreggin>	i'm learning on teamtreehouse.com
<jerrt>	sinepreggin: maybe your'e supposed to return the series instead of logging to console?
<sinepreggin>	no it specifically asks to log it in the console
<Schilling>	treehouse is good.
<BenL90>	doug16k: Is that using jquery? or pure js?
<sinepreggin>	apparently it's not that good Schilling
<Schilling>	I prefer LyndaU, KhanAcademy, Codecademy or Tuts, though.
<sinepreggin>	Schilling: i never liked codecademy :(
<Schilling>	sinepreggin: what exactly were the instructions they gave?
<sinepreggin>	too buggy
<doug16k>	BenL90, well, it is probably not exactly what you wanted. you probably want https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle
<Schilling>	They've fixed a lot of them.
<sinepreggin>	The code below logs all of the even numbers from 2 to 24 to the JavaScript console. However, there's a lot of redundant code here. Re-write this using a loop.
<Schilling>	Oh, ok...
<doug16k>	BenL90, then grab left
<Schilling>	Yeah, in that case we aren't even close. :P
<sinepreggin>	it had a bunch of console.log(2) until 24 with even numbers
<sinepreggin>	this is their loop exercise
<sinepreggin>	final exercise for the "badge"
<Schilling>	oh, it's a while loop...They ask for a for loop instead?
<sinepreggin>	no
<Brandan>	gtwy: Question of the day is why isn't this https://jsfiddle.net/9w3fm1kh/7/ posting.
<sinepreggin>	 Bummer! I don't see a loop in your code. Use a while, for, or do...while loop. (A for loop is easiest.)
<Brandan>	if it is, I just don't know how to use IE's network monitor.
<doug16k>	BenL90, like window.getComputedStyle(someElement,null).getPropertyValue("left")
<jerrt>	sinepreggin: you could try https://jsfiddle.net/emajdxzq/2/ ?
<jerrt>	hell you can even remove the curly braces
<Schilling>	hmmm, that's where these get tricky. Hard to know what they want. They have a forum you can look at? I mean, you got the overall concept and your code does work.
<BenL90>	doug16k: Is that possible if we use document.getElementsByClassName() not by id?
<Schilling>	nice, jerrt.
<sinepreggin>	jerrt: that's the first thing i did, but i wanted more of a challenge so i used a while loop ;)
<sinepreggin>	but my question is, is the var necessary?
<sinepreggin>	in the for loop
<gtwy>	got mine working https://jsfiddle.net/gtwy/tbqvqdLc/9/
<sinepreggin>	why not do it outside?
<BenL90>	doug16k: is this code work if I use http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13778439/how-to-get-the-css-left-property-value-of-a-div-using-javascript
<doug16k>	BenL90, if you want the raw pixel offset, my 1st suggestion is better
<sinepreggin>	i feel so good about my programming, i know i still have a long way to go, but i'm finally starting to get it after over a year of reading books
<sinepreggin>	and struggling for a long time
<sinepreggin>	i've gotten private lessons and other stuff too
<Schilling>	yeah, you need the var in the for loop.
<doug16k>	BenL90, no, let me see if I can fiddle a more reliable way
<sinepreggin>	thanks guys for all the help.... i'm really grateful
<Schilling>	sinepreggin: it's a local variable, essentially.
<Schilling>	sinepreggin: https://jsfiddle.net/emajdxzq/3/
<lalaland1125>	sinepreggin, I would recommend learning other programming languages as well. Haskell is particularly interesting.
<sinepreggin>	could we omit it?
<Schilling>	In case you need the example in the function.
<sinepreggin>	do we have to declare local variables?
<lalaland1125>	sinepreggin, Yes.
<Schilling>	sinepreggin: woops, try this one instead. :P
<Schilling>	https://jsfiddle.net/emajdxzq/4/
<sinepreggin>	so the first thing on a for loop if a variable outside the for loop isn't declared, we use var right?
<sinepreggin>	var i = 0
<Schilling>	that's where your loop starts, yep.
<sinepreggin>	if it's outside the for (loop) then that's a global variable right?
<Schilling>	possible.
<BenL90>	doug16k: So the code is wrong, or the code not provide nothing? i try but nothing happend
<Schilling>	but more likely it'll be in a function anyway.
<jerrt>	then it's in whatever scope is outside the for loop
<sinepreggin>	i mean var i = 0 or something above the function
<Schilling>	with loops, always declare something locally.
<sinepreggin>	and then use var
<Schilling>	as in using var = whatever;
<antsanto>	Any solutions guys http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30206485/refactor-the-js-code-based-on-the-fn-call
<Schilling>	var name = whatever, rather.
<antsanto>	New to js, need your guys help
<Schilling>	i is just a common convention.
<sinepreggin>	so if it's not in the for loop parentheses as in not in here ====> for (var i = 0;) but above the for loop, it's a global variable?
<Schilling>	yes, and points to a different object in memory.
<sinepreggin>	thanks
<sinepreggin>	i feel so good understanding this stuff!
<Schilling>	keep truckin'. Lots more to go.
<sinepreggin>	you have no idea how hard it was for me to get to this level
<sinepreggin>	learning programming was the hardest thing i've done in my life
<Schilling>	Loops take a while to figure out. Scope issues...well, I figured those out as I went along.
<lalaland1125>	antsanto, You can use the [] operator to access something by name. So $($(obj).children()[1])[nameOfFunction](argument).attr('title',someFn('a')).addClass(addClassParam);
<lalaland1125>	Where name of function is like "children" and argument is ".test1" or something.
<lalaland1125>	antsanto, You should also use a for loop instead of repeating the same line 7 times.
<lalaland1125>	for (var i =1; i <=7;i++) { $($(obj).children()[i]).children('.test1').attr('title',someFn('a' + i)).addClass('class1');
<lalaland1125>	Or something like that.
<sinepreggin>	Schilling: i have a problem where my code works on my first implementation, but it's not the optimal solution... how would i check for the speed of the code?
<sinepreggin>	is there some sort of plugin or something?
<jerrt>	sinepreggin: just a heads up: https://twitter.com/bhalp1/status/578925947245633536
<sinepreggin>	jerrt: i haven't gotten to "this" in javascript, but would i'm guessing it's the current object right?
<doug16k>	BenL90, http://jsfiddle.net/a205zay0/
<lalaland1125>	sinepreggin, Built in browser tools usually include a profiler. Chrome in particular has a good one.
<sinepreggin>	i haven't read about it
<sinepreggin>	it's like self in ruby right?
<jerrt>	sinepreggin: current scope. you'll get it as you go along
<jerrt>	it makes sense most of the time
<sinepreggin>	self took me a while to understand
<lalaland1125>	This is dynamically scoped based on how you call the function. When you call the function anObject.aFunction(), this is equal to anObject.
<Schilling>	Chrome and FF has good testing tools.
<sinepreggin>	i don't get why they couldn't use current_object in ruby instead
<Schilling>	'this' and 'self' is faster to type.
<gtwy>	sinepreggin: spend a lot of time reading about this for sure
<gtwy>	sinepreggin: its very helpful
<Schilling>	I've been messing around with knockoutJS today and at the top of Class is var self = this;
<gtwy>	Brandan: i missed your msg
<gtwy>	looking now
<doug16k>	sinepreggin, you are almost implying that long names make you understand it faster
<doug16k>	nobody uses pascal
<Brandan>	gtwy:  I got this to work https://jsfiddle.net/9w3fm1kh/26/
<Brandan>	i don't know why that works
<Brandan>	but it's not too hard to update the code in that format.
<gtwy>	you had the URL in the () before
<gtwy>	right?
<Brandan>	gtwy: this was the old code http://pastebin.com/8THuuU7E
<Brandan>	so yes.
<sinepreggin>	doug16k: yes they do
<gtwy>	looks like its not the right syntax, but not far enough off that it wouldnt work
<gtwy>	but IE is obviously more picky
<sinepreggin>	longer, more descriptive names, make me understand things a lot better
<gtwy>	since its the first element of the object
<Brandan>	probably, its an easy fix though.
<BenL90>	doug16k: Wait, I don't see anything that return the value :o
<sinepreggin>	maybe it's because i'm retarded
<doug16k>	BenL90, line 4??
<ljharb>	please don't use that word
<doug16k>	line 13 converts the object to text
<Brandan>	gtwy, werid that it doesn't throw an exception though
<doug16k>	12*
<sinepreggin>	ljharb: i have a learning disability, so i kinda qualify as being retarded though... :*(
<doug16k>	BenL90, line 4 returns an object with a left property and a top property
<sinepreggin>	lalaland1125: where can we learn to use the profiler?
<ljharb>	sinepreggin: your personal issues are irrelevant, please don't use that word.
<ljharb>	thanks
<gtwy>	sinepreggin: just ignore ljharb
<sinepreggin>	okay /ignore right?
<ljharb>	i wouldn't recommend that.
<doug16k>	I wouldn't
<sinepreggin>	okay i've ignored ljharb
<sinepreggin>	i don't like trolls... :(
<gtwy>	lol i meant dont argue with he/she but whatever
<ljharb>	!coc @ sinepreggin
<ecmabot>	sinepreggin: The JSConf and #npm Codes of Conduct are good resources to understand how people should conduct themselves on this channel - < http://jsconf.com/codeofconduct.html > and < http://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct/ >
<ljharb>	gtwy: also, you're not doing anyone, including yourself, any favors by stirring up trouble like that.
<BenL90>	doug16k: Hmm, I see that code, I mean in the HTML. So this code will return the left value?
<phalaon>	Hi, what is the best way to toggle multiple classes? without code repeating? I use clean javascript, because of compatability. .classList.toggle('class1 class2') doesnt work.
<lalaland1125>	sinepreggin, Google would probably be the best way to answer that question. However a simple solution is to simply use console.time and console.timeEnd (https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console-api#consoletimelabel)
<doug16k>	no, it returns the left AND top
<ljharb>	phalaon: if you're worried about compatibility, classList isn't a good idea :-)
<ljharb>	phalaon: toggle only accepts one class name.
<ljharb>	phalaon: so you need to call it N times to toggle N classes.
<doug16k>	BenL90, I gave the solution on a silver platter with test case and all, already: http://jsfiddle.net/a205zay0/
<doug16k>	that function is the only part that you need, the rest is test case
<lalaland1125>	phalaon, Write a helper function. toggleMultipleClasses or something.
<phalaon>	ljharb : ok thanks.
<BenL90>	doug16k: Hmm, okay, Thanks
<jaawerth>	you could just write a function that takes an array of classes and uses .forEach on it to toggle each one, or slices the arguments into an array and then does the same (so you don't always have to pass in an array)
<jaawerth>	IIRC there's a shim for classList if you don't want to include full jquery or whatever
<doug16k>	BenL90, it returns an object with 2 properties: left, and top. the left value is how far element is from relativeTo, sideways, and top is how far it is downward
<gtwy>	jaawerth: i havent been doing this long enough to know, but from what ive read, "for" is a lot more effecient than "foreach"
<doug16k>	BenL90, var relPos = getRelativePositionOf(someChild, someAncestor);  then use it -> ... relPos.left ...   relPos.top ...
<gtwy>	jaawerth: https://coderwall.com/p/kvzbpa/don-t-use-array-foreach-use-for-instead
<gtwy>	not sure if true or not
<ljharb>	luckily efficiency is usually irrelevant on that scale
<jaawerth>	gtwy: "for" is often faster, but forEach is both more readable and less error prone
<jaawerth>	and yeah, that is rarely ever going to be your bottleneck
<ljharb>	and unless you have profiled your whole app, and your array iteration is at the top, i wouldn't ever waste time writing a loop :-)
<jaawerth>	also, while there are a million microbenchmarks on, like, jsperf that show it's faster, none of those are in real world situations, which is an important distinctoin bnecause real-world situations are where the engine/compiler does all of its fancy optimization tricks
<ljharb>	jsperf's a fun way to play with alternatives, but if it's not in your real app code, you're just playing with toys
<jaawerth>	ultimately coding for speed just isn't a good idea anyway, better to code it in a modular, composable, readable way and then optimize on a future pass if you need to improve speed
<Sorella>	sinepreggin: what ljharb meant by "please don't use that word" is basically "avoid using such terms in the channel because they make some people with disabilities feel unwelcome." :)
<gtwy>	jaawerth: thats good advice
<gtwy>	thanks
<jaawerth>	sure thing
<doug16k>	BenL90, on second thought, there doesn't need to be any special relationship. that code will give the offset of any elements no matter where they are in the hierarchy

<gtwy>	in the last week no less
<zomg>	The one thing I can say about the overzealous policing about the same on #node.js is at least they did that in PM for most part..
<zomg>	so it didn't stir up the pointless repetitive "discussion" on the channel so much
<ljharb>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯ i never do it in PM in that channel.
<forQuery>	i have to check about 200 checkboxes on a page
<forQuery>	is there sometype of sleect all by tag name and add attribute checked that I can type into the console
<ljharb>	gtwy: you're welcome to ignore it. but it's just causing trouble to tell other people to ignore it.
<forQuery>	and save myself carpel tunnel
<ljharb>	forQuery: sure, it's super easy if jquery's available
<forQuery>	no jquery...
<ljharb>	forQuery: you can use document.querySelectorAll then
<forQuery>	yes, i found a neat script online :)
<ljharb>	gtwy: and seeing 3 arguments in random times over a week isn't that much of a sample size, when i've been here most hours in a day for years and seen how much worse it gets when nobody speaks up.
<Sorella>	gtwy: yeah, the arguments that originated from that weren't a great thing. We're Still Trying To Improve On That™ :)
<forQuery>	http://nathangiesbrecht.com/check-all-checkboxes-chrome-javascript  when i paste this short snippit into the console to sleect all checkboxes
<forQuery>	i get back undefined but nothing checks
<Sorella>	gtwy: though, that there are arguments at all when you tell people "please, be mindful of group X when speaking" kinda means we have a problem. Trying to address it in some way is a good thing. Though yeah, we can probably do better in how we address it
<gtwy>	i think its off putting because its after the first infraction, such as an off comment rather than a constant way someone talks
<Brandan>	gtwy: Thanks for the assistance my beautiful map now works on the crappiest browser in existence.
<gtwy>	Brandan: glad to hear
<duellsy>	would anybody be able to help me with including a js library into my app using require? I want to bring in parsleyjs, as well as bring in some translations with it
<ljharb>	gtwy: fair point. but, almost without fail, people who talk that way on the first interaction do talk that way constantly.
<ljharb>	duellsy: look into browserify
<jaawerth>	to be fair, there's only so much improvement you're going to see from changing the positioning of the "please don't say X", there's definitely been a major trend/backlash recently on these kinds of issues in techie/geeky communities over the last year or so
<BenL90>	doug16k: Okay, firstly thanks for the code, I'm really not know what is it, but your code solve my problem, I'm new in JS and pratically just 3 days learning it..(last sunday i just learn, so I'm kind of dumb shit), http://s28.postimg.org/r2cdxstwt/Untitled.jpg. I have last question, how if i only want the number or value and declare it into a variable? like var A=130 that comes from class b.
<ljharb>	jaawerth: right, it's not that it'll fix everything, but it makes it clear that intolerance isn't tolerated :-) which is important.
<jaawerth>	oh, right
<duellsy>	my project is already in existence, and it's huge. need to stick with requirejs
<Sorella>	gtwy: most of the time those people are not aware that there's a problem in the way they speak.
<jaawerth>	ljharb: I just meant you saying it in a gentler way isn't going to stop people raging about it
<ljharb>	duellsy: browserify has requirejs transforms
<ljharb>	jaawerth: oh, totally. people that rage about being asked to watch their language are going to cause trouble no matter what's said.
<gtwy>	ok ill give you another example, an automated bot that posts a pre-canned nice response to keywords would be better
<Sorella>	(There's a great essay about that here: http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/purity.html)
<gtwy>	because theres not an individual "attacking" them
<gtwy>	just a robot
<gtwy>	and then if they brush it off, people can say, no really thats how it is here we are open to all
<gtwy>	but when another user (w/o @) just corrects them it comes off like a power trip
<doug16k>	BenL90, it would be A.left if you kept those names
<duellsy>	ljharb how will browserify be better for me than requirejs though, not to be arrogant
<ljharb>	gtwy: that's not a bad idea
<ljharb>	duellsy: because it opens up all of npm, and because eventually you can use it to get rid of requirejs, since sync requires are much better than amd
<BenL90>	doug16k: In css? Or JS?
<doug16k>	JS
<Sorella>	duellsy: if you already have a huge app using requirejs, it's a lot harder to move, yeah =/
<duellsy>	ljharb ok, will look into it more. I don't have the time to port everything over at the moment, so was wondering if you could point me in the right direction of loading an existing package pulled in with bower, into my main app
<duellsy>	Sorella yeah, it's pretty big
<gtwy>	ljharb: glad we could talk. maybe i was too quick to start judging people. on that note, its 2am here. ciao
<ljharb>	duellsy: ouch, bower too :-/
<duellsy>	?
<ljharb>	duellsy: the reality is that you have to wrap it with AMD. browserify will let you do that.
<ljharb>	(bower is a glorified curl, not a package manager - npm is infinitely better)
<jaawerth>	there are also bundlers that'll interoperate with any format
<duellsy>	sure
<duellsy>	for now, perhaps I'll just have to copy the folder and make edits to the files to AMD wrap
<ljharb>	duellsy: sure, you can do that. but i'm saying browserify will do that for you automatically.
<ljharb>	you just have to use the right transform
<doug16k>	duellsy, http://bower.io/docs/tools/ - basic idea is you put some placeholders in some place where you want to load the blob, and grunt injects the actual path
<BenL90>	doug16k: When I called it, it show undefined
<doug16k>	(the blob of stuff you loaded with bower)
<duellsy>	thanks, I totally believe and trust you, but I don't have the time to change this all to use browserify, under the pump :P
<duellsy>	doug16k thanks
<ljharb>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯ i'm still just telling you to make this *one* file use browserify, not everything else.
<ljharb>	but ok
<jaawerth>	alright, bedtime for real this time...
<duellsy>	ljharb does it make a difference that everything gets compiled to a single file?
<ljharb>	duellsy: browserify can make as many bundles as you want.
<duellsy>	right
<doug16k>	BenL90, paste of that line?
<BenL90>	doug16k: http://s28.postimg.org/opmh0m4q5/Untitled.jpg
<doug16k>	BenL90, #debug3
<doug16k>	you forgot the #
<doug16k>	oh and you didnt assign it to anything
<doug16k>	save that and paste the url here
<doug16k>	update, I mean
<doug16k>	A is the dom element
<ProLoser>	any math or algorithm gurus?
<falafel>	!ask @ ProLoser
<ecmabot>	ProLoser: Don't ask to ask, nor if anyone is here or alive or uses something. Just ask your question. http://www.mikeash.com/getting_answers.html http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
<ProLoser>	i have a screen, lets say 1440 wide. i can break this screen into 1,2,3,4,5... column grids
<ProLoser>	every time i fire a squeeze command, i want to get the dimension of the next smallest step, chances are i won't go past 4 columns, but i'd like to make this algorithm fairly versatile. now the first time you fire 'squeeze' you would get a dimension of 4/5 the screen, then 3/4, then 2/3, etc
<ProLoser>	but after a certain point the order is inconsistent, such as when you go from 3/4 to 3/5 to 2/3 to 1/2
<falafel>	ProLoser, do you have a demo to reproduce this issue?
<falafel>	not sure I understand what you want to do ...
<ProLoser>	i'm trying to build it
<ProLoser>	i'm doing a window management tool
<ProLoser>	you specify up to how many columns the screen can be split
<ProLoser>	lets say you specify 3
<ProLoser>	that means a window can be split into 1 column or 2 columns or 3 columns
<doug16k>	BenL90, is this better http://jsfiddle.net/a205zay0/3/
<forQuery>	is it bad to apply transform:translateZ(0) to the body element?
<ProLoser>	when i hit shirnk, i want to know what the new dimension of the window i should use
<falafel>	ProLoser, so division? what other math is involved?
<ProLoser>	what's the best way to know which grid breakdown is the next division to use?
<ProLoser>	a window can be 1/2, 1/1, 1/3, 2/3
<ProLoser>	how do i know which one to go to next?
<doug16k>	forQuery, try it and see on a few important browsers
<falafel>	ProLoser, why can't you keep the divisor the same? so 3/4 === 3.75/5
<forQuery>	well it gets rid of all paint in chrome on scroll
<forQuery>	but, i hear it's bad to do
<doug16k>	you probably wont be able to properly measure power use though
<ProLoser>	falafel: cuz then you have to start moving the window around
<ProLoser>	if a window is split into a division of thirds, it can only move around in those divisions
<falafel>	ProLoser, ah
<ProLoser>	2/3 left, 2/3 right, or 1/3 middle, left or right
<doug16k>	forQuery, classic tradeoff of throwing memory at something to make it go fast
<ProLoser>	the idea for the tool is you specify up to how many columns you want to split up your screen, and you squish windows/apps against the edge of the screen and then move them around
<ProLoser>	it's an extremely intuitive UI, but the code is kind of crappy
<ProLoser>	so i'm rewriting it
<falafel>	ProLoser, not sure what to tell you, I'd have to try it out to figure it out, amybe you can simulate this in a fiddle, using the window width, and a bunch of divs as panels
<BenL90>	doug16k: I just need the Value of the left. from the rectElement.left - rectAncestor.left with B,A
<doug16k>	ProLoser, left and right can be percentages
<falafel>	but a percentage is a rational number too. Can't you have the ratios pre-set? I mean the order?
<ProLoser>	what do you mean?
<doug16k>	ProLoser, the left pane might have left:0% right:50% - the right pane can be left:50%, right: 100%
<ProLoser>	the order is always biggest to smallest
<sinepreggin>	a rational number is a number that doesn't fuck with your head
<doug16k>	ProLoser, the order is irrelevant
<ProLoser>	well i mean, if you do 2/3
<doug16k>	the beginnings/ends would happen to line up
<falafel>	doug16k, from what I understand he wants to know what the next optimal ratio is
<ProLoser>	i suppose i could just hardcode all the steps in percentages
<doug16k>	24 is extremely evenly divisible
<falafel>	that's what I mean
<ProLoser>	like [100%, 66.6%, 50%, 33%]
<falafel>	yup, that's what I'd do
<doug16k>	ProLoser, hard code? are you nuts?
<doug16k>	write a loop
<ProLoser>	of what?
<suvek>	from where i start javascript i just finished codeacadmy
<doug16k>	code generator
<falafel>	well, hardcode in that you know which ratios come next, you generate it, but the ratios are pre-set
<ProLoser>	right
<sinepreggin>	suvek: read eluquent javascript it's an amazing book
<doug16k>	some little snippet that generates the values and emits a bit string
<doug16k>	big*
<ProLoser>	so lets say i have a window set to 33%
<sinepreggin>	suvek: they have great exercises and you even make a chess game :)
<ProLoser>	how do i calculate his x and y starting point?
<sinepreggin>	http://eloquentjavascript.net
<ProLoser>	actually that's easy
<falafel>	ProLoser, in relation to another window you mean?
<sinepreggin>	ProLoser: by using math?
<doug16k>	its parent's width
<doug16k>	ProLoser, go here, I wrote the splitter: jstraight.com
<doug16k>	it uses percentages
<ProLoser>	ok
<ProLoser>	and?
<doug16k>	resize the whole browser - it scales proportionally
<falafel>	CSS does that though, I mean you need no calculations
<doug16k>	it is a percent of its parent's size
<ProLoser>	that's not the issue
<suvek>	sinepreggin, thanks
<doug16k>	if left was 50% then left = parent_width()*0.5
<falafel>	I think he's talking aboout something like i3
<ProLoser>	what about 66%
<falafel>	a tiling window manager
<falafel>	?
<ProLoser>	how do i calculate what it's left should be?
<ProLoser>	parent_width()*.6 doesn't work
<doug16k>	yeah, probably a few femtometers of inaccuracy yeah
<ProLoser>	so yeah that's my fundamental issue, coming up with a consisten way to calculate such things
<ProLoser>	i mean so far i've quite literally been hardcoding some of this stuff for different grid layouts, but it's horribly brittle
<doug16k>	so you have this machine in front of you that could generate the code for you but you wrote it manually?
<ProLoser>	what's the formula to generate it
<ProLoser>	at what point do you do width - percent * width vs just 0 vs just width * percent * index
<doug16k>	to divide it into N divisions, each divider is at 100/(N-1) + "%"
<ProLoser>	like a 33% column in the middle
<ProLoser>	right but what if i want it to be a like 2/5 or 3/5 or 2/3
<doug16k>	ProLoser, then you can treat it like a 1D vector and normalize
<ProLoser>	honestly for now we can pretned i'm not going to 5ths
<ProLoser>	just 4ths
<ProLoser>	what do you mean?
<doug16k>	say the sum of widths now is 200... but you want it to be 250... and there are N viewports side by side... then all you do is multiply each one's width by 250/200
<doug16k>	as in 250 divided by 200
<doug16k>	another way to look at it...
<doug16k>	take the sum of all the viewports...
<doug16k>	widths*
<doug16k>	now each one is 100*width/sum % wide
<doug16k>	that leaves you with values from 0.0 to 1.0
<doug16k>	1.0 is the whole window size
<doug16k>	that value * 100 is the percent width of that viewport
<doug16k>	say you have 2 splitters, one at 12%, and one at 50%
<doug16k>	that gives 3 viewports: 0-12%, 12%-50%, 50%-100%
<doug16k>	0.12, 0.38, 0.5
<doug16k>	sum = 1
<doug16k>	css lets you literally do left: 12%  width: 38%
<doug16k>	the css layout engine is doing practically all the work
<doug16k>	your code doesn't even need to care about pixels, except for in mouse events
<falafel>	you can even use `calc` if you want to mix percentages and pixels, or other measures
<prohobo>	falalalalalafel
<falafel>	prohohohohobo
<prohobo>	well thats a bad part of the name to get stuck on
<forQuery>	so i can get paint down to pretty much 0.... but GPU usage goes up to 90mb
<forQuery>	hmm
<MarkProffitt>	Hello.  I am trying to make a sortable list that allows items to also be equal
<doug16k>	MarkProffitt, sort as in alphabetical or as in drag and drop?
<MarkProffitt>	drag & drop
<doug16k>	meaning 2 things on one "row" ?
<doug16k>	equal in what way?
*	michd is now known as MichD
<MarkProffitt>	doug16k, yes, same row
<doug16k>	MarkProffitt, sounds like rows need to be droppable themselves, and when it happens,append it as a child and fixup the widths
<doug16k>	MarkProffitt, go raw draggable/droppable. not sure sortable can handle that
<MarkProffitt>	doug16k, Yes drag/droppable is fine. I also need to be able to add rows above, bellow or inbetween
<MarkProffitt>	doug16k,  ie sortable by row
<doug16k>	yeah each row would be a horizontal sortable
<doug16k>	sounds cool
<doug16k>	MarkProffitt, trying obvious/easy ideas
*	PaulePan1er is now known as PaulePanter
<MarkProffitt>	doug16k,  I have a version with drop and one with sortable that allows on the same row (div / ul) for each row, but I can't add row smoothly
<doug16k>	doesn't work but docs imply that it might http://www.jstraight.com/1253/1
<MarkProffitt>	doug16k,  OK, the connectWith looks like something to try
<doug16k>	works better but no http://www.jstraight.com/1253/2
*	Caroga_afk is now known as Caroga
<doug16k>	mark I did it
<doug16k>	MarkProffitt, *
<doug16k>	MarkProffitt, http://www.jstraight.com/1253/3
<MarkProffitt>	doug16k,  how?? :)
<MarkProffitt>	doug16k that is almost what I need
<doug16k>	yeah just a proof of concept
<MarkProffitt>	doug16k, I think the sortable and droppable might need to be reversed.  It needs to create more rows
<doug16k>	that is just the example dom hierarchy
<doug16k>	you can probably fix the nesting to make it work like that
<MarkProffitt>	doug16k,  nope, I'm confused
*	Gurkenglas_ is now known as Gurkenglas
<helvetet>	http://jsfiddle.net/dbg2kkjL/
<TyrfingMjolnir>	What is 2 brackets back to back? passport.authenticate( 'local' )( req, res, function () {
<helvetet>	what am i doing wrong?
*	musty_ is now known as musty
<helvetet>	(don't want it to output undefined)
<gildean>	TyrfingMjolnir: if the first function returns a function, you can call the returning function immediately like that
<ankr>	helvetet data[0]['front/slash']
<helvetet>	ah
<doug16k>	TyrfingMjolnir, authenticate returns a function, it calls it right away
<TyrfingMjolnir>	gildean: So the 2nd bracket is the parameter for the function returned by the first function?
<doug16k>	right
<TyrfingMjolnir>	Perfect
<TyrfingMjolnir>	Thank you
<helvetet>	thanks

<ankr>	wow, what's going on in here?
<Mackan90096>	Okay. I have this array. How do I get the length of it? I know I can use .length; but that is not 0 indexed.
<ljharb>	just a troll, no worries.
<ljharb>	Mackan90096: .length is the length.
<falafel>	Mackan90096, sparse arrays are bad
<ljharb>	Mackan90096: if you want 0 indexed, subtract 1.
<ljharb>	Mackan90096: but also, you shouldn't need to think about the length. just use an array iteration method.
<Mackan90096>	ah. Okay, thanks
<varrg>	0 index length makes no sense
<falafel>	oh, I misunderstood
<falafel>	length is a count, why should it be zero based?
<Mackan90096>	Well, I have a random number gen that pulls data from the array, like, array[1] etc :P
<varrg>	Mackan90096, so make the .length non-inclusiev

<doug16k>	you want to go to those meetings? no? me either
<Xatenev>	We dont have a lot of meetings
<Xatenev>	its good that they hold us the customer off
<Xatenev>	but they should be able to write good grammar and submit tasks which are not written completly cryptic xd
<doug16k>	exactly, and we should give to the poor
<ankr>	Xatenev I think that's a global problem
<Xatenev>	ankr: yop
<doug16k>	project manager bugs arent that great. they dont have the same obsession with details that devs/testers would have
<Xatenev>	Yea but we had like 3 meetins
<Xatenev>	meetings
<Xatenev>	where we just explained how a ticket should look like
<Xatenev>	for example add a screenshot to show whats meant
<Xatenev>	such easy stuff, which is just not done by those people, cause they don'T care about their job enough
<Xatenev>	imho
<doug16k>	maybe. or maybe the dev team doesnt care enough to instrument the code and store sufficient logs for investigation, and nobody wrote a script that auto-does it
<Xatenev>	maybe
<Xatenev>	Too bad I dont got anything to say here
<Xatenev>	:P
<phalaon>	Is there alternative :lt() selector in javasript?
<doug16k>	phalaon, you probably mean Array slice
<varrg>	phalaon, what's a :lt() selector
<varrg>	is that supposed to look like css?
<Xatenev>	its jquery
<doug16k>	varrg jquery
<deltab>	well, sizzle
<varrg>	ah right. phalaon, just filter it
<doug16k>	use .slice
<RLa>	what does :lt do?
<doug16k>	$('.piles-of-elements').slice(4, 8)
<RLa>	less-than selector?
<doug16k>	take 8 elements starting at index 4
<Xatenev>	RLa: it selects all elements with index less than (index)
<doug16k>	pure js would be Array.prototype.slice.call(document.querySelector('.foo'), 4, 8).forEach...
<doug16k>	$('.foo:lt(5)')   should be $('.foo').lt(5)
<falafel>	which is basically $('.foo').slice(0,5)
<doug16k>	Xatenev, do you want pure js though? if not, see #jquery
<RLa>	"index"?
<RLa>	in resulting array?
<phalaon>	$('.foo a:lt(' + toShow +')').show(); it's jquery i need similar in pure js
<doug16k>	index finds an element in a jquery
<RLa>	not as index in matched parent children?
<falafel>	qsa('.foo').slice(0, toShow), if toShow is positive
<falafel>	!snip qsa
<ecmabot>	falafel: This snippet mimics jQuery syntax while being much lighter: function qsa(sel, parent){ return Array.prototype.slice.call((parent || document).querySelectorAll(sel)); }
<Xatenev>	doug16k: u mean me?
<krz>	whats a good method to check if a string is either 'foo' or 'bar'?
<falafel>	RLa, it's the index of the element in the collection
<doug16k>	I got confused about who was who, sorry
<Xatenev>	krz: if(string == 'foo') ? ^^
<krz>	something like 'e' in ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] (coffeescript)
<falafel>	krz, indexOf
<falafel>	that's basically what the coffee compiles to afaik
<Xatenev>	falafel: noo
<varrg>	if (string.indexOf(['foo','bar']) !== -1)
<Xatenev>	falafel not sure bout that
<Xatenev>	:p
<tarkus>	Is there a good fast alternative to _.template() (need to render index.html for SPA)
<varrg>	oh, other way around :D
<Xatenev>	he wrote "IS" foo bar , but with indexOf whatevrefoo would work too
<doug16k>	Array.prototype.slice.call(qsa('.foo'), 0, toShow).forEach(function() { this.style.display = 'auto'; })
<doug16k>	oops
<falafel>	Xatenev, uh?
<doug16k>	....forEach(function(element) { element.style.display = 'auto'; })
<zap0>	currently i'm loading a script via  CreateElement("script").src = 'foo.js'    sometimes this can take a long time, how would i go about getting some type of progress callback?  or is there a way to find out how much of that file has loaded?
<krz>	in ruby we have %w[foo bar].includes? 'bar'
<RLa>	tarkus, why need alternative?
<falafel>	if (['foo','baz'].indexOf(string) > -1)
<krz>	if (string.indexOf(['foo','bar']) !== -1) looks nasty
<tarkus>	RLa, whant to get rid off lodash (I mostly use it for its _.template())
<Xatenev>	ok includes
<Xatenev>	nevermind, I thought he wanted to check if a string is EQUAL foo
<RLa>	krz, it depends on your first language
<falafel>	krz, if (['foo','baz'].some(is(string)), where is=x=>y=>x===y
<Xatenev>	and not INCLUDES foo
<RLa>	i mean native language
<RLa>	verb-object-subject order
<falafel>	Xatenev, indexOf you'd use it on an array, not a string, you check if a string is in an array of strings, that's basically what the coffeescript he posted does
<Xatenev>	falafel: what coffeescript?
<Xatenev>	wtf
<falafel>	Xatenev, the one krz posted
<Xatenev>	no idea what u taling about
<falafel>	you got lost
<Xatenev>	I dont see any coffeescript there
<Xatenev>	Maybe its too early no idea
<falafel>	b>let is=x=>y=>x===y; let str='foo'; ['foo','baz'].some(is(str)) @ krz
<varrg>	unlike coffee, one can code coffeescript event at night
<babelbot>	krz: true
<Xatenev>	dont understand what u just said before aswell lol falafel
<Xatenev>	he just asked how to check if a string is foo or bar
<Xatenev>	I said .indexOf checks if a string CONTAINS foo or bars
<falafel>	Xatenev, ['foo','baz'].indexOf('
<falafel>	Xatenev, ['foo','baz'].indexOf('foo
<Xatenev>	yea but he didnt say that before
<falafel>	indexOf is a method of arrays and strings
<Xatenev>	yop
<falafel>	he did, that's what the coffee he posted means
<Xatenev>	absolutely
<Xatenev>	can u post the coffeescript again
<falafel>	<krz> something like 'e' in ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] (coffeescript)
<falafel>	['a','b','c','d'].indexOf('e') > -1
<Xatenev>	rofl
<Xatenev>	im obviously completly mentally damaged
<falafel>	or like I posted, ['a','b','c','d'].some(is('e'))
*	Xatenev goes back home
<Xatenev>	didnt see that he posted that at all lol, his text and name got a dumb color ><
<TyrfingMjolnir>	which tool to use to make a new file with only the code in use?
<varrg>	TyrfingMjolnir, keyboard
<varrg>	i.e. do it yourself
<RLa>	closure compiler would remove dead code too
<ankr>	TyrfingMjolnir http://jsfiddle.net/ankr/c4Age/
<RLa>	ankr, how the fuck?
<RLa>	that is serious security bug
<RLa>	holy damn
<RLa>	FF asks confirmation but Chrome does not
<Xatenev>	RLa: depends
<Xatenev>	u can activate or deactivate the confirmation
<Xatenev>	i think so atleast
<falafel>	asks for confirmation in both FF and Chrome for me
<RLa>	it should never download a file without manual click or confirmation
<ankr>	chrome doesn't ask me
<RLa>	same
<Xatenev>	Like i said, u have to activate it
<Xatenev>	its deactivated normally I think
<ankr>	Safari ignores it completely
<Xatenev>	But well, that shit is known :)^^
<falafel>	oh, you may be right, I have the ask activated
<Xatenev>	yeap
<RLa>	is this reported?
<Xatenev>	Its no bug
<Xatenev>	So theres no need to report it
<RLa>	you consider it a feature?
<falafel>	that's not different from doing `window.location=text.txt`
<falafel>	in that it would trigger a download too, if the server sends the correct response
<Xatenev>	RLa: i dont see ur problem
<RLa>	now i see how peoples computers still get hacked
<Xatenev>	Activate the checkbox
<Xatenev>	and ur safe
<falafel>	how?
<falafel>	how do they get hacked?
<RLa>	you trigger download to some .exe file
<falafel>	and...
<RLa>	some users will run the exe after download
<Xatenev>	If they run the exe
<Xatenev>	then they will confirm the donwload aswell
<Xatenev>	:)
<varrg>	^
<RLa>	you do not need to confirm download
<falafel>	the problem is the user was using Windows
<falafel>	:P
<RLa>	as already seen
<Xatenev>	falafel: Windows is gud
<Xatenev>	:P
<Xatenev>	RLa: i dont get u
<eriam>	woah it's huge in here
<Xatenev>	If the user is starting the .exe file
<RLa>	Xatenev, that code downloads file to my computer without asking confirmation on Chrome
<Xatenev>	then he will DEFINETLY confirm if he wnana downloads it or not
<Xatenev>	Yea cause u didnt activate the checkbox
<Xatenev>	and obviously u have too less idea to keep care about the security at ur PC
<Xatenev>	thats absolutely no bug
<Xatenev>	not even a problem
<doug16k>	zap0, ajax has progress calLBACKS
<RLa>	also, in many countries you can get jailed for just having a presence of a file in your computer
<RLa>	no need to even run anything
<Xatenev>	Yop
<Xatenev>	So just dont download it
<doug16k>	you can get jailed for body parts that someone else put in your house, too
<varrg>	or you could get steak
<falafel>	for drugs that somebody put in your car, if you've seen Cops, it happens all the time, everybody is innocent
<TyrfingMjolnir>	varrg: For web I use plvor
<TyrfingMjolnir>	plovr
<TyrfingMjolnir>	But for node, what to use?
<falafel>	plus Windows users have antivirus, every download should be analyzed by the antivirus
<varrg>	dunno
<ankr>	*should*
<jwpapi>	Hello
<ankr>	morning
<jwpapi>	whats my mistake when js is chaning numbers instead of adding them?
<Xatenev>	falafel: yeap but too less people even use that stuff
<Xatenev>	Honestly, everybody who has no idea about holding their PC clean should use linux
<ankr>	jwpapi you are probably adding strings
<doug16k>	jwpapi, convert string to number with leading +
<Xatenev>	cause theres not as much trash in the internet as for windows
<doug16k>	js> '123' + 45
<ecmabot>	doug16k: (string) '12345'
<doug16k>	js> +'123' + 45
<ecmabot>	doug16k: (number) 168
<falafel>	everybody should use free software, it is infinitely more secure
<varrg>	Xatenev, anyone not able to keep their pc clean, won't understand linux
<Xatenev>	Actually windows rocks
<Xatenev>	:P
<Xatenev>	varrg: yap
<Xatenev>	thats the problem
<Xatenev>	:P
<jwpapi>	ok gimme a sec
<ankr>	>> "1,2" + [4,5,6][1]
<ecmabot>	ankr: (string) '1,25'
<falafel>	Xatenev, I don't like potential of being spied on, specially in the US
<falafel>	it can always happen, but I'd rather cut my chances
<Xatenev>	spied on?
<Xatenev>	like what?
<jwpapi>	var tconversions = 0 ;var tconversions = tconversions +conversions;
<pi->	falafel: shouldn't that read "Everyone should just avoid Windows -- as it is infinitely LESS secure"?
<Xatenev>	who says ur not being spied by linux?
<Xatenev>	which is actually done falafel
<falafel>	Xatenev,government, companies, whomever
<Xatenev>	ubuntu spies on u atleast
<RLa>	pi-, i use linux and chrome can still sneak files to my computer
<jwpapi>	linux does not help if yount want to get spied
<varrg>	jwpapi, +conversions + tconversions;
<RLa>	pi-, linux does not protect me
<falafel>	pi-, but not just Windows, IMO everybody should avoid non-free software as much as possible
<RLa>	help
<doug16k>	proprietary software is basically malware now. can you trust it? no
<falafel>	even calendar apps collect information now, a fucking calendar
<Xatenev>	falafel: u should go with arch if u dont want to be spied
<Xatenev>	:p
<pi->	The issue I see is with closed vs open source kernels. Money doesn't necessarily enter into the equation.
<falafel>	Xatenev, I am on linux
<Xatenev>	and build ur complete own system
<Xatenev>	what linux?
<doug16k>	if it isnt malware the installer prbably tries to install some
<Xatenev>	ubuntu spies on u for example ;)
<jwpapi>	var tconversions = +tconversions +conversions;
<jwpapi>	like that?
<jwpapi>	i get nan now
<Xatenev>	debian doesn't from what we know atleast :p
<doug16k>	jwpapi, then tconversions isnt a number
<jwpapi>	i made var tconversions = 0;
<doug16k>	where
<Xatenev>	cause ubuntus package manager keeps sending data about your system and installed programs
<doug16k>	closure scope?
<jwpapi>	before the while loop
<varrg>	jwpapi, don't var it again
<jwpapi>	ahh yes shame on me
<doug16k>	>> +'' @ jwpapi
<ecmabot>	jwpapi: (number) 0
<falafel>	Xatenev, uh? Ubuntu doesn't spy on you in that way, no. Amazon lens can be deactivated, and so can be the bug report system
<doug16k>	>> +undefined @ jwpapi
<ecmabot>	jwpapi: (number) NaN
<Xatenev>	falafel: of course it can be deactivated
<doug16k>	>> (+undefined||0) @ jwpapi
<ecmabot>	jwpapi: (number) 0
<Xatenev>	but its activated at the start
<Xatenev>	:p
<doug16k>	>> (+undefined||0) + 5 @ jwpapi
<ecmabot>	jwpapi: (number) 5
<falafel>	Ubuntu doesn't have a universal backdoor, and they can't use your computer remotely at will
<Xatenev>	and its not asking you
<doug16k>	oops, sorry I usually spam in PM with ecmabot
<Xatenev>	can windows do that o>o?
<Xatenev>	Microsoft*
<falafel>	yes
<Xatenev>	link
<Xatenev>	:P
<interop_madness>	isn't the legislation in the USA such that, were the NSA to approach a linux kernel developer to introduce an underhanded backdoor in the kernel, they are legally able to issue a gag order on said developer to ever disclose this approach? meanwhile including "hacks" like warrant canaries?
<jwpapi>	If you want to be anonym You need a good VPN ( there are not much)+ an icognito browser
<jwpapi>	and you should never go online without vpn
<Xatenev>	falafel: oh yeah im reading up on that right now
<falafel>	Xatenev, watch some talks by Richard Stallman on free software, he discusses these things. Watch CitizenFour!
<RLa>	use someone else's/public wifi if you want to be anon
<doug16k>	let them watch me. I hope they like atheist videos on you tube and SVG documentation lol
<jwpapi>	A good VPN doesnt log so there is no data and if there is no data the only option to track you is via fingerprint i would rather rc Windows then as more ppl will use windows + chrome icognito
<falafel>	RLa, it is not about wanting. Anonymity should be granted by default
<Xatenev>	doug16k: everybody says that, but its not nice to be spied
<Xatenev>	xD
<varrg>	doug16k, my point as well, let them watch me, I ain't doing shit illegally
<Xatenev>	varrg: juts not true
<Xatenev>	there are a lot of videos about it where ppl for example go at the street
<falafel>	RLa, but with the web and these nasty "apps" everywhere, is getting hard to keep your privacy
<Xatenev>	and ask people to look at their emails
<Xatenev>	EVERYBODY says no :)
<Xatenev>	would u just say yes?
<Xatenev>	cause u dont do anything illegal? I dont think so :)
<pi->	I think we're heading for #defocus, are we not? :)
<doug16k>	yeah that's what the internet is now - a big ad machine
<varrg>	Xatenev, I could say yes
<varrg>	:P
<doug16k>	track everyone, so you can show good ads
<Xatenev>	*could* :P
<jwpapi>	ok sorry i still dont get it : var tconversions = 0 ; while (  tconversions = +tconversions +conversions;)
<varrg>	jwpapi, you cast the wrong variable
<doug16k>	jwpapi, at some point, tconversions becomes undefined
<varrg>	while (tconversions = +conversions + tconversions)
<jwpapi>	tconversions += +conversions; ill try that
<doug16k>	if "conversions" is undefined, tconversions will be NaN from then on
<jwpapi>	tconversions += +conversions;
<jwpapi>	works
<jwpapi>	!
<interop_madness>	consider the OpenSSL/Heartbleed fiasco.the code relevant for this vuln was introduced by a developer who worked for T-Systems, a subsidiary of the german Telekom with known ties to NSA-affiliated companies.
<doug16k>	to "put a gun to its head" and totally force to a number, 0 for "bad" inputs, use (+thing || 0)
<ljharb>	b> +Symbol('haha') || 0
<babelbot>	ljharb: 0
<doug16k>	+undefined becomes NaN. NaN is falsy, so it evaluates right side. result = 0
<ljharb>	fail, babel
<ljharb>	that should throw.
<jwpapi>	I have one basic question. Im currently learning i a lot of JS and I was starting with codecombat and one recommendation there was : A major mistake of coders is, that they optimize their code to early. Is this true? I have sometimes the feeling that I know should clean up my code before i procede a new part
<ljharb>	jwpapi: "clean up" and "optimize" are often the opposite.
<falafel>	interop_madness, if that is true, still makes free software infinitely more secure than privative software
<varrg>	jwpapi, early optimization slows productivity
<interop_madness>	there is a strong demand on the part of intelligence organizations to subvert software infrastructure and plant backdoors. linux cannot be trusted, not more or less than windows in that regard. true, the code may be audited, but as the Underhanded C contests show, carefully introduced backdoors very probably will slip through the cracks
<doug16k>	interop_madness, " probably will slip through the cracks"  [citation needed]
<ljharb>	lol
<jwpapi>	buf if i can fe make 2 for loops to one i should do that right away to make a cleaner picture
<elvis4526>	why when using window.open("") in a js chrome console, I can't do window.opener.close() in the new opened window
<ljharb>	elvis4526: what's "window.opener"
<elvis4526>	(to close the parent window)
<interop_madness>	the whole discussion is moot. the legislation allows for the NSA to subvert software and to force stakeholders to be quiet about it. software in general is not to be trusted as long as this legislation exists. period.
<elvis4526>	it's the window object representing the parent window
<falafel>	interop_madness, the whole process is much more difficult, the bribe somebody into doing this and being so sneaky to pass the audits of projects like the kernel, it is hard, and not very likely Id say
<ljharb>	ah, weird.
<elvis4526>	it says in the parent window:
<ljharb>	elvis4526: why would the child window be able to close the parent window?
<ljharb>	opening new windows on a user is rude anyways
<elvis4526>	'Scripts may close only the windows that were opened by it.'
<doug16k>	yeah, new windows are so 1998
<ljharb>	right
<ljharb>	the parent can close the child
<ljharb>	the child can't close the parent.
<interop_madness>	doug16k, Heartbleed was introduced 2011 and discovered 3 years later. that constitutes "slipping through the cracks"
<ljharb>	because the child didn't open the parent.
<elvis4526>	I'm trying to implement login with Twitter
<falafel>	yeah, it is all about modals now, we replaced ugly windows, with custom ones, yay!
<ljharb>	interop_madness: yes but that wasn't intentionally introduced
<ljharb>	interop_madness: and the burden of proof there is that it *was*, not that it wasn't.
<elvis4526>	well, if I do window.open("") from the parent window, I expect that this would is considered the one who opened it.
<doug16k>	interop_madness, because of, or in spite of it being open source? who reviews 90% of the code on a windows box? nobody at all
<elvis4526>	from a window*
<interop_madness>	falafel, nonsense. they force someone to introduce a vuln and put a gag order upon them not to discose that approach.
<doug16k>	I'll take any reviews over none anyday
<ljharb>	elvis4526: the parent window is the one that opened the child, yes.
<ljharb>	elvis4526: so, the parent window can close the child.
<zap0>	i have some JS that i load via ajax as raw text.    how do i add it to the DOM as js?    my attempts have failed :(
<ljharb>	interop_madness: they've never been proven to do that.
<elvis4526>	They should change their warning if you're right
<ljharb>	interop_madness: and again, the burden of proof is to prove that they *have*.
<interop_madness>	ljharb, what makes you say that it wasn't intentionally introduced?
<ljharb>	elvis4526:  'Scripts may close only the windows that were opened by it.'
<elvis4526>	Well that's not true
<ljharb>	elvis4526: that says, "scripts may close only the windows that it opened"
<elvis4526>	yes
<ljharb>	elvis4526: which is true. parents can close children. children can't close parents.
<falafel>	they are well behaved children
<ljharb>	interop_madness: i don't know for sure. but, until it's proven to HAVE been intentionally introduced, then it likely wasn't.
<elvis4526>	okay...
<ljharb>	interop_madness: but it's also insanely unlikely.
<interop_madness>	ljharb, the burden of proof does not apply here. this is no trial. my point is that software in general cannot be trusted as long as legislation exists that allows the NSA to subvert any software at will without the developers being allowed to disclose that.
<ljharb>	burden of proof applies in any scenario. it has to do with logic, not law.
<interop_madness>	and my argument is logically sound
<doug16k>	interop_madness, if I claim to be able to levitate, do you have to disprove it? no, the burden of proof is on me
<ljharb>	interop_madness: ok, then go live in a cave with richard stallman. what's your point
<ljharb>	it's really not logically sound
<ljharb>	because "disclosure" isn't the only, or even the most likely, way that a vuln will be caught.
<falafel>	http://rms.sexy
<interop_madness>	1.for software which is to be trusted, it is necessary that the process of development is trustworthy
<ljharb>	and it's far more likely that a bug will accidentally be introduced and missed, then that someone would intentionally put one in and not have it caught by audits.
<ljharb>	interop_madness: ok so again, what is your point
<ljharb>	interop_madness: if you're right, then turn off your computer this instant
<ljharb>	if you're wrong, then why are we talking about this
<interop_madness>	2. NSA allows to interfere with the development process such that devs may be forced to introduce vulns AND keep quiet about it
<interop_madness>	3. therefore the development process is not to be trusted
<ljharb>	ok, so turn off your computer
<ljharb>	the nsa is listening
<ljharb>	paranoia is just silly.
<interop_madness>	my point is that any argument on "FOSS > closed source in terms of security" has been smashed by the NSA
<varrg>	NSA works for our safety, we should blindly trust them. Relax.
<doug16k>	the nsa probably has an irc client
<ljharb>	interop_madness: no, because WE CAN AUDIT IT
<ljharb>	interop_madness: closed source has the same problem, but we can't audit it.
<doug16k>	the nsa probably watches #javascript :D
<ljharb>	so that argument still ALWAYS applies, no matter what NSA laws exist.
<pi->	doug16k: do you think they would find any evidence of JavaScript related discussion :p
<interop_madness>	ljharb, still, both are not to be trusted
<ljharb>	the possibility that something will "slip through the cracks" doesn't diminish the value of auditing.
<ljharb>	nothing's to be trusted completely. ever.
<doug16k>	pi-, they have supercomputers big enough to find evidence of anything they please :D
<ljharb>	even quantum variation could (and does) flip bits in your RAM. that's what error-checking memory is for.
<ljharb>	so, again, what is your point? to what end are we having this silly discussion?
<ksmth>	interop_madness you can't trust any software / hardware you haven't assembled / built yourself, so what's the point of this argument?
<ljharb>	your only options are a) turn off your computer and stay off the grid like john connor, b) go vote and get into politics and change the laws, c) stop being paranoid and just chill
<interop_madness>	paranoia is an irrational fear. nothing what i stated was based on irrational fear.
<ljharb>	a's crazy and b is hard.
<ksmth>	voting and being vocal isn't hard at all ;)
<ljharb>	it's pretty irrational.
<varrg>	interop_madness, if you mean that the world is unfair, then yes, it is, not a news
<ksmth>	no, it's not irrational. given the recent events, it's completely rational to assume, that everything that is possible to subvert security is being done
<ljharb>	it's irrational to assume that auditable open source would have let so many things "slip through the cracks" that i can't think of any cases of proven NSA-introduced back doors.
<ljharb>	oh, i'm sure they're trying. but the "gag order" part isn't really the issue.
*	itscassa|away is now known as itscassa
<thedonut>	Hello, I'm using jQuery inview (https://github.com/protonet/jquery.inview) and want to use it to fade in LI's each, as they are visible, I've got it working on all of them, but not individually http://pastebin.com/HPhvYfLz
<ljharb>	even without a gag order, they could still pay someone off or threaten their safety/freedom.
<ksmth>	it's part of the issue. the whole concept of spying is the issue.
<interop_madness>	they are very likely trying, yes. and i contend that Heartbleed was a try.
<varrg>	thedonut, #jquery
<ljharb>	thedonut: ask in #jquery
<interop_madness>	and now, i need lunch.
<ljharb>	interop_madness: and that's a totally wild theory, and as such, requires a preponderance of evidence.
<ljharb>	and also, is utterly irrelevant in a javascript room
<varrg>	murphy's law is the proof
<thedonut>	Thanks, sorry.
<varrg>	in some parallell universe
<ljharb>	heartbleed (or maybe another one, i forget) was just some developer who failed to put curly braces on a conditional block
<ksmth>	maybe, maybe not
<ljharb>	oh wait, that's another one
<ljharb>	ah that was the gotofail one
<hipsterslapfight>	heartbleed was unsafe memory access
<hipsterslapfight>	thanks c
<ljharb>	right
<ksmth>	the point is, you don't know. no one knows how something got introduced. it could be either way and that's the whole point, I guess
<ksmth>	point point … lot's of points
<ljharb>	sure. but occam's razor.
<ksmth>	you choose one thing because of that, but it doesn't make it any more likely.
<ljharb>	no, occam's razor is a principle to help you figure out what's actually more likely. not just to pick one.
<ljharb>	it's saying that, given two things that seem equally likely, the simpler one is more likely to be more likely.
<ljharb>	and a conspiracy + gag order + nobody noticed an intentional bug is far less likely than "a programmer made an oopsie", as any programmer knows.
<varrg>	but then again
<varrg>	just because you're paranoid doesn't mean nsa hasn't put a gag order on Torvalds
<ljharb>	lol
<ljharb>	not even the nsa can make torvalds shut up
<ljharb>	he doesn't stop running his mouth for anyone
<ksmth>	ljharb: I could argue the same thing. it's far more likely a highly security concious programmer was pressured to introduce a vulnerability rather than being sloppy
*	Spr0cket- is now known as Spr0cket
<varrg>	ksmth, according to Occums Razor, that is less likely
<varrg>	because it's complicated
<varrg>	+more
<ljharb>	ksmth: also it's not just that part, it's that *nobody noticed an intentional bug*
<ljharb>	ksmth: also, the developer who did it wasn't even from or in the US.
<ljharb>	so, an NSA gag order wouldn't apply to a foreign national living in their home country.
<ljharb>	(i should have figured that part out back at the beginning of that person's rant)
<ljharb>	ok, so, glad we're done with that craziness.
<ksmth>	ljharb: it doesn't prove anything - that's the whole point. you choose occams razor as some kind of proof. but before snowden everyone was like … yeah, sure … they'd never do that. they wouldn't have the resources to do that etc.
<vileRaisin>	before snowden there were a lot of people warning about the NSA
<ksmth>	yeah, and they were regarded as the crazy tin foil people
<vileRaisin>	yep, and also we didn't understand the scope
<ljharb>	happening to be right doesn't mean they weren't crazy tin foil people.
<vileRaisin>	because the NSA were lying
<vileRaisin>	etc.
<varrg>	anyhow, the government is sterilizing the population through vaccinations to evade over population in 100 years

<javascript157>	Hi :-)
<javascript157>	I want to pass dynamically an infinit number of parameter's value to a function's call
<javascript157>	How can i do that ?
<ankr>	javascript157 call() or apply()
<ankr>	!apply
<javascript157>	Example. call(param1, param2 blabla)
<javascript157>	ok tx:)
<ankr>	javascript157 remember that the first argument to call/apply is the thisArg for the function call.
<ankr>	The rest are the actual arguments
<javascript157>	ankr: but
<javascript157>	ankr: how i'll use these functions ??
<javascript157>	ankr: because the parameters are infinite ,so i can't use array
<varrg>	javascript157, an infinite data structure?
<ankr>	>> var f = function (arg) { console.log(this, arg); }; f.call({foo:'bar'}, 123);
<ecmabot>	ankr: undefined; Console: {foo: 'bar'}, 123
<varrg>	show me
<javascript157>	var new_super_type = new Super_Type(first_select_sub_type.getTitle() + operations_select_text + last_select_sub_type.getTitle(), 		["Résultat de l'opération", first_select_sub_type.getTitle(), last_select_sub_type.getTitle()], "miaou", "miaou2", "miaou3");
<javascript157>	varrg: , ankr : consider the last arguments
<javascript157>	varrg: ankr : (don't read the 2 fist arguments in fact)
<javascript157>	first*
<javascript157>	ankr: it can work
<javascript157>	ankr: it can't work
<javascript157>	varrg: ankr : so the infinite args are not the two first args, but the oters "miaou "miaou2" "miaou3" etc
<Dev1156>	Hi. I want to crunch canvas data with a web worker and having trouble getting Transferable to work. It looks like the actual ImageData is not transferable by itself but only the underlying ArrayBuffer. How do I use this?  http://plnkr.co/edit/8uD3s6Kf21nfXkYBQ5TF?p=info why is the buffer empty *before* sending it to the worker but filled inside the worker?
<javascript157>	varrg: ankr : and i have to create a looot of miaou...
<varrg>	javascript157, still I doubt it'll be infinite
<javascript157>	varrg: ?
<varrg>	your argument list
<javascript157>	varrg: it's infinite ;.
<varrg>	in what sense?
<javascript157>	varrg: from the two first parameters (note included) , you can add miaou4, miaou5n miaouX
<vileRaisin>	?  fn.apply(this, [].slice.call(arguments))
<javascript157>	varrg: so the function has an infinite number of param
<javascript157>	vileRaisin: mmmmmh
<varrg>	javascript157, once it's executed, the list is finite
<varrg>	so an array is fine
<vileRaisin>	arguments is an object that contains all arguments passed
<javascript157>	varrg: i don't want to use arrays :-)
<javascript157>	varrg: i only want "miaou1, miaou2" and not "[miaou1, miaou2]"
<varrg>	javascript157, why not?
<varrg>	why do you care?
<javascript157>	varrg: because [] = two chars added :O
<javascript157>	varrg: so it takes more time
<varrg>	internally "foo, bar" is an array anyway
<varrg>	javascript157, oh boy...
<javascript157>	varrg: ...
<vileRaisin>	function foo( a,b,c ) { console.log(a,b,c) }; function bar(){ foo.apply( null, [].slice.call(arguments) ) }
<varrg>	javascript157, good luck in life
<javascript157>	varrg:  x
<javascript157>	varrg:  xD
<javascript157>	vileRaisin: hmm
<vileRaisin>	I don't understand your problem javascript157
<varrg>	he doesn't want to use an array
<vileRaisin>	what do you mean
<vileRaisin>	arguments is not an array
<vileRaisin>	try that line
<vileRaisin>	copy paste
<vileRaisin>	do bar( 1 , 2 , 3  )
<javascript157>	vileRaisin: are you sure ?
<javascript157>	I can re-explain my problem
<vileRaisin>	alright
<varrg>	in either way, he wants to omit the first 2 arguments, so he has to cast it to array
<varrg>	javascript157, your solution is to use apply and fill an array of arguments that you pass with apply
<javascript157>	So, consider this line : new Michele ("hey", ["oh", "uh"], 1, 2 ,3 ,4 ,5 ,6);
<varrg>	and get rid of your 2 character save idea
<javascript157>	the two first args are a string and then an array.
<javascript157>	the others args are string or number or arrays, etc
<javascript157>	and I made a treatment that analyses them
<javascript157>	(them = the args from the two first ones)
*	erste is now known as erste-away
<javascript157>	varrg: i don't understand :O
<vileRaisin>	and what are you trying to do that you have a problem with?
*	erste-away is now known as erste
<javascript157>	vileRaisin: i need to give the "from the two first args" args'value, but not in the constructor'call
<javascript157>	so it will be for example :
<javascript157>	var a =new Michel("hey", ["truc"], -1) ;   a.setData(1,2,3,4,5,6)
<vileRaisin>	exactly what I said javascript
<javascript157>	which is equivalent to : new Michel("hey", ["truc"], 1,2,3,4,5,6)
<javascript157>	vileRaisin: ah ? :D
<vileRaisin>	setData.apply( null, [].slice.call( arguments, 2 ) )
<javascript157>	vileRaisin: in the [], i put the values ?
<vileRaisin>	no
<javascript157>	where do i put htem ? x)
<vileRaisin>	ok listen
<vileRaisin>	apply, allows you to pass an array as a list of arguments
<javascript157>	vileRaisin: you can speak french if you want
<vileRaisin>	so [1,2,3] is equivalent to foo(1,2,3)
<vileRaisin>	I don't know french
<javascript157>	vileRaisin: you pseudo is french ^^
<vileRaisin>	what you're doing is, you're using the arguments object, all functions have this by default

<vileRaisin>	[].slice.call( arguments ) means you're calling the array function slice, but the this becomes arguments
<vileRaisin>	so that's honestly all you need
<vileRaisin>	setData.apply( null, [].slice.call( arguments, 2 ) )
<javascript157>	ok thanks :p can i replace [] by Array ?
<javascript157>	Array.slice
<javascript157>	instead of [].slice ?
<vileRaisin>	on setdata, apply an array as argument list (comma seperated), supply arguments as the array, and start at the index 2
<vileRaisin>	no
<hipsterslapfight>	no it needs to be []
<vileRaisin>	just do it like that, arguments is not an array
<hipsterslapfight>	Array.prototype.slice is also allowed ... iirc?
<vileRaisin>	yeah
<falafel>	>>[].slice===Array.prototype.slice
<ecmabot>	falafel: (boolean) true
<vileRaisin>	or maybe even (Array()).slice
<vileRaisin>	but haven't tried

<jwpapi>	Im using the same method but its not working
<jwpapi>	var tcosts = 0 ;var cost = row['Cost'];
<jwpapi>	    tcosts += +cost;
<jwpapi>	var tcosts = 0 ;while (){var cost = row['Cost'];    tcosts += +cost;}
<vileRaisin>	tcosts = +tcosts + costs
<jwpapi>	tcosts is still NAN
<vileRaisin>	or tcosts = tcosts + +costs
<vileRaisin>	if tcosts is NaN, either one of those is not a primitive type
<vileRaisin>	string or number
<vileRaisin>	so cost could be an object or array for instance
<jwpapi>	var tconversions = 0 ; while(){    tconversions += +conversions;}
<jwpapi>	works
<vileRaisin>	maybe because they are both numbers
<jwpapi>	i put the numbers in a sheet and there they are numbers
<vileRaisin>	var cost = row['Cost'];
<vileRaisin>	what doest row['cost'] return
<jwpapi>	3252.35 fe
<vileRaisin>	I would avoid += +cost though, I've had this still concat strings for some reason
<jwpapi>	im using the same with conversions but it dont ork
<jwpapi>	work
<vileRaisin>	fe?
<jwpapi>	for example
<jwpapi>	with conversions it works
<jwpapi>	http://pastebin.com/2LWnPih2
<vileRaisin>	try parseFloat( cost )
<jwpapi>	still nan
<jwpapi>	but if i make tcosts = cost;
<jwpapi>	it returns the last cost

<bberry>	This example was taking from an mdn blurb talking about closures/memory leaks. https://jsfiddle.net/9bfjbtyr/ Could someone explain to me why in the addHandler function, the clickHandler function itself isnt leaked memory?
<bberry>	i guess its because the iife is just executed and so its scope gets gc'ed when its finished?
<xqo>	why does my function to make a String an array of CharacterCodes break JSFiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/rro86bjx/
<xqo>	this is the source: https://bpaste.net/show/e7709160c43b
<ksmth>	values is global?
<ksmth>	no, it's an infinite loop
<ksmth>	line 5
<ksmth>	i < values.length
<bberry>	actually, i guess its not a "memory leak" per se, because you want the clickHandler to stay around in memory, otherwise the function to-be-executed on a click wouldn exist haha. derp.
<xqo>	oh right, thank you
<inimino>	bberry: also, the iife there is 100% useless and unnecessary
<bberry>	inimino: yes, i was thinking that as well. for some reason, MDN set it up that way. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript#Memory_leaks
<hipsterslapfight>	ugh, can't remember what the recommended way is to get a new array of certain length given that length
<inimino>	it literally has no effect besides making the code longer and slower
<inimino>	js> Array(20)
<ecmabot>	inimino: (object) [undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined]
<inimino>	or a=[]; a.length=20
<ksmth>	inimino: no, not true
<hipsterslapfight>	inimino: ... oh duh
<inimino>	hipsterslapfight: but it won't have any elements in it, of course
<ksmth>	inimino: by putting the `var el` into the closure, it will not leak memory
<GreenJello>	hipsterslapfight, the only problem with that approach is your array has no keys
<GreenJello>	so you can't .map, etc. on it
<hipsterslapfight>	oh :/ well that's what i need
<GreenJello>	in es6 it's Array(20).fill(undefined)
<inimino>	ksmth: that's actually not true
<ksmth>	inimino: as the article clearly states "It also creates a memory leak. Why? Because the reference to el is inadvertently caught in the closure created for the anonymous inner function. This creates a circular reference between a JavaScript object (the function) and a native object (el)."
<inimino>	ksmth: but I see the MDN reference and it's talking about an old IE issue
<hipsterslapfight>	GreenJello: and in ES5? that's the point i'm stuck at
<bberry>	ksmth, i think this is what inimino means: https://jsfiddle.net/9bfjbtyr/2/
<hipsterslapfight>	i know i see it here almost weekly but i never wrote it down thinking i wouldn't need it but now i do
<GreenJello>	hipsterslapfight, there's some hack with split/join, but I don't remember it
<inimino>	ksmth: that's all explicitly and only in the context of old IE versions

<ticktick>	hi, any difference between func = function(){} and function func() {}  ?
<inimino>	ticktick: yes, the second one is better
<ticktick>	why?
<inimino>	hoisting, and it's more natural
<ticktick>	hoisting?
<inimino>	and you don't need an extraneous var statement
<inimino>	f(); function f(){}
<inimino>	that's hoisting
<inimino>	the only reason function expressions exist is so you can use them for things like foo.bar=function(){}
<ticktick>	inimino: ok, but doesn't var func = function get hoisted as well?
<inimino>	using var foo = function(){} is just bad style
<inimino>	no, how could it?
<inimino>	it's an assignment statement, it runs when it runs
<ticktick>	inimino: ah, i though the var decl was moved to the top despite the assignment
<ticktick>	then i get the difference
<ticktick>	thanks!
<inimino>	the var does
<inimino>	but not the assignment

<ticktick>	i like types, just not sure i like them when doing small scripts :)
<ticktick>	esp the extra compile step
<ticktick>	but hey, let's try
<inimino>	a lot better looking than TypeScript IMO
<hipsterslapfight>	it is yes
<inimino>	if you're doing small scripts it's probably not for you
<hipsterslapfight>	also the compile steps are all invisible anyway, if you're doing it right
<inimino>	but having a build step lets you do other nice things like use ES6
<ticktick>	dart compiles to js too, right?
<hipsterslapfight>	i just spin up browserify/watchify with the various transforms it needs
<hipsterslapfight>	ticktick: dart is pretty much EOL
<ticktick>	ah
<hipsterslapfight>	google has stopped using it and also stopped supporting their editor they had
<hipsterslapfight>	they say it's not EOL of course, but it might as well be at this point

<jwpapi>	i already know how to do thanks
<jwpapi>	sorry for the question
<ankr>	inimino If you get that error it's a sign of bad design imo (not personal). And why construct a function if it's never used?
<inimino>	jwpapi: it's just that we can't answer it, you should probably check the API docs instead
<ticktick>	say i have a long-running javascript that periodically evaluates other scripts. I need the root script to be as robust as possible and not die if the eval'ed script does something bad... is it enough to try/catch around the eval, or do i need more, or is there no way to be absolute sure :)
<ankr>	And hoisting is just non-intuitive imo. It makes sense that a function is only available after you've declared it.
<jwpapi>	tu build a for loop should be a good solution
<hipsterslapfight>	jwpapi: no it wouldn't
<jwpapi>	so making an array with the numbers and then just for loop
<hipsterslapfight>	an iterator would be a good solution
<inimino>	ankr: constructing a function costs nothing, why would it have any performance impact at all?
<jwpapi>	whats an iterator?
<inimino>	ticktick: it's completely impossible
<ticktick>	i see
<inimino>	ticktick: use a web worker
<ticktick>	inimino: this is non-browser scripting
<inimino>	ticktick: then use whatever equivalent you have to run in a separate thread/process
<ticktick>	right
<Alfio>	ok
<hipsterslapfight>	jwpapi: forEach/map/etc, in this case you'd want `forEach` though, as inimino said above
<jwpapi>	ok ill try
<inimino>	ankr: I find it intuitive and also very handy for making code shorter and clearer
<jwpapi>	sounds good
<inimino>	ticktick: where does the code come from?
<ankr>	inimino I guess we will not agree then. I find it confusing that you can use a function that you haven't seen yet because it's declared in the bottom of your scope.
<ticktick>	inimino: it's a java process loading them into a nashorn engine
<ticktick>	inimino: and this script in turn load other scripts, but i guess i can have mutiple engines
<ankr>	So in that case I think function statements should always be put in the top of the scope, and in that case you might as well use expressions.

<bkaliszuk>	Hello, is this a place where I can ask how some effect on some page is achieved? There is this cool-scrolling thingy here: http://madebytung.com/projects/tung-stationery at the very bottom which I'm not able to locate from the sources/debugger...

*	zz_robotmayo is now known as robotmayo
<inimino>	ticktick: I mean what is the source of the code, does it come from users or something?
<bkaliszuk>	ankr: thanks. I'll check it out then.
<inimino>	ankr: if you always put them at the top anyway, then why not just use declarations? they are shorter, look like functions, and intended for just that purpose
<ticktick>	inimino: yes
<ticktick>	inimino: except the "core" script, which launches user scripts (which might do anything)
<ticktick>	inimino: the core script does scheduling, etc
<inimino>	ticktick: is this more like cron jobs or like an IDE?
*	itscassa|away is now known as itscassa
<ticktick>	kinda like cron, in that it's long-running daemons. Point is, they run user-supplied script that I don't want to tear down everything else.
<inimino>	actually even if it's cron jobs you probably want them to timeout if someone writes an infinite loop
<inimino>	yeah, so separate processes are a must
<ticktick>	sounds like it
<ticktick>	figured i'd ask, the process overhead with a java-hosted engine is substantial
<inimino>	oh, yeah
<inimino>	Java :(
<ticktick>	java works great for this, actually, as we have java-libs for everything we need - just that we script it from javascript
<ticktick>	but of course, multiple jvm's is a tad heavy still
<ankr>	inimino an example of unintended behavior http://jsfiddle.net/ankr/35udoxkx/
<ankr>	It's a bad example I know, but I've seen this in the real world and it was a bitch to debug.
<ankr>	same thing happens when declaring a function within a loop (don't ever do that though)
<inimino>	ankr: actually both of those aren't even valid as ES5
<inimino>	functions cannot appear in block statements
<inimino>	engines allow it but they all have different ideas about what it means
<inimino>	and any linter, or strict mode, should catch it

<NoiseEee>	thats news to me
<NoiseEee>	well you'll need your server configured properly

<knod>	_mouse_: apparently python stdlib can only serve one thing at a time. I wasn't clear that I was using python though, my bad.
<_mouse_>	ah.  yeah. i've been using node all over the place for mutiple awesomeness
<_mouse_>	can you run a second instance?
<ezakimak>	node? you can run as many as you want
<ezakimak>	it's just a process
<knod>	_mouse_: don't know. I should probably figure out how to do it with node
<ezakimak>	python too
<knod>	ezakimak: apparently not the with stdlib
<knod>	*not with
<ezakimak>	remind me what python's stdlib is
<knod>	ezakimak: not sure. That's just what the people at #python are telling me
<ezakimak>	um, isn't that just the name for python's built in stuff?
<Kattkunskap>	anyone using yuidoc with es6? how do you document your constructors?
<ezakimak>	you can run as many python scripts at the same time as you want
<knod>	ezakimak: not servers though
<ezakimak>	i run multiple local web servers with python at the same time
<ezakimak>	sure you can
<Sorella>	knod: you can, you just need to bind them to different ports.
<knod>	ezakimak: They are bound to different ports
<knod>	One is 8000, one is 4443
<knod>	I meant Sorella
<ezakimak>	so what's the problem?
<knod>	ezakimak: I was told to go discuss it on #python, but I'd be happy to have further advice
<knod>	Using these instructions, I tried to run a local https server: https://www.piware.de/2011/01/creating-an-https-server-in-python/
<knod>	I went to https://localhost:4443 and got "This webpage is not available" and the error "https://localhost:4443/ Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED" in my console.
<knod>	I'm not sure what that means
<ezakimak>	wow, that's complicated.
<knod>	ezakimak: I want an https server, not just an http server
<ezakimak>	just cd /to/your/directory && python -m SimpleHTTPServer <port> &
<ezakimak>	oh.
<ezakimak>	and have you created your certificates?
*	pereba_ is now known as pereba
<knod>	ezakimak: I… don't know. The instructions don't say anything about that, so I guess I haven't.
<knod>	You need certificates for a local server?
<ezakimak>	you need certs for https
<nbt>	knod: is port 4443 correct? it's usually 443 for https
<ezakimak>	why do you want https for a local server?
<ezakimak>	port doesn't matter
<knod>	nbt: look at what the instructions say as the reason for that
<ezakimak>	port is completely arbitrary
<knod>	ezakimak: because I'm trying to test out how to make my bookmarklet work on https servers
<ezakimak>	well, it will be an incomplete test because you'll be using a self-signed cert
<ezakimak>	can you host it on your github and get https that way?
<knod>	ezakimak: I'm not sure if you can use https with your raw github, but working with raw github is painful when developing locally. Any tiny change I make has to be pushed to the repo, making a ton of commits that wouldn't be necessary locally.
<knod>	If it won't do any good, though, then it won't do any good
<cresten>	Hey what's everyone's favorite request library?
<cresten>	I'm using superagent currently but it's ANNOYING ME
<knod>	Welp, I gtg
<ezakimak>	why do you need a full library?
<knod>	More attempts next time I guess
<ezakimak>	XMLHttpRequest is pretty simple
<hipsterslapfight>	what's even more simple is `fetch`
<hipsterslapfight>	and a polyfill for those browsers that don't support it
<jaawerth>	hipsterslapfight: <3 fetch
<jaawerth>	cresten: fetch polyfill https://www.npmjs.com/package/fetch
<jaawerth>	it's lightweight, it works great, and it provides a great standard API to/from which you can convert the arguments for most other types of http/ajax call
<jaawerth>	(if you ever wanted to, say, write a library that generalizes requests away from relying on any specific http client implementation)
<jaawerth>	ezakimak: by the time you've handled edge cases, all the possible headers and content-types and things, response-parsing, cookies, etc, you'd end up having more code than a library anyway. Or worse, if you try and have a base XMLHttpRequest and handle all those things on a case-by-case basis then you'll likely end up with MORE code, less readable and consistent
<jaawerth>	ezakimak: also, if you use a module, that way it's standardized
*	knod is now known as knod_away
<jaawerth>	fetch is great because it handles the nitty gritty stuff but it's so simple that it's easy to build on
<jaawerth>	like, I wrap it for certain types of response parsing or for adding another argument for query params easily, that kind of thing
<jaawerth>	XMLHttpRequest made sense when AJAX was a once in a while thing, but now that it's the norm a clean, standard API for it makes the most sense
<dostoyevsky>	hey, is there a good way to prevent backspace problems in the browser?  Like: ignore backspace in anything other than an input or textarea
<ezakimak>	you need to look at the client side routing, and html pushstate stuff
<ezakimak>	you can intercept it and ignore it
<dostoyevsky>	ezakimak: yeah, just realized I used document.onkeypress  which is too late for backspace (now using document.onkeydown)
<dostoyevsky>	works now... one of the most annoying things in html
*	_creativename is now known as _DB
<jaawerth>	dostoyevsky: I think you have to listen for both. That said, I hope you aren't doing that globally on the page.. as a user that would infuriate me ;-)
<_mouse_>	so who uses phantom.js or casper.js?
<jaawerth>	I like using backspace as a "back" shortcut
<ezakimak>	i find it annoying and wish browser's didn't do that to me
<ezakimak>	if i want to go backwards in history i click the back button or alt-left arrow
*	oddskill_away is now known as oddskill
<dostoyevsky>	jaawerth: I do it globally because it annoys I who is the user of my page :)
<jaawerth>	I'm a fan of minimal-mouse/touchpad computer use, particularly on my laptop
<ezakimak>	i hate hitting backspace when i *thought* i was focused in a form input only to lose the page. lame.
<_mouse_>	ezakimak  i actually hate the alt-left shortcut
*	oddskill is now known as Guest5178
*	Guest5178 is now known as oddskill_away
<ezakimak>	the idea that one key changes meaning depending on focus context seems absurd to me
<jaawerth>	that's true, I suppose alt-left is standard enough that I could just get in the habit of using that
<dostoyevsky>	jaawerth: it's the same when you hit space on youtube and that shit page scrolls you down because the player lost focus
<ezakimak>	especially where the result is so radical
<jaawerth>	dostoyevsky: now THAT one is just nonsensical
<jaawerth>	we have keys for that!
<jaawerth>	haha
<ezakimak>	yay, I am not alone!
<dostoyevsky>	and in my app/page I lose all the texts I've written so far..
<dostoyevsky>	it's like: delete unsaved document
<jaawerth>	I have perfectly good page-up and page-down keys, no need to also map space to that in the browser
<ezakimak>	and death to infinite scrolling.
<ezakimak>	worse than blink tags.
<dostoyevsky>	ezakimak: infinite scrolling is mostly a mobile thing I'd say
*	oddskill_away is now known as oddskill
<jaawerth>	infinite scroll is a sometimes-necessary thing, it's just not done well very often
<ezakimak>	i've *never* seen it done well.
<jaawerth>	when it's done well you probably don't notice it ;-)
<ezakimak>	say you find something 3 miles down, how do you ever get back to it the next visit?
<ezakimak>	you can't bookmark it
<jaawerth>	anchor tags
<ezakimak>	you can't recall that it was on page 3 of 100
<ezakimak>	cause there's no pager
<dostoyevsky>	I think you need to make sure you remove the old pages, so you do not eat up all memory... but in the end you are implementing a google maps like panning logic which is quite hard to do right
<jaawerth>	IE a clickable area that will put a hash in the URL
<ezakimak>	and depending on how they layout the content it's position on the page could be shifted so that memory is useless
<jaawerth>	the infinite scrolling code parses the hash and loads that portion of the page
<ezakimak>	it's just an all around terrible UI pattern
<iaj>	Xatenev: I tried that, however - its still totally encrypted to my eyes :)
<jaawerth>	and the page should be buffered/"chunked" rather than a continuous infinite scrolling
<iaj>	Xatenev: (the js beautifier that is)
<willv2>	ezakimak: Paging doesn't make sense sometimes either...
<dostoyevsky>	is there some .js library just for paging?
<jaawerth>	yeah
<ezakimak>	sure, but that means you can't do a search-in-page to find stuff either
<jaawerth>	infinite scrolling is overused but sometimes it's the best option
<ezakimak>	there are lots of libs for paging
<dostoyevsky>	like: do paging on a screen where you have a mouse, do infinite scrolling on touch devices, be able to link to pages
<jaawerth>	ezakimak: the same stuff you'd fail to find on a search-in-page on a well-done infinite scroll is the stuff you wouldn't be able to find doing search-in-page with pagination
<jaawerth>	the solution to both is to have an active search filter
<ezakimak>	yes.
<dostoyevsky>	google uses infinite scrolling for image search but pagination for the websearch
<ezakimak>	but at least combined with paging it makes for easier retrieval
*	elgrubles is now known as grubles
<vileRaisin>	ezakimak: you could dynamically update the anchor link in the location.href
<ezakimak>	I remember things like "i used this search term and it was on the 2nd page"
<vileRaisin>	?page=12 based on how far you scrolled down
<ezakimak>	with inf. scrolling, it's "ah crap, i just scrolled an scrolled and finally found it"
<nicholas_c>	Hey, if there any way for chrome to "Steal" focus of a tab?
<jaawerth>	vileRaisin raises a good point
<ezakimak>	and what determines page size?
<nicholas_c>	e.g. when my socket.io stuff gets a certain response, autoswitch to the tab...?
<jaawerth>	there are definitely right ways to do infinite scrolling, they're just outnumbered by the bad implementations
<jaawerth>	same way you determine a default page size with pagination
<ezakimak>	like i said, i've yet to see one that works well. not that they don't exist--i just haven't seen one
<vileRaisin>	whatever determines infinite scrolling
<vileRaisin>	determines page size
<ezakimak>	it has to be n items then
<dostoyevsky>	jaawerth: Yeah, also I am not sure if the difference is that strong... infinite scroll is like normal pagination, only with a next and previous button on top/bottom
<jaawerth>	heck, you can use BOTH if you want to
<vileRaisin>	personally I feel that browsers should utilize localstorage better for infinite scrolling
<vileRaisin>	I see more and more websites smartening up concerning where to return to on an infinite scroll page
<dostoyevsky>	Personally, I'd like to not autoload the next page on scroll down because sometimes people look for contact details on the bottom of a page which is annoying if you are unable to scroll down
<vileRaisin>	soundcloud has fixed that issue for a year or so now
<jaawerth>	yeah, it works much better if you preload/cache the data in "chunks"
<vileRaisin>	but if it's also in localstorage, you can return to it even after losing session
<ezakimak>	yeah, inf scroll destroys footer access. i've seen lots of sites where you can't get to their contact links anymore
<jaawerth>	well, that's just bad design
<ezakimak>	it's actually laughable to me
<jaawerth>	if you want infinite scroll, either don't use a footer or make the scrollable portion end before the footer
<ezakimak>	kinda like those old windows joke apps where it'd popup an alert and the button to close it would run away from the mouse
<hipsterslapfight>	vileRaisin: soundcloud do a lot of clever stuff with pushstate et al, they're definitely pushing things in the right area
<dostoyevsky>	google is actually organized that way... you go on google.com, search for something you find help on the bottom of each page... if you are on a result page of google images, what do you find on the bottom of the page?  you do not know because it's scrolling infinitely, even though the scrollbar indicates that the pages is not that long
<Alfio3>	ok google
<dostoyevsky>	but actually: help link is still on the bottom of each page on google images
<ezakimak>	so, unreachable?
<ezakimak>	or do you just have scroll get past every image in the world first?
<Sorella>	It stops after 3 pages or so IIRC
<ezakimak>	that's not infinite scrolling then
<jaawerth>	a better word for the technique is "virtual scrolling" IMO
<Sorella>	ezakimak: it isn't https://sc-cdn.scaleengine.net/i/096758667ecad76057249301a0ef3b75.png
*	zz_robotmayo is now known as robotmayo
<dostoyevsky>	maybe scrolling should be directly handled in html via the browser

<Ron4ldinho>	why stateSave setting form datatables plugin doesnt work in chrome?
<Ron4ldinho>	why stateSave setting from* datatables plugin doesnt work in chrome?
<jaawerth>	matthavard: unless the page is sending the info via AJAX or something, yeah
<matthavard>	Actually I guess not beause the client can def see the fragment, and they could read the fragment and send that to the server
<jaawerth>	hashes don't get sent to the server
<jaawerth>	but you can't account fort client-side code
<ezakimak>	they shouldn't get sent, but some broken browser or js code could
<Sorella>	Well, nothing preventing you from making an HTTP request to that url

<_mouse_>	cyberspace009 it double checks that something exists
<cyberspace009>	thank you
<inimino>	"double check" is a funny way of saying it
<_mouse_>	well... it equals itself, unless "itself" doesnt exists
<inimino>	right
<inimino>	unless it had a falsy value
<hipsterslapfight>	cyberspace009: does it really have `var` there?
<hipsterslapfight>	because that is wrong
<azanc>	Hi everyone, i need a help about JS conflicts , here details http://pastebin.com/MnYi0x0W (reply with my name if i was not clear enough
<inimino>	!falsy
<ecmabot>	inimino: The 'falsy' values in JavaScript are undefined, null, 0, -0, NaN, '', and false. The 'truthy' values are all other values. All objects are truthy. There is nothing both truthy and falsy, or neither truthy nor falsy.
<cyberspace009>	hipsterslapfight: here is full code: http://hastebin.com/oriyajusuv.cs
<inimino>	hipsterslapfight: why is it wrong?
<cyberspace009>	I am trying to understand this style :)
<cyberspace009>	this style is new to me in javascript.
<hipsterslapfight>	inimino: well, maybe not "wrong" but most linters will complain about that
<hipsterslapfight>	it's a pointless use of var
<_mouse_>	inimino if you have gto declare it, it doesnt exist
<cyberspace009>	so Input = Input || {}
<inimino>	not pointless if you don't know whether or not something has been imported

<hipsterslapfight>	oh god i see the code now, ugh why aren't we all using browserify
<cyberspace009>	can anyone explain this style of javascript?
<inimino>	it's a library
<inimino>	the var is required
<cyberspace009>	Ah, so its a library that can be called anytime?
<inimino>	well, not strictly required, but whatever
<inimino>	maybe this is supposed to be concatenated with some other files that add Input.mouse, etc
<iaj>	Hi there if I check for indexOf(symbol)==-1  I check that the symbol is NOT included, right?
<inimino>	or included separately
<inimino>	iaj: assuming that's the array method
<Fenikkusu>	cyberspace009, something = something || {} is equivilant to if (!something) { something = {};}
<cyberspace009>	That I understand but the syle is different to me look at this paste: http://hastebin.com/oriyajusuv.cs
<Fenikkusu>	The style is Object Literals
<cyberspace009>	thanks
<Fenikkusu>	In terms of other languages, its similar to having static classes.
<inimino>	x=x||y is a common idiom
<iaj>	inimino: thanks
<cyberspace009>	so object literals are used mostly to make librarys/api in javascript.
<cyberspace009>	*libraries
<inimino>	no...
<jaawerth>	they're used across the board for constructing relatively simple objects
<Fenikkusu>	cyberspace009, no, it's just one of the many Design Patterns used.
<azanc>	Anyone read my 5:28 message?
<hipsterslapfight>	Design Patterns Considered Harmful™
<jaawerth>	often a function that returns an object literal is all you need, rather than a constructor function
<Fenikkusu>	hipsterslapfight, ?
<cyberspace009>	ok. It is very useful. Thank you for the design pattern identification.
<hipsterslapfight>	Fenikkusu: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DesignPatternsConsideredHarmful
<hipsterslapfight>	i feel obliged to bring it up every time somebody mentions design patterns :v

<inimino>	azanc: what I meant was that for people not in your time zone, 5:28 isn't the right time
<NoiseEee>	https://api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict/ @ azanc / #jquery
<Fenikkusu>	hipsterslapfight, I can see where the question comes from. However, I think that the question is the result of many people jumping on the Design Pattern train without truely understanding the underlying logic behind design pattern. Each pattern has it's place, and more often than not many people end up using the wrong one for the job. IE: Singleton. I love the singleton pattern, but the
<Fenikkusu>	singleton pattern also breaks SOLID code. The real question is probably 'What Design Patterns are well placed within SOLID code'.
<inimino>	;)
<azanc>	NoiseEee: ty , but i’m really a newbie, this could be a matter of minutes for coders. it’s since Monday that I read official docs +examples on eg: stackoverflow but i did not succeed =/ ..
<azanc>	the fact is that in jsfiddle it work but not in my site (that has other JS i cannot delete)

<intellix>	possible to return a string from a function on a property access?
<intellix>	if I do something like: var a = (function() { return new Date().toString() }());
<intellix>	it's only evaluated once
<Fenikkusu>	You want to lazyload the property?
<cyberspace009>	the design pattern i posted was not object literals. it was Static Namespacing
<cyberspace009>	https://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/12/07/namespacing-in-javascript/
<inimino>	no, he wants a getter
<Fenikkusu>	lol. Static Namespacing are Object Literals, though Object Literals Aren't Always Static Namespacing
<inimino>	intellix: but why would you want that?
<cyberspace009>	ok. Making sure lol
<inimino>	and that's not a property, so I don't know what you want exactly

<intellix>	yeah, lazyload a property
<Torqable>	?
<modman>	thats it lol
<intellix>	fine :P var o = { a: (function() { return new Date().toString() }()); };
<Torqable>	I'm so good at this
<inimino>	intellix: ok, now why do you want that?
<inimino>	it's called a "getter"
<intellix>	the property eventually becomes private and I want to change it's value later
<inimino>	that doesn't mean anything to me
<Fenikkusu>	Sounds like he wants a public const.
<Alfio_>	hello javascript

<rogi>	in IE9, trying to set height on window.frameElement but style is null there, (iframe resizing itself, on same domain)
<rogi>	help me #js, you're my only hope!
<rogi>	let me rephrase, whats a compatible way to have an iframe resize itself to its content?
<Fenikkusu>	...not use iframe and use a modal instead?
<rogi>	oh I forgot, graybeards are on efnet #js
<Sorella>	rogi: if the iframe is in the same domain, compute the size of the iframe by polling (which is not trivial), and resize it. It not, it's even worse, because you'll need to modify the code in the iframe to pass messages to the parent page indicating its new size, so the parent page can react accordingly.
<Sorella>	Also, that last message was rude and unnecessary.
<TorvusBug>	o.0
<rogi>	you're saying frameElement.style is not exposed in ie9?
<Sorella>	(Also, what Fenikkusu suggested makes sense, if you can do that)
<rogi>	I cant
<Sorella>	`style` is present in every element, in every engine. The problem is both computing the correct size of the iframe and being unable to do that when said frame is in another domain (due to security policies)
<Sorella>	!csp
<ecmabot>	Sorella: Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security to detect/mitigate certain attacks, including XSS and data injection. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/CSP

See also: !jsonp, !cors.

<mindstorm8191>	afternoon everyone
<diphtherial>	hey, i'm having some trouble understanding what's going on in this d3.js code: https://github.com/mbostock/d3/blob/master/src/interpolate/uninterpolate.js
<diphtherial>	what does that line in the first function, b = (b -= a = +a) || 1 / b; mean?
<diphtherial>	i'm assuming that it's setting b to either b-a (after casting a to number) or if that's false (i.e. 0) it sets it to 1/b?
<diphtherial>	is this normal javascript practice?
<diphtherial>	i mean, bostock is genius, but i think he sacrificed clarity for brevity here...
<diphtherial>	maybe i'm just too dumb to not be able to consider this 'self-documenting code'
<Torqable>	that's some janky looking code
*	diphtherial shrugs
<diphtherial>	i have a lot of respect for d3.js; the user-facing part is brilliant
<diphtherial>	(by 'user-facing', i mean the library functions and documentation, not the end result)
<Obbs>	changing the variable, "this" inside a function: "if you just do something.forEach(function(el){ inside here, this well NOT be something, it will just be an empty scope})"
<Obbs>	Why would I want to do that? and how would I do that?
<Torqable>	I don't know what an "empty scope" is but don't change `this`
<Obbs>	inside an anonymous function being called by foreach, what would this point to in that situation?
<Obbs>	would it point to the function, or the list/array that foreach was called on? or the individual item spit out by the foreach?
<Torqable>	this is always the object that called the function
<Torqable>	no it will not be the items
<Obbs>	so in the case of: "if you just do something.forEach(function(el){ inside here, this well NOT be something, it will just be an empty scope})", it would be the, "something" object?
<diphtherial>	d3.js is really starting to annoy me...things like this abound: while (--i >= 0 && !(f = d3.interpolators[i](a, b)));
<diphtherial>	while loop whose sole purpose is side effects in the condition? why not?
<rogi>	Obbs: no, this is trivial to test, why don't you try logging this?
<Torqable>	no, it depends on where that forEach is happening
<Torqable>	something is not calling that function
<Torqable>	callbacks are tricky when it comes to `this`
<Torqable>	not really a callback I guess
<Torqable>	higher level function calls make it tricky I would say
<Obbs>	sorry, I haven't started learning javascript really yet, just someone said that, 'this' is assigned to frequently in javascript and it irked me
<Obbs>	So before I went to bed, I wanted to figure it out, I'll do as rogi suggested and try to log it
<Obbs>	Thanks much Torqable

<matthavard>	 I've defined a function `var gebi = document.getElementById.bind(document)` so that I don't have to write out document.getElementById all the time, but according to jsperf.com, `gebi` is a lot slower than `document.getElementById`.  Is there a way I can still save the typing but keep the speed?
<Perseus0>	thought so too
<Perseus0>	but i need to be able to call the cmd

<mmmveggies>	what about `var gebi = function(id) { return document.getElementById(id) } ?
<rogi>	var gebi = document.getElementById;
<matthavard>	rogi... If I do `var gebi = document.getElementById` and then `gebi("foo")` I get "Illegal Invocation"
<matthavard>	but it works fine if it's bound to document
<rogi>	sure thats not a console quirk?
<matthavard>	mmmveggies: Wow that actuallly beat out document.getElementById.  Just by a margin of error.

<EllisTAA>	if value is a move up if value b move down
<ezakimak>	huh?

<mmmveggies>	why would you want to sort an object
<mmmveggies>	maybe there is an alternative solution to your problem
<ezakimak>	!xy @ EllisTAA
<ecmabot>	EllisTAA: The XY problem: You want to do X, but don't know how. You think you can solve it using Y, but don't know how to do that either. You ask about Y, which is a strange thing to want to do. Just ask about X.
<bewl>	you can certainly sort an array of objects by an objects property
<doc|work>	this is why I always go with Z
<Synthead>	can I update an httponly cookie via an AJAX call?  I know JS shouldn't be able to access these cookies (intentionally), but perhaps it could be updated during the request or response without getting JS involved?
<mmmveggies>	I think you can do it if you hack into the browser's secret clojure compiler
<Synthead>	I'm using AJAX to authenticate a user, and the server creates an httponly cookie.  I want to update this after successful login.  As of now, it works if I refresh the page after login (without ajax)
<bewl>	why not update it upon authenticating serverside?
<Synthead>	mmmveggies: surely I'm not the only one trying to do this
<Perseus0>	is it good practice to install node modules globally?
<Synthead>	bewl: I'm not sure how to update it
<hipsterslapfight>	Perseus0: no
<Perseus0>	thanks
<hipsterslapfight>	not unless it's absolutely necessary (eg, for cli modules)
<mmmveggies>	if you're using them as executables, yes
<ezakimak>	Synthead, why does the cookie matter if it's an SPA?
<Synthead>	ezakimak: spa?
<ezakimak>	single page app
<bewl>	that is true
<ezakimak>	when you send an ajax, you can send any cookie you want, the *server* doesn't care what flags are set on it
<Synthead>	ezakimak: as one example, logging out.  if I try to log out without that cookie, my app throws an exeption.  I could monkey patch it, but that's gross
<ezakimak>	so send the cookie
<Perseus0>	hipsterslapfight: im trying to get gulp to work, which was before I installed it globally
<ezakimak>	"the cookie" being a string of data added to the headers of your ajax request
<Synthead>	ezakimak: I'm using httponly cookies, so JS cannot read it
<Perseus0>	and the C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\gulp\bin doesn't work anymore in Win
<bewl>	I think you are trying to solve this problem on the wrong slice of the stack
<ezakimak>	not necessarily the value of the cookie stored in the browser's unaccessible-to-javascript memory
<Synthead>	ezakimak: however, if the browser can update the cookie via a header or something during the authentication ajax or something, I'd be set
<Synthead>	ezakimak: what else?
<ezakimak>	but it can't, so that means you need another way
<ezakimak>	simple solution: remove the httponly flag
<Synthead>	ezakimak: security
<ezakimak>	are you running 3rd party scripts?
<bewl>	by accessing it via javascript, you are throwing security out of the window anyways
<Synthead>	bewl: accessing what?
<Synthead>	ezakimak: slickgrid, jquery, jquery ui, etc
<ezakimak>	those are libraries.
<Synthead>	ezakimak: however, if I can do it without making security compromises, that's better
<ezakimak>	and you can host them yourself
<Synthead>	ezakimak: yeah that's what I'm doing now
<ezakimak>	which vectors are you specifically trying to manage?
<Synthead>	ezakimak: however, httponly cookies exist to secure things like session ids.  throwing that out the window because it's "hard" is a great way to start writing a vulnerable app
<ezakimak>	again, what vulnerabilities are you specifically worried about?
<Synthead>	ezakimak: anything; it's the principle of the matter
<Side_FX>	Is there something wrong with this syntax?:" 	if (document.getElementById("checker2").value == '1' && document.getElementById("username").value != null) {
<ezakimak>	no, you can't just say "anything" in a security context.
<bewl>	I am still confused as to why this isnt all being done on whatever server sided langugage you are using
<Synthead>	ezakimak: I could write a chrome/chromium extension to steal sessions, as one example
<Synthead>	ezakimak: it's wide open
<ezakimak>	you can only secure what you can control. period, which is usually in a web app context the server itself
<jaawerth>	alright so I think I've got the js-csp folks on board with changing csp.CLOSED to a value other than null (so you can use "null" as a legit value in a channel and not accidentally close it by passing in a "null" result from a function). The question then becomes what to sue in its place. You can easily use, say, an empty object since comparison would be reference equality. But would it make sense to check for Symbol availability, and us a Symbol instead
<jaawerth>	 when possible?
<jaawerth>	use a Symbol*
<Synthead>	ezakimak: httponly cookies takes the control out of JS intentionally for reasons like this.  I don't want to explicitly implement poor practices for dumb reasons
<mmmveggies>	is there uh a link to a ticket
<andrc>	I have a question. What do companies like Sencha use to secure their javascript frameworks?!
<ezakimak>	well, basic signal theory often has to deal with distinguishing data from signalling tokens
<bewl>	Then dont use JS to solve this problem
<jaawerth>	mmmveggies: me?
<ezakimak>	mistaking data for delimiters is a problem, thus you have for example ansi escape sequences
<Synthead>	ezakimak, bewl: I'll get back to google, thanks guys
<andrc>	They have a javascript library which the license for is 3k. And I cant seem to understand how since javascript is pretty much an open book?
<ezakimak>	if a channel is for *data*, there should be an out-of-band way to send control signals, or a standard way to delimit them from data
<bewl>	Synthead: You should be updating the cookie from the server
<jaawerth>	ezakimak: yeah, it irritated me to see it was null, because to me the whole ponit of having a csp.CLOSED is so you don't have to use a built-in value. That's something that always drives me crazy about node streams too. 'What if I want to write "null" to a stream?'
<bewl>	thats pretty much how it should be done
<bewl>	if security is a problem.
<jaawerth>	ezakimak: highland takes care of this by having _.nil (which is simply an empty object)
<ezakimak>	do they not have any sort of message envelope?
<Synthead>	bewl: the server creates a cookie, but it's only seen in the http response of the ajax call when the user logs in.  it doesn't get "set" to the current page.
<jaawerth>	I don't believe so, no
<ezakimak>	but an empty object should be valid data also
<ezakimak>	well, that complicates things greatly.
<jaawerth>	well, var a = {}, b = {}; a ===b is going to be false
<jaawerth>	so if you set csp.CLOSED = {}, then it will only stop the channel if you use THAT empty object
<ezakimak>	is the stream designed to allow serialization also?
<ezakimak>	that could work
<ezakimak>	would be nice if it were a constant
<jaawerth>	channels don't have a ton of built-in stuff, you can pass pretty much any value you want through it. heck, it's left up to the user to actually check for csp.CLOSED anyway
<kevireilly>	Synthead: the server is sending a Set-Cookie header? and this isn’t a CORS request correct
<bewl>	You should be storing alot of this information in a session state object
<jaawerth>	(but not everywhere, I don't think)
<Perseus0>	can i install a node module directly to here C:\Program Files\nodejs\node_modules
<Perseus0>	?
<ezakimak>	i'm sure there's a way
<Synthead>	kevireilly: let me double check.  and no, not at cors request
<ezakimak>	i've seen them installed in lots of places
<kevireilly>	Perseus0: I’m not super familiar with node in windows, but doing an `npm install xyz` in C:\Program Files\nodejs might do it?
<Perseus0>	what is xyz ?
<jaawerth>	ezakimak: this is the lib if you're curious https://github.com/ubolonton/js-csp - overall it's pretty great, but not quite ready for primte time. They need to fix this, and also put in better error passing
<kevireilly>	Perseus0: what you want to install
<Perseus0>	gulp
<Perseus0>	was working
<Perseus0>	before i installed it globally
<Perseus0>	now the path won't work and the gulp cmd isn't recognized
<jaawerth>	I submitted this as an issue before doing a PR just to make sure they weren't holding off for a reason https://github.com/ubolonton/js-csp/issues/60 but now that it's confirmed I figured I'd do a PR
<jaawerth>	just a little undecided whether it makes sense to test for ES6 Symbol availability and use a Symbol when applicable instead of an empty object
<jaawerth>	it SEEMS to match the use-case for a Symbol
<Synthead>	kevireilly: yeah, it's sending Set-Cookie
<kevireilly>	Perseus0: what does `npm list -g` tell you?
<kevireilly>	Synthead: ah excellent. So when you make for instance another AJAX request and inspect the headers of that request, no cookie is being sent?
<Perseus0>	I get a long tree of files kevireilly
<kevireilly>	Perseus0: sorry, I meant the first line which should point to the path where global packages are installed
<kevireilly>	but while you’re looking at that list, gulp is in there?
<Perseus0>	can't see the first line with git bash lol
<kevireilly>	I’m not familiar with git bash, but in linux you’d do something like `npm list -g | more`
<kevireilly>	to get pages
<kevireilly>	ah and —depth=0 will only give you the first root which should reduce the output
<Synthead>	kevireilly: there is a cookie, and it's being sent, but it contains data that doesn't validate the user, of course.  the ajax header response contains a Set-Cookie value, and this one has the correct data to validate the user
<kevireilly>	Perseus0: this also might be a conversation better suited for #node.js
<Synthead>	kevireilly: I'm looking to "apply" the Set-Cookie value in the ajax response to the current document, if possible
<kevireilly>	Synthead: hmm it should apply it to future requests, not the current one
<Perseus0>	but yeah, gulp isn't there kevireilly
<kevireilly>	Perseus0: yet `npm install -g gulp` acts like it worked?
<kevireilly>	you can do it again without breaking anything
<Perseus0>	the npm list -g is retrieving this C:\Program Files\nodejs\node_modules\npm\node_modules
<Perseus0>	yeah
<Perseus0>	i will
<Synthead>	kevireilly: oh really?  if an ajax response contains Set-Cookie, it should apply it to the current document?  I'm using jQuery's $.ajax; is there something special I have to do with it?
<kevireilly>	interesting, I think the default path on windows is C:\Users\paul.redman\AppData\Roaming\npm
<Perseus0>	thanks
<kevireilly>	if your name was paul.redman
<Perseus0>	:D
<Perseus0>	let me try that path as well btw
<kevireilly>	Synthead: I thought so at least and you should be able to inspect cookies of your browser
<Perseus0>	:)
<Perseus0>	it's that path indeed
<Perseus0>	thanks kevireilly
<kevireilly>	no problem
<Synthead>	kevireilly: yeah I can inspect them via the dev console in chromium.  let me see if this cookie is being set.  I also found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3340797/can-an-ajax-response-set-a-cookie  (looks like you're right on point)
<kevireilly>	Synthead: in chrome as an example, right mouse click the page and select View Page info and then Show cookies and site data
<kevireilly>	ah gotcha
<Perseus0>	kevireilly: one last question, if i run gulp on a project that actually has a gulpfile.js and I get [19:09:32] Local gulp not found in c:\ [19:09:32] Try running: npm install gulp
<Perseus0>	means it's not installed globally, right?
<Torqable>	add -g
<Torqable>	to install global
<Perseus0>	already installed it globally though
<Torqable>	huh
<Torqable>	have you upgraded node recently
<Perseus0>	yes
<Torqable>	sometimes messes with my global libs
<Perseus0>	yes i did
<kevireilly>	supposedly you need to do both
<kevireilly>	npm install gulp --save-dev
<Perseus0>	^thanks, let me try
<Perseus0>	ok it did something
<ezakimak>	Synthead, googling "ajax httponly cookie" yielded several discussions on the topic
<Perseus0>	but still not working in the project
<ezakimak>	most say that the cookie portion should "just work" as long as it's to the same domain
<Synthead>	ezakimak: yeah I didn't know that ajax responses automatically set cookies.  I'll get digging on what this issue is, then
<Torqable>	try reinstalling it global
<Torqable>	uninstall -g
<Torqable>	npm cache clean
<ezakimak>	however, they also mention that not all browsers support/honor it--thus you're depending on client-controlled user agent functionality
<Torqable>	install -g
<Synthead>	kevireilly: I'll do a bit of digging and see what this problem is.  thank you very much for the help!
<Perseus0>	npm uninstall -g gulp? Torqable
<Torqable>	yar try that
<Perseus0>	ok thanks
<Perseus0>	a sec
<ezakimak>	honestly--it doesn't really add any real security
<Perseus0>	Torqable: normal dirs when installing globally? http://laravel.io/bin/KkXrz
<Torqable>	not sure what you mean
<Perseus0>	I mean, is it supposed to install there
<Perseus0>	as in globally
<Perseus0>	because it's installing in git
<Torqable>	oh I have not idea what npm does on windows
<Perseus0>	im using git bash
<Perseus0>	and it's installing in git
<Perseus0>	so that's the problem
<Torqable>	does sound strange
<Perseus0>	it does
<Perseus0>	im gonna use the normal cmd
<Torqable>	oh, running npm commands from git bash?
<Perseus0>	yes
<Torqable>	hrm yea try regular cmd line
<Perseus0>	ty
<Torqable>	or install cygwin or something
<Torqable>	would highly recommend using cygwin over git bash if you're actually spending time in the cmd line for development
<ezakimak>	windows is unusable w/o cygwin for me
<Side_FX>	You ever spend 45 minutes debugging something just to realized it's working correctly and you're just retarded?
<Torqable>	lol
<ezakimak>	i'm sure that's bitten everyone at one time
<jstag>	hello guys
<jstag>	i want to edit the print page
<Perseus0>	Torqable: still not globally
<Torqable>	is it installing in a different place?
*	juampy_ is now known as juampy
<jstag>	remove the number, how i could do it with js or css ?
<Perseus0>	it's installing in C:\Users\NAME\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\gulp\bin
<Torqable>	wat
<kevireilly>	Perseus0: why not use the node console that comes with node?
<kevireilly>	you can do git there also
<ezakimak>	jstag, google  "css media print query"
<ezakimak>	it's not a js issue.
<jstag>	ezakimak ok think, have you got a link please ?
<ezakimak>	http://google.com
<jstag>	thanks :)
<Torqable>	（〜^∇^)〜
<Perseus0>	Torqable: i get a npm should be run outside of the node repl, in your normal shell.
<Perseus0>	(Press Control-D to exit.)
*	knod_away is now known as knod
<Perseus0>	oh lol
<kevireilly>	hrm I’ve had pretty good luck with “Node.js command prompt” that ships with the windows node binary
<kevireilly>	perhaps part of what it solves is path stuff, me not sure
<Perseus0>	node.exe Torqable ?
<Torqable>	huh?
<kevireilly>	for me, Start > Node.js > Node.js command prompt
<Torqable>	oh
<ezakimak>	remember, it's windows. click click click.
<Torqable>	idk, havn't used windows in like forever
<Perseus0>	yeah
<Perseus0>	same
<Perseus0>	noje.js = node.exe
<AimerPaddle>	or even using cmder : http://gooseberrycreative.com/cmder/
<serses>	nodejs under windows sucks. at least for me
<jstag>	ezakimak is it possible to save the print page with js ?
<kevireilly>	I got forced to use windows at work, was super stoked after it having been years
<jstag>	for example a visitor want to print a page
<Torqable>	stoked about using windows?
<Perseus0>	if i do npm install -g gulp in node.js I get a do it somewhere else type of message
<jstag>	I want to see which page he has printed
<kevireilly>	forgot to wrap my statement in <sarcasm> tags
<Torqable>	last time I used it I almost threw the computer against a wall
<Perseus0>	:(
<Perseus0>	can't I just install gulp on the damn project folder?
<Perseus0>	and run it there
<Perseus0>	to compile sass
<kevireilly>	Perseus0: did you try the command prompt that ships with node yet?
<Perseus0>	yes
<kevireilly>	can you pastie.org the whole error?
<Perseus0>	npm should be run outside of the node repl, in your normal shell.
<Perseus0>	(Press Control-D to exit.)
<ezakimak>	jstag, well, a google search for "javascript print event" results in the first hint having some solutions.
<ezakimak>	*hit
<kevireilly>	because `npm install -g gulp` works for me from it
<Perseus0>	-.-
<kevireilly>	Perseus0: er wait, you’re in the repl as in you did `node` first?
<tarkus>	Q: In SPA app, how do you recommend to embed initial(bootstrap) data into your index.html page (1) inline script, (2) data attribute, (3) external .js script.. ?
<Perseus0>	what do you mean?
<kevireilly>	Perseus0: do you see a > on the screen or a C:\path
<Perseus0>	no
<Perseus0>	just Node.js
<Perseus0>	oh
<ezakimak>	tarkus, using separate js files is fairly common
<Perseus0>	I see a > on the screen yes kevireilly
<kevireilly>	huh? the error message says you’re in the repl, so you can do javascript, but you can’t do command line commands
<Perseus0>	^
<ezakimak>	but it may depend on from where the data is being sourced
<ezakimak>	using html data- attributes may be a viable solution in some cases
<kevireilly>	Perseus0: Not the “Node.js” program, the “Node.js command prompt” program
<jstag>	ezakimak i just found onbeforeprint onafterprint, there are nothing that could let me save the printf view of the visitor
<ezakimak>	did you check that link?
<Perseus0>	oh yes! kevireilly thanks
<Perseus0>	that's that
<ezakimak>	it talks about which browsers support that, and how to do it in other browsers that don't
<kevireilly>	no problem
<Perseus0>	same behavior though as in the normal cmd line or git bash kevireilly
<kevireilly>	Perseus0: perhaps I missed what that behavior is, it successfully installs but what happens?
<Perseus0>	http://laravel.io/bin/RE6Q8
<Perseus0>	it does install every time as in admin of course but
<kevireilly>	Perseus0: and the output from node.js command prompt?
<Perseus0>	send you a bin of where it's installed, thank you
<Perseus0>	that's that
<Perseus0>	do you want the full output?
<Perseus0>	ok
<kevireilly>	not sure how the node.js command prompt would be installing to a git path
<kevireilly>	but perhaps git bash boofed something for yah
<Perseus0>	yes
<Perseus0>	that's what i have checked before
<Perseus0>	if i install them here C:\Program Files\nodejs\node_modules ?
<kevireilly>	Perseus0: what does `npm config get prefix` say? we should probably still take this to #node.js btw ;)
<Perseus0>	yes we should :D
<Perseus0>	kevireilly: git/local :( let's continue in the node channel, thanks a lot so far

<loorinm>	my question is: I am applying to a programming school and I need to make a project which shows my knowledge of higher order functions. I understand the concepts but I don't know what kind of project to make. I have only made one project with javascript
<tipdbmp>	loorinm, you could try to find inspiration from this book: http://hop.perl.plover.com/book/pdf/HigherOrderPerl.pdf although it's about uses perl and not javascript.
<ezakimak>	loorinm, or look at the articles about ramda
<loorinm>	ok thanks @tipdbmp I will check that out

<Sorella>	tarkus: right, have you tried doing all of that on the server?
<Sorella>	I.e.: rendering the page on the server and sending it to the client? If so, why did it not work?
<linman32>	Hannibal_Smith: thanks. will look into this
<Hannibal_Smith>	In theory linman32 you can do a busy loop and checking Performance.now(), but I think that any js vm will alert the user
<Hannibal_Smith>	js has no way to access to some assembly instruction like nop for doing something like this
<tarkus>	Sorella, yep I'm rendering on the server, React app picks it up, but in order to render client-side it first needs to get the data to work with
<Hannibal_Smith>	So probably you have to use a mix of requestAnimationframe and Performance.now
<xsi>	What would one programmer do if his of her wife/husband said that he/she hates his/her programming and programs?
<vileRaisin>	also wise to note that implementation of performance.now() differs on browsers
<Sorella>	tarkus: why do you need to re-render it on the client right away?
<Hannibal_Smith>	Yes, really good point vileRaisin
<Hannibal_Smith>	I read that some browser were considering offering a less precise version of Performance.now because security concens
<Hannibal_Smith>	*concerns
*	lanceball is now known as lance|afk
<gtristan>	Anyone have an idea where I could get my hands on an installer for chrome 31 for windows ?
<gtristan>	its fairly recent, and I cant seem to reproduce this reported bug without it :-S
*	knod is now known as knod_away
<linman32>	Hannibal_Smith: trying to not tie up cpu 100% with polling method though. cpu heavy pages are kind of annoying.
<tarkus>	Sorella, how do you do otherwise. if you don't call React.render(<App />, ..) the app will just won't work, the page will be static without any functionality.. and before you can call React.render you need to load the initial data to work with
<Hannibal_Smith>	linman32, yes try how much you can get only using requestAnimationFrame
<kevireilly>	ezakimak: you’ve worked with ko a fair amount yah?
<STRML>	gtristan: http://www.filehippo.com/download_google_chrome/history/23
<ezakimak>	yes
<Hannibal_Smith>	Unfortunatelly a C/C++ dev can use some tricks with the help of the OS
<Hannibal_Smith>	A js that has to run a browser can't
<linman32>	Hannibal_Smith: cool, thanks for tip
<gatti>	howdy yall, i created a script that appends two types of rows, alternating, at the end of a table. Some of the cells are text box inputs. How do I properly acquire the inputs in the text boxes for this newly created table?
<linman32>	Hannibal_Smith: yeah, it is understandable. the limitations w/ a browser
<kevireilly>	ezakimak: from a templating / reflow perspective, how do you manage the insertion of a ko template? innerHTML?
<tarkus>	Sorella, so i'm thinking how to load that initial data for dehydration..
<gtristan>	STRML, those dont link to their respective versions anymore
<gtristan>	they all go to 'download latest'
<STRML>	Ah. Well.. keep googling
<STRML>	sorry.
<ezakimak>	kevireilly, i don't understand your question
<ezakimak>	what is "a ko template"?
<ezakimak>	maybe ask in #knockoutjs
*	gtristan wonders if a chromium from the same epoch would do
<kevireilly>	ezakimak: sorry, not sure to what extent it might be a ko convetion or not, but dynamic insertion of template partials to be parsed and ran
<ezakimak>	that's not usually how you use ko, although it can be made to do it if you really want to
<ezakimak>	have you done the ko tutorials yet?
<kevireilly>	but actually I found out that it wasn’t necessarily a fork and more heavy inspiration
<ezakimak>	just using ko.applyBindings() once is usually sufficient--everything else can be managed seemlessly for you by ko
<kevireilly>	not a bad idea indeed
<ezakimak>	the templates are *html*
<vileRaisin>	seems like jellynote has it's own setTimeout function for <100ms, other than that they just check the current date to set the next timeout
<ezakimak>	so you get the fast parsing of the browser's native parser
<vileRaisin>	kinda hard to read their minified code though, especially if searching takes ages on my laptop :)
<ezakimak>	and ko's dependency tracking makes it so that a minimal amount of dom manipulation occurs when things change
<kevireilly>	ezakimak: hrm yeah seems applyBindings isn’t a defined method in this incarnation. Seems that these partials are added via innertHTML and the dom node’s children do the same thing recursively
<giuseppesolinas>	hello
<ezakimak>	i don't know what lib you're talking about
<aceus>	Hey, i'm having a question regarding iphone screen resolutions. I have created an image in PS which I want to use as a background image for my iPhone web application. Is it possible with javascript to display different images depending on which iphone device the page is running on?
<jeremyabel>	hey js friends
<Torqable>	ermergerd I have a friend
<jeremyabel>	reading through some lodash code, encountered this: https://github.com/lodash/lodash/blob/master/lodash.js#L1869
<ezakimak>	aceus, ask in #css about media queries
<STRML>	jeremyabel: Hey, labels!
<STRML>	You don't see those much anymore.
<aceus>	thanks
<jeremyabel>	STRML: or ever, in my case!
<jeremyabel>	what's it doing?
<STRML>	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/label
<giuseppesolinas>	I have this json object: json = {  foo : 'bar' , { baz : 1  } } how do I access the "baz" property??
<kevireilly>	ezakimak: sorry, wish I could be more specific. I’ll chjeck out ko and how they manage dependencies in regards to DOM manipulation because what I think I’m seeing is not miniziming manipulation
<Torqable>	wow yea a label
<STRML>	giuseppesolinas: That's not valid json
<vileRaisin>	haha I've always wanted to use labels
<jeremyabel>	oh dang
<Torqable>	is that a speed thing?
<jeremyabel>	look at that big ol'red AVOID USING LABELS box
<ezakimak>	giuseppesolinas, there is no such thing as a json object
<Torqable>	yea lol
<STRML>	Technically it could be faster than a function
<ezakimak>	json is a string.
<giuseppesolinas>	STRML : I had one like this and it's read with no problem
<ezakimak>	and that isn't valid js, and if it's a string it's not valid json either
<Torqable>	jeremyabel: its just a goto
<jeremyabel>	Torqable: ugh
<Torqable>	yea lol
*	jeremyabel dies a little inside
<Sorella>	tarkus: either do an additional HTTP request, or put the data as a JSON in the HTML.
<jeremyabel>	just gonna... yoink the function I need out of lodash and... not do the goto thing...
<giuseppesolinas>	STRML: it's allegedly a json object and it's successfully read
<jeremyabel>	they need to make a bundler thingy that is intelligent down to the function level rather than the file level I think :P
<ezakimak>	read by *what*?
<jeremyabel>	like if I require() lodash it drags ALL OF IT in there even if I only use 5 functions :P
<ezakimak>	you mean like python's "from <module> import foo,bar,baz" ?
<GreenJello>	jeremyabel, require('lodash/object/merge') or whatever
<Torqable>	jeremyabel: lodash is modular
<jeremyabel>	oh, rad
<Torqable>	yar
<Sorella>	>> function add(a, b){ var r = b; labels_are_amazing: while(true){ if (a === 0) break labels_are_amazing; else { ++b; --a; r = b; continue labels_are_amazing } }; return r }; add(1e5, 1e5)
<ecmabot>	Sorella: (number) 200000
<Torqable>	labels_are_amazing
<Torqable>	lol
<jeremyabel>	is that like saying "goto is amazing?"
<Sorella>	jeremyabel: it is :)
<ezakimak>	i just heard "amaaaaaaazing" in my mind as yelled by sheryl (archer)
<Sorella>	I'd love having goto in JS. Though TCO would solve most of my problems
<jeremyabel>	ahahah me too
<tarkus>	STRML, can you give an example what kind of "timing issue" you can experience if load initial data by using external .js script? I don't quite get it
<jeremyabel>	ok random question, how do y'all view assignments stuffed inside conditonals? Reading through d3 source code and he's all about stuff like var c; if ( c = someArray.length ) { ... }
<ljharb>	awful.
<ljharb>	don't conflate assignment with an expression value
<jeremyabel>	agreed
<jeremyabel>	lemme find this other line that just had me totally scratching my head
<Torqable>	this is the same guy doing goofy (b += a = +a) || b /1 shit
<Sorella>	jeremyabel: That idiomatic C awfulness is awful. But then, most mutating is
<Torqable>	what is the point of that
<jeremyabel>	Trieste: yeah pretty much
<ljharb>	trying to be clever.
<jeremyabel>	he's alllll over that shit
<ljharb>	cleverness is an antipattern.
<Torqable>	agreed
<ezakimak>	i think it just shows disdain
<Sorella>	Isn't d3's source code pretty much all about awfulness?
<Torqable>	seems so
<jeremyabel>	Sorella: yeah
<jeremyabel>	it's like, really hard to read, all over the place
<Sorella>	Yeah, I wouldn't recommend reading it then :)
<ezakimak>	unless you *need* a headache
<jeremyabel>	hence why I'm grabbing out the bits I want and making them not awful
<Torqable>	Sorella: please expand on labels and why they are amazing
<jeremyabel>	I only ever use very specific bits of it
<GreenJello>	I wonder how many times 'todo' appears in the source these days
<Torqable>	I have literally never used one
<GreenJello>	oh no, that was three.js
<Sorella>	Torqable: they allow a limited form of goto in JS. And I need that to do TCO when compiling my language to JS.
<GreenJello>	I still need to really learn d3
<Torqable>	unless you count jumps in assembly
<Sorella>	(Well, having actual goto would be better, ofc)
<ezakimak>	Torqable, you have if you've ever used switch with 'default'
<vileRaisin>	as Sorella demonstrated, why use a conditional when you can use labels
<ezakimak>	that is essentially a label
<GreenJello>	Torqable, you don't need labels
*	lance|afk is now known as lanceball
<GreenJello>	Sorella is using them for some weird stuff
<Torqable>	well, yea
<Sorella>	Yeah. Unless you're compiling some language to JS, in which case you need both them and unreadable switch statements
<Torqable>	but I'm still interested
<Sorella>	I-I-It's not weird! D:
<zlude>	Hey, how can I put a layer in a place of google maps, like that "https://www.uber.com/pt/cities/toronto" it's a layer in toronto, how can I do that? what I need to search to learn about?
<vileRaisin>	it's even cooler to have assignments in switch statements with no breaks
<GreenJello>	Sorella, it's not something most people do :-)
<Sorella>	Torqable: basically, I'm using them to transform `function add(a, b){ return a === 0? b : add(a - 1, b + 1) }` into something that uses constant stack.
<GreenJello>	i.e. weird
<vileRaisin>	with labels
<GreenJello>	that's as cool as a car with no brakes
<jeremyabel>	lol
<GreenJello>	(very, until it crashes)
<Sorella>	And I'd like to use monotonically increasing numeric constants in a switch for pattern matching where the compiler can determine the types that flow through the method.
<ezakimak>	duff's device is pretty cool
<Sorella>	So it's compiled to a jumptable, instead of doing several comparisons.
<Sorella>	But of course, you don't do that if you're writing actual JS :P
<jeremyabel>	oh man found it
<jeremyabel>	x2_ = y2_ = -(x1_ = y1_ = Infinity);
<Stalkr_>	Anyone using Backbone, do you prefer collection.fetch().done(//) or collection.fetch(success://)? What kind of callback would you use
<jeremyabel>	that is the most bullshit line I've ever seen in my life
<Torqable>	Sorella: cool stuff
<jeremyabel>	if anyone can find a more bullshit line than that, let me know
<ezakimak>	how much typing is that saving, really?
<Sorella>	It's much simpler to do in a typed language (like PureScript).
<jeremyabel>	way less for me cause I have to like, sit down and type out wtf is actually happening
<jeremyabel>	since I can't look at a line like that and actually mentally parse it
<ezakimak>	that line is actually pretty clear to me
<Sorella>	Purr is untyped and I can't statically infer anything without whole program analysis, so optimisation is hard :'(
<jeremyabel>	smarter than me then!
<ezakimak>	but in very poor taste
<Torqable>	why are you doing a code review on D3
<Torqable>	anyway
<jeremyabel>	I needed to do some modifications
<jeremyabel>	and I encountered a bunch of weirdness and was like, why would anyone do this
<Torqable>	you could make a feature request
<vileRaisin>	d4.js
<jeremyabel>	I will eventually, but I needed it done asap so I just did it
<tarkus>	Sorella, as far as I understand you recommend to load initial data with an additional HTTP request (as opposed to embeding it into HTML page)?
<Sorella>	tarkus: depends on your application.
<linman32>	vileRaisin: where did u find setTimeout?
<STRML>	If your data doesn't change rapidly it is okay to do it via another request
<episage>	im confused on how ES5 map work. it seems async coz it does not return values immidiately
<tarkus>	Sorella, it's a medium.com like site, with SSR and React
<Sorella>	I'd do it for something like e.g.: Twitter
<jeremyabel>	ok thanks for identifying the label, back to work I go
<episage>	var snippetPromises = elements.map((element, index) => {
<vileRaisin>	the code is minified linman32, but you can search it
<vileRaisin>	but it's nothing interesting
<episage>	and that returns array with 0 length
<episage>	altough it has return webdriver.promise.all([ .. at the end of map callback
<vileRaisin>	they compare date.now() (which AFAIK has the best millisecond precision) with last date.now() call and base the next setTimeout on that
<vileRaisin>	but there was a line where they checked if the timer is <100ms and would call something else instead
<episage>	example: http://pastebin.com/B6naHrcx returns emty array instead of promises
<vileRaisin>	for all I know they could be using webgl and web workers to get accurate timing
<vileRaisin>	I don't know, something super fancy only Sorella could come up with
<Torqable>	episage: map is not async
<episage>	why do i get an empty array in http://pastebin.com/B6naHrcx
<episage>	its straightforward code
<episage>	snippetPromises.length==0
<episage>	and map is called after return is called!
<episage>	im using node.js
<episage>	Torqable:
<Torqable>	then your function is incorrect
<Torqable>	map just executes a function for each elem of a collection
<Sorella>	episage: probably because elements.length == 0
<Sorella>	(Assuming "elements" is an Array)
<Sorella>	If it isn't an Array, `.map` could be doing anything.
<episage>	Torqable: LOL
<Torqable>	?
<episage>	Torqable: YOU ARE RIGHT MAN
<episage>	Torqable: thanks
<episage>	:P
<Torqable>	:\
<Sorella>	That code is really complicated though =/
<Torqable>	yea its a bit of a mess and would benefit from being moved into its function
<episage>	how would you refactor this?
<episage>	like move each assignment into separate fn?
<javascript448>	hi guys
<Sorella>	episage: I'd just not use JS for it :)
<Torqable>	...
<episage>	Sorella: what are the options?
<Torqable>	no
<javascript448>	how can i add a line break before the 2nd comma from the back on an address line:      123 Main St, Unit 200, Los Angeles, CA 90023
<javascript448>	to break to 2nd line before Los Angeles?
<javascript448>	can you help :)
<ezakimak>	huh?
<Sorella>	Well, you're using WebDriver. Python, Ruby, etc. are all options. But so are languages that compile to JS and have better support to asynchronous programming (like Dart)
<dandaman>	hi all, I'm not quite sure if this is a JS question or a rails question, but either way, I make an ajax call to get a json array. If i look in the network portion of the developer tools the JSON response is fine, but when I print it out to console the sections hashmap breaks, check out https://gist.github.com/dsauerbrun/8ea26e5987826b39dc61 in the console.log file you'll see in output['sections']['1']['data'] uses numerical keys instead of the 
<Sorella>	I don't usually like Ruby, but for dealing with WebDriver, it offers the best API from the official ones
<dandaman>	I need those keys and have no idea why i am losing them
<vileRaisin>	javascript448: im curious, is it always the 2nd from the end
<javascript448>	yes dandaman
<theviajerock>	Good Afternoon..
<javascript448>	from back there will only be 2 commas always.
<javascript448>	but from  front maybe multiple
<theviajerock>	I have a little problem or confusion with something...
<episage>	Sorella: that's interesting. i always though that TS is the best choice when it comes to JS
<vileRaisin>	and it's a string?
<dandaman>	javascript448: eh?
<javascript448>	so we just need to replace the 2nd comma from the back with a linebreak or a <br>
<vileRaisin>	if the whole thing is a string
<deltab>	>> '123 Main St, Unit 200, Los Angeles, CA 90023'.replace(/, ([^,]*,[^,]*)$/, ',\n$1')
<ecmabot>	deltab: (string) '123 Main St, Unit 200,\nLos Angeles, CA 90023'
<javascript448>	sorry meant to say vileraisin :) not dandman :)
<vileRaisin>	yeah or that
<javascript448>	deltab, will that replace the comma from the back?  the 2nd one always?
<episage>	Sorella: you mean await and async in Dart?
<vileRaisin>	personally i'd just do split(',')
<vileRaisin>	and then do length - 2
<Sorella>	episage: TS just adds a gradual type system to JS, which is also fairly limited and unsound, so it's not something I'd use for having a type system. Flow does a better job, but it's incomplete for now. Infernu is pretty impressive, but also a WIP. PureScript is the best fleshed-out option around, but it's a whole new language/paradigm.
<vileRaisin>	but a regex is cool
<shoky>	dandaman: your text got cut off after "numerical keys instead of the a"
<deltab>	javascript448: yes (if it has a space after it)
<ezakimak>	dandaman, what is your actual problem?
<Sorella>	episage: yup. But also futures and streams.
<dandaman>	in the console.log file you'll see in output['sections']['1']['data'] uses numerical keys instead of the actual key values which are shown in the response
<Sorella>	There's also ClojureScript, which is pretty neat, but a Lisp.
<dandaman>	ezakimak: so are you looking at the gist?
<dandaman>	ezakimak: compare the 'sections' maps
<episage>	Sorella: lol! purescript looks like prolog-ruby-functional sth
<Sorella>	And only supports optional typing through Typed Clojure (though TC supports higher-kinds, refinements and several neat things that you don't see in other type systems)
<Torqable>	episage: its haskell lol
<javascript448>	how can i change this to replace(/, ([^,]*,[^,]*)$/, ',\n$1')     use  <br> instead of  \n
<dandaman>	the 'data' maps don't have their keys in the console.log version
<javascript448>	replace(/, ([^,]*,[^,]*)$/, ',<br>$1')
<deltab>	javascript448: the $ anchors it at the end, and each [^,]* matches a string without commas
<javascript448>	is correct?
<Sorella>	episage: it's basically Haskell + row polymorphic extensible records with scoped labels :P
<deltab>	javascript448: yes
<javascript448>	tnx buddy :)
<ezakimak>	dandaman, i don't see any problem
<episage>	Crazy!
<shoky>	dandaman: dandaman you have a syntax problem
<episage>	I'm going for it
<shoky>	dandaman: see line 272 in the response
<episage>	Cheers Sorella and Torqable
<shoky>	dandaman: whoops sorry , eyes deceived me. ignore
<dandaman>	ezakimak: line 83 in each file
<ezakimak>	they are different, yes.
<jaawerth>	since you're already using ES6, I'd probably just use an iterator
<jaawerth>	er, a generator/iterator
<jaawerth>	episage^
<dandaman>	ezakimak: the one with actual keys is what I am seeing in my response, then when i console.log the response i get the one with the integers as keys
<dandaman>	I don't know why I'm losing my keys
<ezakimak>	you usually find them in the last place you look! :)
<shoky>	what exactly are you logging
<jaawerth>	episage: or even without a generator, if you used transducers you could easily get it into iterator form and then use the .map from transducers
<jaawerth>	solves this exact kind of problem, mapping arbitrary stuff
<ezakimak>	what exactly are you doing with the data between the response and console.log() ?
<dandaman>	shoky and ezakimak: I'm not touching the data at all
<javascript448>	deltab, how can I get just the first part before the 2nd comma from back?
<javascript448>	like basicaly line 1
<episage>	jaawerth: im reading about the transducers atm
<javascript448>	and then a seprate call for line 2 to strip out line 2
<shoky>	dandaman: someone is
<dandaman>	https://gist.github.com/dsauerbrun/8ea26e5987826b39dc61
<dandaman>	i added my code
<dandaman>	i am not touching the data
<ezakimak>	what does $http do to it?
<dandaman>	you'll notice if you compare line 83 the structure is slightly different as well
<ezakimak>	it should be a *string* if it did nothing
<javascript448>	deltab can you help? :) please. how can I get only line 1 of that string instead of doing br for line2, just return lin1 part
<dandaman>	ezakimak: $http is the http requestor for angular
<dandaman>	not quite sure that it touches the response data
<ezakimak>	great, so what does angular use to parse json? cause you should be getting a string, instead you're getting an incorrectly parsed json result
<Sorella>	episage: you'd write this in Mermaid: https://gist.github.com/robotlolita/44087307ffc46cd8763a#file-webdriver-maid-rb
<dandaman>	ezakimak: ok, ill start there
<jaawerth>	dandaman: any http interceptors set up?
<episage>	Sorella: wow
*	Sorella is still finishing the standard library and compiler for said language though
<ravenzz>	sup
<episage>	Sorella: that looks really clear
<episage>	although im not that familiar with functional programming
<Sorella>	episage: it's one of the goals :) It's a very simple language for teaching. And the semantics are pretty close to JS
<Sorella>	Oh, it's OO, not functional
<javascript448>	how can i get the first part of the address  123 Main St, Unit 200, Los Angeles, CA 29340    (to cut before the 2nd comma from the back) and return  the first half
<dandaman>	jaawerth: not to my knowledge
<jaawerth>	IIRC angular's parser is angular.fromJSON, which just wraps JSON.parse. But it will also pass the returend data through any response interceptors you've set up, or any default transformResponse functions configured on $http
<jaawerth>	but if you've done nothing and nobody's set those things on $http then it probably isn't that
<episage>	Sorella: can you pass me a link to the Mermaid language? is that Ruby?
<NBhosting>	games created in javasscript can be converted to iphone and andriod apps?
<Sorella>	episage: https://github.com/mermaid-language/mermaid
<dandaman>	jaawerth: damn so I'm now totally lost :\
<jaawerth>	well you won't have to worry about any of that stuff unless you coded up interceptors or transformResponse functions, or you're working on a team and somebody eslse did
<deltab>	>> m = '123 Main St, Unit 200, Los Angeles, CA 90023'.match(/^(.*), ([^,]*,[^,]*)$/); m[1]
<ecmabot>	deltab: (string) '123 Main St, Unit 200'
<ezakimak>	are you sure it's the same data?? eg, where is it getting the keys from? "ridesharing" as a key doesn't exist anywhere in the console log output
<jaawerth>	I'd recommend isolating the problem and trying to $http call in an isolated base angular app
<jaawerth>	or even a plnkr if your API allows CORS
<dandaman>	jaawerth: nope, just me, it's a side project and i didn't add any interceptors
<Torqable>	NBhosting: mmmmm, yea, but it doesn't work great
<javascript448>	so like this?             return x.match(/^(.*), ([^,]*,[^,]*)$/); m[1]
<javascript448>	is the m outside of the line?
<sonthonax>	What’s the best way to do namespaced constansts in javascript.
<jaawerth>	heck, you could dump your JSON response into a .json file, paste it into yourdata.json on plnkr, and set up the $http call on plnkr and then we or folks in #angularjs could help debug
<dandaman>	ezakimak: there is only one http request that gets that data
<javascript448>	or m[1] is return
*	anth0ny_ is now known as anth0ny
<NBhosting>	i gues i can make a browser app that load it for each, but isnt something like that already out there
<deltab>	javascript448: return m[1];
<ezakimak>	dandaman, is this chrome??
<javascript448>	    x.match(/^(.*), ([^,]*,[^,]*)$/);             return  m[1]
<Torqable>	NBhosting: phonegap
<javascript448>	liek that ?
<dandaman>	ezakimak: yes it is
<NBhosting>	k
<dandaman>	lemme try firefox
<ezakimak>	chrome's console.log is *live*, if you changed the data even *after* calling console.log() on it, the changes will reflect in the dev console output
<deltab>	javascript448: var m = x.match(...); return m[1]
<sonthonax>	I have a large keymirror, and it’s getting unmanagemble. I’d like to be able to namespace the constatns in it.
<ezakimak>	serialize & deserialize it before sending it to console.log()
<dandaman>	ezakimak: same issue in ff
<Torqable>	NBhosting: warning: the results are not, and probably never will be as good as an app written in the devices naitive language
<ezakimak>	ff may also be live, i don't know.
<javascript448>	love ya :)
<dandaman>	ezakimak: ok lemme comment out my function that changes the array
<ezakimak>	just console.log(json.parse(json.stringify(data)))
<dandaman>	ezakimak: BINGO
<dandaman>	that was it
<ezakimak>	i've been bitten by that myself before. was a real headscratcher the first time
<JimmyJoseph>	Hello, can anyone suggest any good flexible form clonning library like sheepit but not sheepit
<jaawerth>	ezakimak: wait, are you saying it's *bound* or just slightly async? I knew about the latter but the former would blow my mind
<ezakimak>	jaawerth, ?
<jaawerth>	as in, I don't think all future changes to an object will be reflected
<ezakimak>	yes, they are
<ezakimak>	you can watch an object in the console live just like the watch window
<ezakimak>	set a timer to change it and see for yourself
<jaawerth>	ezakimak: http://plnkr.co/edit/4GsGcqK5FPZgwYVjgJkf?p=preview
<jaawerth>	no change there
<ezakimak>	i see that
<shoky>	ezakimak: it's not live, but it's captured at the time of expansion
<jaawerth>	yeah, taht
<shoky>	there's even a little icon you can hover over that tells you
<jaawerth>	it just isn't strictly sync
<ezakimak>	why isn't it captured at time of log() ?????
<ezakimak>	that is *so* *stupid*.
<shoky>	chrome has to appear to be smart.
<jaawerth>	maybe performance
<jaawerth>	so you can log huge things without blocking
<shoky>	that too ;p
<dandaman>	i dunno, that kind of defeats the purpose of logging though
<javascript448>	another favor.  how can i show a list of times in a UL LI list, where the times are live clocks and count up every minute
<dandaman>	you want to see the state of something at a certain point in the code :\
<jaawerth>	hey better than IE
<ezakimak>	s/kind of/completely/
<jaawerth>	which doesn't even HAVE a console unless the dev tools are up
<asteele>	yeah the semi annoying side effect: anything you console logged and didnt expand before reloading the page, cannot be viewed
<ezakimak>	that's only <= ie8
<jaawerth>	oh I thought it was 9
<ezakimak>	or maybe 9
<ezakimak>	you can shim it though
<dandaman>	damn, well im super grateful you have run into that problem before
<jaawerth>	and I thought 10 didn't actually give you anything, it just didn't silently error out either (though I could be wrong on that)
<dandaman>	i have no idea how I would have troubleshot that
<ezakimak>	no, 10 works fine
<ezakimak>	console always exists
<jaawerth>	ah
<jaawerth>	well..
<jaawerth>	good
<jaawerth>	when I first ran into that IE9 issue I was so infuriated
<jaawerth>	"my code is dying but nothing comes up in the log. *refreshes while log is open* wait now it's working. *closes log, reopens tab* now it's broken again and I have no errors! RAGHGHG"
<shoky>	hmm i was sure i'd encountered that console problem with IE11 even
<jaawerth>	easy enough to patch, but man what a design oversight
<shoky>	aye
<ezakimak>	yeah, that bit a team i worked with just last nov.
<ezakimak>	had the other devs baffled and the client furious
<ezakimak>	it's a 1 liner fix. i was a hero.
<jaawerth>	it's one of those things you PROBABLY don't know unless you've been burned by it before, heh
<jaawerth>	or someone was kind enough to tell you
<jaawerth>	or you're a microsoft employee
<ezakimak>	they didn't let me write it up in the bug log due to embarrassment though
<jaawerth>	ha!
<shoky>	lol
<ezakimak>	politics. bleh.
<ezakimak>	they lost the contract regardless.
<jaawerth>	I had it happen while I was showing an update to a client on one of the few client-facing things I've worked on here
<jaawerth>	she was pretty laid back so when I realized the console being open made it worked I had her do that so the other folks could show her the updates while I figured out what the hell was going on
<jaawerth>	it was pretty funny
<jaawerth>	I'd tested it in IE9 but I had the console open >_>

<giuseppesolinas>	hello
<giuseppesolinas>	I asked this question before but I got laughed at
<Sorella>	I think Babel allows you to use async/await in JS, which could make your code look less complicated. But Babel is pretty much experimental-quality stuff
<ljharb>	promises are fine.
<giuseppesolinas>	I'm trying to read properties from an "alleged" json I get from google swiffy
<giuseppesolinas>	I need some data stored in it
<episage>	ljharb: untill they grow
<Sorella>	ljharb: if you're not writing .then everywhere, sure :).
<ljharb>	episage: i'm not sure what you mean
<ljharb>	giuseppesolinas: JSON is a string. if it's parsed by JSON.parse without throwing, it was json. then, it's not json anymore.
<Sorella>	episage: you could also lift those methods into promise-land, instead of having .then chains
<ljharb>	episage: what do you mean "grow"
<ljharb>	and .then isn't that bad :-p
<giuseppesolinas>	problem is that it looks like it's not valid json because some properties are nested like obj= { "foo" : "bar", { "baz" : true }}
<ljharb>	giuseppesolinas: nesting is valid. that ^ is not valid json.

<ljharb>	episage: her code is smaller but i prefer the bottom tbh
<episage>	Sorella: what is the "promise land"
<jaawerth>	giuseppesolinas: that's invalid because { "baz": true } would need a key in front of it
<giuseppesolinas>	Ijharb : indeed, I get error when I try to access it
<ezakimak>	and you should
<ezakimak>	it's not valid anything

<episage>	nice presentation about promises
<episage>	http://martinezmediademos.azurewebsites.net/Presentations/From-Callback-Hell-to-the-JavaScript-Promise-Land/slides/#/
<episage>	Sorella: do you need Q to do that?
<ezakimak>	Q or bluebird or es6-shim
<ezakimak>	or one of many other promises libraries
<diamonds>	using lodash but
<Sorella>	episage: basically, that converts functions of the form `a... → b` to functions of the form `Promise(a...) → Promise(b)`, so `add : number, number → number` would be converted to `add: number | Promise(number), number | Promise(number) → Promise(number)`
<diamonds>	is there a super sugary spiffy way to return properties in an object with keys specified by an array?
<Sorella>	episage: you don't need Q, but you need to implement `Promise.spread` (which isn't that difficult).
<ezakimak>	iirc bluebird has spread
<Sorella>	It's basically: `function spread(args, f){ var that = this; return Promise.all(args).then(function(xs){ return f.apply(that, xs) }) }`
<ezakimak>	diamonds, something like extract() or pick()?
<ljharb>	you don't need bluebird for spread
<diamonds>	ezakimak: yeah like extract
<diamonds>	ezakimak: pick but multiples
<xckpd7>	where is the anti-promises article?
<ljharb>	`function spread(fn) { return function () { return fn.apply(this, arguments); }; }` and then `.then(spread(callback))`

<xckpd7>	yeah but there are some anti-articles about promises out there and I can't find them... we're basically discussing the whole es6 & promise movement, and then the people like Eric Elliot (and people knowledgeable on this channel) who are against them
<jaawerth>	episage: I see you've got "let". Is that full ES6, or TypeScript, or other?
<ljharb>	xckpd7: eric doesn't like "class" but i've never heard him dislike promises.
<Sorella>	Does anyone like 'class' tho
<natmyers>	what's wrong with promises?
<jaawerth>	there are very few people I know of who both understand promises and dislike them (Sorella is the only one I can think of off the top of my head)
<ezakimak>	well, from my conversations sorella isn't entirely against them--not in concept at least, am I wrong?
<ljharb>	Sorella: all the rubyists and java-ites do
<ljharb>	jaawerth: lol that was what i said :-p
<jaawerth>	haha
<ljharb>	like verbatim
<jaawerth>	well I stole that from the you of, like, last week
<jaawerth>	if you just said it above I missed it
<jaawerth>	but I'm ripping you off either way
<jaawerth>	OPEN SOURCE YO
<Sorella>	natmyers: conceptually, nothing, really. But several different implementations have different properties. There's relevant criticism to be made about the properties of these implementations, which happens to apply to Promises/A+ (implicit error catching, required async resolution, complected .then); but there are similar criticisms to be made about Scala's
<Sorella>	promises, Java's futures, AliceML's promises, etc.
<Sorella>	Scala's futures and promises*
<ljharb>	jaawerth: i forgot to gpl my irc comments
<hetii>	Hi
<hetii>	I try to display from react-calendar a <Month date={moment()} modifiers={{current: true}} /> but the days are in one horizontal line  I`m not sure how to use default botstrap theme for this calendar component
<jaawerth>	episage: https://gist.github.com/jaawerth/0fc386dd149bf6c054e9
<jaawerth>	episage: couple things: if you're using TypeScript or something that isn't a full ES6 environment, my used of rest parameters on line 12 won't work. Also, I noticed you weren't using results[0] in your version - if that was on purpose, you'd need to either pop a value from results or do new Snippet(location, ...results.slice(1)) instead of just ...results
<Sorella>	natmyers: I wrote some of my complaints about Promises/A+ here: http://robotlolita.me/2013/06/28/promises-considered-harmful.html, some of that isn't relevant anymore though. In particular, Bluebird has shown that it's possible to do really well with optimising Promises/A+ despite the required asynchronous resolution (and as a side-effect, Promises/A+ make
<Sorella>	it impossible to have stack overflow errors from chaining several synchronous promises, so that's nice). It does take some effort though, and fairly specialised code.
<natmyers1>	sorry I dropped for a second there
<jaawerth>	Sorella: also it's async so even without bluebird, the perf loss would have to be realllly bad for it to be particularly relevant
<Sorella>	jaawerth: it uses results[1], results[0], results[2], results[3]
<jaawerth>	yeah, I wasn't sure if that was on purpose though
<Sorella>	So you can just rearrange
<jaawerth>	ohh wait
<diamonds>	ezakimak: http://jsbin.com/jesaqubifi/2/edit?js,console
<jaawerth>	derp I missed the results[0] bit
<diamonds>	sorta messy example but you get it I assume
<episage>	jaawerth: i use the results[0] at line 17 and Im wondering if the location variable at the same line will actually hold a correct reference
<Sorella>	jaawerth: oh, yes. With strictly asynchronous things you don't see any difference, because the overhead of the asynchronous computation shadows that scheduling completely
<episage>	Sorella: your code is wicked im still analysing it
<jaawerth>	episage: yeah, updated my gist per Sorella's comment
<episage>	jaawerth: its mixed results[1] then [0] then [2] then [3]
<episage>	k
<jaawerth>	episage: yeah, I just swapped lines 4 and 5 in the array
<jaawerth>	as for the reference, I'm not sure I follow
<ezakimak>	diamonds, yep.
<ezakimak>	that's not what I thought you wanted though
<diamonds>	yeah didn't describe it well
<Sorella>	jaawerth: you need to replace this: [isAdPromise, blueTextPromise, greenUrl, descriptionPromise], by "results" :P
<diamonds>	easier to just write it :p
<jaawerth>	god I'm so blind right now
<jaawerth>	hahaha
<jaawerth>	WELL THE CONCEPT IS SOUND
<Sorella>	Ahaha
<Sorella>	Yeah
<Sorella>	It's basically lift4M :D, but you're passing an array there
<jaawerth>	episage, Sorella: updated (and changed the upper "results" array to "queries" to avoid confusion (plus they aren't results until those promise are resolved anyway)
*	nosuni_ is now known as nosuni
*	knod is now known as knod_away
<diamonds>	ezakimak: that sorta stuff ^ makes me yearn for fat arrows
<Sorella>	If Promise.all([Promise(1), 1]).then((a, b) => a + b) correctly results in Promise(2), you can simplify that with spread
<diamonds>	is there an es6 bin?
*	Artpicre is now known as Guest59807
<ezakimak>	how do you save/fork that jsbin?
<ezakimak>	http://jsbin.com/xecedimupu/2/edit
<ezakimak>	that's what i thought you meant
<diamonds>	ezakimak: oh that's maybe a better way?
<ezakimak>	it's not the same result
<diamonds>	yeah but http://jsbin.com/jigenemedo/1/edit?js,console
<jaawerth>	episage: if you aren't using a full ES6 like babel or traceur, you'd just want to change the "...results" bit - I can give you a function for applying an array to a constructor with "new" if you need it
<jaawerth>	(which I totally stole by using toString() on a transpiled babel function that uses rest args with a constructor, heh
<ezakimak>	diamonds, yah that too
<ljharb>	Sorella: no, it won't
<episage>	jaawerth: what is the function?
<Sorella>	ljharb: ah, you'd need to map it into promises then
<diamonds>	sorry to repeat but there must be one : is there an es6bin?
<diamonds>	like a site like jsbin
<socialblogsite>	Is there an equivalent for the @symbol to ignore undefined variables? I’m trying to assign variables with or, like var = var1 || or var2 || var3; EXACTLY to avoid many IFs, and when they are undefined it doesn’t wor. Why is that even possible if the undefined ones are gonna break it? It either doesn’t make sense, or I’m using it wrong.
<Sorella>	Or just lift `location`
<episage>	jaawerth: that's smart putting them all into an array
<jaawerth>	function newRest(constr, args) { return new (constr.bind.apply(constr, [null].concat(args)))()
<diamonds>	whet http://jsbin.com/yotucu/1/embed?js,output
<Sorella>	socialblogsite: why do you have undefined variables?
<socialblogsite>	sorry, I meant var = var1 || var2 || var3 (without the or)
<diamonds>	lol ^
<diamonds>	nice
<jaawerth>	er, that's bad syntax
<jaawerth>	one sec
*	Falstaff__ is now known as Falstaff_
<socialblogsite>	because I’m trying to make my code short. without veriying AND using them in two seperate steps.
<falafel>	socialblogsite, not sure what you mean.... the || operator is short-circuiting, it has nothing to do with variables, but with values, if the value is falsy, it will evaluate the right hand expression, and "undefined" is falsy
<diamonds>	ok that doesn't really work
<socialblogsite>	anyway. Is there something to IGNORE the undefined ones? (like the @ in PHP)
<Sorella>	socialblogsite: you're not going to make your code any shorter by not declaring your variables. In fact, you'll get the exact opposite. Plus your code will be very prone to failures. If you want to do code golf, use Perl
<jaawerth>	>> function newRest(constr, args) { return new (constr.bind.apply(constr, [null].concat(args)))(); }; function Foo(a, b, c) { this.a =a; this.b=b; this.c=c; }; newRest(Foo, ['Moe', 'Larry', 'Curly']);
<ecmabot>	jaawerth: (object) {a: 'Moe', b: 'Larry', c: 'Curly'}
<jaawerth>	episage: ^
<SmashingX2>	how can I show a red message at the top of a html form if a certain field is empty?
<falafel>	socialblogsite, no, that in PHP is a terrible antipattern as well
<falafel>	@ in PHP is no good
<jaawerth>	episage: I'd actually change that so it isn't explicitly returning, maybe a "restify" function that simply does the .bind.apply and returns the bound function
<SmashingX2>	either at the top of the form or just next to the input box that is empty?
<socialblogsite>	ok, I’ll declare them as “”.
<diamonds>	oh shoot you just pick 6to5 on jsbin
<falafel>	socialblogsite, why? "" is falsy too
<episage>	jaawerth: that's wicked. thanks man!!
<socialblogsite>	cool
<doc|work_>	SmashingX2: search for javascript form validation
<socialblogsite>	thanks
<Sorella>	socialblogsite: var a, b, c, d; d = a || b || c;
<jaawerth>	>> function restify(constr, args) { return constr.bind.apply(constr, [null].concat(args)); }; function Foo(a, b, c) { this.a =a; this.b=b; this.c=c; }; new restify(Foo, ['Moe', 'Larry', 'Curly'])()
<ecmabot>	jaawerth: undefined
<episage>	that [null].concat looks like vodoo magic
<ezakimak>	why would [null].concat differ from [].concat? why does one item matter?
<jaawerth>	I screwed up that second one, heh
<MistahKurtz>	>> [null].concat('sup')
<ecmabot>	MistahKurtz: (object) [null, 'sup']
<jaawerth>	anyway, the null is because you're using .apply on the .bind
<ezakimak>	oh, i see.
<ezakimak>	to bind()
<MistahKurtz>	>>[].concat(null)
<ecmabot>	MistahKurtz: (object) [null]
<jaawerth>	you don't want to set "this" to anything on the applies bind
<ljharb>	Sorella: no i mean, Promise.all resolves with an array of results
<MistahKurtz>	how's it differ?
<jaawerth>	applied*
<ljharb>	Sorella: you'd need `Promise.all([Promise(1), 1]).then(spread((a, b) => a + b))`
<ljharb>	Sorella: the results array correlates to the promises array.
<Sorella>	ljharb: oh
<Sorella>	Ah, yeah, you'd need spread
<jaawerth>	oh, I just needed more parenthesis around the restify call because of "new's" weirdness
<jaawerth>	>> function restify(constr, args) { return constr.bind.apply(constr, [null].concat(args)); }; function Foo(a, b, c) { this.a =a; this.b=b; this.c=c; }; new (restify(Foo, ['Moe', 'Larry', 'Curly']))()
<ecmabot>	jaawerth: (object) {a: 'Moe', b: 'Larry', c: 'Curly'}
<falafel>	jaawerth, yeah, `new (ctor.bind.apply(ctor, [null, ...as]))`
<ljharb>	Sorella: of course, if you had an array of numbers, you'd do `.then(sum)` :-)
<ezakimak>	what is the point of this restify()?
<ljharb>	Sorella: where `function sum(arr) { return arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b); }`
<falafel>	ezakimak, apply constructors with dynamic arguments
<woodennails>	Hello guys, of backbone, ember or angular.. which one would you recommend to really sink some time in to>
<woodennails>	and learn*
<jaawerth>	sorry, "spreadify" is what it really is
<jaawerth>	bleh
<woah>	react
<jaawerth>	anyway, it's the ES5 equivalent of doing new SomeConstructor(...args)
<woah>	if not react, backbone
<woodennails>	woah why react? im looking for some more MVC rather than just the views
<jaawerth>	so you can use new with .apply, basically
*	Zak is now known as Guest3834
<ljharb>	jaawerth: that's the only thing the spread operator gives you that's not sugar
<woah>	woodennails: you don't really need a bunch of mvc stuff with react
<jaawerth>	ljharb: yeah. it's useful though, and that up there is a useful utility for doing it without spread operator
<falafel>	new Ctor(...as)
<jaawerth>	thanks, babel! thanks, fn.toString()!
<Torqable>	I think spread is nice
<ezakimak>	but you already have args inside a ctor

<ljharb>	jaawerth: you can't actually do it that way tho.
<diamonds>	ezakimak: http://jsbin.com/qafogoruqo/1/edit?js,console

<falafel>	nice
<ezakimak>	so change your constructor property
*	lanceball is now known as lance|afk
<jaawerth>	ljharb: instanceof is LIES
<falafel>	I wonder what Babel compiles that too, lemme see
<jaawerth>	but you're right
<jaawerth>	b> fn = (Ctor, args) => new Ctor('arg1', ...args); fn.toString()
<babelbot>	jaawerth: function (Ctor, args) {   return _applyConstructor(Ctor, ["arg1"].concat(_toConsumableArray(args))); }
<jaawerth>	see, I stole it right from babel, heh
<ljharb>	i know instanceof is lies. but it still has to work :-)
<jaawerth>	oh weird
<falafel>	I get something different, with a _classCallCheck helper
<jaawerth>	yours looks different from mine
<ezakimak>	i make factories all the time that manipulate constructor so that instanceof is useful to me
<jaawerth>	my repl outputs 'function (Ctor, args) {\n  return new (_bind.apply(Ctor, [null].concat([\'arg1\'], _toConsumableArray(args))))();\n}'
<falafel>	the it does `new (_.bind.apply(C, [null].concat([1,2,]))()`, makes sense, it is basically what I've been doing in ES5
<jaawerth>	and _bind is simply a separated bind (aka var bind = Function.prototype.bind)
<jaawerth>	ljharb: it shouldn't be much extra code to account for instanceOf though
<ezakimak>	diamonds, do you need to handle non-existent keys in the typesSelected?
<diamonds>	nah but good q
<ezakimak>	you'll get undefineds in your output otherwise
<ljharb>	jaawerth: instanceof lowercase. and you can't "account" for it here
<ljharb>	jaawerth: it is *impossible* to use apply with new, and not have any caveats/warts, prior to es6' spread operator.
<falafel>	ljharb, instanceof will work afaik
<jaawerth>	actually
<jaawerth>	yeah
<jaawerth>	it works
<jaawerth>	>> function spreadify(Ctor, args) { var Bound = Ctor.bind.apply(Ctor, [null].concat(args)); return Bound; }; function Foo(a, b, c) { this.a =a; this.b=b; this.c=c; }; var obj = new (spreadify(Foo, ['Moe', 'Larry', 'Curly']))(); obj instanceof Foo;

<falafel>	there
<jaawerth>	beatcha to it ;-)
<falafel>	ah! :P
<ezakimak>	why all that fuss to use new when you can just use Object.create() and dress it up any way you like?
<falafel>	ezakimak, yup...
<ezakimak>	or just write any factory you want
<falafel>	the joys of JS
<jaawerth>	Object.create aint always preferable
<falafel>	But you can make your own thing with Object.create, and API you want
<falafel>	no `new`
<jaawerth>	yeah, sure. and I use it in my own code much of the time
<falafel>	I'd rather do `Ctor.new` and it solves the problem of applying dynamic arguments right away
<jaawerth>	but third party code gonna third party
<falafel>	[as, bs].map(apply(F))
<falafel>	boom
<falafel>	[as, bs].map(apply(F.new))
<ezakimak>	new FunkyWrapper(ActualCtor, args...)) is more typing anyways, just make a factory named newActualCtor()
<ljharb>	jaawerth: i don't think that works on all engines
<ezakimak>	you can make a factory to create the ActualCtor also, to provide extra semantics as desired
*	Tritonio_ is now known as Tritonio
<jaawerth>	ljharb: I'll always defer to you on that stuff, but I'd point out that spreadify up there is basically a direct rip of how babel does it
<jaawerth>	so if that doesn't work on all engines, then babel's spread params won't either
<ljharb>	fair
<ljharb>	babel does lots of things that don't actually work on all browsers tho.
<jaawerth>	I use it more in node than browsers
<ljharb>	that does seem to have minimal warts, tbf
<ljharb>	right, in node you can transpile whatever you want
<ljharb>	it's a server
<jaawerth>	but I'll give them a certain degree of faith that they do rigorous testing... granted I'd want to take a look at gh issues before using it in a browser (plus I'd want to run some browser tests myself)
<jaawerth>	I've also found a few bugs myself in using it
<jaawerth>	(more with babel-node than actual babel)
<jaawerth>	(why the hell won't you pass --harmony_generators on to node, babel-node? WHY?!)
<afmza>	is it good practice using: var self = this; or only where required?
<ljharb>	lol because "harmony" flags are hugely unstable
<ljharb>	afmza: only where required? but also ideally you avoid "this" entirely

<Sorella>	Just because $(...) isn't always inlined
<ljharb>	Backbone does that by `Backbone.View.prototype.$ = function () { return this.$el.find.apply(this.$el, arguments); }`
<domino14>	yes, thus limiting the scope to this.$el
<Havvy>	ljharb:  Why is it slower? Is it because $ is megamorphic?
<Sorella>	rcyr: not yet. I'll be working on it starting this weekend (I'm on paid leave from this weekend to mid June)
<ljharb>	Havvy: i believe that's so, but i'd have to look at jquery's code to be sure
<Sorella>	domino14: as much as `function $(self){ return self.$el.find.apply(self.$el, arguments) } does
<rcyr>	Sorella: Ah great, get some rest and make "mermaid" a reality
<Sorella>	Havvy: well, mostly because it uses apply there :)
<episage>	Sorella: what IDE do you use for debugging JS or similar?
<Sorella>	jQuery is definitely megamorphic, though. And $ is *SLOW*
<Sorella>	episage: Chrome, but with Node I use node-inspector
<rcyr>	Hmm, so it's official... node and io merge
<Sorella>	rcyr: yup :D
<rcyr>	Not sure if... good news
<Sorella>	Hmm, not sure why they'd be bad?
<rcyr>	yes/no/all these answers
<domino14>	ok, im not sure if we're arguing the same thing
<Sorella>	domino14: I'm arguing that there's no difference between `a.f(b)` and `f(a, b)` in JS.
<Havvy>	rcyr:  io.js's goal was to always fold back into node.js once certain community demands were met.
<asteele>	thats what was predicted, my total no-fuks-given approach was worth it this time!
<domino14>	i know it's all "loose", i'm just talking about coding standards, it makes sense that this.$('select') would limit to the $el in the backbone view holding that select
<domino14>	right, I agree
<Havvy>	Sorella:  That'd be true in Python, but JS goes out of its way to make it false. :(
<deltab>	or f.call(a, b)
<rcyr>	Sorella, Havvy : Io was created because joyent wasn't giving the community what it wanted... So now that they're back, will we see the next version of node before 2018?
<Sorella>	domino14: it also makes sense that `$(this, 'select')` would limit the scoope of `$` in an alternative implementation. Unless you're doing functions wrong (*looks at jQuery*)
<greenride>	I'm trying to run javascript tests using npm test. I would like to step through the tests using a debugger. What is the best way to do this? The tests are written in coffeescript and setup to use phantomjs-mocha.
<Sorella>	domino14: IOW, there are other (arguably better) styles out there.
<Sorella>	!g why functional programming matters @ domino14
<ecmabot>	domino14: Why Functional Programming Matters - University of Kent <https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf>
<Sorella>	^ if you haven't read it yet, that's a great read
<Havvy>	rcyr:  The next version of Node should be the integration between Node 0.12 and io.js 2 changesets.
<domino14>	thanks - appreciate it
<domino14>	do you like ClojureScript?
<Havvy>	And I'm hoping it's given a version number of 3.
<Sorella>	Haven't used it yet, but we use a fair bit of Clojure at work
<rcyr>	Havvy: I just hope Joyent got their things together.
<domino14>	i've been meaning to mess around with clojurescript + react/reagent
<domino14>	react looks cool af
<Havvy>	rcyr:  The io.js team believes they have, since the rules for allowing integration were based on Joyent getting their things together.
<rcyr>	<3
<Sorella>	domino14: React is pretty cool indeed. We're using it at work right now for a visual IDE for a distributed reactive data analysis/visualisation programming language, and it's been helping a lot with making the implementation simpler. The IDE and in-browser compilers/analysers are written in Sweet.js with a bunch of helpful ADT/pattern matching/monadic
<Sorella>	sequencing/etc macros though, not ClojureScript. The server, distributed VM, etc. are in Clojure tho
<domino14>	nice. sounds awesome
<JavaDog>	What does the function constructor do when you pass it a function?
<JavaDog>	I guess I could just try it
<JavaDog>	yeah, don't worry about it

<JavaDog>	Sorella: thanks, that's perfect for the project I'm working on
<Sorella>	JavaDog: v8 has fixed that bug tho
<JavaDog>	awww
<JavaDog>	So run this: http://pastebin.com/bZPCHJzR
<JavaDog>	this returns a string, right? how would you wrap that string in order to execute it as a function?
*	zz_robotmayo is now known as robotmayo
<cjohnson>	I would not
<JavaDog>	I'm doing super meta programming man
<JavaDog>	I need to be able to do this
<Sorella>	You can only execute code using eval. But that has its own issues, of course, including defeating all optimisations in JITs
<cjohnson>	no you aren't
<Sorella>	execute code dynamically*
<JavaDog>	The longer it takes, the better
<cjohnson>	I can't see any real valid use for this
<JavaDog>	It's not a real valid use
<cjohnson>	alright so you don't need to
<cjohnson>	so the answer is "I would not"
<Sorella>	(It doesn't need to be the function 'eval', just something that's going to interpret some code and make it do things)
<JavaDog>	Well it's a program I'm writing for my own entertainment
<cjohnson>	and if you're just bored, use eval. done
<Sorella>	If you're bored you can just write your own programming language :D
<JavaDog>	I use eval and it just returns undefined without printing anything like it should
<Sorella>	Then you can write a JIT VM for said language in JS.
<tach4n>	Sorella: don't drag others into your weird hobbies :p
<cjohnson>	JavaDog: no it shouldn't
<cjohnson>	there's nothing executing here. you're defining a function and that's it
<ezakimak>	i have a former coworker that wrote an assembly scripting language
<ezakimak>	^^ you need to call it afterwards
<cjohnson>	actually it's a syntax error
<cjohnson>	Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token )
<cjohnson>	but on top of that you're not executing anything
<JavaDog>	where's the syntax error?
<JavaDog>	I write things like this for fun, btw http://jsfiddle.net/1hj2ktLn/
<ezakimak>	ever write a biquine? those are fun
<JavaDog>	what's that
<ezakimak>	it's a program that's valid in two different languages
<ezakimak>	(and usually does the same thing)
<ezakimak>	but i'm not sure if the definition requires that
<deltab>	a quine is a program that outputs its source code
<ezakimak>	I've written a couple. The first I can recall was C and PHP
<JavaDog>	Oh okay yeah, I have heard of that
<Sorella>	tach4n: B-B-But it's all part of my world domination plan D:
<deltab>	but I've not heard of biquine before
<ezakimak>	that fiddle breaks the browser. lol.
<ezakimak>	ff at least
<JavaDog>	I wrote a program in Chef once https://github.com/culmor30/chef-moon-pie/blob/master/moon-pie.chef
<gtwy>	so does that fiddle just not load
<gtwy>	i just closed the tab
<ezakimak>	i have yet to do a quine
<gtwy>	it didnt break chrome
<JavaDog>	yeah it didn't work for me either, even though it's mine
<ezakimak>	it loaded then the whole tab went blank
<JavaDog>	I get the loading indicator forever
<JavaDog>	another favorite project of mine, especially in the winter https://github.com/culmor30/MD5-SuperCollider
<ezakimak>	expensive way to heat your home
<JavaDog>	not if your apartment is this small... :p
<ezakimak>	gas is still cheaper
<cjohnson>	JavaDog: the syntax error is what I just pasted to you
<cjohnson>	ffs do you even run your own code with the console open?
<JavaDog>	lol
<JavaDog>	drunk
<gtwy>	what is haskell for
<gtwy>	server side?
<JavaDog>	don't use it, the guy who made it just died so it'll never get updated
<tach4n>	it's for showing the other programmers who's boss
<zomg>	^
<cjohnson>	well the only language (ignoring a few exceptions) that runs in the browser is javascript
<zomg>	I prefer VbScript
<cjohnson>	otherwise, pretty much any language can act as either "client" or "server"
<zomg>	but seriously though you can use Haskell for pretty much anything
<cjohnson>	same technology stack
<Sorella>	gtwy: Haskell is a general purpose programming language, like 99% of all existing ones. You can use it to do anything.
<zomg>	hmm
<Sorella>	It has only started being used outside of academia recently though
<zomg>	I thought this was #haskell actually
<gtwy>	Sorella: does it need to be compiled ?
<zomg>	then I thought "what, Sorella is on #haskell too?"
<zomg>	and then it wasn't #haskell
<zomg>	lol
<gtwy>	zomg: lol
<falafel>	gtwy, you can runhaskell
<zomg>	oh, actually Sorella *is* there too, I've just never seen her speak there :p
<falafel>	gtwy, but yes, it is compiled for production if that's what you mean
<tach4n>	lol
<cjohnson>	Sorella is a spy
<cjohnson>	a narc
<Sorella>	gtwy: no language needs to be compiled. You can always write an interpreter for it. The major implementation of Haskell is GHC, which is a compiler. Then you've got runhaskell, which compiles and interprets your code
<Sorella>	zomg: I only speak occasionally there.
<cjohnson>	what's the semantic difference between interpreted vs compiled other than when the source code gets looked at
<Sorella>	Last time was probably last year :P
<cjohnson>	could you say an interpreter is just a realtime compiler
<cjohnson>	or transpiler maybe
<falafel>	or megatranscompiler
<cjohnson>	lol
<Sorella>	cjohnson: compiling is just translating from one language to another. Interpreting is taking text in a language and doing what it says.
<Felishia>	>> var html = "<div></div>"; html = function(){return html}; console.log(html);
<ecmabot>	Felishia: undefined; Console: function () { return html; }
<cjohnson>	so when somebody compiles haskell or C++, what is the language they're compiling to. asm?
<Felishia>	how can I make that work?
<cjohnson>	Felishia: what are you trying to do?
<Sorella>	Most interpreters have a compiler to some IR first, to make it easier/faster to interpret. But there are meta-circular evaluators that just go off the AST directly (Ruby also just interpreted the AST directly 'till a while ago)
<cjohnson>	don't use the same name for your function as your variable
<cjohnson>	>> var html = "<div></div>"; console.log(html); @ Felishia
<ecmabot>	Felishia: undefined; Console: '<div></div>'
<Felishia>	cjohnson, what about a way?
<cjohnson>	I fixed it for you ^
<Sorella>	cjohnson: could be anything, even multiple passes. GHC compiles to Core, then C (or C--?), then machine code I think. Might have dropped the intermediate C recently, dunno.
<Felishia>	html should be a function
<Felishia>	but if the dev inputs a string it should be transformed to a function
<cjohnson>	then you need parens after it. and you need a different variable name
<cjohnson>	I still don't get what you're trying to do
<JavaDog>	cjohnson: If you take the output from my function and paste it in the console, then it runs without a problem. so where is the unexpected ')' coming from?
<Felishia>	cjohnson, XD that doesn't work for my situation evil!!... html MUST be a function...
<cjohnson>	then you need parens after it. and you need a different variable name
<Sorella>	You particularly want to have at least one IR (sometimes you might have more, PureScript is considering a pure IR and an imperative IR) if you want to support more than one backend. Say compile to C, JVM and JS.
<cjohnson>	I still don't get what you're trying to do
<cjohnson>	if html is a function that you want to call, it MUST be followed by parens
<Felishia>	var _o_html = new String(html);html = function(){return _o_html};
<cjohnson>	JavaDog: no it doesn't
<Felishia>	parens?
<cjohnson>	Felishia: console.log(html());
<cjohnson>	if html is a function
<cjohnson>	Sorella: hrm
<Felishia>	>> var html = "<div></div>"; html = function(){return html}; console.log(html());
<ecmabot>	Felishia: undefined; Console: function () { return html; }
<Felishia>	same thing anyway :p
<cjohnson>	Felishia: "and you need a different variable name"
<cjohnson>	and no, that's not the same thing
<Felishia>	>> var html = "<div></div>"; var _o_html = new String(html);html = function(){return _o_html}; console.log(html());
<ecmabot>	Felishia: undefined; Console: (object) '<div></div>'
<cjohnson>	et voila
<Felishia>	object :o
<falafel>	new String
<cjohnson>	yeah, new String
<JavaDog>	cjohnson: http://i.imgur.com/uVrpzKB.png
<cjohnson>	which you don't need
<cjohnson>	var _o_html = html; works fine
<cjohnson>	I'm still completely baffled by what you're doing
<falafel>	^^
<Felishia>	really? I thought it would be a pointer
<cjohnson>	JavaDog: that isn't the code you originally pasted then
<cjohnson>	because it had a syntax error. and there was nothing running the function you defined
<cjohnson>	Felishia: what are you trying to do? take a step back and explain it
<JavaDog>	oh
<JavaDog>	OH
<noahmg123>	I don't have a probelm I just have a tip. Didn't know where to put it so I'll just put it here
<JavaDog>	I put a parenthesis in front of it
<noahmg123>	problem*
<cjohnson>	just the tip?
<noahmg123>	yep.
<JavaDog>	no problem
<noahmg123>	:) A few minutes ago it may have been a problem. But I figured it out.
<Felishia>	cjohnson, well it works :3 but basically it's a development lib... you create a JSON structure for an user that doesn't know about JSON to create JSON
<Felishia>	it populates html
<cjohnson>	wat
<noahmg123>	Felishia: what a coincidence my tip was on JSON
<JavaDog>	gay
<noahmg123>	JavaDog: was that for me?
<Felishia>	eg {"name":{"name":"Please insert your name","description":"Come on","types":{"type":"String","maxlenght":20}}}
<JavaDog>	I was playing off 'just the tip' from earlier
<Felishia>	opps theres an error
<cjohnson>	ok, so JSON to generate HTML Felishia
<Felishia>	eg {"name":{"name":"Please insert your name","description":"Come on","types":[{"type":"String","maxlenght":20}]}}
<noahmg123>	OK. I don't know that part.
<Felishia>	cjohnson, yes...
<noahmg123>	cjohnson: what are you trying to do?
<Felishia>	basically... and after the form is filled you get JSON back in the server
<cjohnson>	noahmg123: ?
<noahmg123>	cjohnson: are you trying to do something. or are you helping?
<cjohnson>	Felishia: cool, sounds good. where does the string into function stuff come in place
<cjohnson>	play*
<cjohnson>	noahmg123: helping
<noahmg123>	cjohnson: ok, got confused for a sec.
<Felishia>	:3 will show you
<noahmg123>	Felishia: what are you trying to do?
<cjohnson>	we're getting to that ;)
<Felishia>	http://pastie.org/10187755
<noahmg123>	ok
<noahmg123>	my json tip may or may not help
<cjohnson>	just say it already lol
<Felishia>	it's line 18
<cjohnson>	Felishia: oh, I see
<cjohnson>	yeah, how you have it is probably how I'd do it too. or thereabouts. if it's a string, turn it into a function that returns hte original value
<cjohnson>	however, you realize functions aren't valid JSON right?
<cjohnson>	so it will never really be a function
<Felishia>	cjohnson, that's the base of the base :p
<Felishia>	I creating the types
<Felishia>	http://pastie.org/10187756
<noahmg123>	Felishia: OK. Are you tring to take stuff and put it into JSON? Or extract data from existing JSON?
<cjohnson>	what are you trying to do noahmg123 ? :P
<cjohnson>	just read the chat history if you want to see what's going on
<noahmg123>	I just joined so I can't see before that.
<cjohnson>	Felishia: ok, just making sure you aren't trying to expect functions to come out of your json
<cjohnson>	you joined before Felishia fully described the situation
<cjohnson>	the situation is solved anyway
<cjohnson>	I was just curious what was going on
<Felishia>	I need to trasnsform this eg: {"name":{"name":"Insert your name","types":{"type":"Integer"}}}
<noahmg123>	OK
<cjohnson>	Felishia: cleverness is dumb though. don't use ~~ if you just want Math.floor
<Felishia>	to new XSTD.XSTDElement(new XSTD.Integer()).setName("Insert your name")
<Felishia>	cjohnson, copying from stackoverflow is dumb I know XD
<noahmg123>	cjohnson: anyway, my tip was on extracting json. when you use JSON.parse() you can add .section[array #].subsection[array #] and so on to narrow down to the data.
<cjohnson>	noahmg123: what do you mean
<Felishia>	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10834796/validate-that-a-string-is-a-positive-integer
<noahmg123>	cjohnson: example: https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json?origins=Riverview+FL&destinations=Tampa+FL|Valrico+FL
<Felishia>	>> Math.floor(Number("asdasd"))
<ecmabot>	Felishia: (number) NaN
<cjohnson>	>> ~~Number('asdfasd')
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: (number) 0
<cjohnson>	hrm
<cjohnson>	fair enough
<cjohnson>	but I would just use parseInt instead
<cjohnson>	>> parseInt('asdfasd')
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: (number) NaN
<Felishia>	no
<cjohnson>	hrm
<noahmg123>	cjohnson: when you run this: JSON.parse(document.getElementsByTagName('pre')[0].innerHTML).rows[0].elements[0].distance.value it brings up the first distance
<Felishia>	>> parseInt("20xxxx")
<noahmg123>	cjohnson: btw what is parseInt?
<ecmabot>	Felishia: (number) 20
<cjohnson>	!mdn parseInt @ noahmg123
<ecmabot>	noahmg123: parseInt() - JavaScript | MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt>
<Felishia>	parseInt is not string enough
<Sorella>	!parseInt
<ecmabot>	Sorella: If you want to convert something to a Number, don't use `parseInt`, just convert it to a Number using `Number(x)`. parseInt will convert it to a String, then extract the first numeric characters in that String that are allowed in the specified radix, THEN convert those to a Number. You only use it for things like parseInt('500 days of Summer') => 500
<Felishia>	strict
<cjohnson>	Felishia: yeah, parseInt works as long as it's not utter nonsense. and if it is utternonsense, you probably don't want to silently convert it to 0 anyway
<cjohnson>	I would just do Math.floor(Number(foo)) then
<cjohnson>	~~ silently turning nonsense into 0 seems bad
<Felishia>	yes same result
<Felishia>	prefer NaN
<cjohnson>	cool
<Felishia>	I just thought ~~ was some magic operator
<Sorella>	Felishia: it's just `~` twice, where `~` is bitwise negation
<cjohnson>	it's a bitwise
<Havvy>	>> ~~10
<ecmabot>	Havvy: (number) 10
<cjohnson>	yeah
<Havvy>	>> ~~"10"
<ecmabot>	Havvy: (number) 10
<cjohnson>	>> +'foo'
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: (number) NaN
<cjohnson>	>> +'10'
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: (number) 10
<Sorella>	Basically, ~0b1010 => 0b0101
<Felishia>	~10
<jslave>	Felishia: 10
<cjohnson>	more damn bots

<Sorella>	I don't mind it if they can change the trigger to something like `jslave: <js expression here>`. It's just annoying if people type a valid JS expression and some bot responds (with the incorrect result, no less)

<Yewbacca>	Hey I'm going nuts with this small problem... why is "yo" undefined? var foo = {}; foo.prototype = {}; foo.prototype.yo = function(){console.log('yo');} foo.yo();
<Yewbacca>	I thought prototypes were always scanned on all objects. Am I lackin something?
<Maxdamantus>	Yewbacca: because .prototype specifies the prototype of objects constructed using the `new` operator on the function.
<Maxdamantus>	Yewbacca: it doesn't change the function's prototype.
<Yewbacca>	Ohhh, so "new" basically looks at the prototype and copies references to become 1st class members, ie newobj.prototype.yo becomes newobj.yo
<Yewbacca>	Is that it?
<jaawerth>	no
<jaawerth>	prototypes aren't ever copied
<Yewbacca>	Well yeah it's a reference
<Maxdamantus>	`newobj.prototype` doesn't make any sense.
<jaawerth>	well, so are object properties
<Maxdamantus>	.prototype is a property of function objects.
<ezakimak>	because foo.prototype !== Object.getPrototypeOf(foo)
<Maxdamantus>	when you write `new foo()`, it constructs an object with prototype `foo.prototype`
<Yewbacca>	It's better if I explain what I am doing with some short code: function MyClass(initializer){ var self = { initializer:initializer }; self.prototype = MyClass.prototype; return self; } MyClass.prototype.foo = function() { console.log('foo'); }
<Yewbacca>	Basically something like that
<Yewbacca>	I am doing all this to avoid "new" in instantiating objects of my class
<jaawerth>	Yewbacca: think of it as a lookup chain. when you try to access a property of an object (function, value, whatever), the first place it checks is an object's Own Properties, then it will go to its prototype andl ook there, and then if that prototype inherits from another one, it will go yet another step, etc, etc
<Yewbacca>	So this is new territory for me (no pun intended)
<Maxdamantus>	Yewbacca: if you don't use `new` at all, .prototype is pointless.
<mintmoney>	what's the preferred paste service in here?
<Yewbacca>	jaawerth: Okay. That is how I originally thought it worked and it's why I added to the new object's .prototype directly
<ezakimak>	you want var self = Object.create(MyClass.prototype)
<jaawerth>	yes, that
<Yewbacca>	ezakimak: I did see something like that online and actually tried it but it didn't work. I'll try it agian, may have been an error somewhere on my part
<ezakimak>	or, you can use setPrototypeOf()
<mintmoney>	I'm going to post some JSON and need help accessing the value based on a specific key, but I'm going nuts not being able to access it... I feel it'd be quite easy for someone more talented than myself...
<ezakimak>	which you will need to polyfill for some browsers
<Yewbacca>	Yeah i saw all those setprototype/setproperty
<Yewbacca>	Thanks, I'll go do some quick testing with Object.create(mYClas.prototype)
<ezakimak>	!paste @ mintmoney
<ecmabot>	mintmoney: Show some code, but don't paste it on the channel. You can provide a test case we can run and help you with your problem with http://jsfiddle.net , http://jsbin.com , or http://requirebin.com . Sites like http://gist.github.com/ and http://bpaste.net are cool too.
<jaawerth>	it's also a bad idea to mutate a prototype on the fly, best to set that stuff in your constructor/factory/whatever
<ezakimak>	I wouldn't call mutating a prototype in a factory/ctor as on-the-fly but exactly where it makes the most sense
<mintmoney>	ezakimak: thanks!
<ezakimak>	ah, we said the same thing.
<Yewbacca>	Hah, the Object.create(MyClass.prototype) method worked. I tried that one about half an hour ago (yeah I've been at this for a while) and it didn't, so I must have had an error elsewhere. Wow, thanks.
<mintmoney>	https://bpaste.net/show/da896b45210f     can someone please show me how to store the value of the "message" key in a variable... I'm sure it's easy enough for someone more talented than I!!!
<Yewbacca>	var self = Object.create(MyClass.prototype); does however get rid of the ability to do var self = { prop1:1, prop2:2 } and stuff like that. I guess I need to assign each property one by one now instead?
<rcyr>	Yewbacca: You can use the second argument of Object.create if you like property descriptors :( Or you could get a Object.assign shim
<ezakimak>	or use setPrototypeOf after using object literal notation
<Yewbacca>	rcyr: Ahh. That's kind of cool. using descriptors is a lot more verbose but does have some benefits (writable/readable etc)
<Yewbacca>	ezakimak: Doh, I could just do var self = { ... }; self.setPrototypeOf(MyClass.prototype)?
<rcyr>	Yewbacca: Yup... verbose is the key here, that's why they remain mostly unused
<ezakimak>	mintmoney, foo.invalidAttributes.email[0].message
<Yewbacca>	rcyr: Yup it does bloat the code hehe
<ezakimak>	Object.setPrototypeOf(self, MyClass.prototype)
<Yewbacca>	ezakimak: Was just an example to ask if the general idea was correct.
<ezakimak>	yes
<Yewbacca>	I am going to try that pattern now since I have loads of properties and switching to other assignment methods would be ugly and a pain
<mintmoney>	ezakimak: thanks! i'll give that a try...
<ezakimak>	mintmoney, that is extremely basic--you may want to work through some tutorials if you're having trouble with that
<ezakimak>	!eloquent
<ecmabot>	ezakimak: Eloquent JavaScript is a comprehensive introductory Web-based book with examples and a built-in interpreter. http://eloquentjavascript.net/
<phos1>	: My website loads in “broken” and then after a few seconds fixes itself when all the files are done downloading. Is there a way to fix that? It’s my javascript menu / slider breaking
<Yewbacca>	ezakimak: Beautiful! The setprototypeOf method works perfectly. Finally I can have my cake and eat it too :) Nice object notation and assigning a prototype.
<Yewbacca>	Thanks all
<Yewbacca>	ezakimak: Discovered a nice side effect: When I use function MyClass(){} MyClass.prototype.foo = ...; the users can't just do MyClass.foo(); they only get the prototypes on the object that did Object.setPrototypeOf( self, MyClass.prototype );... I love it!
<jaawerth>	in non-JS news, The Babadook is... *terrifying*
<ezakimak>	because .prototype is a regular property
<Yewbacca>	ezakimak: Yeah I figured it was something like that, it wasn't a real prototype on my MyClass. I think I am gonna rename it to make it clear it's not a prototype of MyClass.
<ezakimak>	it's just a template that new uses
<Yewbacca>	Ahh
<Yewbacca>	Now it's all clear. it's entirely bound to new
<ezakimak>	yes
<ezakimak>	new is the only thing that looks at it
<ezakimak>	you may be interested to know that js can't know what functions will be used as ctor's or not--thus every time you create a function it adds a prototype property pointing to a new, empty object
<Yewbacca>	Ah. And I am going away from all use of "new" since Node.js users are used to var newObj = MyClass(), without "new" anywhere in sight.
<ezakimak>	they're just using a factory pattern
<episage>	how to implement OR in promises? like findElement(params1) || findElement(param2) ?
<ezakimak>	findElement returns a promise?
<episage>	yeah
<andornaut>	Is there a simple way of running querySelector() on text content? Using jquery I could do $(text).filter('.foo') for eg. How'bout in plain JS?
<ezakimak>	findElement(params1).catch(findElement.bind(null, param2))
<episage>	ezakimak: nice!
<episage>	neat
<ezakimak>	depends on your promise lib
<ezakimak>	but they all have an equivalent
<jaawerth>	also, you can do some funky things with "new"
<jaawerth>	like, if you actually return an object from the function, that object will override the auto-instantiated one
<jaawerth>	(and since most things are objects, that means you can return a lot)
<ezakimak>	and you can also make the ctor have different behavior invoked plain or via new
<jaawerth>	yeah
<ezakimak>	or the exact same
<ezakimak>	the same is considered by some to be safer in case you forget 'new'
<ezakimak>	but some builtin apis are different on purpose
<jaawerth>	you can even make "new" unnecessary by doing function Ctor(arg1, arg2, arg3) { if (!(this instanceof Ctor)) return new Ctor(arg1, arg2, arg3);  // ... do Ctor stuff }
<jaawerth>	though that one is best not done without thought because it can potentially interfere with how people might use it
<ezakimak>	iirc instanceof doesn't work in the ctor, but you can test with getPrototypeOf(this) === Ctor.prototype
<jaawerth>	it works but it may not be reliable, that way is better
<ezakimak>	instanceof requires that Ctor.prototype.constructor hasn't been modified
<jaawerth>	though I haven't tried that one with inheritance
<ezakimak>	you can change constructor whenever. i use it to make custom error objects that all 'instanceof Error'
<jaawerth>	ah yeah
<jaawerth>	I've done that too come to think of it
<Yewbacca>	ezakimak: Thanks, I was able to find the pattern they use. Instead of exporting MyClass, they export a function that is basically module.exports = function(args) { return new MyClass(args); } ... that's glaringly obvious now that I think about it, doh. I wasted all this time making the main class function create a new object when I could have just hidden the "new" creation ;)
<ezakimak>	or instanceof another parent
<jaawerth>	it's nice to do, that way the only real benefit of using "new" is it saves you an extra function call
<jaawerth>	it'd also work nicely with that "spreadify" fn I wrote earlier if you may or may not know the number of arguments
<Yewbacca>	jaawerth: "it's nice to do": Which one? the last example with "return new"? Or my method of having a constructor that creates an empty object, assigns a prototype, and returns that?
<Yewbacca>	Because the method I use saves a function call
<Yewbacca>	so I guess you meant that
<jaawerth>	I meant the return new (the one ezakimak wrote), I'll look at yours though
<ezakimak>	using Ctor.bind.apply has one limit--you *must* remember to return this at the end, using new you don't have to
<Yewbacca>	Oh, I need to read the backlog of text
<jaawerth>	Yewbacca: oh, the empty object/setting hte prototype thing? Well, efficiency is a secondary concern here unless you plan on doing TONS of rapid instantiations, but typically mutating the protootype on an object is going to be slower than using "new"
<Yewbacca>	Hmm I don't see any code by ezakimak. But yeah I know of 3 methods to do this "new" hiding: "module.exports = function(args) { return new MyClass(args); }" (pros: hides all the real objects and you can't find the prototypes and call them directly, cons: nested function call). Instanceof method: Where your function checks instanceof and returns a new instance of the object with the same args if they didn't use new (pros: Works f
<Yewbacca>	Nobody uses new in Node, so it's jsut extra fluff-code)
<jaawerth>	Yewbacca: you have to use new with tons of node built-ins, I don't know what you're talking about
<Yewbacca>	And lastly, my method which was: function MyClass(args){ var self = { arg1:1 }; Object.setPrototypeOf( self, MyClass.prototype ); return self; } MyClass.prototype.foo = ...
<Yewbacca>	jaawerth: Well, check any library and most are var express=require('express'); var app = express();
<jaawerth>	those are factories, typically
<jaawerth>	wrapping the constructor, yeah
<jaawerth>	and, to your point, many of the built-ins use the instanceof I mentioned (they use instanceof instead of setPrototypeOf, probably because they haven't been updated for modern node versions that contain setPrototypeOf)
<jaawerth>	that is the if (!this instanceof Ctor) trick
<Yewbacca>	Ahh... yeah I know about that one, the downside is that it'll be a drawback since everyone will use this class without "new".
<Yewbacca>	And to your question about speed: Well this is a message-parsing class in a socket library, and messages come in rapidly, so it needs to be as fast as possible
<jaawerth>	right. it'll be slower, but 90 times out of 100 it won't matter
<jaawerth>	(that is, with the built-ins)
<Yewbacca>	Yeah with normal "make 1 instance and be done with it" I wouldn't care
<jaawerth>	Yewbacca: in thath case, you'd want to use new instead of something like Object.create or setPrototypOf
<jaawerth>	unless that difference has changed in more recent versions of v8
<Yewbacca>	jaawerth: Hmm... Yeah it would be more efficient with new, would let me directly write to this.something and wouldn't create a new object in memory to hold the new data... you're right... darn it.
<Yewbacca>	Think I should just say "screw what they're used to, you're gonna use new in this case!" ;)
<Yewbacca>	?
<jaawerth>	lol
<Yewbacca>	The thing is that if I write to "this" without checking if the new object was created with new, then "this" refers to the "document" of node ;) Would be a bad place to start writing stuff hehe
<jaawerth>	Yewbacca: it's not too hard to make it a practice if you follow the style convention of constructor functions having an uppercase first letter
<jaawerth>	which is a fairly universal convention
<Yewbacca>	Yeah I do, and yeah good point.
<jaawerth>	if you don't want to use the fallback tricks ezakimak and I were talking about, you could flip it around and make them throw an error if "new" wasn't invoked
<Yewbacca>	regarding writing to "this" without making sure it's a new object, I might check instanceof and throw an error (I don't wanna wrap the "return new" stuff for them, it's bad to encourage idiocy)
<Yewbacca>	haha we said the same thing
<jaawerth>	yeah, that's more or less what ES6 classes do natively (which is actually kind of annoying in some cases)
<Yewbacca>	I'll do exactly that. I'll make sure all my constructors make sure it's a new object, everywhere.
<Yewbacca>	Hah nice to hear
<jaawerth>	(because if you want to inherit from ES6 classes, you HAVE to do so in another ES6 class barring maybe working around it with Object.crate or setPrototypeOf (which may or may not always work, sometimes the hprototype functions won't work if the constructor hasn't run)
<Yewbacca>	Ahh that's annoying actually
<jaawerth>	^that being on account of you can't do InheritedCtor.call(this, arg1, arg2...)
<jaawerth>	since it'll throw the error
<jaawerth>	yeah, ES6 classes kinda suck. The only thing they're good for is subclassing builtins you can't normally subclass like Array
<Yewbacca>	I am going to check if "this instanceof MyClass" works in constructors, otherwise ezakimak suggested "getPrototypeOf(this) === Ctor.prototype"
<jaawerth>	it's probably better to use the getPrototypeOf approach to be honest
<jaawerth>	instanceof will sometimes lie
<Yewbacca>	Really? I thought getprototype would be the liar (if prototype was changed)
<Yewbacca>	instanceof always seems to return the base name of the function that created the object
<jaawerth>	Yewbacca: IIRC the mdn article about instanceof covers some of the failure cases
<jaawerth>	!mdn instanceof Yewbacca
<ecmabot>	jaawerth: No search results found.
<jaawerth>	!mdn instanceof @Yewbacca
<ecmabot>	Yewbacca: instanceof - JavaScript | MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/instanceof>
<jaawerth>	ecmabot may have stuff to say too actually
<jaawerth>	!instanceof
<jaawerth>	no? hm
<Yewbacca>	jaawerth: I see, it is always an instance of Object and any inherited classes
<Yewbacca>	Btw I am setting up a benchmark and will know soon if it's better to use new or {} / setPrototypeOf
<Yewbacca>	Because I really like the latter for some reason
<Yewbacca>	jaawerth: I did this hastily: http://pastebin.com/6q3nHksw
<Yewbacca>	Seems to say Iterations:100000 Create Object: 25ms New Operator: 4ms
<Yewbacca>	So even with the "instanceof" check/throw error if not new, it's still 6x faster
<Yewbacca>	Cool
<jaawerth>	Yewbacca: that sounds about right, but keep in mind that those micro-benchmarks aren't going to have much relationship to behavior in real-world situations
<Yewbacca>	Just for fun, 100 million: Iterations:100000000 Create Object: 19188ms New Operator: 1651ms
<Yewbacca>	~11.6x faster
<Yewbacca>	Yeah that's true and I even considered using my method because the expected rate of messages is max 1000 per second. This just dealt with 100 million in 11 seconds
<jaawerth>	Yewbacca: modern JS engines are very contextual in their optimizations, and sometimes you can get totally different results from a micro-benchmark like that once you actually profile in the real-world app
<jaawerth>	still, in this case I would never expect the other way to be faster
<Yewbacca>	Yeah I just wanted to know how much slower it was gonna be. ;)
<jaawerth>	hehe
<Yewbacca>	But of course this just tests the "object creation" speed.
<Yewbacca>	It doesn't take into account all the init work I will be doing.
<Yewbacca>	With that, it may end up being a super tiny difference
<jaawerth>	IIRC (again, unless this has changed since 2013 when I last looked at it), Object.create is actually doing stuff and then also invokes "new" under the hood
<jaawerth>	so as long as that's true it'll never be faster
<Yewbacca>	Ahhh
<jaawerth>	but that may not be the case anymore, you'd have to ask someone who knows more about engines than I do
<jaawerth>	(but evidently they're all asleep or doing other things atm, hehe)
<Yewbacca>	I don't use object.create though
<jaawerth>	yeah
<jaawerth>	I'm not so sure about setPrototypeOf
<Yewbacca>	I use var self = {} and Object.setPrototypeOf
<jaawerth>	but the docs on that one have a big warning about how slow it is
<jaawerth>	it's really best kept for setting up inheritance and such
<Yewbacca>	Iterations:100000000 Create Object: 19188ms New Operator: 1651ms... so with setPrototypeOf method on a new empty object, you get .00019188ms per object creation, and with new to create the object you get .00001651ms per object creation
<Yewbacca>	We're talking nanoseconds here
<jaawerth>	!mdn Object.setPrototypeOf @Yewbacca
<ecmabot>	Yewbacca: Object.setPrototypeOf() - JavaScript | MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/setPrototypeOf>
<Yewbacca>	Ooooh you gave me a great idea through that link! It says that mutating the property with setPropertyOf is slow but that Object.create is fast (since it sets it on creation).
<Yewbacca>	Time to test! ;)
<Yewbacca>	Holding onto my pants now and hoping this will give some cool results
<jaawerth>	faster than setPrototypeOf, yeah
<jaawerth>	"new" is still fastest
*	DoubleMURT is now known as DoubleAW
<Yewbacca>	Yep but remember I want to get rid of new in the fastest way possible
<Yewbacca>	Uhh oh.
<Yewbacca>	http://pastebin.com/RreWeB2U
<Yewbacca>	Iterations:100000000 SetProto Object: 19233ms Create Object: 30634ms New Operator: 1370ms
<Yewbacca>	Create uses Object.create, setproto uses setprototype and new uses new
<Yewbacca>	The mdn specifically said Object.create was much faster than setprototype. I guess in their own JS engine but not in Google's V8 (Node)
<Yewbacca>	Odd
<jaawerth>	well
*	robotmayo is now known as zz_robotmayo
<jaawerth>	keep in mind they're talking about how modern engines optimize
<jaawerth>	and as I said, that changes *drastically* depending on context and app lifetime
<Yewbacca>	Ahh now I re-read it, they were talking about how fast it's able to call the prototypes?
<jaawerth>	well they don't get all that specific
<Yewbacca>	I just read the red box at the top and it talks about property accesses of prototype properties
<jaawerth>	but keep in mind that the more you reliably instantiate an object of the same "hidden class", the more a modern engine that uses JIT compilation is going to optimize it
<jaawerth>	but it isn't simply a function of # of instantiations
<Yewbacca>	Maybe I should turn it around and see how many .foo() (the prototype) calls I can do
<jaawerth>	yeah that's mainily it though
<jaawerth>	the speed of the lookups in the lookup chain
<Yewbacca>	yeah
<jaawerth>	Yewbacca: that's another thing to remember btw. When deciding whether to use a prototype or actually assign a property to the object, if performance is your worry (which I'm not recommending, since premature optimization is a code smell, hehe), accessing "own" properties is always faster than prototypes because it doesn't have to hop up the chahin
<jaawerth>	so it's a tradeoff between instantiation time saved + memory saved by not having to add additional references to the assigned properties (since it's doing lookups to the same reference) at the cost of lookup time when accessing vs the cost of the extra memory + constructor time when actually assigning the property directly
<Yewbacca>	jaawerth: The #1 concern is memory of the Node process, which is why I got into the prototype business to make sure the message parser's functions are shared. After that, it's making sure it instantiates fast using whichever method. And lastly, it would be NICE to get rid of new in a reasonably efficient way ;)
<jaawerth>	if you're instantiated a ton of objects then prototype is probably better, if you're instantiating a few and then calling the methods like crazy then assignment is probably better
<Yewbacca>	Yes, this message class instantiates for each received message
<jaawerth>	right
<jaawerth>	so yeah, prototypes win ;-)
<Yewbacca>	Yup :)
<jaawerth>	as far as gettinig rid of "new", you can either use the fallback trick or wrap it in a factory. the only downside to wrapping in a factory (other than the extra function call) is that it can get in the way of inheriting from the object sometimes
<Yewbacca>	mmm okay.
<Yewbacca>	Well I benchmarked 100 million function calls on a single instance of each object:
<Yewbacca>	Iterations:100000000 SetProto Object: 1248ms Create Object: 315ms New Operator: 319ms
<jaawerth>	Yewbacca: oh btw, again if performance is key, remember not to use any captured closure variables in your constructor/factory
<jaawerth>	that will slow shit down too
<jaawerth>	again, in most cases it's not an issues at all
<jaawerth>	but in your case it might
*	braincrash is now known as braincras
<Yewbacca>	I know what closures are and use them, but what does captured variables refer to? The ones that are "stored inside the closure"?
<Yewbacca>	I assume you meant those
<Yewbacca>	since they're bound to be slower to lookup
<Yewbacca>	Btw, the benchmark above shows that setproto was not worth the convenience of {} object creation. It's an insignificant slowdown of the calls, but still ;)
*	Torkable is now known as Guest66427
<jaawerth>	like, if you var foo = 'hi'; function something() { console.log(foo); }
<Yewbacca>	Yeha that's what I thought you meant, didn't know that they were called captured variables
<jaawerth>	Yewbacca: right, but again, as the MDN article mentions, you're going to get performances hits that extend beyond the actual instantiation phase in possibly unpredictable ways
<jaawerth>	uh I may have made that up
<jaawerth>	haha
<Yewbacca>	Well I instantiated each once and called the prototyped function 100m times :)
<Yewbacca>	But inheritance and stuff may slow it even more of course
<jaawerth>	I mean I think I've read that in places and it kinda makes sense but I don't know if that's the official term
<Yewbacca>	Ah, well I like the name for it, captured variables ;)
<jaawerth>	yeah but again, modern engines mean that doing that isn't going to actually represent what it will do in a real app
<jaawerth>	ljharb is better at explaining this than I am
<Yewbacca>	Ah yeah good point, it have optimized the crap out of that loop
<Yewbacca>	it may have*
<jaawerth>	or failed to optimize - modern engines do all kinds of wacky heuristics basedo n overall application context
<jaawerth>	not ot mention JIT compilation, where over an application's lifetime it will compile certain objects to lower and lower level machine code
<jaawerth>	(that is hand-wavy and probably technicall incorrect way of describing JIT compilation but it gets the idea across)
<Yewbacca>	Yeah but either way it absolutely convinced me to use Object.create and not {}/setPrototype.
<Yewbacca>	Now to run another benchmark
<Yewbacca>	What the balls
<Yewbacca>	I went down to 10m iterations to speed up the test, but this surprised me so much: Iterations:10000000 Create Object: 3027ms New Operator: 168ms Factory: 76ms
<Yewbacca>	The surprise was the tail end there; factory
<Yewbacca>	dual function calls yet it's the fastest
<Yewbacca>	Abbreviated test code here: http://pastebin.com/NeHeDJqD
<Yewbacca>	So wrapping the "new" was faster than using new. I guess the Node engine optimizes the function wrapper around new somehow, and doesn't optimize regular use of the new keyword in a loop as much
<Yewbacca>	I can't explain it... it's a quirk for sure
<jaawerth>	Yewbacca: it could be instanceof
<Yewbacca>	Oh good point! Let's try that
<jaawerth>	instanceof will actually look up the prototype chain for comparison
<jaawerth>	so it WILL have a cost
<jaawerth>	(but in my opinion is probably worth it)
<jaawerth>	or getPrototypeOf
<Yewbacca>	Yeah in this case it turns out it did cause that slowdown. After the change, I had to use 1 billion iterations to even see a difference: Iterations:1000000000 New Operator: 7280ms Factory: 7314ms
<GreenJello>	Yewbacca, if you want to run benchmarks, at least use jsperf http://jsperf.com/loopyclassthing
<jaawerth>	haha good point
<GreenJello>	or benchmark.js, which it's powered by, in node
<Yewbacca>	GreenJello: I am using node
<jaawerth>	someone may have even already done what you're doing in jsperf
<Yewbacca>	Hmm
*	Mmango is now known as AtlasTXSummer
*	AtlasTXSummer is now known as mmango
<GreenJello>	Yewbacca, then benchmark.js is recommended because it's written by people that understand JITs
<Yewbacca>	Yeah I am looking at it now and will download it
<jaawerth>	Yewbacca: by the way, I remembered why getPrototypeOf (or in this case, isPrototypeOf) is better than instanceof - getPrototypeOf will check your instantiated object's prototype against the constructor's prototype, whereas instanceof will check against .prototype.constructor along the chain - and .constructor can be overwritten
<Yewbacca>	Oh f-ckballs, benchmark.js killed my syntax highlighter and crashed an IDE with unsaved work :D No big deal though, I'll remember what I had done
<ezakimak>	not better, different. you could have two different ctors that both use the same prototype
<Yewbacca>	jaawerth: Ahh okay
<Yewbacca>	Thanks for that info
<jaawerth>	Yewbacca: if you want to speed up that checking btw, using .getPrototypeOf instead of either isPrototypeOf or instanceof will probably be fastest, since that will only look at a single prototype rather than running up the whole chain. The downside being it will throw errors for inherited stuff
<ezakimak>	all depends on what you mean to test
<Yewbacca>	ezakimak: Making sure the constructor's "this" is an instance of the class
<jaawerth>	again, I'd say the perf hit is worth it in this case
<ezakimak>	again, no such thing as *class* in js
<Yewbacca>	Btw instanceof worked, ezakimak . But this comment is good: <ezakimak> iirc instanceof doesn't work in the ctor, but you can test with getPrototypeOf(this) === Ctor.prototype
<Yewbacca>	ezakimak: you know what is meant when someone says that though
<ezakimak>	no, I don't.
<jaawerth>	getPrototypeOf won't work with inherited for the error-throwing (but it will for the fallback)
<ezakimak>	I can only guess. there are various definitions coming from one of several possible languages
<jaawerth>	I'd use this.isPrototypeOf(Ctor)
<Maxdamantus>	.getPrototypeOf is a mistake.
<Maxdamantus>	if you don't want inheritance, don't use prototypes.
<jaawerth>	I wouldn't go that far, but I'd say it's bad because if you're gonna usue a constructor + prototype pattern, people are going to expcet to be able to inherit from it
<Maxdamantus>	if you do want inheritance, handle subtypes the same way.
<jaawerth>	and you yourself will have a hard time keeping track of which ones you can and can't properly inherit
<ezakimak>	i'm a fan of factories for that reason
<jaawerth>	yeah, composable factories are nice
<ezakimak>	esp. if you want to insert more objects in your prototype chain
<jaawerth>	sometimes not ideal, but nice
<Yewbacca>	Object.create x 3,248,639 ops/sec ±0.27% (96 runs sampled) ... New Operator x 41,913,957 ops/sec ±0.38% (91 runs sampled) ... Factory x 70,292,573 ops/sec ±0.20% (96 runs sampled) ... Fastest is Factory
<Yewbacca>	I ran it with benchmark.js this time
<jaawerth>	or, heck, factories that construct wrapper objects
<Maxdamantus>	Yewbacca: those benchmarks can easily become meaningless.
<Maxdamantus>	Yewbacca: eg, if the implementation realises some operation is pointless and removes it.
<Yewbacca>	They helped me decide, actually. Node, for some reason, optimizes the HELL out of function foo(){ return new bar(); } as opposed to var foo = new bar();
<Yewbacca>	I tried this with benchmark.js and with my own manual timer and both times it was 2x as fast
<Maxdamantus>	again, it's extremely easy to make stupid tests.
<Yewbacca>	So var foo = foo(); (with the code above) beats var foo = new bar();
<jaawerth>	I'd say 2x isn't a meaningful difference in a micro-benchmark
<Yewbacca>	No it's not, not when we're testing constructor methods, maximus
<jaawerth>	that could easily reverse in a real-world situation
<jaawerth>	(not saying it will, but it COULD)
<Yewbacca>	jaawerth: Maybe. But at least it shows that it's trivial and very very efficient to use a factory method instead of exposing the object and forcing users to remember "new Object"
<Maxdamantus>	Yewbacca: what's the relationship between `function foo(){ return new bar(); }` and `var foo = new bar();`?
<Yewbacca>	Maxdamantus: I forgot a statement in the example; it's like this: `function foo(){ return new bar(); }; var foo = foo()` vs `var foo = new bar();`?
<ezakimak>	looks like your clobbering your namespace
<Yewbacca>	The goal was to identify a fast way to construct objects, with prototypes, and without the "new" keyword (users don't expect it)
<jaawerth>	ahh that'd do it
<Yewbacca>	ezakimak: Yes in JS sure, but not in Node. Namespaces only export what is in module.exports
<Yewbacca>	Oh wait now I get it
<Yewbacca>	foo = foo
<Yewbacca>	yeah that was not my real test code
<jaawerth>	also you're redeclaring the var repeatedly
<jaawerth>	in the loop
<Yewbacca>	The test code is here: http://pastebin.com/NeHeDJqD
<Yewbacca>	same code as I ran in benchmark.js later
<Yewbacca>	In both cases, factory was faster than directly calling new
<cjohnson>	!micro optimizing
<cjohnson>	this should be a factoid
<jaawerth>	indeed
<cjohnson>	but you get the gist :P
<Yewbacca>	cjohnson: Nono, it's not about that. I just want to learn once and for all which pattern to use forever.
<cjohnson>	performance should haven othing to do with it
<jaawerth>	Yewbacca: you're clobbering the hell out of "foo" in that test code
<Maxdamantus>	Yewbacca: you don't learn that from sketchy benchmarks that suggest one might be 2× faster than the other.
*	[1]Rou is now known as Rou
<Yewbacca>	jaawerth: Yeah? So? It's done in the inner loops

<cjohnson>	yep that's the one
<cjohnson>	 !perf
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: Are you experiencing performance issues? Have you profiled your code? If not, then stop trying to preempt possibly non-existent performance issues and just keep writing code.
<jaawerth>	haha there we go. that's more acerbic than detailed though
<cjohnson>	seriously though Yewbacca, performance is *irrelevant*. Go with the pattern that is easier to maintain, and clear to understand
<jaawerth>	someone should write a really detailed blog post about this though
<jaawerth>	and then we can link it from the bot
<ezakimak>	one had a link to an article that showed how jsperf could easily deceive
<jaawerth>	and by "someone" I mean ljharb
<Yewbacca>	jaawerth: ezakimak: I know it's a waste of time and that I could have used the "very slow" var self = {opts...}; Object.setPrototypeOf(self, blah); method, which was super slow over 10m iterations (something like 20 seconds), but was fast-enough for a single iteration. But I wanna get to the bottom of a nice pattern to reuse forever.
<cjohnson>	and if you are getting bad performance, profile. And I guarantee the problem isn't going to be your constructor pattern
<ljharb>	hm?
<ezakimak>	you're assuming that compilers won't change
<jaawerth>	Yewbacca: we aren't saying optimizing is a waste of time, we're saying micro-benchmarks are at best shots in the dark
<ezakimak>	one pattern that might be slightly faster today might be the slightly slower one tomorrow
<cjohnson>	and in the context of your application it might not even behave the same way
<jaawerth>	yeah, for example length caching in for loops
<ljharb>	Yewbacca: if you're concerned about either performance or clarity, avoid "this" entirely.
<ezakimak>	just use the pattern that makes the most sense for your *code*, and let the compiler writers worry about making it fast
<Yewbacca>	jaawerth: Well, anyway; I wrapped it in IIFE's and it cut the ops by /3, but the ratio remained the same Object.create x 2,869,585 ops/sec ±0.52% (99 runs sampled) New Operator x 16,285,905 ops/sec ±0.60% (96 runs sampled) Factory x 22,231,698 ops/sec ±0.62% (98 runs sampled) Fastest is Factory
<ezakimak>	jaawerth, yes, the article I'm thinking of talked about that specifically
<ljharb>	Yewbacca: how many ops are you running per second?
<Yewbacca>	var ljharb Yeah I call it "self" instead
<ljharb>	there's no way it's even 1000
<ezakimak>	today, in that context
<ljharb>	Yewbacca: no, "self" and "this" are the same. avoid both.
<jaawerth>	for (var i = 0, L = arr.length; i < L; i++) { } used to be widely considered "faster" than for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) { } and at one point it was
<Torkable>	var ljharb lol
<ljharb>	lol
<jaawerth>	because arr.length is a dynamic property, the idea was caching it would save that lookup
<ljharb>	that's C optimization tho
<Yewbacca>	var ljharb I said that earlier, it's in the range of 100-1000 and I knew that I could have used the dog-slow setPrototypeOf method and still had no problems. I just did this for my own curiosity.
<ljharb>	doesn't apply to JS.
<jaawerth>	but people ended up outsmarting themselves because engines ended up optimizing that
<ljharb>	Yewbacca: gotcha
<ezakimak>	found it: http://mrale.ph/blog/2014/12/24/array-length-caching.html
<Torkable>	wait cacheing the length works
<jaawerth>	it's a myth I tells ya
<Torkable>	but you shouldn't use for loops
<ezakimak>	we need to add that to ecmabot's vocab somewhere
<Yewbacca>	var ljharb What do you suggest instead of self/this? You mean "var hidden = 1; function getHidden(){return hidden;}"?
<jaawerth>	1) it's just an example of changing engines, 2) I agree that forEach is better than for loops in most cases but that doesn't mean NEVER use it ;-)
<Torkable>	lol
<jaawerth>	(especially with the advent of "for of", I love me some "for of")
<Torkable>	ok
<Torkable>	var ljharb is now a thing
<Yewbacca>	jaawerth: "for (var i = 0, L = arr.length; i < L; i++) { } used to be widely considered "faster" than for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) { } and at one point it was" I love that because I started JS programming in the 90s and always used to use the len = arr.length trick
<ezakimak>	"don't blindly trust microbenchmarks, they are often not measuring what you think they are measuring."
<Yewbacca>	Yeah, if the compiler optimizes something in a certain condition there's no way to guarantee it will remain that way
<Yewbacca>	everywhere else
<ezakimak>	we've got at least a dozen js engines in the wild
<ezakimak>	they all behave differently
<Yewbacca>	Good thing this is for Node/V8 and never the web then ;)
<ezakimak>	even node/v8 changes frequently
<Yewbacca>	Repeating this question: ljharb What do you suggest instead of self/this? You mean "var hidden = 1; function getHidden(){return hidden;}"?
<Yewbacca>	I wanna know what you were referring to.
<Torkable>	MS stuck their engine in did you peeps see that
<ezakimak>	it is arguably the most advanced, and most worked-on compiler in the world right now
<Yewbacca>	Yep true that ezak
<cjohnson>	!fp @ Yewbacca
<ecmabot>	Yewbacca: Functional programming: A style of programming which uses only pure (mathematical) functions, avoiding side-effects
<ljharb>	Yewbacca: i mean, avoid shared mutable state
<ljharb>	Yewbacca: meaning try to make everything be pure functions.
<ljharb>	!nouns @ Yewbacca
<ecmabot>	Yewbacca: In JavaScript, verbs are equally important as nouns. http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html
<ljharb>	fwiw i don't even know if caching the array length *ever* was faster.
<ljharb>	i think people just assumed it worked like that, because it was faster in c
<Yewbacca>	ljharb: Caching array length was just something that I learned in C
<ljharb>	right, it was faster there. but i doubt anyone profiled it in JS.
<Yewbacca>	but I assumed in javascript it was a "property lookup" where it found the array object and then the length property
<Yewbacca>	so may have been better there too
<Yewbacca>	But I bet they optimize actually "arr.length" to be equal to "foo", meaning dots don't matter
<Yewbacca>	Then again, maybe they constantly have to look it up to check if arr still has the property
<cjohnson>	Yewbacca, if you're interested in performance, write your code to be clear and maintainable, and then use a profiler on it
<cjohnson>	any other attempt at performacne before you've written it is wasted time
<ezakimak>	array objects are special, and internally (even before es5) properties could have custom getter/setters
<cjohnson>	it's...imperformant
<Yewbacca>	cjohnson: I agree with that.
<cjohnson>	;)
<ezakimak>	thus how length is implemented, not as a regular object property
<cjohnson>	alright so then don't waste your time trying to optimize a for loop or your constructor pattern or what havey ou
<jaawerth>	yeah I mean, the consensus nowadays it to use .forEach anyway, perf be damned
<jaawerth>	haha
<Yewbacca>	cjohnson: It came out of something entirely different, as these rabbit holes often do
<cjohnson>	alrighty
<jaawerth>	(though once for..of properly starts hitting we may see a return to native loops)
<Yewbacca>	I started out optimizing an object that included all functions in every instance of the object (instead of using prototype). Then I decided that since I had a spiffy new prototype system I'd check for the fastest way to get rid of the "new" keyword pattern, so users could just do var msg = Message("foo")
<ezakimak>	apart from O(n^3) algorithm problems, code clarity is most important
<Yewbacca>	and with that, I started looking into Object.create() vs new operator vs factory (function which returns a new object).
<jaawerth>	for..of + let = 1) easily loop ANYTHING with Symbol.iterator, 2) no extra function calls, 3) readability
<Yewbacca>	The fun part was the latter was faster in node/v8, by a lot. Probably not in all conditions, but at least it's great to see that I don't have to worry about the "extra function call"
<jaawerth>	only downside is it's less composable
<jaawerth>	on account of being syntax
<jaawerth>	Yewbacca: so the IIFE didn't make a difference?
<jaawerth>	(IIFEs plural, I should say)
<Yewbacca>	jaawerth: It just cut performance of everything by /3, but ratio was the same: Object.create x 2,869,585 ops/sec ±0.52% (99 runs sampled) New Operator x 16,285,905 ops/sec ±0.60% (96 runs sampled) Factory x 22,231,698 ops/sec ±0.62% (98 runs sampled) Fastest is Factory
<cjohnson>	doesn't matter
<cjohnson>	time for pizza
<jaawerth>	lol
<Yewbacca>	cjohnson: Haha. I had one earlier, for the first time in months, and decided it's the last one for me. :) Homemade food > pizza.
<ezakimak>	i ate a pizza amonth ago. felt sick for two weeks after
<jaawerth>	Yewbacca: if I had to guess I'd say v8 is optimizing the factory function itself (which I don't think it can do as well in more diverse, real-world situations), but I'm no v8 wizard
<cjohnson>	Yewbacca: Homemade food == pizza
<Yewbacca>	ezakimak: Exactly. All the fat and carbs made me sluggish
<cjohnson>	I just homemade one
<cjohnson>	don't assume
<Yewbacca>	Ah nice, those are much better
<ezakimak>	you'd have to look at the produced bytecode to know what it is really benchmarking
<Yewbacca>	ezakimak: Yeah...
<Yewbacca>	jaawerth: Yeah that was my initial guess; that v8 notices it's a factory function and does something to just speed it up to hell
<Yewbacca>	Replaces the function call with some "new" magic behind the scenes, maybe
<Yewbacca>	Either way it was great news, because I love that pattern!
<Yewbacca>	I'll export a factory, and thereby be able to use the "this" keyboard with total trust that it's the object, without needing to type check it
<cjohnson>	it's irrelevant though lol.
<ezakimak>	it might be an artifact of static analysis, free variables, etc.
<cjohnson>	just pick the one you like regardless of the perf
<ezakimak>	type check it?
<Yewbacca>	ezakimak: instanceof check it
<ezakimak>	why would you need to in a ctor/factory??
<ezakimak>	you're creating it there
<Yewbacca>	cjohnson: I like the factory method, and I like the Object.create method. But out of the two, I'd say factory is the slickest. Lets me directly use the "this" property and know it refers to a new object
<Yewbacca>	ezakimak: No, I said factories let me use "this" in the constructed object WITHOUT checking that it's the right object
<cjohnson>	yeah im not a big fan of object.create either
<Yewbacca>	Yeah
<Yewbacca>	The factory pattern is popular in node modules and now I'll happily use it, knowing it's optimized by V8.
<ezakimak>	but why would you ever need to check it?
<Yewbacca>	ezakimak: Because if they do var foo = bar(); and bar() doesn't check that "this" is a new object, then "this" refers to node's core object :P Bad idea to do this.something=blah; then
<Yewbacca>	Basically: var foo = bar(); means "this" refers to node's core object, and var foo = new bar(); means "this" refers to the new object
<ezakimak>	so it's a bug, it errors, and you debug it
<jaawerth>	right, perf wise both "new" and factories are good enough
<ezakimak>	but yah, that could be costly
<jaawerth>	the only ones to watch out for are on-the-fly Object.create and setPrototypeOf
<Yewbacca>	jaawerth: Yeah, equivalent, maybe even faster as factory (optimized somehow)
<Yewbacca>	Yeah object.create was a lot slower (but only on a nanosecond level) heh
<jaawerth>	minor differences are meaningless, the perf hits for Object.create and setPrototypeOf are specific to their internal behavior
<Yewbacca>	Yeah
<ezakimak>	and you're testing them in a loop--which gives the compiler more time to optimize. called ad hoc from places all over your code may not see that performance
<ezakimak>	and which is faster could be totally different
<jaawerth>	right
<jaawerth>	also optimization itself costs resources, and when your app is doing more things, it will prioritize differently
<Yewbacca>	ezakimak: Yep I'm aware of that; but the goal was to see what huge differences there were (and there were huge ones), since even though optimization will differ, huge slowdowns will probably stay the same everywhere
<jaawerth>	that's why it doesn't compile every hidden class to low-level code
<ezakimak>	not necessarily.
<jaawerth>	also: in many, many cases the actual instantion method probably isn't going to be the bottleneck
<ezakimak>	again, microbenchmarks freuqently aren't measuring what you think they are
<jaawerth>	it'll probably be the actual *data* you're processing
<jaawerth>	(which is the other downside of micro-benchmarking, even if it DOES do something with respresentative data, it tends to be so arbitrary as to be meaningless)
*	[1]Rou is now known as Rou
<ezakimak>	with such a short amount of code, very minor compiler choices can produce large outcome variations
<ezakimak>	add in actual production code for context and the compiler may choose differently--which difference if you could capture in the same micro benchmark would drastically alter the result
<jaawerth>	for some reasono "compiler choices" made me envision the compiler reading a choose your own adventure novel
<jaawerth>	which I guess it kinda is
<jaawerth>	hopefully it doesn't get stuck up an apple tree
<Yewbacca>	By the way, when using closures it's possible to have hidden variables, like "function b(){ var x; function foo(); return blah; }" (not a real example). Is it possible to do something like that when using a factory? Any variables defined in the factory function won't carry over to the new object
<ezakimak>	yah, and sometimes it gets to the same page multiple times
*	badon_ is now known as badon
<ezakimak>	hidden how?
<Yewbacca>	Hidden from the person who sees the final object
<jaawerth>	I think they mean private
<ezakimak>	you mean not accessible? sure
<ezakimak>	that's one of the reasons people use IIFEs
<Yewbacca>	I guess I could set up hidden/private variables inside my constructor, but they won't be inherited by prototype functions
<jaawerth>	yeah, in fact it's much easier to do in a factory than a base constructor, you'd just need to define the constructor (or the methods that'll go on the prototype) in the factory
<jaawerth>	however, like I said before, if you're trying to avoid perf hits, well, closures incur a perf hit
<ezakimak>	if you really want to get into nitty gritty, look through the bluebird code and see the lengths he goes through to avoid closures
<ezakimak>	it's highly optimized js
<erste>	Hi, about protractor, I've created several test-spec.js files accross my project, is there a way to flag in the spec.js to skip the test?
<jaawerth>	yeah
<jaawerth>	bluebird is crazy V8 voodoo magic
<jaawerth>	it's kinda mindblowing to read through it
<ezakimak>	when it really matters, that's the kind of stuff you have to do
<ezakimak>	but *until then*, just don't worry about it at all
<ezakimak>	you might end up measuring with a micrometer, marking with chalk, and cutting with an axe
<jaawerth>	ezakimak: one thing I have no idea about is just how all those v8-specific optimizations failover effectively in other engines
<Yewbacca>	ezakimak: !
<jaawerth>	like, if you browserify bluebird and use it in firefox
<Yewbacca>	ezakimak: I am looking at the bluebird code and he has some amazing ideas
<ezakimak>	he has carefully profiled and tested, painstakingly, with deep insight into how the vms work
<jaawerth>	for every engine?
<Yewbacca>	I LOVE IT!
<Yewbacca>	ezakimak: https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/blob/master/src/map.js
<ezakimak>	probably just v8 and spidermonkey
<jaawerth>	I thought it was mostly just set up for node, and to fail over to other engines
<Yewbacca>	I just found the pattern to use
<Yewbacca>	He module.exports at the top, and defines as many hidden/inaccessible vars as he wants, creates his functions, sets his prototypes, and he's done.
<Yewbacca>	Well... done... as long as it actually does what he thinks it does
<Yewbacca>	Not sure .prototype inside a factory actually works
<Yewbacca>	It may create a new prototype object for each instance of the factory
<Yewbacca>	of the factory function
<ezakimak>	yes, that's amd-style modules iirc
<jaawerth>	that works fine, only keep in mind that module-wide "private" variables are going to be global for every instantiated object
<jaawerth>	that isn't always what you want
<Yewbacca>	Since each of his factory calls create new "function X(); X.prototype.Y" all over the place, I am not sure he actually uses prototypes here.
<jaawerth>	ljharb also showed me a neat ES6 trick for doing private variables using WeakMaps
<Yewbacca>	They always create a new X function and set ITS prototype
<Yewbacca>	but doesn't mean they will be shared
<jaawerth>	but.. ultimately private variables usually aren't worth it
<Yewbacca>	jaawerth: Yeah perhaps I should avoid that nitpicking
<jaawerth>	it's typically enough to use an underscore and make them non-enumerable
<Yewbacca>	I could call it something like _private = {}
<Yewbacca>	Oh you mean the long-form property defintion thing?
<Yewbacca>	Object.setProperty or something like that
<jaawerth>	defineProperty
<Yewbacca>	defineProperty
<Yewbacca>	yeah
<Yewbacca>	You blew my mind. That's it!
<Yewbacca>	;)
<Yewbacca>	Finally a use for that
<jaawerth>	you can wrap it in a function that sets enumerable: false, writable: true, configurable: true, and pass value and the parent object in as arguments
<ezakimak>	https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/blob/master/src/promisify.js
<ezakimak>	there's some magic in there
<Yewbacca>	ezakimak: Gonna be a good read to pick up new tricks, thanks
<Yewbacca>	jaawerth: Smart, that cuts down on the verbosity
<ezakimak>	good to know they exist, but very few justifiable use cases for them
<Yewbacca>	Yup as always
<jaawerth>	also never use any of those tricks in your first implementation of something
<jaawerth>	that way lies madness
<jaawerth>	patterns like factories that wrap constructors are fine but a lot of the awesome bluebird stuff is also a readability kliler
<ezakimak>	yeah, make the program work first, the simplest way
<jaawerth>	and it's WAY better to write simple, readable code that works and optimize on another pass
<ezakimak>	right. those things were added as needed--because instrumentation showed where and why it was slow
<ezakimak>	it's now nearly as fast as CPS
<jaawerth>	also, when you write it in a composable, modular, readable way, HOW you should optimize becomes clearer
<jaawerth>	whereas if you try to partially optimize on the fly, when you go back later it's going to be a nightmare to refactor and figure out what the hell you were doing ;-)
*	[1]Rou is now known as Rou
<Yewbacca>	ezakimak: jaawerth: The only thing that mystified me about Bluebird was what I called out earlier; he basically does this: module.exports = function(){ function X(){}; X.prototype.Y = ...; }... But that just means every time he calls his factory function, it will create a new X and give that a prototype. It won't save any memory at all using his way of using properties
<ezakimak>	no, these are *modules* not factory functions
<ezakimak>	the modules get loaded once
<jaawerth>	Yewbacca: modules are cached
<ezakimak>	X is a constructor
<Yewbacca>	Yeah I know modules are cached. But ezak called it out: He probably has X as his constructor instead of the main function
<Yewbacca>	I was just thinking of how most node modules have the module.exports = factory/constructor function
<Yewbacca>	His one probably uses var module = require(...); module.somefunc() to construct instead
<ezakimak>	yes, it serves as a namespace
<ezakimak>	which can have private vars
<Yewbacca>	Right. I stopped using namespace tricks when I began using node since it loads each module into its own object under node.require{} (a cache of all loaded files)
<Yewbacca>	So I bloat the variable space as much as I want inside each module, since the only thing that leaks out is what I've set module.exports to
<ezakimak>	module and file don't have to be 1:1
<jaawerth>	Yewbacca: what's going on in that map.js page is decoration
<Yewbacca>	decoration?
<jaawerth>	the Promise constructor and such has already been defined, and is being passed into the function and decorated with additional prototype methods
<Yewbacca>	Dooooh, nicely caught!
<ezakimak>	aka monkey patching
<jaawerth>	ah yes, the more hilarious name for it ;-)
<Yewbacca>	Lovely name ;)
<ezakimak>	connotes better how unsafe it can be
<Yewbacca>	Yeah I am not gonna do that.
<jaawerth>	basically bluebird is so huge and complex that he's doing that to break up all the crap he has to put on the constructor into multiple modules
<ezakimak>	powerful, but it can trip you up
<ezakimak>	i've used it to great success when building APIs
<ezakimak>	for that very reason
<Yewbacca>	Yeah it seems he has so many functions on his main object that he wanted to break them up
<jaawerth>	yeah, it's useful for APIs, and on the client side it's useful for environment-sensitive method assignment, where you might use one method or the other based on certain thingsa and allow the excess to be garbage collected
<Yewbacca>	And since his modules need to access the main object I guess monkey patching is the only way
<jaawerth>	for example, angular.js uses built-in jqlite methods, but if jquery is detected, it will patch jquery over qjlite
<jaawerth>	jqlite*
<Yewbacca>	otherwise i'd suggest he makes each function (of the main library) its own module, and just uses index.js to set "module.exports.func1 = require(file1).func1; module.exports.func2 = require(file2).func2;"
<jaawerth>	(and save a few jqlite methods where there are API differences)
<jaawerth>	but that environment-detection stuff is dirty
<jaawerth>	and needs to be tested pretty thoroughly
<ezakimak>	here's one example: https://www.betterservers.com/control-center/app/lib/bsapi/Bsapi.js?release=9ae67de027344e10cc08d18665531b95c1e3e596
<Yewbacca>	ezakimak: of what? Monkey patching?
<jaawerth>	granted it can also be useful for mixins and a more functional/method dispatch approach to building objects
<ezakimak>	yes
<ezakimak>	see how init() and entityUses(ctor, ver) work
<Yewbacca>	Yeah I was reading that at the bottom, nice!
<Yewbacca>	The only part i dont get is define(function(require) {
<jaawerth>	like, instead of a constructor function, you have a bunch of methods, and varoius functions for assigning those methods to a passed in object. so you can compose various objects to combining and dispatching the various method assignment functions
<Yewbacca>	why require?
<jaawerth>	AMD
<ezakimak>	that's commonjs syntax for requirejs
<jaawerth>	bah
<jaawerth>	I don't like requirejs
<jaawerth>	it's too busy, it offends my delicate sensibilities
<ezakimak>	with commonjs syntax it's very nice
<ezakimak>	default syntax is terrible and anti-DRY
<Yewbacca>	I see
<ezakimak>	checkout the custom error object creation
<Yewbacca>	Btw I better get back to the code before I start forgetting things ;)
<Yewbacca>	Thanks a LOT for the information eza and jaawerth ;)
<jaawerth>	sure
<jaawerth>	I should probably give require a chance with commonjs syntax
<jaawerth>	(and also I should stop mucking around with ES6 syntax)
<jaawerth>	(but I like it)
<Yewbacca>	I'll still idle here but time to code now

<Yewbacca>	jaawerth: For your pointless information delectation needs: The final solution will be a factory function responsible for "new", a bunch of shared-memory prototype functions on the main object (yay efficiency), and a bunch of "defineProperty" underscore values that are non-enumerable.
<Yewbacca>	Thank you both ;)

<niggler>	oh maxxi those variables wont be visible
<niggler>	look at the example i gave above,
<Maxxi>	ok i will, btw i also tried this.x and prototype but it didnt work either
<niggler>	firstly, you didnt actually call the function
<niggler>	so none of the code within the function was actually run
<Maxxi>	but im returning a function (=object) and i defined properties on it, i dont get why i cant then access those properties
<niggler>	you didnt define properties on the function
<ljharb>	Maxxi: "this.x = 3" isn't a property on the function.
<niggler>	>> function myfunc() { return myfunc.x; } myfunc.x = 3; myfunc() @ Maxxi
<ecmabot>	Maxxi: (number) 3
*	phlix is now known as phelix
<Maxxi>	how can you return myfunc.x when myfunc doesnt even exist yet
<niggler>	the code inside the function isn't evaluated until the function is called
<niggler>	>> function f() { console.log("this will never be called"); } @ Maxxi
<ecmabot>	Maxxi: undefined
<Maxxi>	ok i think im getting it
<Maxxi>	is there any way to put functions defined outside into another one later?
<Maxxi>	ok nvm that works obviously
<ljharb>	arguments

<Havvy>	Lulz... /ctcp ecmabot version    gives a really weird response.
<mindstorm8191>	...ugh, I'm not sure how to code all this together anymore
<mindstorm8191>	anyone willing to provide some ideas?
<nkuttler>	what's the problem?
<mindstorm8191>	I'm making a spaceship game where, whenever you destroy an enemy ship, you can salvage parts off the ship to make yours stronger
<mindstorm8191>	right now ships are powered by engines ( / generators) that provide power; they slow down when demand is low to save energy, then speed up when they need more
<mindstorm8191>	and, up to now my only power consumer has been thrusters, controlled by the user (with WSAD controls).  Now I need to add in rotational thrust control, so that the ship will follow the mouse
<mindstorm8191>	...I'm thinking of either adjusting the minimum power consumption of the thrusters, or adding another power level for when the ship needs to turn
<PHPLearner>	hello
<foofin>	Hello!
<PHPLearner>	is it a bad idea to use a global variable in an application
<PHPLearner>	what could possibly go wrong if I use a global variable
<ljharb>	yes
<ljharb>	global variables are bad
<ljharb>	part of your program could unintentionally break another part without you realizing it.
<PHPLearner>	ljharb: why and how can they be bad
<mindstorm8191>	global variables are for when other solutions are impractical
<ljharb>	other solutions are never that impractical.
<PHPLearner>	ljharb: so how can I avoid using global variables then
<ljharb>	PHPLearner: use modules
<PHPLearner>	ljharb: what are modules
<alexcf2>	/w 20
<PHPLearner>	mindstorm8191: say I have an app
<PHPLearner>	like an app for kids to practice addition
<PHPLearner>	I need to keep tabs of correctAttempts and wrongAttempts
<ljharb>	PHPLearner: http://robotlolita.me/2013/06/06/node-modules-to-rule-them-all.html
<PHPLearner>	so I have those two variables
<mindstorm8191>	ljharb: oh I don't know about that.  Here's an example: I have keyboard controls set up to control a spaceship, in javascript.  There are other spaceships like it, so the player controls one of many ships.  But the problem is that javascript's onKeydown() function doesn't get called within the ship's class code, it gets called elsewhere - so I have no access to the player's ship from the onKeydown function
<ljharb>	mindstorm8191: sure, then you do need some kind of event bus
<ljharb>	and that might be quasi global, but it's not the same as having global shared state.
<ljharb>	and, that's only necessitated because of the DOM.
<ljharb>	actual javascript doesn't require it.
<GreenJello>	https://github.com/asyncly/EventEmitter2
<ljharb>	neither does node.
<Maxxi>	modules are pretty complicated imo, i never understood who exactly loads them in a webpage. Like if I define all my modules, I still have to add a script tag for every single .js file I have right?
<mindstorm8191>	ljharb: erm, that still sounds like using globals anyway
<ljharb>	Maxxi: that depends on what you're using
<Maxxi>	im using es6 modules with the export keyword
<ljharb>	mindstorm8191: it's technically the same but conceptually and semantically very different.
<PHPLearner>	ljharb: say I have an app like an app for kids to practice addition exercise and I need to keep tabs of correctAttempts and wrongAttempts so I have these two variables
<ljharb>	Maxxi: ok, so, it's way too soon to be using es6 modules. the loader spec isn't finished yet.
<ljharb>	PHPLearner: right, they still don't have to be global.
<Maxxi>	but it isnt different from all the other module libraries right? in essence I have to add all my .js files in a list in the correct order(!?) right?
<PHPLearner>	but how will I monitor them from inside a function
<Maxxi>	i still think thats hardly better than just not using any modules
<PHPLearner>	I mean I can I increment them based on say another function updateScores() which takes an argument which is the result of the checkAnswer() function
<PHPLearner>	HOw can I increment them
<mindstorm8191>	PHPLearner: if you ask me, the use of globals depends on how complex your app is.  if your example of a kids addition exercise, if that's all your program does, then sure, a global correctAttempts is perfectly fine
<ljharb>	Maxxi: not in any particular order.
<xecycle>	PHPLearner: you do not need to keep the two variables, what you need is to keep the two tabs.
<ljharb>	Maxxi: all the modules can be defined in any order. it's only the entry point that has to come last.
<mindstorm8191>	but if you plan on expanding on that later, you might want to wrap it into some kind of structure
<ljharb>	Maxxi: and it's much better to use modules because it encapsulates and separates your code
<Maxxi>	are you using commonjs or amd?
<ljharb>	amd is gross, i stick with commonJS via browserify.
<jaawerth>	I used to think the "one function per file" rule was excessive but (barring throw-away functions and such) I've since fallen in love with it
<ljharb>	<3
<ljharb>	consolidating is easy, separating is hard. so, start with everything separate.
<jaawerth>	it forces you to actually THINK about your application structure
<Maxxi>	but you export variables from inside that single function?
<PHPLearner>	and the checkAnswer function does not use an argument but makes use of the answer variable to check
<Torkable>	one function per file?
<jaawerth>	mapping it to a file structure (which is annoying) forcibly means you also have to think about how all the modules/functions will be required and used
<ljharb>	yes, one function per file/module
<ljharb>	Maxxi: i export *one value* from each module
<ljharb>	Maxxi: usually that value is a function.
<Torkable>	oh I see
<PHPLearner>	so how am I going to make these functions work if I do not declear answer, correctAttempts and wrongAttempts variables as global
<Maxxi>	ok so one object, which may contain a number of other objects
<tarkus>	Do you see any issues with loading initial set of data for dehydration on the client (SPA) in a form of JavaScript file, e.g. <scrpt src="dynamic-data.js">
<jaawerth>	I try to.. I still cheat here and there
<ljharb>	Maxxi: no
<ljharb>	Maxxi: i export one thing. objects containing other objects is just exporting a bag of many things.
<jaawerth>	*sometimes* that's appropriate on the top level of a directory (with, say, index.js) but typically it's a shortcut
<xecycle>	PHPLearner: from the user's point of view, when they answer a question, the program updates the UI.  They do not care how the program updated the UI internally.  Just go without "variable"s.
<PHPLearner>	xecycle: what tabs?
<jaawerth>	say you've got a bunch of methods for manipulating.. oh, a google maps API. you may do require('../maps/get-map.js') or require('../maps/plot-coordinates'), require('../maps/zoom') etc
<jaawerth>	each of thsoe being a function
<jaawerth>	juggling the dir structure can be a pain but it also makes you think reasonably about each of your functions, what they do, and how they should be grouped
<jaawerth>	in the same way that actually doing test driven development forces you to write code in a more modular fashion
<jaawerth>	there are growing pains but it saves more effort in the long run
<Maxxi>	u have lots of deeply nested directory structures then, otherwise i cant imagine
<jaawerth>	I try to make it as flat as possible
<jaawerth>	also the one-function-per-file thing mostly relates to higher order functions
<jaawerth>	little ones I group together more
<xecycle>	PHPLearner: you said "... I need to keep tabs of correctAttempts and wrongAttempts ..."
<jaawerth>	like, little utils and such
<Maxxi>	do you have a project on github where you tried this? would be interesting to see in a real project
<PHPLearner>	xecycle: so how will I show scores if I do not count the number of correctAttempts and the number of wrongAttempts
<jaawerth>	not reallly, unfortunately. most of the stuff I've been working on since I started really diving into this approach is NDA-ified because it relates to client data
<jaawerth>	I also haven't mastered it enough that it's super clean, sometimes things still get a bit jumbled - I've just gotten far enough that I've experienced the benefits ;-)
<javnut>	I want a regex pattern that'll basically match if "(<ul><span><b>x</b>.*</span><ul>)*" but not if it contains a "<span><b>y</b></span>"
<Havvy>	javnut:  RegExp isn't gonna help you there.
<ljharb>	!regex html @ javnut
<ecmabot>	javnut: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454
<xecycle>	PHPLearner: say, at some point, you're on a UI of 3 correct and 4 wrong.  Then the user submitted a correct answer.  You need to show a new UI of 4 correct and 4 wrong.  It is a transition from UI({ correct: 3, wrong: 4 }) to UI({ correct: 4, wrong: 4 }).  Going this way the program is a lot easier to reason about, than to "++correct; updateUICorrectCount();".
<Maxxi>	its a meme, u can write a regex if you really know ur target html.. but html is very loosely defined
<PHPLearner>	xecycle: I am still a newbie
<PHPLearner>	I am using mostly functions when programming in js
<PHPLearner>	what you are saying is use json is it?
<PHPLearner>	or maybe do an OOP in js
<xecycle>	PHPLearner: no.
<Havvy>	PHPLearner:  More 'structs' than 'objects' even though they're called objects.
<PHPLearner>	xecycle: I am only using jquery and jquery UI for this project
<xecycle>	UI({...}) is just a notion, for what you use to represent UI data structures.
<PHPLearner>	Havvy: can you please elaborate further
<PHPLearner>	xecycle: oh ok
<PHPLearner>	but sorry man I have spent 6 months using those variables
<Havvy>	Im too tired to elaborate further.
<javnut>	I found a workaround while pooping anyway
<xecycle>	PHPLearner: okay, you came to ask how to avoid global variables, because you feel them bad.  Go learn some FP --- functional programming, and use React; get rid of jquery.
<PHPLearner>	maybe once I meet my deadline on this project I will reconsider using OOP and some better data structures
<PHPLearner>	xecycle: no
<PHPLearner>	xecycle: I was just asking those questions to anticipate any future problems
<PHPLearner>	right now I am at the final stage of my project and need to implement the software
<PHPLearner>	to the client
<xecycle>	final stage of a project is to implement the software?  looks crazy to me.
<PHPLearner>	so maybe later I will do some restructuring of my program
<PHPLearner>	man I did 10 different apps
<PHPLearner>	client wanted me to implement them for use
<PHPLearner>	so I have to relent
<PHPLearner>	I was asking those questions I asked so that I can fix bugs better in the event they will happen
<xecycle>	I would say to implement the software is a step you must finish before you can tell the client when the software will be ready to use.
<PHPLearner>	secondly, I am thankful you all answered my questions now I learn something new and something worth considering when doing future projects
<PHPLearner>	xecycle: well I think they sort of want to do a testing
<PHPLearner>	so I think I should give it to them
<xecycle>	PHPLearner: something like, you have to finish a prototype before you claim to your client usability of the software.
<PHPLearner>	xecycle: yup
<PHPLearner>	something like that
<PHPLearner>	testing phase
<PHPLearner>	I recommended it since I do not want any blame and finger pointing later on
<PHPLearner>	at least I got to understand what they want and hopefully through testing they get to see what is created and how else to improve the software but based on certain agreed upon parameters set out at the beginning...
<PHPLearner>	xecycle: have you used AngularJS
<jaawerth>	ljharb: the other one I like is "You have a problem, so you use a RegExp. Now you have two problems!"
<xecycle>	PHPLearner: yes I did.  And I now switched to React.
<PHPLearner>	xecycle: I think you also used jQuery and jQueryUI before
<xecycle>	of course, years ago.
<PHPLearner>	xecycle: how do you find AngularJS
<PHPLearner>	xecycle: I am a freelance developer
<PHPLearner>	I just completed my course this month
<xecycle>	PHPLearner: I forgot how; I spent several weeks with it to get started, several months to do real development, and less than one week to switch to react.
<PHPLearner>	frontend jQuery and jQuerUI and backend PHP CodeIgniter
<PHPLearner>	xecycle: I am starting to learn it
<jaawerth>	xecycle: angular 2 angular 2 *fistpump*
<PHPLearner>	because over here most companies expects front end developer to use AngularJS
<xecycle>	jaawerth: no idea how well that does, but when I switched I heard nothing about angular 2.
<jaawerth>	yeah, it's still in beta and hasn't been out very long
<PHPLearner>	xecycle: so how do you find React
<jaawerth>	but it's exciting
<PHPLearner>	is it also an MVC kind of js
<xecycle>	PHPLearner: somewhere in a forum I usually read.
<jaawerth>	particularly if you like-a the bleeding edge
<jaawerth>	(ES6 and et al)
<PHPLearner>	jaawerth: do you like AngularJS
<jaawerth>	I do, but I also feel like Angular 1.x is showing its age
<jaawerth>	the learning curve is steep (much easier if you've got a strong grasp of JS fundamentals)
<jaawerth>	angular and react also serve slightly different purposes
<jaawerth>	react mostly cares about the view. angular does the view, but it's a framework for you to place code for tying a model to the view (via the view-model), and also has a bunch of built-in stuff for code organization - it's more all-in-one, whereas with react a lot of that other stuff you'd either code yourself or pick other modules for a la carte
<jaawerth>	heck, you can even use react and angular together
<xecycle>	React is not MVC; it is just the V part.  State-of-the-art V for js.
<Maxxi>	react is overcomplicated though
<Maxxi>	im glad there are alternatives
<PHPLearner>	jaawerth: I also started AngularJS
<PHPLearner>	and it is not easy
<javascript362>	hey guys
<javascript362>	;p;
<PHPLearner>	especially the part where you have to tie controller and views together
<fruitsNveggies>	does anyone know a linux media player that displays miliseconds?
<PHPLearner>	I always get confuse in the data binding part
<PHPLearner>	I do not get the things I expect to ge
<PHPLearner>	get
<xecycle>	Maxxi: alternatives to react?  interesting.  can you name a few competitive ones?
<fruitsNveggies>	xecycle, react or react native?
<prohobo>	react?
<xecycle>	fruitsNveggies: I have no devices to do react native, I mean react.
<fruitsNveggies>	idk. I use Meteor. I love it.
<jaawerth>	hmm I need to give someone Sorella's post about prototypical inheritance, what was the link..
<jaawerth>	!prototypes
<jaawerth>	!prototypical inheritance
<jaawerth>	bah, *googles*
<xecycle>	!class
<ecmabot>	xecycle: JavaScript does not have class-based inheritance (only a "class" keyword in ES6). Instead, it has constructor functions which initialize newly created objects that are linked to the constructor's prototype. These instances point to the prototype and use it for fallback property lookup. See also: !classes, !inheritance
<xecycle>	!inheritance
<ecmabot>	xecycle: JavaScript does not really have “inheritance” like classical languages. What it has is more properly called “property delegation” or “behavior delegation” http://davidwalsh.name/javascript-objects - ie `foo.bar(baz)` when `!foo.hasOwnProperty('bar')` is essentially doing `Object.getPrototypeOf(foo).bar.call(foo, baz)`
<jaawerth>	ahh

<jaawerth>	but not the one I'm thinking of

<ljharb>	hm
<ljharb>	!prototypes are not classes
<ecmabot>	ljharb: “Prototypes are not classes, and neither are constructor functions bundled with prototypes. They don’t encapsulate their private data, and they don’t have a metaclass object defining their behaviour. A prototype is to a class as a database record is to a model object.” — http://raganwald.com/2014/01/19/prototypes-are-not-classes.html

<jaawerth>	haha great, you ended up giving me another one I like to point people to as well
<ljharb>	:-)
<xecycle>	I usually find dumb objects easier to work with, than those have a bunch of methods on the prototype.
<jaawerth>	I provded those links and then recommended this person hang out in here, heh
<jaawerth>	I like prototypes just fine but hanging out in here has gotten me away from doing stateful OOP

<MasterKwoth>	is there a proper way to manage arrays of stuff in javascript?

<MasterKwoth>	i have several classes, and i instantiate a lot of objects and add them to their respective arrays, is there a proper way to delete those objects without leaking memory, because i would need to use splice and indexof array in order to delete something
<MasterKwoth>	is that expensive
<MasterKwoth>	i know what arrays are >.<
<Havvy>	You just drop all references to the values.
<Havvy>	Just like any other language with Garbage Collection.
<MasterKwoth>	well yeah
<MasterKwoth>	that means if i drop 10 objects per frame i would do array.splice(array.indexOf(myObj),1) 10 times per frame?
<Havvy>	No. Just you drop the reference to the array.
<TyrfingMjolnir>	This t he way to go? if( typeof something === "undefined" ) { alert("something is undefined"); }
<MasterKwoth>	just drop the reference to the array?
<Havvy>	Yep.
<MasterKwoth>	array has 1000+ objects?
<MasterKwoth>	i want to delete 10
<Havvy>	Oh, then yeah...splice them out or set them to undefined or something.
<Havvy>	Or if they all have a specific quality, you can generate a new array using the filter method.
<MasterKwoth>	well im wondering whats the cost of doing that
<MasterKwoth>	nah they dont
<ljharb>	1000 is nothing. use filter.
<Havvy>	The cost is probably the same as doing the same with a Java ArrayList or C++ Vec.
<Havvy>	Though I'm wondering how you determine which 10 elements to remove.
<MasterKwoth>	check if they are eaten
<Havvy>	So how do you know if it is eaten?
<MasterKwoth>	i have food, and players, if player moves over the food, he eats it
<Havvy>	So...  foods = foods.filter(isPlayerOver)
<TyrfingMjolnir>	How can I write the opposite of if( typeof something === "undefined" )
<TyrfingMjolnir>	?
<MasterKwoth>	distance between the centers minus the radius
<Havvy>	TyrfingMjolnir:  Change the `===` to `!==`?

<MasterKwoth>	if i have setInterval within an object, will setinterval die if i remove the references to that object?
<ljharb>	MasterKwoth: what do you mean within an object
<ljharb>	and no
<GreenJello>	MasterKwoth, nope
<ljharb>	!setinterval @ MasterKwoth
<ecmabot>	MasterKwoth: Avoid setInterval; use setTimeout instead. http://zetafleet.com/blog/why-i-consider-setinterval-harmful
<GreenJello>	setInterval is self contained, it isn't owned by anything
<GreenJello>	clearInterval and closing the browser tab are the only ways to make it stop
<MasterKwoth>	thanks, so if i remove object that has settimeout in function, basicaly it wont run after object loses its references?
<abgfkd>	this when I print to monitor the value disappears immediately why? how do I fix ? https://bpaste.net/show/fdeed76e6dc8
<falafel>	abgfkd, need to prevent the default behavior
<falafel>	abgfkd, also, avoid document.write
<ljharb>	MasterKwoth: no, setTimeout is the same.
<falafel>	abgfkd, also, avoid inline events, and the event can be adde dto the form, no need for the click event
<ljharb>	MasterKwoth: if there's a timer set, that's a reference.
<MasterKwoth>	ljharb, how do i kill it then
<ljharb>	MasterKwoth: clearTimeout/clearInterval
<ljharb>	and setTimeout/setInterval return an integer (a timeout) that must be passed to the clear methods.

<ecmabot>	MasterKwoth: WindowTimers.setTimeout() - Web API Interfaces | MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setTimeout>
<MasterKwoth>	so i would need to add onDeath() function to my object and call it when i delete taht object to clear interval
<ljharb>	what are you trying to achieve?
<ljharb>	it sounds like you're doing something really odd.
<MasterKwoth>	i have an array of objects lets say they are called spawners. Spawners spawn other objects every couple of seconds. If i remove a spawner, i want to remove it completely, but you just say reference stays as long as there is setInterval/settimeout
<MasterKwoth>	so when i remove a spawner, i would need to remove its internal settimeout
<ljharb>	why would you need setinterval for that tho
<ljharb>	just count seconds, and you know how many objects you would have spawned.
<abgfkd>	falafel, and then you can come Solve ?
<MasterKwoth>	ljharb: i dont understand
<ljharb>	MasterKwoth: the objects don't actually have to exist.
<MasterKwoth>	they do, because they are drawn of the screen, they have their position, and movement vector etc
<MasterKwoth>	and they spawn other stuff every x seconds
<ljharb>	it seems like you can just use math to, at any moment, draw what the screen looks like
<ljharb>	and you wouldn't want to waste resources drawing things that are off-screen.
<h3yTh3re>	hello there boys and gals, I got a tricky one, I have some json returning on an ajax success function and in there am checking if one of my objects is null(which is for half of my cases) problem is when that is null it returns Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of null, the way am checking if its null is by if(array !== null){} i've tried
<h3yTh3re>	 many other several ways which do not solve the problem any ideas?
<ljharb>	it could also be undefined.
<ljharb>	but also, post a jsfiddle.
<h3yTh3re>	it is null cause i do console.log(value) and I get it as null
<h3yTh3re>	am not pretty sure how to replicate that on jsfiddle tbh
<willv2>	h3yTh3re: Post more code at least
<willv2>	i.e. the success callback + an example JSON

<abishek>	how can I do a parallel ajax execution and accumulate all the results into a single variable and use it?
<GreenJello>	abishek, yep, that's easiest to accomplish with promises
<GreenJello>	you create an array of promises, and then do Promise.all(promises).then(function(results){ ... })
<GreenJello>	results[0] is what promises[0] resolves to, etc.

<episage>	How to debug JS async code? I have the following: https://gist.github.com/episage/60c7cb388736006a3205
<episage>	No idea where a variable gets filtered out to 0 length

<fcanela>	Hello. I have a function that calls a asyncronous method
*	Narig0 is now known as Narigo
<fcanela>	I want to make the function return when the method gives one specific value, but I am unable to find a way to make it because javascript async nature
<fcanela>	if I place a "var success" which I change inside the async method and after the async I check success to return or not, it gets checked before async call ends
<fcanela>	If I use promises, promises are a function and the returns applies to the promise, not the caller method
<fcanela>	tl;dr: How to make another function return? Can I do any trick with apply and self or something like that?
<MichD>	fcanela I'm afraid the only real option is to rethink the structure to allow for the async-ness of the functionality
<fcanela>	It seems like I lack serious async handling resources. I am not going to bother you digging more about this problem.
<fcanela>	Any resource (book, for example) I can study to improve my js async handling?
<MichD>	I don't know of any specific resources on organising code for async stuff
<MichD>	I haven't read this entire article, but it might be helpful; on callback functions: http://recurial.com/programming/understanding-callback-functions-in-javascript/

<jaawerth>	Golynx: well I have no idea what db module you're using there but pretty much every DB driver I know if is asynchronous, and if it's the kind of asynchronous API that takesa callback rather than returning a promise then, yeah, it'd return undefined
<jaawerth>	Golynx: You (probably) need to pass in a callback that accepts the data as an argument
<Golynx>	jaawerth: how do you do that ?
*	zz_robotmayo is now known as robotmayo

<jaawerth>	well, first I was going to try to get 'em to tell me what db driver that is
<jaawerth>	'cause it's probably more function(err, res) { } (most of them are), but who knows?
<asteele>	yea lol
<asteele>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<jaawerth>	I'm working with an API module right now (the only one out there in existence for that API.. at least on NPM) and it returns an object with three callbacks as its properties: .ok, .notOk, and .error

<Golynx>	jaawerth: should i do "return otherFunction(outputDBData);" and then return the data from otherFunction() ?
*	oddskill is now known as oddskill_away
<jaawerth>	Golynx: well, it's probably db.some.call(param, otherparam, function(err, result) { if (err) throw err; // do stuff with result }) but I'll need you to tell me what db module you're using to know for sure ;-)
<sonthonax>	Has anyone found jest-cli mocking to be really buggy?
<asteele>	lol to be fair he probably just didnt know about promises yet.  not saying thats good or ok but :P  I know sometimes i find something that works and just use it so i can actually make progress even if its not the best solution lol
<sonthonax>	jest.DontMock()
<sonthonax>	feels like shooting in the dark.
<jaawerth>	Golynx: the typical pattern is that the callback is always the last argument - it MIGHT not be of the form function(err, res) { } but that's a pretty standard convention popularized by node
<jaawerth>	asteele: I'd like to think so, but.. see.. the other bizarre thing about it is he spun it out of an angular-related thing. And it's now a module that tried to detect whether it's in an angular or node context and act accordingly
<Golynx>	jaawerth: i just made the "DB" for sqlite connection so i can better work with it in the app.

<jaawerth>	Golynx: alright, sqlite. what's our platform here? browser? node? native app?
<jaawerth>	and what are you using to actually connect to sqlite?
<stephen>	Batteries
<jaawerth>	the npm sqlite module?
<Golynx>	jaawerth: browser
<Golynx>	jaawerth: no , just browser native WEB SQL
<Pallet>	cofo, you still there dude?
<cofo>	Why?
<Pallet>	https://www.dropbox.com/s/5nn7nle9iqmej8u/DevTools2.png?dl=0 just wanted to show you that
<jaawerth>	ahh okay
<Golynx>	jaawerth: the only callbacks are "tx.executeSql("SELECT jtoken FROM settings WHERE ID = 1", [], SUCCESSCALLBACK(), FAILCALLBACK());
<cofo>	Hmm?
<jaawerth>	Golynx: so uh, as I recall (never used it much), websql calls typically have a callback of the form function(tx, results) { }
<Pallet>	see what I mean
<sonthonax>	Does jest-cli work with es6 modules?
<Pallet>	I know it's not actually a JS issue
<jaawerth>	right, SUCCESSCALLBACK, FAILCALLBACK
<jaawerth>	those are the functions you need to pass in (you wouldn't execute them with (), the call will do that upon success and/or fail)
<cofo>	not really Palle
<cofo>	t
<Pallet>	ok
<Pallet>	not to worry ;)
<cofo>	:(
<Golynx>	jaawerth: but i already use "function(tx, results) { ... }" in the SUCCESSCALLBACK . How do i return the data from the SUCCESSCALLBACK ?
<jaawerth>	you don't
<GreenJello_>	Pallet, your server sends the wrong content-type header
<jaawerth>	once you're in callback land, you're in callbackland
<jaawerth>	you can call another function from there to get things done, or to store the data somewhere
<GreenJello_>	Pallet, you need to make it send text/javascript if it's serving js
<jaawerth>	you could wrap the whole thing in a Promise so you can at least then chain promises and the like (I prefer this to callbacks)
<jaawerth>	but one thing you can't do is treat it as if it's synchronous (at least, not until ES7 is released - hopefully we all won't be retired by then ;-) )
<jaawerth>	(well okay, there IS a trick for faking async/await in ES6 but I digress)
<jaawerth>	Golynx: also, I should note that websql is deprecated now in favor of IndexDB. If you want to learn browser database stuff I would use that instead - you'll likely find better documentation for it too
<jaawerth>	Golynx: in the meantime, we need to find you some good material on handling async in js..
<jaawerth>	!async
<ecmabot>	jaawerth: JavaScript doesn't have a concept of "sleep" or "wait". This functionality may be provided by the environment, such as browser JS's setTimeout. E.g., http://jsfiddle.net/8Y5qe/. jQuery and many other libraries support promises, e.g. http://jsfiddle.net/4n9Gu/.  Also take a look at https://github.com/caolan/async https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird https://github.com/kriskowal/q when you have a lot of callbacks.

<GreenJello_>	Pallet, you need to do it in php
<Pallet>	really?
<Pallet>	ah ok
<jaawerth>	Golynx: my favorite client-side storage option is pouchdb. It's super mega awesome, because you can use the same API on both client and server if you want, and it can also act as a client to a CouchDB server, and do cool things like auto synchronization and change listening
<sonthonax>	Hey has anyone here ever used jest-cli?
<jaawerth>	(for what it's worth)
<jaawerth>	Golynx: it's all JS-based, you can use a multitude of possible storage adapters for it, so it'll work with.. almost any sort of client. Mobile, web, chrome app, server.. heck someone's probably got it running in a microwave
<sonthonax>	In jest-cli I seem to be unable not to mock modules.
<jaawerth>	"unable to not mock"?
<sonthonax>	jaawerth: jest.dontMock()
<Golynx>	jaawerth: i got php at the backend. Rather want to keep it simple for now. Not too much libraries
<sonthonax>	Isn’t working properly (or at least I thnk it’s not)
<jaawerth>	ohh right because jest mocks by default
<jaawerth>	Golynx: hey, up to you
<jaawerth>	but you'rue missing out ;-)
<sonthonax>	jaawerth: I’m trying to test a module, which depends on another module, so in my Test, I set that module not to be mocked.
<sonthonax>	However it is being mocked.
<Golynx>	jaawerth: my solution will be. To move the function the DB call was supposed to be used on, to the SUCCESSCALLBACK. Thanks
<jaawerth>	and you're doing so before requiring it, right?
<sonthonax>	jaawerth: I have a small stack overflow question http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30236900/jest-dontmock-doesnt-seem-to-work
<sonthonax>	jaawerth: yes I’m doing it before requiring.
<jaawerth>	sonthonax: hmm but I see you're using ES6 modules
<jaawerth>	sonthonax: I don't use jest, but does it say it will also work with ES6 modules in the docs? Because those work differently with how they're loaded
<sonthonax>	jaawerth: I thought that would be the problem.
<sonthonax>	But it’s not actually.
<sonthonax>	Even if I get rid of the es6 modules same problem.
<jaawerth>	sonthonax: have you previously required those modules in other tests (wherein you weren't using dontMock)?
<sonthonax>	I have one other test, but it’s just an empty file.
<jaawerth>	sonthonax: what are you using for a transpiler?
<sonthonax>	babel-node
<sonthonax>	I’ve actually just removed all the es6 module stuff, and I’ve removed the other empty file.
<sonthonax>	So this is the only test now, and it uses traditional node style exports and imports now.
<sonthonax>	And no avial.
<jaawerth>	sonthonax: http://babeljs.io/docs/using-babel/#jest
<jaawerth>	babel COULD still be interfering
<jaawerth>	I'd use that instead of babel-node for the tests and see if it still makes a difference

<sonthonax>	I can’t seen to find a guide to get it to work.
<lenswipe>	ashnur, I want to have similar functionality to OOP (although i am aware that js doesn't support OOP)
<ashnur>	TyrfingMjolnir: 'returns'?
<TyrfingMjolnir>	Ideall when I run a script on the command line it should return when it's done
<Sorella>	lenswipe: JS supports OOP, just a different kind of it

<Sorella>	!oop @ lenswipe

<lenswipe>	Sorella, well it supports closures so yeah i guess
<ashnur>	right, that would've been the second one, thx Sorella
<Sorella>	"Better" is arguable here.
<TyrfingMjolnir>	crunchyturtle: Where on nodeschool.io ?

<lenswipe>	anyhooo....what is the most elegant way to clean up that code?
<ashnur>	Sorella: come join me with writing ExtJS 4 components and then lets discuss which is better
<Sorella>	lenswipe: JS has a model of OO where you've only got objects, and objects inherit directly from existing objects.
<Sorella>	lenswipe: if you want elegant and clean code, going functional is a better idea :D
<Sorella>	ashnur: I wouldn't call ExtJS "OOP" :P

<lenswipe>	I'm trying to encapsulate that code and I can't decide if I should use closures or if I should just use a js object...the issue with using a js object is that I'm not sure if I can use this inside it (can I?)
<ashnur>	Sorella: that's just a No True Scottsman argument. No one cares (well almost no one) what you call OOP :). If those who use it say it's OOP, then it's OOP

<sonthonax>	And I don’t want it to be mocked.
<lenswipe>	personally I love underscore...but hey ho
<sonthonax>	I’d like the data to be real.
<lalaland1125>	fabio_, So you have an array like [1,2,3] and [6,7], and you want [1,2,3,6,7]?
<fabio_>	lalaland1125, exactly.  right now ive got [1,2,3,[6,7]]
<lalaland1125>	fabio_, If so, use concat (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat)
<fabio_>	lalaland1125, this is to add to a existing angular array of objects
<yansanmo>	>> var a = [1,2,3] a.push.apply(a, [6,7]); a
<ecmabot>	yansanmo: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
<yansanmo>	>> var a = [1,2,3]; a.push.apply(a, [6,7]); a
<ecmabot>	yansanmo: (object) [1, 2, 3, 6, 7]
<Sorella>	lenswipe: seems like your company has poor policies =/
<lenswipe>	Sorella, politics, not policies
<lalaland1125>	fabio_, Oh, you need mutation. You can use apply with push in order to do the pushing in place.
<lenswipe>	Sorella, how's this? https://gist.github.com/711bf30739998adef4b2
<Sorella>	Or that
<lalaland1125>	var a = [1,2]; Array.prototype.push.apply([4,6]); // a is now [1,2,4,6]
<lalaland1125>	Oops
<lalaland1125>	var a = [1,2]; Array.prototype.push.apply(a,[4,6]); // a is now [1,2,4,6]
<Sorella>	lenswipe: just use `var alert = { bar: function(message, type) { ... }, success: function(message){ return this.bar(message, 'success') }, failure: function(message){ return this.bar(message, 'failure') }}` instead
<fabio_>	lalaland1125, im woried if in that way the angular will be able to watch for changes
<Sorella>	lenswipe: using functions to mutate objects you don't know is not that nice :)
<lalaland1125>	fabio_, Angular should be able to catch it when you reassign the array.
<lenswipe>	to mutate objects?
<lalaland1125>	Mutation should be unnecessary. (Although I don't really use angular, so I can't say for sure)
<lenswipe>	what do you mean?
<lalaland1125>	Concat should fit your needs fine.
<fabio_>	let's see
<Sorella>	lenswipe: `this.foo = bar` is mutating an arbitrary object referred by the `this` argument passed to that function
<lenswipe>	oh
<Sorella>	If you use object literals, you always know what's going to happen.
<beaky>	hello
<foofin>	Hello!
<Sorella>	!this @ lenswipe
<ecmabot>	lenswipe: If a function call is of the form `a.b()`, `this` will be the object you accessed the "b" property from. Otherwise, if it's of the form `a()`, `this` will be `undefined`, which is turned into the global object if the function isn't in strict mode. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/08/30/understanding-javascripts-this/
*	Sorella would recommend reading the article she has linked before tho
<beaky>	are there alternatives to lodash as a small lib for common list processing stuff
<beaky>	btw how do u guys keep track of all the js libs out there (there are too many for me :D)
<lalaland1125>	Some of the stuff in lodash is now in the standard library.
<beaky>	wow it is?
<lenswipe>	Sorella, thanks, that's sort of what I was after
<lalaland1125>	Check out mdn. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array
<lalaland1125>	Still need lodash for most fancy things though.
<beaky>	seems to be only the basic stuff like map/reduce/filter
<beaky>	(but those get u rly far :D) i dont like reinventing my own such functions like flatMap et al
<beaky>	so maybe a lib would be beter
<lalaland1125>	Immutable-js (http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js) is one good collection library (but only for immutable work)
<javascript963>	i want to be able to "pause" my javascript program, stop all timers etc. I can only think of ugly ways of doing this. Any suggestions?
<bradleymeck>	javascript963: 1. what JS environment are we talking about 2. JS will completely stop / you won't get events if you do this
<Sorella>	javascript963: while(true); will pause your program :3
<Sorella>	Though yeah, not sure what you mean by "pause" here. It'd better if you described what you want to do instead
<sash87>	hi all
<sash87>	nickserv identify sash87 sasmit87
<bradleymeck>	Sorella: https://www.touchdevelop.com/ , idk if you saw it, but you are interested in these things
<javascript963>	bradleymeck: No particular environment. It's basicly a simulator i want to make many instance of, f.ex  pause 1 simulation and start a different one. While the first one remains its state and time
<javascript963>	Sorella: :>
<bradleymeck>	javascript963: can't
<bradleymeck>	javascript963: you can look at generators on how to do something, but there is not a generic way to do this
<bradleymeck>	and you can't pause at random points
<Sorella>	bradleymeck: ah, I've got that on my phone, but haven't tried it yet
<jecran_>	Hi js land. I was wondering, in regular js or using node, is it possible to get the currently active/focused window from SERVER side? I want my web page to display the currently active application, ie firefox or a command line. Any ideas? I can get a list of current processes, but not which one is being used/focused
<javascript963>	I see :( thanks for help
<bradleymeck>	jecran_: not unless you have a node program running on the client
<sash87>	hi .. anybody able to see my message
<sash87>	please reply
<bradleymeck>	sup
<rossimo>	sash87: i think you dumped your password into chat
<sonthonax>	Hey if anyone has any expirance with jest and ajax.
<sonthonax>	Their expertise and expirance would be really apreciated
<sonthonax>	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30239827/how-do-use-superagent-when-testing-in-jest-cli
<sash87>	yeah by mistake
<sash87>	how do I change it
<jecran_>	bradleymeck: the client is just the created .html page sent from node. I am looking to get this info right on the server and create the page with it.
<bradleymeck>	jecran_: https://www.npmjs.com/package/detect-active-title looks like it does what you want, but you can't run that straight from the browser / idk if it works on all OS
<jecran_>	cool ill check it out
<rossimo>	sash87: you'll have to look up the nickserv docs on the freenode site
<sash87>	ok
<sash87>	now lets comeback to js
<sonthonax>	This ajax/jest/jasime combo is really depressing, because there are a number of other unanswered questions about it on stackoverflow.
<sash87>	service._data.shortName = response.services[i].editorial.shortName;
<jecran_>	bradleymeck: ok cool, but I am interested on learning how to obtain that process and can't find any resources to do so. Any recommendations?
<bradleymeck>	jecran_: it varies per OS
<sash87>	I have some value for the right side statement .. but after this line get executed and I print the left side value
<sash87>	it gives me undefined
<sash87>	is not it strange??
<cjohnson>	javascript963: develop your application to be easily paused/resumed
<cjohnson>	don't rely on external things like timers
<cjohnson>	etc
<sonthonax>	I will pay someone in btc to answer my stack overflow question.
<cjohnson>	put all your work into a queue and process the queue to make it move forward
<cjohnson>	that way you can just stop walking the queue to "pause"
<Tony-X>	lista
<bradleymeck>	jecran_: basic workflow is to find the currently active window/dialog and then find the attached pid, it is a complete pain, idk of a library that will just do that for you
<sonthonax>	Should I just give up trying to get superagent to work with jest?
<sonthonax>	Am I missunderstanding what jest is for?
<sonthonax>	Should I try a different approach?
<sonthonax>	Are there any testing frameworks with don’t make it difficult to use requests?
<pynthon>	Hello, I am a JS newb so please forgive my ignorance :(. But would it be possible to filter an array of objects based on the propties of the objects?
<sash87>	can anybody help me
<sonthonax>	pynthon: yes.
<cool_boy>	Hi, So I am needing a fancy confirm dialogue box , I am trying with smoke.js , it opens and works well but it changes scope of this, then my functions doesn't get execute and I get error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'get' of undefined"
<cool_boy>	how do I keep this unchanged?
<sonthonax>	pynthon Iterate though the object and test yfor a condition on each property.
<cool_boy>	"this"
*	cjohnson divines cool_boy's code
<cjohnson>	ah, the answer is line 42
<pynthon>	sonthonax: Ah, thats the linear way. Would it also be possible to do it via filter?
<pynthon>	sonthonax: More functional programming like :p
<cjohnson>	!mdn Array#filter @ pynthon
<ecmabot>	pynthon: Array.prototype.filter() - JavaScript | MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter>
<sonthonax>	pynthon: no, you can only filters on arrays.
<javascript963>	cjohnson: yeah , was thinking somewhere along these lines . Thanks! :)
<cool_boy>	cjohnson: what is that :)
<sonthonax>	So anyone here used jest-cli?
<cjohnson>	cool_boy: it's a joke. I'm saying you didn't past any code but you expect us to answer questions about it :P
<sonthonax>	And trierd to get ajax requests to work in it with superagent?
<cjohnson>	in general though, look at .bind or .apply/.call cool_boy
<cool_boy>	cjohnson: I thought it would be general issue, I will paste code, thanks  :)
<pynthon>	sonthonax: Ah I see. Thank you very much for the quick reply!
<cjohnson>	>> function foo() { console.log(this.name); }; foo.call({name: 'cjohnson'}) @ cool_boy
<ecmabot>	cool_boy: undefined; Console: 'cjohnson'
<cjohnson>	>> function foo() { console.log(this.name); }; var cjohnsonFoo = foo.bind({name: 'cjohnson'}); cjohnsonFoo(); @ cool_boy
<ecmabot>	cool_boy: undefined; Console: 'cjohnson'
<cjohnson>	etc
<cjohnson>	pynthon: you want Array#filter right?
<TomMMM>	Got a little bit of a confusing issue, I have made a file uploader, looks all pretty and ajax drag and drop functionality etc however I am tasked with creating placeholder element for each uploaded file whilst it uploads. How can I identify what element belongs to what image when uploading multiple files in one go. (Essentially this placeholder gets created for each image thats being uploaded, id like to change the placeholder to the actual image aft
<TomMMM>	er its done)
<cjohnson>	you want to reduce your array of objects to only objects which match certain conditions
<cjohnson>	TomMMM: set a data attribute on the placeholder and when the file is done uploading, look for the corresponding image with that file's data attribute and hide it
<cjohnson>	or just store the reference to the image in a variable that lasts as long as the file upload process
<jecran_>	bradleymeck: Ok, I checked out the source code to that link. Its all external applications returning his information, and there is no guarantee it is the active window. Scripting time lol
<TomMMM>	But the issue is cjohnson is if I set a data attribute, theres nothing to reference it from on the server side, like how is the server going to tell the javascript okay this image belongs to this
<cjohnson>	server side? where does that come into play
<cjohnson>	keep track of it on the client side
<Encapsulation>	lenswipe, indeed
<lenswipe>	Encapsulation, well hello
<TomMMM>	its probably not really an issue with javascript at all, its just on the upload completion, the server sends back down "Okay this image has been uploaded and heres all its thumbnails"
<lenswipe>	do you come here often? ;)
<rossimo>	>> function foo() { var i=0; while (true) i++ };
<ecmabot>	rossimo: undefined
<TomMMM>	Its just I cant seem to think of a way of matching those thumbnails with the placeholder image
<cjohnson>	TomMMM: the code the triggered the upload should be able to keep track of which upload completion corresopnds to which file you sent
<Encapsulation>	=D
<cjohnson>	and thus, which data attribute to use
<TomMMM>	It can, but when its multiple files in one request you only receive one completion notification for every file uploaded
<pynthon>	cjohnson: Thanks for the reply. Well lets say I have an array of objects = cars = [car1, car2, car3, car4]. Every car has a property called color ie. color: red, color:black Now I want to do cars.filter(color="red")
<cool_boy>	so here is code https://gist.github.com/anonymous/67e3df2cfae4758db433 , I am calling smoke.confirm() at line 9  , please ignore line 12 "this.self;" and code stops working at line 14 with error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'get' of undefined"
<cjohnson>	TomMMM: and?
<pynthon>	cjohnson: And that must return all the cars with color red
<cjohnson>	you keep track of an array of the original filenames, when it says "okay, got em all", you update each of the placeholders with the filenames
<sonthonax>	Has anyone here ever ever ever used jasmine?
<cjohnson>	pynthon: cool, read the docs I linked you to
<cjohnson>	Array#filter will do that easily
<TomMMM>	Hrm, I suppose, just be dependant on whether or not the same file name is used?
<cjohnson>	yeah, unless you're renaming files in the backend
<cjohnson>	in which case you need your backend to return am apping of old files -> new files
<TomMMM>	I am but im sending the original name too which should be fine
<TomMMM>	Fair enough then, thanks! Will give it a go
<cjohnson>	so you send ['filea.jpg', 'fileb.jpg'] and it returns {'filea.jpg': 'filea-renamed.jpg', 'fileb.jpg': 'fileb-renamed.jpg'} then when you get the response, for each of the files you sent, look up their new name in the server response
<cjohnson>	replace placeholder with the new name
<cjohnson>	etc
<pynthon>	cjohnson: Thank you very much! I didnt saw your link. You mean this one? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter
<cjohnson>	pynthon: yep
<pynthon>	cjohnson: Ah I see. Thank you very much
<cjohnson>	no prob
<TomMMM>	Oh I meant as in, if someone uploads 2 files with the same name
<cjohnson>	well then you'd have to send some extra unique token with each file
<cjohnson>	and do that for the mapping keys
<cjohnson>	{'uniq1': 'filea-renamed.jpg'}
<cjohnson>	etc
<m_e>	can you do something like this: while ((var result = content.match(/\{\{efn/g)) != null) { // do something with result }
<TomMMM>	Ah oki, suppose I could do the order of the files + some upload number
<cjohnson>	what happens when you try it m_e
<m_e>	doesnt work.
<cjohnson>	!doesn't work
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: What do you mean it doesn't work? Is it unemployed? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? What did you want or expect to happen?
<cool_boy>	cjohnson: so here is code https://gist.github.com/anonymous/67e3df2cfae4758db433 , I am calling smoke.confirm() at line 9  , please ignore line 12 "this.self;" and code stops working at line 14 with error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'get' of undefined"
<cjohnson>	10:35 < cjohnson> in general though, look at .bind or .apply/.call cool_boy
<cjohnson>	>> function foo() { console.log(this.name); }; foo.call({name: 'cjohnson'}) @ cool_boy
<ecmabot>	cool_boy: undefined; Console: 'cjohnson'
<cjohnson>	>> function foo() { console.log(this.name); }; var cjohnsonFoo = foo.bind({name: 'cjohnson'}); cjohnsonFoo(); @ cool_boy
<ecmabot>	cool_boy: undefined; Console: 'cjohnson'
<cool_boy>	cjohnson: thanks will try
<cjohnson>	so you either need to smoke.confirm.call(this, 'text', function(...
<cjohnson>	or you can just replace this.pos with self.pos inside your function body
<cjohnson>	since you already stored the outer "this" as self
<cjohnson>	line 4
<cjohnson>	oh woops actually I lied
<cjohnson>	it would be smoke.confirm('text', (function(confirmed){ ... body here ... }).bind(this));
<cjohnson>	since it's the callback that you want to bind
<m_e>	what i want is to evaluate a return value of a function inside the while(...) and at the same time assign the result to a variable. i have no idea what the syntax would be if this is even possible
<cjohnson>	m_e: what doesn't work about it
<cjohnson>	do you get an error? what result do you get
<m_e>	 while ((var result = content.match(/\{\{efn/g)) != null) -> result: SyntaxError: Unexpected token var
<m_e>	so the syntax must be wrong
<m_e>	cjohnson: alright looks like you cant declare a variable inside the condition. but you can assign it
<cjohnson>	declare it above
<cjohnson>	yep
<cjohnson>	otherwise what you got looks fine
<m_e>	this works: while ((result = content.match(/\{\{efn/g)) != null)

<Berra>	Browsers like Chrome and Firefox has a get unique selector function, can this easily be implemented in only Javascript or is roundabout?
<cjohnson>	_X_C_V_B_: you mean the background to the select element? I'm not sure you can change that
<zeroquake>	is x.prototype = new y() and x.prototype.constructor = y the same thing?
<cjohnson>	that's browser-managed
<_X_C_V_B_>	cjohnson: yes, I think
<bradleymeck>	zeroquake: no
<zeroquake>	how are they different ? x.prototype = new y(), you are creating an constructor of y into x prototype right?
<cjohnson>	the latter doesn't initialize anything
<jaawerth>	zeroquake: well first of all, if you're talking about doing inheritance you'd actually want to do X.prototype = Object.create(Y.prototype)
<jaawerth>	x.prototype = new y() is going to instantiate a y object and then put it on the X prototype
<Sorella>	zeroquake: .prototype and .constructor are just regular properties of an object, they can be anything.
<javascript963>	they are just a namespace basicly?
<Sorella>	zeroquake: you can also do `a.constructor = null`, for example, or `a.constructor = b`. They don't have any special meaning in the language
<zeroquake>	yes , so what is use of setting a constructor ? i thought when you inherit from say "y" in this case , function y(){} becomes the constructor of x no ?
<jaawerth>	except they'll change how you interact with instanceof, .isPrototypeOf, and Object.getPrototypeOf
<austeritysucks>	when i have an object how do i know what i can get out of it
<jaawerth>	zeroquake: instanceof walks the prototype chain checking each foo.prototype.constructor for a match
<jaawerth>	(which is one of the reasons it's not great to use instanceof, since not everyone sets the constructor)
<zeroquake>	interesting , will research more into this topic. thank you.
<cjohnson>	austeritysucks: inspect it with your debugger
<cjohnson>	or read the docs of whatever code generated it
<zeroquake>	use console
<zeroquake>	easiest to see what methods are in there.

<austeritysucks>	cjohnson, yea but hwen i do like Json("symbol") it returns nothing
<cjohnson>	uh?
<austeritysucks>	(to follow the example)
<cjohnson>	you have an array of objects
<cjohnson>	try maybe
<cjohnson>	Json(0)('symbol') ?
<austeritysucks>	cjohnson, ive tried variations of that and get "out of range" errors
<inimino>	VBA? why?
<cjohnson>	I dunno why you'd need this thing anyway
<cjohnson>	just JSON.parse() it and then you can do
<cjohnson>	data.forEach(function(item) { console.log(item.symbol); });
<cjohnson>	that will print each symbol property for each object in the array
<austeritysucks>	i had problems with type mismatch for JSON.parse
<austeritysucks>	that's why i used this
<austeritysucks>	and inimino i know :(
<jaawerth>	that would typically mean the JSON is invalid
<cjohnson>	if you got errors from JSON.parse, your input was bad
<jaawerth>	unless it's using JSON5 or some crazy thing
<austeritysucks>	cjohnson, the input was this json string i provided
<austeritysucks>	is this the problem?
<jaawerth>	(they should have called JSON5 'J5ON')

<austeritysucks>	is this bad format ?
<cjohnson>	parses fine for me
<cjohnson>	I get no type mismatch
<cjohnson>	My guess is your type mismatch came *afteR* the JSON.parse
<cjohnson>	when you were iterating the data
<jaawerth>	hmm probably
<jaawerth>	I parsed it fine too
<austeritysucks>	my only code is setting the json string to what you saw, and then doing JSON.parse(jsonText)
*	Torkable is now known as Guest26906
<austeritysucks>	er, Set jsonObj = JSON.parse(jsonText)
<austeritysucks>	to be precise
<austeritysucks>	and this said type mismatch
<austeritysucks>	i figured itw as something with 64bit or i dont evek now
<jaawerth>	worked for me
<jaawerth>	doing mostly the same thing
<cjohnson>	nope, works fine here
<cjohnson>	if you're getting that error, your jsonText isn't the same as the text you just sent us
<jaawerth>	austeritysucks: are you actually using it inline? or are you grabbing it from a file/http request or something?
<cjohnson>	maybe you're parsing it twice
*	lanceball is now known as lance|afk
<austeritysucks>	jaawerth, grabbing from URL but the string looks fine
<jaawerth>	are you *sure* it's a string?
<jaawerth>	and not already parsed?
<jaawerth>	I feel like it's either gonna be that or a stray character or something coming from the request
<jaawerth>	some APIs will including an invalid character offset for security reasons (and the client code will strip those chars)
<austeritysucks>	ill post the code
<austeritysucks>	but yea im pretty sure
<poosanth>	anyone use he q promise library here?
<austeritysucks>	http://pastebin.com/HsAzSu0Q
<poosanth>	*the
<austeritysucks>	sorry its a little ugly, but you see i dim jsontext as string, and the string is just copied output of that url which is in JSON format, and then i am setting object as the output of JSON.parse()
<jaawerth>	oh I think I was confused
<jaawerth>	haha
<austeritysucks>	yea i am doing two different ways side by side so im commenting a lot
<austeritysucks>	its ugly
<jaawerth>	I saw you mentioend VBA but for some reason I thought we were talking javascript
<Felishia>	how do I check the result of an input before it is updated?
<Felishia>	I was tempted to do
<zeroquake>	<jaawerth> : what do i google to read about setting constructor property and weird behaviour of instanceOf?
<poosanth>	I've included the q promise library with a script tag, but noticing in the console it's complaining about not having 'require', I thought I could use it as a global? :S any ideas
<Felishia>	to catch the event key and add that to the current input value
<Felishia>	bUT!
*	athan_ is now known as athan
<Felishia>	I don't know where I'm adding the char
<Felishia>	is there a position or somethign in the event?
<Felishia>	to know where I should add the new char?
<Felishia>	eg
<Felishia>	"abcd" is my current input value
<Felishia>	user presses q
<Felishia>	I dunno if the result owuld be abqcd or abcdq
*	Torqable is now known as Torkable
<inimino>	Felishia: just wait for it to be updated
<Felishia>	inimino, nuuuu I'm supposed to validate
<inimino>	you don't do validation by preventing keystrokes for taking effect
<inimino>	*from
<cjohnson>	Felishia: keydown
<Felishia>	cjohnson, brb
<cjohnson>	you can check the incoming char on the event object, and if it's a bad char, you can event.preventDefault(); to prevent it appending to the input
<cjohnson>	sometimes I feel preventing keys is more logical
<cjohnson>	but usually yeah validation after the fact (on blur, on form submit) is best
<cofo>	hi
<cofo>	i wrote a loop for every class but sometime it is different due the post. So it throw an error. What is the best suggestion to deal with it?
<cjohnson>	!doesn't work @ cofo
<ecmabot>	cofo: What do you mean it doesn't work? Is it unemployed? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? What did you want or expect to happen?
<cjohnson>	!paste @ cofo
<ecmabot>	cofo: Show some code, but don't paste it on the channel. You can provide a test case we can run and help you with your problem with http://jsfiddle.net , http://jsbin.com , or http://requirebin.com . Sites like http://gist.github.com/ and http://bpaste.net are cool too.
<NBhosting>	does drageble work difrant on safari then in chrome? in chrome it triggers once, in safari it triggers every droppable it hovers over
<cofo>	I don't wanna paste my code
<cofo>	It's just i think sometime it is in array and sometime it doesn't.. I get this: Cannot read property 'text' of undefined
<NBhosting>	if u dont want to show us code, why ask at all?
<cofo>	can i show something similar?
<NBhosting>	why wouldnt u show it?
<cofo>	Anyone have deal with situation when you write a code but it's not match for all? What did you do to solve it?
<cofo>	I go through all classes in the array
<cjohnson>	paste code or we can't help you
<cjohnson>	if you want to test if a property exists on an object before you call it, you can use hasOwnProperty

<cofo>	Ah
<cofo>	so i need to make if statement for it?
<cofo>	But it's not clear for me this function/command
<cjohnson>	you want to do something IF a condition is met
<cjohnson>	so yes
<cjohnson>	read the docs, they give plenty of examples
<cofo>	cool
<cofo>	i didn't know how to start it
<MatixYo>	Let's say I have NodeList.
<MatixYo>	How can I get another list of unique parents of elements in given Nodelist?
<cjohnson>	MatixYo: you have a NodeList
<soon>	I'm completely new to JS and I'm going through the 3wschool tutorials ... just now the JavaScript Events. Simple enough: an HTML button calls a function onclick and the function changes an HTML paragraph .. document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = Date(); ... I figure I wanted the function to change the text in the button instead: document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = Date();
<cjohnson>	[].map.call(theNodeList, function(v) { return v.parentNode; });
<cjohnson>	that will give you an array of each item's parentNode MatixYo
<cofo>	Javascript shows me an array and also i go to the element. Is what you paste can help?
<cjohnson>	then you can do something to get unique
<MatixYo>	cjohnson: yes, but if two elements have the same parent it will give it twice to array
<soon>	so I chaned the function content to : this.innerHTML = Date();
<cjohnson>	right, so get something that will give you a unique array

<Felishia>	so for example the input current value is
<Felishia>	abc
<cjohnson>	soon: ok. so first of all, don't use inline handlers. secondly, it's new Date();, not just Date();
<Felishia>	and the keydown event says the new char is a q
<Felishia>	so what would the new string be?

<austeritysucks>	cjohnson, do you know how to check if a function in VBA returns an error?
<cjohnson>	this is ##javascript not ##vba ;)
<austeritysucks>	sorry you're right
<austeritysucks>	problem is there is no vba chat so this was the closest i figured
<cjohnson>	nope not likely to be the right place. I don't know VBA either
<cjohnson>	sorry
<cjohnson>	I'd try the mighty google
<inimino>	StackOverflow
<cjohnson>	"vba try/catch" perhaps
<cjohnson>	or SO if you're patient :)

<edwardbc>	antsanto: check for stuff like namespacing, module pattern, closures
<antsanto>	bradleymeck so your saying create fn objects and give ly accessor fn to outside world and let this fn object does what ever setting it needs
<antsanto>	Right?
<edwardbc>	this is an interesting article i stumbled accross a couple of days ago, might give you an idea to organize your code: https://www.airpair.com/javascript/posts/the-mind-boggling-universe-of-javascript-modules

<GreenJello_>	Berra, you can do pretty much anything with a fragment
*	athan_ is now known as athan
<GreenJello_>	it works like any other element, so yeah you can use selectors, etc.
<cofo>	Is it possible to save console.log output?
<GreenJello_>	CheesyNum, never do new Number
<cofo>	or to text ile?
<GreenJello_>	that might be your problem
<cofo>	file*
<GreenJello_>	Number() is okay, new Number() isn't
<CheesyNum>	Number(code here) didnt work either
<GreenJello_>	put console.log(xNumber) after line 11
<yansanmo>	getSelectedRow that accept an event is weird

<cofo>	Please how can I save output without VM:numberline
<renlo>	use node?
<cofo>	no idiea what is node
<cofo>	Is javascript is lanuage like high level language and it takes a lot time to learn>
<GreenJello_>	yes
<GreenJello_>	what's VM:numberline?
<cofo>	I want to learn it but if it will take me more than month i don't

<cofo>	Anyone is working (earning money) with JS?
<Berra>	You want to be a web-dev? Then learn JS, CSS, HTML (Consider Python, PHP, GoLang) cofo
<cofo>	Just asked..
<nribeka>	cofo: it's very lucrative :D
<Berra>	JS is not on the lucrative side on the scale when it comes to programming one must say.
<cofo>	I don't know
<Berra>	Lower tier .
<cofo>	I like it but it's look a lo effort
<cofo>	lot*
<Berra>	JS is most of the least effort you can put in when it comes to programming
<Berra>	Easiest to get into
<Berra>	And results are always very apparent
<Berra>	Good hand-holder

<cofo>	Why when you view a JS file you see it sophisticated?

<Berra>	JS is often minimized to save on bandwidth when sending it over the internet
<cofo>	How do you view it without an IDE?
<Berra>	Firefox for example has a prettyfy function built in that you can use
<Berra>	Just rightclick the code and prettify

<ezakimak>	Berra, JS is becoming quite lucrative
<ezakimak>	I know lots of devs making 6 figures doing JS
<Berra>	Yes but not in comparison to other programming fields (outside web specifically)
<bradleymeck>	i do js but never touch websites, but I am a little bit of an odd case
<ezakimak>	right, people don't generally use js for other than front/backends to web apps
<Torkable>	same
<Torkable>	but I'm a node dev
<bewl>	6 figures is doable for JS but rare
<Berra>	If you make 6 figures doing js it's not beacuse of JS it's because of the company you're employed at and speaks little of JS in comparison to other programming languages.
<ezakimak>	most backend daemons are java/c++/python these days
<Torkable>	Berra: what?
<bewl>	generally the devs in the 6 figures are full stack developers
<Berra>	Yes, it's has little to do with JS.
<Torkable>	6 figures for an experienced node dev is not rare imo
<cjohnson>	austeritysucks: that's exactly why I wouldn't use that Json() thing
<Torkable>	idk bout front end devs
<cjohnson>	it doesn't really give you anything
<ezakimak>	6 figures is actually a new norm in salaries actually
<cjohnson>	if you were just operating on the data directly you could check data.length to see how many there are
<cjohnson>	or just use data.forEach and it doesn't matter how many there are
<Berra>	Nodejs changed things a lot. Someone employed as backend Nodejs can't be compared to frontend js
<lyou333>	what location are we talking about here?
<Berra>	But Nodejs will come to an end.
<Torkable>	lol?
<ezakimak>	huh? since when?
<lyou333>	for bay area 6 figures is not suprising at all
<ezakimak>	it has a *growing* ecosystem
<cjohnson>	since Berra proclaimed it
<cjohnson>	it is said. so it shall be.
<Torkable>	lol
<bewl>	I dont know if 6 figures is the new norm *yet*
<ezakimak>	is his first name Yogi?
<bewl>	its approaching it though
<Berra>	Python + GoLang domination is on it's way.
<Torkable>	lol
<cjohnson>	lol
<ezakimak>	i dunno about go dominating
<ezakimak>	python is certainly gaining ground
<cjohnson>	that's a good one Berra
<ezakimak>	i think ruby is losing out to python
<bewl>	it definitely is
<Berra>	cjohnson: Yeah you're right. Technically superior doesn't mean popular.
<ezakimak>	it's become a niche tool now, rails seems all it's used for
<Torkable>	everyone I know that works with python complains
<Berra>	The plebs will keep Nodejs popular
<Torkable>	troll mode activated
<ezakimak>	python hurt itself with the incompatible 3.x changes
<Berra>	Same with PHP. It will remain popular because of low level programmers.
<ezakimak>	stalled it's own progress
<bewl>	Berra: true
<ezakimak>	PHP is just ubiquitous
<ezakimak>	very low entry barrier
<ezakimak>	and a very productive tool
<Berra>	ezakimak: Meh, Python3 hasn't hurt Python
<bewl>	ASP.NET is where i have settled
<cjohnson>	Berra: you're on a role with these jokes
<bewl>	and it pays very very well
<ezakimak>	yes, .net is going strong
<ezakimak>	dunno how much it's growing though
<lyou333>	especially with typescript
<bewl>	I'd say quite a bit in the last 3 yeras
<ezakimak>	but it's tied to adoption of MS offerings and platform, so it won't go away
<ezakimak>	azure has helped it a ton
<bewl>	yes it has
<Berra>	cjohnson: More specifically what do you disagree with me on?
<bewl>	Azure is pretty amazing actually
<ezakimak>	the only downside is it's not free
<cjohnson>	"hammers are better than screwdrivers" "But I want to drive in screws!" "doesn't matter, hammers are technically superior"
<bewl>	as with anything microsoft :P
<cjohnson>	it's just generally a very ignorant thing to say
<bewl>	but it usually pays for itself
<ezakimak>	well, the devs get paid that use it :)
<ezakimak>	the business has to bare the cost of the platform
<bewl>	I wish my company went down the Azure path
<Berra>	cjohnson: Do you agree NodeJs has become popular and is being used on projects that absolutely never should have been made in NodeJs? (And that this is more common than NodeJs being used when it's suited).
<ezakimak>	imo it makes no sense to pay for a platform when there's plenty of open source solutions
<cjohnson>	I think that's true of virtually every tool and platform since hte dawn of programming Berra
<bewl>	but it was years ago, and Azure really wasnt mature enough
<cjohnson>	but that's a strawman to what you said
<ezakimak>	the wrong tool for a job? happens all the time, but it's not the fault of the tool
<Berra>	I think it's especially true with NodeJs though
<ezakimak>	why so?
<ezakimak>	I highly doubt it.
<cjohnson>	do you have any figures to back that up?
<Torkable>	drink a perscription julep and ignore the haters
<cjohnson>	lol Torkable
<ezakimak>	xml and ejb? absolutely.
<bewl>	really though, i see things written in jQuery that should have been writting in knockoutjs
<Torkable>	ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ
<cjohnson>	either way berra if you just want to proclaim "python and golang > javascript" you're in the wrong channel
<bewl>	it applies to anything
<Berra>	No I don't. It's an opinion from observing.
<cjohnson>	even if you WERE completely right (which again, it's an ignorant thing to say, but for the sake of argument), it's ot productive to do so
<cjohnson>	here
<cjohnson>	don't troll
<Berra>	cjohnson: I was only talking about it being used in backend.
<cjohnson>	doesn't matter
<linman32>	is it a better to have multiple canvases instead of one big one?
<cjohnson>	it's nothing more than instigation
<jayjo>	Can I load all of my javascript and css through one import (to maybe another javascript file that loads all of the external files)
<ezakimak>	yes
<ezakimak>	there's tools to bundle
<cjohnson>	jayjo: browserify
<ezakimak>	^^
<ezakimak>	is one
<linman32>	assuming there are many shapes. and there is a single change between canvas renderings
<Berra>	jayjo: Avoid loading css with JS...
<bewl>	linman32: depends on what you are trying to acheive
<jayjo>	should I do one load of css and one load of javascript?
<ezakimak>	why does it matter how you load css?
<linman32>	bewl: there are many shapes on canvas and only small changes over time
<cjohnson>	it does seem rather pointless to not just append a <link> to the body and let it figure itself out
<cjohnson>	no need to XHR CSS
<bewl>	then one canvas should suffice
<ezakimak>	i do that via js
<cjohnson>	you open yourself up to extra restrictions
<cjohnson>	and you get no real benefit
<ArchaicEX>	Are there any particular disadvantages to using querySelector? I can't figure out why I never found mention of this function anywhere when I was getting introduced to JavaScript.
<Fenikkusu>	jayjo, I commonly use grunt to concat and minify js files.
<ezakimak>	i append/remove <link> tags dynamically as components are loaded/unloaded
<cjohnson>	ArchaicEX: nope, it's great. it's just somewhat new, so that's why not a lot of people use it
<cjohnson>	ezakimak: that's not loading via js though
<cjohnson>	that's loading via the browser
<ezakimak>	true. but you can also use require("!css:...)

<ezakimak>	or "!text:..." even
<cjohnson>	yeah but to what benefit
<ezakimak>	dependencies
<ezakimak>	no point in loading what isn't used
<linman32>	bewl: most of the canvas is the same, but a small portion changes over time. does that make sense?
<Berra>	ArchaicEX: Use getElementById if it's id, getElementByClassName if class, by tagname etc. Only use selectors for advanced nested selection of if you need to select data-* och psuedo states like :checked.
<ormaaj>	ArchaicEX: Probably because it isn't a core part of javascript.
<bewl>	linman32: yea it does. What is your concern with one canvas?
<ezakimak>	it's part of the DOM API
<bewl>	linman32: and this is really cool btw
<cjohnson>	querySelector('#foo') is pretty much analogous to getElementById
<linman32>	bewl: yeah, not my app, but they are awesome... i don't know how canvas works exactly
<cjohnson>	I'm sure they map to the same exact code underneath
<cjohnson>	I wouldn't use getElementById over querySelector for any sort of performance reasons
<linman32>	bewl: is it inefficient to redraw the entire canvas with many shapes?
<linman32>	bewl: such as when highlighting, it would require redrawing the entire canvas, right?
<bewl>	thats what the canvas is for
<ezakimak>	linman32, that is cool!!!
<bewl>	it is very efficient at things like that
<ezakimak>	i bet they just draw a shape on top with translucency
<bewl>	in this case,  dont see a need for multiple canvases
<linman32>	ezakimak: :)
<linman32>	they have multiple canvases. each row is a canvas
<bewl>	except maybe for things like that lower view
<ormaaj>	that would have to be a special-case optimization. More likely it uses the xpath code rather than the css code
<linman32>	bewl: how do you know? i'm new to js and html
<ezakimak>	it would be even cooler if they chopped up each measure into timing units and alternated shade of grey
<linman32>	ezakimak: hah... yeah...
<khmer>	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CE3MrvTUkAAuvDJ.png <-- it me
<ezakimak>	i can't remember the diff between a quarter and eigth pause marks
<bewl>	linman32: this all depends on how you want to approach your code
<linman32>	bewl: please, explain
<ezakimak>	you wrote that? nice!
<bewl>	i dont think he did, but he is interested in making something similar
<ezakimak>	oh
<ezakimak>	i was approached by a publisher to write a ko book
<linman32>	ezakimak: no! i'm doing something similar, and coinciently, it has the alternate highlighting thing
<linman32>	ezakimak: but it can't play music, very early... just a coincidence
<linman32>	ezakimak: yeah jellynote is cool. i respect them
<bewl>	linman32: make sure you arent trying to code this from a visual standpoint
<bewl>	form follows function
<linman32>	bewl: what do u mean? ... see the second post? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3099322/how-to-add-undo-functionality-to-html5-canvas
<bewl>	Think of this in terms of data, then figure out how you want to handle/process that data
<linman32>	bewl: it sounds like you have to repaint everything for these things
<bewl>	thats how canvas works
<bewl>	there arent dom elements, there is a redraw every frame
<linman32>	but then it is inefficinet for one canvas. highlighting a note redraws the entire score. as opposed to just a measure w/ multiple canvas
<giuseppesolinas>	hello
<foofin>	Hello!
<giuseppesolinas>	:)
<bewl>	there ya go :)
<bewl>	so you've made up your mind then!
<bewl>	It would be more efficient to do it that way, yes.
<linman32>	bewl: but u said "it is very efficient at things like that"
<bewl>	But there isnt a whole lot happening, and canvas can handle this entire screen without a problem
<ezakimak>	it's not like there's a high framerate required
<linman32>	hmm
<epichero>	no need to prematurely optimize, adding more layers would just complicate things (if that's what you are considering)
<bewl>	like i said though linman32, the problem domain doesnt exist within the canvas technology itself, but rather the way you are writing the application
<ezakimak>	if you just encapsulate all your drawing commands into, well, "command" objects and stuff them into a list, you can easily pop off the end to undo
<bewl>	and that is a question that no one can really answer here
<linman32>	sure. but then there is optimizations (e.g. what if i turned all the notes into an image, so it sped up canvas redraw)
<bewl>	i personally would be 100% ok with prototyping something out so that it 'works'
<bewl>	then work on refactoring/optimizing after the fact
<bewl>	get your rough draft doing
<bewl>	going*
<linman32>	ok
<bewl>	by doing that, you will be answering your own questions as you progress
<linman32>	where can i learn about canvas optimization techniques?
<bewl>	maybe look into a framework
<bewl>	like EaselJS or KineticJS
<ezakimak>	what does paperjs use?
<ezakimak>	their stuff is amazing
<linman32>	ok. thanks guys. appriciate the help
<bewl>	paperjs is also awesome
<bewl>	its still a canvas wrapper
<bewl>	but they have this thing called PaperScript
<bewl>	which looks like it gives you math operators for Point and Size objects
<bewl>	I havent had too much exposure to canvas though
<bewl>	not as much as i'd like
<ezakimak>	i've never actually used it--just played with their demos
<alpha->	n
<alpha->	hello
<foofin>	Hello!
<epichero>	i've tried out a bunch of them as of a couple years ago, checking now it looks like easeljs is still meant for easing flash devs into it and paperjs is unchanged as well
<alpha->	I have a simple script that does document.write('<a href = "document.html">')... this works as intended, except I have a question
<ezakimak>	!write
<ezakimak>	!document.write
<ecmabot>	ezakimak: document.wrong. Please use something more modern and less prone to doing confusing things. This function tries to write to the current document. If the document has already been processed, the document will be replaced with a blank one with your argument. If you don't want that, use the proper DOM methods instead.
<bewl>	LOL
<bewl>	document.wrong
<alpha->	since this creates relative URLs, I would like to know what affects the base url prepended to the relative address ?
<alpha->	ezakimak I didn't write this
<SmashingX>	I am currently using the Javascript API by youtube to display a video on my web page however now I want to also retrieve the youtube description from the video id? How would I go about doing this?
<ezakimak>	doesn't mean you can't fix it
<SmashingX>	I only want description and title:
<alpha->	the problem is that the same document.write script on 2 different domains produces relative urls that are different
<alpha->	eg. one uses the domain only
*	cool_boy_ is now known as cool_boy
<alpha->	but another uses the domain + current page
<alpha->	if that makes sense ..
<ljharb>	the only real fix is to remove document.write
<ezakimak>	how are they different? post a gist with sample inputs and outputs
<alpha->	1 sec
<jaawerth>	I was gonna say - if you have a problem and you're using document.write, the problem is document.write ;-)
<ezakimak>	and the desired outputs
<ormaaj>	As you get more "modern" things can get annoying. Try dealing exclusively with things like document.appendChild(document.createElementNS(blah, blerg)) sometime. Maybe throw in some SVG for good measure.
<alpha->	ezakimak http://paste.debian.net/hidden/f76f515d/
<alpha->	(again, I didn't write any of this mess, I just need to make it work on domain B same as on A, that's all)
<ezakimak>	iirc there is a header field for baseurl--do either of them set it?
<alpha->	HTTP header?
<ezakimak>	no, html <head>
<ezakimak>	!mdn <base>
<ecmabot>	ezakimak: &lt;base&gt; - HTML (HyperText Markup Language) | MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base>
<ezakimak>	afaik, that's what controls relative urls
<ezakimak>	do both webservers behave the same? no 304s involved?
<epichero>	it is ezakimak, i've not really had to actively think about this for years but yes
<enitiz>	hello
<foofin>	Hello!
<alpha->	ezakimak 1 second please friend
<enitiz>	i want to make a blog/portfolio for myself
<alpha->	I have found that the page is executing another piece of javascript
<epichero>	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base
<alpha->	and there is hardcoded urls to  domain A
<gambl0re>	what do you call somebody who knows only jquery and not javascript?
<alpha->	and it's doing some vague replacements
<enitiz>	but i have some idea
<enitiz>	css has this box model right
<enitiz>	can i make a function in javascript that returns
<ezakimak>	gambl0re, someone that doesn't realize that they *do* know some javascript.
<enitiz>	a box with some attributes that i provide
*	MichD is now known as michd
<ezakimak>	a "box"?
<enitiz>	like abox = makemeabox(font="consolas", bgcolor="green", h="20", w="50", textcolor="white");
<ezakimak>	i want a box filled with gold.
<enitiz>	then
<enitiz>	put(abox, "someplaceinpage");
<enitiz>	i know i sound stupid though
<bewl>	how is that any better than traditional css?
<ezakimak>	well, you can do var div = document.createElement('div'); and set the styles on it, and appendChild() it to wherever you want it to go
<ezakimak>	so, yes.
<becom33>	hello I know question will sound bit off . is there anyway I can get "Url" equal to "alert(1)"  in code "var Url = "/taks/" + location.hash;" ?
<becom33>	I can add anything to the back of the url
<ezakimak>	huh?
<bewl>	Url = function() { alert(1) };
<ezakimak>	where is this string going?
<becom33>	bewl: no no I dont have any control over a the website
<ezakimak>	if it's for an href, iirc you can do "javascript:alert(1)"
<enitiz>	bewl: maybe i can build a page all by script?
<enitiz>	and can reuse components?
<becom33>	Im doing a penetration test and I found this code in the website
<becom33>	Im trying see if its exploitable
<ezakimak>	if you can't control the entire string, i don't think you can do anything much
<becom33>	website is "http://sample.com/tasks/#11111" I can add anything into the back
<ljharb>	enitiz: why are you doing `font = ` etc?
<tongcx>	I just wrote a blog portraying programming languages as girls https://medium.com/@tongcx/programming-language-11dd5db26a7d
<ljharb>	enitiz: that's not a JS technique and probably doesn't do what you think
<becom33>	I tried #1111;alert(1) doesnt work since it goes as a string
<enitiz>	ljharb:  not js exactly.. this is just in my head
<Fenikkusu>	becom33, you may wish to look into arachni
<enitiz>	the idea behind being, my page is a collection of boxes
<becom33>	Fenikkusu: I know about it . but Im not suppose to use automated scanners
<enitiz>	so what if i forgot html and css for a moment
<Fenikkusu>	becom33, that is an interesting restriction...test?
<enitiz>	and think of making a list of boxes
<Hannibal_Smith>	tongcx, I think that that kind of post are not generally liked...but I read the first one about C++ and it's fun :-P
<becom33>	Fenikkusu: some customers don't like automated tools because of the junk posts and mess it leaves behind after the test is been done
<mmmveggies>	that's just a poorly written tool then
<Fenikkusu>	becom33, if you've access to the DB/site, just dupe it to vagrant and test against vagrant.
<Hannibal_Smith>	tongcx, also nice the manga style girls...from where they came from?
<becom33>	Fenikkusu: I current do not have access to anything
<becom33>	I only found that what I showed you before
<enitiz>	hmm
<tongcx>	Hannibal_Smith: i found them online
<aphid>	so.. I'm making a XHR request to grab some JSON from another domain which has CORS headers enabled.  Chrome has no problem with it.  Firefox barfs with "Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at [url].  Any advice on troubleshooting this?
<becom33>	which I have a chance of inject javascript into the fontend
<tongcx>	Hannibal_Smith: any reasons why it's generally not liked?
<becom33>	its still goes as a string
<Hannibal_Smith>	tongcx, because it's a reccurring joke
<ezakimak>	aphid, read up on CORS on the html5rocks article about it
<Fenikkusu>	aphid, you have to add a header to the secondary site that permits the primary to access it.
<tongcx>	Hannibal_Smith: haha, sure, I didn't try to bash/compliment one specific language, I just try to show their different personalities
<Hannibal_Smith>	tongcx, it goes back to things like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7JNNbvKj8o
<cjohnson>	aphid: inspect the request in both browsers
<aphid>	CORS is enabled on the secondary site.  access-control-allow-origin:*
<Hannibal_Smith>	(probably you know about it)
<cjohnson>	make sure the remove server is actually sending the header with both
<cjohnson>	and make sure the url is the same in both. same protocol, port, and domain
<epichero>	and it's only on firefox... hmm
<cjohnson>	if you're doing https in one andh ttp in the other
<aphid>	the request doesn't show up in network tab on firefox dev tools
<aphid>	it's the same code
<cjohnson>	doesn't mean it's running the same
<cjohnson>	dump the url in both, compare
<ezakimak>	aphid, there are other headers
<cjohnson>	then use curl command line to inspect the headers that url sends maybe
<ezakimak>	there is also an access-control-allow-method I think
<ezakimak>	that html5rocks article goes over all of it
<Hannibal_Smith>	tongcx, ahaha it's really nice how they used Kurisu Makise for Haskell
<Hannibal_Smith>	(or it was by you?)
<alpha->	ezakimak it was the hardcoded domains in other script
*	robertmaxrees is now known as robertLunch
<alpha->	that was rewriting every url after page load
<alpha->	thank you for help anyway, rubber ducky is big help
<alpha->	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging
<Hannibal_Smith>	Anyway tongcx all that page is really well written!
<tongcx>	Hannibal_Smith: Kurisu is my choice :)
<aphid>	hmm.  well, firefox is firing req.onerror.  looking at the request object for clues.   withCredentials is false, but the CORS headers allow anonymous loading so ... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<tongcx>	Hannibal_Smith: I made that one
<Hannibal_Smith>	tongcx, it's nice some jokes like "I know her sister OCaml pretty well, I can only speculate things about her from gossips."
<Hannibal_Smith>	Because it's actually really true
<Hannibal_Smith>	A good number of people (myself included) prefer OCaml because it's a more "practical" language
<tongcx>	Hannibal_Smith: haha, thanks
<tach4n>	tongcx: where did the other pictures come from?
<epichero>	I've set up a really nice OCaml workflow so i can never use OCaml for anything
<Hannibal_Smith>	epichero, ahahah
<ezakimak>	how many humps does an OCaml have?
<epichero>	merlin/tuareg/opam/utop i demand they are all updated and working properly
<epichero>	so i can never use it properly ofc
<tongcx>	tach4n: I just added the reference. It's from a Chinese post on same topic but with less geek perspective
<Hannibal_Smith>	epichero, they works ok for me :-P
<Hannibal_Smith>	(and hope for other OCaml dev)
<aphid>	waaat.  when I change the request to https from http it works
<epichero>	oh geeze, i just assumed it was already https
<diamonds>	somebody suggest a tool for API testing
<epichero>	whisky
<aphid>	epichero: why would it matter?
<aphid>	chrome doesn't seem to care.
<diamonds>	epichero: this? https://github.com/cloudkick/whiskey
<epichero>	no, i just drink a lot of whisky when api's don't work
<diamonds>	general purpose test runner?
<diamonds>	oh
<epichero>	what type of api testing?
<epichero>	it's a bit vague
<diamonds>	for better or worse you can add .js to any word & find it on github
<epichero>	that's true
*	Mango_Man is now known as nucleartide2
<ezakimak>	dicss.js project is hilarious
<diamonds>	epichero: "when I GET /users/123/ then I should get {x:1,y:2}; when I GET /users/928475982 I should get 404" etc.
<ezakimak>	esp. since it's actually useful
*	Guest___ is now known as Caine
<diamonds>	"Just grab DICSS and stick it wherever you like. DICSS works equally well in your <head> or in your <body>."
*	diamonds groans
<epichero>	there are api testing libraries built on any framework you can imagine, like http://frisbyjs.com/
<epichero>	is for jasmine
<diamonds>	yeah epichero frisby is the one I found
<epichero>	while developing you can get quick confirmation via browser rest clients like https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo?hl=en-US
<epichero>	and i haven't used this one i don't think i just looked up one that was decently rated for an example
<diamonds>	mmm will try that one
<ezakimak>	the issue tracker is full of some great quips too
<epichero>	http://insomnia.rest/ looks really polished, my curiosity will force me to try this out now... great
*	blizzy is now known as _blizzy_
<diamonds>	I wouldn't go that far ezakimak... ;)
<no_gravity>	Is this valid javascript? var i=1; var i=2;
<ezakimak>	i think that depends on whether it's strict mode or not
<epichero>	you don't have to write the 2nd var, and i think it fails in strict but not positive
<ezakimak>	i'm also unsure of the behavior of var i; function i() {}; in either mode
<diamonds>	doesn't seem to error in node even with strict mode
<diamonds>	>> 'use strict'; var i = 1; var i = 2;

<claytonzaugg>	or an object builder taking in the prototrype
<claytonzaugg>	prototype
<ezakimak>	Object.create() *is* an object builder that takes in the prototype
<epichero>	it won't create a global in strict
<ezakimak>	doesn't it get hoisted either way?
<claytonzaugg>	so var foo = Object.create(prototype);
<ezakimak>	only if you left out the var entirely would it become global in non-strict?
<ezakimak>	yes
<claytonzaugg>	okay let me give that a try and see if it does what I need.  Thank you!
<no_gravity>	looks like "i=1;var i=2;" deletes window.i and creates a local i.
<cjohnson>	aphid: cool
<cjohnson>	I support this
<cjohnson>	I think this is a move in conjunction with their plan to do some sort of half-assed HTTPS over HTTP thing
<ezakimak>	i think it's stupid
<cjohnson>	it doesn't provide MITM protection but it at least encrypts the data
<cjohnson>	which is basically not that useful, but at least gets things moving toward https
<cjohnson>	there's basically no reason to not use https
<cjohnson>	at all
<ezakimak>	sure there is. we do not want people in the habit of accepting self-signed certs everywhere!
<cjohnson>	that's a strawman
<cjohnson>	1: there are several free and easy to use ssl CAs
<ezakimak>	it's already hard enough to get people to check that there is https, let alone to check the type of cert?
<cjohnson>	2: we could easily improve the tech stack to be more supportive of self-signed certs, if the browsers were so inclined, to where a self-signed cert isn't treated as "basically insecure"
<cjohnson>	because it's not
<cjohnson>	despite it being presented as such
<mcoffee>	The default eslint style doesn't give line numbers. And none of the other pre-installed ones do either. But as I understand, it eslint does output something that a computer program may understand. So, is there any tools out there that accepts the format outputed by eslint, and pretty-prints it with line numbers?
<ezakimak>	sure, the data is secure to the server, but there's still no authenticity as to the server itself
<cjohnson>	there's nothing inherently wrong with self-signed certs. there just needs to be better UI around it
<aphid>	http://letsencrypt.org/ is coming.
<cjohnson>	I'm pretty sure we had this debate already, and you were here for it, and that's just not true
<Fenikkusu>	cjohnson, the problem isn't that the self-signed isn't secure, but rather that there is no way to prove an underlying intrusion isn't happening.
<mcoffee>	Never mind.
<ezakimak>	I agree--we need better UI around *all things* security in general
<mcoffee>	"compact" is not *that* hard to read.
<ezakimak>	self-signed allows MITM
<aphid>	free CA cert in 2 lines.
<cjohnson>	yeah that's the other thing
<cjohnson>	self-signed not being inherently any worse than signed by some arbitrary for-pay company aside
<Hannibal_Smith>	<aphid> wait what https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/04/30/deprecating-non-secure-http/ <-Mozilla will try suicide even harder...good for them
<ezakimak>	so it really doesn't actually add any security value
<cjohnson>	there are freely available certs, regardless
<cjohnson>	easy to use
<aphid>	"No validation emails, no complicated configuration editing, no expired certificates breaking your website. And of course, because Let’s Encrypt provides certificates for free, no need to arrange payment."
<ezakimak>	ff is slow anyways. until they get electrolysis done it's far less usable
<cjohnson>	from already-accepted CAs
<ezakimak>	i don't see how free certs are a service
<cjohnson>	because paying for a cert doesn't improve security in any way
<cjohnson>	it doesn't guarantee anything that a free one doesn't
<ezakimak>	the reason certs *cost* is because they are supposed to validate the recipient's identity and business credentials--which costs resources to do
<cjohnson>	lol
<AtomicB0mB>	how can I discovery the classes on an object? Like i want to know the classes of my "footer" tag. What is the syntax? document.getElementsByTagName("footer").getClass something like that
<cjohnson>	it doesn't validate a thing other than the fact that you have some money
<ezakimak>	if that validation is not taking place, then free, acceptible everywhere certs actually *undermines* the existing ecosystem of validated paid-for certs
<no_gravity>	>> x={1.23: "hello"}; a=[]; for (key in x) { a.push(key); } typeof(a[0]);

<merpnderp>	Is there a way to rewrite this without using a regex?  result.BirthDate.replace(/T.*/, "");
<SmashingX>	I am currently using the Javascript API by youtube to display a video on my web page however now I want to also retrieve the youtube description from the video id? How would I go about doing this?
<SmashingX>	I only want description and title:

<cjohnson>	merpnderp: how come?
<cjohnson>	aphid: ah right. danke
<cjohnson>	SmashingX: read their API docs I'm sure
<merpnderp>	cjohnson: because somehow between Visual Studio's magic and the typescript compiler, once all my TS is concatted into a single file, that line throws exceptions in every browser.
<SmashingX>	I did already
<cjohnson>	great, did you implement the code their docs suggested?
<cjohnson>	are you having trouble with a specific bit of code?
<cjohnson>	merpnderp: hrm, sounds like a prob with one of those tools then
<cjohnson>	I would fix that instead of just randomly replacing bits of valid code to make them happy
<ezakimak>	merpnderp, that's probably because */ is an end-comment-delimiter
<merpnderp>	cjohnson: I can't get rid of VS or TS :( And they are black boxes of "magic" that when something goes wrong are impossible to debug.
<merpnderp>	ezakimak: exactly my thoughts. Somehow it is getting jacked up with a begin comment from all the file concats
<cjohnson>	it's perfectly valid code, and your tools are breaking on it. the tools are broken
<merpnderp>	ezakimak: I'm trying to think of another way to do that line.
<cjohnson>	you can't replace broken tools?
<ezakimak>	you could use the RegEx constructor and build the pattern via two strings concatted, '/T.*' + '/'
<merpnderp>	cjohnson: no, I work for a giant MS shop. I don't get to pick my tools :/
<cjohnson>	damn, that sucks
<cjohnson>	yeah I'd prob do that then
<cjohnson>	concat strings
<Hannibal_Smith>	merpnderp, I will try to use last VS 2015 RC
<merpnderp>	cjohnson: yeah....after fighting this all morning I brought my laptop in to update my resume.
<cjohnson>	haha
<ezakimak>	or if it still works use parens /(T.*)/
<merpnderp>	cjohnson: sucks because I really like everyone I work with and thousands of people use my tools. But man this env is teh suckz
<Hannibal_Smith>	Is really strange that TS compiler has a bug like the one you are talking about now
<merpnderp>	ezakimak: oh snap, that's clever. Use a group capture to break it up :D
<aphid>	precarious stack :-/
<merpnderp>	Hannibal_Smith: I don't know where the bug is....all I know is it is valid code and works if I don't concat the files.
<xckpd7>	hmm... would it be wise to make people use 'strict' in a style guide?
<xckpd7>	I'm looking at google's style guide and they don't mention it at all
<ezakimak>	merpnderp, strict could also be an issue--when you concat you lose/gain strict depending on how the code is organized
<aphid>	i've been digging the airbnb guide aside from their "no es6 generators/iterators"
<cjohnson>	take anything with a grain of salt anyway
<aphid>	https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js/ is good
<cjohnson>	but their points are valid
<[clay]>	question: have an api and a offline process which handles the same object types. what's the recommended method for sharing those objects/classes? in java i'd just stick them in a jar and put the jar in both projects. what's the javascript version of this?
<cjohnson>	prefer functions without side effects , and generators probably don't compile wonderfully
<cjohnson>	yet
<ezakimak>	oh I forgot about that guide
<ezakimak>	js does not have classes
<aphid>	https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/coding-style <-- burn this with fire.
<aphid>	"Semicolons: Don't use them except in four situations"   FFUUUUUUUU
<ezakimak>	death to 2-space indentation.
<[clay]>	ezakimak, in es6 it does
<ormaaj>	js had to invent some funny new mechanisms to deal with iterators due to its "specialness"
<aphid>	npm guide is no-semicolon comma first
<ezakimak>	yeah, no. ASI exists because they are *required*, and knowing where the compiler will insert them for you is not something devs should be thinking about
<ezakimak>	no, es6 adds a sugar, it doesn't actually add any different concept
<ezakimak>	that is a hideous convention
<[clay]>	well, that's beside the point. i've got some bookshelf objects i'd like to use in two separate projects. what's the best method to share them without having to maintain two separate files
<cjohnson>	module
<ezakimak>	are you talking about two different javascript applications, or javascript and another language?
<ezakimak>	is this just json data?
<[clay]>	two javascript apps. not just json
<ezakimak>	so you have a custom serialization format?
<[clay]>	the two apps don't really talk, except through messaging. one reads the objects out of the db, other puts them in there because it does a lot of processing
<cjohnson>	then the db solves the problem with
<cjohnson>	right*
<aphid>	so the JSON will have the object minus methods, right?
<ezakimak>	json is just string data
<sonthonax>	Okay, so would anyone here actually recomend jest-cli?
<cjohnson>	if you want shared logic, use a module
<cjohnson>	if you just want shared data, your db or other API should cover that
<ezakimak>	^^^ sounds like problem solved to me.
<merpnderp>	found the bug. Either VS or TS's file concat is truncating files that end with a comment.
<ezakimak>	a whitespace preservation bug
<[clay]>	ok. shared object / logic. not worried about the shared data thing
<ezakimak>	(comments count as whitespace)
<ezakimak>	well, almost.
<aphid>	gross
<ezakimak>	what is?
<aphid>	the bug
<cjohnson>	[clay]: cool. module.
<ezakimak>	has it already been reported?
<ezakimak>	you could just add a ';' to the end of the file after the comment
<[clay]>	cjohnson, what's the mechanism for sharing a module? are we talking npm or something else? i'm relatively newb in this regard
<ezakimak>	of course, sounds like some of the files aren't even your code but libs
<[clay]>	i mean i understand what a module is
<ezakimak>	you import it in both apps
<ezakimak>	how depends on the module format you choose. es6/requirejs/other/
<[clay]>	no i get know how to use it - i'm just trying to figure out the javascript analog to a .jar file
<cjohnson>	[clay]: npm yeah
<ezakimak>	it would be a .js file
<cjohnson>	each program has its own package.json that defines your common module as a dependency
<cjohnson>	they each import that module
<ezakimak>	if you concat two together, it's still a .js file
<cjohnson>	you don't have to use npm. you could use anything
<cjohnson>	just have them both include that one file

<diamonds>	[clay]: there isn't one really, a zip/tarball format for js modules
<diamonds>	if you rly want one you could check out https://www.npmjs.com/package/taco
<[clay]>	ah ok. good to know. thanks.
<diamonds>	I don't really understand what taco does tho :)
<ezakimak>	minify + concat is the norm
<ezakimak>	for client side, if the webserver is configured for it you can have the files sent out compressed also
<ezakimak>	does nothing for server side though
<aphid>	http2 will help
<cjohnson>	http2+gzip pretty much removes the need to do any of that stuff
<cjohnson>	then clientside and serverside can work basically teh same

<beaky>	btw what are those 2 (magic_quotes and register_globals)
<diamonds>	beaky: I mean don't get me wrong, I rely on it :p
<beaky>	lol
<mmlac>	Is there a way to define a variable by using an asynchronous call and make multiple pieces of code wait for it?
<cjohnson>	beaky: register_globals would automatically turn any query parameter into a variable in your code
<cjohnson>	so if I went to index.php?foo=bar  and the code used $foo, it would automatically include my un-sanitized input
<beaky>	wow thats incredibly unsafe lol
<cjohnson>	yeah
<diamonds>	line 5: module.export = { foo : foo, bar : bar }; /*lines 20-1000*/: function foo function bar etc.
<cjohnson>	and magic_quotes was an attempt to fix that, I think, but automatically escaping all quotes from the query inputs
<diamonds>	let's your sorta see the API at a glance
<mmlac>	i.e. I call the server with isEnabled() then render() as well as (print() should only continue once isEnabled() finished and retunrned true
<cjohnson>	but then it sets the dev expectation not to sanitize anything which obv doesn't help for hte other 80% of inputs
<diamonds>	cjohnson: well I think magic_quotes was used more broadly-- "no need to sanitize your SQL params!" sorta
<cjohnson>	hahahahaha
<cjohnson>	sigh
<diamonds>	jolly bad show ofc but it's been deprecated for... years? years and years
<cjohnson>	yeah that is the other thing, in PHP it used to be really common to simply escape quotes for your db queries
<cjohnson>	despite needing several more things escaped. fortunately mysql_real_escape_string is much more prominent now
<diamonds>	naturally that doesn't stop Internet Commenters from harping on it from now until eternity

<matthavard1>	Hey so I have a function where I need to instatiate two booleans at the top to false(y).  To me, there is just something so clean about the look of defining them as function parameters as in `function foo (arg1, arg2, booleanVar1, booleanVar2)` instead of `function foo(arg1, arg2) {\n\tvar booleanVar1,\n\t\tbooleanVar2; /* rest of the function /* }`
<matthavard1>	but does that look weird or is it bad for performance?
<Torkable>	its weird
<falafel>	matthavard1, it would make no difference, but if they are not arguments, then why?

<ecmabot>	falafel: SyntaxError: octal literals and octal escape sequences are deprecated
<jaawerth>	yeah
<jaawerth>	octal
<jaawerth>	pfft
<jaawerth>	I mean I get WHY it's octal
<jaawerth>	but then you have operators for actually performing 2's and crap with it
<jaawerth>	2's complement*
<falafel>	b>0o11
<babelbot>	falafel: 9
<xecycle>	>> var x=6; x&(-x)
<ecmabot>	xecycle: (number) 2
<xecycle>	hmm well-known trick for least significant bit; no idea how is this useful
<jaawerth>	it's crazy useful in assembly ;-)
<xecycle>	but not in js
<xecycle>	well, ~~ has an interesting effect compared to Math.round, in that it truncates to 32 bits --- and this is the max length of arrays.
<xecycle>	but practically not many applications will reach this limit, anyway.
<doug16k>	xecycle, && and || are actually flow control instructions within the expression, because they only affect which part of the expression gets evaluated
<doug16k>	&& means "jump over the evaluation of the right hand side if the left hand side is false, and use the left hand side as the current value
<xecycle>	doug16k: I guess it's more in that other compound assignments always evaluate RHS.
<doug16k>	|| means jump if left side is true
<doug16k>	in C they actually compute values, you get 0 or 1
<doug16k>	in javascript you get the last evaluated value
<doug16k>	js> "this is true" && (false || "hello")
<ecmabot>	doug16k: (string) 'hello'
<doug16k>	js> "this is true" && (false || "hello") && "this got evaluated last"
<ecmabot>	doug16k: (string) 'this got evaluated last'
<doug16k>	js> "this is true" && (true || "hello") || "this got evaluated last"
<ecmabot>	doug16k: (boolean) true
<jaawerth>	it'd be fun if you could negate that in a boolean fashion
<jaawerth>	and by fun I mean confusing as hell
<doug16k>	just flow control, && and || have no real effect on value themselves, only which side's value flows through
<xecycle>	I have some code like (flagA && "A") || (flagB && "B") || ...
<doug16k>	a chain of || will "return" the first truthy one
<doug16k>	a chain of && will return the first falsy one
<doug16k>	and if it runs out of things, the last thing
<doug16k>	so it will work... the final && will return truthy and the result is the whole expression is truthy
<SmashingX>	I have this code, I accomplished what I wanted which is to show a red message saying that they haven’t filled in the field, but if I click it again it doesn’t clear. How could I that? http://jsbin.com/dikikoxori/1/edit?html,js,output

<doug16k>	SmashingX, listen for a focus event and clear it there
<doug16k>	focus and or input
<ljharb>	it's simpler than that. `a && b` returns a if it's falsy, else b. `a || b` returns a if it's truthy, else b.
<doug16k>	it's actually a flow control operator, routing the evaluation into or not into pieces of the expression
<doug16k>	they* && ||
<ljharb>	it's more of an expression selection. the side effect of that is that it can be abused for flow control.
<ljharb>	it's definitely not a boolean operation tho
<doug16k>	essentially a "jump over the code that evaluates the right side" with the left side opposite condition is true. "jump over right hand side if true" for ||, or, "jump over right hand side if left is not true" for &&
<Agamemnus>	'He suggested international laws to extradite criminals profiting off of fake buyouts before murmuring, "by the way, they could be fourteen years old!"'
<doug16k>	ljharb, it is frequently used, as in var height = (options && options.height) || defaultOptions.height;
<ljharb>	right but i offered a simpler explanation because the "jump" stuff is more confusing to understand :-)
<ljharb>	doug16k: in that case it's value selection.

<doug16k>	no because it won't even evaluate those other parts
<SmashingX>	It should say You typed an 1 which doesn't exist, please try again
<doug16k>	it is important to be fully aware of short circuit evaluation
<ljharb>	yes but "what gets evaluated" is irrelevant to the semantic of how it's used.
<ljharb>	the way i described it, "return" means "short circuit", and it's clear.
<ljharb>	it just doesn't add much to insist that people learn how engines work while learning to drive a car :-) even if it's helpful to know.
<user_corrupt>	I have the following html content with form: http://pastie.org/10189684#49-50 being added to the following jquery ui modal dialog: http://pastie.org/10189683#38 and I’m just trying to figure out how to pass the contents of the text input into the variable called “postMessage”, when the form is submitted. Any suggestions?
<SmashingX>	why when I type 1 in the textbox it doesn’t display the message for the string 1?http://jsbin.com/dikikoxori/1/edit?html,js,output
<SmashingX>	It should say You typed an 1 which doesn't exist, please try again
<doug16k>	SmashingX, obviously check the debugger console when debugging: ncaught TypeError: Failed to execute 'removeChild' on 'Node': parameter 1 is not of type 'Node'.
<SmashingX>	jsbin doesn’t have error message I don’t see those errors :/
<doug16k>	jsbin makes it almost impossible to debug
<doug16k>	use something with less overhead and magic like jsfiddle
<SmashingX>	what do you think is wrong then doug16k ?
<doug16k>	somewhere you do something.removeChild(badThing) with a bad badThing
<doug16k>	that's what the error says anyways
<SmashingX>	ok I pasted everything to jsfiddle but where’s the console?
<doug16k>	f12, console
<SmashingX>	I don’t see any errors
<doug16k>	then run at the top
<doug16k>	save it and show url?
<SmashingX>	I see it
<SmashingX>	now
<SmashingX>	Uncaught ReferenceError: validateForm is not defined
<SmashingX>	how’s possible that I can see the message on jsbin but not on jsfiddle
<doug16k>	another suggestion: in the sources tab, click the little stop sign shaped thing with pause icon in the center
<doug16k>	that will make it just break into the debugger on error
<doug16k>	and you can look at stuff in the console
<doug16k>	or watch window
<doug16k>	or mouseover variables in the sources view to see their value
<doug16k>	in chrome anyway. most debuggers have that though
<doug16k>	oh that stop sign thing is in the far top right
<doug16k>	of the sources pane
<doug16k>	that being on alone will make debugging 10x more productive
<SmashingX>	cool doug16k thanks for the suggestion
<SmashingX>	although I don’t understand it
<SmashingX>	<input type="button" name="submit" value="Submit" onclick="validateForm();">
<SmashingX>	I don’t see anything wrong with it
<doug16k>	save the fiddle and paste the link here
<SmashingX>	ValidateForm is not defined?
<SmashingX>	WTF
<doug16k>	V or v ??
<SmashingX>	http://jsfiddle.net/7o2g3bzb/
<doug16k>	don't do that. onclick is hiddeous and amateurish
<Agamemnus>	!inline
<ecmabot>	Agamemnus: Using inline event handlers is bad practice and results in poorly factored, hard-to-manage code. Consider attaching your events with Javascript, instead, eg: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener
<SmashingX>	ok
<SmashingX>	doug16k: then I don’t see where the error is
<doug16k>	also, don't make a submit button. make an event handler that handles submit
<doug16k>	then the input type="submit" will naturally work
<doug16k>	1 sec
<ljharb>	<button type="submit"></button> is better tho :-)
<user_corrupt>	any suggestions? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30251974/jquery-ui-confirmation-dialog-form-pass-variable
<doug16k>	this fixes the obsolete onclick: http://jsfiddle.net/7o2g3bzb/2/   now the other problems...
<doug16k>	you should avoid ids, I'll change it to use a class and look within the form being submitted for that span
<SmashingX>	doug16k: CSRF verification failed. Request aborted.
<kopasetik>	QUESTION: why does foo.x end up being undefined here: http://jsfiddle.net/5fe7azeo/
<doug16k>	SmashingX, you don't expect jsfiddle to magically have a backend request handler for this fiddle, do you?
<ljharb>	kopasetik: because you redefined "foo"
<doug16k>	there is no action on the form - it submits to jsfiddle
<ljharb>	kopasetik: the original n: 1 object does get x: { n: 1}
<ljharb>	kopasetik: but foo becomes { n: 2 }, and that, .x, is undefined.
<kopasetik>	how does  var x = y = z work in general?
<kopasetik>	not sure what the order is
<doug16k>	SmashingX, you are implementing CSRF defense?
<GreenJello_>	var x = (y = z)
<doug16k>	it has to be right to left. how else can it know what to assign?
<GreenJello_>	y = z; var x = y;
<kopasetik>	GreenJello_: thanks
<ljharb>	kopasetik: but why would you ever do that? it's horrible and unreadable code.
<ljharb>	assign one thing at a time.
<kakashiA1>	I am using passportJS and it uses only two arguments, username and password. How can tell passport to use more argments, (username, password, foo and bar)?
<doug16k>	assign right side value to left side lvalue. it has to evaluate the right side to know what to store in the left side
<doug16k>	I have compilers on the brain today. sorry
<rcyr>	kakashiA1: Have you tried using .bind?
<falafel>	kakashiA1, make a function that takes foo and bar, and returns the function that takes username and password
<doug16k>	and yeah, never ever to a = b = c. do a = c; b = c;
<kopasetik>	ljharb: it's one of those code interview questions... https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions
<kakashiA1>	falafel, rcyr: I dont know what you mean, but I am using a strategy to register (save in database) a user, there I define the user-object with its keys and values (just password and username) now I want to add more than that, but the stuff that I need is in the req, the problem is that in the stretegy, the req is not known
<ljharb>	kopasetik: that's an awful interview question
<falafel>	"do you know about this?" kind of questions are pointless
<falafel>	"show me how to solve this" is better
<doug16k>	kopasetik, hopefully people getting paid to do real front end work can answer most of those questions pretty easily
<falafel>	kakashiA1, not sure what you mean, maybe you can post an example?
<doug16k>	pen and paper interviews are crap imho. recorded screen computer interviews tell you a lot more
<falafel>	fizzbuzz, add(1)(2), are basic but good questions
<doug16k>	does he bang around fast and quickly edit the code, or is he pondering into space the whole time, crapping his pants
<rcyr>	It's crazy that a lot of people can't do fizzbuzz :/
<kakashiA1>	falafel: second
<falafel>	rcyr, http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/35mq2s/designer_applies_for_js_job_fails_at_fizzbuzz/
<falafel>	read that the other day
<rcyr>	I haven't read the article... but I'm not expecting much of a design in terms of programming
<rcyr>	Will read the article though
<falafel>	rcyr, it is basically about a person that applied to the wrong job, but there are some quotes that are hilarious, like "unless you’ve taken some abstract algebra recently, you will be totally loss."
<rcyr>	lol
<kakashiA1>	falafel: https://paste.xinu.at/wZ0w1/js
<doug16k>	is there an obfuscated javascript thing? js would be pretty good
<doug16k>	not really, it seems
<tehopeologist>	hey all with js regex how do i select the last result of the regex?
<rcyr>	doug16k: More or less, there's the js1k thing
<rcyr>	doug16k: http://js1k.com/
<falafel>	kakashiA1, ok, but where are foo and bar coming from?
<tehopeologist>	for example, if there's 2 /'s in the string i'm regexing, how do i start with the last one from the result
<tehopeologist>	?
<doug16k>	ah yeah, smallness competition would be popular for js
<doug16k>	if your script fits in one ethernet frame: win
<falafel>	tehopeologist, what exactly are you trying to do?
<tehopeologist>	get the name of a file in a filepath string
<tehopeologist>	don't want the ext, just the name of the file
<falafel>	tehopeologist, what is an example of input and output?
<kakashiA1>	falafel: from req.body
<tehopeologist>	input: asdf/qwer/core.lol  output: core
<falafel>	>>'path/to/file.js'.match(/\/?(\w+)\..+?$/)[1] @ tehopeologist
<ecmabot>	tehopeologist: (string) 'file'
<tehopeologist>	one sec lemme try it out
<falafel>	kakashiA1, I still don't get it... Where is req in that example you posted?
<kakashiA1>	falafel: thats the problem that I have
<kakashiA1>	because I am using strategies
<kakashiA1>	I dont know how to use req there
<falafel>	tehopeologist, note that assumes files contains only word characters, you may want to use `(.+?)` instead of `(\w+)`
<tehopeologist>	mkay
<falafel>	kakashiA1, what is "strategies"?
<tehopeologist>	got it, thanks!
<kakashiA1>	falafel: its an object, that is used by passport 90% of the time
<javascript100>	pfft
<falafel>	kakashiA1, sorry, I'm not familiar, maybe somebody else can help
<user_corrupt>	I have a jquery ui modal dialog window: http://pastie.org/10189817 which is loading some html content: http://pastie.org/10189819 which includes a text form on lines 50-53. What I am trying to do is use .val() to get the content of this text form when “ok!” is clicked (lines 17-19). Right now it is returning null.
<user_corrupt>	no longer returning null...
<Flynnn>	Is there a browser/plugin that has a developer mode that will keep track of all changes that JS makes to a webpage/all functions called within the JS engine?
<Flynnn>	(and then display said changes in a logfile)
<Flynnn>	(particularly next to which line executed the change)
<falafel>	Flynnn, developer tools? You put a brreakpoint and follow the callstack
<falafel>	!g developer tools manual @ Flynnn
<ecmabot>	Flynnn: Chrome DevTools Overview - Google Chrome <https://developer.chrome.com/devtools>
<Flynnn>	falafel: will a breakpoint let me watch for the creation of an element with a particular ID?
<falafel>	Flynnn, a breakpoint pauses your program, and you can step in and out of function calls a see what happens at each step
<Flynnn>	falafel: I'm trying to watch for changes in the DOM, not when a specific function gets called
<Flynnn>	falafel: and I have no idea how to put a breakpoint on the underlying DOM modification functions
<mpierce>	What would change the DOM if not a function?
<falafel>	Flynnn, you can add breakpoints to DOM elements
<Flynnn>	mpierce: I don't know which function is doing it xD
<falafel>	Flynnn, right click -> Break on -> Subtree Modifications
<Flynnn>	falafel: ooh!
<Flynnn>	falafel: thank you.
<Flynnn>	also, is there something that will show a stack-trace history -- basically a history of all functions that were called, and how the stack trace changed over time?
<Flynnn>	when functions returned to their caller, etc
<falafel>	Flynnn, console.trace, and the timeline
<Flynnn>	falafel: wait, the timeline will show function call history? what is console.trace?
<Flynnn>	falafel: console.trace() doesn't do a stack-trace history, it only does a single stack trace :(
*	h7r_ is now known as h7r
<falafel>	Flynnn, the timline shows you a callstack, grpahically
<falafel>	Flynnn, but not sure what you want to do
<Flynnn>	falafel: oh, wow, this is amazing, thank you. The chrome developer mode has come quite a long way since it broke off from safari...
<Flynnn>	Falafel: Is there a way to list all of the unique function names in this?
<falafel>	Flynnn, if the functions have names they will show up in the stack with that name, I don't think there is a way to programatically get all names
<Flynnn>	falafel: oh, I don't need them programatically -- just visually. But the problem is, when they are displayed in this graphical call stack, all of the names get cut off, and may be displayed more than once if they are called more than once
<falafel>	Flynnn, you can zoom in
<falafel>	to view more of the text
<Flynnn>	falafel: yes, but some are very small, and very sparse -- would be nice to have them as a list -- but I think I may have found one just now
<jsknoob>	hey
<jsknoob>	echo?
<Flynnn>	echo
<jsknoob>	Thanks Flynnn
<Flynnn>	np
<jsknoob>	So I am new to JS
<jsknoob>	How do I construct a json between a specific date range?
<falafel>	Flynnn, there used to be a list mode, I can't see it
<jsknoob>	I have managed to get the days in a flat array.
<jsknoob>	Let me show you
<falafel>	Flynnn, oh, in the profiler
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: eh? I don't think you construct a JSON between anything
<falafel>	Flynnn, select he "Tree" mode
<Flynnn>	"records" will appear on the lefthand side?
<jsknoob>	Flynnn: I mean a JSON that includes days between a date range. http://jsbin.com/rofakicome/1/
<jsknoob>	This is fine, but how do I put say, Days of Jan in a Jan, Feb in Feb and so forth.
<jsknoob>	Don't know how to construct the tree. I can code. I can't just get my head around it
<Flynnn>	that webpage appears to be blank
<Flynnn>	ah, never mind
<jsknoob>	Flynnn:  See your console or click on edit in jsbin
<Flynnn>	first off, in your own words, what is a JSON?
<jsknoob>	Flynnn:  Well, I will be using JSON.Stringfy, so I actually want a JavaScript Object here I assume?
<user_corrupt>	I have the following jquery UI modal dialog window running: http://pastie.org/10189855#10,17,43-45,57 Line 10 loads some html content which contains a text field, line 17 uses .val() to grab the value of that text field when “ok!” is selected (successful), line 57 calls a function that is supposed to pass the value of that text field when “ok!” is selected, but that fails. I realize that I need to restructure my code to have access to t
<user_corrupt>	cariable, but I don’t really know how to do it. Any suggestions?
<jsknoob>	Reason I said json is to clarify that I want a "static structure" instead of suggesting I just use the Date object.
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: JSON actually has not so much to do with JS. It's a standard format for sending data in text-form. And, I see
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: frankly I'm still not sure what you want to accomplish here, can you be a bit more specific?
<jsknoob>	Flynnn: I want { "Jan" : { 1,....,28} , "Feb
<jsknoob>	"{ "Jan" : { 1,....,28} , "Feb": {1,...30} ...... }" and so forth.
<jsknoob>	But I should be able to set the start and end point.
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: oh... well, that is complicated
<jsknoob>	I think I need to iterate through months first? or months->days, repeat.
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: not quite
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: here, I will show you
<jsknoob>	Hemmm.
<jsknoob>	Please do.
<Naresh>	HI @all
<Naresh>	Good Morning
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: you *should* use the date object, this is the best way to make sure you follow all date conventions. But, you can extract data from it differently
*	Naresh is now known as Guest5477
<jsknoob>	Flynnn: Yeah, that is what I did in my example too. But how do I walk it to create the "Plain Old" JS Object?
<Guest5477>	How to find the exact date before 3 months by current date ?
<abdulhannanali>	console.log("hello world")
<jsknoob>	Guest5477: today.setMonth(today.getMonth() - 3);
<falafel>	jsknoob, why not want `[{month: 'Jan', days: 31}, {month: 'Feb', days: 28}, ...]`. What are you trying to do? What is the goal?
<jsknoob>	falafel: first, delicious name. Second, I will be visualizing it with d3.js
<falafel>	jsknoob, I don't get what output you need exactly
<jsknoob>	falafel: Are you on *unix?
<falafel>	yes
<jsknoob>	*nix
<jsknoob>	`cal -y` think I want that in JSON.
<falafel>	so what is the JSON you expect?
<jsknoob>	But for specific date ranges.
<falafel>	can you give an example of input and output?
<jsknoob>	And array of array, or an object {"MNT" : [Array of Days]} should do.
<jsknoob>	Sure.
<ljharb>	is this one axis of a graph?
<ljharb>	what's the other axis?
<jsknoob>	!paste
<ecmabot>	jsknoob: Show some code, but don't paste it on the channel. You can provide a test case we can run and help you with your problem with http://jsfiddle.net , http://jsbin.com , or http://requirebin.com . Sites like http://gist.github.com/ and http://bpaste.net are cool too.
<s2013>	what are some advanced js topics y ou guys would say
<Flynnn>	jsknoop: is this collaborative, or do I need to send you a new copy?
<Flynnn>	jsknoob that is
<falafel>	s2013, what are you thinking of when you say "advance"?
<jsknoob>	Flynnn: I think you need to click "share" and it will give you a new one.
<s2013>	i dont know.. but if you applied as a senior js dev what things should you know but you probably wouldnt as a mid level dev

<abdulhannanali>	Hi
<abdulhannanali>	JS is cool
<jsknoob>	Flynnn: Thanks! That looks about it.
<jsknoob>	Not sure why includes 2016 though. Probably a <=/< issue.
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: a bit of warning, getDay() gives you the day of the week, not the day of the month
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: oh, yeah, that's strange
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: I think there might not be a 12th month
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: Yeah, there is no 12th month
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: months are 0-11, instead of 1-12
<jsknoob>	Oh, lovely. haha.
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: so 2015,12,31 actually equates to the first month of 2016 haha
<jsknoob>	Thanks heaps Flynnn
<Flynnn>	np -- let me double check the 0-11 thing online just to be sure
<Maxdamantus>	0–11 is how they should've been in the first place.
<Maxdamantus>	It's unfortunate that that's not how the days are.
<Maxdamantus>	or the year.
<jsknoob>	Flynnn: Well, the 1 is correct though
<jsknoob>	it is 28 days and that is Jan.
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: Jan does not have 28 days
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: feb does, I thought
<jsknoob>	Right.
<jsknoob>	My bad

<footer>	Hi
<Flynnn>	By using a date-string, you can use conventional 1-counting, instead of contending with the 0-counting of direct construction :)
<jsknoob>	I wonder how many bugs are there because of this.
<jsknoob>	Programming is fun
<footer>	Can anyone please tell me what am I doing wrong here ideone.com/5Rp2oR
<Maxdamantus>	1-counting sucks.
<Maxdamantus>	Just another Roman mistake.
<Havvy>	It is now July 0th.
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: potentially quite a few -- but yeah, this is why it's best to use the Date object directly as much as possible.
<Havvy>	The Romans didn't know of zero.
<Maxdamantus>	That's why they counted from 1.
<jsknoob>	huh?
<Maxdamantus>	or from I
<jsknoob>	I don't think counting from 0 is correct.
<Flynnn>	Maxdamantus: while I do not agree that counting from zero is necessarily "correct", I do agree that I dislike it
<jsknoob>	The 1 is the 1st.
<ljharb>	the way Date#getMonth works is quite sensible, at least.
<jsknoob>	So it makes prefect sense for it to be 1.
<footer>	Why when i do 3 in Object.keys({'3': 4}) i get false
<Maxdamantus>	jsknoob: which year of which century are we currently in?
<ljharb>	>> ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May'][new Date().getMonth()]
<ecmabot>	ljharb: (string) 'May'
<jsknoob>	Maxdamantus: We are in the 15th year of the 21 century.
<Maxdamantus>	jsknoob: how did you figure that out?
<jsknoob>	Maxdamantus: -_-
<jsknoob>	Maxdamantus: Do you have 11 fingers?
<Maxdamantus>	jsknoob: so what's the last year of the 21st century?
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: maxdamantus would argue that he has 9
<footer>	Anyone can look at my stupid query? :p
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: or that, he has a 9th finger and a 0th finger
<jsknoob>	If you count from "0" then how do you distinguish with "empty"?
<ljharb>	footer: because Object.keys returns an array.
<ljharb>	>> 3 in {3: 4} @ footer
<ecmabot>	footer: (boolean) true
<Flynnn>	The whole countign thing is arbitrary
<ljharb>	>> Object.keys({3: 4]).indexOf(3) > -1 @ footer
<ecmabot>	footer: SyntaxError: missing } after property list
<ljharb>	>> Object.keys({3: 4}).indexOf(3) > -1 @ footer
<ecmabot>	footer: (boolean) false
<Flynnn>	0-counting matches with the decimal representation of numbers
<jsknoob>	Anyone who has done static typed programming knows that an "empty" flag sucks.
<ljharb>	>> Object.keys({3: 4}).indexOf('3') > -1 @ footer
<ecmabot>	footer: (boolean) true
<Flynnn>	1-counting matches with the actual count of objects
<ljharb>	there
<Flynnn>	neither is explicitly wrong or correct
<Maxdamantus>	Flynnn: the decimal representation as opposed to the Roman numeral representation, perhaps.
<Flynnn>	-1-counting and 2-counting, and so forth are the only truly absurd ways to count
<footer>	Sorry accidently left
<Flynnn>	Maxdamantus: I don't know what you mean by that statement, sorry, can you clarify?
<footer>	I lost the logs :(
<jsknoob>	Maxdamantus: So if the "first" finger is the 0th finger. How do you represent no fingers with numbers?
<Maxdamantus>	0 was mostly introduced along with Arabic numerals.
<ljharb>	footer: because Object.keys returns an array.
<ljharb>	>> Object.keys({3: 4}).indexOf('3') > -1 @ footer
<ecmabot>	footer: (boolean) true
<ljharb>	>> 3 in {3: 4} @ footer
<ecmabot>	footer: (boolean) true
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: you are operating under the assumption that the total number of objects should be used in counting (thus the first object = 1)
<ljharb>	and "in" is for objects, not arrays.
<Maxdamantus>	The Romans used a silly numeral system without a representation for 0.
<Maxdamantus>	they could only write I, II, III, IV, V, VI, ..
<Flynnn>	Maxdamantus is arguing that if he looks at the hundreds place of the current year, he should be able to tell what century it is
<Maxdamantus>	they didn't have a way to write 0.
<Maxdamantus>	That's why 1 AD follows 1 BC
<jsknoob>	Flynnn: I am not. I am just saying that "0" being used as "Null"/"Empty" makes more sense than to use it as first.
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: not in computer science
<footer>	>>3 in {4:3}
<ecmabot>	footer: (boolean) false
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: in computer science, 0 makes counting much easier
<ljharb>	footer: basically you don't want to use "in".
<jsknoob>	Maxdamantus: I don't see your point. If there is 31 days in a month. The first one is 1, 0 means "no date".
<footer>	Hmm okay what if I want to check values then, ljharb?
<footer>	Is there such way?
<Maxdamantus>	jsknoob: why does 0 mean "no date"?
<Flynnn>	Jsknoob: 0 being null only makes sense if 1 represents the total number being "1" when you added the first object, and being "2" when you added the second. You are, actually, making that assump[tion
<ljharb>	footer: what exactly do you have and what do you want to check?
<Maxdamantus>	jsknoob: does the array index 0 mean "no index"?
<footer>	Ljharb, I am just playing in console
<ljharb>	footer: :-p come up with a real use case
<jsknoob>	Maxdamantus: Because 0 means "null"/"empty" So writing 2015/1/0 means that the year 2015, the first month, and a day that doesn't exist.
<footer>	And iterate over keys and value
<footer>	Ljharb, okay
<Flynnn>	Maxdamantus: Jsknoob: it is semantics. Both 0-counting and 1-counting are perfectly acceptable, and perfectly valid, depending upon your situation, and what information you value
<ljharb>	footer: Object.keys(foo).forEach(function (key) { foo[key] })
<Guest5477>	Hi i am getting the date in the format of dd/mm/yyyy(15/05/2015). So that i need to find the date before 3 months.How can i ?
<jsknoob>	Maxdamantus: No, it has to do with binary. It is to make most of how much we can count in a byte.
<ljharb>	Guest5477: use moment.js
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: 2015/1/0 could also be taken to mean that zero days have passed since 2015/1 -- thus it is the first day of 2015/1
<footer>	Ljharb aha and have to check against that, thanks
<jsknoob>	Flynnn: I don't think so. 0-count means there is no numeral way to represent empty and that sucks.
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: that is not true
<Flynnn>	jsknoob 0/0/0 would represent no time passed since the time we started counting
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: 1/1/1 currently represents no time passed.
<jsknoob>	Flynnn:  So, if you start with 0th finger to 9th. How do you write 0 fingers?
<ljharb>	0-counting means that 0 fingers is none.
<jsknoob>	Flynnn: Because 1/1/1:00:00:00 means not time passed.
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: minutes, hours, seconds are 0-counted, days, months, years are 1-counted. It is arbitrary]
<Maxdamantus>	0-counting means you can count 32 things on one hand instead of just 31.
<Havvy>	Centuries are 1-counted.
<Flynnn>	maxdamantus: that is not true
<Havvy>	Which is why as our years is 20xx, it's the 21st century. V.V
<Maxdamantus>	Flynnn: it is.
<Maxdamantus>	Havvy: that's not true.
<Maxdamantus>	Havvy: 2000 was the 20th century.
<Flynnn>	maxdamantus: 0-counting means 5 things can be counted with one hand. 1-counting means 6 things
<Maxdamantus>	Havvy: and 2100 is still the 21st century.
<jsknoob>	Flynnn: Actually not. A day starts the moment you start to count the first second, a month starts the moment the first day starts, and a year starts the moment the first month starts.
<Flynnn>	maxdamantus: but 1-counting means the hand has no representation for nothing
<Maxdamantus>	Flynnn: I'm thinking of binary counting.
<Maxdamantus>	Flynnn: why people should also learn to do.
<Flynnn>	Maxdamantus: oh
<Maxdamantus>	s/why/which/
<jsknoob>	Anyways
<jsknoob>	I am off to coding
<doug16k>	in IE11, http://jstraight.com/1254/16/show gets translate(30 20) from getAttribute('transform') !
<jsknoob>	thanks for the help Flynnn
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: before you go, may I advise you on something?
<doug16k>	is that allowed?
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: don't be so cold to 0-counting. And please reconsider your position on how it is incorrect. Both 0-counting and 1-counting are correct and incorrect in different situations
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: it would not make sense for a stopwatch to start at 1
<doug16k>	svg should have comma in transform="translate(30,20)", right?
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: just as it does not make sense for there to be a 0th place
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: they are situational, and depend on your needs at the time :)
<Flynnn>	Maxdamantus: same to you
<jsknoob>	Flynnn: The thing is, the stop watch counts seconds passed, the days of a month are sequential count. It is different.
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: that's exactly what I'm saying
<doug16k>	it seems to work with or without the comma, implying that the comma isn't supposed to be there
<Maxdamantus>	in case anyone's interested, Dijkstra started counting his pages and section numbers from 0 at some point.
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: but in computer science, it makes more sense to count from zero. 0 is the first value representable by an integer. 0-counting thus makes the memory operations for arrays much simpler
<doug16k>	found it: http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/coords.html#TransformAttribute   no comma
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: moreover, it makes partitioning way simpler. If we 1-counted, there would be fractal discontinuities at the head of arrays
<doug16k>	IE was forcing it to be valid
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: IE, it being 2015, but the 21st century
<jsknoob>	Flynnn: It doesn't make much sense but rather it is just convenient. I would say.
<Maxdamantus>	Once we start using these things for technical things, it becomes obvious that 0 is the right way.
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: both are one in the same
<Flynnn>	jsknoob: something only ever makes sense because it is convenient
<jsknoob>	Fair point.
<Maxdamantus>	astronomers have been converting between 0- and 1-based years for a while.
<jsknoob>	Try that with religion. God is "convenient" but doesn't make sense. :P
<jsknoob>	Oh my god. I need to stop now.
<Flynnn>	I am pretty sure this is a religion free channel
<Maxdamantus>	because it's kind of annoying having 2 BC, 1 BC, 1 AD, 2 AD, ..
<Maxdamantus>	nicer to have -1, 0, 1, 2
<Flynnn>	best not to declare one's religious beliefs as fact
<Maxdamantus>	because .. number theory makes sense.
<ankr>	well this is interresting.. good morning guys
<Flynnn>	howdy

<al80>	Wordpress is using some technique that I am not aware to refresh the same tab when you hit the preview button.
<al80>	how so they have implemented this feature?
<ljharb>	al80: target="some name"
<ljharb>	if they opened the named window, it will continue to update.
<al80>	but they are not opening a window...it's just a new tab of the  browser
<ljharb>	window and tab are synonyms as far as JS is concerned.
<al80>	ljharb: maybe you mean <a href="..." target="my page">...this a html solution. Is there a js one (something like window.open)?
<ljharb>	yes, the html solution is how wordpress does it
<ljharb>	and a non-JS solution is always preferred to a JS one

<Silent>	Hello :)
<Silent>	Is there a market for JS-based mobile apps?
*	itscassa|away is now known as itscassa
<Sharaal>	Silent: you mean if its a good idea to make them?
<Silent>	Sharaal: I would like to get into the market as a freelancer, and offer to develop PhoneGap applications. I would like to know if it's a good idea, or would I rather learn the native API
<funnycat>	https://vwo.com/blog/ab-test-proves-women-find-bearded-men-attractive/
<funnycat>	true ?
<Woet>	funnycat: it's true that it is entirely off-topic, yes.
<Antaranian>	hey
<forQuery>	i was trying to rewrite this with document.getElementById because it's inside a large loop
<forQuery>	var $tempParams = $("#params_" + i);
<forQuery>	var $tempParams = $(document.getElementById(" 'params_' + i "));
<forQuery>	it, it wont work
<Woet>	forQuery: why the double quotes?
<Woet>	forQuery: and why do you have to make this change "because it's inside a large loop"?
<forQuery>	var $tempParams = $(document.getElementById('params_' + i));
<forQuery>	cause this is faster
<Woet>	it isn't.
<forQuery>	and if you have to pull up 100 ids
<funnycat>	Woet: what if it was ontopic ?
<Woet>	forQuery: please share the benchmark you used to determine this.
<forQuery>	$('#id') vs $(document.getElementById('id'))
<forQuery>	the second one is 2x the speed
<Woet>	forQuery: please share the benchmark you used to determine this.
<Sharaal>	Silent: I think both makes sense. And if you have the knowledge about one of them, the other is not very much more
<Sharaal>	Silent: but I can say, games which need much animations are not good for a javascript mobile app :)
<Sharaal>	Silent: but normal apps with forms to put data on, some statistiks to display, so not graphic heavy things and if you want to rollout on much devices it makes for me defenitiv sense
<Silent>	Sharaal: Thanks
<forQuery>	woet
<forQuery>	get some!! http://imgur.com/YngxSMA
<Woet>	forQuery: please link the benchmark.
<forQuery>	http://jsperf.com/getelementbyid-vs-jquery-id/44
*	itscassa is now known as itscassa|away
<Woet>	forQuery: okay, so it's a difference of 0.03ms on your 100 ids
<Woet>	forQuery: I recommend you stop wasting your time with this micro-optimisation
<forQuery>	actually i have a huge dom
<ankr>	They all say that
<forQuery>	its more like .05ms    .1ms is noticable.  I wouldn't say im wasting time.
<Woet>	err, yea, you are.
<ankr>	.1ms ?
<Eppiox>	.1ms :D
<willv2>	That's interesting. I wonder why the bottom one is so much slower: http://jsperf.com/getelementbyid-vs-jquery-id/191
<Woet>	forQuery: if you looked at the benchmark you linked, you're only getting double the performance.
<Woet>	forQuery: if you just get rid of jQuery entirely you'd get a 16 time performance boost
<Woet>	forQuery: not sure why you're not doing that if these 10ths of microseconds are so important to you
<javascript748>	Hello, can you help me to unpack an array please ?
<javascript748>	I need to convert the values of an array into function's arguments :-)
<javascript748>	sooo I wrote this :
<javascript748>	this.fillHierarchy_And_SubData_Data.apply(this, [5,8]);
<javascript748>	which normally is equivalent to : this.fillHierarchy[...](5,8)
<javascript748>	but ONLY the 5 is passed.
<javascript748>	nothing about the 8.
<javascript748>	Can you explain me why pls ? :-)
<inimino>	javascript748: prove it
<javascript748>	inimino: prove it ?
<deltab>	looks fine to me
<inimino>	javascript748: prove the 8 is not being passed
<javascript748>	perhaps my function fillHierarchy is bugging and thus, it stops to the first arg
<javascript748>	but the console doesn't display an error :-(
<javascript748>	any error*
<deltab>	>> function fill(a, b) { console.log(a, b); }  fill.apply(this, [5, 8])
<ecmabot>	deltab: undefined; Console: 5, 8
<inimino>	that's a more likely hypothesis
<javascript748>	aaaaah no wait
<javascript748>	Wait
<javascript748>	!
<javascript748>	my function fill is :
<javascript748>	function fill(arguments)
<javascript748>	no function (fill arg1, arg2)
<javascript748>	because there is un infinite number of arguments !
<javascript748>	is an*
<ankr>	javascript748 "arguments" is a magic property
<javascript748>	so maybe it's because of that i encounter this bug.
<ankr>	Do not define it yourself
<javascript748>	are you sure ? because in the MDN guide it's wrote
<inimino>	yes
<javascript748>	Hmmmmm okay
<deltab>	javascript748: do you mean just that your function has a single parameter?
<javascript748>	I'll try :-)
<javascript748>	yes
<deltab>	or that it's named 'arguments'?
<javascript748>	deltab: yes
<javascript748>	but
<javascript748>	hmmmm
<deltab>	don't name it 'arguments'
<javascript748>	no listen ^^
<javascript748>	my function has an infinite nuber of args
<javascript748>	i don't know why iwrote fill(arguments) instead of "fill()" xD
<deltab>	so have a single parameter that takes an array
<javascript748>	hmm
<javascript748>	ok:=)
<javascript748>	nope
<javascript748>	not an array
<inimino>	it doesn't make any difference, apply() still works
<javascript748>	I really need to pass an infinite number of values :)
<inimino>	your bug is elsewhere
<inimino>	you mean "indefinite" or "infinite"?
<javascript748>	infinite
<javascript748>	1,2,3,4,5,6,78....
<javascript748>	^^
<inimino>	well, that is literally impossible
<javascript748>	ah no
<javascript748>	no
<javascript748>	no
<javascript748>	no sorry
<javascript748>	xD
<javascript748>	it's really a parameter
<javascript748>	i will rename it x)
<inimino>	good luck...
<javascript748>	tx:)
<javascript748>	I know why it's bugging
<javascript748>	hmm
<javascript748>	do you know if "arguments", inside a function's block, is an object ?
<javascript748>	or an array ?
<javascript748>	or if it's impossible to reproduce ?
<ankr>	javascript748 it's an "array like" object
<javascript748>	okay
<inimino>	!mdn arguments
<ecmabot>	inimino: Arguments object - JavaScript | MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments>

<abishek>	is there a way to queue functions in javascript so that intensive calls can be added and executed one after the other?
<jspdown>	Yes of course. Create an array and push manualy each functions inside. After you can unqueue when you want, as many as you want
<jspdown>	an example here: https://jsfiddle.net/dzs3qf2h/
<robtheballonguy>	How can I get the date for same day next week?
<jspdown>	If you are using a lot dates in your project, you should consider using moment.js. It provide a nice API for that kind of operation.

<tumulte>	is there a simpler alternative to math round(4.41515*100)/100
<tumulte>	cause it's both very intelligent and completly stupid
<Eppiox>	tumulte for what purpose?
<tumulte>	to round to n decimals
<tumulte>	like any other round from any other langauges
<tumulte>	that have a precision variable
<deltab>	tumulte: if you're converting to a string, use x.toFixed(n)
<Eppiox>	you could check the n+1 decimal value and manually round n given if it's >=5 perhaps. but i'm a find of the stupid way if it works
<deltab>	>> 3.31414.toFixed(2)
<ecmabot>	deltab: (string) '3.31'
<Eppiox>	but they would need to round the number still
<Maxdamantus>	>> 3.349999999.toFixed(2);
<ecmabot>	Maxdamantus: (string) '3.35'
<Eppiox>	ah or not :D
<Eppiox>	parseFloat(3.349999999.toFixed(2));
<Eppiox>	maybe something like that..
<Maxdamantus>	You should question why you're rounding such numbers though.
<tumulte>	Maxdamantus: maybe because foating point precision is a PITA in JS
<Eppiox>	>> parseFloat(3.349999999.toFixed(2));
<ecmabot>	Eppiox: (number) 3.35
<Maxdamantus>	tumulte: it does what it's meant to do.
<Maxdamantus>	tumulte: don't use it for what it's not meant to do.
<Maxdamantus>	tumulte: it's not unique to JS.
<Eppiox>	OR use it for what it's not meant to do, get it to work how you want it to then complain :D
<bittyx>	Hiya. I'm having trouble with performance when doing a parallax effect with images. I'm not sure if there is a better channel to ask about profiling and optimizing this. I have 6 sections on one page, each having 2 full-HD images moving horizontally while scrolling. Sometimes the images flicker, and I'm trying to debug this. I've done some profiling with Chrome's timeline, and the longest operation is always an "Image decode" event, which takes a
<bittyx>	nywhere from 50-200ms.
<tumulte>	Maxdamantus: I don't follow you here
*	KungFuChao is now known as ChaozHenchman
<Maxdamantus>	tumulte: you haven't explained why you want to round fractional values.
<bittyx>	The thing is that image decodes happen multiple times for a single image, for example when I open the page, the initially visible images are decoded; after I scroll to the bottom, and then back to the top, they get decoded again.
<bittyx>	Is this some garbage collection weirdness, or am I doing something wrong?
<Maxdamantus>	tumulte: it's likely that if you are rounding them, you're using them wrong.
<Eppiox>	could you decode the image and attach it to the dom somehow?
<Maxdamantus>	tumulte: eg, if you're trying to denote discrete things like currency, use integers to count some common denominator, not fractional values.
<tumulte>	Maxdamantus: cause I'd like to display a human readable result of the average
<Havvy>	tumulte:  Parse it back into human readable at the end.
<Maxdamantus>	tumulte: so you're trying to convert it into a string? .toFixed.
<Eppiox>	Maxdamantus read up about 2 pages to where he first posted, someone else said toFixed
<Maxdamantus>	Eppiox: yes, but he never mentioned he wanted a string.
<Eppiox>	that was deltab :)
<bittyx>	Eppiox: I have no idea how to decode the image, isn't this something internal to the browser?
<willv2>	bittyx: Have you tried it without your cache disabled? (I assume you're developing with no cache)
<bittyx>	willv2: Yup, tried it and it's still buggy. Actually, on my development laptop it's not so noticeable unless you scroll really fast, but the client's browser is really bad (Chrome on a really good iMac configuration).
<bittyx>	I understand large image operations are generally expensive, and aren't expected to work great on low-end machines, but the client's iMac is better than my dev laptop, and the website works awful for them, but okay for me.
<bittyx>	So since it doesn't seem to be a hardware-related issue, thus I'm trying to figure out where the performance is low.
<willv2>	bittyx: Hmm, sites with gigantic images always dragged my old iMac to it's knees. Maybe chrome doesn't have good hardware accell on some osx machines.
<hipsterslapfight>	chrome was never 64bit on mac
<hipsterslapfight>	iirc it is now though
<ksmth>	yup, it is
<bittyx>	That's the thing, it seems to be sort of random. The client's really awesome iMac setup (with 32GB RAM and a 4GB graphics card) flickers heavily in Chrome, and performs a little better in Firefox in Safari. They've also tested Win7 laptops with intel i7 processors and 8GB of RAM and report problems. However, my laptop is an i7 and 8GB of RAM and it works okay in Chrome and awesome on Firefox in Ubuntu. I've also had access to some slower Win7 lap
<bittyx>	tops with 4GB of RAM where it works acceptably in all browsers.
<hipsterslapfight>	try to get the repaints down
<hipsterslapfight>	go turn on the paint rectangles and see if there's anything you're painting when you shouldn't be
<dostoyevsky>	is there a way to lock certain elements?  like when you show another dialog and want to disable scrolling for certain elements in the background
<bittyx>	hipsterslapfight: That's the thing, these are background images moving left-right, so basically everything needs to be repainted.
<hipsterslapfight>	set overflow to hidden?
<hipsterslapfight>	bittyx: ahh, well in that case you're pretty much screwed
<robtheballonguy>	Anyone know much about d3? Why this doesn't even draw? http://jsbin.com/wotabuvanu/1/edit?js,console,output ?
<bittyx>	:/
*	lite is now known as lite_
<bittyx>	I'm just trying to figure out the problem because in my testing it works okay even on lower-end configurations, so obviously it can be handled by the browser and hardware. I'm just not sure why it doesn't work on higher-end configurations as tested by the client.
<robtheballonguy>	bittyx: There is no lower or higher end per se.
<robtheballonguy>	And web is not always backwards compatible.

<quetzakubica>	I don't see benefits of immutability in js.
<zomg>	I can give you an example where we had problems with that in our angularjs app
<quetzakubica>	I would appreciate it
<zomg>	we share a certain set of objects in the app and they're displayed and used in a number of parts of the UI
<zomg>	different parts may do a bit different things with them
<ksmth>	well, I don't know, but maybe objgrep is for you
<zomg>	one part was storing some helper values in the objects to assist in whatever it was doing
<ksmth>	Industrial: https://github.com/begriffs/objgrep
<zomg>	these values were supposed to be "private" to this piece of code
<duhl>	!mdn undefined
<ecmabot>	duhl: undefined - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined>
<zomg>	but because objects are references, of course these values would show up in other places as well
<zomg>	so eventually someone thought these helper values should actually belong to these objects and started using these values in another location of the code
<Industrial>	ksmth: ty!
<zomg>	which would then cause problems because not all objects would have those values
<zomg>	we also had an issue where these values ended up in the database because they were being saved from this code into mongodb
<quetzakubica>	zomg: I think it's modelling problem

<epichero>	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14389514/getjson-doesnt-work-correctly-the-first-time-the-script-runs-but-it-does-t
<epichero>	console.log + async code can confuse
<s2013>	epichero yeah but i have it the correct way.. my codes inside the callback
<s2013>	hmm
<s2013>	it seems to have worked after i removed JSON.stringify
<s2013>	weird
<s2013>	well wahtever
<s2013>	thanks
<MacWinner>	are sites like ghostrec.com or inspectlet.com using javascript to send the entire dom structure back to their servers?  I'm amazed by how high the fidelity is of their recording and playback with simple javascript
<falafel>	s2013, weird? does vectorMap expect JSON or not?
<s2013>	it does.. i dont know.. it works but now i gotta figure out he main thing. on how to get it working with react
<Sorella>	jaawerth: we use it for a bunch of things at work :3
<epichero>	Any opinions on Famo.us?
<Sorella>	epichero: clearly not famous enough (never heard of it)
<Torkable>	(❍ᴥ❍ʋ)
<epichero>	Sorella: but it's famo.us!
<falafel>	heard of it but haven't used it
<falafel>	is it a framework of some sort?
<falafel>	"Famo.us is a free, open source JavaScript framework that helps you create smooth, complex UIs for any screen."
<epichero>	it addresses the same problem as flipbook does http://engineering.flipboard.com/2015/02/mobile-web/ here
<falafel>	so building a website with canvas basically?
<emaczen>	for some reason, it appears that setAttribute is not setting the attribute of an SVGCircleElement
<emaczen>	my code looks like: el.setAttribute('cy', 20);
<epichero>	that's what it boils down to it seems i'm just delving into it right now
<emaczen>	can anybody help me with this?
<bewl>	emaczen: maybe? post some code so we can see it in context
<emaczen>	var el = document.createElementNS('http://www.w3.org/2000/svg', 'circle');
<emaczen>	then neither el.cx = 20 nor el.setAttribute('cx', 20) works
<emaczen>	In the REPL if I type el.cx or el['cx'] it returns {}
<emaczen>	bewl: Is that helpful?
<theseb>	what does this mean in a link?.. href    = "javascript:void(0)"
*	oddskill is now known as oddskill_away
*	boltR_ is now known as boltR
<jaawerth>	Sorella: as you release libraries you should give the most useful ones increasingly scandalous names
<bewl>	emaczen: what is 'el' returning?
<emaczen>	[object SVGCircleElement]
<jaawerth>	dev'll be all like "this module will make my job easier but if I install it into the the project I could lose my job!"
<emaczen>	bewl: So the initial statement works
<bewl>	i just quickly tested everything you gave me in my chrome dev console
<bewl>	and it works fine
<jaawerth>	(not that polygamous is particularly bad but it is pretty funny)
<emaczen>	I'm using FF if that matters...
<jaawerth>	Sorella: maybe you could name a future lib "no-seriously-fuck-you"
<bewl>	works in FF too
*	robotmayo is now known as zz_robotmayo
<cjohnson>	!doesn't work @ emaczen
<ecmabot>	emaczen: What do you mean it doesn't work? Is it unemployed? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? What did you want or expect to happen?
*	zz_robotmayo is now known as robotmayo
<epichero>	i'm underemployed does that count
<bewl>	not sure what other problems you are having
<emaczen>	bewl: If you type el.cx it prints 20 to the console?
<bewl>	but i can say that the specific things you are saying dont work here, are in fact working fine by themselves
<bewl>	no it returns an SVGAnimatedLength object
<jaawerth>	it isn't unemployed, it's independently wealthy THANK YOU VERY MUCH
<bewl>	el.cx.baseVal.value
*	oddskill_away is now known as oddskill
<emaczen>	bewl: What is baseVal and animVal?
<bewl>	not sure :)
<bprompt>	heheh jaawerth
<emaczen>	I guess I'll have to read more into the SVG apis but yeah, it will return 20 if I do el.baseVal.value...
<emaczen>	But still {} if I evaluate el.cx
<bewl>	its not doing that for me
<bewl>	it looks like you may be changing the value of el.cx somewhere?
<emaczen>	bewl: It's just the REPL I am using
<emaczen>	I tried it out in FF web console and I got the same thing you did
<emaczen>	bewl: Thanks!
<bprompt>	emaczen:    try maybe with var attr = el.setAttributeNode("cx");  attr.value = 20;
<bprompt>	emaczen:    there's a setAttrbuteNS() also, takes 3 arguments, namespace uri, attribute name and value
<bewl>	emaczen: np
<cjohnson>	what would be the easiest way to find/replace all array(XXX) with [] in PHP?
<cjohnson>	I don't want to just do a regex because any number of things could exist between array( and )

<bewl>	*coughcough*asp.net*coughcough*
<epichero>	how has asp not gone the way of vbscript
<bewl>	eh?
<deltab>	cjohnson: in short, yes
<bprompt>	epichero:   technically, asp.net is just templating using vbs more or less
<bewl>	im confused here...
<bewl>	you talking about Razor?
<epichero>	I haven't dabbled in asp for over a decade. the only .net languages I've dabbled in are F# a bit, and C# playing around with unity
<cjohnson>	I'm not trying to change any code at all. but PHP until recently did not support ['a']
<cjohnson>	only array('a')
<cjohnson>	so my codebase is fll of array() and they're unsightly and make it hard to tell the diff between array end and func end. So I just want to swap them all at once
<bewl>	epichero: i has changed QUITE a bit since then, I can assure you :)

<jrkie>	looking for a useragent string to always detect firefox on windows (not linux) like: if (navigator.userAgent.indexOf('MSIE') !== -1 || navigator.appVersion.indexOf('Trident/') > 0) { will always return msie windows on windows
<kevireilly_>	Hey there. I've been exploring potential ways to speed up the perceived load time and overall performance of a web application and was curious if anyone had any additional general ideas or concepts to explore. So far I'm thinking: gzip, reduce network requests (minification, concatenate more files, use image sprites), reduce code complexity and CSS selectors, reduce requirements to enter application down to what you can see, general
<kevireilly_>	less is more
<kevireilly_>	Worth noting that there is a loading screen concept and that the target platform is not modern computers or browsers
<tejasmanohar>	i have some quick node, express, socket.io work- will take just a couple hours and it's a fork of another open-source project, https://github.com/weblancaster/instagram-real-time. if anyone's interested, just ping me on freenode. busy with some other work tonight
<Torkable>	so what is the target platform
<tejasmanohar>	*(paid) contract work and deadline is in the next 12 ish hours
<cjohnson>	jrkie: useragent is easily spoofed and generally they all lie so much that attempts to parse it are often wrong
<cjohnson>	what do you need to detect it for?
<kevireilly_>	Torkable: relatively common, relatively specialized. WebKit.
<cjohnson>	if you want to know if a browser has a given feature, just test for that feature. browsers change over time so even just checking "is firefox" is a bad test
<tejasmanohar>	the app can be open-source as well btw
<Torkable>	go away
<cjohnson>	lol
<kevireilly_>	Not sure who that was directed at, but I'd be specific if I could. Any general applicable concepts welcome.
<Torkable>	not you lol
<kevireilly_>	*generally
<cjohnson>	kevireilly_: pagespeed extension
<bprompt>	maybe it was his evil twin =)
<cjohnson>	get that, and follow all the advice
<kevireilly_>	cjohnson: I'll check that out, thanks
<cjohnson>	minify and concat all your CSS and JS into one file each. Use sprites if you have a mountain of images (and/or conver to CSS where applicable)
<kevireilly_>	yup yup, I already see the need for that
<cjohnson>	CSS selectors are probably not that big of a deal as far as complexity
<cjohnson>	those things will make the biggest impact
<kevireilly_>	I suppose that was more rendering
<cjohnson>	CSS is rarely the slow piece in rendering
<cjohnson>	it's using JS-based rendering that slows it all down
<cjohnson>	even a moutain of CSS won't really be noticeable
<kevireilly_>	For sure. Been working on that also and it's been a blast haha
<cjohnson>	:P
<kevireilly_>	Ah I guess that was based on research on reflows/repaints
<cjohnson>	yeah
<cjohnson>	use css3 transitions for as much animation as you can
<cjohnson>	overall sounds like you're on the right path
<cjohnson>	pagespeed should get you the rest of the way there
<kevireilly_>	Excellent. The feedback is much appreciated.
<austincheney>	is this dumb https://github.com/prettydiff/Array.prototype.last
<Torkable>	you know about shift and unshift, right?
<austincheney>	unshift is for the first index
<austincheney>	i dont remember shift
<Torkable>	err yea, sorry, pop
<Torkable>	push pop shift unshift
<falafel>	I don't think returning `null` is ideal
<austincheney>	shift adds a new index at the front of the array and unshift removes the first index
<austincheney>	not the same thing
<austincheney>	falafel: what should be a good default value and type?
<austincheney>	undefined?
<falafel>	austincheney, the default behavior, `undefined`
<falafel>	yes
<austincheney>	np
<bewl>	unshift adds to the first index of the array
<bewl>	shift removes
<bewl>	but shift also returns to you the element it removed
<austincheney>	changed
<Torkable>	oh so this would just return the value
<Torkable>	gotcha
<austincheney>	what if I dont want to remove anything?
<Torkable>	yea
<jrkie>	just need a true to return if the browser is firefox on windows, this block will execute also with firefox on linux: if (navigator.appVersion.indexOf("Win")!=-1 || navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().indexOf('firefox') > -1) { dunno why
<bewl>	for what action?
<jrkie>	what i need else
<falafel>	jrkie, why do you need to detect it?
<bewl>	austincheney: what are you trying to do?
<yansanmo>	jrkie,  it's a "or"
<yansanmo>	it should be a "and"
<jrkie>	i already did AND i believe
<jrkie>	if (navigator.appVersion.indexOf("Win")!=-1 AND navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().indexOf('firefox') > -1) { you mean
<yansanmo>	AND in javascript is  &&
<austincheney>	bewl: read the last index of an array
<jrkie>	yeah
<jrkie>	stupid
<jrkie>	hehe
<austincheney>	bewl: i get tired or writing things like   if (token[token.length - 1] === "<")    or worse still  if (token[token.length - 1].indexOf(ref) > ref.length - 1)
<bewl>	ah
<falafel>	austincheney, that second code is not safe, if there is no last item, then you get "undefined is not a function"
<bewl>	well if the array is empty
<bewl>	which i would hope is being checked before that
<austincheney>	of course it is never really that easy, because you pass this into a method and the array is empty then things break       myStr.indexOf(myArray[myArray.length - 1]); // epic fail if myArray.length === 0
<austincheney>	falafel: agreed
<bewl>	you could throw a function on the array prototype to do that for you
<bewl>	if you are constantly writing it
<falafel>	ideally last would return a maybe, I'd say if there is no last element it should throw an error, but `undefined` is better than `null`
<austincheney>	bewl: that is what the example code in the readme does
<bewl>	yea i see it now, that would solve you problems, and it isnt stupid :P
<cjohnson>	I don't disagree with the method but doesn't seem like it really belongs in the ES spec
<bewl>	it doesnt really
<austincheney>	falafel: it does not need to throw an error if undefined is returned, because undefined will still break something else down the line only if something else down the line consumes this directly, otherwise no error
<cjohnson>	performance concerns at this level are a waste of time
<bewl>	its not hard to add it to the prototype yourself
<cjohnson>	well I wouldn't do that either
<bewl>	if you need it
<cjohnson>	function last(arr){...}
<bewl>	sure
<falafel>	austincheney, well, that's the default JS behavior, so it is fine I suppose. What I'm saying is that if there was a builtin optional type, then you'd have last : [a] -> Maybe a
<cjohnson>	Maybe does sound great
<austincheney>	cjohnson: not necessarily, it depends on the size of the data and what you are doing with it, something like ASM.js would certainly benefit from this
<cjohnson>	the size of the data is irrelevant
<cjohnson>	reading its .length property is basically negligible
<bewl>	but not ALL arrays would benefit from it
<cjohnson>	and the time to look it up from the native prototype vs just calling a function is equally negligible
<bewl>	which is the case for why it would be better to just make a function call to do it for you
<cjohnson>	falafel how does maybe look in code. if I call foo() and it returns Maybe a
<cjohnson>	does everything all the way up the chain have to support Maybe?
<bprompt>	 <austincheney> bewl: i get tired or writing things like   if (token[token. ....
<bprompt>	makes sense, if the usage is often, just like makes sense for a lib like jquery to use $() for document.querySelector() if used often as well
<falafel>	cjohnson, foo().chain(console.log) // nothing will happen if foo() returns Nothing
*	meandi_1 is now known as meandi
<bprompt>	thus the use of classes and inheritance
<cjohnson>	so Maybe provide a .chain method basically?
<falafel>	cjohnson, yeah, all monads must provide at least a .chain and a constructor
<cjohnson>	oh ok
<MrPunkin>	Hey folks. I’m triggering a form submisison (non ajax) via javascript that returns a file download (so no redirect away from the page) and I’m just curious if there are any events I can use so that my javascript is aware of when the form gets a response back from the server?
<cjohnson>	if you're letting the browser handle the form submission, that is a new page request
<cjohnson>	so I doubt javascript will be able to interact with the new request in any way
<bewl>	sounds like you actually want ajax
<cjohnson>	yeah it does
<MrPunkin>	you can’t download files with ajax
<cjohnson>	you get one or the other -- browser-managed download, or javascript-managed form
<cjohnson>	if the browser is managing it, js can't
<MrPunkin>	That’s kind of what I was trying to ask, just if there was any-way to
<MrPunkin>	apparentlyn ot
<falafel>	cjohnson, something like that http://jsfiddle.net/9gofdf94/. But now you are "trapped" in the monad for other things, this is useful if you use Maybe from the start of your project, otherwise it can be cumbersome
<MrPunkin>	if you know of a way to get a download via JS though I’m all ears
<MrPunkin>	download a JPEG file to the users computer, that is.
<cjohnson>	MrPunkin: nothing really
<cjohnson>	best bet is html5 <a download> attr
<cjohnson>	but not all browsers will let you trigger it
<cjohnson>	via js
<cjohnson>	header content-disposition: attachment is just about the only good way to reliably download still
<MrPunkin>	well even then it’d just do what my form does, right?
<MrPunkin>	it wouldn’t be aware of how long it takes or anything
<MrPunkin>	no way to tie in to when the request is finished
<cjohnson>	what's the .of for falafel?
<cjohnson>	right MrPunkin
<MrPunkin>	thanks for the help. Figured as much, but thought I’d ask to be sure.
<Thorn__>	hello
<foofin>	Hello!
<Thorn__>	is it possible to require a webpack module from the browser console for testing? webpack docs imply you can't do that
<cjohnson>	If they imply you can't... why would you assume you can? ;)
<falafel>	cjohnson, oh, that's just the way to construct a Maybe out of a value, which is Just, that's the requirement on the monad interface, you need "chain" and "of", with those you can check the monad laws, of associativity, and identity
<falafel>	or "bind" and "return" in Haskell
<falafel>	but those have overloaded meanings in JS already
<cjohnson>	oh ok. I still don't really get what a monad is
<Torkable>	you don't have to
<Torkable>	just understand how to use them
<Torkable>	and you'll be fine
<Torkable>	and happier lol
<cjohnson>	yes that's what I said
<cjohnson>	I don't understand them thus I don't understand how to use them
<cjohnson>	:P
<Torkable>	na
<Torkable>	using them is pretty easy
<cjohnson>	that's not what I said
<cjohnson>	I just said I don't understand how to us them
<cjohnson>	I haven't spent much time... I'm sure it's an easy concept once you already get it :P
<Torkable>	you use maybe or either?
<falafel>	cjohnson, that's what it is, that interface is a monad, if you can implement "chain" and "of", and "m.of(a).chain(f) === f(a)" and "m.chain(m.of) === m", then you got a monad
<cjohnson>	of is input, chain is output?
<cjohnson>	it moves data through
<cjohnson>	ok
<jaawerth>	chain is one form of passing, yeah
<cjohnson>	the monad holds a bit of data that you can move through a and f
<jaawerth>	(the main form, I guess)
<cjohnson>	or I dunno
<Torkable>	its like a box
<falafel>	I guess the "when you know what a monad is you lose the ability to explain it" is true, I can't explain it any better
<Torkable>	you can open
<Torkable>	and close again before passing it along
<jaawerth>	you don't necessarily know what's in the box, but that doesn't stop you from pushing buttons to make it do things
<cjohnson>	lol
<Torkable>	:P
<Sorella>	cjohnson: the thing is that "what a monad is" isn't really important :) It's a pretty abstract concept, unlike e.g.: "Iterator", even though both are just interfaces
<jaawerth>	and then you open it an an error pops out, but the error has been transformed by all those ops you were doing in surprising and horrifying ways
<Torkable>	that's what I was trying to say lol
<MrPunkin>	Okay, odd question though. It appears jQuery is aware of when the form request finishes. I get this line in my console: http://cl.ly/ayhk
<cjohnson>	Sorella: see the line about "I do not understand it so I do not understand how to use it"
<MrPunkin>	Despite it not being an AJAX request
<cjohnson>	none of these analogies or examples are making anything click for me
<cjohnson>	it's gibberish
*	jaawerth realizes he let having just watched The Babadook seep into his description of monads
<Torkable>	:\
<Sorella>	cjohnson: it's mostly used for sequencing operations. But can also be used for combining things.
<jaawerth>	that movie gets into your head!
<jaawerth>	cjohnson: just start messing around with them
<cjohnson>	I can't, I have no idea how they work
<cjohnson>	lol
<jaawerth>	push buttons until stuff starts to beep!
<cjohnson>	I've looked at examples but they're usuually too high level
<falafel>	cjohnson, it is not "high level" but "abstract"
<Torkable>	I know you don't believe it, but I cannot stress enough that you don't need to understand what they are to use them
<Torkable>	same with arrows
<cjohnson>	whatever your choice of word
<Torkable>	and many other abstract stuff like that
<cjohnson>	Torkable: if that were the case, I would be able to use them
<Sorella>	`[1, 2, 3].flatMap(function(a){ return [a - 0.5, a, a + 0.5] }) => [0.5, 1, 1.5, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 2.5, 3, 3.5]` is an example of using them for combining results. `readFile().then(console.log)` is an example of using them for sequencing operations
<cjohnson>	Unless you're talking about use them as in as a library user
<Torkable>	if you use bind on maybe, you're using monads
<natmyers1>	so wait, what's the difference between a monad and a plain old variable?
<Sorella>	Unlike iterator, there isn't a single way of "implementing a monad." So you don't need to "know how to use monads," you just need to "know how to sequence promises", "know how to combine array transformations", etc.
<Torkable>	(*) <$> Just 2 <*> Just 8
<Torkable>	= 16
<Sorella>	That's applicative tho
<cjohnson>	Sorella: what is of in the promise example
<Torkable>	it just says pull the values out of the boxes and multiply them
<falafel>	cjohnson, Promise.of === Promise.resolve
<Torkable>	o wait
<Torkable>	lol
<Sorella>	cjohnson: `Promise.of(1).then(function(a){ return Promise.of(a + 1) })`
<cjohnson>	you're using the word in the defintiion
<cjohnson>	lol
<cjohnson>	falafel that makes sense
<cjohnson>	so yeah of is the function that you put the data into
<cjohnson>	and chain is the function that it comes out of
<Sorella>	Promise.of can be anything. It just creates a value that when you `.chain(identity)` you get that value back
<Torkable>	Just 9 >>= \x -> return (x*10)
<Torkable>	= 90
<falafel>	cjohnson, a continuation is a monad for example, you have `chain` which sequences callbacks, and you have `of` to create a new continuation
<jaawerth>	just think of them as dyslexic nomads
<Torkable>	I don't have to understand the theory behind >>= to use it
<falafel>	cjohnson, that is the building block of Promises
<jaawerth>	and like nomads, they really just walk in circles
<falafel>	cjohnson, Promises add error handling and state to a continuation monad
<Sorella>	cjohnson: the nice thing about monads is that they can literally be anything, there isn't necessarily a common pattern that they all must follow. In fact `Array.of(1).chain(f)` can do completely different things.
<cjohnson>	so when you say Promise.of === Promise.resolve you're not implying that the function literally be called .of right
<cjohnson>	just that it behave in the way that your "of" archtype behaves
<cjohnson>	?
<Sorella>	Which is why it doesn't make sense to bother trying to think about what promises are :P
<falafel>	cjohnson, yes, that's what I mean, in Promises A, `of` is `resolve`.
<cjohnson>	ok that makes more sense then
<Sorella>	s/promises/monads/
<Sorella>	Though that goes for basically everything in abstract algebra and category theory. There's literally nothing that tells you what `+`, `bind`, `join`, `chain`, `*`, etc. do. They could do anything. And in fact, there's usually at least 10 different ways of implementing a monad or monoid for a data structure
<jaawerth>	I don't know if that's necessarily a good thing
<jaawerth>	:P
<Sorella>	(10 completely different ways*)
<Sorella>	jaawerth: I was joking :P
<kevireilly>	cjohnson: seems like the pagespeed insights chrome extension has been deprecated in favor of an online service. Is this the same one you were referring to or were you picturing something for firefox or otherwise?
<jaawerth>	lol sorry my rational mind has evaporated due to lack of sleep and I'm sort of floating along in a warm mist of consciousness
<Sorella>	It's nice that you can reuse a lot of code. But saying "X is a monad" only tells you "X has a method called 'chain' and a method called 'of'," which is not helpful at all if you want to know WHAT those things do
<Torkable>	right, totally depends on what the type is
<cjohnson>	damn, really? I just installed it not long ago kevireilly. the online version is mostly the same I guess just not as convenient for developing locally
<Torkable>	I spent a long time trying to figure out wtf an arrow is, because of this stupid tutorial I read on web scraping in haskell
<Torkable>	and it said, "you should understand what arrows are"
<Torkable>	and they're confusing as hell and you don't need to understand them at all to use the library
<kevireilly>	cjohnson: ah gotcha. Wonder if there is some cached version somewhere or something. It is feasible to get it online, just not preferable
<jaawerth>	when it comes to parsing haskell stuff I've taken to just assuming my first thought is right until I learn otherwise, haha
<Torkable>	lolk
<Torkable>	just trust the types
<Sorella>	Like if you say "Number is an abelian group". I can't tell you if `a (+) b` does addition or multiplication, or exponentiation, or (...)
<kokut>	Hello, anyone knows how to remove breakpoints in chrome? they keep coming up even after restarting the computer, wtf?
<cjohnson>	Torkable: fwiw, I definitely was not asking "how do I use something that is a monad". I was asking to understand how they actually work so I could use tham as a concept. in my own code
<Torkable>	fair enough
<jaawerth>	they're kind of mcguffins
<Torkable>	everyone does the same thing though
<kevireilly>	kokut: open dev tools, go to the Sources tab, and uncheck them in the right column under Breakpoints OR just click [ / > deactivate breakpoints button in the top right
<kokut>	kevireilly: i already done that man
<Torkable>	and everyone in #haskell will tell you the same thing, just dive in and start using em, and it'l click
<jaawerth>	cjohnson: have you looked at the code for them in Sorella's libs yet?
<kevireilly>	kokut: and you’re sure the code doesn’t have debugger statements in them?
<kokut>	kevireilly: yea i'm sure
<cjohnson>	Torkable: there was nothing to dive into
<cjohnson>	since I had no idea how to write one, all I could do was make use of somebody else's api
<cjohnson>	which definitely wasn't clicking anything
<cjohnson>	Trust me I think I get how my brain works lol
<aeschylus>	I am trying to track user behaviour for a psychological study. Is there an extension or framework for monitoring and analysing user traffic that WORKS ENTIRELY IN THE BROWSER WITHOUT NEEDING TO CONTROL THE PAGE?
<Sorella>	cjohnson: interface Monad<A>{ chain: (A -> Monad<B>) -> Monad<B>, of: B -> Monad<B> }, such that m.of(a).chain(f) = f(a) && m.chain(m.of) = m.chain(f).chain(g) = m.chain(f . g). "But how do I figure out that something is a Monad so I can implement it?" Category Theory doesn't tell you :D
<Dustin|Work>	Hey Guys, Can anyone help me with how to parse a json file into an array? Here's what I've got, but I get an Unexpected Token error. http://pastebin.com/nHyyMKgF
<kevireilly>	kokut: at the breakpoint, does it show a blue [  > overlay on the line?
*	badon_ is now known as badon
<Sorella>	Oh, in fact, there's a nice book with a quote about this
<kevireilly>	Dustin|Work: what does the JSON look like?
<Torkable>	I find it much easier to learn about this kind of stuff in haskell and apply it elsewhere
<Torkable>	just my 2c
<falafel>	indeed
<kokut>	kevireilly: no man its a bug
<cjohnson>	I don't know haskell
<kevireilly>	Dustin|Work: actually, I’m not seeing where you’re loading the JSON, I just see where you’re preparing a path
<kokut>	theres probably a freaking gnome or something adding the breakpoints
<Torkable>	neither did I a year ago
<kevireilly>	kokut: upgrade / reinstall maybe, i dunno mon
<cjohnson>	well that's great but I'm talking in IRC today :P
<Torkable>	and I still totally suck at it lol
<jaawerth>	Sorella: haha okay this is just downright trolling https://github.com/folktale/control.monads#example
<kokut>	kevireilly: lol really
<falafel>	cjohnson, how about a practical example? Do you see the pattern? https://gist.github.com/falafel99/7be517d8e203a7dd0ac1
<cjohnson>	no Sorella when you start writing things as math you lose me. Not everybody went to CS school haha
<cjohnson>	falafel's promise analogy helped a lot
<cjohnson>	or demonstrate of how promise is one
<Sorella>	cjohnson: "Category theory is quite the most general and abstract branch of pure mathematics. [...] The corollary of a high degree of generality and abstraction is that the theory gives almost no assistance in solving the more specific problems within any of the subdisciplines to which it applies. It is a tool for the generalist, of little benefit to the
<Sorella>	practitioner [...]"
<falafel>	cjohnson, that's basically what I just sent you, a continuation monad is basically a way to unnest callbacks, very much like Promise does
<Sorella>	from A Gentle Introduction to Category Theory [with a Chainsaw] (http://doc.utwente.nl/66620/1/db-utwente-0000003535.pdf)
<falafel>	cjohnson, if you add state, and error handling, you got a promise
<cjohnson>	link does't work
<cjohnson>	Whoops
<kevireilly>	Dustin|Work: looks like browserify, are you forgetting to `require` the JSON or something?
<jaawerth>	falafel: hahahaha you know what this is
<cjohnson>	can you reupload falafel
<jaawerth>	this is the guy in Clerks who can't see the sailboat. That's what it's like trying to wrap you head around this stuff until it suddenly clicks
<jaawerth>	wrap your*
<Sorella>	cjohnson: I'm just saying that there's nothing about a monad that allows you to spot monads in your daily code and use the concept in your applications :) It's all overtly general theory that hardly applies directly to real-world problems.
<falafel>	cjohnson, https://gist.github.com/falafel99/25455a4084e10f46298b
<cjohnson>	My brain just doens't work like that I guess Sorella
<jaawerth>	when in doubt, read code (in a language whose syntax you're comfortable with), that's my philosophy
<falafel>	jaawerth, lol
<cjohnson>	yeah no, I do that
<Sorella>	jaawerth: ahaha. I need to add examples to things
<cjohnson>	just in this case, I haven't seen many examples that I glean anything from
<jaawerth>	EXAMPLE: *handwave*
<jaawerth>	*crickets*
<Torkable>	Sorella: they're just types that follow 3 abstract rules, right?
<Sorella>	cjohnson: yup, most people think better in examples and concrete things. Monads are not one of those things, but common implementations of them are things you can actually talk about.
<Sorella>	(Implementing monads for entirely new types is hard ; ~ ;)
<Sorella>	Torkable: yeah
<jaawerth>	it's funny because I had to bang my head against them a bit much like cjohnson is now before I got them, but once it clicked I realized I'd actually written the damn things before
<jaawerth>	not an uncommon thing to run into in programming but it always makes you feel silly
<Sorella>	I spent almost a day thinking about how best to implement a monad for Plan in Purr, then gave up and just stole Scalaz's implementation :D
<Torkable>	heh
<cjohnson>	I find that's pretty much everything in programming after you pass 101
<cjohnson>	it's discovering patterns in things you've been doing all along
<cjohnson>	I definitely already see lots of examples
<Sorella>	Yeah
<cjohnson>	just read "programmable semicolons"
<epichero>	struggle and struggle and then it will click and "oh fml"
<jaawerth>	Programmers: reinventing the wheel since 1960
<cjohnson>	haha
<Torkable>	with a lot of these abstract things, if I just sorta go with my gut, it works and makes sense, but if I focus specifically on it I lose it and non of it makes sense
<Torkable>	:P
<Sorella>	I think people can relate more to monoids, semigroups, and stuff because they're used to seeing those things all the time when dealing with numbers. And the symbols are the same too.
<jaawerth>	let's face it, everything we're doing Ada Lovelace had already figured out hwo to do with punchcards
<Sorella>	But then they see `[1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6] => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and you say "Well, that's actually the same operation as `+` in `1 + 2`"... well, that's probably not going to be easy to take in for most people :P
<Dustin|Work>	<kevireilly>, that might be the problem I think I need to load the actual JSON file contents into JS then run the parser correct?
<Dustin|Work>	Is there a function I can use to include the json file and grab the contents into a string?
<kevireilly>	Dustin|Work: yup, can’t parse the path, can parse the JSON string returned by loading the path
<jaawerth>	Sorella: oh btw, my friendling needling about the docs aside I do think  the folktale stuff would benefit from a glossary for people who aren't familiar with all the terms (especially since a lot of JS programmers probably ARE familiar with the concept, just not the generalized abstraction of it)
<kevireilly>	Dustin|Work: require if that was indeed browserify
<Sorella>	jaawerth: it's on the works :D Together with a "Folktale by Example" book, that shows how you apply this overtly abstract thingies to actual real-world every-day thingies
<Sorella>	Or in the works. I never know which one to use
<jaawerth>	ahh, nice
<jaawerth>	in the works
<kevireilly>	Dustin|Work: so, try `var ParsedJson = JSON.parse(require(MapPath));` if that path is indeed valid at compilation time
<jaawerth>	but I got what you meant
<Torkable>	what's folktale
<kevireilly>	cjohnson: using osx by chance?
<cjohnson>	yeah
<cjohnson>	do you know if chrome keeps the extension file around?
<kevireilly>	cjohnson: any possibility I can get you to send me the extension of your puter?
<cjohnson>	maybe I can send it to you
<cjohnson>	hah
<Sorella>	Torkable: a collection of libraries for functional programming in JS, relying heavily on category theory and abstract algebra concepts
<jaawerth>	Torkable: including monads
<kevireilly>	cjohnson: ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions/ but I can’t find the original ID shit so you might have to dig through the folders… trying to find that now
<Torkable>	cool
<cjohnson>	https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pagespeed-insights-by-goo/gplegfbjlmmehdoakndmohflojccocli?hl=en
<kevireilly>	cjohnson: might actually be listened in extensions manager or something
<cjohnson>	maybe that
<kevireilly>	yup, so maybe ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions/gplegfbjlmmehdoakndmohflojccocli
<Torkable>	is it published?
<jaawerth>	https://github.com/folktale/folktale
<Torkable>	nvm found iut
<Torkable>	oh thanks
<jaawerth>	TOO LATE
<Torkable>	:)
<Torkable>	oh written by Sorella
<kevireilly>	cjohnson: some other potentials http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17377337/where-to-find-extensions-installed-folder-for-google-chrome-on-mac
<jaawerth>	yesterday I went looking for it because I wanted to start tinkering with this stuff more in js (but without reinventing the wheel) but I kept confusing the name with fantasyland (which is also a thing) and ended up going on a mystical journey through Sorella's github history until I found it
<Sorella>	'A mystical journey through Sorella's github history' ahaha
<cjohnson>	kevireilly: found, uploading
<kevireilly>	cjohnson: <3
<jaawerth>	I'm pretty sure there was a wizard
<Torkable>	Sorella: where do you get time to write all this cool stuff lol
<jaawerth>	and there was definitely a mermaid
<Sorella>	It'd be more funny if I was still naming my projects with people from Greek mythology :P
<Sorella>	Torkable: I get to do some of this stuff for work :P
<epichero>	we all have that phase
<Torkable>	Sorella: well that's a good deal
<jaawerth>	I've been trying to get some momentum in building up a public codebase lately. When I start publishing I'll probably go to my standby of naming things after litrary detectives for a while
<jaawerth>	(of course, some of them will be taken)
<Sorella>	Some are more personal projects because I'm excited about something, or want it to support some hobby of mine (like my text editor for novel writing)
<jaawerth>	yeah but the personal projects also have the more hilarious names
<Sorella>	You should switch between detectives and famous thiefs, like Arsène Lupin
<jaawerth>	that's a great idea
<cjohnson>	good example falafel
<jaawerth>	also someday I will name a lib after the sheep man from a couple of Haruki Murakami novels. He isn't a detective but he is a mysterious figure (dressed up like a sheep) who shows up out of nowhere to help the pseudo-detective protagnoist
<jaawerth>	protagonist, even
<afmza>	how do i step back to the object container? in knocjout its $partent, what is it in normal js?
<epichero>	i named my sadly unfinished log analyzer haruspex and from then on i realized i really have to stop with my obscure bs
<afmza>	#parent
<bprompt>	afmza:      ELOBJ.parentNode  is the node containing the element in the markup
<afmza>	ELOBJ?
<bprompt>	afmza:  heheh, the object whose you need the parent
<afmza>	TypeError: this.parentNode is undefined
*	robotmayo is now known as zz_robotmayo
<jaawerth>	epichero: the world needs more log analyzers
*	oddskill is now known as oddskill_away
<fooey>	anyone have experience using hired.com to look for a developer job?
<fooey>	how hard they push you get referrals makes me less convinced they're legit
<bprompt>	afmza:    then it doesn't have one :)
<epichero>	they are legit it's just the industry isn't <3
<epichero>	the bar is below sea level is what i'm smaying
<epichero>	saying even
<fooey>	seems my biggest problem is I have no interest in dealing with startups
<epichero>	does anyone recognize the theme here http://famo.us/university/lessons/#/famous-102/layout/1
<dman777_alter>	hello, is there a better way to do this? terms = [$location.search().device] || [$location.search().dc] || []
<new_one>	I have a file input element f and when it's used I can read f.files[0]; but how can I clear this entry?
<new_one>	dman777_alter: maybe [$location.search().device || $location.search().dc]
<afmza>	new_one, f.files[0] = null;
<dman777_alter>	new_one: excellent idea, thanks
<bprompt>	epichero:    there are many dark themes that look like so
<new_one>	dman777_alter: actually that would leave an [undefined] if both are undefined
<jaawerth>	if both are false you'd end up with an array with a false value in it
<jaawerth>	and/or undefined, yeah
<bprompt>	epichero:     komodo editor default theme is pretty  much like that
<new_one>	afmza: I tried this, and it does not work
<bprompt>	and I think also sublimeText2 editor default as well
<new_one>	f.files[0] = null; f.files[0] === null      --> false
<new_one>	um apparently I should set f.value = "";
<jaawerth>	dman777_alter: there are a bunch of ways you COULD do it, but I'm not sure which one I'd actually recommend without knowing the full context of where the code wuld go
<tejasmanohar>	anyone here used optimizely and recommend yay/nay
<tejasmanohar>	i feel its kinda a challenge to use for responsive sites or with a lot of css if youre changing images and stuff
<tejasmanohar>	text fine
<cjohnson>	what is optimizely?
<Dustin|Work>	Do i need a special lib loaded to use require() ?
<epichero>	bprompt thanks
<cjohnson>	Dustin|Work: where are you using it?
<cjohnson>	in node? no. in the browser? yes
<cjohnson>	unless babel
<cjohnson>	(I think)
<epichero>	in the browser you do
<Dustin|Work>	Javascript/jQuery
<jaawerth>	no, bower won't do it
<Dustin|Work>	Browser
<jaawerth>	er
<jaawerth>	babel
<cjohnson>	babel doesn't shim some kind of require for the module loader?
<jaawerth>	SystemJS/browserify/webpack
<cjohnson>	no es6 module support?
<jaawerth>	well, SystemJS OR es6-module-loader.. I don't *think* babel pulls in es6-module-loader by default, no
<epichero>	i suggest using browserify via gulp personally
<jaawerth>	that's the simplest approach, yes
<jaawerth>	I love SystemJS but it's a bit, uh, bleeding edge still for me to recommend it to people just getting into the concept
<cjohnson>	no reason to use gulp you can just use browserify
<Dustin|Work>	This is the right lib http://requirejs.org/ ?
<jaawerth>	except gulp is awesome :D
<cjohnson>	meh
<epichero>	you could
<jaawerth>	shhh
*	StylishKitsune is now known as SugarRush
<cjohnson>	unnecessary most of hte time
<cjohnson>	http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/why-we-should-stop-using-grunt/ etc
<epichero>	but if you are going to work on complex javascript, possibly isomorphic project structures then yes, i suggest learning gulp now and getting it out of the way
<epichero>	yeah that's nice, idgaf what some blogger thinks
<epichero>	and i've read it
<cjohnson>	I was sending that to jaawerth
<Dustin|Work>	Sorry guys, im mainly a PHP guy, trying to do some work with JS/HTML and getting use to how JS does it's shit
<Dustin|Work>	HTML5*
<epichero>	the guy just whores out to NPM and ends up doing the exact same thing he'd be doing in grunt/gulp
<epichero>	by delegating it to npm
<jaawerth>	cjohnson: I've read that, and I don't agree when it comes to gulp. While gulp has plugins, you really don't need them most of the time. The benefit of still using gulp is that it allows you to adhere to a pattern/convention for your build process around its tasks, which allows for better interopability
<epichero>	he proposes no solution
<cjohnson>	exactly. by delegating to middleman deps
<cjohnson>	Which is exactly hwat I disagree with
<jaawerth>	no
<jaawerth>	you can write tasks with your own code
<cjohnson>	it's fine now, while everybody's real excited and maintaining their middleware
<jaawerth>	the plugins are just extra
<jaawerth>	and yeah, people rely on them too much
<cjohnson>	sure, but then you're talking about nothing better than npm scripts
<cjohnson>	for 90% of projects, anyway
<d4rklit3>	this an ok place for harmony?
<jaawerth>	right, except you've got it organized around the idea of a task, and an easy framework for setting tasks to depend on one anotehr
<cjohnson>	sure some people have crazy build pipelines
<d4rklit3>	jshint seems to not like this: import * as tiles from './modules/_tiles.js';
<epichero>	and the reason i personally bother with it all is because i don't exist on a single machine i like being able to maintain my projects across my various environments
<cjohnson>	Yeah but that's really not a hard concept in npm scripts...
<cjohnson>	basically his point at the article I think sums it up nicely
<cjohnson>	"start with scripts. if you truly find that they're more cumbersome than grunt/gulp, use them"
<jaawerth>	it isn't but if you take away a framework for it you end up seeing a wild west of build processes
<cjohnson>	but it makes more sense to start basic and add tools as managing becomes hard
<jaawerth>	"well just excute 'run' and it will built itself and then run"
<cjohnson>	instead of arbitrarily introducing deps upfront
<jaawerth>	feels more like the old days of configure scripts and dep scripts and then make; make build; make install
<epichero>	running a bunch of different commands is actually more trouble, which is why everyone isn't just using npm(which is great)
<cjohnson>	you don't need to run a bunch of different commands
<epichero>	that's why we abstract it despite the flaws in that approach
<cjohnson>	it's like any other programming -- if you bunch a bunch of tasks, you acn just wrap them in another script
<jaawerth>	I know you don't, but when you have a common framework it encourages devs to stick to patterns
<cjohnson>	sure, and that's why my caveat was there. for some projects your structure is so complex that sticking to a framework without some code to enforce it is hard
<cjohnson>	and if you are that project, use build software
<epichero>	if you're already wrapping them then you're doing something just as complicated (even more complicated) than just conforming to the industry best practice tools like grunt and gulp
<cjohnson>	but *starting* with grunt/gulp makes no sense
<jaawerth>	but gulp *is* build software
<cjohnson>	that's a fabrication
<cjohnson>	industry best practice aka your opinion
<jaawerth>	gulpfiles are simply node files that require gulp and use its methods
<cjohnson>	be reasonable
<cjohnson>	jaawerth: right. for those projects, use gulp
<cjohnson>	I'm agreeing
<jaawerth>	oh
<jaawerth>	haha
<cjohnson>	but your default should be to use npm for a new project
<falafel>	I just copy/paste my gulp file, why is it not preferable to just start like that
<jaawerth>	oh. yeah
<epichero>	falafel same, i have a gulp template and i add on if need be
<falafel>	right
<cjohnson>	I view that as the same as defaulting any new page with <script src="jquery.js">
<cjohnson>	personally
<cjohnson>	If I need jquery I won't hesitate to load it... but it's not in my default template
<cjohnson>	I'll try without
<cjohnson>	and that's really what the article was saying, I think
<epichero>	jquery isn't as important as it used to be, i used to start out defaulting to always including it purely to be consistent with how i treat the DOM
<cjohnson>	because no, using gulp/grunt is not "industry best practices"
<cjohnson>	epichero: exactly.
<epichero>	it is though?
<cjohnson>	jquery isn't as important as it used to be.
<cjohnson>	don't be ridiuclous
<epichero>	i'm not?
<cjohnson>	nevermind, I thought you wanted ot have a rational conversation
<jaawerth>	yeah, it really isn't. It's a tool for getting devs to *follow* industry best practice but the tools themselves are orthogonal to that
<jaawerth>	(except grunt sucks and I hate it)
<cjohnson>	yep. I fully agree with having a build workflow
<jaawerth>	(I am totally happy being irrational in my hatred of grunt)
<cjohnson>	lol
<jaawerth>	"oh hey let's define our build process in a static JSON file!"
<cjohnson>	yeah that's definitely dumb
<cjohnson>	I think everybody can agree that's worse than shell scripts
<cjohnson>	at least shell scripts are dynamic
<cjohnson>	hah
<negaduck>	hi! I want to do window.open(...). Should I use an onclick on a button or a link?
<cjohnson>	those 2 things aren't related. use the click event on which ever element you want to use it on
<cjohnson>	don't use inline handlers though
<cjohnson>	!mdn addEventListener @ negaduck
<ecmabot>	negaduck: EventTarget.addEventListener() - Web API Interfaces | MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener>
<jaawerth>	also in general it's best to keep links for their original purpose: opening web pages
<jaawerth>	if your new window is a web page, then sure, use a link if you want ;-)
<negaduck>	I want to open a window for oauth2
*	itscassa is now known as itscassa|away
<cjohnson>	sounds good
<jaawerth>	oh. then I'd probably use a button but no reason you couldn't use a link
<cjohnson>	or a link that looks like a button
<cjohnson>	!
<cjohnson>	hah
<jaawerth>	haha was just gonna say that
<epichero>	more of a UX choice
<jaawerth>	or a button that looks like a link HEAD ASPLODE
<negaduck>	no difference then? good
<negaduck>	when a browser blocks a popup?
<cjohnson>	jaawerth: http://jsfiddle.net/qhefhk6f/
<epichero>	ask yourself as a user what do you expect an oauth behavior to look like
<cjohnson>	users don't know what oauth is
<jaawerth>	cjohnson: science has gone TOO FAR
<cjohnson>	lol
<epichero>	they know what the "thingy that lets me use my facebook or twitter or google account" does though
<jaawerth>	I recommend styling your OAUTH as a choose your own adventure novel
<jaawerth>	cjohnson: in truth, I like the general setup of gulp but I really got into it before I'd done heavy node dev
<jaawerth>	cjohnson: so at the time it was a nice abstraction of the streams
<jaawerth>	now that streams are mine to commend I really don't use it as much except sometimes out of habit
<cjohnson>	I've only ever commanded a garden hose
<jaawerth>	same thing
<cjohnson>	stream.kink()
<new_one>	If I call Array.sort(_ => Math.random() - Math.random()), do I get a random shuffle?
<Dustin|Work>	Can anyone help me figure out how I need to adjust my javascript to access the data array in the json? http://pastebin.com/q2d2iQKp
<falafel>	new_one, that doesn't look right

<forQuery>	it didnt work but it's a larger problem for me to figure out some other day...
<forQuery>	    widgetList.init = function (body) {
<forQuery>	  if we do something like this, this method is not anoymous, i dont think?
<cjohnson>	if it is function() and not function foo(), it is anonymouse
<cjohnson>	-e
<cjohnson>	doesn't matter what's on the left side of the equal
<forQuery>	ohokay so this is also an anoymous function. i get it, thank you scjohnson
<cjohnson>	np
<cjohnson>	paste some code if you want to figure out what went wrong with your attempt
<Hello71>	>> var a = function (){}, b = function c(){}; console.log(a); console.log(b);
<ecmabot>	Hello71: undefined; Console: function () { }, (function) c
<NBhosting>	whats the best way to get 0.7457547457 to 0 i dont wanna use round, just want to get the number before the dot
<cjohnson>	Math.floor
<NBhosting>	ah ofc round it down :P sometimes i think to complicated
<cjohnson>	;)
<Thorn__>	0.7457547457 | 0
<cjohnson>	better to be clear
<cjohnson>	instead of clever
<forQuery>	better to be cjohnson instead of forquery, your app will be much better.
<cjohnson>	lol
*	musty farts.
<austincheney>	i guess chrome is just not well optimized for arrays
<austincheney>	http://jsperf.com/array-prototype-last
<deltab>	NBhosting: will it ever be negative?
<NBhosting>	nop floor worked well
<cjohnson>	austincheney: stop wasting time trying ot micro-optizmie the least important part of your code
<musty>	That should be topic.
<austincheney>	cjohnson: it is pretty important to things like parsers, editors, and other code that is both decision heavy and dealing with large arrays
<cjohnson>	if your app is under performing, use a profiler and find out way
<cjohnson>	don't just pick random things to "optizmie"
<austincheney>	array[array.length - 1] must occur in my code many dozen possibly hundreds of times
<deltab>	why?
<cjohnson>	still, if you use a profiler I sincerely doubt it will be any where close to the top of the abusers
<cjohnson>	not to mention without any application context you have no idea how well it will actually perform
<austincheney>	deltab: the tokenizer part of my parsers generally need access to the most recently populated index more than any other index
<cjohnson>	use a profiler though and get back to us -- if that is truly a performance issue I'll be surprised
<cjohnson>	otherwise you're wasting your time when you could be optimizing the code that is actually slow
<deltab>	austincheney: maybe have separate variables for those
<austincheney>	cjohnson: a profiler would not tell you this. a profiler will tell you how functions are performing and not arrays as closures
<cjohnson>	ok, do it this way. use your .last method, and replace all your calls to .last
<cjohnson>	then run your profiler
<austincheney>	i could do that
<cjohnson>	if you are truly actually spending that much on that lookup, .last should show up high on the list
<cjohnson>	But I *guarantee* reading the length property is pretty much nil
<austincheney>	even if doing that makes my code a bit slower it would be far cleaner
<cjohnson>	it wouldn't even make it slower to any real degree. reading the .length property takes nothing
<austincheney>	cjohnson: its not that each lookup is slow, but that there are many lookups, which adds up to slowness
<cjohnson>	austincheney: well, use a profiler and confirm that
<cjohnson>	if every lookup passes through this function, and they add up to any substantial amount, the function shows up high on the profiler
<cjohnson>	look at it this way: it doesn't matter what they add up to. your function doesn't actually make any fewer lookups right
<cjohnson>	you'er going to do the same number
<cjohnson>	so whether a thousand paper cuts add up to a real injury is irrelevant if you're just replacing one papercut for another
<cjohnson>	but anyway, profile code. otherwise you're basically just making shit up
<javascript911>	hi
<cjohnson>	hi javascript911
<javascript911>	any advice on what JS front end to choose these days on the MVC
<javascript911>	hi john
<cjohnson>	my advice: only pull in a framework/lib if you truly want to mess with it, or have a specific need for it
<cjohnson>	if you're just writing an application, not everything needs a framework to start from
<cjohnson>	just pull in modules as you discover exactly what you need
<javascript911>	ummm..... how about AMD... should i use require JS or yesnope
<cjohnson>	I would suggest npm + browserify
<cjohnson>	commonjs-style modules if you're writing from scratch
<cjohnson>	easy migration path to es6 modules I believe
<cjohnson>	easier than AMD
<javascript911>	oh
<javascript911>	which build is better grunt or gulp
<cjohnson>	Same advice: if you're just starting a project, use neither until you find you need to
<cjohnson>	http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/why-we-should-stop-using-grunt/
<cjohnson>	don't just pull in dependencies if you have no specific need for them

<Phibonacci>	Hello. Is there a way to declare a lambda function in a condition ? Like : `if (function (){return true;}){}` ? This syntax is not working.
<cjohnson>	you want it to run?
<cjohnson>	that is simply declaring it and returning it
<cjohnson>	!iife
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: An "immediately invoked function expression" is an expression that both creates and calls a function. As with any function call, a scope is created. "(function () { /* ... */ }())" is the most common form. For more info: http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
<Phibonacci>	I'd like it to run.
<cjohnson>	>> if ((function(){ return false;})()){ console.log('false'); } else { console.log('true'); }
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: undefined; Console: 'true'
<Phibonacci>	If the result of the function is true, do this.
<Phibonacci>	thanks !
<cjohnson>	well that's odd. must be overlooking something. but that's how you'd do it...though that smells of bad code
<javascript911>	npm or bower what to use
<cjohnson>	npm javascript911
<Torqable>	npm
<cjohnson>	it's what node uses by default
<cjohnson>	don't use bower
<javascript911>	why
<cjohnson>	just npm + browserify should cover all your cases
<cjohnson>	it's not a true dep manager
<javascript911>	ok
<cjohnson>	it basically just downloads files for you
<Phibonacci>	I simply want to throw an error if my variable is not an array and every one of its elements are not a string.
<cjohnson>	Phibonacci: why do you need a function for that?
<Torqable>	umm
<javascript911>	bower updates newer JS versions right?
<Torqable>	is every in standard lib
<cjohnson>	if (!Array.isArray(arr) || arr.filter(function(v) { return typeof v != 'string'; }).length > 0) {  throw 'poop'; }
<cjohnson>	Phibonacci:
<Torqable>	yar it is
<cjohnson>	oh yeah every
<cjohnson>	that returns true right
<cjohnson>	perfect that's exactly right
<Phibonacci>	Thought I could do something like `if (typeof array != "object" || function (){/*for that tests all elements*/}()){throw Error()}`
<Torqable>	>> [1, "2", 3].every(function(item) { return typeof item === 'String'; })
<ecmabot>	Torqable: (boolean) false
<Torqable>	:)
<cjohnson>	if (!Array.isArray(arr) || !arr.every(function(v) { return typeof v == 'string'; })) { throw 'poop'; }
<Torqable>	>> ["1", "2", "3"].every(function(item) { return typeof item === 'String'; })
<ecmabot>	Torqable: (boolean) false
<Torqable>	oh wut
<cjohnson>	string
<Torqable>	derp
<Torqable>	>> ["1", "2", "3"].every(function(item) { return typeof item === 'string'; })
<ecmabot>	Torqable: (boolean) true
<Phibonacci>	that's a standard function ? o:
<cjohnson>	!es6-shim @ Phibonacci
<ecmabot>	Phibonacci: Use https://www.npmjs.com/package/es6-shim to get every backwards-compatible feature of ES6 in every browser and node.js! It's heavily tested, comes with Promises, and requires the !es5-shim.

<ecmabot>	cjohnson: Array.prototype.every() - JavaScript | MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every>
<Torqable>	every is in standard lib

<cjohnson>	don't use typeof to check for arrays
<phutchins>	I'm trying to add an attr to an <a href="http://google.com">link</a> tag (target="_blank") with jQuery or someting similar... I've tried many ways but can't seem to get it to work... Any suggetisons?
<cjohnson>	only primitives pretty much
<Torqable>	^^
<Phibonacci>	Thanks a lot, I'll use both.
<cjohnson>	phutchins: I suggest pasting the ways you've tried so we can point out what's wrong with the

<cjohnson>	oh I guess every came in !es5-shim
<phutchins>	cjohnson: yeah i'm making a quick fiddle now... maybe paste woudl be easier
<cjohnson>	fiddle is ideal

<Eppiox>	what about a slow loading link?
<jbud>	Lol! Couldn't figure out why parseInt was performing so much worse than Math.floor... I would have thought it'd be the other way around: https://jsperf.com/math-floor-vs-math-round-vs-parseint/
<jbud>	Turns out that the 1st arg in parseInt is a string, and if it isn't a string then its converted to a string
<jbud>	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt
<phutchins>	nbt: but what if you have a string with html in it instead of 'document'
<Avon>	http://jsfiddle.net/csLAk/6209/ How would I access the data attribute of the select value?
<cjohnson>	nbt: wrong. and if he already has jquery, no reason to type all that out
*	lizzin is now known as Guest1004
<cjohnson>	phutchins: ok, couple issues. one is, you forgot to add jquery to that fiddle. external resources dropdown on the left
<cjohnson>	if you open your console you will see a big error about $ undefined -- always debug with console open
<cjohnson>	secondly, your last line you would want to be .val($img.html()) if you want to set $img's innerHTML to the textarea's .val()
<cjohnson>	otherwise you're saying "store this node in a string" which makes no sense -- you end up with [object Object]
<cjohnson>	and finally, when you do $(html), you are turning it into a jquery collection that contains 1 element, the <a> tag
<cjohnson>	so there's no need to .find('a'), since obviously you don't have an <a> tag *inside* your <a> tag
<cjohnson>	you would just do this: http://jsfiddle.net/jm5f68uu/1/
<cjohnson>	and actually I'm guessing you actually want the outerHTML, which includes the node's markup itself
<cjohnson>	innerHTML (or in jquery, .html()) returns the html *inside* the given node
<cjohnson>	et voila http://jsfiddle.net/jm5f68uu/2/
<cjohnson>	falafel: would you say a function is a monad? the arguments is the .of and the return is the .chain
<phutchins>	cjohnson: yeah i realized that i forgot jquery a bit ago... been fiddling since but still no luck. ah ah ok about .val($img.html().
<phutchins>	cjohnson: and ahhhhh thats where the object Object comes from!!! Been wondering that for a while lol
<phutchins>	cjohnson: oh man thank you so much. i've been fighting with this ALL day :)
<cjohnson>	no prob :)
<phutchins>	cjohnson: Ok so one piece is left. The 'html' for me is text that was input into a chat app then parsed through marked. So the text could be not just an <a, or not even have a <a tag at all...
<phutchins>	cjohnson: so trying to use .find like we talked about to locate teh a and use that. still doesn't seem to work tho http://jsfiddle.net/t088xxst/
<phutchins>	should I be using .find('a[href]') instead?
<cjohnson>	$a is set to the <a> tag here
<cjohnson>	because you did $a = $(html).find('a')
<cjohnson>	but also, as I said before, *always* have your console open when debugging
<cjohnson>	and pay attention to the errors you get
<phutchins>	i do, and it is :)
<cjohnson>	well it's telling you what's wrong, your string html is an invalid selector for jquery
<cjohnson>	$('<div>') jquery can tell you want a new node
<cjohnson>	but $('This is a <a...etc');
<cjohnson>	that looks like a query selector
<cjohnson>	so I would just do this
<cjohnson>	var container = $('<div>').html(html);
<cjohnson>	container.find('a').attr('target', '_blank');
<cjohnson>	textarea.html(container.html());
<phutchins>	oh neat ok
<phutchins>	So basically the outermost layer has to be contained by some sort of tag
<phutchins>	to use the jquery selector
<cjohnson>	exactly
<cjohnson>	if you don't know that it's going to be wrapped in a single node, you want to use .html(html) to set the html
<cjohnson>	$(html) only works if html is already wrapped in 1 node
<phutchins>	cjohnson: gotcha. trying to get it working now...
<phutchins>	cjohnson: it works!! Thanks again...

<NinjaKrill>	Okay.
<NinjaKrill>	How can I make a counter that can only be incremented once per day by any given IP address? (hopefully not to broad or specific)
<NinjaKrill>	Complete newbie here, but I can read and understand.
*	eh is now known as Torkable
<Narhir>	you mean like how to create unique visitor counter ?
<NinjaKrill>	More or less, yes, but | a. it's only updated when the user clicks on it and | b. it can be used once a day
<Narhir>	so you asusmethat in some days none will visit your website ?
<NinjaKrill>	It's... not a visitor counter. I'm trying to make a game-thingy. Each IP/vistor can, once a day, click a button which increments a global counter.
<NinjaKrill>	(maybe technically a vistor counter but not really)
<Narhir>	I'm stuck on this issue my self.. currently :) https://jsfiddle.net/xcgom65e/
<Narhir>	so you want a BUTTOn that can be clicked only once a day or once an interval of time
<Narhir>	as in "clicker game"
<Narhir>	yes?
<NinjaKrill>	correct
<NinjaKrill>	everyone can see the counter though
<NinjaKrill>	the same one
<Narhir>	yeah..
<Narhir>	but the basics js of increamentation is kinda the same
<NinjaKrill>	yes :P
<NinjaKrill>	the counter I can do, the interval is the issue
<Narhir>	maybe this could help: https://studentrnd.org/build/tutorial-creating-coder-clicker-a-cookie-clicker
<Narhir>	Ninja wanna try to help me out maybe ?:P
<mindbender1>	I'm trying to execute a for..in command from the console but it's reports errors. Does the for..in command work in the console? I'm using chrome specifically.
<NinjaKrill>	Narhir: the thing is I literally know jack about javascript
<Narhir>	:/
<NinjaKrill>	Narhir I can't help you at all :(
<NinjaKrill>	But thank you for the link
<Narhir>	this may give you some tips I'm quite bad at js as well ;d but you should look into those cookie clickers it should defenitly help you in making the intervals and such
<Narhir>	-.-
<NinjaKrill>	Basically, I learn what I want to learn for a specific purpose. I don't know if that's the best way to go about things
<NinjaKrill>	Narhir: I know, I will! I mean I can't help you with your issue because I am a silly nub :(
<NinjaKrill>	Narhir: But thanks for that link.
<Narhir>	lol ;p
<Narhir>	sure sure your welcome
<reynir>	NinjaKrill: it sounds like something you should handle server-side
<NinjaKrill>	reynir: I don't know enough about this, do I
<reynir>	is that a question?
<zth>	hi! i've encountered some javascript syntax that i don't recognize and i was wondering if someone could help me identify what type of syntax it is and where i can read up on it. {googleMapsApi, ...otherProps} = props; <--- where can i read up on what { stuff, stuff } = name is does and means...? and ...otherProps, where can I read up on what that means? does anyone know?
<NinjaKrill>	reynir: :c
<Havvy>	zth:  It's object destructuring, part of ES6.
<reynir>	zth: it looks like maybe destructuring. I think it's a new feature, didn't think any implementations had it yet
<reynir>	NinjaKrill: ??
<Havvy>	reynir:  Babel implements it.
<zth>	aha, thanks! Google-time
<Narhir->	sorry guys I got disconnected did anyone replied regading my jquery selector issues ?;/ https://jsfiddle.net/xcgom65e/
<NinjaKrill>	Sorry, I'm really confused. Would I be able to put my Javascript counter that allows one click a day per IP address on a shared web host or would I need something different? Sorry if that's a stupid question, I don't know a lot about this.
<Havvy>	zth:  Basically it's the same as `googleMapsApi = props.googleMapApi; otherProps = { otherKeys: props.otherKeys, ... };
<NinjaKrill>	It just says that meteor.js is a seperate server thing and :(
<Havvy>	NinjaKrill:  If it's one click per day and you don't want technically savvy people from clicking multiple times, you'd have to do it on the server side.
<zth>	Havvy, ahh ok, thanks! do you mean ... as "any other variables", or is that a thing in the syntax too...? i get confused by all of these dots ;)
<Havvy>	zth:  any other properties also on "props"
<zth>	aha! now i think i get it
<NinjaKrill>	Havvy: is that something that would be possible to do on a shared host?
<zth>	so it's a way of not having to write out every single part of prop that you want to assign i guess...?
<reynir>	NinjaKrill: it really depends on your shared host, but they probably offer php and such so 'yes'
<Havvy>	NinjaKrill:  Sure. As long as they let you run code on the server side. Most allow PHP.
<Havvy>	zth:  Correct.
<Havvy>	It's basically the equivalent of...
<zth>	Havvy, thank you for the explanation!
<Havvy>	var otherProps = {}; Object.keys(props).filter(function (key) { return key !== "googleMapsApi"; }).forEach(function (key) { otherProps[key] = props[key]; });
<reynir>	D:
<NinjaKrill>	reynir, Havvy: thanks! so... it should be handled in php, not js?
<Havvy>	NinjaKrill:  If your only option for server side langauge is PHP, yes.
<Havvy>	If you know how to use something like Linode, you could use whatever backend language you wanted, which includes JS via Node.js. Though you'd have to know how to admin a remote Linux machine.
<reynir>	what about...
<reynir>	heroku
<Havvy>	I don't know what Heroku is.
<NinjaKrill>	Havvy: my web host offers this list of features http://www.hostinginsiders.com/ (are links allowed?)
<NinjaKrill>	It seems like I can do what I need
<reynir>	yea
<reynir>	you can choose between php, perl and python
<NinjaKrill>	so cgi-bin is for scripts?
<reynir>	yes
<NinjaKrill>	ooh. okay, well, I'm sort of familar with python. I'll do research into that.

<Eppiox>	bay2codebreakers depends, i've done uni + 6 months webdev.  Finding it super hard to get a job, but I'm also not doing web stuff in my off time as really..
<bay2codebreakers>	there are a bunch in san francisco and NYC

<Eppiox>	ah
<Eppiox>	Anywho bay2codebreakers in a nutshell what i've gathered from a bootcamp is.. If you want to learn a bit more of a something, in an intesnsive way and practical stuff that you can use, try it out- but you'll need motivation and energy.  It won't help you get a job unless you make something out of it.  Or so people who i've spoken to tell me.
<nullbytes>	Why is the browser not receiving any data through my WebSocket while JavaScript is busy? The incoming data transfer stops completely whenever JavaScript is active.
<yho>	welcome to a single thread

<liranp>	Hi, I'm starting to work on a big project, do you recommend working with React / Flux or Angular, specifically based TypeScript, in order to facilitate the transition to Angular 2 when it is available. It is important to note that my knowledge in React / Flux is not big, compared Angular this version I worked with quite a few ...

<Narhir->	unfortunatly I'm stuck my self :((
<BenL90>	can anyone help me how to set up auto slide using pure js on this code? So the slide show automatically run and still can be click left and right http://jsfiddle.net/4c0er2s2/
<javnut1>	soundjs is pretty complex
<javnut1>	BenL90: first of all, your prev and next function are screwed up

<BenL90>	javnut1: That's not my code, i lazy to code and just take it from a forum. This code help me to solved my problem and i have recode it in my Website(i mean modify it)
<javnut1>	second of all, you need an "autoplay" button
<javnut1>	and that's where you should setInterval or clearInterval
<javnut1>	http://jsfiddle.net/4c0er2s2/5/
<BenL90>	javnut1: Just it? ha?  Oh God.. Where i can learn full java script documentation?
<javnut1>	I wouldn't know, I'm not amazing at JS and I usually only learn what I need
<BenL90>	javnut1:  How to make it infinite?
<javnut1>	meaning?
<BenL90>	javnut1: Yeah I think most of people do it, also me.. I mean make the slide looping, infite, not stop. The code says only 1000 ;o
<javnut1>	BenL90: that's not 1000, it means run function { prev(); } every 5000 milliseconds
<javnut1>	1000 milliseconds = 1 second, so basically, it runs the code every 5 seconds
<BenL90>	javnut1: Okay, i get it, and then why when i click the button the slide stop?

<dostoyevsky>	I would like to see the implementation for jquery's one() function but it's hard to google for
<GreenJello>	dostoyevsky, roughly $.fn.on = function(eventName, handler){ var $el = $(this); $el.on(eventName, function onceHandler(e){ $el.off(eventName, onceHandler); return handler(e);  })  });
<dostoyevsky>	GreenJello: thanks :)
<dostoyevsky>	GreenJello: ah, makes sense but also implies that you set your one handler more often than a normal on handler... good to know
<GreenJello>	well you usually use it when you just want to listen to the event once
<GreenJello>	otherwise it'd be better to have a condition in the handler that does nothing most of the time, because calling $.on is expensive performance wise

<nickhs>	Hi there, I 'm trying to use promises (from Q) and I'm finding in the my .then callbacks the this parameter is set to the nodejs global rather than the object's this - why is that happening? The code is something like Q.nfcall(fs.readFile, someFile).then(this is now global)
<yansanmo>	no binding?
<Havvy>	!this @ nickhs
<ecmabot>	nickhs: If a function call is of the form `a.b()`, `this` will be the object you accessed the "b" property from. Otherwise, if it's of the form `a()`, `this` will be `undefined`, which is turned into the global object if the function isn't in strict mode. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/08/30/understanding-javascripts-this/

<Berra>	Anyone here know of a way to define a large portion of functions inside a IEFF but maybe also object but still split it all into multiple files when working?
<Berra>	So combined it to the common IEFF / object (think underscore.js)
<Berra>	https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore/blob/master/underscore.js
<austincheney>	Berra: there is no way to natively split code across multiple files without external help. ES6 modules intends to solve this problem, but in the mean time you are stuck using something like:
<austincheney>	a build process, mutiple HTML script tags, or just using nodejs
<Berra>	Great answer. I am currently using closure-compiler. Maybe that could somehow function like that?
<austincheney>	aside from ES6 modules there is no universal answer to this problem
<Berra>	Alright
<Berra>	You think just writing a concat script in shell would be alright?
<tipdbmp>	Berra, in my humble experience "shell" scripts are unportable and limited compared to general purpose langauges (assuming dynamic: Python, Perl, Ruby, Php, JavaScript), so you might want to use those for your "concat script"?
<Berra>	tipdbmp: Shell seems like the most portable (ignoring Windows .. and I am always happy to ignore windows)
<tipdbmp>	Hm, it's your call.
<jrajav_>	I've never yet seen a system that a .sh script wouldn't run on, with the one exception of Windows
<Berra>	Exactly
<jrajav_>	And that's not an exception if you have mingw

<Havvy>	`{a} = getSomethingWith_a_OnIt();` would be silly.
<beaky>	yea its very useful for when i am doing deep accessing of properties of deeply nested objects
<beaky>	and rest of code is only about those
<Havvy>	Though at the same time, I've seen code like that for Elixir...
<beaky>	what is elixir
<Havvy>	Elixir is a language that targets the ErlangVM.
<Havvy>	Very similar semantics, extremely different (but better) syntax than Erlang.
<beaky>	wow why are there so many languages out there
<ashnur>	Havvy: is elixir good? :)
<Havvy>	ashnur:  Yes.
<ashnur>	Havvy: I am trying to decide what to learn, clojure or elixir
<Havvy>	Clojure has a more mature ecosystem.
<ashnur>	i mean, which one to start with, because eventually both would be useful to know
<beaky>	yes clojure also has java interop if u love java
<ashnur>	i hate java with a passion
<beaky>	:(
<Havvy>	beaky:  Because computer science is a relatively new field of study and we don't have our tools well refined.
<beaky>	js impresses me with how fast and how abundant tooling is showing up
<Maxdamantus>	beaky:  Because computer science is a somewhat old field of study and people have been coming up with crap for decades.
<ashnur>	Havvy: so, major ecosystem is definitely a plus, but what does it mean in practice. If I learn elixir, I can't do the same things as easy?
<ashnur>	like, common things are missing and are waiting to be implemented?
<Havvy>	Basically.
<Havvy>	Hex.pm has a couple thousand packages total.
<ashnur>	I see, so probably better to go with clojure because less headache if I actually want to use it for something
<ashnur>	Maxdamantus: that doesn't explain why we get new languages
<Havvy>	Right.
<ashnur>	Havvy: thanks :)
<beaky>	yes clojure has java interop so u can leverage the tooling of decades old rich java ecosystem
<beaky>	if u dont find the clojure thing to do it
<ashnur>	i know that, but if elixir had most of the things which are used, then it's not that important
<beaky>	and with clojurescript i can leverage javascript too! :D
<ashnur>	most of java things are shit anyway
<Havvy>	beaky:  There's the decades old Erlang ecosystem for Elixir (where the interop is practically invisible).
<Maxdamantus>	ashnur: why are there so many human languages? Because the linguistic stuff in our brains developed at least fifty thousand years ago.
*	oddskill_afk is now known as oddskill
<beaky>	wow i didnt realize human language was that young
<ashnur>	Maxdamantus: every time someone compares human languages with programming languages, I cringe
<Havvy>	But other than the Erlang standard library (which is huge) and OTP, it's also difficult to find good libraries.
<Maxdamantus>	I'm actually just making up reasons why Havvy's statement is arbitrary.
<ashnur>	the two has nothing in common apart from the name
<Maxdamantus>	beaky: I think it's estimated to be fifty–one hundred and fifty thousand years old.
<Havvy>	Maxdamantus:  Well, yes, people will create languages anyways, just because they can.
<ashnur>	beaky: what is even more weird, we had handaxes for ~1M years
<Havvy>	But the reason we talk about so many of them is because we're constantly refining but getting stuck with older languages.
<ashnur>	and when we got language, suddenly stuff started to change, and it's still changing
<ashnur>	however programming languages are well defined (at least in comparison to human language) and the usage is quite limited. Human languages are just externalized thoughts. Not really viable to study them just by themselves.
*	xiinotulp is now known as plutoniix
<Havvy>	See also: Rust as an iterative refinement over C and C++.
<Maxdamantus>	"just externalized thoughts" doesn't sound very accurate.
<Maxdamantus>	What thought is "colourless green ideas sleep furiously" externalising?
<Havvy>	Maxdamantus:  The thought of thoughts that have no meaning.
<ashnur>	Maxdamantus: i am not Chomsky, so sorry for not being accurate
<Havvy>	Anyways, language allows for the spread of memetic information. Knowledge and jokes mostly.
*	Maxdamantus , on the other hand, is Chomsky.
<ashnur>	yeah, you wish
<Havvy>	[Citation Needed]
<beaky>	i wish i can be chomsky
<Havvy>	https://store-xkcd-com.myshopify.com/products/citation-needed-sticker-pack
<Maxdamantus>	Top CIA officials have stated—and I have no reason to believe otherwise—that I am Noam Chomsky.
<Havvy>	beaky:  Why? Why not be your own person?
*	Maxdamantus sleeps, calmly, hopefully.
<beaky>	btw why should i prefer es6 maps/sets for data structure stuff rather than what i've always done (objects for everything)
<beaky>	plus v8 will optimize objects down to c structs i probably cant say the same of es6 maps/sets
<ashnur>	not yet
<Havvy>	beaky:  Use them the same place you'd use a HashMap or HashSet from other languages.
<nicholas_c>	Random none-JS question of the day. What color would you say "#444f55" is?
<Havvy>	nicholas_c:  #css ?
<Havvy>	beaky:  Plus you can use non-string keys in a Map().
<beaky>	http://www.colorhexa.com/444f55 "very dark grayish blue"
<beaky>	wow i can use arrays/objects as map keys? thats awesome
<nicholas_c>	Havvy, shoulda, woulda, coulda.
<nicholas_c>	beaky, Yeahhhh, doesn't help with my var name lol
<Havvy>	slate-blue?
<beaky>	yeah slate blue is a nice name
<nicholas_c>	thanks Havvy and beaky
<DragonPunch>	okay
<antsanto>	What all js hidden features you use in ur projects?
<Havvy>	"hidden features"?
<ElGoorf>	does anyone here do the JS challenges on codewars?
*	KhaozKitty is now known as ChaozHenchman
<KonKalid>	any pastebin ?

<mbwe>	anybody experience with changing the docker storage engine
<mbwe>	oops
<mbwe>	wrong channel
<dostoyevsky>	evilc, the opposite to holyc
<dostoyevsky>	but isn't docker also something javascript related?
<Havvy>	dostoyevsky:  Docker is written (IIRC) in Go.
<dostoyevsky>	ah, ok
<cjohnson>	beaky: you wouldn't prefer maps to objects if you weren't using objects as maps. you would use maps when you want an actual map
<cjohnson>	and even if performance if map *today* is slower than straight objects, in situatinos where you want maps, it makes more sense to go with the standard that they *will* optimize as time goes on
<cjohnson>	which is exactly why you shouldn't really compare "performance" of one trivial data structure to another
<cjohnson>	it should be about usability and readability and maintainability. performance doesn't enter the discussion
<dostoyevsky>	I am a little bit confused about this channel, as to whether more people here work with something like io.js et al or just a browser but I guess dom questions are ok :)
<cjohnson>	it's a general javascript channel
<cjohnson>	all things JS
<cjohnson>	browser, server side, etc
<Havvy>	That said, we might point you to a specific channel if we think it'd be better.
<dostoyevsky>	how about cofeescript?
<Havvy>	Coffeescript is unreadable. :P
*	pleeby is now known as bleepy
<dostoyevsky>	I never used it actually :)
<liranp>	Hi, I'm starting to work on a big project and really can not decide which framework to use, should I go with React + Flux or Angular2? The release date of the project is a few months from now, so it doesn't have to be 100% production ready for now...
<dostoyevsky>	react, flux, angular, angular2 -- would be interested to know the differences between these frameworks :)
<yeinnyvex-y-cris>	hola a todos
<cjohnson>	react is more of a view handler than a monolithic framework
<Sorella>	dostoyevsky: the only ones that solve the same problem there are angular and angular2, with the second being a redesign of the first.
<liranp>	yeah, but together with flux is a different story...
<Sorella>	React is a rendering library. Flux is an eventing library.
<dostoyevsky>	is react similar to bootstrap?
<cjohnson>	bootstrap is a CSS framework
<Berra>	Anyone here use closure-compiler and know how to define a globals so it doesn't produce undefined variable for that var?
<cjohnson>	with some JS sprinkled in
<Sorella>	dostoyevsky: no, bootstrap is a CSS framework
<yeinnyvex-y-cris>	pueden hablar en español lo que pasa  es que no se hablar en ingles
<cjohnson>	Berra: var foo; in the global scope
<cjohnson>	var foo = 'something that isnt undefined'; anyway
<yeinnyvex-y-cris>	porfavor
<Sorella>	React is something you can use to describe your user interface and have it rendered somewhere. It's not even directly related to the DOM or browsers
<Berra>	cjohnson: No that's not what I need. I have my files split up and then concat them later, I just need closure-compiler to be aware that when I use a certain variable it's already defined just in a nother files.
<yeinnyvex-y-cris>	hola sorella
<dostoyevsky>	Sorella: with react I could also render on the server, e.g. to have static pages for stuff that's normally rendered in the browser, right?
<cjohnson>	I've never had any issues with that Berra
<cjohnson>	what are you having trouble iwth
<Sorella>	dostoyevsky: you can take the React's description of your UI and do anything you want. Sure. There are backends that render it to an HTML string, there are backends that render it to canvas, there are backends that render it to Browser's DOM elements, and nothing prevents you from writing a backend that uses Qt or GTK, or anything really.
<yeinnyvex-y-cris>	nadie a poder hablar en español
<Berra>	cjohnson: http://hastebin.com/oquhudepoj.js
<yeinnyvex-y-cris>	hola berra como estais
<Berra>	When closure-compiler reads File example 1 it complains that foo is undefined. I want to just ignore that.
<Sorella>	yeinnyvex-y-cris: this is an English discussion channel, you might try finding a Spanish one in this network. I'm particularly not aware of any.
<cjohnson>	Berra: it's just a warning, I imagine
<cjohnson>	not an actual error
<Berra>	Yes, I want to silence it.
<cjohnson>	you can suppress warnings
<cjohnson>	let me look real quick
<Berra>	Yes but I only want to supress it for the variable foo
<cjohnson>	--warning_level=QUIET
<cjohnson>	that doesn't make sense
<yeinnyvex-y-cris>	que sorella no te en tiendo nada
<cjohnson>	hagb4rd: can you **please** make jslave stop responding to lines not directed at it?
<cjohnson>	nothing starting with ~ or -
<cjohnson>	if I'm not saying jslave: foo  or jslave> 'foo' or something, don't response to me
<cjohnson>	via notice, query, or otherwise
<cjohnson>	Berra: that doesn't sound like the right way to use the compiler tool
<inimino>	what's jslave?
<cjohnson>	Berra: arbitrarily suppressing warnings about specific variables...bleh
<cjohnson>	inimino: an unnecessary extra bot that hagb4rd has put in the channel
<cjohnson>	Berra: what I would do is separate concatenating from closure compiler. concat first, then feed the concatted file into closure
<inimino>	what does it respond to?
<cjohnson>	I just typed --warning_level=QUIET and it queried me
<cjohnson>	and also
<cjohnson>	~10
<jslave>	cjohnson: 10
<cjohnson>	which isn't even right
<cjohnson>	>> ~10
<ecmabot>	cjohnson: (number) -11
<cjohnson>	I've never seen anybody intentionally use it, it just starts spewing things to people not aiming commands at it
<Sorella>	yeinnyvex-y-cris: este es un canal de discusión en Inglés, puede intentar encontrar un canal donde se habla Español en esta red. Yo particularmente no conozco ninguna.
<Sorella>	(Also I don't speak Spanish, and I doubt most people here do)
<Sorella>	-10
<cjohnson>	--10
<Sorella>	Right, so at least - doesn't trigger it
<cjohnson>	PMs for that
<cjohnson>	-10
<inimino>	--warning_level=QUIET
<inimino>	well, that's weird
<yeinnyvex-y-cri1>	eeeeesooo
<inimino>	maybe it's the -- that does it
<cjohnson>	yeah it is
<Sorella>	hagb4rd: please fix your bot.
<inimino>	--test
*	valentin_ZNC is now known as RandomGuys

<jslave>	inimino: 10
<inimino>	wow, it's running on Windows
*	RandomGuys is now known as valentinovd__
<cjohnson>	hahaha
<Berra>	cjohnson: Yes but then closure-compiler can't give me correct file name and line number for errors anymore.
<cjohnson>	right well those are your options I think
<cjohnson>	suppress warnings, or pre-concat
<cjohnson>	I pre-concat and just append a comment with teh filename at the top of each file
<cjohnson>	so I at least have an idea of where to look
<cjohnson>	you could always just stop using global variables which are bad anyway :)

<Sorella>	~10
<hagb4rd>	inimo: that's a feature
<Sorella>	hagb4rd: ok thanks :)
<hagb4rd>	yup
<hagb4rd>	thank you
<hagb4rd>	i didn't know ~ is a symbol^^

<jslave>	hagb4rd: 10
<hagb4rd>	ok
<cjohnson>	~10
<cjohnson>	--10
<cjohnson>	that's fine then
<cjohnson>	as long as it only responds when I specifically talking to it
<hagb4rd>	welly well.
<hagb4rd>	actually 2134230485z23948z2259745z378945z79 will send you a private response... just ignore it then
<cjohnson>	that's pretty unique I'm ok with that
<beaky>	is reactjs a step backwards in terms of frontend design
<hagb4rd>	ok
<cjohnson>	beaky: a step backward as compared to what
<beaky>	cjohnson: usually we separate template definitions from view logic and styles, but react encouraged you to have all 3 per component definition
<inimino>	it's a step forward
<cjohnson>	component is just that
<cjohnson>	a bundling of the logic with the view so you can distribute them
<inimino>	none of those three things are usable separately anyway
<cjohnson>	it's not a step back or a step forward, it's just another approach
<cjohnson>	just like MVC is an approach
<cjohnson>	depends what you're doing
<inimino>	yes, that's true
<cjohnson>	you can separate them but still bundle them together as well beaky
*	temur is now known as Guest7144
<beaky>	i personally like the react approach (its the only way i get things done) but i feel like react's approach was an approach taken by desktop apps that ended up failing for some other approach
*	sr_berry is now known as ser_berry
<gambl0re>	if i am already proficient in rails do you think its still necessary to learn backbone/angular?
<cjohnson>	there's a difference between bundling things and strictly binding them together I think
<cjohnson>	I can deliver a controller that comes with a view by default, but allow you to replace the view if you want
<inimino>	I don't think it's necessary to learn angular for any reason, gambl0re.
<inimino>	gambl0re: but why are you interested in it?
<beaky>	yes angular is out of vogue anyway the new cool kid to learn is reactjs
<cjohnson>	hah
<cjohnson>	damn kids and their monolithic frameworks
<inimino>	Rails is too.
<cjohnson>	ok motorcycle time
<Sorella>	beaky: nothing prevents you from separating "logic" from "data" from "whatever" in React.
<beaky>	yeah rails is out of vogue too the approach now is to reinvent rails with your own adhoc nodejs framework based on expressjs
<Sorella>	beaky: it's just a declarative library for declaring interfaces.
<inimino>	Which is worth it because then you don't have to use Rails. :)
<beaky>	wow whats happening
<Havvy>	beaky:  Yeah...I suggest using Django or something.
<Havvy>	Once July hits, I'll be suggesting Phoenix.
<inimino>	netsplit
<gambl0re>	im learning rails because thats whats being taught..
<beaky>	whats phoenix
<inimino>	gambl0re: Oh, that's a pity...
<gambl0re>	why do you say that.
<beaky>	rails isnt so bad imo
<inimino>	gambl0re: Are you in some coding bootcamp or something?
<gambl0re>	no im doing the odin project..
<gambl0re>	if you know what that is.
<inimino>	I'm just not a fan of Ruby or Rails, or what I've seen of the community around them.
<inimino>	I don't know what that is.
<nomic>	neither am I
<nomic>	why go there - use python
<Havvy>	beaky:  Phoenix is a web framework on top of Elixir.
*	bacteu2 is now known as bact
<inimino>	That's the JVM thing you were talking about earlier?
<BenL90>	Anyone can help me, how to give every div with class name "something" a width
<gambl0re>	angular and backbone are used only on the front end?
<Havvy>	It's being worked on by Chris McCord and Jose Valim.  Jose Valim is the author of the Elixir language (which sits on top of Erlang's VM) and also an ex-Rails contributor.
<inimino>	Oh, Erlang.
<gambl0re>	or can angular/backbone be used on back end also?
<cjohnson>	var divs = document.getElementsByClassName('something'); [].forEach.call(divs, function(node) { node.style.width = '100px'; });
<Havvy>	BenL90:  Array.prototype.split(document.querySelector(".something")).forEach(function (element) { element.width = "400px"; });
<cjohnson>	BenL90: ^
<cjohnson>	Array.prototype.split is undefined here
<cjohnson>	nothing on mdn either
<cjohnson>	what is that
<inimino>	I think he wanted slice()
<cjohnson>	still wouldn't be the right syntax would it
<inimino>	since qSA returns a NodeList
<inimino>	yeah, still not right
<inimino>	needs apply
<cjohnson>	[].slice.call(document.querySelector('.something')).forEach
<inimino>	needs null as the first argument, too
<cjohnson>	good call
<cjohnson>	hehe he
<cjohnson>	hehe
<cjohnson>	ok
<inimino>	^_^
<beaky>	btw why cant i give .apply null as first arugment
<inimino>	you don't have IRC on your motorcycle, I hope :P
<inimino>	you can
<cjohnson>	lol no I caught the screen as I was walking away
<beaky>	>[].concat.apply(null, [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]);
<beaky>	>>[].concat.apply(null, [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]);
<ecmabot>	beaky: TypeError: can't convert null to object
<beaky>	>>[].concat.apply([], [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]);
<ecmabot>	beaky: (object) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
<cjohnson>	well, that's concat
<cjohnson>	not apply
<beaky>	oh
<cjohnson>	it expects "this" to be an array
<inimino>	right

<ecmabot>	beaky: (object) [{}, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

<beaky>	oh
<beaky>	b> `$`
<babelbot>	beaky: $
<Berra>	cjohnson: I am back. Well they are not global variables (that's just a "name" from JSLint I used - you can set a /* globals varname */ to auto ignore).
<Berra>	The files that I include are on compiler actually inside the IIFE
<cjohnson>	then it shouldn't complain about the var not existing
<cjohnson>	becuase it's either passed as an argument, or via require(), or it's declared within the iife
<cjohnson>	if not, then it's a global, which is bad
<cjohnson>	if you don't care that it's bad, I would just suppress warnings
<cjohnson>	or pre-concat :)
<cjohnson>	for REAL tho leaving now
<cjohnson>	lol
<Berra>	http://hastebin.com/oquhudepoj.js If you look at the foo.hello declaration, that's valid if it's inside the IIFE, but when it's parsed by closure on its own it's invalid.
<cjohnson>	that's not what concat means
<cjohnson>	concat means jam the two files right up against each other
<cjohnson>	this is like a server side include
<Berra>	Yes, I do that but I put the concat inside that IIFE block
<cjohnson>	well that's weird, don't do that
<cjohnson>	or suffer the consequences of doing weird things
<Berra>	So I concat THEN prinft it inside the IIFE
<cjohnson>	I dunno what else to tell you
<Berra>	It's just so I can categorize and seperate it into files when working, but I want all to be inside the IIFE after compilation
<cjohnson>	yeah. weird
<cjohnson>	if you want to separate the logic, make them standalone modules
<Berra>	Not weird, it's better than having a IIFEE that is several K lines long
<cjohnson>	if you want to separate the logic, make them standalone modules
<inimino>	sometimes I do that too
<cjohnson>	sure, but it's weird. and your tools might not all understand what you're doing
<cjohnson>	so you get erronous warnings
<cjohnson>	in which case you just need to ignore them ;)
<inimino>	yeah
<inimino>	ignore or suppress
<inimino>	or just apply the concat steps before you lint, or whatever
<Berra>	Lowering the verbosity of warnings to default doesn't report anything, but then again I want verbose output, just not related to that one issue.
<cjohnson>	I think you got all the possible solutions ur gonna get
<cjohnson>	suppress, ignore, pre-concat, properly turn your modules into actual modules

<ashnur>	I have to buy a small laptop/netbook to be able to work while on road. Anyone has a suggestion? :)
<ashnur>	right, sorry for asking twice :(
<zone117x>	is it okay to put properties in a prototype?
<zone117x>	I only ever see people put functions in prototypes..
<ashnur>	it's ok
<zone117x>	how come no one does it?
<ashnur>	however, you might not need it
<zone117x>	and if I'm creating tons of objects, isn't it better performance if all the properties are defined in the prototype?
<ashnur>	if those are the same properties and they are never changing, yes, it's better
<zone117x>	in my prototypes I'm enforcing some type safety in the constructor
<Sorella>	zone117x: you can put anything on the prototype that you INTEND TO SHARE WITH ALL OBJECTS INHERITING FROM IT. You can put objects there, but *usually* you don't want to share objects with N other objects.
<inimino>	zone117x: nobody does it because there's little use for a property that's the same on every instance
<Sorella>	>> var a = { xs: [] }; var b = { __proto__: a }; b.xs.push(2); [a.xs, b.xs]

<zone117x>	Typescript isn't an option, and this way is working pretty well for me right now. I have to throw exceptions when types don't match and its helped fix a lot of development bugs already
<zone117x>	I'm only asking if it makes more sense to define the properties in the prototype
<zone117x>	I think either way would work just about the same
<zone117x>	but in the prototype seems like it would take less cycles to initialize
<Sorella>	zone117x: I'd recommend reading about JS's OO model, tbqh. You seem to be misunderstanding the hole of prototypes in JS.
<Sorella>	!oop @ zone117x
<ecmabot>	zone117x: http://robotlolita.me/2011/10/09/understanding-javascript-oop.html summarizes Object Oriented Programming in Javascript, using concepts from ECMAScript 5, and relating them back to older paradigms from ECMAScript 3
<Sorella>	(Though the example I've pasted before shows pretty well why you usually don't want to put objects in the prototype)
<Sorella>	>> var a = { xs: [] }; var b = { __proto__: a }; b.xs.push(2); [a.xs, b.xs]
<ecmabot>	Sorella: (object) [[2], [2]]
<Sorella>	zone117x: I'm curious as to why TypeScript wouldn't be an option though.
<zone117x>	Sorella I understand how to use prototypes in js and I know what I'm doing isn't common, but its perfect for this situation
<zone117x>	its enforcing type safety without a lot of verbose code
<Sorella>	zone117x: it's not about being common or not, it's about whether it does what you want or not
<Sorella>	You can't enforce type safety without a type system D:
<zone117x>	well the example I showed *is* enforcing type safety
<Sorella>	No, it isn't. You're just using the terminology wrong. What you've pasted tries to give a particular shape to an object, but none of that code is type safe.
<Sorella>	A type safe program is one that doesn't give you runtime errors for the properties that the type system have statically checked at compilation time.
<inimino>	oh, that's interesting code
<zone117x>	well for my purpose it forces you to use objects with the same constructor as the defined property which is exactly what I need
<inimino>	for an unusual definition of "type safety"
<Sorella>	(In any case, I'd still recommend either TypeScript or Flow, if you want type safety. Flow has the additional benefit of not needing to provide any type annotation at all)
<zone117x>	and yeah I'm probably using wrong terminology :p
*	Guest96962 is now known as Torkable
<zone117x>	Sorella I'll see if I can use typescript although I doubt it
<inimino>	I don't see you actually testing anything in your code.
<Sorella>	zone117x: there's nothing in JS that forces you to use constructors. I could just as well do `var a = Object.create(Show.prototype); a.ids = []`, and then all your subsequent instantiations would fail
<zone117x>	thats just an example, I've already tested it
<Sorella>	zone117x: TypeScript and Flow are gradual type systems for JS. If you're writing JS, you can use any of those two, without changing anything in your existing code.
<zone117x>	Sorella I understand that
<inimino>	var f = 3 what?
<inimino>	I mean I don't see you actually testing the types.
<zone117x>	inimino sorry debug code left in
<zone117x>	thats where I'd throw in exception
<inimino>	ok
<zone117x>	thisVal.constructor === optVal.constructor
<zone117x>	sorry "type" is probably wrong word here
<zone117x>	the only thing I need is to make sure strings, numbers, dates, arrays, etc must be used for the right properties in the constructor
<inimino>	actually the weirdest thing about that code is that you're using `this` at all
<inimino>	just pass an object that has the properties you want to check for
<inimino>	putting everything on `this` first is just weird
<zone117x>	inimino *thats* the kind of feedback I'm looking for
<zone117x>	so a better way to do this would be defining like a property object
<inimino>	var defaults={...}; handleOptions(options,defaults,this)
<zone117x>	that seems much more javascript-y thanks, I'll probably do that
<inimino>	np
<Torkable>	mmm
<Torkable>	could you use a factory pattern to help with this?
<Torkable>	http://thenodeway.io/posts/designing-factories/
<zone117x>	Torkable does that help do the same enforcement as current method?
<Torkable>	maybe?
<Torkable>	I didn't look at your current code
<zone117x>	Torkable I don't think that factory pattern necessarily helps with that
<Torkable>	k just throwin it out there

<Felishia>	hello!
<Felishia>	does anyone know a mathematical formula input?
<Felishia>	where I use something like I dunno.... LaTeX
<Felishia>	:3
<ezakimak>	latex accepts plain text
<ezakimak>	there's websites w/online latex editing
<Felishia>	yeah but it should be good for the user
<Felishia>	I dunno
<ezakimak>	editing formulas visually is a very difficult problem.
<ezakimak>	use mathematica
<Felishia>	maybe mathjax
<ezakimak>	try the online latex tools
<ezakimak>	offline there's lyx
<Felishia>	uh?
<Felishia>	https://github.com/leathrum/mathjax-ext-contrib/tree/master/forminput

<quetzakubica>	Hey. I'm reading about monads in javascript and it says that EventStream in bacon.js is also a monad. I was reading about bacon.js sometime ago (learning reactive programming) and there was said that EventStream is just an "observable" pattern. So does it mean that Monad is Observable? or Observable is a Monad?
<chruldt>	try katex
<ezakimak>	monad is a very complex, abstract notion, hard to explain succinctly
<GreenJello>	it's like a box
<GreenJello>	!next
<ecmabot>	GreenJello: Another satisfied customer! NEXT!!
<ezakimak>	but is the cat inside dead or alive?
<quetzakubica>	I don't want monad explanation, just to know if observable is close to being a monad?
<Felishia>	:(
<GreenJello>	yes
<ezakimak>	I know, shake it! and see what sounds come out
<ezakimak>	*hear
<GreenJello>	quetzakubica, yeah, it's similar
<Felishia>	ezakimak, what about lyx?
<learns>	How do I nest functions with callbacks depending on the length of an array? Tried to explain it here: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/392f8ee5eb5a8a666350
<quetzakubica>	hmm, Observable pattern is rather easy to understand, yet monad is not. Interesting.
<ezakimak>	it allows visual editing of math formulas
<ezakimak>	this is the best explanation I've seen so far: http://plug.org/pipermail/plug/2013-May/030270.html
<ezakimak>	it's not short.
<quetzakubica>	thanks ezakimak
<quetzakubica>	I'm reading this for now http://sean.voisen.org/blog/2013/10/intro-monads-maybe/
<quetzakubica>	I tend to learn by examples
<zone117x>	inimino you still there?
<zone117x>	this code seems a lot better.. property constructor mismatch for 'seasonCount', provided [object String], required [object Number]
<zone117x>	err.. https://jsfiddle.net/d1tt3q8w/2/
<Torkable>	learns: you can flatten that out with promises
<Torkable>	also why are you putting the objs in an array
<learns>	Torkable, what should I do then? >_>
<Torkable>	use promises?
<learns>	Torkable: I mean the thing about objs in an array.. Can I fix that with promises you say?
<Torkable>	no I'm just commenting on the fact that the array is unused
<asteele>	learns essentially you will need a little recursive function, where you pass it in the array, it pulls the first item off of t and then processes it, then calls itself and passes the array it just modified
<Torkable>	lol wut
<ezakimak>	or don't modify anything
<phutchins>	Anyone know if there is an equivalent of custom attributes in socketio 1.0+?
<Torkable>	no if you're going to use the array
<ezakimak>	just iterate with reduce
<phutchins>	I can't seem to find anything...
<ezakimak>	or map
<Torkable>	just map the request over it and collect with `all`
<Nazral>	I have a contenteditable element and I want to eval the content once in a while
<Nazral>	except it ... well, doesn't work
<learns>	hmm
<Nazral>	I check in the console, the content of innerHTML of my element is "2+2"
<Nazral>	so it should work, but I get a "expected expression, got <" instead

<gambl0re>	which front end framework should i learn for an entry level web developer position?
<gambl0re>	besides jquery.
<ezakimak>	jquery isn't a framework, just a toolbox
<ezakimak>	i'd say learn whatever frameworks the employers you are applying to are using
<ezakimak>	being good at learning itself is key to any position in software development
<ezakimak>	you will never know enough to do your job--every job entails learning more
<Nazral>	ezakimak: thanks
<ezakimak>	and, actually, I wouldn't want a job where I already knew everything I needed to do it. where's the fun in that?
<TKoL>	I've been writing javascript for about 6 months now and surprisingly I still don't know the answer to this question -- hence me coming here -- In Chrome or Firefox, what is the best way of inputting arbitrary functions into a webpage that you don't control the source for, in a way that's debuggable?
<TKoL>	ie that I can set breakpoints for, etc
<TKoL>	I know how to run arbitrary functions from the console, I just don't know how to set breakpoints for them
<ezakimak>	unless the function is in a file you may not be able to "browse" to the function body text in the dev tools
<ezakimak>	*but*, if you set a break point before whatever calls it calls it and step into it, you should be able to step through it
<TKoL>	I'm asking because I'm working on a bookmarklet to add functionality to the admin section of a popular system
<ezakimak>	have you googled it? the 1st google hit to the SO question has a solution
<TKoL>	The thing that calls it is itself not going to be in a file
<TKoL>	I did try to google it, I found the answer of putting 'debugger;' into the function
<ezakimak>	"how to debug bookmarklet"
<TKoL>	and i tried that in firefox console and that didn't actually create a breakpoint for me
<gambl0re>	which is more widely used, backbone or angular
<ezakimak>	angular I hope
<ezakimak>	although I don't prefer either
<gambl0re>	.
<TKoL>	oh, i will try that solution that you pointed to ezakimak, thanks
<ezakimak>	ljharb, can we add a lmgtfy function to ecmabot?
<inimino>	ezakimak: it's not a feature that should be frequently used, so I'd probably say no
<TKoL>	As someone who's a bit of a perfectionist and wants to learn how to do things the right way, I'd like it if someone could read a blog post I wrote about something I'm doing in JAvascript and give me some feedback
<ezakimak>	we use it all the time in this channel
<TKoL>	is anybody down for that?
<TKoL>	http://flanneljesus.github.io/programming/2015-05-15/shopify-bulk-301-redirect/
<ezakimak>	inimino, I agree, it *shouldn't* be frequently used, but unfortunately it most likely will be
<inimino>	there's !g which is the same thing minus the snark
<inimino>	zone117x: you could also use typeof instead of treating everything like objects
<ezakimak>	sometimes the snark is important feedback
<ezakimak>	instilling the point that to be a good developer you need to be resourceful
<TKoL>	well ezakimak, my problem isn't fully solved anyway
<ezakimak>	the fact that someone has found this irc channel is a good sign that they are willing
<TKoL>	so the snark shut me up but left me with an unsolved problem
<zone117x>	inimino typeof(new Date(NaN)) === "object"
<TKoL>	I still don't know how to debug arbitrary javascript I might want to put into a page, I only know how to debug bookmarklets
<inimino>	zone117x: yes, but not everything in JavaScript is an object
<TKoL>	I'd rather know how to debug arbitrary javascript input at will
<ezakimak>	why are you running this on the page? can't you just use the API from node and do it all once?
<TKoL>	I'm going to do it on the page because it's going to be a bookmarklet
<TKoL>	not on a server
<ezakimak>	well, if it works from node first, then you just need to transport it to working in a bookmarklet context
<TKoL>	also, I don't know much about the API, so I don't know how to authenticate outside of a page
<ezakimak>	that's one way to do it
<TKoL>	inside of a page, you don't need to authenticate
<inimino>	js> 4..constructor == (new Number(4)).constructor // true, but the second thing is definitely not what you want
<ecmabot>	inimino: (boolean) true
<inimino>	zone117x: ^
<ezakimak>	ok, so do it first as a regular js script, then move it to a bookmarklet context
<TKoL>	that's what I'm doing
<zone117x>	inimino what do you mean?
<TKoL>	but I need to know how to debug arbitrary javascript inside devtools still
<ezakimak>	any js from a *file* is easy to debug w/devtools
<inimino>	zone117x: "".constructor==String is not the test you're looking for
<inimino>	zone117x: you want typeof("")=='string'
<TKoL>	and you can execute that *file* within the context of another page?
<ezakimak>	yes
<ezakimak>	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15344847/debugging-bookmarklets-in-firefox
<TKoL>	well i promise i will google how before asking anything else
<ezakimak>	is that the one you tried?
<zone117x>	inimino typeof only works for base javascript types
<inimino>	zone117x: you don't want to accept wrapped objects, not that there are likely to be any in your code
<TKoL>	ezakimak that's the page i found, i'm half way into trying it
<inimino>	zone117x: so if both typeof's are object, then you can do your .constructor comparison
<TKoL>	is there a way to point to a local file that's NOT on a locally hosted server?
<TKoL>	eg just in your file system?
<ezakimak>	it's basically saying put your stuff into a local file and load it from there so that devtools will work with it easily
<zone117x>	inimino is there anything wrong with only comparing constructor?
<ezakimak>	you could point it to a file:// url--but you'll probably need to change a flag under about:config first to allow permissions
<inimino>	zone117x: apart from what I just demonstrated about wrapped objects?
<ezakimak>	running a local server is often easier
<ezakimak>	and safer
<inimino>	zone117x: most JS values are actually going to be primitives, and by coercing to Object and then checking the constructor, you're actually not doing what you want
<TKoL>	ok well at the moment it's easy enough for me to run a local server (I've got a jekyll blog I can easily run) but I'm often in environments where that would be a PITA
<zone117x>	inimino can you jsfiddle the bug you're explaining? I don't see it from your examples
<inimino>	zone117x: what you want is a primitive of the correct type, and primitives don't have a .constructor because they are not objects
<inimino>	zone117x: are you familiar with wrapper objects like new Number()?
<inimino>	zone117x: the basic problem is that you're treating JS like a language where everything is an object, and it's not
<zone117x>	inimino I don't think I am familiar with it
<inimino>	var x=4; 4.constructor // there is no constructor property on 4, because it's not an object, so this creates an object, and checks the constructor property on it
<inimino>	var x=new Number(4) // this actually is an object, is absolutely not what you want, and also passes your constructor test
<inimino>	zone117x: it should be x.constructor in the example above
<learns>	ezakimak: I don't think I can iterate with map or reduce? Because the functions need to be nested..
<zone117x>	inimino anything wrong with coercing primitives to wrapped objects?
<ezakimak>	what needs to be nested?
<inimino>	zone117x: it's not a major problem, but what you've written isn't really aligned with how types work in JS
<ezakimak>	where's your paste?
<singularity_1>	Hello, could kindly tell me which IDE is good to start to program in JS? :) thank you
<inimino>	zone117x: if someone passes a wrapped object, then your typechecking will pass and your code after that will break
<ezakimak>	zone117x, there's a reason the feature exists
<inimino>	zone117x: that's unlikely, but the way with typeof first is still the right way
<learns>	ezakimak: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/392f8ee5eb5a8a666350
<pi->	singularity_1: have a look at "chrome developer tools" -- it's pretty decent.
<zone117x>	inimino but aren't wrapped objects treated the same?
<inimino>	no
<inimino>	that's why they're almost never seen
<zone117x>	is it just because of the performance overhead?
<zone117x>	besides that whats wrong?
<zone117x>	I'll add the typeof check as well for performance reasons
<inimino>	no, wrapped objects are a fundamentally different thing
<singularity_1>	pi- thank you
<ezakimak>	wrapped objects are *objects*
<inimino>	it's not for performance reasons, it's just wrong to use wrapped objects where a primitive is expected
<ezakimak>	there are no operations defined for them like add, subtract, concat, etc.
<zone117x>	oh what the hell, I didn't know they behaved like that
<zone117x>	thanks for the advice, I'll get it fixed
<raypulver>	>> new Number(1) + new Number(1)

<tejasmanohar>	hey
<tejasmanohar>	has anyone here worked with optimizely + @media / responsive design?
<ezakimak>	that's because + attempts to convert the type
<tejasmanohar>	im feeling like their editor is quite challenging to work with when your code already has responsive mechanisms...
<learns>	ezakimak: you don't know the solution? :(
<latestbot>	I have been looking over ‘call’ & ‘apply’ from a long time now but I have never been able to see any real world use case, especially while developing a web app. Can anyone explain why these are useful? I understand these two are used to change the ‘this’ context in a function.
<inimino>	latestbot: that's not the primary use
<tejasmanohar>	anyone know a good alternative? library or SaaS
<ezakimak>	learns, I'm thinking on it
<inimino>	latestbot: how would you call a function with arguments that you have in variables?
<TKoL>	latestbot you can use apply and/or call (I forget, probably both) to send the entire list of arguments of the current function to some other function
<TKoL>	which helps you create wrapper functions
<ezakimak>	learns, is there more happening in the callback? because in your gist none of the data is actually used
<ezakimak>	from your gist it looks just like it's a matter of sequencing
<TKoL>	eg if I have some function x, and some function y, and I decide that on some point in my code I want a way to make a function that does z but then calls x, or another function that does z but then calls y, I can define a wrapper function
<TKoL>	and regardless of what arguments x or y take, my wrapper function can do z and then pass on the arguments
<TKoL>	by using call or apply
<zone117x>	inimino improved type checking.. https://jsfiddle.net/d1tt3q8w/3/
*	Torkable is now known as Guest15083
<zone117x>	code is much better now, thank you
<learns>	ezakimak: I'm trying to loop through an array and depending on the length more functions will be nested.. The callbacks are returning something..
<latestbot>	TKoL: Hmm, It’s a lot to digest :p
<inimino>	zone117x: sure
<latestbot>	So basically call & apply are mainly used in libraries?
<TKoL>	I've found situations where I need wrapper functions quite a lot
<ezakimak>	learns, what is using the resulting data?
<ezakimak>	zone117x, are you simply trying to clone the object?
<Zlepper>	A oneliner to keep the last x elements in an array?
<ezakimak>	define keep
<TKoL>	eg a website I made where, on the vast majority of pages, I need to call x() in response to some event, but the on only 1 page, I need to respond to that event by doing some other stuff, and then calling x()
<TKoL>	but I still want to do that whole shebang by calling x()
<learns>	ezakimak: I'm going to print it out the data and that should be in sequence.. But map won't do because it's async..
<latestbot>	TKoL: I think I need to dig more deeper about this, phew
<GreenJello>	Zlepper, xs.slice(-n)
<TKoL>	I forgot the difference between call and apply, and in that particular wrapper function I didn't actually need it, because I knew all the arguments
<Zlepper>	Thanks
<inimino>	zone117x: if you want to refactor further, you could create a function type(value) that returns either a primitive type or a constructor name
<TKoL>	but if you need a wrapper function for which you don't know all the arguments, call and/or apply are your friends
<latestbot>	That feeling when you know you enough but you stumble upon things like this, ahh
<latestbot>	What’s the use of wrapper functions?
<TKoL>	well, in my example, I'll just be explicit
<inimino>	zone117x: then your logic inside that loop reduces too if(type(a) != type(b)) throw new Error('expected ...
<TKoL>	on my entire ecommerce site, I had a function called updateCart()
<TKoL>	which took a 'cart' object as an argument, and updated some things on the page
<TKoL>	based on that 'cart' argument
<zone117x>	inimino good idea, thx
<TKoL>	that updateCart() function was perfectly fine as it was on every single page, except 1 page
<GreenJello>	throw new TypeError('...')
<zone117x>	ezakimak no not a clone, just some basic type safety
<TKoL>	on that 1 page, I needed updateCart() to do everything it did before, AND to do some other stuff
<latestbot>	you needed to add more functionality to update cart basically?
<TKoL>	yes, while keeping the existing functionality
<TKoL>	javascript provides a really clever way to call the old version of a function after assigning the variable to a different functiuon
<TKoL>	the variable that used to refer to that old function*
<TKoL>	but I hacked that together prior to ever even reading any literature or best practices in Javascript, so I'm just waiting for someone to tell me I did it the wrong way
<TKoL>	dunno if you should trust me :P
<TKoL>	I'm still a bit fresh to it all
<latestbot>	Heck I am too
<learns>	ezakimak: curry maybe?
<TKoL>	updateCart = (function(oldUpdateCart){ oldUpdateCart(arguments); newFunctionality(); })(updateCart)
<TKoL>	that's my pattern for redefining updateCart
<inimino>	zone117x: http://boshi.inimino.org/3box/nl/nl.html#f=/3box/shell/src/types.js&ll=39
<GreenJello>	TKoL the problem is that it's not reversable
<latestbot>	But thing is I don’t know if I am gonna use of all these concepsts
<latestbot>	*concepts
<GreenJello>	why not just create a new function that calls updateCart and does some other things also?
<TKoL>	GreenJello I didn't need reversability
<ezakimak>	learns, https://gist.github.com/NickLeippe/096c7859404591551692
<ezakimak>	you just chain the promises
<TKoL>	GreenJello because the function that was calling updateCart *had* to call updateCart()
<beaky>	does js have something like csharp null coalesce
<GreenJello>	TKoL why?
<ezakimak>	reduce the array, for each item you call request() with that item--but from the previous promise's then handler
<TKoL>	I'm not really sure
<GreenJello>	if (condition) updateCart() else updateCartAndMore()
<ezakimak>	zone117x, define type safety?
<ezakimak>	are you validating data?
<learns>	ezakimak: well, need to learn promises then :( thank you
<TKoL>	I think what happened was I had used updateCart() in so many different places that...I was tied to that function call
<TKoL>	It was easier to redefine updateCart when I needed to (which was just on one page) than to change how it was called in all those places
<TKoL>	so I chose the path of least resistance
<inimino>	zone117x: something like that, but of course handling different kinds of objects
<ezakimak>	learns, you can tack a .then() onto the result of reduce to handle the result from the last request
<inimino>	TKoL: you can also just use another variable to hold the old value
<TKoL>	learns, don't be sad about learning promises :D they're really good
<TKoL>	they enable a lot of patterns that are annoying to do with callbacks
<TKoL>	inimino indeed ; if I needed it to be reversible I would have done that
<TKoL>	I was in a fairly simple situation where it needed to one thing on nearly every page, and it needed to do that one thing plus something else on just this one page
<learns>	TKoL: I've heard they are slow.. And I hate slow things :( I would rather use generators or something but I don't know that either ;(
<Guest15083>	because generators are super fast lulz
<TKoL>	learns slow is relative
<TKoL>	if something takes 35.1 seconds instead of 35...idk, I'd sacrifice .1 seconds for more readable, maintainable code
<TKoL>	I like promises for the way you can catch errors, and for the Promises.all functionality, and of course all that chaining
<Exagone313>	Hello, I try to set up a video reader for a rtmp stream. I tried video.js and Flowplayer, but I can't figure how to show a offline image when the stream stops. Apparently, there is no event triggered for that. Any clue?
<GreenJello>	and if something takes 0.000001s instead of 0.0000001s, is it that big of a deal?
<learns>	TKol: I see :(
<GreenJello>	in other words, A 10x SPEED UP
<TKoL>	of course, speed is a big deal sometimes. .1 seconds is a big deal sometimes, .000001s is a big deal sometimes
<TKoL>	If you're writing code for graphics, or for ...idk... fighter jets, then speed is everything
<Guest15083>	javascript for fighter jets
<Guest15083>	hah
<TKoL>	:)
<TKoL>	exactly my point
<ezakimak>	learns, promises are not slow

<GreenJello>	I remember my curry phase... I curried everything
<ezakimak>	so tasty
<ezakimak>	any comments on that gist for learns? I think it came out pretty clean
<ezakimak>	of course, curry and ajax aren't native--he'll need to replace with from a library of his choice
<learns>	lodash >___________>
<ezakimak>	I vote for rambda
<learns>	._.
<learns>	wat
<ezakimak>	ramda > lodash
<GreenJello>	deferred are generally considered an antipattern
<Guest15083>	ezakimak: if you already have all the options, you can map and perform the reqs in parallel
<Guest15083>	reduce will do them in serial
*	Guest15083 is now known as Torkable
<ezakimak>	they are dependent according to learns original problem statement
<ezakimak>	must be serialized
<Torkable>	ok
<beaky>	if oop and inheritance is bad why does every single js framework out there use it
<GreenJello>	ezakimak, btw, lines 5 and 6 could be: var p = Promise.resolve();
<ezakimak>	reduce can also be made to do it in parallel just as easily
<ezakimak>	depends on your library of course, but yes
<ezakimak>	they could be removed entirely then and just inserted into line 20
<GreenJello>	when in doubt, assume es6 promises, which most libraries are supersets of
<GreenJello>	the exception being jQuery, of course, because... jQuery does what it wants :-)
<doug16k__>	beaky, you name it, someone will tell you it is bad. does it solve the problem? did it take a reasonable amount of time? can other devs read it? if so, it is fine
<ezakimak>	https://gist.github.com/NickLeippe/096c7859404591551692
<learns>	Is this better than jquery? https://github.com/ugma/ugma
<preaction>	learns: does it do what you want?
<inimino>	zone117x: looks better
<ezakimak>	why do you even need it?
<GreenJello>	learns, jQuery is good for dom manipulation, it's all of the extra stuff it doesn't do well
<GreenJello>	like ajax, promises, and those weird utility functions like $.each
<ezakimak>	"no documentation" could be a red flag
<learns>	preaction: never used it, I just want to confirm that it's somewhat decent. I know the guy that made it >_>
<doug16k__>	learns, does it have .closest() ? if not, it's crap
<ezakimak>	lots of little dom utility libs on microjs.com
<preaction>	learns: so ask the guy that made it. it's "decent" if it does what you want.
<doug16k__>	.closest is probably the most useful thing in jquery
<GreenJello>	learns, so jQuery, superagent, bluebird, and either just JS or lodash for the weird utility functions is a pretty normal combination
<inimino>	zone117x: the last thing I would suggest is put the {}.toString.call on line 5 in your getType() function, so it always returns a string
<learns>	GreenJello: I see..
<inimino>	zone117x: then you can change line 38 to just use propType and optType in the error message

<cjohnson>	hagb4rd: just because it has some features that you believe should be in a bot doens't mean it's making a difference
<cjohnson>	like I said, I haven't seen one person legitimately use it
<cjohnson>	only be annoyed by it responding erroneously
<cjohnson>	so yeah, it's unnecessary. but I don't care now that you've at least fixed it to be less annoying
<cjohnson>	personally I think those things don't really belong in a n IRC bot -- for anything more than a one or two liner, that's what jsfiddle is for. it provides all of that and more
<zone117x>	inimino what if you have same function name in two different scopes
<inimino>	zone117x: then it will break, yes
<inimino>	zone117x: that's a judgement call, whether you want to support that kind of case
<hagb4rd>	*sigh* ..is it full moon today? ..not becauswe of you now cj.. trying to cheer it up.. but folks seem to be kind of stressed.. and i'm rbasically running out of leeches
<inimino>	zone117x: there's also things like objects from different realms, where .constructor won't be equal even though it "should" be, so we have things like Array.isArray
<GreenJello>	leeches? they always suck the fun out of everything
<cjohnson>	I'm in a pretty good mood, I just went for a nice long ride :)
<GreenJello>	not sure how that'd help
<hagb4rd>	lol
<zone117x>	inimino yeah this code doesn't really handle arrays
<zone117x>	I have some string arrays but it doesn't enforce the content at all
<zone117x>	suppose I could add array with a single child in the property definition
<zone117x>	to compare options against
<ezakimak>	but a good leeching can cure some diseases...
<inimino>	zone117x: if you get an array from a different browser context, like an iframe, then the constructor will actually be a different Array object
<zone117x>	inimino ahh I see, this is a node.js server app so should be okay
<inimino>	zone117x: so, comparing strings in that case will give the right answer, where comparing constructors won't

<emunah>	how much javascript do i need to know in order to create dynamic web applications? can it be quantified? Should i read a book on the whole language?
<ezakimak>	it would help
<ezakimak>	!books
<ecmabot>	ezakimak: !eloquent (eloquentjavascript.net), JavaScript: The Definitive Guide by David Flanagan, High Performance JavaScript by Nicholas C. Zakas, Effective JavaScript by David Herman, Functional JavaScript by Michael Fogus, Programming JavaScript Applications (ericelliottjs.com/product/programming-javascript-applications-paper-ebook-bundle/)
<GreenJello>	emunah, the language is only part of it
<ezakimak>	there are also libraries, the dom api, and understanding event programming
<GreenJello>	but depending on the requirements, you can get by reading eloquent, some google-fu, and jQuery
<ezakimak>	and knowing good resources--eg mdn, caniuse.com, microjs.com, and of course here
<ezakimak>	oh, and html5rocks is excellent also
<dostoyevsky>	emunah: just look at some codepen.io pages and copy&paste what you need :)
<ezakimak>	oh god
<GreenJello>	copy and paste is 95% of starting out and trying to be productive
<ezakimak>	yah, that's how the entire php ecosystem grew. unfortunately the copy sources were terrible, so multiplication of error and very bad practices ensued
<dostoyevsky>	if it doesn't work come here and ask questions :)
<cjohnson>	that's all programming
<cjohnson>	the point is you eventually learn the code you're copying
<ezakimak>	no, it's not.
<cjohnson>	lol.
<ezakimak>	far better, imo, to try to code it first yourself
<dostoyevsky>	cjohnson: I think it's called brogramming
<TKoL>	emunah are you already a programmer?
<cjohnson>	you vastly overestimate the majority of people programming in the world
<ezakimak>	then once you're at the point where you *could* code it yourself, then save time by reusing other people's stuff--becuse by then you've developed the ability to tell whether it really does what you need, why not, or is it poor code
<emunah>	TKol, yes somewhat, i've written java to do some simple production tasks
<preaction>	dostoyevsky: no. brogramming requires ruby, and a "better than everyone" attitude that does not _allow_ you to copy or even use someone else's code
<cjohnson>	you start copying, thne you copy and modify, then you start seeing the pattern and writing your own take, and eventually you're coming up with your own approaches
<TKoL>	emunah I created an online version of a boardgame I liked without having really read anything but some blogposts on Javascript
<preaction>	copy/paste programming is like stage 2 in the 5 stages of a developer's career
<TKoL>	but I had prior experience with Python
<ezakimak>	maybe these days.
<ezakimak>	not how I learned.
<GreenJello>	preaction, copy/paste is forever
<preaction>	GreenJello: eventually you start calling it "refactoring"
<GreenJello>	if you don't copy and paste, you work at an academic institute
<ezakimak>	i learned every language I know from manuals, textbooks, and specs
<cjohnson>	primarily through examples, yes?
<GreenJello>	I've moved on to only copy/pasting 40% of my code from stackoverflow questions
<cjohnson>	littered throughout them
<GreenJello>	30% is probably the lowest it'll ever get, and I'm cool with that
<ezakimak>	i've never c&p'd a solution I didn't understand
<emunah>	am I correct in understand that a constructur is a function in which the "this" keyword is being used?
<cjohnson>	any function may have this
<preaction>	emunah: "this" can be used anywhere
<ezakimak>	and probably only ever c&p'd maybe 1/2 a % of anything
<GreenJello>	emunah, the term is weird, but it's a function that you're supposed to call with `new`
<GreenJello>	new Constructor, vs notConstructor()
<GreenJello>	emunah, other functions use `this`
<ezakimak>	any function can be used as a ctor, not all are intended to be though, of course
<emunah>	preaction: so there is no difference between a function and constructor except a logical one for what you intended it to do
<ezakimak>	yes
<GreenJello>	exactly
<preaction>	emunah: correct. any function is a constructor if you use new
<preaction>	whether that makes any sense is where a function starts to look like a constructor
<ezakimak>	most textbooks have you create programs before showing you the solution
<ezakimak>	you learn better by having to apply a concept and work it out first
<preaction>	maybe you do
<ezakimak>	it's a different kind of thinking than regurtating an answer from a list of packaged solutions
<TKoL>	is it wrong that I don't know how to do most DOM stuff without jquery?
<preaction>	ooh, how condescending are we going to get? also, can you at least spell right when condescending?
<ezakimak>	*regurgitating
<ezakimak>	how is it condescending?
<preaction>	TKoL: no
<TKoL>	I'd like to one day be able to use, eg, querySelectorAll for my needs and just iterate over the returned elements to do...whatever I need to do
<TKoL>	but maybe that's a stupid goal and jquery is...good enough?
<ezakimak>	http://the-programmers-stone.com/the-original-talks/day-1-thinking-about-thinking/
<preaction>	ezakimak: the use of regurgitating, which is a disgusting bodily function, gives a disgusting connotation to "answer from a list of packaged solutions"
<ezakimak>	regurgitation is a key biological function for the survival of avian species younglings.
<ezakimak>	that you feel it is disgusting is subjective
<cjohnson>	thus you see why I lose interest preaction :P
<TKoL>	*god i hate programming on windows* trying to call 'jekyll serve --watch' and it won't work, have to update to new Ruby, have to install new Development kit
<TKoL>	didn't have these problems on my trusty macbook
<cjohnson>	linux vm TKoL!
<preaction>	TKoL: i have $work, where i Get Shit Done, and so use jquery and all kinds of things, and then i have $home, where i learn new things when i want. at $work, i chose bootstrap. i might not choose it again, but i won't rewrite all my work stuff because bootstrap is slightly unpopular
<TKoL>	my computer is too crap to run a linux vm
<cjohnson>	ssh onto it and do your work in terminal
<TKoL>	i tried to install ElementaryOS recently
<cjohnson>	headless linux vm
<cjohnson>	shouldn't use much
<TKoL>	it ran so slow
<cjohnson>	AndLinux have you heard of that?
<TKoL>	no what's that?
<TKoL>	lmgt
<cjohnson>	it's a prepackaged headless vm thing for windows... super light weight
<dostoyevsky>	preaction: why is bootstrap unpopular?
<cjohnson>	you get to run a linux terminal in your windows desktop basically
<ezakimak>	#css afficionados (gurus) find bootstrap problematic for many various reasons
<rcyr>	As much as I _HATE_ bootstrap, it's really popular.
<rcyr>	It's more or less the jQuery of the CSS so-called frameworks
<cjohnson>	it's mostly just oversized for most applications. but it is fairly good for what it's for
<TKoL>	AndLinux says it only runs on 32 bit windows
<ezakimak>	mostly because for people that aren't true #css gurus, it lets them get shit done quickly
<preaction>	dostoyevsky: many people believe that bootstrap is too big, or too poorly-organized, or requires too much markup, or too ugly
<GreenJello>	bootstrap could be better if they made it more modular and eliminated the tag based styles by default
<rcyr>	GreenJello: You're alive!
<cjohnson>	it is modular though, that's the thing that a lot of people don't realize
<cjohnson>	you just remove the @imports for the bits you don't want
<cjohnson>	it's pretty well organized
<GreenJello>	rcyr, that's what the doctor says :-)
<TKoL>	I only like bootstrap for the Typography, Buttons, etc
<TKoL>	not the grid
<preaction>	sure, because most people don't actually read the docs that say "here's how you remove stuff you don't want, and here's a webapp that lets you click a button to remove something you don't want"
<TKoL>	the grid is too constraining
<TKoL>	learn flexbox
<cjohnson>	TKoL: I would just run a headless linux vm though
<dostoyevsky>	ezakimak: Has sass a better reputation with css affictionados?
<cjohnson>	different thing entirely
<emunah>	TKoL, I found nothing constraining about the grid
<ezakimak>	well, that's probably just subjective. i've seen some admit that sass does save some typing and allow reuse (which is why I like it)
<rcyr>	dostoyevsky: You're comparing oranges to apples
<cjohnson>	it's a little verbose. if you just use it straight out of the box
<TKoL>	emunah perhaps constraining isn't the right word
<TKoL>	i suppose what i mean is, it doesn't accomplish anything that can't be accomplished better without it
<cjohnson>	you can fairly easy start adding your own semantic applicator classes if you're using less/sass
<dostoyevsky>	rcyr: sass is not really just a better css?
<rcyr>	dostoyevsky:  _EVERYONE_ should use a CSS preprocessor.
<dostoyevsky>	or tries to be
<ezakimak>	so very many alternatives to bootstrap: http://usablica.github.io/front-end-frameworks/compare.html
<GreenJello>	haven't you heard? inline styles are all the rage now
<cjohnson>	dostoyevsky: bootstrap is a CSS framework. SASS is a language the compiles to CSS
<emunah>	preaction: so if all functions have a this, then what does "this" refer to if I call a function without the "new" keyword
<cjohnson>	different purposes
<cjohnson>	!this @ emunah
<ecmabot>	emunah: If a function call is of the form `a.b()`, `this` will be the object you accessed the "b" property from. Otherwise, if it's of the form `a()`, `this` will be `undefined`, which is turned into the global object if the function isn't in strict mode. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/08/30/understanding-javascripts-this/
<TKoL>	the good thing about bootstrap is not just how quickly you can get something running, it's also the pre-existing themes
<ezakimak>	sass lets you set variable in one place, eg $myfav_bg_color = 'red'; and not have to search&replace every time you want to change it
<TKoL>	which may get some people very close to what they're after
<preaction>	and then people use it to set $black = "0x333"
<TKoL>	but all that markup in the html
<TKoL>	it ties ya down
<rcyr>	dostoyevsky: Bootstrap is a set of arguably reusable CSS rules. SASS is more or less "CSS with some additions" to make CSS more DRY. For example, Bootstrap itself uses a CSS preprocessor called LESS.
<cjohnson>	like I was just saying TKoL it's very easy if you use the less/sass source to quickly write your semantic wrappers to avoid all that markup
<ezakimak>	i think it's silly to have to add a bajillion classes to every little dom node in your html to style things
<emunah>	ecmabot: one more stupid question, is javascript in the browser in strict mode?
<cjohnson>	you just mix in the row class onto the elements that wrap your columns
<ezakimak>	'btn' to every <button>, really? lame.
<rcyr>	emunah: No, and ecmabot is a IRC bot, not a human.
<preaction>	emunah: ecmabot is a bot. and no
<TKoL>	I used the bootstrap version that ties into compass once, but I never got into it enough to make it fully semantic
<ezakimak>	kinda defeats the purpose of semantic markup
<ezakimak>	if you have to declare every semantic *twice*
<cjohnson>	once you take an afternoon and do that, you really clear up al ot of the pointless extra markup in your html
<cjohnson>	you can just mix .btn in on button automatically, for instance
<cjohnson>	it's just a *framework*
<TKoL>	but doesn't that make it hard / impossible to update to new bootstrap vesrions?
<emunah>	so in the browser if i call a function that uses "this" keyword without invoking it with "new" the property that is being set on "this" will become a member of the window object?
<TKoL>	are you even supposed to update bootstrap?
<rcyr>	I'm pretty extreme about this... I see every single div/span as a defeat.
<TKoL>	it doesn't seem very updateable
<cjohnson>	no TKoL that's why you use sass
<cjohnson>	you use mixins
<ezakimak>	emunah, read that entry again
<cjohnson>	their CSS remains untouched
<TKoL>	i have a question cjohnson, about that
<TKoL>	but i have to word it right, give me a sec
<cjohnson>	but, people take bootstrap out of the box and use it on production and assume "well shit this sucks"
<cjohnson>	because they forgot to finish the job
<cjohnson>	sure TKoL
<TKoL>	can you extend / mixin, say, the 'btn' class WITHOUT having the 'btn' selector in your final output css?
<ezakimak>	likewise with resets. you're not supposed to just drop them in untouched--you're supposed to edit them
<cjohnson>	basically it copies the rules from the .btn class onto whatever you're mixing it onto
<emunah>	ezakimak: ecmabot said it would become a global object if javascript is not in strict mode. I assume that the property would become apart of the window object.
<TKoL>	but do you have to have the .btn styles also in the finalized css?
<ezakimak>	emunah, the very first sentence
<TKoL>	or can you copy those rules without also having .btn in your final css?
<cjohnson>	depends how you write it TKoL. you could just have the rules defined as a sass-only thing
<TKoL>	because that's what i would want
<cjohnson>	yeah that's easy
<cjohnson>	check out scss
<ace_me>	I owuld like to load in a iframe a site which is not mine, and there to allow user to click on a element and I should get back the css selector or xpath ! Is this possible ?
<TKoL>	i would want to extend / mixin .btn, but not actually see '.btn' in my output css file
<cjohnson>	that's the one I prefer because it has syntax that looks like real css
<rcyr>	(When we say SASS, we really mean the SCSS syntax of SASS...)
<ezakimak>	ace_me, pretty sure security may prevent you from doing that
<cjohnson>	TKoL: yep
<rcyr>	The classic SASS syntax is pretty bad
<TKoL>	i know about scss, i've used it and I know how to extend and mixin, but I've only extended and mixed in in a way that left the prior classes in there
<ace_me>	yes ezakimak
<TKoL>	eg @import bootstrap; button {@mixin .btn;}
<TKoL>	that would have button inherit the styles of .btn, but also... .btn would still be in the css
<cjohnson>	see mixins TKoL http://sass-lang.com/guide
<TKoL>	which would be worse than useless to me
<cjohnson>	this "border-radius" doesn't exist as a thing outside the scss
<rcyr>	I'll personally never get Bootstrap because of how easy it is to write layouts once you actually know CSS.
<ezakimak>	why is that bad?
<cjohnson>	it's just a template for applying to actual css rules
<ace_me>	so if I want the user to show me the xpath element where he have a certain <p> for example I will have to ask him to get it with something else then input in a text on a form in order to let me know that ? ezakimak
<ace_me>	?
<ace_me>	no other elegant way ?
<cjohnson>	rcyr: it's a standardized way, that's the point
<rcyr>	cjohnson: CSS is not standard enough for you?
<ezakimak>	i'm not sure how you can communicate between frames loaded from different domains
<dostoyevsky>	Is Modernizr.js another thing everyone should use?
<cjohnson>	I work in an IT dept of 15 and we all have to write consistently styled things across multiple systems and sites
<TKoL>	rcyr what about for the non-layout elements of bootstrap?
<TKoL>	eg button groups, tooltip hovers, etc
<TKoL>	accordian
<cjohnson>	so we standardize. we considered coming up with our own standard from scratch, but bootstrap's goals mostly aligned with our own
<ezakimak>	ace_me, i'm sure there are means of doing it
<cjohnson>	and then, free lunch
<cjohnson>	so why not
<ace_me>	yes but I am not finding one yet ezakimak
<rcyr>	TKoL: There's even less reasons to use them...  Most of them, you want to rewrite them to better suit your website theme... and things like accordions, you can 1) make them yourself or 2) Just pick a lib that does it
<cjohnson>	somebody can write a date/time picker that works with bootstrap out of the box and I can plug it in to my site and is automatically themed to match
<rcyr>	cjohnson: It never works like that in practice... except when you don't care about the design, perhaps for the admin section of a website?
<cjohnson>	It has for me and the devs I maintain
<TKoL>	rcyr i might be a bit weird, but I just fantasize about a really stripped down bootstrap ( which is probably very possible using the sass version of it ) that you get good defaults for out of the box
<TKoL>	but no grid
<cjohnson>	across the hundreds of sites I've seen them build
<TKoL>	i just don't like the grid
<ezakimak>	ace_me, do you control the page in the iframe?
<ace_me>	no
<TKoL>	i like the typography, buttons, and some other stuff
<ezakimak>	then no, you can't do it. security.
<ace_me>	the page is yours and you show me some elements which I later process on my site
<ezakimak>	an iframe can talk to the parent frame, but not the other way around
<Stalkr_>	I'm trying to replace a div with images. Is it possible to listen for when all images (I downloading 12) are done loading and inserted to the page?
<preaction>	same origin still applies
<dostoyevsky>	any opinions on meteor.js ?
<Stalkr_>	$('.photos').load(//) doesn't work for me
<ezakimak>	ace_me, if you can get them to put code on their page you can do it
<dostoyevsky>	Stalkr_: yes
<ace_me>	what kind of code ?
<cjohnson>	Stalkr_: I believe you can use $.when to group a bunch of events together
<ezakimak>	code that talks to the parent
<GreenJello>	dostoyevsky, it's very... all or nothing
<dostoyevsky>	Stalkr_: you need to use img instead of div though
<cjohnson>	the $.when() would be a jquery deferred which returns when all the deferreds you passed to it complete
<dostoyevsky>	Stalkr_: there is img.onload
<Stalkr_>	dostoyevsky: I need to check when all 12 are done though
<ace_me>	ok I will think about that... anyhow is a agreeement... :)
<rcyr>	cjohnson: Working for a website "wordpress-like" sweatshop? That would explain the hundreds :/
<ezakimak>	similar to promises all()
<ace_me>	thz ezakimak
<dostoyevsky>	Stalkr_: just use a global variable and count...
<cjohnson>	rcyr: nope not even close
<Stalkr_>	cjohnson: Not sure how I would use when for it
<GreenJello>	dostoyevsky, have you ever started with plumbing tools to fix a toilet and then your boss goes "Hey, actually we need you to refurnish the couch", but you'd have to get rid of your existing tools and start from scratch?
<GreenJello>	dostoyevsky, that's meteor and stuff like it
<dostoyevsky>	GreenJello: and in the end you have a new house... and your stuff from the old house has just disappeared completely
<GreenJello>	exactly, and that's fine, but it's the difference between replacing parts, and replacing everything to make a change
<cjohnson>	rcyr: I'm just saying... sounds like a lot of your complaints are because you took bootstrap out of the box and said "ok this is all I need now" and htat's just silly
<emunah>	"this" keyword is like loki, it's very tricky
<dostoyevsky>	and then you want to go to the toilet and you get an error... so you buy a new house and live there instead
<cjohnson>	or you used it on a tiny little web app where it's entirely unnecessary
<GreenJello>	example of a change: your company scales and mongo doesn't work out for you
<GreenJello>	*shrug* time to throw out literally all of your code
<cjohnson>	rcyr: it's pretty easy to take the pieces out you aren't using, it's codebase is rather modular. so if you think a piece is unnecessary and your own works better...remove it. if you don't like all the markup in your html...write some semantic css and mix in the row/column classes
<cjohnson>	it's a starting point
<beaky>	can let/const in closures access outer scope
<rcyr>	cjohnson: I just believe that a good starting point is just "normalize.css" and then you simply use floats (or flexbox if you can) to create your layout
<rcyr>	beaky: Yes, of course :)
<ace_me>	ezakimak I would need then to provide a script which attach an event for onclick in the iframe url but maybe I need to check a url parameter if is present ?
<ezakimak>	i don't know the entire scope of your problem domain
<ace_me>	so if I load www.domain.com...&myaparam=true ... then the onclick should call the parent.... function in iframe ezakimak
<beaky>	is const like c++ const or is it more like java final
<ezakimak>	you could do it that way, yes
<ace_me>	;) thx
<ezakimak>	or simply have the code test to see if it is in an iframe
<ezakimak>	if (window.parent) { ...
<rcyr>	beaky: What's the difference again?
<GreenJello>	beaky, it's like var x = y; but you can't assign to x after that
<beaky>	ah

<beaky>	oh well i can use immutablejs map
<dostoyevsky>	yeah... window.freeze is interesting
<ezakimak>	ace_me, you probably don't want to be modifying their url if you can help it

<GreenJello>	ah it has to be strict mode
<ezakimak>	no, it worked
<GreenJello>	yeah mdn says it doesn't throw unless it's strict mode
<ezakimak>	it's just that the result of the expression a.x = 2 is 2, the setter is called, but since it's frozen doesn't do anything, but for whatever reason resulted in 2
<ezakimak>	that is odd
<ezakimak>	should babelbot always be using strict mode?
<ezakimak>	since that's now the default in es6?
<GreenJello>	probably, but it makes sense why it isn't; it runs with node -p 'code', which could be considered a script, not a module
<ezakimak>	maybe it should be updated to inject 'strict mode' in front
<hrusti>	what is the best practice/difference between defining function as variable (var Foo = function(){}) vs. function Foo() {} when I want to use it for object/prototype ?
<ezakimak>	doesn't really matter.
<dostoyevsky>	hrusti: it's the same things
<kevireilly>	hrusti: worth noting that a regular function declaration is hoisted to the top, so `var foo = bar; function bar(){}` works but doesn’t when declared as a variable
<hrusti>	ok..
<kevireilly>	that pattern can be a little confusing though because you may see `bar` used but not see the declaration at the bottom
<hrusti>	I have another question about __proto__
<hrusti>	I will provide an example, just a sec.

<GreenJello>	ezakimak, done, thanks for the feedbacl
<ezakimak>	nice :)
<ezakimak>	yw
<ezakimak>	hrusti, fyi, __proto__ is non standard, and not supported everywhere
<ezakimak>	prefer Object.get/setPrototypeOf(), although the latter is not supported everywhere yet and must be polyfilled using __proto__ for IE
<hrusti>	ezakimak: I know
<hrusti>	http://jsfiddle.net/065sjwtg/1/
<hrusti>	how do I inherit prototype here
<gatti>	hey yall , haven't a bit of trouble initializing angular in jsfiddle wondering if anyone has a couple minutes to take a look?
<ezakimak>	one way: http://jsfiddle.net/m2yok1ff/
<ezakimak>	if each Bar needs it's own Foo
<GreenJello>	gatti, people usually use plunkr for angular
<ezakimak>	another way, same result http://jsfiddle.net/m2yok1ff/1/
<ezakimak>	oh, nm. not quite the same
<gatti>	GreenJello okay
<gatti>	works fine on a website just not showing up, i'll check out plunkr
<ezakimak>	that's what I meant: http://jsfiddle.net/m2yok1ff/2/
<ezakimak>	you can either change the prototype of this, or just ignore this and return a different object entirely
<emunah>	does the "arguments" object persist across invocations of a function?
*	meandi_2 is now known as meandi
<ezakimak>	arguments is distinct on every invocation
<emunah>	i would think that it is part of the call object and gets removed when the call object is removed
<emunah>	ezakimak: ok good
<ezakimak>	you can close over it
<emunah>	i need a javascript editor to test things out in
<ezakimak>	>> (function() { var outer = arguments; return function() { return arguments === outer; };)();
<ecmabot>	ezakimak: SyntaxError: syntax error
<ezakimak>	>> (function() { var outer = arguments; return function() { return arguments === outer; };})();
<ecmabot>	ezakimak: function () { return arguments === outer; }
<ezakimak>	>> (function() { var outer = arguments; return function() { return arguments === outer; };})()();
<ecmabot>	ezakimak: (boolean) false
<ezakimak>	emunah, just open your dev tools and use the console, or fire up node
<ashnur>	http://lg.io/2015/05/16/the-future-is-now-and-its-using-aws-lambda.html
<emunah>	i just tried my testcase and I don't understand why the arguments.id property persists across multiple invocations,
<gatti>	anyone mind taking a look why the angular code isn't showing properly? http://plnkr.co/edit/t4yakiiX2TAReN84z7L9?p=preview
<emunah>	uniqueID=function(){ if(!arguments.callee.id) arguments.callee.id=0; return arguments.callee.id++; };
<hrusti>	ezakimak: http://jsfiddle.net/m2yok1ff/4/
<hrusti>	why is barInstance object?
<emunah>	everytime I call uniqueID, the id value gets incremented, based on my understanding the call object should be removed from the scope chain, the call object contains a separate copy of the arguments property
<hrusti>	ezakimak: and fooInstance if instanceof Foo?
<ezakimak>	hrusti, what do you expect it to bee?
<hrusti>	ezakimak: Bar=
<hrusti>	Bar*
<ezakimak>	because Bar.prototype got replaced with a Foo
<ezakimak>	and the only 'constructor' property in the prototype chain is the one on Foo's prototype
<ezakimak>	"multiple inheritance" in JS is not what it is in other OOP paradigms
<ezakimak>	what exact behavior do you need?
<ezakimak>	you could set Object.getPrototypeOf(self).constructor = Bar in Bar()
<hrusti>	ezakimak: I want to understand how prototype works
<hrusti>	and constructors
<hrusti>	e.g. I want bar to inherit foo's prototype and constructor
<hrusti>	and to add some new properties to constructor and prototype
<hrusti>	but keep the foo prototype's functions and properties
<ezakimak>	new X() does: create a new, empty object x, assign x's internal [[prototype]] to the current value of X's .prototype property, call X() with 'this' pointing to x, if X() returns w/an object, use that object, else evaluate to x.
<ezakimak>	when you define X(), (or any function), by default it creates a new object { constructor: X } and assigns it to X.prototype;
<hrusti>	ezakimak: I think I understand what you are trying to say
<ezakimak>	both X.prototype, and X.prototype.constructor are regular objects and properties that you can edit
<ezakimak>	they are used as templates by the new and for lookup by instanceof
<ezakimak>	thus you can manipulate them to get whatever behavior you want
<ezakimak>	*nothing* is enforced or guaranteed
<ezakimak>	emunah, you aren't modifying arguments, you are modifying arguments.callee. is that the same each time?
<Sorella>	ezakimak: instanceof only looks at the prototype chain
<ezakimak>	i know
<emunah>	ezakimak: nope it increments, the callee is a reference to the function dataType itself, it looks like that code is adding an extra property to the function
<ezakimak>	right, it adds a property named 'id', and you keep referring to it each time
<ezakimak>	the same one, from the same caller
<gatti>	got it working
*	gatti updates no one
<emunah>	not the caller but the function itself
<emunah>	the language for discussing this stuff is very confusing
*	teear_ sucks anyones cock
<ezakimak>	arguments.callee is deprecated
<ezakimak>	what are you actually trying to do?
<hrusti>	ezakimak: and what is in __proto__ ?
<ezakimak>	__proto__ is the nonstandard way to access an object's internal [[prototype]]
<ezakimak>	same thing as Object.get/setPrototypeOf(obj)
<rcyr>	Soon to be standard :(
<doug16k__>	Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) is the good way
<ezakimak>	what? I thought they voted it out?
<rcyr>	I wish they would have just dropped __proto__... looks like an alien from Python
<rcyr>	ezakimak: Ah? really?
<ezakimak>	it's problematic at best
<hrusti>	so __proto__ === prototype???
<ezakimak>	no
<ezakimak>	__proto__ === internal [[prototype]]
<hrusti>	i dont understand what is internal prototype?
<ezakimak>	every object has an internal [[prototype]] that points to another object
<hrusti>	if I change "class" prototype it changes to all objects
<doug16k__>	rcyr, you can't drop things used by too many things
<hrusti>	so there is no internal prototype
<hrusti>	or am I wrong?
<rcyr>	doug16k__: You can at least _NOT_MAKE_THEM_STANDARD_ :(
<rcyr>	doug16k__: Leave __proto__ as a browser extension or something.
<ezakimak>	*function objects* (functions) also have a regular property named 'prototype' whos value is copied to newly created objects internal [[prototype]] by the new operator
<deltab>	an extension that everyone has to implement consistently?
<doug16k__>	yeah it is pretty clunky, but if you can make a better way and keep supporting the old broken way, that is the right thing to do
<rcyr>	deltab: I don't think anyone has to implement __proto__. AFAIK, it's not even widely used.
<ezakimak>	afaik FF doesn't implement __proto__
<doug16k__>	in a perfect world, yes, delete everything that sucks on the day we figure out that it sucks,then all the perfect companies can fix all their perfect software to always use the good way
<rcyr>	ezakimak: I thought they were the first to add it
<hrusti>	what is the difference between internal [[prototype]] and "Class" prototype
<hrusti>	?
<ezakimak>	there is no class in js.
<ezakimak>	unlearn that word
<hrusti>	thats why i use "
<hrusti>	:=)
<ezakimak>	there are only objects, and relations between objects
<ezakimak>	and the relations are malleable, at all times
<ezakimak>	only by convention (of your choosing) do you get the relations you want
<doug16k__>	the standard != real browsers, no matter how much pedants would like to believe the opposite.
<ezakimak>	queue xkcd episode on creating a new standard
<ezakimak>	https://xkcd.com/927/
<ezakimak>	and, btw, an object's internal [[prototype]] can point to null.
<hrusti>	how?
<ezakimak>	var obj = Object.create(null);
<hrusti>	aha ok
<ezakimak>	function NullObj() {}; NullObj.prototype = null; var obj = new NullObj();
<hrusti>	but it usually points to functions prototype, right?
<ezakimak>	to the ctor's .prototype at the time the ctor was called, yes.
<doug16k__>	the end of the prototype chain has a null prototype, by definition:
<doug16k__>	js> Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.getPrototypeOf({}))
<ecmabot>	doug16k__: (object) null
<hrusti>	ctor is constructor ?
<ezakimak>	yes
<ezakimak>	dtor is likewise destructor, but nst in js
<ezakimak>	or python.
<doug16k__>	the prototype is really a singly linked list "next" pointer pointing to the next prototype
<ezakimak>	yep.
<hrusti>	yes I got this
<hrusti>	it is because of inheritance, right?
<ezakimak>	and this is where enumarable and own come into play
<hrusti>	but I dont understand that ctor part :)
<ezakimak>	builtin for (p in obj) will traverse the obj *and* recur up its prototype chain
<ezakimak>	what part about the ctor?
<doug16k__>	the prototype is "the place to look if you dont find something here"
<doug16k__>	it repeats until found or it runs into a null prototype reference
<ezakimak>	which also allows you to shadow properties in the prototype chain
<hrusti>	ezakimak: what exactly is ctor of obj?
<ezakimak>	function Foo() { this.a = 1; } var f = new Foo();
<ezakimak>	Foo is the ctor for f
<doug16k__>	{}.toString() works because, it doesn't find toString, so it looks in its prototype, Object, which does have .toString
<ezakimak>	a ctor is any function you use with new
<hrusti>	I mean how to inherit prototype of Foo function and add some functions to my Bar prototype but not to Foo
<ezakimak>	you can't
<ezakimak>	you can't share two different prototypes
<doug16k__>	yes you can
<ezakimak>	well, you could, but you'd have to invert their order
<hrusti>	but how do I get that behaviour
<doug16k__>	ezakimak, I think you misunderstood
<doug16k__>	hrusti, you mean, how to I "inherit" Foo and add stuff to it ?
<hrusti>	yes
<ezakimak>	wait, no you can't do that hrusti
<doug16k__>	one sec I'll show you one way
<ezakimak>	no, he wants Bar to both *have* a Foo (eg, own copies of Foo's properties) and simultaneously *share* the Bar prototype (one copy)
<ezakimak>	the usual pattern to do that, is to compose them, eg in Bar() you make the selfsame new object also initialized by Foo
<ezakimak>	eg, function Bar(bar_arg, foo_arg) { Foo.call(this, foo_arg); this.b = bar_arg; }
<beaky>	are there alternatives to MVC for making a js app
<ezakimak>	yes, several
<beaky>	or is mvc the final word on app architecture
<beaky>	oh
<ezakimak>	MVC is just a pattern
<hrusti>	beaky: check mean stack
<doug16k__>	hrusti, http://jsfiddle.net/v4ee4fhb/
<beaky>	ive looked at mean but its chosen mongodb of all things as my datastore
<beaky>	plus angular is going to be obsolete in a few months
<doug16k__>	in that case I use the base prototype directly. sometimes you will instead "inherit" an instanceof the base created with new
<ddod>	Can anyone tell me an elegant way to remove a variable number of elements over x exist in an array? e.g. if array.length > 500, splice off everything after 500
<ezakimak>	use splice() ?
<beaky>	or slice
<ddod>	I mean specifically if there's a compact way of writing it
<ddod>	within that scenario
<doug16k__>	splice will modify in place, slice will build a new array
<ddod>	I'm having a brain fart as to how to do it without some temp variables and whatnot
<ezakimak>	just call arr.splice(0, 500);
<doug16k__>	splice can do things that may need a concat and 2 slices. use splice to remove rows
<hrusti>	doug16k__: thanks I see what you mean
<beaky>	b> const xs = Array(1000); console.log(xs.slice(0,500).length);
<babelbot>	beaky: 500 undefined
<ddod>	ah ok, i see
<hrusti>	doug16k__, ezakimak: but how is jQuery inherit all the javascript properties and added new one?
<ddod>	i was thinking of splice as in splice(500, n)
<hrusti>	the same way as doug16k__ did?
*	ircfox_ is now known as ircfox
<ezakimak>	arr.splice(0, Math.max(n, 500))
<hrusti>	or is fn jQuery's this.fn = {}
<ezakimak>	jquery *is* a function object

<doug16k__>	not even close to magical
<hrusti>	what about if I use this.myFunction = function() in constructor
<ezakimak>	then every time you create a new object w/that ctor, you create a new function and tack it on to that object
<deltab>	huck5: what do you see in the console?
<hrusti>	ezakimak: ok this is preformance leak
<ezakimak>	each object gets it's own version of that function
<doug16k__>	hrusti, then you will be adding a property to every instance, instead of sharing one property in the prototype
<ezakimak>	depends on what your purpose is
<hrusti>	but I get the behaviour I wanted
<ezakimak>	could be that function is a closure
<huck5>	deltab: Oooh... I see what's going on.
*	moloch is now known as zly
<huck5>	deltab: rendering partials via ajax. They obv all need a unique id
<hrusti>	so my bar object will inherit all foo object's properties and can add new one
<doug16k__>	hrusti, does it seem simple? if not, you're not getting something
<deltab>	doug16k__: ... its prototype set to $.fn
<hrusti>	doug16k__: it seems
<hrusti>	doug16k__: but I dont have clear picture
<ezakimak>	doug16k__, your example isn't what he's asking about
<hrusti>	doug16k__: if we start again...
<doug16k__>	prototype = place to look if prototype lookup fails. it is an instance of an object, it is not some vague imaginary thing like a C++ base class declaration
<doug16k__>	if property lookup fails*
<ezakimak>	hrusti, i suggest you draw it out with boxes and arrows on paper.
<hrusti>	doug16k__: if function() inherit Function.prototype and Function.prototype inherit Object.prototype if I change my Foo class which inherit Function.prototype it will change Object.prototype
<hrusti>	but it doesnt
<ezakimak>	huh?
<ezakimak>	again, unlearn the word "class"
<doug16k__>	hrusti, no, because "this" points to the outermost object
<doug16k__>	even when it looks in the prototype chain
<deltab>	hrusti: the *constructor function* inherits from the Function prototype
<deltab>	not the objects you construct using it
<doug16k__>	hrusti, it is "copy on write"
<ezakimak>	how does cow play in at all?
<doug16k__>	if you read .toString from {} then it will look through the prototype chain and find it in Object. 'this' still points to your object
<doug16k__>	then, if you assign to .toString, it assigns to your (outermost) object, hiding toString
<doug16k__>	hiding Object.toString*
<ezakimak>	think of the . (dot) operator as a search function, use left.right -> this = left, search left and left's prototype chain to find 'right' and invoke right with this set to left
<doug16k__>	so reads will read from the prototype, but if some code anywhere in the chain does this.something = x  then 'this' is still your object
<doug16k__>	so when you read "something" later, it wont look at the prototype chain, it is right there, property lookup succeeded
<ezakimak>	for assignment, the dot operator always works on the object itself, no prototype chain involved
<ezakimak>	well, that's not completely true
<ezakimak>	if the property isn't found anywhere first, then it gets added to the outermost object
<doug16k__>	true enough to improve understanding of how it is CoW though
<ezakimak>	i don't see CoW anywhere in this
<doug16k__>	really?
<deltab>	it's the implicit form of CoW where there isn't any actual copying
<ezakimak>	either it doesn't mean what you think it means, or it doesn't mean what I think it means.
<doug16k__>	js> var x = {};  print(x.toString());  x.toString = function() { print('override'); };  x.toString()
<ecmabot>	doug16k__: undefined; Console: '[object Object]', 'override'
<ezakimak>	that is not CoW
<doug16k__>	yes it is
<ezakimak>	no.
<doug16k__>	yes
<ezakimak>	That is assigning a new property to the x object which shadows the property on an object up x's prototype chain
<doug16k__>	it shared the shared one when reading... and if you write it, it becomes private. that is the DEFINITION of CoW
<ezakimak>	ok, in an abstract sense, yes
<ezakimak>	but it did not change the toString that was actually shared
<doug16k__>	exactly that's why it is copy on write. itdoesnt write the original, it makea its own copy and writes that
<doug16k__>	then future reads of it will use your private copy
<ezakimak>	kinda, sort of, yes
<doug16k__>	it's not perfect in js though. if there were an array in the prototype, and you did thing.theArray.push() it would modify the prototype's array
<ezakimak>	you aren't getting a private copy of the toString from the prototype though.
<doug16k__>	in that case you should explicity make a private property in the constructor
<nathaneltitane>	beaky: so far i have this: http://sprunge.us/AZFM
<nathaneltitane>	but the other page's header is preventing access
<ezakimak>	you're just inserting another symbol with the same name earlier in the lookup table
*	jasondockers is now known as cipher__
<ezakimak>	you're not getting a new copy of that prototype object
<doug16k__>	Copy on Write never really involved any copying anyway. the word probably ended up there because you end up with your own private "copy" (instance) of the original
<doug16k__>	any copying that may occur is for alignment because hardware paging MMU faults are used by the implementation
<ezakimak>	huh? yes, they do make a full copy, then perform the write
<emunah>	there is alot to learn with javascript
<ezakimak>	yes, it's not as simple as most people think it is upon first glance
<ezakimak>	but, then again, once you understand it, it's again simple.
<Sorella>	emunah: kinda. Not as much as C# or C++ tho
<ezakimak>	which is why imo it earns the right to be called elegant
<Sorella>	Or even Python and Ruby
<Sorella>	Lua is far more elegant tho, and simpler
<doug16k__>	and has a more powerful prototype mechanism imho
<ezakimak>	not counting loop language and macros, I'd say CL is
<doug16k__>	(lua)
<Sorella>	CL is anything but simple :D
<doug16k__>	I guess WoW wasn't a total waste of time lol
<ezakimak>	i meant elegant, not necessarily simple
<ezakimak>	although several concepts dovetail so nicely into each other it's simpler than it first appears
<Sorella>	Yeah, Lua is simpler than JS, and also more powerful :3
<Sorella>	CL is... I'm not sure I'd call it elegant either
<Sorella>	It's powerful, tho
<ezakimak>	neat things like keyword args actually just being symbols in the axiomatic unnamed package
<doug16k__>	has anyone here broken bones in both hands? just curious how many other devs have severely injured their hands lol
<ezakimak>	never broken a hand bone yet
<ezakimak>	foot, yes
<ezakimak>	box much?
<doug16k__>	lol
<ezakimak>	mostly my brain feels broken a lot
<gatti>	you could be tired and/or dehydrated
<ezakimak>	did you actually hurt your hands from typing?
<Sorella>	I've never broken a bone yet
<bprompt>	hmm
<ezakimak>	the combination of my kinesis keyboard and dvorak i haven't had hand/wrist strain in decades
<bprompt>	broken hand bones?    what the?
*	bprompt is available with a hammer if anyone need their hand bones tenderized a bit
<ezakimak>	a good ball peen works wonders
<doug16k__>	lol
<doug16k__>	my brother's great dane nearly twisted my 2 middle fingers off my left hand, spiral fractured both fingers, one was at a 45 degree angle on the axis along the bone. dog saw a squirrel
<hrusti>	ezakimak, doug16k__: why if I create a var foo = function(){} console.log(foo) I dont see proto??
<ezakimak>	what do you see?
<doug16k__>	hrusti, depends on browser. in chrome you won't. in IE you would
<Hannibal_Smith>	doug16k__, do as Stallman after he was bannished from using a keyboard because RSI...ductate your code to some assistant!
<ezakimak>	it's going to call toString on it
<Hannibal_Smith>	*dictate
<deltab>	duck tape
<ezakimak>	that poor assistant
<ezakimak>	does he use spaces or tabs???
<doug16k__>	with a beard like that? hmmm. probably tabs.
<doug16k__>	saves memory
<Hannibal_Smith>	I'm always impressed with the story of RMS
<Hannibal_Smith>	I question myself today who are people like him
<doug16k__>	but he probably preprocesses his code to conceal his indentation preferences from prying eyes
<doug16k__>	I love richard stallman :D
<ezakimak>	oh, but he invented emacs, so he just lets emacs do it all for him
<Hannibal_Smith>	ezakimak, well in the end he made the concept of open source something that people can idenfify and defens
<Hannibal_Smith>	And today we have IBM, MS relasing and contributing to open source
<ezakimak>	it was certainly a long, hard road, but in the end the world has gotten at least part way to where he envisioned
<Hannibal_Smith>	I can't even think today programming without open source
<ezakimak>	standing on the backs of giants
<Hannibal_Smith>	Yes
<doug16k__>	most good programmers do it because they enjoy programming. don't tell HR though
<bprompt>	well.. to be fair, you can't quite stand on the back... well.. you can cling on it... because is vertically-inclined
<ezakimak>	i haven't had to pay for any software in over 20 years

<bprompt>	broman:     stick the method in the lexical scope of the first one "success" handler, so when the 1st one comes through, the next one will kick in
<broman>	bprompt, actually i explained it wrong.. i have a method fillTable() that is called on the success of the first ajax request... inside this method i want to catch a few more informations from another page... how can i make this function wait for the response?
<bprompt>	broman:     well.. fillTable() is called upon success of the 1st one, so if the "other" process is inside this method, then the 1st call success is a fait accompli
<bprompt>	broman:     by the time fillTable()  runs whatever within its lexical scope, the 1st success would be a done deal, so is ok to process
<broman>	bprompt, the second method is inside fillTable()!
<broman>	in fillTable i parse the json and call a function that makes an ajax request and get some more info
<bprompt>	broman:    well, if fillTable() is parsing the json obtained... that means the 1st call success is done already, so whatever needs to "wait" for the 1st one, needs no waiting at that scope
<broman>	bprompt, there are 3 phases: first one calls one ajax... when its completed, it calls the method fillTable().. inside fillTable() i make another ajax request to grab some info
<broman>	i need to change the scope then, right?
<bprompt>	broman:    nope, if you want "another request" to wait till the 1st one is done, then fillTable() is the scope you'd want, since fillTable() is called when the 1st one is done
<broman>	bprompt, thank you! :)
<Felishia>	HALP!
<Felishia>	how do I recursive copy an element?
<Felishia>	actually
<bprompt>	np
<Felishia>	I only care that the elements got new id's
<Felishia>	no wai
<Felishia>	they shouldn't be the same
<Felishia>	well well I need to make a deep copy of objects
<Felishia>	but so that they don't get the same id's
<Felishia>	I need to avoid cycles as well :(
<Maxdamantus>	Felishia: you should only be concerned with ids of a finite number elements described by the HTML.
<Felishia>	Maxdamantus, actually is not HTML
<Felishia>	it's a bunch of objects
<Maxdamantus>	Felishia: ids are effectively a form of global variables.
<Maxdamantus>	so do you mean keys?
<Felishia>	it's basically a bunch of objects created via the OOP approach of javascript (if it can even be called like that)
<deltab>	not DOM objects?
<Felishia>	I need to create duplicates of that object
<Felishia>	nope
<Sorella>	Felishia: the simplest way would be if each object decided how it's supposed to be copied
<Maxdamantus>	you can do a copy including cycles using some sort of object map (like Map or WeakMap)
<Felishia>	Sorella, that's true
<Felishia>	but everything else can be the same
<Felishia>	except the id
<Felishia>	problem is that I have an element
<Sorella>	Other than that, you need to recursively go down every type of object and create a new object that is similar. It's impossible to actually do proper deep copies in JS because of things like closures though
<Sorella>	And it's not clear what "deep copy" would mean for host objects either
<deltab>	if you have closures within your objects
<Felishia>	that I say eg. Element.parent.children and so it's a cycle... because it's a tree
<Sorella>	Felishia: you need to keep a map of elements you've already visited and their clones
<bprompt>	`deep copy
<Sorella>	And if you're not going to run that just on ES6 engines, you might want to be clever with objects and hashes, instead of using an association array
<Maxdamantus>	function clone(obj){ var m = new WeakMap(); function c(o){ if(typeof o != "object") return o; if(!m.has(o)){ var o_ = {}; m.set(o, o_); Object.keys(o).forEach(function(k){ o_[k] = c(o[k]); }); } return m.get(o); } return c(obj); }
<Maxdamantus>	(untested)
<Sorella>	might want to use `Object.create(Object.getPrototypeOf(o))` instead of {} there. And account for arrays/magic objects
<Maxdamantus>	b> function clone(obj){ var m = new WeakMap(); function c(o){ if(typeof o != "object") return o; if(!m.has(o)){ var o_ = {}; m.set(o, o_); Object.keys(o).forEach(function(k){ o_[k] = c(o[k]); }); } return m.get(o); } return c(obj); } var foo = { bar: {} }; foo.foo = foo; foo.bar.bar = bar; clone(foo);

<reduce>	hrm
<reduce>	good point
<reduce>	in my scenario im expecting the element to be removed from its parent, but this solution would be then be brittle to future changes
<wolfram74>	I feel like I'm missing something incredibly stupid, but why isn't exec moving onto the next instance? http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=uC10KE1RmS
<wolfram74>	http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=uC10KE1RmS
<wolfram74>	I am missing something obvious about exec
<falafel>	wolfram74, what exactly are you trying to do?
<falafel>	wolfram74, you don't need exec most of the time
<wolfram74>	i'm trying to get the indices of captures, so in this case it should match 9 times with a different index and then get null
<falafel>	>>'00000'.replace(/0/g, function(_, i){console.log(i)}) @ wolfram74
<ecmabot>	wolfram74: (string) 'undefinedundefinedundefinedundefinedundefined'; Console: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
<wolfram74>	But I don't want to do a global replace, I want to produce a new string for each local replace
<falafel>	wolfram74, what do you expect as output?
<falafel>	wolfram74, btw, replace is not just for replacing, I just used it to iterate through the matches, the resulting string is discarded
<falafel>	`exec` is that it mutates the regex, this isn't ideal
<Agamemnus>	So I had a question
<Agamemnus>	But I forgot
*	foooey is now known as fooey
<Nurbs>	I am currently using the idiom "export default class Foo { ... foo() { Foo._foo(); } ... static _bar() { ... } };" Is there any way not to name "Foo" (export default class { ... }), but still refer to the current class in ES6 (or possibly 7)?
<falafel>	Nurbs, `this`?
<falafel>	Nurbs, it all depends on how you call `foo`
*	voltagex1 is now known as voltagex
<Sorella>	Nurbs: JS doesn't have classes, and no, you can't refer to an arbitrary constructor function without naming said constructor function, or binding it to some variable
<falafel>	Sorella, I think he means inside a method, in `Foo._foo()` you could do `this.constructor._foo()` assuming you call `Foo#foo` like `instance.foo()`
<Sorella>	JS doesn't have even bound methods, which makes things more interesting :D (IOW, you should probably not try writing the OO styles you're familiar with in JS)
*	zz_robotmayo is now known as robotmayo
<Sorella>	falafel: .constructor won't necessarily be there, even if you're passing the correct instance though :)
<falafel>	Sorella, if he is using "class" it should
<Sorella>	b> class Foo(){ foo(){ return this.constructor.name } }; var f = new Foo(); f.constructor = function OhNoes(){ }; f.foo()
<babelbot>	Sorella: SyntaxError: [eval]: Unexpected token (1:24) > 1 | 'use strict';  class Foo(){ foo(){ return this.constructor.name } }; var f = new Foo(); f.constructor = function OhNoes(){ }; f.foo()     |                         ^     at raise (/usr/lib/node_modules/babel/node_modules/acorn-babel/acorn_csp.js:343:15)     at unexpected (/usr/lib/node_modules/babel/node_modules/acorn-b…
<Sorella>	Doesn't Babel support classes?
<falafel>	Sorella, ok, but that's not real world, if he is using class he wouldn't be overriding the constructor
<falafel>	Sorella, class Foo {}
<Sorella>	falafel: sure, you can be optimistic about it. I'm saying there are no guarantees that it's going to point to what you want
<Sorella>	Oh, right, not Scala =/
<Sorella>	b> class Foo { foo(){ return this.constructor.name } }; var f = new Foo(); f.constructor = function OhNoes(){ }; f.foo()
<babelbot>	Sorella: OhNoes
<Sorella>	If they had made it `class Foo(args){ ... }` it'd be much more useful though.
<falafel>	but in that sense you can't be optimistic about anything publicly exposed that can be monkey patched
<Sorella>	falafel: that's also true.
<Sorella>	falafel: is `(class Foo {}).prototype` frozen btw?
<Chris____>	Hello, I was hoping someone could help me with an issue I am having. I am fairly familiar with PHP/HTML but am new to JS. I am trying to create a few buttons to perform php functions. I was wondering if its possible to only allow the javascript button to be pressed if the user is authenticated to press it
<Nurbs>	I was thinking there might be some keyword to refer to the "class" like some languages offer, but mainly because eslint started complaining that the class "is already declared in the upper scope"; I'll turn that warning off instead then.
<falafel>	Sorella, no
<Sorella>	Hmm
<falafel>	Sorella, at least not according to Babel
<falafel>	I think the spec doesn't say anything about that
<falafel>	By all means "class" is just prototypes, it doesn't change the bahavior
<Sorella>	Nurbs: no, mostly because JS doesn't have "classes" in the sense those other languages you're familiar with have. It has only objects and constructors. And "class" is just a declarative syntax for a constructor function
<falafel>	so it shouldn't change the expectations
<Sorella>	Objects are still inheriting directly from other objects, with no classification whatsoever, and each one with its own set of methods, regardless of which constructor function has generated it. You can even change which object some object inherits from dynamically
<Sorella>	b> class Foo { toString(){ return 'boo' }}; var bar = { toString() { return 'oops' }}; var qux = new Foo(); qux.__proto__ = bar; qux.toString()

<oojacoboo>	is there a way to tell console.log to use the previous caller for showing the caller output in the console?

<khmer>	oojacoboo: you can capture the stack trace using Error.captureStackTrace
<oojacoboo>	falafel: mmm not familiar :/
<oojacoboo>	khmer: this isn't for error handling
<falafel>	oojacoboo, it is non-standard, but all browsers support it afaik

<oojacoboo>	falafel: I see - just debug logging

<scrandaddy>	Is there a way to have methods on prototype.foo get called as if they were on prototype?
<scrandaddy>	With the same this scope?
<rcyr>	scrandaddy: Not sure I understand.
<scrandaddy>	rcyr: I would love to have MyConstructor.prototype.foo.bar so that I can do myObj.foo.bar()
<xa0z>	What's the best way to make a website continue to load, even when it's waiting on some javascript from remote sources, such as Google AdSense, or waiting for DNS, etc, etc?
<scrandaddy>	But in this case, this would have the value of foo, I need it to be myObj
<falafel>	scrandaddy, I would recommend not doing that, nesting objects in prototypes is not good practice
<falafel>	scrandaddy, why do you think you need that?
<scrandaddy>	I have a bunch of animations for my object. I want to store them all under "fx"
<falafel>	scrandaddy, prefix them
<scrandaddy>	myObj.fx.shrink() for example
<falafel>	myObj.fxShrink()
<scrandaddy>	Fair enough
<scrandaddy>	The other way I was playing with is attaching them all to MyConstructor.fx, then I have a method called effect on the prototype that call()s them in the context of the object. Is that overdoing it?
<falafel>	scrandaddy, I'd say that's ok too
*	Guest68729 is now known as Torkable
<scrandaddy>	Great, thanks for the advice
<scrandaddy>	And for making like every node package I ever use possible. Assuming you're the same falafel :)

<falafel>	maybe not...
<falafel>	oh, this is because the `eval` only works in ES5 code, duh
<falafel>	maybe it'll work in a browser that actually supports template strings
<SET001>	yes it work
<SET001>	I just trying to find another way, without `eval`
<falafel>	SET001, why do you need to do this?
<SET001>	long story *(
<falafel>	SET001, how about `format({a:1,b:2}, '${a}${b}')`
<falafel>	you parse it, then pass in the variables you need explicitly
<falafel>	if you have expressions, then `eval` is probably the only way about it
<SET001>	falafel, i'm writing a shader for webGL application that is in separate file, but I also have to split it with some default shaders that exists in framework and i cant just split them like strings, i have to inserts one shader insite another
<SET001>	so i want something like this https://gist.github.com/SET001/a47abb57598b738c0a22
<SET001>	in my shader
<falafel>	SET001, why can't the shader be a JS file, that takes in some dependencies, and exports a string?
<falafel>	SET001, something like that http://dpaste.com/09D98CW
<SET001>	shader written on GLSL language, not on JS
<falafel>	SET001, not sure what you want tbh... why is it a string then?
<SET001>	hmmm...
<SET001>	module.exports is an nodejs feature, isn't it?
<falafel>	SET001, yes, you can use Browserify though
<falafel>	SET001, but it owuld be the same idea using a <script> file, if THREE is in scope, then it'll work
<SET001>	ok, thanx, I'll try
<doug16k>	SET001, I've seen people use type="x-glsl-shader" or something on the script tags. I tried it and it seemed to work fine
<doug16k>	<script data-shadertype="vertex" type="x-glsl-shader"...>  ->  querySelectorAll('script[type=x-glsl-shader]')... getAttribute('data-shadertype') ... etc
<doug16k>	if you can stand the allcaps names, you could put VERTEX_SHADER in the type attrib then directly index your context: gl[shaerTypeAttr]
<doug16k>	var shader = gl.createShader(gl[getAttribute('data-shadertype')])
<BenL90>	Helllo, anyone know how to change every class properties with name "somthing", every of it and not using libary, normal js, pure js?
<deltab>	BenL90: not sure what you mean by 'change every class properties with name "somthing"'
<doug16k>	BenL90, document.querySelectorAll('[someAttribName]')
<deltab>	I guess you want to select every element of a certain class, but then what?
<doug16k>	find every element with some attribute?
<doug16k>	I'm assuming you must mean selecting some elements. otherwise I have no idea what you said

<huck5>	How can I call a Button/Anchor's onClick method, from another function?
<logy>	hello everyone, i am new with js. Is there a command that  when you press a button it will type some words  ( a string) where the cursor is set to.
<Havvy>	logy:  You can write a function to do it, but it's not a built-in.
<logy>	Havvy i am sorry i am new, i just want the pc to type a word where the cursor is pointed (where i clicked in the doc). But i dont know how adress the place where the cursor is
<Havvy>	Ah, figuring out which element the mouse is over might be a little tricky.
<Havvy>	I'm too tired to think of which methods are most useful to do this.
<deltab>	you could look at one of the html editor libraries
<BenL90>	deltab: I want to change the properties, the width
<BenL90>	I don't like use jQuery, because to heavy, simple js
<dtscode>	Good morning #javascript!
<gkatsev>	BenL90: [].forEach.call(document.querySelectorAll('.something'), function(el) { el.style.width = 50px;
<gkatsev>	BenL90: [].forEach.call(document.querySelectorAll('.something'), function(el) { el.style.width = '50px'; });
<BenL90>	gkatsev: Why there's a symbol not detected on my computer chat
<gkatsev>	?
<BenL90>	gkatsev: Is smsjjs.forEach.call(document.querySelectorAll('.something'), function(el) { el.style.width = '50px'; });
<gkatsev>	should be []
<BenL90>	gkatsev: font not redable on my comp, is that jquery? i just want pure js
<gkatsev>	i.e., an array
<falafel>	!snip qsa @ BenL90
<ecmabot>	BenL90: This snippet mimics jQuery syntax while being much lighter: function qsa(sel, parent){ return Array.prototype.slice.call((parent || document).querySelectorAll(sel)); }
<gkatsev>	BenL90: it's just javascript. I'm not sure why regular ascii brackets aren't showing up for you
<BenL90>	gkatsev: Oh just simple bracket
<dtscode>	I think he was confusing it with the square that shows up when it doesn't recognize a character
<gkatsev>	heh
<gkatsev>	get a better font, then :P
<dtscode>	Yep :D
<gkatsev>	BenL90: also, see the "qsa" snippet that falafel pointed you at via ecmabot
<BenL90>	gkatsev: so if i have a class something so that code will change every css properties for all class name "smoething"
<gkatsev>	BenL90: my snippet will go through all elements with the class something and change their width to 50px
<dtscode>	Was shown a funny picture today: http://i.imgur.com/agLs7kw.jpg
<gkatsev>	dtscode: someone should compare those books to the java black book
<Havvy>	dtscode:  Har har, but remember, 2/3 of the second book is DOM and The Good Parts sort of expects you to know about JS already.
<dtscode>	gkatsev: :D
<gkatsev>	and what Havvy said
<dtscode>	Havvy: I wouldn't know. I haven't read either.
<dtscode>	I was sure there was a good explanation. It was just a funny comparison.
<Sorella>	gkatsev: any comparison to Java is unfair because the book needs to spend at least 3 pages to present a simple Hello, world example :P
<gkatsev>	Sorella: lol, also, the java black book is basically just api listings with some small samples for each. It's massive.
<gkatsev>	it's big enough to kill with, probably.
<Sorella>	Why... would anyone buy a book like that? O.o
<Havvy>	Because the Internet was a novelty when Java came out?
<gkatsev>	it's a reference for the language
<gkatsev>	yep, searching for the api on the internet wasn't an easy thing

<gkatsev>	maybe in a million years
<Sorella>	webdex: nope, JS won't have a big API surface
<webdex>	every time i check the W3C website there's another interface on its way - especially for html device app development

<dman777_alter>	http://dpaste.com/29V572X I don't understand...I am using reference memory...but when I assign a new value to kickSearch.box, $scope.searchBox does not show the new value
<deltab>	why do you set scope.searchBox to the old value of kickSearch.box?
<dman777_alter>	deltab: because I have 2 controllers that talk with each other... am I passing by value or by reference in that?
<deltab>	no, doesn't look like it
<deltab>	the only calls there are $location.search() and terms.join(" ")
<deltab>	JS is soley by-value though
<dman777_alter>	deltab: oh...does $scope.searchBox = kickSearch.box need to be something like $scope.searchBox = kickSearch.obj.box?
<deltab>	I don't know what any of those things are
<dman777_alter>	kickSearch is a service but really a singleton
<deltab>	however I can tell that  $scope.searchBox = kickSearch.box; terms = ...; kickSearch.box = if _.isArray terms then terms.join(" ") else terms  won't set $scope.searchBox to the new value of terms
<dman777_alter>	deltab: how can you tell?
<deltab>	because = does assignment, not aliasing
<dman777_alter>	deltab: but wouldn't the aliasing be $scope.searchBox = kickSearch.box?

<falafel>	^^
<tomvolek>	I tried to use it, it didnt work .. ok i will have another look
<deltab>	hmm, could the assignment/aliasing distinction help clear up CBV/CBR terminology?
<xaxxon>	tomvolek, I promise settimeout works :)
<tomvolek>	i am sure I am doing something wrong :)
<xaxxon>	setTimeout(function(){...}, 1000);
<tomvolek>	yes I know that part :)
<xaxxon>	well then put something very simple in the functino call
<deltab>	"didn't work"?
<xaxxon>	setTimeout(function(){console.log("HI");}, 1000);
<xaxxon>	if you're using a function you've already written, make sure you're not putting parenthesis on it
<xaxxon>	setTimeout(myFunction(), 1000); is wrong (unless you've very carefully written myFunction, but that's probably not hte case here)
<xaxxon>	you'd want setTimeout(myFunction, 1000);

*	Alcubier1e is now known as Alcubierre
<tomvolek>	thanks , guys,  setTimeout works.  my code problem seem to be me :)   I have over 100 small circles, which I try to change the color on them one at a time inside a canvas. for somereason .. the color on all of them change at the same time :)
<falafel>	tomvolek, try reproducing in jsfiddle
<tomvolek>	myTimeout = setTimeout(changeColor, 1000);   does get calles after 1 second
<xaxxon>	yay
<tomvolek>	but I see my entire array of circles change color at once, which the color changing is done in the setTimoeut callback fucntion
<falafel>	is that inside a loop?
<xaxxon>	heh
<falafel>	post a demo, otherwise it is very hard for us to tell whats wrong
<tomvolek>	falafel:   yes,  Let me past it into a pastie
<falafel>	!last @ tomvolek
<ecmabot>	tomvolek: If something is only being applied to the 'last' one of many, you might have a scoping problem. e.g.: in for (i=0; i<5; ++i) {doX(function(){ doY(i); });} `doY' might only receive 5 as a value. You can solve this using closures, so see !closures. For more info see http://www.mennovanslooten.nl/blog/post/62/
<xaxxon>	tomvolek, you need to call setTimeout frmo within changeColor
<falafel>	tomvolek, post it in a fiddle, so we can reproduce the exact issue
<xaxxon>	tomvolek, call setTimeout once from "normal" place then at the end of changeColor call it again
<tomvolek>	ok guys, give me a sec , let me paste it

<tomvolek>	oh nice
<deltab>	okay, so what's meant to happen?
<tomvolek>	anyhow as you can see  first I draw all the circles ..
<tomvolek>	then I try to fill the circles with a red color , then I want to wait some miliseconds or one second and change the color of one circle back to white and move to the next circle
<tomvolek>	this way I could show a red dot moving around
<tomvolek>	teh last for loop, is where I was trying to chance the color of one circle
<deltab>	ah okay
<deltab>	yeah, you can't do that in a loop
<falafel>	tomvolek, the loop spawns pointArray.length timeouts in parallel
<tomvolek>	I loop through all teh circles ...  inside the loop I set the fillStyle ="red "  fillCircle and tehn want to wait and fill it back up with white and loop will end and I move to the next circle
<tomvolek>	sorry , What i cant do in a loop ?
<falafel>	tomvolek, if the loop finishes in 1ms, that means pointArray.length timeouts will complete in 1000 to 1001 ms
<deltab>	nothing will happen on screen until your code returns
<falafel>	so all points turn red
<tomvolek>	true
<tomvolek>	that is teh behavior I see
<tomvolek>	I need to save value of pointArray.length in a variable and use it
<falafel>	tomvolek, recurse with setTimeout, wait for the previous one to finish
<deltab>	you may be expecting that each iteration of the loop takes one second, but that doesn't work in JS
<falafel>	tomvolek, you can iterate an array asynchronously with setTimeout for example
<tomvolek>	can you point me to any example I can look at ?

<TKoL>	this morning I figured out a solid answer
<TKoL>	in Chrome Console, in the Scripts section, there's a tab called 'snippets'
<TKoL>	you can easily create a new 'snippet', set breakpoints on it, and run it on the current page as if it were part of that page

<Mia>	I want to use setinterval to emit an array every second. I want to send the array only when the array is not empty. Here is my code: http://hastebin.com/xejugadori.avrasm
<Mia>	for some reason eventhough lineArray.length logs 0, it keeps sending it
<clarkk>	Can anyone hazard a guess why many of the lines of the bootstrap js library are not terminated with a semicolon?  For example   https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/dist/js/bootstrap.js#L8
<Mia>	Okay here is a question -
<Mia>	how can I console log everything in an array every 1000/array.length miliseconds?
<kyshtynbai>	Hmmm. Can I pass the id of an element as an argument of a function, like: function test(arg) { var id = document.getElementById(arg); } ?

<quarters>	hello

<tarkus>	Q (commonjs): If I have several .js files with helper functions inside ./utils folder, how can I require them with `import foo from './utils'`, should I create ./utils/index.js and list all the exported functions, or is there a better way doing it?
<tarkus>	* import { froo } from './utils';

<quarters>	in what scenarios do websites typically return requests with json responses?
<zap0>	Mia, consoles might have flooding protection.
<zap0>	quarters, all situations.
<Nazral>	say, I have a * { ... } in a css and I want to remove it in javascript
<Nazral>	how do I do that ?
<quarters>	zap0: how would I be able to view json as opposed to html?
<zap0>	quarters, browsers often view JSON just fine.
<quarters>	for example, how would I see the json request when requesting www.google.com on a browser
<zap0>	ask teh owners of that web site how to instruct it to return JSON.
<quarters>	So does that mean that websites don't unconditionally return json but at the webmaster's discretion?
<quarters>	I'm sorry for the n00b questions. I'm having some difficulty understanding what json is outside of an object
<RLa>	quarters, json is string representation of an object
<RLa>	you cannot send raw objects over http
<quarters>	how do I publish json?
<quarters>	I'm testing it through a rails app
<quarters>	I'm not sure if my question is more specific to rails
<quarters>	or if knowing more about json will help me understand how to use it

<potaz>	is there a json database anywhere? not mongodb...
<gatti>	good morning
<jewetnit>	potaz: couchdb?
<jewetnit>	gatti: morning
<gatti>	i've set alerts and confirmed that this the numbers going in to this if should make it work, but it wont go in.. ny ideas?
<gatti>	if (vm.segments[i-2].angleHoriz < vm.segments[i].angleHoriz)
<gatti>	do I need to convert from string to #?
<jewetnit>	gatti: what are you trying to achieve
<potaz>	jewetnit: alas, erlang crashes on my freebsd box
<gatti>	I am trying to go in to the If statement
<gatti>	but it's not even registering, and i confirmed they are both #s and the first is indeed less than the second
<jewetnit>	gatti: I understand, but what is vm, what is vm.segments and what is vm.segments[n].angleHoriz
<jewetnit>	I guess I would typecast to int
<jewetnit>	If the only thing wrong is the number being a string
<gatti>	I tried parseInt() but that didn't work either
<gatti>	and parseFloat()
<jewetnit>	do you have a fiddle?
<gatti>	http://plnkr.co/edit/t4yakiiX2TAReN84z7L9?p=preview
<gatti>	you can see the test from lines 146->149
<gatti>	in script,js
<gatti>	oh crap, had vm.segment.designRad instead of vm.segments
<jewetnit>	is 143 though 146 correct? indentation is weird
<gatti>	could be the issue
<gatti>	if you see line 149
<gatti>	yes it all works
<gatti>	sorry it's messy, yea the alerts should be indented
<jewetnit>	nice :)
<gatti>	i added all those to try and fix
<jewetnit>	alright
<jewetnit>	it works now? replacing vm.segment.designRad?
<gatti>	yes:)
<jewetnit>	:D
<gatti>	changing it to vm.segments
<gatti>	silly s
<gatti>	lol
<jewetnit>	99% of the time its stuff like this
<gatti>	i guess the program stopped there because vm.segment didnt exist
<gatti>	err, segment does but not that
<gatti>	friend of mine set this all up for me so i am hacking away at it
<gatti>	first time messing around in javascript, really
<gatti>	thanks for taking a look, though, i appreciate it
<jewetnit>	no problem :)
<jewetnit>	do you like it? (javascript)
<jewetnit>	what languages are you used to/
<jewetnit>	?
<gatti>	yes it's pretty fun
<gatti>	none too much, really
<gatti>	have some experience in high school but i went the engineering route
<jewetnit>	ah right
<gatti>	so i know all the guts that should go in this program just not how to represent it on a website
<jewetnit>	I think javascript is a lot of fun as well, very expressive
<jewetnit>	right
<gatti>	im worried it wont be able to handle some of my calculations
<gatti>	we will see..
<jewetnit>	hahahaha
<jewetnit>	In what sense?
<jewetnit>	performance?
<gatti>	I'm just not sure it is set up to do iterative math problems
<gatti>	I am used to excel
<jewetnit>	can you give me an example?
<gatti>	One step of the calculation is assuming an average force value and then iterating to determine the geometry
<gatti>	and once that geometry has been iterated, then actually assigning the force back
<gatti>	it's something that tripped up VBA a bit so i hope it wont be an issue with javascript
<jewetnit>	what happened?
<gatti>	system overload
<jewetnit>	ah right
<jewetnit>	a lot of data?
<gatti>	not sure what the issue with it was
<gatti>	i gave up on trying to perfect it in excel/vba because of it
<gatti>	figure try and throw it on a website
<doug16k>	gatti, javascript uses the fpu just like any language
<doug16k>	any accuracy or roundoff issues would happen anyway
<doug16k>	gatti, adding one value to another may have absolutely no effect. if you loop until some condition, it may never become true because some normalization is rounding off all of the precision causing that operation to have no effect
<doug16k>	js> print(0 + Math.pow(2,-52), 2 + Math.pow(2,-52))
<ecmabot>	doug16k: undefined; Console: 2.220446049250313e-16, 2
<doug16k>	what happens is, the lower one is shifted right to align it with the bigger one. it has to shift it way off the end causing the + to be + 0
<doug16k>	52 isn't arbitrary. there are 52 mantissa bits in js's double precision IEEE 754 numbers
<Sorella>	If you want accuracy, you can always use a BigDecimal/BigInt library. They're slow tho
<basiclaser>	Hey. What are the best ways to self-study computer science ? I'd be open to an online interactive course, book or video series. Thanks. I've already been messing with web tech for a couple years, just want to have a more solid foundation

<syncdumb>	However, it it not working as intended. Anyone who can point me in the right direction
<deltab>	quetzakubica: no, but they are similar
<GreenJello___>	!async @ syncdumb
<ecmabot>	syncdumb: JavaScript doesn't have a concept of "sleep" or "wait". This functionality may be provided by the environment, such as browser JS's setTimeout. E.g., http://jsfiddle.net/8Y5qe/. jQuery and many other libraries support promises, e.g. http://jsfiddle.net/4n9Gu/.  Also take a look at https://github.com/caolan/async https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird https://github.com/kriskowal/q when you have a lot of callbacks.
<GreenJello___>	syncdumb, the problem is likely that you expect the loop to wait for these network requests to finish before continuing, which it doesn't
<syncdumb>	 GreenJello__ exactly but i cannot figure out how to get it working mate
<deltab>	quetzakubica: a function could have the effect of deleting something, which would be idempotent but not RT, because you couldn't replace it with "okay, deleted" with the same effect
<deltab>	for instance
<quetzakubica>	deltab: so side effects are not referential transparent?
<syncdumb>	GreenJello__ i should probably create a remove function and call that when the requests are finished, yes ?
<quetzakubica>	but are idempotent?
<deltab>	quetzakubica: they may or may not be
<quetzakubica>	deltab: ah, I get
<vileRaisin>	syncdumb, you run a query, but you don't wait for its response
<vileRaisin>	pretty sure that's not going to play well
<syncdumb>	vileRaisin it didnt
<quetzakubica>	so f (x, y) { return 1; } is RT because I can replace it with just 1
<quetzakubica>	but f (x, y) { deleteSomethingFromDB(); return 1; } is not
<Sorella>	quetzakubica: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/210835/what-is-referential-transparency/9859966#9859966
<deltab>	quetzakubica: I'm not actually sure about the second half
<vileRaisin>	haha, I was just trying to rephrase what GreenJello___ says
<vileRaisin>	you don't necessarily need to use promises and things like that, but you can't put a while loop after an async method expecting it to have responded
<quetzakubica>	deltab: then what would not be RT for sure?
<vileRaisin>	I don't know what database library you're using, but the least you could do is set an interval after the query execution to see if it has responded
<quetzakubica>	Sorella: that answer is to abstract for me
<quetzakubica>	Sorella: I get abstract things once I get some concrete examples, unfortunately
*	otrenav_ is now known as otrenav
<Sorella>	quetzakubica: what people in CS mean when they say "referential transparency" is that if you've got `f(x) = x * 2; f(2)`, that's always going to be the same as `4`. Idempotency just means that if you execute something more than once, the subsequent times won't have any new effect. So e.g.: `lights.turnOn(); lights.turnOn()` is idempotent, because the second
<Sorella>	time doesn't cause any new effect.
<Sorella>	The SO answer is mostly discussing the origin of the term "referential transparency" and some other philosophical thingies.
*	lizzin is now known as Guest52050
<quetzakubica>	Sorella: ok, so that lights.turnOn() is idempotent, but isn't RT?

<ELLIOTTCABLE>	Sorella: whaaaaaat? There's a truly pure variant of Haskell that can get things to "something external"? how?
<Sorella>	cipher__: right, so you mean the environment record / activation. It lives for as long as there's something pointing to it (the anonymous function points to it as the parent environment record). Since the anonymous function is still held in the event queue, no GC is performed on it, consequently no GC is performed on its parent's activation record, so
<Sorella>	'greet' gets to stay in the heap
<quetzakubica>	Sorella: that gist shows a pure programming approach for IO?
<quetzakubica>	pure functional programming*
<cipher__>	Sorella, oh, why does the GC know in general not to reclaim memory in closures? Just reference counting?

*	zz_robotmayo is now known as robotmayo
<Sorella>	cipher__: not exactly. The event loop is a loop, which happens to check a queue of events referred to as event queue.
<cipher__>	okay
<Sorella>	cipher__: it's basically `while (true){ var event = eventQueue.shift(); if (event) event(); else break }`
<cipher__>	mh, okay
*	Dorf_ is now known as Dorf
*	tinylobsta1 is now known as tinylobsta
<reduce>	i need to create some xml in javascript
<reduce>	any recommendations on how to approach this?
<zomg>	reduce: how much is "some"? and how complex?
<zomg>	if it's a fairly small amount and not very complex and you don't need to parse/process it in any way, string concatenation would be the simplest way to do it
<zomg>	but if you need something more advanced, you can probably find a bunch of modules for it on github
<reduce>	its the serialized representation of a workflow
<reduce>	it could be quite long i guess
<reduce>	my workflow is comprised of instances of certain types of activities
<reduce>	i was thinking of having a method to serialize each type
<reduce>	and then just walk the workflow graph calling the appropriate method
<ajf->	how can I detect if apply() is available?
<ajf->	('apply' in Function) ?
*	Torkable is now known as Guest49397
<zomg>	reduce: yeah that would work
<zomg>	ajf-: you can pretty much assume it is, unless you need to support something utterly crazy
<ajf->	ie8 is complaining about it
<ajf->	ah but it's in the context of a console  wrapper
<zomg>	it's supported since IE6
<ajf->	so it's obviusly missing
<zomg>	so if you're having problems with it, then the issue is somewhere else
<tommycannady>	hi :)
<tommycannady>	is there another name for arrays in javascript ?
<tommycannady>	or no
<Agamemnus>	so
<Agamemnus>	Before you ask, I half self-deported from CSS
<Agamemnus>	have*
<Agamemnus>	Now.
<Agamemnus>	What's the "in" way to vertically center divs?
<Agamemnus>	I have been using diplay:table and display:table-cell
<Agamemnus>	But, table is terrible
<Agamemnus>	flexbox? Is that still hot?
<forQuery>	getting hotter with each month :)
<Agamemnus>	I like http://zerosixthree.se/vertical-align-anything-with-just-3-lines-of-css/ but it uses a CSS transform.
<forQuery>	problem with css transforms for centering...
<Agamemnus>	That's potentially hinky for positioning
<Agamemnus>	yes, mouse positioning
<forQuery>	is often if your text is more than 50% the width of the container, it wraps
<zomg>	tommycannady: I'm not entirely sure why arrays would have another name, but no, they're just called arrays
<Agamemnus>	why not use overflow...?
<forQuery>	ive been using this inline block way
<forQuery>	because, flexbox still sucks for IE, even with autoprefixer
<Agamemnus>	so there have been like 2 or 3 versions of flexbox right?
<Agamemnus>	F IE.
<Agamemnus>	I just don't care
<zomg>	spacer gifs
<zomg>	best way to layout
<forQuery>	thats how i feel too
<zomg>	I had forgotten about spacer gifs until someone mentioned them last week
<zomg>	ah the memories
<zomg>	lol
<forQuery>	http://imgur.com/m2KLrW3 agamemnus, this way works well...
*	Beatzebub is now known as Beatzebub_afk
<ajf->	i like line-height for vertical centering
<ajf->	(:
<forQuery>	line-height:100vh; works great... till someone pulls up an iphone or android that isnt from 2015 :)
*	oddskill_afk is now known as oddskill
*	Guest49397 is now known as Torkable
<YoutubeAPI>	How can I add text to the end of a tag using jQuery?
<YoutubeAPI>	For example, let's say that a p tag shows "loading", and I want to append a . every 6 seconds to that tag.
<YoutubeAPI>	I guess I could do it the cheap way and get the text from the tag, and then append whatever text I need after.
<deltab>	YoutubeAPI: element, not tag, but yes
*	k4r1m is now known as xkb
<Nazral>	Is there some good crypto lib for javascript ?
<Sorella>	Nazral: in Node? Sure. In the browser? Not enough entropy (though browser vendors are trying to address that!)
<zomg>	Fun fact: Mega uses user inputs for entropy
<zomg>	(obviously not as the only source, but as an addition)
<GreenJello___>	mouse movement is de facto, but you often have to ask the user to wiggle the mouse and it doesn't work well on mobile
<zomg>	I wonder if there are any good directional microphones around 100'ish eur... I have a fairly good mic but it's super sensitive to all kinds of noise
<Torkable>	I thought most mics filter out background noise pretty well
<Torkable>	I know my bluetooth one does
<Torkable>	I have one on my motorcycle helmet and people can't even tell, I'll be going 70mph and they can't hear any wind or anything
<zomg>	Yeah if it's built to do that
<zomg>	sadly those that have good noise cancellation don't usually reproduce the sound so well in general
<Sorella>	Torkable: motorcycles are scary.
<Torkable>	can be I guess
<Torkable>	they are also very fun :)
<Sorella>	'fraid I've only experienced the scary part of them
<Torkable>	:(
<Torkable>	that's not good
<ahop>	Hello, I've added a <input type="file"> browse button
<ahop>	How to get the filename in JS?
<ahop>	to allow uploading of this file?
<ahop>	Do you know a good tutorial for this classic thing (browse / upload photo)
<Torkable>	I think if you google for it you will find a lot of info
<YoutubeAPI>	I'm not sure what to call this, but I've seen this done on other websites. It's when hovering over a button that can't be clicked and it shows like a crossed out sign on your cursor.
<Torkable>	that is a pretty common thing
<deltab>	YoutubeAPI: css cursor
<ahop>	Torkable: I did but the things I tried were not so
<Torkable>	which part, the file name
<Torkable>	?
<YoutubeAPI>	Perfect, thanks.
<Torkable>	I think its in `.value`
<ahop>	should I listen onchange?
*	itscassa is now known as itscassa|away
<Torkable>	<select element>.value should be file name
<s2013>	got a stupid question regarding js.. so when you have a js that someone just embeds on their page (like google analytics) .. what exactly does it do? does it send post request to an api
<ahop>	Torkable: it works indeed
<Torkable>	yay
<ahop>	but I was wrong: I'm not looking for the filename
<Torkable>	lol
<deltab>	s2013: yes
<ahop>	I'm looking for a way to uplaod it
<ahop>	:)
<ahop>	when I'll press a 2nd button "Upload"
<s2013>	deltab  so hwo do you make it secure cant someone send fake data?
<s2013>	like im familiar with how it works serverside.. but
<s2013>	i cant even google for it cause i dont kow what to google
<ahop>	how to upload the file selected with <input type="file"
<s2013>	ahop you need something serverside to handle the upload
<s2013>	the form would be multipart form
<s2013>	so you need to parse it
<ahop>	yes of course, there will be some PHP side checkings
<s2013>	k so what are you asking
<ahop>	to be sure file is not too big, etc. I can deal with that
<ahop>	how to start the uploading
<s2013>	just hit the submit button it would send a post request
<s2013>	or do you mean ajax file upload?
<ahop>	yeah
<deltab>	s2013: the script reads the window size etc., and sends that plus any custom data you add, with the url, GA cookie, etc. to Google's servers
<s2013>	https://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/ ahop
<s2013>	you can use that
<deltab>	referrer too
<s2013>	deltab GA is just an example.. so js can access someones cookie and ip and stuff?
<zomg>	s2013: JS can access cookies for the domain where the script is embedded... but not the IP address
<deltab>	not directly, but the request includes that implicitly
<s2013>	so how would i send over hte users ip via js? i just want o make it so an user can embed js
<s2013>	and i get access to users actions
<s2013>	their ip, session id, etc.
<deltab>	to ga?
<zomg>	you would handle it on your server as the request comes in, either when you receive the request for the script, or when the script sends data
<s2013>	not GA
<s2013>	ga is just an example
<zomg>	as at that point, your server is talking to the user's browser and can see the IP
<zomg>	so capturing the IP would have to be handled by a server side script
<s2013>	zomg yeah i know that part.. i can do it that way
<s2013>	but im curious as to how for example in google analytics you just embed a simple js and it has access to so much
<ahop>	s2013: I don't want ot use this library
<ahop>	I'm looking for the standard way
<ahop>	raw
<zomg>	s2013: it has access to everything JS can access :)
<s2013>	so i built a simple tool that allows people to give some tracking information.. it works for my own site.. but i want users to be able to just embed a js in their site
<zomg>	(and everything that's passed in in the http request to the server)
<zomg>	Well, the basic way of doing that would be fairly simple
<zomg>	You generate some ID for the user, then give them a script like <script src="domain.dom/tracker.js?id=put the user's id here"></script>
<s2013>	it works for my own site fine but thats cause im sending the data serverside, but i want to just be able to embed a js that does that so i dont need to hti an api
<s2013>	yeah
<s2013>	i got that part
<zomg>	that's how it works :) nothing more to it really

<zomg>	s2013: Yes, the browser does a normal HTTP GET request for the src attribute's URL
<s2013>	so i can get browser info and all that from that right
<zomg>	Yeah, if by "browser info and all that" you mean the User-Agent header, yes :)
<s2013>	k now how about custom info
<s2013>	so the username for example if user is logged in
<tomvolek>	deltab:   oh man ,  great, thats great...
<tomvolek>	deltab: reading the code.  Much appreciated .. I havent used JS for a long time, need to get back into it :)
<zomg>	s2013: well, you could make the script.js include some code like window.onload = function() { send an XMLHttpRequest to your API with any extra info; }
<s2013>	k zomg  thanks. let me see
<tomvolek>	deltab: where do  I send the check ?  :)
<s2013>	ill do some basic stuff and work my way up. thanks a lot for the help yall!
<zomg>	s2013: but don't use window.onload, you should use addEventListener since that will allow adding multiple handlers for it :)
<s2013>	i use js mostly on serverside.. not much frontend clientside person but i wanna get btter at it
<s2013>	better*
<zomg>	here's a couple of things I wrote about this topic as well http://codeutopia.net/blog/2012/05/26/best-practices-for-building-embeddable-widgets/
<zomg>	although not directly about collecting stats, most of the pointers there also apply for this case
<s2013>	oh nice
<s2013>	ill check it out
<s2013>	btw zomg do you write a lot
<s2013>	?
<zomg>	yeah I try to write a couple times a month but been a bit busy with some other stuff now so bit of a pause :)
<s2013>	oh ok. http://manning.com/vinegar/ from that link. intersting
<zomg>	I'm making a javascript unit testing course, so in addition to my full time job it doesn't leave much time to write
<s2013>	any idea bout that book?
<zomg>	hehe
<s2013>	zomg gotcha. well my company is looking for devs to write and get paid.. might be interesting if you are interested
<zomg>	first time I hear about that book :)

*	ormaaj_ is now known as ormaaj
<doug16k>	sadaN, you changed $("input") to something specific for your code, right?
<sadaN>	yeah, to the input where i want it to be triggered
<doug16k>	what are you expecting. letters to appear? that is not how it works
<doug16k>	if you want letters to appear in an input, set the value of the input
<sadaN>	thats not what i want
<doug16k>	what keystroke are you triggering?
<doug16k>	XY question
<sadaN>	i used keycode 13 (enter), and I expect to log in to a website
<sadaN>	some websites use ajax so theres no form to submit
<barhum2013>	I am looking to ask beginning students to build a simple javascript game without OOP in 6 hours.   Anyone have an idea of what might be doable?  They would have all the basic skills except OOP.  Thanks
<zomg>	barhum2013: tic tac toe is fairly simple
<barhum2013>	zomg: I was planning on that, but not sure of 6 hours is enough time…
<doug16k>	so, your problem is submitting a form that has no form, and you asked about injecting keyboard input. that is an XY question
<doug16k>	sadaN, why not put a form tag there and be done with it?
<zomg>	barhum2013: well going into even simpler, hangman might be easy as checking the answer might be simpler, or even simpler than that would be "guess the number" or something
<doug16k>	sadaN, if you would prefer not to, you can construct a form programmatically and submit it, or use ajax
<sadaN>	"and you asked about injecting keyboard input" I dont remember asking that
<barhum2013>	zomg: hangman sounds easier, thanks for the idea!
<doug16k>	triggering "enter" === "injecting keyboard input"
<sadaN>	dynamically creating a form around the fields and submitting it is not gonna work
<doug16k>	barhum2013, tic tac toe is pretty easy. too easy?
<doug16k>	an AI that never loses
<barhum2013>	doug16k: Well these students are going to be doing this exercise after about 40 hours of programming training.
<barhum2013>	doug16k: not sure if I am asking too much
<doug16k>	sadaN, yes it is gonna work
<doug16k>	I've done it
<doug16k>	but I have better things to do than convince you
<sadaN>	testing it now mate, no need to freak out
<sadaN>	thanks
<Tech1>	anyone good with chart.js? / is there a chart.js specific room i missed?
<sadaN>	doug16k: thanks for the tip, it did not work as expected though, it highly depends on how the website has been implemented
<sadaN>	www.icloud.com
<sadaN>	run these in the console, one at a time
<sadaN>	$("#sc2092").wrap("<form id='foobarForm'></form>");
<sadaN>	$("#foobarForm").submit();
<Tech1>	https://bpaste.net/show/e2dc989d45bc   is rendering the chart labels, but not the data, which is odd
<Tech1>	…I'm using labels wrong...
<Tech1>	nvm
<doug16k>	sadaN, try $("#foobarForm")[0].submit()
<doug16k>	jquery .submit should work though
*	Torkable is now known as Guest57240
<sadaN>	did not work with [0]
<sadaN>	mind you submit() did work with the code I pasted
<sadaN>	but icloud.com is just not implemented in away that allows it to work I think
<rcyr>	sadaN: Let me guess, you have an element with name="submit" somewhere?
<sadaN>	try the code I pasted and you'll see what mean, ull get an error message from icloud
<sadaN>	dunno
<sadaN>	It's icloud.com i havent seen their entire html
<sadaN>	this solutions causes https://www.icloud.com/not_found/
<doug16k>	sadaN, you are posting to the same domain?
*	Onionnio_ is now known as Onionnion
<sadaN>	gotta set POST in the <form>?
<sadaN>	or ACTION
<doug16k>	method="POST" for post. action is the url
<sadaN>	tried it like this
<doug16k>	form will reload the page though. is that undesirable?
<doug16k>	you can make it reload-less with ajax
<sadaN>	var outputUrl = window.location.href;
<sadaN>	$("#sc2092").wrap("<form action='"+outputUrl+"' method='post' id='foobarForm'></form>");
<sadaN>	$("#foobarForm").submit();
<sadaN>	this time i didnt get sent to /notfound
<sadaN>	icloud.com just got reloaded instead
<doug16k>	that input has a name?
<sadaN>	well, as long as I am able to log in, reloading would be fine
<doug16k>	only inputs with a name wull submit
<sadaN>	yes, both name and password fields have a name attribute
<doug16k>	disabled inputs wont submit either
<sadaN>	their not
<sadaN>	*they're
<doug16k>	sadaN, http://jsfiddle.net/nhznt2dq/

<b4b>	anyone on osx using chrome having freezing problems with chrome dev tools?
*	ricardolima is now known as riclima
<doug16k>	sadaN, http://jsfiddle.net/7ao7eg1v/
<doug16k>	each key of the "data" object you pass becomes a hidden input in the form
<doug16k>	property name is the key, value is the value of that property name
<sadaN>	alright
<doug16k>	b4b, if it freezes, I find that avoiding reload while stopped at a breakpoint helps stabilize it. if you want to restart, hit resume until you get out of the break then reload
