<shlant>	anyone know how i can debug this subprocess? status = subprocess.call(["/bin/bash", command, app_name, app_envs]) do i add stdout=pipe, stderr=pipe or something?
<_habnabit>	shlant, 'debug' in what way?
<shlant>	_habnabit: if the subprocess fails, i want the error. the doc note says i can't use stdout=pipe, stderr=pipe? https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.call
<shlant>	_habnabit: here's the relavent code block: https://gist.github.com/mrmmorris/01c7781acb3669378b05
<shlant>	i'm getting a 500, but i want to know why
<_habnabit>	shlant, subprocess.check_output
<shlant>	_habnabit: instead of subprocess.call?
<yvear>	shlant, windows?
<yvear>	oh nvm i see gist
<yvear>	shlant, did you print out whole command then try in term?
<shlant>	yvear: sorry, just testing what _habnabit suggested
<ranieri_>	yea
<boomdala>	hello
<boomdala>	has anyone read black hat python
<yvear>	boomdala, i read chapter 10 about elevating windows privileges
<jim>	_habnabit, around for some more stuff? what i might do is have docommand(int) in its own class, classes could inherit from it in order to get a docommand, and have any class that wants to be the target of commands to inherit from it
<yvear>	ha
<jim>	highest i've seen em
<boomdala>	did you use a diffrent python ide in kali
<_habnabit>	jim, requiring inheritance is rarely a good api
<mircx1>	hello i need please help about something
<boomdala>	what is it
<jim>	4 + 2 = 42
<mircx1>	i try install in ubuntu  python-chardet and i have error
<mircx1>	this my error
<mircx1>	http://pastebin.com/hgu81nez
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/vpyuno35d0vl5t8stdak/ (repasted for mircx1)
<jim>	what command produced it?
<mircx1>	someone?
<jim>	_habnabit, a class can inherit from it, or not (it's not required, except if the class wants to be the target of commands)
<_habnabit>	mircx1, i was waiting for more, because this error doesn't seem to be related to chardet
<yvear>	boomdala, what are you asking?
<zahlman>	mircx1: that's from *installing* it, not trying to use it?
<_habnabit>	jim, that sounds like 'required' to me
<mircx1>	ok but i try again doing what i need and again i have error
<shibe>	is there any distribution for pypy that comes with stuff installed?
<shibe>	like anaconda?
<shibe>	my lxml isnt installing on pypy either
<mircx1>	./usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/charade/universaldetector.py:83: unicodewarning: unicode equal comparison failed to convert both arguments to unicode -
<mircx1>	someone about charade
<malinoff>	shibe, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17341887/lxml-wont-install-under-pypy-using-easy-install
<mircx1>	how i fix this?
<shibe>	malinoff: anyways is there any distribution for pypy like anaconda?
<malinoff>	shibe, also, https://bitbucket.org/pypy/compatibility/wiki/lxml
<shibe>	i really like the stuff anaconda has
<_habnabit>	mircx1, why do you think this has anything to do with chardet?
<yvear>	mircx1, what command?
<mircx1>	beacuse i see error from there
<_habnabit>	mircx1, that's charade, not chardet
<malinoff>	shibe, i'm not aware about any anaconda-like distribution (although i never need one)
<shibe>	okay
<malinoff>	shibe, never had any troubles with pypy on linux
<shibe>	malinoff: hmm
<shibe>	i guess i'll have to install everything myself
<malinoff>	shibe, anaconda has very specific packages built-in (cience, math, engineering, data analysis)
<malinoff>	shibe, is it really difficult to pip install?
<shibe>	malinoff: it isn't but i was wondering if i could do this faster
<malinoff>	shibe, devpi server in your local network is the fastest solution
<shibe>	etree_defs.h(14) : fatal error c1083: cannot open include file: 'libxml/xmlversi
<shibe>	on.h': no such file or directory
<shibe>	._.
<malinoff>	shibe, also, the latest pip
<shibe>	malinoff: i installed pip and i've gotten most stuff installed
<malinoff>	shibe, have you read https://bitbucket.org/pypy/compatibility/wiki/lxml?
<shibe>	how do i use pip to download from github?
<malinoff>	shibe, pip install https://github.com/user/repo.git
<yvear>	what's the git+ for?
<shibe>	wait how do i download this https://github.com/amauryfa/lxml/tree/cffi
<shibe>	from pip
<malinoff>	shibe, that question is really 1 google request away
<shlant>	_habnabit: is this not what i want?
<shlant>	https://gist.github.com/mrmmorris/01c7781acb3669378b05
<shibe>	malinoff: it isnt installing http://hastebin.com/detufivaci.tex
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/hlrehvp3ursayrfjguny/ (repasted for shibe)
<malinoff>	shibe, try specific branch
<malinoff>	shibe, https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install.html#git
<shibe>	malinoff: so how would i turn this link into that https://github.com/amauryfa/lxml/tree/cffi
<shibe>	im confused
<malinoff>	shibe, please, read examples
<malinoff>	shibe, especially the part about branches
<overyander>	i have a py file that i can run as root and can run as an unprivileged user, but get permission errors when running from postfix. any ideas?
<yvear>	shlant, did you print out whole command then try in terminal?
<shlant>	yvear: are you referring to the bash command?
<yvear>	shlant, yes did you see exactly what it evaluates to?
<shibe>	this is taking forever cloning git://github.com/amauryfa/lxml.git (to cffi) to c:\pypy\bin\src\packag
<shibe>	it errored

<malinoff>	shibe, from the output: ** make sure the development packages of libxml2 and libxslt are installed **
<shibe>	malinoff: should i install this http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/files/libxml/
<shibe>	it's like 13 years old
<jim>	there;s another one, called lxml
<shibe>	jim: lxml isnt installing without libxml
<jim>	that's the python part, find out what libs it needs
<malinoff>	shibe, google -> windows libxml
<shibe>	jim:     ** make sure the development packages of libxml2 and libxslt are installed *
<shibe>	*
<shibe>	from the cmd
<jim>	yeah, install those and see
<jim>	what needs lxml?
<shibe>	omg
<shibe>	omg
<shibe>	easy_install installed lxml
<shibe>	it truly is easy
<jim>	yeah
<jim>	probably it installed the required libs too
<epequeno>	anyone ever made a saml client?
<shibe>	pypy crashed ._. http://i.imgur.com/kotati4.png
<epequeno>	or at least used python to auth to a saml resource?
<jim>	what's saml?
<epequeno>	basically a protocol for single sign on
<epequeno>	near as i can tell if you want to do it from python you'll either have to figure out how to verify cryptographically signed xml or use selenium/phantomjs to go the browser route (which is more common)
<shibe>	current issues:
<shibe>	pypy crashes on my  twisted irc bot

<epequeno>	rackspace! and totally not because i work for them
<yvear>	howardwlo, ovh
<jim>	shibe, i'm running a twisted bot with cpython, works fine
<howardwlo>	epequeno: i think, now, just thinking here, that you could be a teeny bit biased :d
<epequeno>	nope, totally biased
<howardwlo>	yvear: thanks!
<shibe>	jim: well i dont know whats wrong then
<lumber>	much biased
<howardwlo>	yvear: why ovh? :)
<shibe>	jim: http://i.imgur.com/liji2eo.png
<shibe>	crashing on the imports
<epequeno>	we do have some nice offerings: https://developer.rackspace.com/
<shibe>	and ujson wont install
<howardwlo>	haha ok, i’ll take a look ;) i suppose i don’t have to ask “why rackspace"
<epequeno>	and super cool hipster libraries http://gophercloud.io/
<yvear>	howardwlo, support and competitive prices
<shibe>	i found the issue
<shibe>	pypy crashes when i import lxml
<shlant>	yvear: the bash script is fine, but i want the subprocess to spit out any output resulting from the bash script
<shlant>	all i get is [29/apr/2015 05:33:46] "put / http/1.1" 500 -
<yvear>	shlant, output = subprocess.popen(["/bin/bash", command, app_name, app_envs], stderr=subprocess.pipe).communicate()[1].decode()
<yvear>	*i think*
<yvear>	shlant, lemme know if that works
<shlant>	yvear: nada. jsut the 500 error line https://gist.github.com/mrmmorris/a6afeff5fa7b0b2bd6ba
<yvear>	shlant, then try   output = subprocess.popen(["/bin/bash", command, app_name, app_envs], stdout=subprocess.pipe).communicate()[0].decode()
<yvear>	shlant, oh wait
<yvear>	shlant, did you print  'output'  variable?
<shlant>	https://gist.github.com/mrmmorris/0ace01a254f38fed0c23
<shlant>	yvear: i'm just using status instead of output
<yvear>	shlant, no, change stderr to stdout
<shlant>	yes
<shlant>	fking yes
<shlant>	you rock!
<yvear>	:)
<yvear>	np
<shlant>	yvear: now, any idea why i get a 400 with this? https://gist.github.com/mrmmorris/daa18b4dc503c8dc7ceb
<shlant>	kind of getting flask specific now..
<shlant>	basically, i want to pass post params to the bash script
<shlant>	using `curl -x put 0.0.0.0:10100 -d "appname=foo&appenv=bar"`
<sirlagz>	shlant: why do you want to pass post parameters to a bash script ? why not do the http request straight from python ?
<yvear>	shlant, sorry i'm only familiar with django
<shlant>	sirlagz: basically, that was suggested as the best worst way. this is an app that runs a bash script when kicked by post. i just am trying to modify it to accept params in the post that will set args for the bash script. not super elegant, i would rewrite the bash in python, but i need a mvp
<sirlagz>	shlant: righto then
<jim>	what's mvp
<epequeno>	minimum viable product
<epequeno>	'fucking ship it' in other words
<shlant>	sirlagz: haha understandable
<jim>	what in the bash script would be hard to rewrite?
<shlant>	jim: well with the time i've spen trying to get this to work, i'm asking myself the same question
<jim>	can you incorporate pieces of it at a time?
<shlant>	jim: haha well the bash script actually calls a python script already
<shlant>	i think i may just say fuck it
<jim>	um :)
<shlant>	and rewrite it
<shlant>	friggin bash
<shlant>	the flask app and bash script are working seperately
<shlant>	i just thought i'd be able to get the args passed with post for the time being
<shlant>	but i just can't figure it out
<shlant>	being a python noob
<shlant>	all i need is to read post params
<shlant>	maybe i'll ask #flask tomorrow
<epequeno>	can't you get that info from the response object or whaterver
<shlant>	epequeno: i am open to easier ways of doing things
<shlant>	i asked yesterday and this was suggested as the lesser of the evils
<epequeno>	umm the response data i think right? http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/api/#flask.response
<epequeno>	the docs say its deprecated so that's probably not what you're looking for
<shlant>	epequeno: i'll take a look, thanks. i need to sleep. thanks again for your help, yvear
<epequeno>	actually probaly the request data http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/api/#flask.request.data
<epequeno>	since its stuff being sent to the flask app (as i understand your setup)

<fearful>	i'm using debian 8 and i've changed over to dyamic motds
<fearful>	when i use python without importing anything it works without issue
<fearful>	but when i import anything it wont' load when you login
<fearful>	any idea why?
<l33t0>	how is debian 8 going for you fearful ?
<fearful>	... works fine why ..
<l33t0>	just wondering, bugs and all
<sirlagz>	l33t0: i've been using debian 8 for ages :p
<jim>	debianate!
<fearful>	hmm why won't this work when i use import
<l33t0>	sirlagz: using systemd?
<sirlagz>	l33t0: some are
<jim>	why what?
<sirlagz>	l33t0: i'm trying to avoid systemd though
<sirlagz>	l33t0: though admittedly, the ones running on systemd haven't had any systemd related issues
<l33t0>	thats my problem at the moment, i don't want to run things half/half
<sirlagz>	the ones i don't have running systemd are my system critical servers
<jim>	fearful, not quite understanding. are you getting a message when you import something?
<fearful>	i changed the /etc/motd to a custom one using /etc/update-motd.d and it's based on python instead of bash
<fearful>	what i'm trying to do is use python for sysinfo and so forth
<fearful>	when i import any kind of file with import
<fearful>	it doesn't load
<fearful>	it doesn't do anything but when i remove it it works no problem
<jim>	what does it have to say as to why?
<fearful>	it doesn't say anything
<fearful>	it doesn't give any errors
<jim>	hmm. what's wrong them?
<malinoff>	fearful, how you expect us to help you if you can't give us anything?
<fearful>	i don't know what's wrong that is
<fearful>	i just gave you the information
<fearful>	ugh
<malinoff>	fearful, there are literally zero information
<malinoff>	fearful, you can start from your motd script
<malinoff>	from showing*
<jim>	also it might be useful to know what it is you're trying to accomplish
<pcatinean>	hey guys i removed flake8 from pip and did sudo apt-get install python-flake8 and now when i type flake8 in the console is still searches in /usr/local/bin
<pcatinean>	anyone know why and how it can be fixed?
<_t0mb0_>	check your $path
<runciter>	pcatinean: you installed into /usr/local/bin somehow, perhaps with sudo easy_install or sudo pip, and /usr/local/bin is still in your path
<malinoff>	pcatinean, i wonder why did you install that system-wide
<pcatinean>	because i don't want to use virtual environments and the system one is more stable i guess
<runciter>	why don't you want to use virtual environments?
<pcatinean>	i'm just lazy :)))
<pcatinean>	no real good reason
<runciter>	this is way more work than using virtual environments!
<pcatinean>	i have to load them up etc
<malinoff>	pcatinean, then you'll have a lot of pain
<malinoff>	pcatinean, use virtualenvwrapper for good
<runciter>	pcatinean: pipsi
<pcatinean>	i guess that would be for the best yes
<pcatinean>	what is pipsi runciter ?
<runciter>	pcatinean: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi
<runciter>	if ~/.local/bin is in your path, it works fine
<pcatinean>	ah nice
<pcatinean>	it is in my path but still not working, i did install with pip and it starte working
<_t0mb0_>	do people not use pyenv any more or something?
<runciter>	_t0mb0_: pipsi solves a different problem
<_t0mb0_>	pyenv virtualenv?
<runciter>	_t0mb0_: it enables you to have a virtual environment per command, like pygments, but to still use those commands easily
<_t0mb0_>	virtualvenv i think it's called
<malinoff>	_t0mb0_, i use pyenv + virtualenvwrapper
<_t0mb0_>	malinoff, that's what i was refering to as well.
<_t0mb0_>	so pyenv to deploy python virtualvent to manage virtualenv
<malinoff>	_t0mb0_, ah, as runciter said, it solves a different problem
<_t0mb0_>	ok
<kosh>	i use virtual machines
<_t0mb0_>	kosh, vagrant is so damn slow to boot up :p
<_t0mb0_>	i guess i haven't run into the pygmentize problem outlined in the readme so don't fully understand
<asdf`>	(vagrant is the fast part, virtualbox on the other hand)
<runciter>	what we haven't all switched to the kvm provider
<kosh>	i don't have to start up vms very often
<_t0mb0_>	i don't have a server at home :(
<kosh>	on my system i can start up virtualbox in < 2 seconds with my python app running
<runciter>	kosh: what system?
<kosh>	just a laptop
<kosh>	for deployment i deploy to virtual machines that run for years at a time
<_t0mb0_>	i guess you're working with a fairly static infrastructure then?
<runciter>	kosh: maybe you've got a simpler base image than i do
<runciter>	i just timed vagrant up at 25 seconds
<sral>	how does type(object) determine the type?
<cluelessperson>	_t0mb0_, would you like something to practice on? :p
<malinoff>	sral, do you need specific c code?
<malinoff>	sral, or a general answer?
<sral>	malinoff: general... i see typeerror on something that is type 'undefined' and i'm wondering how that can even happen.
<kosh>	runciter, my virtualbox image is just a full ubuntu server install about 10g or so in size and i gave it a few gig of ram
<malinoff>	kosh, it can't start in < 2 seconds on 'just a laptop'
<malinoff>	kosh, define your laptop
<_t0mb0_>	cluelessperson, no thnx :p
<_t0mb0_>	most of my dev is django these days.
<_t0mb0_>	so pyenv works fine.
<kosh>	malinoff, 1tb ssd, 24g of ram, i7 quad core
<runciter>	kosh: i'm just surprised because i've got a pretty quick laptop
<malinoff>	sral, show your code
<runciter>	kosh: hm, your host system is some linux?
<malinoff>	kosh, my desktop has 256gm ssd, 8g of ram and i3 - you have a pretty quick laptop
<kosh>	windows 8.1 right now
<malinoff>	kosh, please, don't suggest people to use virtualbox to install flake8 within
<malinoff>	kosh, instead of using virtualenvwrapper
<sral>	malinoff: it's mako template library throwing typeerror: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'undefined' and 'undefined' and i wonder how that is even possible?
<kosh>	linux does not run as fast on my laptop, someething to do with the turbo on the cpu and the battery life is also cut by a lot
<runciter>	kosh: ah ha.  are you using virtualbox, really, or that fancy windows 8 hypervisor?
<kosh>	just virtualbox
<sral>	malinoff: i'd expect it to throw nameerror foo not defined.
<runciter>	interesting
<asdf`>	sral, while for `class x: ..`,  `type(x)` would show you the metaclass that made x, a typeerror would typically just show x instead
<runciter>	kosh: well thanks for showing me what i'm missing, now i want to speed up my dumb vagrant boxes
<asdf`>	sral, this must mean you rendered a mako template but didn't pass in the names; btw. jinja has a strict mode that would throw an error when encountered an undefined name, maybe mako has a strict mode as well?
<kosh>	back in a minute
<holygoat>	runciter: what was it that you were missing?
<runciter>	holygoat: oh, he's got some vagrant boxes that use virtualbox as a provider that come up in ~2 seconds
<runciter>	holygoat: mine take around 30
<holygoat>	ah ok
<sral>	asdf`: yeah, i'm just trying to get my head around what's missing and mako code is not easy to follow.
<runciter>	pretty irrelevant :)
<asdf`>	sral, it seems you can pass `template(..., strict_undefined=true)`
<sral>	asdf`: thanks, will have a look.
<holygoat>	you could also use docker/compose, you'll have containers in under a second generally
<runciter>	holygoat: oh, i use vagrant for the dopes on my team who insist on using macs ;)
<_t0mb0_>	runciter, boot2docker?
<holygoat>	runciter: ah okay; i use a mac, with docker
<runciter>	oh, it does that now?
<holygoat>	well i use a mac privately, my work desktop is linux
<holygoat>	runciter: with boot2docker
<runciter>	also, for "containers" i usually just use lxc
<holygoat>	fair enough
<runciter>	holygoat: but since i don't use docker, i'll ask: you find boot2docker works pretty well?
<kosh_>	i use linux servers and windows laptops now mostly and macs are just not an option with a lot of the software that i run
<runciter>	_t0mb0_: and you, does boot2docker work ok for you?
<_t0mb0_>	do you see many issues deving in docker but releasing to production in a vm? or do you use docker for production?
<holygoat>	runciter: never really had any problems with it, plus i like not having to use some privileged user to start docker containers
<_t0mb0_>	runciter, it does the job. but using it as any sort of baseline for how production will be doesn't sit right for me.
<malinoff>	_t0mb0_, don't use docker in production
<holygoat>	the battery consumption is pretty okay too, i can use it for hours on my macbook air while on the train
<runciter>	malinoff: :d
<_t0mb0_>	but as i said, my projects haven't required docker yet. i'm mainly doing web dev so pyenv does the trick.
<runciter>	fair enough
<_t0mb0_>	i've had a play trying to get zimbra to work in a container but failed.
<holygoat>	i use docker in an open source project of mine, but not to deploy applications to production (yet, that might change)
<_t0mb0_>	but i think i failed due to the limited resources in my digital ocean droplet more than the implementation.
<malinoff>	it's more #python-offtopic, but docker is broken on so many levels, don't even think to manage your app with it, you'll hardly fail
<triotorus>	why are people reluctant to use docker in production when they already use it for dev?
<_t0mb0_>	triotorus, for one, it consumes a lot of data. adds extra complexity.
<kosh_>	if it was so broken why are so many using it?
<_t0mb0_>	my experience with it in a vps environment
<malinoff>	kosh_, because everybody is talking about it
<runciter>	kosh_: wait a few years
<malinoff>	kosh_, and only a few who really use it
<kosh_>	ah
<triotorus>	_t0mb0_: how do you mean, ‘consumes a lot of data’? it’s a lightweight wrapper.
<malinoff>	from the prod perspective, it doesn't solve any problems, but it brings more
<_t0mb0_>	i think using the docker hub sucks, but if you had the time to build your own images off a common base image it could work.
<shibe>	doing "from lxml import html" crashes pypy
<shibe>	:/
<holygoat>	_t0mb0_: we have our own internal docker repository, and use docker images to create clean builds from jenkins
<holygoat>	but we don't use containers in production
<runciter>	shibe: which lxml?  the cffi one?
<_t0mb0_>	triotorus, i was using a do ubuntu droplet, i then attempted to build a zimbra container that inherits from the base ubuntu image. it consumed an extra 11gb or something.
<shibe>	runciter: yes
<runciter>	hmmmmm
<xiaomiao>	docker is shiny ... shiny attracts cats, err, people
<_t0mb0_>	i had build incosistincies using boot2docker locally and docker on my droplet.
<xiaomiao>	mostly works around bad package managers and such things
<shibe>	runciter: i actually just did easy_install lxml
<shibe>	because i wasnt able to install the cffi one
<runciter>	shibe: how did pypy crash?
<shibe>	runciter: http://i.imgur.com/gxsvrly.png
<_t0mb0_>	as in it worked with b2d and didn't in my droplet.
<triotorus>	why i consider docker: i try to manage multiple virtualenvs in a production server. i have to source a virtualenv everytime i want to run something on production. that makes for a very incompatible deployment workflow.
<_t0mb0_>	i ended up just using ansible to deploy my mail solution.
<_t0mb0_>	triotorus, is this a private server?
<malinoff>	triotorus, you don't have to source it
<the-compiler>	triotorus: you don't have to source the activate script, just use ./yourvenv/bin/python
<triotorus>	_t0mb0_: nope
<_t0mb0_>	what provider if you don't mind my asking?
<malinoff>	triotorus, simply specify the full path to the python interpreter within your venv
<_t0mb0_>	and the tier?
<_t0mb0_>	or if you use pyenv just pyenv local
<_t0mb0_>	and cd into the dir
<malinoff>	i'd suggest to not use pyenv in prod too
<triotorus>	the-compiler: correct, but i’m following 12factor, which means my django settings read from the environment. when using the python interpreter from the virualenv, this doesn’t mean those variables get read in.
<_t0mb0_>	malinoff, do you suggest tailor made vms?
<_t0mb0_>	or custom compiled python environments?
<malinoff>	_t0mb0_, well, no
<malinoff>	_t0mb0_, i suggest to use proper packages
<runciter>	triotorus: variable1=value1 variable2=value2 .... /path/to/venv/bin/python -m your thing
<triotorus>	i know there is virtualenvwrapper with postactive scripts  and the like, but that gets dirty soon.
<malinoff>	_t0mb0_, e.g. you can have python3 even on centos6 with scl
<runciter>	triotorus: but why are you running things by hand in production?  debugging?
<_t0mb0_>	malinoff, but what if you require upstream changes to the vendor packages?
<malinoff>	_t0mb0_, like what?
<malinoff>	_t0mb0_, define 'vendor packages'
<triotorus>	runciter: yes, on a staging server, i want to turn on debug easily or just change some stuff. so admittedly this is more for staging servers than the real production server.
<_t0mb0_>	malinoff, so you have centos x with python2.7.x, but there is a show stopper bug for a python module you require in that particular version of python.
<_t0mb0_>	malinoff, i hope that made sense :/ disclaimer: i'm not a professional developer.
<malinoff>	_t0mb0_, well, if you define the issue like that, then yes, compiling your own python is the way to go
<malinoff>	_t0mb0_, but in the real world, you unlikely to face them
<_t0mb0_>	malinoff, true.
<_t0mb0_>	to date my django work i've been pushing to heroku free tier
<malinoff>	_t0mb0_, also, don't use python 2
<_t0mb0_>	malinoff, it was an example ;)
<malinoff>	_t0mb0_, bad example :)
<_t0mb0_>	i do need to work out my deployment strategy for my do droplet :d
<_t0mb0_>	i think using system python should be fine though.
<malinoff>	the biggest issue with pyenv on prod is that you have to install "development tools" like gcc
<jim>	_t0mb0_, often it's useful to know the range of versions that work with your app
<jim>	and often that's a wide range
<_t0mb0_>	jim, yeah i can see it's value in debugging issues.
<runciter>	malinoff: you can't use wheels?
<malinoff>	runciter, for python programs - yes, i can
<jmakov>	hi. how do you guys monitor your script in production? do you write events to the db or is there a better way?
<malinoff>	runciter, but we're talking about python itself
<runciter>	malinoff: i would say the bigger problem is lack of atomicity -- you have twiddle a symlink or something
<xmj>	morning
<xmj>	is there a python library which allows me to output arbitrary notes (think a->440hz) via sox?
<jim>	_t0mb0_, for that reason, somewhat older versions of things which still work, you should consider carefully before upgrading
<jim>	like, maybe python-3.3 or -3.4.0 (if it works with your app), most likely you should just keep it for awhile longer... do you find yourself wanting to always upgrade to the latest version of everything?
<jim>	and that's especially true on a production server: the only way you should replace it, is from the staging server, where you tested everything first
<_t0mb0_>	jim, for my dev tools and env i typically find myself deploying latest stable through brew or yauort
<_t0mb0_>	but for python i typically just install through pyenv whatever debian stable is at.
<_t0mb0_>	although my personal blog which i host on heroku i don't need to worry so much about the infrastructure.
<jim>	that's ok, as long as you're extremely careful about production, and you do not replace any individual piece without testing all the pieces first
<jim>	anyway. that's my 2cents
<shibe>	how to do a for loop in cython?
<jim>	it's not just a regular for loop? show what you're trying
<skeletonking>	hello. im new to using classes and am now trying to use classes for a code i got owrking without classes..
<shibe>	jim: was wondering if there was any other way
<skeletonking>	im trying to show a bunch of pictures in a screen made of tkinter. the screen shows up but not the frame with my pictures
<skeletonking>	someone have any input? https://bpaste.net/show/99b19e803aae
<jim>	i ca 't see the first way... if i tell you the first way by mistake, not knowing what you've tried yet, would you resent that?
<ldlework>	anyone familiar with pygments? when i lex some python, i don't get any tokens more specific than token.name. what gives?
<ssbr>	ldlework: what do you get if you lex "1 < 3"?
<isaac_rks>	what is pythons position on gay marriage
<the-compiler>	isaac_rks: i don't think a programming language has a position on political topics
<ssbr>	isaac_rks: pretty sure python has been used to implement software that espoused positions both for and against. ;)
<isaac_rks>	i only want to use software made by people with the same opinions as me
<riderplus>	isaac_rks what side is python on?
<ssbr>	isaac_rks: python is made by people with crazy opinions
<riderplus>	right or left?
<isaac_rks>	riderplus that's what worries me
<ssbr>	some people that wrote python believe that you should statically type python code
<jim>	we pit them against each other and send their output to /dev/null
<riderplus>	what?
<riderplus>	jim that's like sending the output to garbage
<isaac_rks>	how can i continue to use my favourite language if gvr is an opponent of homosexual matrimony
<jim>	it's garbage anyway
<ssbr>	isaac_rks: separation of concerns
<ldlework>	ssbr: token.literal.number.integer
<ldlework>	which seems pretty specific
<ssbr>	but anyway, the psf is very accepting of the lgbtq community.
<isaac_rks>	my brain is spaghetti code
<riderplus>	haha yes
<ssbr>	ldlework: so, does that mean the problem is not reproduced here?
<ldlework>	ssbr: its more for "a = 5", why is a parsed as just token.name
<ldlework>	and not token.name.variable
<jim>	isaac_rks, do you want to pass the turing test?
<ldlework>	it seems most of the code is just parsed as token.name
<ldlework>	so i can't set colors very granularly
<isaac_rks>	what if i dont
<riderplus>	then you're screwed :p
<isaac_rks>	the turing test is human privilege
<isaac_rks>	why should a viagra spam bot have to pretend theyre human to achieve equal rights
<isaac_rks>	turing should have been more sensitive
<riderplus>	isaac_rks what does it consist of?
<riderplus>	i'm not having a clue about the turing test...is it to identify if a human being is human?
<jim>	that's what it looks like... you haven't passed yet. so if you have interest in python, start expressing that interest by going to python.org
<the-compiler>	riderplus: yes
<the-compiler>	isaac_rks: you might want to take this to #python-offtopic
<ldlework>	ssbr: do you get the same thing?
<riderplus>	i thought python.org is here
<riderplus>	:p
<isaac_rks>	what is the topic
<isaac_rks>	of this channel
<jaantr>	is this the right place to ask for help with pandas?
<riderplus>	that's why i want to learn from here
<jim>	isaac_rks, /topic
<the-compiler>	isaac_rks: questions about the python programming language and related things
<isaac_rks>	but i was asking a question about the python progrmming language
<jim>	we'll agree to disagree
<isaac_rks>	therefore, it follows that i'm not off topic :^)
<jaantr>	how do i get the value of a cell in pandas and convert it to an int so that i can use it for calculations? this is what i've done so far - https://bpaste.net/show/e5a75dfad42a
<isaac_rks>	lel rekt
<jim>	again we'll agree to disagree
<riderplus>	jaantr let me see
<riderplus>	just a sec
<skeletonking>	someone can help me with why my frame containing pictures won't show? https://bpaste.net/show/99b19e803aae
<skeletonking>	i got this working without classes. but i'm new to using them so trying to learn how to use'em,
<riderplus>	jaantr what do you try to accomplish?
<jmakov>	hi. if a decorated method is a base class is overwritten in a subclass, is it still decorated?
<jaantr>	riderplus: so i've got the table from here, http://www.atpworldtour.com/rankings/top-matchfacts.aspx?y=2015&s=1#, using beautifulsoup, then i've made that a dataframe with pandas now i want to query it so i can get the 1st serve percentage for the player novak djokovic and turn that cell, from a percentage to a decimal so i can use it in calculations.
<jim>	skeletonking, sec, i'm trying to run it
<jim>	so for me, some of the image files are not found, and so i can't run it at the moment... let me work on it a bit
<skeletonking>	udnerstandable. they're located locally on my computer. i get the main window up when im running it. but, the pictures won'rt show
<skeletonking>	i am trying to create a frame in the __init__ function in mainframe class (self.frame = frame(self.parent)
<jim>	ok, one sec
<skeletonking>	doesn't seem like it's working
<jim>	is the main frame showing up?
<riderplus>	i don't see how you can double attribute df on the same line of code. but maybe that's just me seeing it wrong. explain if i wasn't too clear
<jaantr>	riderplus: i don't understand it fully either, i've never used pandas before yesterday and the code doesn't work without the second df.
<skeletonking>	jim:yes, the main frame shows up
<naxa>	argparse how do i identify which subcommand was specified eg. "python prog.py foo"  where `foo` is a subcommand and i do `parser.parse_args()`
<skeletonking>	so there is a tk windows showing up. although the frame where i want to put the pictures doesn't seem to show up in the window
<jaantr>	riderplus: in sql i'd just do, select 1st srv from df where player = 'novak djokovic'
<riderplus>	i see. well, you need to use the second df on a separate line. attribute djokovic to player then it should work
<jim>	ok, so one thing you can do is look at the docs for the data type which the main frame is. see if there is a method of the class that gets invoked when either showing the frame or initializing the frame
<jaantr>	riderplus: sorry i'm not following, how would i do that?
<danjou>	for your amusement: when js people write python code: http://paste.ubuntu.com/10937068/
<riderplus>	please send me a panda function that i can use for similar situations
<riderplus>	first send me the function, i'll come up with a reply
<jim>	while you're doing that i'll try to get one pic into the frame
<jaantr>	riderplus: i don't know what you mean, i have this at the moment but you've seen it already - c = df[["1st srv"]][df['player'] == 'novak djokovic']
<naxa>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/dzontcoujpoqr4pstvlc/ how do i check whether 'unittest' subparser was selected?
<riderplus>	yes. you need to find a way to place the second df on a separate line before the panda function. then you'll need to use it in the panda function itself
<jaantr>	riderplus: like this? https://bpaste.net/show/e41506b8521b
<munstur>	hi
<munstur>	n00b question
<danjou>	munstur: i think that's up to us to classify questions ;)
<munstur>	i've got an auth function which somehow stops whole function
<qiyong>	hi, help
<the-compiler>	qiyong: well, ask ;)
<riderplus>	jaantr yes, exactly!!
<danjou>	munstur: i'd classify this question as "is not a question" ;)
<munstur>	...and i just want that main function to proceed further with skipping
<qiyong>	hi, help. i'm using toscawidgets to display an error message, which widget should i use? textfield or lable?
<munstur>	not breaking
<danjou>	munstur: show code please
<jaantr>	riderplus: it doesn't fix the issue of me not knowing how to use the result of the query in calculations
<munstur>	danjou: ok, just a sec
<jaantr>	it's still returning   1st srv 0     62%
<qiyong>	the-compiler: ?
<riderplus>	jaantr then you need to find a different function to supply for it
<the-compiler>	qiyong: i have no idea about toscawidgets i'm afraid
<riderplus>	of course it returns the same if the csv doesn't change
<riderplus>	;)
<jaantr>	riderplus: haha yeah, i meant it returns the column and row names too as opposed to just 62% which i what i want
<riderplus>	oh ok...you need to refer to a different panda function. have a look at the docs again
<jaantr>	riderplus: i've been looking but can't see one which does what i want. do you know what one i need?
<riderplus>	try a function that helps you prevent the split of df
<riderplus>	that should do it
<riderplus>	i'm not sure about which one panda function can do that, but it's worth searching
<jim>	skeletonking, still here? one thing i found is that the path entry needs to end with a /, or each image ref begin with / or the code that combines has to put a / inbetween
<jim>	another: i'm getting the images from the sites as pngs and right now the frame class doesn't know how to png
<jim>	i have another suggestion: if you're trying to learn how classes work, ones that are really complicated won't help you if you get mired in the details of the complications... so, you might pick much simpler examples
<skeletonking>	jim: yes jim im still here. thank you for the input. i was jsut caught up in some work..
<skeletonking>	jim:i converted the pictures to .gifs which shouidl be working
<skeletonking>	as already mentioned i got the same code working but without the classes. but i'm guessing there's something wrong when initializing my frame
<mdoge>	hello python boys and girls, i have a question, how do i print hello world?
<sokoli>	mdoge: quickly.
<mdoge>	sokoli: ack :-)
<edlinde>	http://pastie.org/10119858
<edlinde>	can someone help me with this error?
<edlinde>	i am not exactly sure how to call this lsh in nearpy lsh implementation
<ssbr>	mdorenka: print "hello world"
<willisman>	ssbr: got scared off
<ssbr>	ooppppps
<ssbr>	sorry mdorenka
<huig>	hello, is there a way i can replace the loop with a numpy function? http://pastebin.com/9kqi7h7n
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/ryrbttujzuxylah4gvkp/ (repasted for huig)
<edlinde>	any ideas about my code?
<_myth>	how can i write to a file in asnyc mode in python 2.x ?
<ssbr>	_myth: what do you mean async mode?
<timkofu>	there is a decorator x that can be applied to any function; how can i apply it to a libabry function? coz usually decorators are applied af function creation time
<ssbr>	timkofu: wrapped_library_function = decorator(library.function)
<_myth>	i use nignx + tornado to hold large file upload
<_myth>	i want to write a log of data to local disk, how can it be non-blocked?
<_myth>	i want to write a lot of data to local disk, how can it be non-blocked?
<ssbr>	_myth: write it in a separate thread
<_myth>	i need to write to a single file
<mackan90096>	is there any tool to minify python?
<mackan90096>	like, online.
<mackan90096>	kinda like uglifyjs
<petazz>	hi! i was playing around and thinking, is there a neat way of creating a class to implement this sort of method chaining: "speaker = speaker(); speaker.say("hello").to("mary")
<petazz>	the problem is can i maintain the context of the previous call somehow?
<malinoff>	mackan90096, err, why?
<mackan90096>	malinoff: to make it a oneliner.
<malinoff>	mackan90096, you can't
<mackan90096>	i have a irc bot executing python.
<mackan90096>	malinoff: oh.
<mackan90096>	okay then.
<mackan90096>	why not
<mackan90096>	?
<malinoff>	mackan90096, spaces and newlines are significant
<malinoff>	mackan90096, that's how python works
<mackan90096>	oh, right.
<s1dev>	petazz: if you have a sort of verb/subject object
<s1dev>	then you could have
<s1dev>	say() returns a verb
<s1dev>	"verb" type
<s1dev>	*say modifies speaker
<s1dev>	then to() would have to as well
<s1dev>	but tbh that's pretty pointless
<s1dev>	it seems nice and there's some examples of it that are well done (somewhere in c#, can't think right now)
<petazz>	s1dev: but essentially it would have to return someting else than "self" right?
<s1dev>	it could, yeah
<malinoff>	petazz, you can return whatever you want, until that thing has 'to' method
<barneygale>	petazz, yes, because it needs to track state (i.e. "say" and "hello")
<s1dev>	a "verb" type that has a method 'to'
<huig>	is there a way i can substitute the loop for a numpy function? http://pastebin.com/aq35qqfy
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/l0g15viw4oyijg1dxxv6/ (repasted for huig)
<titou>	hello
<titou>	i'm looking for a nice solution to generate diploma in pdf format from a template (in which format?)
<timkofu>	ssbr: thanks
<titou>	the template may contains everything (pictures, text etc.) and some part of the text could contains some tricks which will be easily found by a python code in order to be replace by user name, birth date etc.
<skeletonking>	jim:i don't know if you got my recent msg's jim, i got disconnected
<titou>	in my first idea, i though about drawing the diploma under svg and use some keywords in the text like #username#
<titou>	unfortunately flowed text is not part of the svg 1.1 standard..
<titou>	and cairosvg nor svglib don't support inkscape flowed text...
<titou>	does someone has a better idea?
<phrearch>	hey
<titou>	maybe it is possible to load the svg from cairosvg and try to set manually flowed text with cairo routines but i'm not sure if it's possible..
<titou>	and the cairosvg documentation is not very understandable about its api :(
<karstenk>	hi,  someone here have any suggestions to that error  > /usr/lib/python2.7/ssl.py(352)wrap_socket()
<karstenk>	-> _context=self)
<phrearch>	im trying to import a package(django) from another package. both are installed in the virtualenv's site-packages dir. however, it seems that it cant find the django package from the other package. any idea if i need to add something in the manifest file for that?
<timkofu>	ssbr: for closure, async_mail = celery.shared_task(django.core.mail.send_mail)
<obr7>	hi. how to get shared outlook calendars? win32com.client shows me only local calendars! https://bpaste.net/show/5ccfaa21af21
<moldy>	phrearch: need more details
<nikhil_>	phrearch, are you installing from pip?
<nikhil_>	yeah
<voodoonofx>	obr7: i've only done it through pyexchange
<moldy>	phrearch: with the virtualenv active "python -c 'import django'" throws an error?
<obr7>	voodoonofx: cool do you know the parent id for shared folders? "shared" doesnt work and "calendar" shows only local calendars.
<phrearch>	moldy: yea, that works ok. i just moved some testcase code to another package (ghost.py), which then needs django from that package
<phrearch>	nikhil_: no, python setup.py develop
<moldy>	phrearch: show code and traceback
<phrearch>	basically modifying https://github.com/jeanphix/ghost.py  to have ./ghost/test/django.py which imports django
<voodoonofx>	obr7: you can use stuff like this (http://timgolden.me.uk/pywin32-docs/html/com/help/active_directory.html) to auto-discover objects, then get the id
<timvde>	titou: have you thought about latex?
<obr7>	voodoonofx: thanks. i come back later if it does not work.
<titou>	timvde: latex could be an idea but the problem is that it's "too long" to compile and it's a big thing to install on a server...
<phrearch>	moldy: https://paste.kde.org/pu439zllw
<timvde>	titou: latex itself is not *that* big, just don't install the hundreds of megabytes of docs that comes with it :p
<titou>	timvde: i will need to generate hundred of diplomae and i can't wait something like ten seconds to generate a pdf
<timvde>	titou: how long is "too long"?
<malinoff>	titou, python won't be any faster
<titou>	timvde: i know very well latex i only use it for all my document and presentation..
<titou>	the big advantage of an svg file is that anyone can take a software like inkscape to draw it and easily update it
<timvde>	the big advantage of latex is that anyone can take a text editor like vim (hehe, "anyone") and easily update it? :p
<phrearch>	probably need to instruct find_packages
<titou>	malinoff: once the svg file is loaded into memory i'm pretty sure that it's very quick to convert it into pdf
<danjou>	is that ugly or pythonic? for i, a, b in zip(itertools.count(), [1,2,3],[4,5,6]): ...
<titou>	timvde: it's not the right way :)
<moldy>	phrearch: don't name your module django.py
<timvde>	titou: okay, it was the only suggestion i have, so good luck with finding something :)
<malinoff>	danjou, depending on what exactly are you trying to do
<titou>	timvde: oh :(
<danjou>	malinoff: exactly what this does
<moldy>	phrearch: your module shadows the django package
<danjou>	malinoff: i need the index and i want to zip 2 lists
<danjou>	enumerate doesn't work for me here because i can't unpack it nicely in a for loop
<naxa>	got it here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/29938774/611007
<titou>	timvde: and you don't know cairo? maybe it's easy to create a flowed text arera?
<titou>	-r
<malinoff>	danjou, for i, (a, b) in enumerate(zip(l1, l2))
<fladd>	hi there, can anyone tell me how to match "c" and "c++" but not "c+" in a regex? "c(\+\+)?" does not work, as it also matches "c+" for some reason...
<timvde>	titou: no experience with it, sorry
<titou>	thank you :)
<danjou>	malinoff: that looks nicer, thanks!
<willisman>	fladd: c(\+{2})?
<bsmithers>	fladd: are you using regex.match rather than regex.fullmatch?
<fladd>	i am using match, yes
<bsmithers>	fladd: you need to use fullmatch if you want to match the entire string
<willisman>	fladd: or put ^ and $ on the beginning and end
<bsmithers>	fladd: otherwise any string with a c anywhere will match the regex
<fladd>	the weird thing is that c(++) will match correctly. but adding the ?, to make the ++ optional will result in also matching c+. can anyone explain to me why?
<bsmithers>	fladd: because it matches the c anywhere within the string. so all of these would return a match: "c", "c+", "hello c world"
<fladd>	or in other words: why does "(hello)?" also match "hell"?
<celelibi>	because it matches hello and the empty string.
<celelibi>	which any string is full of. :)
<fladd>	this still matches c+: "^(objective-)?c[#|(\+{2})]?$"
<celelibi>	fladd: an optional pattern at the begining or the end of a string may even be not there, it's still the same.
<fladd>	so can you construct a regexp that will mathc "objective-c", "c", and "c++"?
<celelibi>	".*" matches it.
<edlinde>	can someone here help me with a scipy problem?
<celelibi>	you have to be more specific.
<kibad>	is there an algorithm/design that limits sessions count established from client to server?
<edlinde>	http://pastie.org/10119939
<edlinde>	have the code + the errror i get pasted in there
<celelibi>	fladd: "^(objective-c|c|c\+\+)$" may be what you want.
<edlinde>	any clue as to what this error means: typeerror: no supported conversion for types: (dtype('o'), dtype('float64'))
<s1dev>	kibad: assign each connection a unique token, then track to heart's content
<fladd>	thanks celelibi! that works
<celelibi>	is there an easy way to replace a string by another in a file?
<edlinde>	anyone? :)
<bsmithers>	edlinde: can you convert the matrix to a full rather than sparse matrix? the error message means that numpy doesn't know how to convert from an object to a float.
<bsmithers>	celelibi: sed?
<edlinde>	nah i cannot
<edlinde>	its way too large
<edlinde>	but which object is it trying to convert?
<celelibi>	bsmithers: the current code uses subprocess to call sed after building its arguments.
<edlinde>	i am not getting that
<celelibi>	it's really ugly.
<celelibi>	and all we have to replace is static strings, no need for complex pattern matching.
<bsmithers>	edlinde: well then i think you cannot use those methods. i'm afraid i don't know if there are equivalents in scipy that work with sparse matrices.
<edlinde>	cannot use which methods?
<bullicon>	celelibi: "".replace
<bsmithers>	edlinde: the error is generated from the hash_vector method
<edlinde>	yep i saw that
<celelibi>	bullicon: so i'll have to iterate over all the lines and apply my transformations?
<edlinde>	its computing a normal

<bsmithers>	celelibi: you could read the entire file into a string if it's not too large
<edlinde>	bsmithers, if you look at the tests they generate.. it looks like they can handle sparse matrices
<celelibi>	bsmithers: but what if i have several placeholders to replace and the result of one matches the name of another placeholder?
<bullicon>	or you could map(lambda x: x.replace('foo', 'baz'), lines)
<celelibi>	to be clean, i have some things like "#somename#" to replace with a given value.
<celelibi>	if the value looks like "#someothername#" it may get replaced.
<seylerius>	what happens if you pass unnecessary keyword args to "".format()?
<sokoli>	seylerius: try it.
<seylerius>	sokoli: hah!
<seylerius>	it just ignores them! that's fscking perfect. i can have a file that just specifies a mess of format strings that use any combination of available keys and pass in a **dict! w1n.
<deadsix27>	whats the best way to parse timezone strings, such as gmt-5? i couldn't find a good way in pytz (yet) does anyone here have more info on that?
<seylerius>	deadsix27: try out arrow
<seylerius>	deadsix27: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/arrow/
<seylerius>	it makes timestamps just work.
<notnola>	hey thank seylerius!
<seylerius>	notnola: are you formerly of new orleans? (only use of nola that i'm aware of, at least)
<notnola>	that is correct.
<seylerius>	interesting. likewise.
<notnola>	any interest in netsec or the like?
<seylerius>	bailed to oakland, then ne oregon.
<seylerius>	yeah.
<notnola>	https://nolacon.com/
<deadsix27>	seylerius: does it allow parsing just strings like "gmt-7"
<notnola>	sec convention going down june 12-15
<seylerius>	notnola: interesting. not likely i'll be back in nola around then, but if so i'll be sure to pass by.
<notnola>	agreed - i am living in eastern florida now, i am how ever planing on attending that convention just for the lock picking stuff :p
<bsmithers>	celelibi: so you do not want to replace a replacement? in that case i think you'll have to find all occurrences of each string before applying any changes. to do that i'd probably stick with a regex, although you could use repeated calls to string.find
<bsmithers>	edlinde: you're right, it does look that way. if you run their tests do they work?
<celelibi>	annoying. :(
<cast>	i'm collecting the frequency count of letters in a string via for letter in string: if letter in dict: dict[letter] += 1 else dict[letter] = 1. it doesn't feel very pythonic, anyone have any other suggestions?
<wleslie>	cast: collections.counter
<seylerius>	deadsix27: it'll convert times from one zone to another with strings like "+07:00" or "-0700"
<seylerius>	which are an easy transform away from "gmt+7"
<cast>	wleslie: great :) thanks
<_mb>	hi; i'm trying to override __init__ in a few classes, eg. https://bpaste.net/show/ab5fd75ece3f ; as i'll need to call super's __init__ each time, is there something less repetitive than https://bpaste.net/show/ffa11cde77c4 ?
<_mb>	(or maybe, a better code organisation?)
<wleslie>	_mb: not in python 2, no
<_mb>	aw, ok then
<|zz|>	_mb: in python3 you have super()
<deadsix27>	seylerius: what part of arrow are you talking about exactly, because according to its documentation, its only able to parse full timestrings, including the timezone, which i don't try to parse
<_mb>	good to know (can't use python3 though)
<wleslie>	_mb: if a will always be subclassed, a.__init__ could call a method that does further initialisation
<seylerius>	deadsix27: if you've already got a timestamp that's in one timezone, it will convert that to another timezone with a string like i described.
<wleslie>	_mb: like self.further_setup(*args, **kwargs)
<|zz|>	wleslie: just out of curiosity, would it be possible to define a decorator, say @extend, which will allow that with a cleaner syntax? (i don't know much about decorators)
<deadsix27>	seylerius: i don't, i only have a string exactly saying gmt-7 or utc+1 or cest or another timezone
<|zz|>	wleslie: eg: @extend; def __init__(self): ...
<wleslie>	_mb: oh, you're only overriding one method?
<wleslie>	_mb: certainly not for calling super, because there's no way to figure out what the first argument should be.
<seylerius>	deadsix27: and what are you trying to do with this—normalize it into a standardized tz format?
<wleslie>	if it could figure that out automatically it would.
<_mb>	wleslie: hm, ok, let me try that
<_mb>	thanks
<deadsix27>	seylerius: i have unaware time and a timezone as string as described above, and i try to apply that timezone to the unaware time
<seylerius>	ah, lemme take a look at a different thing i'd used recently. that actually does some of that.
<deadsix27>	seylerius: note, the unaware time, is actually in that timezone, but i have to make python know that it is, by the method i described above
<_mb>	wleslie: https://bpaste.net/show/0546572a907e ok seems good enough
<seylerius>	deadsix27: look at dateutil.parser
<wleslie>	cool
<seylerius>	i've used that to beat timestrings into shape before.
<deadsix27>	seylerius: meaning, it should not get converted into that timezone just yet, but later into any i want. (e.g i have time 12.12.12 22:00 as "unaware" and i have gmt-5 as string, apply that, and convert all together to utc)
<seylerius>	deadsix27: do they come as "12.12.12 22:00, gmt-5", and you split them?
<deadsix27>	no
<deadsix27>	the come out is even more confuse, it comes out as bare time and weekday
<deadsix27>	i calculate the next date that weekday + time appears from now
<deadsix27>	as*
<deadsix27>	then i get the 12.12.12 22:00, without a timezone
<seylerius>	wow.
<deadsix27>	its for a deadline duration thing
<seylerius>	this (https://dateutil.readthedocs.org/en/latest/parser.html) might be able to help, but that's a hell of a thing.
<deadsix27>	ill look into it
<deadsix27>	seylerius: i thought about just parsing the gmt string manually, and printing it out as f ull time string, i guess that could work
<deadsix27>	but im unaware of all the timezones it could possibly have, e.g im unsure if it ever goes to cest or always stays gmt-/+xx
<spaceone>	hi
<spaceone>	if you look at https://bpaste.net/show/8f579f08e907 it shows that subprocess.popen object will have a wrong returncode
<spaceone>	why is this? / how to fix it
<jim>	spaceone, what return value? the output of popen()?
<spaceone>	jim: the correct returncode
<spaceone>	not some output
<spaceone>	i want the indication that it segfaultet
<jim>	do you have source for segfault?
<hydraidm801>	any vim users here?
<titou>	here
<hydraidm801>	how do you manage indenation?
<hydraidm801>	i can't get vim to show me the difference between spaces and tabs
<titou>	at the end of each file i set:
<titou>	# vim: set expandtab tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 smarttab tw=80 si fenc=utf8 :
<titou>	tabs characters are replaced by 4 spaces
<hydraidm801>	nice i'll add that to my vimrc
<titou>	(you can change if you want)
<titou>	it's better to set that in each file of your project
<titou>	since any other vim users will see your file like you
<titou>	and i'm not sure you always want tab characters be replaced by spaces..
<titou>	(for instance if you write makefile it will be problematic :)
<hydraidm801>	true
<jim>	you'd probably only want to do that for indentation
<hydraidm801>	looks like i already had those in my vimrc
<titou>	si stands for smartindent ;)
<titou>	it's the best i found for python code
<titou>	smarttab is also a nice thing :)
<hydraidm801>	:set smarttab ??
<titou>	yup
<leetpeet>	hi sorry to bother, is learnpythonthehardway the best tutorial for learning, i've never programmed in my life or well scripted.
<hydraidm801>	python.org reccomends syntax on, filetype indent plugin on
<asdf`>	leetpeet, it is what we usually recommend to new programmers, yes
<leetpeet>	any other complimenting tutorials ?
<titou>	hydraidm801: for sure but i hope it's already enabled in your vimrc :)
<leetpeet>	i dont have any foundation and my math is terrible :(
<hydraidm801>	titou: it wasn't
<asdf`>	leetpeet, the tutorial on docs.python.org/tutorial (but only after you read lpthw)
<hydraidm801>	i am trying to ditch ide's and only use vim
<asdf`>	leetpeet, math isn't required
<jim>	leetpeet, then you'd only have problems with math-oriented programs
<jim>	not all programs are
<titou>	hydraidm801: for that purpose you'll find lots of website which gives you some hints about nice plugins :)
<jim>	what do you want to do with python right now/first?
<hydraidm801>	i just spent 10 minutes trying to fix an indentation error in vim and i failed and had to open the file in an ide to see where tabs and spaces got mixed up
<asdf`>	leetpeet, let's keep it in the channel please; you can use this channel for questions, and #python-offtopic for general chat
<jim>	what is more needed for writing computer programs
<jim>	is
<titou>	for instance: matchit, minibufexpl, nerd_commenter, project, taglist, vtreeexplorer, sparkup, omni :)
<jim>	writing
<jim>	so, things like english composition would help you much more than math
<hydraidm801>	titou: i don't ahve any of those!! i'll check into them all thanks
<leetpeet>	are there any simple projects that i can practise with ?
<jim>	sure
<leetpeet>	i learn better with repetition i guess understanding the code
<leetpeet>	<-- slow learner
<titou>	hydraidm801: you're welcome
<jim>	learn to write.... since writing computer programs is writing
<hydraidm801>	titou: i just have vundle and nerdtree for now.
<monkeyget>	that's very true
<yeryry>	and lpthw is very slow, so you shouldn't have any problems with that...
<jim>	monkeyget, that quote is due to alan i holub
<cast>	i presume its a bad omen if i'm considering using sys.getrefcount() in my algo :o
<wooble>	almost certainly yes.
<nedbat>	hydraidm801: you also want to use :set list    sometimes.
<hydraidm801>	nedbat: okay i will read up on that thanks!
<nedbat>	cast: interesting! what drew you to getrefcount?
<n00bster>	hey, i need to "substract" two dictionaries in python, like i have a dictionary one with some keys, dictionary two with keys which i want to delete from one
<cast>	nedbat: having just enough knowledge to be dangerous [i'm 1/3rd through learning python 5th ed], and being prone to convoluted lines of thought
<n00bster>	values are not important, three should contain only keys from one which aren't deleted ;)
<ronny>	n00bster: so you want to prune all items that fit a certain key?
<nedbat>	cast: ok, but what was it? i'm just curious, i won't berate you... :)
<n00bster>	ronny: yeah
<nedbat>	n00bster: subdict = { k:v for k,v in dict1.iteritems() if k not in dict2 }
<ronny>	n00bster: three = {k: v for k, v in one.items() if k not in two} ?
<nedbat>	ronny: nice! :)
<n00bster>	thx!
<jim>	a dict comprehension?
<ronny>	jim: yes
<ronny>	nedbat: , thx, yours too :)
<rahulan>	hii all
<monkeyget>	am i dense or is project packaging/structure/deployment a mess in python?
<jmakov>	monkeyget: virtualenv
<monkeyget>	you have to juggle with distutils, setuptools, pip, virtualenv, virtualenvwrapper, requirements.txt, setup.py, __init__.py, doc generation, various testing frameworks,...
<jmakov>	monkeyget: virtualenv + requirenments.txt. that's it
<bullicon>	monkeyget: they are a plethora of tools, choose what suits you
<ronny>	monkeyget: its a bit of a mess, things are only slowly getting better
<bullicon>	setuptools are for packaging, a different way of deployment
<monkeyget>	packaging is the thing that bothers me the most
<nedbat>	monkeyget: it's not great, but it's not as big a disaster as it seems.
<nedbat>	monkeyget: it's a tough problem that developers don't want to think about, so when you get into the details, it seems more complicated than it should be
<monkeyget>	what with the .egg stuff
<ronny>	monkeyget: current manra for packaging is, use setuptools
<ionelmc>	monkeyget: everything that you don't know looks like a mess? have you looked at https://packaging.python.org/ ?
<ronny>	monkeyget: and avoid eggs, the format is being killed
<sampath>	rahulan: hii
<the-compiler>	i found everything very confusing until i found https://packaging.python.org/
<jim>	ionelmc, that sounds a bit accusatory :)
<the-compiler>	there are way too many outdated tutorials
<n00bster>	and how can i create a dictionary (with empty values) from a string? like i have string = "alpha,beta,gamma,delta" and i want a dict = {'alpha': '', 'beta': '', 'gamma': '', 'delta': ''}
<ronny>	n00bster: check out the dict.fromkeys classmethod
<sampath>	https://bpaste.net/show/566d974b1fd2
<n00bster>	ronny: thank you, sir!
<the-compiler>	n00bster: {key: '' for key in yourstring.split(',')}   (untested)
<sampath>	what am i doing wrong in the code https://bpaste.net/show/566d974b1fd2
<ionelmc>	jim: heh, well yeah, it's just that when you do something a lot you become less understanding of ramp-up issues, cause you don't hit those issues anymore
<monkeyget>	what's a good project i can look at which does all the packaging/testing/ci/... stuff?
<ionelmc>	uh oh :)
<aclark>	ronny: i would not sound the egg death knell just yet, but it's fair to say there are competing formats :-)
<monkeyget>	preferably something simple, like a library that can be imported by other projects
<n00bster>	the-compiler: you're the best, thanks!
<willisman>	monkeyget: pint?
<ionelmc>	monkeyget: everyone has their own "right way" to do packaging/testing/whatever
<aclark>	certainly egg is a legacy format
<jim>	ionelmc, true... and, is it surprising that some get stuck on such rampup stuff
<sampath>	i would like to run a set of executable files one after another
<rahulan>	sampath, hii
<sampath>	rahulan: hi rahul ..i would like to run a set of executable files one after another
<the-compiler>	monkeyget: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/jinja2 for example
<asdf`>	sampath, sure, use the subprocess module
<ronny>	aclark: the egg death is actively being worked on, unlike wheel, egg is not a official format, and egg is broken in various ways
<rahulan>	well i guess, you should paste the contents of c:/program files (x86)/microsoft directx sdk (june 2010)/samples/c++/direct3d11/bin/x64/  dir.
<aclark>	and some folks would probably like them to go away…
<rahulan>	what error you are getting
<aclark>	ronny: who is working on "egg death"? i've not seen this
<monkeyget>	https://packaging.python.org/ is great! thanks for the link
<rahulan>	paste the error..
<rahulan>	sampath, ^
<sampath>	i dont see any error here https://bpaste.net/show/566d974b1fd2
<ronny>	aclark: me for example, next step is teaching setuptools to tread wheels as zip-unsafe eggs
<aclark>	ronny: o_o
<rahulan>	sampath, thats same paste.
<rahulan>	sampath, what are you expecting ?
<petazz>	how could i debug why my __init__ is not called when inheriting from 3 classes?
<ronny>	aclark: setuptools has a lot of places where implicit easy_install happens, im working on enabling opt-out fom thand as well as using unziped wheels instead of eggs
<sampath>	i am expecting to run multiple executable files one after another using subprocess
<sampath>	rahulan:
<rahulan>	sampath, then? are they running?
<aclark>	ronny: ah, cool
<sampath>	rahulan: no that is the problem i am facing
<jim>	petazz, are your derived classes calling the base-class __init__()?
<rahulan>	sampath, it is not giving you any error then ? are they even starting?
<ronny>	aclark: after those steps are finished, the wheel format will more easily be able to superseed eggs
<sampath>	rahulan: it runs all the files in the list within a minute on a command prompt without showing any ui
<petazz>	jim: yes
<petazz>	the inheritance is that there are two classes that inherit from each other and one extra that does not inherit anything
<jim>	could you take one of the derived classes, and in the init, show the call?
<petazz>	i'd need to make sure all __init__s get called
<aclark>	ronny: right
<jim>	it should be one line (well probably)
<petazz>	jim: http://pastebin.com/qeh1z8uq
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/8ge3rwecnjwlbk4l4rud/ (repasted for petazz)
<petazz>	using ipdb to debug
<cast>	nedbat: well, it turned out my line of thinking wasn't going to solve my problem so not worth explaining too much :). i was going to create an arrangement of data structures such that most objects would only show up once within them and objects that did show up multiple times would be the ones of interest
<jim>	ok, in the base class could you put a print
<petazz>	jim: a print?
<jim>	yeah, so that when you test the derived classes, you'd see that print happen
<nedbat>	petazz: you're using super correctly.  make sure all your base classes also call super
<qwerty1793>	hi, i have a test which looks like: [f(i) for l in x for i in l] == [g(i) for l in y for i in l]. is there a nice way of rewriting this using an any / zip? (here x and y are lists of lists of integers)
<nedbat>	petazz: also, you might want those base classes in the other order: they should be listed in more-specific to more-general order.
<petazz>	hmm ok it seems like the "document"-class does not have __init__ at all defined
<petazz>	ok maybe i'd try that..
<ronny>	qwerty1793: something like all(f(i) == g(i) for l in x for i in l) ?
<petazz>	i'd rather not do prints, ipdb works a lot better with that especially while running tests
<jim>	petazz, ok, so add the __init__ to the document class then see
<petazz>	jim: it's an external library :/ namely mongoengine
<aclark>	monkeyget: anyway, #pypa for more packaging chat if you like :-)
<qwerty1793>	ronny, but one of them is iterating over x and one is going over y so i need some clever zip or something
<jim>	petazz, consider the print thing in your bag of tools... it would be just in there temporarily
<n00bster>	how can i convert string dictionary to unicode one? like from {'alpha': 'test', 'beta': 'nest'} to {u'alpha': u'test', u'beta': u'nest'} ?
<jim>	of course, some programs dont have a terminal to see the print
<ronny>	qwerty1793: oh, i missed that
<rahulan>	sampath, does it working?
<jim>	however... it
<xqo>	is javascript faster than python?
<jim>	is interesting to see that the one class had the missing __init__, you may have to look at the other classes to make sure they have __init__s
<isarl>	hello, everyone! i was surprised by the behaviour of the # -*- coding: rot_13 -*- magic today and was wondering if anybody could help me grok it. i have a couple bpastes here...
<isarl>	first of all, working code: https://bpaste.net/show/f2c7004dfe9e
<jmakov>	xqo: http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/
<isarl>	maybe s/python/python2
<|zz|>	qwerty1793: all(f(i[0])==g(i[1]) for x in zip(x,y) for i in zip(*x))
<isarl>	so what surprised me is when, in vim, i did an s/utf-8/rot_13/, then moved to the first line after the comments and did a g?g (or for non-vimmers, rot-13 encode the whole file). shown here: https://bpaste.net/show/e8631b76d2e8
<|zz|>	qwerty1793: but i don't see any advantage of this solution over yours (except if obfuscation is a plus)
<isarl>	i would expect to see "hello world!" printed, but it just exits, no error code, no stack traces
<yeryry>	add some prints to the function showing d.month etc?
<the-compiler>	isarl: hm, odd
<wooble>	is this a good time to repeat the mantra "#python is for good ideas"? :)
<asdf`>	isarl, #coding doesn't affect bytestring literals, your '__main__' is still main
<qwerty1793>	|zz|, that's a good suggestion. i think it is better because it doesn't require the entire list to be generated
<asdf`>	isarl, (it does however affect unicode literals)
<jim>	that mantra destroys creativity and curiousity, and i therefore do not approve of it
<wooble>	today i learned: emacs really doesn't want me to save a file with rot-13 coding. :)
<the-compiler>	why doesn't this work in python3 though? now i have to use python2 to write my rot13-ed code! ;)
<wooble>	what happens in python 3?
<the-compiler>	syntaxerror: encoding problem: rot_13
<the-compiler>	(there's no rot13 encoding)
<isarl>	asdf`: ok interesting
<isarl>	so if i do u"__main__" instead, it should work?
<wooble>	oh, right, because python 3 separates out the bytes-to-bytes ones?
<isarl>	is __name__ a unicode?
<asdf`>	isarl, no, because __name__ is bytes
<isarl>	haha
<isarl>	clever, no way around it :)
<isarl>	or maybe i'm not clever enough?
<wooble>	__name__ guard here is kind of silly anyway. do you really need to import from this? :)
<isarl>	i mean i suppose i could somehow obfuscate shoving together the "__main__" bytes, and then compare against a non-byte literal
<isarl>	haha no :d
<isarl>	but modules are fun!
<isarl>	namespaces are one honking great idea
<isarl>	thanks everybody :)
<the-compiler>	isarl: you can compare bytes with unicode
<isarl>	i need to go read a lot more about unicode apparently
<isarl>	>>> "__main__" == u"__main__" # true
<jim>	isn';t that because ascii is a subset of unicode?
<ronny>	isarl: python2 or python3?
<isarl>	ronny: python3 apparently chokes on the rot_13 bit, definitely python2
<the-compiler>	isarl: do you mean  __anzr__ == h"__znva__"  ? :p
<|zz|>	isarl: this works http://ix.io/ibh
<isarl>	the-compiler:  yes, exactly – in fact i just did an incomplete switch, leaving out the h in front of "ebg13", and now python at least gave me a lookuperror :)
<ronny>	isarl: python3 no longer hasa rot13 encoding, and python2 has various places where it converts between byte strings and unicode
<the-compiler>	isarl: i first put an u there and spent like a minute wondering why i'd get a syntaxerror
<the-compiler>	s/y/y/
<isarl>	also, "put it in h!" http://i.imgur.com/4cdgjcv.gifv
<isarl>	|zz|: thanks, i got there too once i figured out the "__main__"==u"__main__" thing :)
<pcatinean>	if i have a dict with 3 values inside and a second with the same 3 + 2 more, how do i get those 2 more?
<pcatinean>	dict comprehension?
<nedbat>	pcatinean: what do you mean by "get them"?
<pcatinean>	variant_vals = {key: val for key, val in vals if key not in tmpl_fields}
<pcatinean>	this the only way or is there a better way or a method that does the "difference"
<pcatinean>	?
<|zz|>	pcatinean: make them sets and compute the difference. you get the keys
<nedbat>	pcatinean: your dict comp is almost right: variant_vals = { k:v for k,v in vals.iteritems() if k not in tmpl_fields }
<pcatinean>	ah forgot the iteritems and to make it a bit more tight
<pcatinean>	thanks nedbat ! :d
<yhg1s>	jim: no, they're completely different things (bytes versus text.) see bit.ly/unipain for the difference and for why the comparison works in python 2.
<isarl>	wooble: what happened when you tried saving in rot13 with emacs? haha
<agent86>	when using tkinter.grid_forget() is it possible to reuse .grid(row = 3, column =2) for another label while the first label is removed with grid_forget() ?
<agent86>	or does this create a conflict loop of some sort
<agent86>	as i understand grid_forget() is really not forgotten but just not displayed so i wondered what happens to the row,column space if i put something else there when the first label is not being displayed
<agent86>	is this ok or not recommended ?
<danjou>	when i do log.exception(...) it doesn't raise an exception, right?
<medwards>	danjou: no
<danjou>	i'll tias
<danjou>	medwards: no, i'm not right or no, it doesn't?
<medwards>	danjou: it doesn't raise an exception... i mean, not unless you do something in (...) that causes its own exception
<jkbbwr>	why is it, if i do id(object()) it just alternates between two numbers
<danjou>	medwards: k, thanks
<jkbbwr>	each time that is
<danjou>	literally object?
<latk>	i'm using anaconda, and wondered what is the correct way to add local projects to the python path? e.g. i have some project at ~/myproject, which i would like to be able to use from ipython/other scripts. how should i do this ?
<wooble>	jkbbwr: the id can be reused because the object is garbage collected.
<yhg1s>	jkbbwr: because the same bit of memory is re-used.
<asdf`>	wooble, yhg1s, that would explain using always the same number (which is what happens for me), not alternating between two numbers
<wooble>	asdf`: i'm seeing the same number repeatedly, myself.
<nedbat>	jkbbwr: show us
<yhg1s>	asdf`: nope, it depends on what's getting cached where.
<asdf`>	yhg1s, where can things be cached?
<yhg1s>	asdf`: in the implementation.
<asdf`>	indeed
<yhg1s>	(python uses freelists for some objects, but a custom allocator that may or may not be re-using the same bit of memory for objects of the same size)
<yhg1s>	i don't believe there's a freelist for 'object' instances, since they're not particularly common, so you just get whatever the object allocator felt like giving you.
<wooble>	i'm seeing the same number over and over in both 2.7 and 3.4 on os x and windows. in ipython, i get a different number the second time, but then that number repeats.
<wooble>	(in pypy you get a new number every time)
<swenzel>	the-compiler: remember my question yesterday about the assertion message checker? turns out there is no 'msg' attribute on the assert node. its called 'fail' is this an error in the docs?
<revolve>	anyone able to help with packaging data directories using setuptools?
<revolve>	(static web assets in this case)
<swenzel>	the-compiler: nvm... i guess it's just asteroid using a different name than python's ast
<jackneill>	hey
<jackneill>	how to make an md5 hash of a large file while not eating up the ram?
<yhg1s>	jackneill: read it in chunks, feed it to a hashlib.md5 instance.
<jackneill>	yhg1s: yes but if i do hash.update(chunk) and thne again repeatedly, as the doc says : m.update(a); m.update(b) is equivalent to m.update(a+b). so wont the hash object in the end contain the whole file?
<yhg1s>	jackneill: no, it doesn't contain any of the data. it just contains the hash.
<jackneill>	yhg1s: thanks
<frege>	hey guys
<elfrederich>	how should i organize a module that has a single file?  i want to use a setup.py to be able to install it.  i should have setup.py in the root directory, but should i have foo.py also at the root, or should i have a foo directory with the content in __init__.py?
<elfrederich>	... or have a src directory, etc?
<frege>	i'm making a package and i want to include all the dependencies in that package so when i try to install it on another machine it won't need to grab it from the internet
<yhg1s>	elfrederich: the former.
<yhg1s>	elfrederich: although if you have tests (and you should have tests) you should have a package and not a single .py file.
<yhg1s>	elfrederich: see bit.ly/pypackages
<elfrederich>	yhg1s, so at root directory i have a setup.py, foo directory and tests directory.  inside of foo i have a single __init__.py
<yhg1s>	elfrederich: no, the tests go inside the package.
<frege>	how could i tell setup.py where the source code of required packages are?
<yhg1s>	frege: setup.py doesn't really have support for that.
<frege>	yhg1s: how should i do that then?
<frege>	i can't believe that i don't have that option
<ionelmc>	frege: setuptools.find_packages
<yhg1s>	frege: i dont' recommend doing it at all, but you can do some of what youw ant with virtualenvs, or with binary packages, or with installers.
<frege>	what if someone wants to install a package with dependencies offline?
<yhg1s>	frege: then they install the dependencies. i'm not sure what problem you're forseeing.
<frege>	ya i'm experimenting with virtualenv
<supay>	im not sure how to use the imgurpython api.. this code apparently has some errors..
<supay>	https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/icsvqtmf
<frege>	yhg1s: i want to move the virtualenv to another machine from osx to linux, so the binaries won't work. how could i make it reinstall all sources in virtualenv?
<yhg1s>	frege: 'pip freeze' and 'pip install'. you can tell pip to use a separate server for the packages, or provide a cache directory.
<supay>	specifically - nameerror: name 'upload_from_path' is not defined
<yhg1s>	frege: or you can just check out all the sources and run 'pip install' on each of them.
<frege>	yhg1s: providing a cache directory sournds great
<yhg1s>	supay: and where is 'upload_from_path' supposed to come from? did you perhaps mean to import it from imgurpython, or use client.upload_from_path?
<supay>	yhg1s: im not sure actually. its a function of imgurclient which i've already imported, i guess.. https://github.com/imgur/imgurpython
<yhg1s>	supay: if it's a method of the imgurclient class, you need to use client.upload_from_path, yes.
<supay>	yhg1s: oh, i see.. giving it a shot. how silly of me :)
<supay>	yhg1s: i've done that, now it doesn't cause an error.. but i don't think its uploading either.
<inad922>	how can i force pip to reinstall packages from a given source no matter what
<inad922>	--upgrade --force-reinstall doesn't seem to work
<aclark>	inad922: "doesn't seem to work" ? how about uninstall first
<jackneill>	what is the most efficient way of check if a path is dir?
<bixel>	os.path.isdir
<mrelendig>	depends on how you want to deal with symlinks etc
<papna>	jackneill: oftentimes the least error-prone thing to do is to use it and catch the exception.
<jackneill>	i want to ignore the symlinks
<bixel>	note that isdir works with simlinks.  if you want to check for both simlink and isdir:  os.path.islink
<jackneill>	papna: to use what? os.path.isdir?
<yhg1s>	jackneill: use the directory.
<papna>	jackneill: to use the path however you're going to use it
<papna>	jackneill: for example, to use the directory as a directory
<jackneill>	i see, thanks
<inad922>	aclark: yeah, but shouldn't the -i flag do the same
<phale>	hey guys just wanted to say farewell to the #python community
<bixel>	@jackneill i agree with papna... a try / except probably has the least amount of code.  to be very error tolerant, you would need to test the path to see if it's a string, if it's filled in, if the path exists, if it is a dir and if it is not a link
<yhg1s>	bixel: or no try/except at all.
<phale>	mrelendig: why?
<mrelendig>	bring out your dead! bring out your dead!
<yhg1s>	phale: it's a monty python reference.
<phale>	c is the third letter in the english alphabet, and a letter of the alphabets of many other writing systems, which inherited it from the latin alphabet.
<phale>	a reference to the wikipedia article about the letter c
<wavi>	hello
<aclark>	inad922: seems like it
<jkbbwr>	sorry i think i missed the answer, im sitting in the repl, and did id(object()) twice, i get two different id's but if i run it a third time i get one of the previous two id's
<yhg1s>	jkbbwr: okay, and what is your question?
<jkbbwr>	yhg1s: if i do invalid = object() at the top of a module, will it be unique?
<yhg1s>	jkbbwr: both the object and its id will be unique for the lifetime of the object, yes.
<jkbbwr>	so is the fact i did id(object()) id(object()) id(object()) just happen to recycle the first id, giving it to the 3rd?
<schlitzer>	hey, how can i unittest if something is a instance of threading.lock? self.assertisinstance(clustermap._lock, threading.lock) is not working
<yhg1s>	jkbbwr: pretty much.
<jkbbwr>	yhg1s: i see
<schlitzer>	ahh, and i am using python 3.4
<yhg1s>	schlitzer: there is no good way to test that.
<yhg1s>	schlitzer: what would it be if not a lock?
<schlitzer>	yhg1s, that is the point, it could be something else, but should be a instance of threading.lock
<yhg1s>	schlitzer: what else could it be? what would make it something else?
<schlitzer>	i do not know what else it could be, i just want to make sure that is is, what i suggest it should be. i have a class, where i like to be sure that it is initialized with all the attributes it should have
<schlitzer>	so the test fails, if someone accidentally removes a line or something like this
<andre_pl>	i'm having timezone trouble, can anyone explain the strange 5:18 offset here? http://pastebin.com/8r4gdx7s why sin't it an even # of hours?
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/hxtjoein9ogxascxrglz/ (repasted for andre_pl)
<apteryx>	hello :) i'm trying to parse the following date string: "2015-04-27t14:49:39-04:00" using datetime, but for the last utc offset part (-04:00), i'm left wondering how to parse it.
<apteryx>	up to now, i tried: datetime.strptime(date_str, '%y-%m-%dt%h:%m:%s%z')
<apteryx>	the problem is the last %z, it would recognized the following: -0400 but not -04:00. should i just alterate the date_str ?
<apteryx>	*it would recognize
<min3r>	does anyone know if the python module otpauth is compatible with the standard google auth ?
<min3r>	i have the python otpauth module working, generating codes and verifying codes.  however, i cant get those codes/keys working with linux pam otp module. (which i have tested and works with freeradius)
<nedbat>	schlitzer: it sounds like you are testing internal details of the class, which may not be what you want.  test the public interface of the class
<schlitzer>	nedbat, yes, this is correct, i am testing internals, for example if arguments passed, to the class while creation, are saved to the corresponding attribute
<nedbat>	schlitzer: do you understand what i mean about only testing the public interface?
<schlitzer>	for example __init__ accepts a parameter called "lock" which defaults to threading.lock, bute could be replaced with another threading implementation.
<nedbat>	schlitzer: in some ways, what do you care whether the attributes have the right values?  as long as the class behaves correctly, what's the difference?
<schlitzer>	nedbat, so i should only test the methods if they are doing what they are supposed to do?
<nedbat>	schlitzer: ideally, yes.
<nedbat>	schlitzer: it might be difficult to assess that, but that is the ideal
<nedbat>	schlitzer: about your lock parameter, how would a unittest determine that the caller had passed the right kind of thing anyway?  that's caller code, not class code.
<schlitzer>	nedbat, yes i guess you are right, i think i tried to over engineer this
<dammitjim>	i'm trying to do listdir(path) in windows
<schlitzer>	will try to keep it simpler
<dammitjim>	is there something special i need to use to escape something like c:\laptop\test ?
<dammitjim>	the \ characters?
<nedbat>	dammitjim: r"c:\laptop"
<dammitjim>	nedbat, listdir(r"c:\laptop\test") ?
<marethyu>	hi. is it possible, on a gnu/linux system with x11, to display a picture in python without any window ?
<nedbat>	dammitjim: yes, does it work?
<dammitjim>	no, it's not returning anything for: [f for f in os.listdir(r"d:\laptop\temp") if path.isfile(f)]
<marethyu>	 is it possible, on a gnu/linux system with x11, to display a picture in python without any window, please ?
<dammitjim>	when i add a \ after temp, i get a syntaxerror: eol while scanninng string literal
<jim>	dammit...
<dammitjim>	...jim!
<yonatan>	dammitjim: add \\
<yonatan>	dammitjim: you're getting lucky that the other backslashes work. you should always write \\ whenever you mean the literal character "\"
<dammitjim>	yonatan, i did
<dammitjim>	that was my original question
<srpx>	hello, why won't this python program run? http://lpaste.net/131685 it crashes and displays a system error. :( can i run it?
<srpx>	somehow? maybe compiling?
<dammitjim>	i can list the directory contents with os.listdir
<srpx>	(notice that the same program runs for lower input sizes.)
<dammitjim>	but when the test is performed with if path.isfile(f), it doesn't print anything
<nedbat>	dammitjim: if you print out what listdir returns, you'll see it's only the local names.
<nedbat>	dammitjim: "foo.txt", not "d:\laptop\temp\foo.txt"
<dammitjim>	only the local names... ok
<nedbat>	dammitjim: you need to do os.path.join(r"d:\...", f)
<dammitjim>	i just want to count how many fiiles are on a folder
<jim>	srpx, it's in haskell?
<srpx>	that's python...
<nedbat>	srpx: you can't just up the recursion limit arbitrarily.  there's a reason there's a limit
<dammitjim>	nedbat, where do i need to do that?
<autrilla_>	what's the most popular gui framework?
<srpx>	:( okay
<srpx>	so no?
<nedbat>	dammitjim: wherever you want to get the actual full path to the file
<nedbat>	srpx: i can't figure out what this code is meant to do, but it sure seems like you can't do it this way
<nedbat>	srpx: why would you write it this way?
<srpx>	compiling from another language...
<srpx>	needed to interact with python code.
<nedbat>	srpx: what language?
<srpx>	lambda calculus
<nedbat>	srpx: that's not a language, it's math.
<srpx>	yep it is
<dammitjim>	again, all i want is to count how many files are on a folder
<srpx>	and it is awesome :)
<nedbat>	srpx: if you compiled it by hand, then just re-write it.
<srpx>	no i wrote a compiler
<srpx>	well guess i'll have to risk python from the list of languages i can inject my lc code in easily... :(
<nedbat>	srpx: or write a smarter compiler
<nedbat>	srpx: what you have here isn't so much a compiler as a transliteration
<yhg1s>	srpx: there'll be quite a few languages that will run into recursion limits if you don't make your compiler emit iterative code instead.
<srpx>	there's not much that can be done to improve it actually... if i'm not using native functions then i'm better just compiling it to scheme, then c, then calling c from python (or something like that)
<dammitjim>	nedbat, i think i kinda understand what you meant
<srpx>	(writing a good compiler for functional languages isn't trivial)
<srpx>	thanks though :)
<dammitjim>	what is the official document to configure python on a windows server 2012 r2? i already installed python, but the paths are not configured
<schwarzbaer>	hi. i'm trying to experiment with a oauth2-using api in an ipython notebook. what'd be the easiest way to start an http server for the callback?
<yhg1s>	dammitjim: recent python installers will ask if you want to add it to the registry and to the path environment variable. or, you can use py.exe instead.
<dammitjim>	where do i get py.exe?
<snappy>	how can i raise timeouterror, its an exception under oserror, but i don't know how to import it
<snappy>	ah it was added in python 3.3, i see.
<yhg1s>	dammitjim: https://bitbucket.org/vinay.sajip/pylauncher
<quinor>	hey, i'm looking for some information about sending email from python
<stain>	it is easy!
<yhg1s>	dammitjim: oh, i guess https://bitbucket.org/pypa/pylauncher is now the canonical location.
<stain>	quinor: here is how i do it: https://github.com/stain/mailer
<dammitjim>	thanks
<dammitjim>	i got it... it was an option "package" in the installer i guess i missed
<papna>	schwarzbaer: i think what you probably want to do is receive the callback url redirect but not follow it, instead just pulling what you want out of it directly.
<stain>	quinor: even gmail compatible (if you send not too many)
<papna>	schwarzbaer: you're automating the login?
<papna>	schwarzbaer: or do you want the user actually to do it in a browser?
<quinor>	stain: thanks :)
<stain>	quinor: be good... :_)
<schwarzbaer>	in a browser.
<quinor>	stain: it clears lots of things, do t
<quinor>	stain: do you maybye know where can i get more information about headers, how should i set them etc.?
<papna>	schwarzbaer: there are many http servers for python.
<papna>	schwarzbaer: the one in the stdlib is pretty bad, but might be okay for your usecase, where you could want a short-lived server
<papna>	schwarzbaer: the module it's in is called basehttpserver in 2 and http.server in 3
<schwarzbaer>	thanks.
<quinor>	stain: or keywords to look for
<tsui>	hi all , i'm new to python , i want to know ,how to post json data to a server using python and with customized header
<papna>	tsui: the requests module can probably make your task relatively straightforward
<tsui>	eg, my data is : [ {"height":180,"weight":70}, {"height":170,"weight":60} ]
<eviljames>	tsui: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/
<papna>	tsui: you must be in decent shape.
<tsui>	papna, yes, but when i use urlencode(), it throw errors
<papna>	tsui: don't call urlencode directly, and if that's the json data don't call it on that at all
<papna>	tsui: are you using requests?
<tsui>	i'm using urllib2
<papna>	tsui: if you want specific help, pastebin a sscce http://sscce.org/
<papna>	tsui: using requests is much easier and more robust and powerful
<papna>	tsui: nonetheless, you can probably get help to do it using urllib2, but we must be very, very concrete if we're to get specific. :)
<tsui>	oh, i see
<tsui>	i searched "post json using python" and many ppl recommend urllib
<yhg1s>	tsui: such is the internet.
<yhg1s>	tsui: use requests instead.
<tsui>	ok, thanks , i give it a try
<redzaku>	+1 for requests
<tsui>	:)
<jackcom>	i want study about parameter that is function. but i can’t find it. who can tell me link?
<jackcom>	i want study about parameter that is given as function. but i can’t find it. who can tell me link?
<barneygale>	jackcom, your question is unclear, can your rephrase? check /topic for a python channel in your language.
<barneygale>	jackcom, what is the function?
<jackcom>	yes. barneygale. function want parameter as variable, but there is function want parameter as function.
<jackcom>	function(function)
<barneygale>	jackcom, functions are first-class objects in python. you can pass them around like you would a string or an integer.
<jackcom>	yes barneygale i want study about it. i want document related with it.
<yhg1s>	jackcom: there is no document, as such.
<jackcom>	yes :)
<jackcom>	yhg1s:
<barneygale>	jackcom, http://www.diveintopython.net/getting_to_know_python/everything_is_an_object.html
<schwarzbaer>	jackcom, it really is too simple for documentation: http://paste2.org/wmdbpc7x
<jackcom>	nice schwarzbaer thank for giving it to me. :)
<bosnjak>	hi all
<schwarzbaer>	abstaining from all obvious innuendo and double entendre, i now say goodbye. ^^
<barneygale>	ahahaha
<bosnjak>	does pyodbc require freetds to be installed on the system? seem that pymssql requires this
<mr0x58>	hi guys
<mr0x58>	how do i get the expected result? https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/txdzanih/splitting+issue
<willisman>	mr0x58: use .extend not .append
<willisman>	mr0x58: you can also use "columnparams += item.split(':')"
<mr0x58>	it should be something simple, yet im stuck with it
<mr0x58>	oh, the +=, people didnt like it yesterday
<ippatsuman>	hello folk. i am defining a decorator within a class, that has accesso to instance variables. everything works, except for the fact that subclasses can not use the decorator. how can i fix it? minimal runnable code here: http://ideone.com/rl1afy
<mr0x58>	thanks willisman ill try extend
<yhg1s>	ippatsuman: move the decorator out of the class.
<tsui>	wow , requests is great
<tsui>	thanks all
<mr0x58>	hmm my current project im doing with urllib2, is requests so much better? and if yes: why?
<tsui>	i have a another question, python object to json , is () to [] ?
<tsui>	eg: ({"a":123},{"a":345}) will be converted to [{"a":123},{"a":345}] ?
<yhg1s>	mr0x58: it is much better, yes. it has a more useful interface, does more work for you, does ssl correctly and keeps up with all the standards at a pace that the python stdlib just can't.
<yhg1s>	tsui: yes. json doesn't have the concept of tuples, so the json module uses json arrays instead.
<tos9>	tsui: did you try it?
<ippatsuman>	yhg1s: i like it more within the class, but i guess that it's just a language limitation and it has to be defined outside, is that correct?
<tsui>	i tried tuple() and array[] , only typle works
<yhg1s>	ippatsuman: it's not so much a language limitation as how variables work, but sure. it doesn't make sense to put the decorator in the class to start with; you don't want it to become a method (it wouldn't work)
<mr0x58>	yhg1s: hmm, now im much tempted to recode my stuff in requests if ill hit more http(s) walls
<yhg1s>	mr0x58: good. you should.
<yhg1s>	tsui: 'array' is not something that exists in python, as a builtin, no. and if it did, 'array[]' wouldn't work.
<wavi>	btw, i made a console text editor with multicursor support in python. if anyone's interested: https://github.com/richrd/suplemon
<mr0x58>	i keep using names like array1, array2 because thats what they remind me of
<tsui>	i come to python from js , so i aways think "[]" define  a array, and "{}" to define a object
<yhg1s>	tsui: okay. stop thinking that. [] defines a list, {} defines a dict, and there's more syntax besides that.
<tsui>	ok, got it "[]" defines list
<papna>	it's important to expand your mind, using old concepts but also creating new ones, even sometimes only somewhat-different new ones
<tsui>	ok, thanks
<jackneill>	if a open afile on windows with this: with open( outfilepath, encoding='utf-8', mode='w' ) as outfile: and do a oufile.write('\n') will it be \r\n in the end?
<wavi>	no, it will be just \n
<forgot>	wavi: no pip support?
<wavi>	forgot: not currently, sorry :(
<wavi>	i'm planning to add it, but haven't done it before
<chriswarrick>	jackneill: try it and see™
<chriswarrick>	jackneill: outfile.write('a\nb') and see if it’s two lines in notepad
<wavi>	forgot: have you made pip packages?
<projectrevotpp>	this might seem like a weird question but whats the easiest way to convert a number in either hexadecimal or decimal to binary and return the number of bits that are 1?
<projectrevotpp>	given a series of octets
<papna>	chriswarrick: 'a\nb\n' dammit
<papna>	projectrevotpp: what do you concretely mean by 'series of octets'?
<papna>	projectrevotpp: how do you get those data?
<wooble>	jackneill: on windows, that should write \r\n
<chriswarrick>	papna: why would that matter?
<papna>	chriswarrick: because you'd write code that uses that data
<projectrevotpp>	like, given 138 (10001010), it would return 3
<chriswarrick>	papna: ?
<projectrevotpp>	its part of tpp streamer's program to read the pokedex seen flags
<papna>	projectrevotpp: ok, so you in fact get an integer, like 138?
<projectrevotpp>	which stores it as an array of octets that use the 1s as the flags for each dex #
<projectrevotpp>	so basically we need to read the number, get the octets in order, and count the 1s
<projectrevotpp>	that will return pokedex seen #
<projectrevotpp>	or whatnot
<jackneill>	wooble: i guess i need open()'s newline arg
<yeryry>	so a packed array of bools...
<projectrevotpp>	but in reality the flags use a total of somewhere between 58 and 80 bytes of data
<projectrevotpp>	so its a lot of conversions to be done
<forgot>	wavi: yes, it's easy once you convert the project src into a package
<projectrevotpp>	for both seen and owned, they have seperate flags
<wavi>	forgot: what kind of package? just a python package?
<wooble>	jackneill: yes, if you care about writing text with unix line-endings.
<wooble>	jackneill: if you going to read the file back with python, it doesn't matter, because it will read in universal newlines mode by default anyway and the file will work on any platform.
<forgot>	wavi: yes, a python package and a setup.py, then you can 'python setup.py register sdist upload' to pypi
<tos9>	don't use setup.py upload
<forgot>	what's wrong with it?
<wavi>	i gotta learn to do that asap
<tos9>	forgot: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine
<jackneill>	wooble: though i need specifically with \n newlines
<tos9>	wooble: it'd probably go in pip, not setuptools, but probably either because dstufft hasn't the time yet, or because it's missing a few features.
<papna>	jackneill: open your file with 'wb'
<chriswarrick>	tos9: speaking of which, why is easy_install still a thing?
<wooble>	papna: but then he has to manually encode. easier to specify the line ending.
<tos9>	chriswarrick: because unfortunately things still use it internally.
<projectrevotpp>	anything? returning the # of 1s in a binary string obtained from a decimal or hexadecimal value?
<forgot>	tos9: thanks, looks nice
<papna>	wooble: are we talking 3?
<projectrevotpp>	i've never heard that operation before
<wooble>	tos9: but then you need to educate everyone to use it, instead of "setup.py upload" mangically not sucking anymore. :)
<wooble>	magically*
<jackneill>	papna: well newline='\n' is the same
<jackneill>	well almost
<wooble>	papna: well, he's giving an encoding argument to open() so i hope so :)
<forgot>	perhaps setuptools should monkey patch setup.py upload
<dstufft>	wooble: setup.py "magically not sucking anymore" is a bad way to do it, because it becomes a lot harder to determine if ``setup.py upload`` is safe or not
<chriswarrick>	forgot: setuptools wouldn’t have to monkeypatch anything, they are responsible for the actual setup.py upload thing
<wooble>	also, register, because metadata 1.2 had its 10th birthday yesterday and it's still not implemented in distutils :(
<dstufft>	wooble: you don't need to call register fwiw
<forgot>	chriswarrick: ah, okay. i thought it was hooking distutils
<yeryry>	projectrevotpp: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bitarray/
<chriswarrick>	forgot: that’s possible too, but i doubt it
<chriswarrick>	forgot: ah, it looks like upload is from distutils, sorry
<forgot>	if uploading is done by setuptools itself, i cannot understand why it doesn't use tls
<chriswarrick>	forgot: it’s done by distutils, actually
<dstufft>	just use twine is a better answer :) (or once i do it, just use pip publish)
<yvear>	can someone please explain set function? http://imgur.com/56ac4wg
<zombiemanifest>	if anyone uses python in microsoft visual studio, i'm kind of new to it. how do you add line numbers? notepadd++ has it by default, just trying to figure it out. thanks in advance.
<yvear>	super confused
<_habnabit>	yvear, what is confusing you?
<nedbat>	dstufft: your logic about setup.py upload overlooks the fact that many users don't realize there is a problem.  fixing "upload" would help those people.  they won't know to use twine
<|zz|>	yvear: assume that n<256, put n in binary, it is of the form xxxxxyyy, then the result of set(n) is that the element a[xxxxxxx] changes its yyy bit to 1
<stain>	yvear: that is a bit low-level..
<stain>	it is like a bit-based set
<dstufft>	nedbat: i can just break setup.py upload ;)
<nedbat>	dstufft: true, though i don't see how that improves things :(
<yhg1s>	nedbat: it's a much better separation of concerns.
<ycyclist>	what is the name of the construct where you include a library named mylib, and then you name it below with @mylib?
<|zz|>	yvear: for example, if n=17, then in binary it is 00010111 and thus a[00010] (which is a[2]) changes the bit 7 to 1 (
<forgot>	or setuptools could just fix setup.py upload
<yhg1s>	dstufft: but yeah, at least warning people to use twine instead would be good.
<chriswarrick>	zombiemanifest: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms165340.aspx
<yhg1s>	ycyclist: '@foo' is a decorator.
<zombiemanifest>	thanks very much.
<emilsp>	hello, has anyone ever encountered runtimeerror: dictionary changed size during iteration ?
<|zz|>	yhg1s: sorry, i did it wrong, 17 in binary is 00010001
<dstufft>	nedbat: not being able ot determine if ``setup.py upload`` is safe is a pretty major problem, especially given that if you want to upload a non pure python wheel for say python 2.6 that's never going to be fixed by python itself
<ycyclist>	thank you.
<yhg1s>	emilsp: yes. it's caused exactly by what it describes.
<|zz|>	yhg1s: sorry, it was meant for yvear
<papna>	emilsp: you're iterating over a dict, but also adding or removing keys at the same time
<papna>	emilsp: so python doesn't know how to iterate over it
<nedbat>	dstufft: but if you have that question in your mind ("is setup.py upload safe?") then you already understand the issues, and will know to use twine.
<papna>	emilsp: perhaps you want to build a new dict instead?
<yvear>	|zz|, tyvm i think i get it now
<yhg1s>	(it can't know.)
<emilsp>	papna, i just realized the problem
<dstufft>	nedbat: well i wouldn't exactly say you understand it, you certainly are aware that there are some issues around it for sure though. it's not really something that i feel comfortable leaving up to "well i hope people are using an upgraded setuptools and they aren't using distutils or an old setuptools" because i know already that both of those things are true
<dstufft>	nedbat: since we're talking about _uploads_, let's say for a moment that the authors of lxml publish a wheel for python 2.6 and they don't bother to have setuptools installed, now every user of lxml is potentionally been attacked because we have no way to know if the connect between lxml's authors and pypi was safe.
<|zz|>	yvear: in your code, the size of n is not 8 bits, but 2048. anyway, the 3 lower bits are used as the position at which the bit 1 has to be set in a[m], and the 2045 upper bits to set the value of m
<nedbat>	dstufft: sure, but let's also hypothesize that they've never heard of twine.
<kucukmubasir>	hi guys, i keep getting “importerror: no module named six” , although i installed six with pip
<nedbat>	dstufft: maybe i misunderstand you.  you seem to be arguing that the best course is to leave "setup.py upload" just as it is.  i don't see how that can be the best path.
<yhg1s>	kucukmubasir: and what are you doing the import in?
<kucukmubasir>	and that command “from six import string_types “ works find in the terminal, yet in ipython browser that raises the exception
<kucukmubasir>	fine*
<|zz|>	yvear: i guess that the purpose is to store a set of 2048 booelans, in a space-effective way
<yhg1s>	kucukmubasir: then ipython browser is using a different python installation, or it was started before you installed six.
<|zz|>	(space->memory)
<kucukmubasir>	yhg1s: how may i check if ipython using a different one?
<dstufft>	nedbat: the best course is to add a new upload api that ``setup.py upload`` doesn't understand, document what an upload tool should support in terms of security checks and the like, and then remove the old api from pypi and replace it with something that just returns an error directing people to use twine (or pip publish, or whatever)
<nedbat>	dstufft: ok, good.  then i didn't understand you.
<|zz|>	yvear: another implementation, more readable but more memory consuming would be: a = [false]*2048; def set(n): a[n]=true;
<yhg1s>	dstufft: in the mean time, 'setup.py upload' could, in new versions of setuptools, *warn*.
<dstufft>	yhg1s: yes, it absolutely could and/or it could even be modified to support proper tls verification, because even though there are problems on relying on that for a proper final solution, adding it now as a stop gap isn't harmful (other than people might use it as an excuse to try and block breaking setup.py upload)
<kucukmubasir>	yhg1s: it was called from /library/python/2.7/site-packages/seaborn/axisgrid.py and yet six module is on that path as well: /library/python/2.7/site-packages/six.pyc
<wavi>	with all this talk about packaging, i'm a bit confused. is there some up-to-date guide for this?
<dstufft>	yhg1s: to be clear, i'm totally not against that, i just haven't carved out the time for doing it yet :(
<yhg1s>	dstufft: i think the separation of conerns is a good reason to leave twine as a separate tool. most users with setuptools installed never need to upload anything
<the-compiler>	wavi: http://packaging.python.org/
<dstufft>	wavi: packaging.python.org
<yvear>	|zz|, ohh ok, that's awesome! pycon is great :)
<the-compiler>	soo... i should use twine.
<yhg1s>	kucukmubasir: and did you restart the program after you installed six?
<wavi>	thanks!
<the-compiler>	i never realized twine was recommended because setup.py upload doesn't do tls
<the-compiler>	maybe at least https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/current.html should point out *why* twine is recommended (or add a more visible warning about that)?
<dstufft>	yhg1s: pip itself will problably consume twine because i think it's a better ux to have that included there
<kucukmubasir>	what program yhg1s , terminal ? yes, “ipythone notebook” command? yes
<|zz|>	how many memory does take up one boolean in cpython?
<|zz|>	are they stored as char, or as int?
<dstufft>	the-compiler: to be clear (in a way), setup.py upload sometimes does tls, and when it does tls it sometimes does verify it, but sometimes doesn't. it all depends a lot on what version of python you're using and what version of setuptools you're using (if you're using setuptools at all)
<the-compiler>	|zz|: a python bool is just a python int basically
<yvear>	the-compiler, https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing.html#upload-your-distributions
<dstufft>	the-compiler: sounds like a decent idea, open an issue on the githib repo? :)
<yhg1s>	dstufft: sure, that's fine too.
<the-compiler>	yvear: hm, fair enough
<yhg1s>	kucukmubasir: then you'll have to debug the issue. look at sys.path in the process that can't import six. look at the traceback you get when you try to import six.
<dstufft>	yhg1s: my (and others) long term goal is that setuptools more or less becomes just a build system (and it isn't "special" in that you can easily use other ones, though it'll always be special as a legacy fallback)
<the-compiler>	|zz|: print(true + true - false)   ;)
<|zz|>	yvear: according to what the-compiler said, the array of 2048 booleans would take up 8192 bytes, while the bytearray only requires 256 bytes
<the-compiler>	|zz|: sys.getsizeof(true) says 28 bytes
<|zz|>	whoa!
<yvear>	|zz|, hmm, a lot smaller
<|zz|>	the-compiler: there is some kind of memory increase due to indirection, no? because sys.getsizeof([true]*2048) gives only 8224
<yhg1s>	|zz|: no, it's just 2048 pointers to the same thing, and a bit of overhead.
<kucukmubasir>	yhg1s: while i debugging, i just pasted “import os print os.getenv('pythonpath') “ it worked, unusually :/
<|zz|>	yhg1s: ah, ok
<kucukmubasir>	then i deleted those lines, yet still working
<kucukmubasir>	thanks
<yhg1s>	kucukmubasir: sounds like something in ipython was caching things.
<kucukmubasir>	oh maybe! maybe i should have restarted the chrome :/
<|zz|>	yhg1s: so sys.getsizeof(true) -> 28 ? how can this be?
<yhg1s>	|zz|: i'm not sure what's confusing you, sorry.
<chriswarrick>	|zz|: you are counting the length of a 2048-element list, and not of 2048 “true”s
<the-compiler>	chriswarrick: size, not length
<|zz|>	yhg1s: i woud say that a boolean would require 4 bytes if stored as an int. but 28? where the other 24 came from?
<chriswarrick>	the-compiler: size, right
<chriswarrick>	|zz|: sys.getsizeof(['a']) == sys.getsizeof(['abcdef']) == 72
<|zz|>	chriswarrick: yes, i understood that. now i'm asking about the size of a single true
<the-compiler>	|zz|: a c int, sure. a python int isn't a c int.
<yhg1s>	|zz|: i'm not sure why you think it'd take 4 bytes. no python object takes less than 16 bytes, and usually much more.
<|zz|>	yhg1s: why is that? is it because it has to store its type in addition of its value?
<yhg1s>	|zz|: it's beause of how python objects are implemented, yes.
<|zz|>	ok, i got it
<yhg1s>	(it's generally not as easy as 'storing the value' either._
<yvear>	for me, sys.getsizeof(true) says 14 in py3 and 12 in py2
<jkyle>	what's the crossplatform way to create an absolute path with os.path.join? e.g. os.path.join("foo", "bar") -> foo/bar, will os.path.join("/foo", "bar") -> "/foo/bar" create the proper root path delimiter for windows?
<yhg1s>	yvear: a 32-bit build of python then.
<yvear>	ah
<yhg1s>	jkyle: if you want it relative to the current drive, just use '/', yes. paths with forward slashes actually work everywhere.
<jkyle>	ah, i can use os.path.sep
<jkyle>	os.path.join(os.path.sep, "foo", "bar")
<forgot>	os.path.join('/foo', 'bar') gets '/foo\\bar'
<forgot>	(on windows)
<yhg1s>	sure. and that works fine.

<bp-max>	hi guys, does anybone know how to crossreference a automodules function in another file in sphinx? i have an api.rst with automodule's everything. now i want to reference one specific function in another rts.
<forgot>	didn't say it's not working though
<kad-->	hey there, i am trying to retrieve elements from a string (separated with a coma) using a regular expression in order to extract them
<kad-->	string: p_url,p_cat,p_test   my pattern is: ([a-z_]+)(,[a-z_]+)*
<kad-->	unfortunately, it retrieves only the first and last element.. not the one in the middle.. any reason where i messed up?
<confluency>	kad--: why are you using a regex? just use the sting's split method.
<confluency>	kad--: if you actually needed regex (e.g. for a variable separator) you could use re.split. but it doesn't look like you do.
<kad-->	confluency: mmh, i retrieve this from a http requests, so i should extract this exact part for example
<confluency>	kad--: so you can do that with the string split method.
<kad-->	confluency: yes exactly. weird that it does not work using a regexp though. i'll switch to string.split(',')
<confluency>	it doesn't work because you're not using the right regex function.
<kad-->	confluency: i do: re.findall(pattern, string)
<pirsel>	hi o/
<forgot>	kad--: i don't think bultin re module supports repeated captures
<kad-->	forgot: yeah, i just went through this. it only retrieves the *first* and *last* element
<forgot>	kad--: regex from pypi would probably work
<forgot>	kad--: or something like pyparsing
<kad-->	forgot: thx, i will take a look at it
<confluency>	this is irrelevant, because you're trying to *split*. that's what re.split is for. anything else you use will be a weird workaround.
<confluency>	don't use findall for splitting.
<forgot>	confluency: split doesn't validate the form of items
<confluency>	1) you can do that in a separate step, and 2) is the validation even intentional, or was it only considered necessary so that findall would have something to find?
<mrcloud>	hi there
<tech2>	hi all, is anyone aware of a clear winner in terms of json rpc for python? it'd be nice if it worked with flask, but if not then i'm open to suggestions.
<sublim3__>	hi am having issues with importing hashlib in python2.7.9 all details in this post: https://bpaste.net/show/79f08e2541b1 any help apreciated
<mrcloud>	i'm very new to python and i'm trying to write a function to classify a full name intro names and surnames. i ended up with this function https://bpaste.net/show/acb495420989 i've two questions: 1. is there a practical limit in function lenghts? in java i usually have 10 lines functions. 2. is this simplificable? i think that i'm still programming as it was java...
<hiptobecubic>	mrcloud, the practical limit on function length is "one brain-full of code"
<dude-x>	mrcloud: no need to use __classify unless you have two classes that have the same method name.
<nedbat>	mrcloud: don't worry about the length of functions.  but don't use __names
<nedbat>	mrcloud: what is self.__ratios ?
<mrcloud>	dude-x: nedbat i thought that __ was to declare "private" functions
<dude-x>	forget about private and public in python
<nedbat>	mrcloud: that's a very java way to think.  there's really no point
<nedbat>	mrcloud: if you really don't want people using your methods, just use one leading underscore.
<mrcloud>	nedbat: it is a dict with name/surnames as keys and the probability to be one of them. for example, david has a value of 0.002 (its a name)
<mrcloud>	nedbat: ok, i'll change that
<dude-x>	everything is public in python. if you want to have a method that is internal to the class, use a single _ prefix so that you tell the reader of your code this is an internal method.
<dude-x>	but it's just a convention, it is not enforced by the interpreter
<hiptobecubic>	double underscore *does* pretend to enforce though, via name mangling
<hiptobecubic>	is that still a thing in py3 i haven't checked
<dude-x>	no old python 2 feature
<dude-x>	still in python 3
<mrcloud>	dude-x: yeah, i know that is not enforced, but i thought that i had to use two underscore. my fault ;)
<jim>	sublim3__, one thing i see, your apt-get upgrade did not go well... could it be you've tried to install packages meant for other versions of debian? built a system-wide python? apt-get i think uses python, so the packaged version is what you should be using
<hiptobecubic>	mrcloud, what this function really needs are some comments explaining how on earth it is supposed to work
<mrcloud>	hiptobecubic: yeah, let me fix that
<forgot>	mrcloud: what's the input fullname? is it a single fullname or a bunch of fullnames?
<nedbat>	hiptobecubic: something to keep in mind: __mangling was not meant to hide names from callers.  it was meant to prevent collisions in deep inheritance hierarchies
<mrcloud>	forgot: give me 1 minute to add some comments and i'll add the whole class. will be easier to understand
<dyce>	when is it better to make a cronjob vs a daemon?
<hiptobecubic>	nedbat, oh? i didn't know. i've never really used it. i was just disappointed to discover it.
<araujo>	dyce, when you know exactly the interval/time the process needs to be run?
<hiptobecubic>	nedbat, i never really forgave c++ for symbol mangling being so hard to sort out, i guess.
<dude-x>	cronjob - a process that runs and terminates, simpler to understand, and easy to schedule with any schedule program like cron; daemon, something should always be avaialble to respond to requests, or push out info on sub minute intervals
<bosnjak>	when using pyodbc, do i have to have the odbc driver installed, or is it bundled?
<dude-x>	bosnjak: i vagely remember that it required a compiled driver
<dude-x>	don't know the state of it today
<mrcloud>	https://bpaste.net/show/4072e5e73343 i hope this to be easier to understand
<bosnjak>	dude-x: thanks for the input
<dyce>	i am creating a script that checks a download folder, and uploads everything to google drive, then deletes, so i suppose a cronjob would suffice? with some kind of file lock
<dyce>	if the lock exists, it will wait
<dude-x>	yeah you can do that
<dude-x>	you can import flock for locking the file
<nedbat>	mrcloud: load_names and load_surnames are very similar.
<dyce>	dude-x: is that for locking a file for read/write? i was thinking creating a inuse.lock file, if exists then wait
<mrcloud>	nedbat: yep, but they use different files
<dude-x>	dyce: yes it's for locking read/write.
<sublim3__>	jim: yah i am trying to rebuild python2.7.9 from source now
<nedbat>	mrcloud: sure, but you can refactor some of that.  the code duplication is unfortunate.
<mrcloud>	nedbat: maybe a function two load a random file and store the result in each variable?
<nedbat>	mrcloud: sounds good
<mrcloud>	nedbat: i have it in two functions because in one i use a list and in the other one a dict with key, value
<jim>	sublim3__, you shouln't install it in any system-wide place (/usr, /usr/local, any dir in user root's path) because debian things (apt-get for one thing) use python, and have certain expectations
<jim>	the evidence that supports that is in your pastebin
<mrcloud>	nedbat: oh, wait, you said load_names and load_surnames but i think you meaned load_name_surname_ratios
<nedbat>	mrcloud: why are __names and __surnames different? you use them the same in classify
<mrcloud>	nedbat: __names is a dict with names as keys and the probability of a given name to be a male name as value. __surnames is just a list of surnames
<nedbat>	mrcloud: looking at your code, you never use __names
<mrcloud>	nedbat: line 101 (there is a typo)
<nedbat>	mrcloud: you have a typo on line 101, but still, that doesn't use the values
<jim>	sublim3__, -maybe- you can fix your damaged system by putting the original packaged python back, and try the upgrade again
<mrcloud>	nedbat: i have to use it after classify
<sublim3__>	jim: how would i do that. i tried apt-get --reinstall install python2.7 without any success
<jim>	maybe you can download the package and try installing it with dpkg
<nedbat>	mrcloud: one last suggestion: you have three places where you loop over lines in a file and skip comment lines.  that could be abstracted into a generator function.
<mrcloud>	nedbat: not sure about what is a generator, but ill take a look
<sublim3__>	jim: good idea i'll give it ashot
<nedbat>	mrcloud: this covers it, and even includes this exact problem as an example: http://nedbatchelder.com/text/iter.html#h_customizing_iteration
<sublim3__>	jim: i still get the same error .. :(
<mrcloud>	nedbat: one question regarding unify file loading. one of the files have 3 columns and the other one only 2 so when i split the line i get a valueerror. how can i solve this? let me paste the code
<jim>	hmm. in that case you may be at the point of looking at the forensics
<mrcloud>	nedbat: https://bpaste.net/show/c6454bf9e9be
<nedbat>	mrcloud: it might be difficult to unify the file loading.  at least you can unify the comment-skipping
<jim>	or restoring from your backup
<mrcloud>	nedbat: ok, so i'll preserve all loading functions. let me read your link
<jim>	forensics will take a good amount of time and effort
<sublim3__>	jim: yah unfortunately, thx for your help
<jim>	sorry that happened to you... if worst comes to worst, you may be looking at a full reinstall
<mrcloud>	nedbat: better? https://bpaste.net/show/8d5dab96ec62
<padawan>	hey guys, if i have a parent class with a method, and i write the same method in its child class, i then overide the superclass method right? but i can still call it with super, right?
<yhg1s>	padawan: yes, yes.
<tech2>	dyce: if you're doing this via cron, maybe just use the commandline tool called lckdo?
<jim>	the usual pattern is the child class's method would call the superclass method if necessary
<isifreek>	i forget, in unittest, do the setup and teardown methods run in between each test method, or just nonce at the very beginning and very end?
<isifreek>	s/nonce/once/
<papna>	isifreek: right before and after each test method
<isifreek>	papna: excellent, ty
<dyce>	tech2: apparently flock replaces it * * * * * flock -n /some/lockfile command_to_run_every_minute
<tech2>	dyce: good to know, thanks.
<nedbat>	isifreek: and they run on a new instance of your class for each test method
<untitaker>	might as well use pytest though
<isifreek>	nedbat: also interesting, thank you
<yvear>	what's the difference between unit tests & functional tests?
<nick_zwg>	with python 2.7, if using subprocess.check_call() in a try/except block, and you except calledprocessorerror, is the return code an attribute of the error itself?  i.e. subprocess.calledprocessorerror.returncode?
<nick_zwg>	https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html seems to indicate that it is
<tos9>	yvear: the latter means a bunch of different things in different terminology sets.
<tos9>	yvear: the basic answer is "there are different levels of integrations, and tests written at each of those levels."
<yvear>	hmm
<carljm>	yvear: unit tests are tests that test one unit of code in isolation (though the definition of "unit", and the strictness of the isolation, can vary quite a bit)
<carljm>	(also some people use "unit test" to refer to pretty much any kind of automated test at all, but that's just lazy usage)
<nedbat>	carljm: lazy usage, and the name of the stdlib module... :)
<dyce>	in java standpoint, unit test tries to ensure the method is minimal, and only does one thing, ensure a low cyclomatic complexity per method
<w3bcrawler>	'do one thing and do it well' :)
<dyce>	but python looks so nice
<nedbat>	dyce: it's the same idea in python
<dyce>	what is the naming convention for "private" methods ? __?
<dyce>	or is it better to subclass
<nedbat>	dyce: just use a single leading underscore
<remram>	hmm. my testsuite skips over some components when their dependencies are not met, but i'd somehow like to be able to assert what i expected to be skipped on each build machine (e.g. travis and buildbot)
<nedbat>	dyce: two underscores is unnecessary
<nedbat>	remram: use environment variables
<remram>	so that a test doesn't automatically start getting skipped because we messed up the configuration of that machine or some other bad reason
<remram>	nedbat: oh that's a good plan. so some custom skiptest() that checks with the environment if this is fine, then skip or fail?
<nedbat>	remram: sure, something like that.
<remram>	well thank you sir. this is most helpful
<salvakiya>	can someone teach me something about xml files? i know nothing but would like help
<igenius>	xml files have the pattern like <tag>datavalue</tag> similar to html, do you know this yet?
<matthavard>	this is from python 2.7's string library: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/2.7/lib/string.py#l378-390 what is the point of creating those underscored variables rather than just using the builtin float, int, and long.  furthermore, what is the point of string.atof/i/l if all they are is basically identity wrappers around int, float, and long?
<wooble>	matthavard: looking up in builtins is a tiny bit slower than a global. it's a microoptimization.
<ryancnap>	hey all
<salvakiya>	hi
<matthavard>	wooble: so if i've happened to import string somewhere, would it be faster to call string.atoi or just int?  and if i've not already imported string, would it be worth whatever importing overhead to use atoi/f/l?
<yhg1s>	matthavard: the string module predates both string methods and many of the features of the builtin types.
<runciter>	matthavard: i wouldn't worry about overhead.  however, string.atoi exists just for backwards compatibility
<runciter>	matthavard: https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#deprecated-string-functions
<yhg1s>	matthavard: it's not a good idea to try and make sense of it. just avoid its use.
<wooble>	in any event i doubt the difference would be measurable in any reasonable program.
<tos9>	_habnabit: i've asked you this before i think, but what do you do to solve the race condition on tagging a release with vcversioner?
<runciter>	tos9: which race condition?
<tos9>	_habnabit: e.g., i have a version.txt and a mypackage._version, they say 0.1.0. now i want 0.2.0. i need to simultaneously create a git tag, and also update those two files.
<tos9>	_habnabit: do you just always create a commit right afterwards with "updating version files"?
<in_deep_thought>	can someone help me figure out how to use os.getcwd() ? i am in a directory which celarly exists (line 1-2), and yet when i enter a python shell, os.getcwd() results in this: https://bpaste.net/show/4b465078b322
<igenius>	salvakiya - which xml parser are you using to learn about xml?
<tos9>	runciter: ^
<salvakiya>	import xml.etree.elementtree as et
<in_deep_thought>	i guess it doesn’t like file <stdin>
<yhg1s>	in_deep_thought: it does not "clearly exist", i'm afraid.
<yhg1s>	in_deep_thought: do 'cd $(pwd_
<in_deep_thought>	yhg1s: but how can i be in it if it doesn’t exist?
<_habnabit>	tos9, you don't commit those files
<yhg1s>	eh, 'cd $(pwd)' before starting python.
<_habnabit>	tos9, i put them in .gitignore
<yhg1s>	in_deep_thought: because of filesystems and processes and unix.
<tos9>	_habnabit: ok, and then how does someone with a fresh checkout use the package?
<in_deep_thought>	yhg1s: cd $pwd took me back to my home folder
<papna>	tos9: they install it
<_habnabit>	tos9, you run setup.py at least once
<tos9>	_habnabit: they'd need to run setup.py first to generate it?
<tos9>	yeah. ech.
<igenius>	so what do you need to know salvakiya?
<tos9>	alright.
<yhg1s>	in_deep_thought: nyes, it would. cd $(pwd) is not the same thing as cd $pwd.
<carljm>	tos9: i don't use vcversioner, so i don't know what special considerations that implies, but i always have a "bump version to x.y" commit and i don't see the problem with that.
<carljm>	that's the commit that then gets git tagged as the release version.
<tos9>	carljm: vcversioner is trying to solve "i should have to do one thing to tag a release"
<in_deep_thought>	yhg1s: cd $(pwd) has no output
<tos9>	carljm: (i.e., i should not have to tag in my vcs, and separately bump a version)
<in_deep_thought>	and i stay in my directory (that doesn’t exist i guess)
<yhg1s>	in_deep_thought: yes, it doesn't. it does, however, change your directory to the one that doesn't exist to the one that does.
<carljm>	tos9: yeah. if i were writing a tool to do that, i'd have it first bump the version numbers, and then git commit, and then git tag.
<yhg1s>	eh, from.
<yhg1s>	in_deep_thought: if you start python now, do you still get the same error?
<carljm>	i'd certainly prefer that to git-ignoring the files with version numbers in them.
<tos9>	carljm: yeah, the problem is you can't do that and also support multiple vcses.
<in_deep_thought>	yhg1s: ahh now it works!
<papna>	this "the repo is the distribution" thing is probably net good, but it does lead to a lot of folks with repos that include a lot of stuff they oughtn't need.
<in_deep_thought>	black magic!
<tos9>	carljm: well you can i guess, but i don't particularly want tools committing for me
<wooble>	i tend to bump the version number in the code right after i release something, then tag it when that version is ready to be released, so my dev version doesn't have the version number of the released version when it's not that version. :/
<tos9>	carljm: so i see why it has to be this way i guess.
<_habnabit>	carljm, also you that means you have multiple sources of truth
<_habnabit>	carljm, also what wooble said
<carljm>	wooble: i can't parse that.
<barraponto>	how do i check if a datetime object is within a day?
<wooble>	if you're never pushing unreleased code i guess that doesn't matter though
<barraponto>	is there a daterange or something like that?
<carljm>	_habnabit: what's your preferred single source of truth for a version number?
<matthavard>	something else i noticed when browsing string.py (now on the master branch; before on 2.7)is this `import _string` at the top.  where is that `_string` located?
<yhg1s>	barraponto: subtraction and comparison to a datetime.timedelta.
<matthavard>	oops link: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/lib/string.py
<barraponto>	yhg1s: how?
<barraponto>	i want to check if the timedate object is within i.e. april 1st
<nedbat>	matthavard: it's implemented in c. this is a common pattern in the stdlib.  random imports _random
<papna>	barraponto: a particular april 1 or any april 1?
<yhg1s>	barraponto: subtract it from the datetime for april 1st, then compare the resulting datetime.timedelta object with datetime.timedelta objects for the ranges you want.
<barraponto>	papna: april 1st 2015
<papna>	barraponto: dt.date() == datetime.date(2015, 4, 1)
<matthavard>	nedbat: but where is that c file?
<matthavard>	or is it even a file?
<editshare-ericf>	in python 2.7.9... in a finally block, is there any way to detect that an exception was raised in the associated try block?
<salvakiya>	igenius, i am trying to extract code from an xml document for editing in notepad... after i am finished i want to be able to put everything back how it was. the exported code would have tags so the program would remember where to put everything. i am so new to xml and dont know where to start. xml: https://bpaste.net/show/c2522d583805 desired output: https://bpaste.net/show/b21dbd5414f2
<tos9>	editshare-ericf: doing things in the except block
<papna>	editshare-ericf: no. perhaps you want to do something in except?
<tos9>	editshare-ericf: or the with statement.
<yhg1s>	matthavard: it's an extension module, defined in objects/unicodeobject.c.
<nedbat>	matthavard: turns out it's in objects/unicodeobject.c
<igenius>	salvakiya - so you want to know how to separate the tags and datavalues from an xml file and put them in a text file, omitting all the extra <></> syntax?
<igenius>	and you want to be able to do so in a fashion which can preserve the xml order and structure
<matthavard>	thanks yhg1s and nedbat
<salvakiya>	yes... after i am done manually editing the output document i want to put everything back into the xml
<carlgotting>	is it possible to use sqlite3 in 2 processes accessing the same db, one writing and one reading, without operationalerrors like database is locked?
<salvakiya>	igenius, my python is somewhat limited. granted i did create a complicated instance handling system. but i am trying to make a game with gamemaker and i hate the way gamemaker displays code in the gui... i am trying to extract the code for easy readability
<editshare-ericf>	tos9, papna: i'm not that familiar with the "with" statement.  i'll have to look at it more closely. what i want to do is some cleanup after a try block only when an exception occurs. and in the try block there are nested try blocks so copying and pasting the cleanup code at every except clause seems messier than it should be.
<_habnabit>	carljm, git tag
<_habnabit>	carljm, the problem wooble was talking about is: what version number is an arbitrary untagged commit?
<_habnabit>	carljm, it might not be in any release yet
<nedbat>	matthavard: are you looking for something in particular?
<tos9>	editshare-ericf: well yes copy pasting is never the right answer to anything :)
<matthavard>	nedbat: no just learning about our favorite language
<igenius>	so how do you want to preserve structure? with tab-indents?
<papna>	editshare-ericf: perhaps you should pastebin your code? :)
<igenius>	there are so many ways to show the xml tree structure, but probably most straightforward way is with either tab-indents or with symbols showing child/parent relationship
<editshare-ericf>	tos9: it looks like a context manager should do the trick since __exit__ gets called with arguments indicating the exception that has occurred.  oh, but the indent levels are getting high! ;)
<jeffspeff>	this link says that the e-mail module is compatible with python 2.7 https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.html#module-email    this link says that it's not  https://docs.python.org/2/library/email.html    which one do i go by?
<carljm>	_habnabit, wooble: i use .dev version numbers between releases. i certainly wouldn't want a non-release commit to claim to be any released version, whether the last one or the next one.
<nedbat>	jeffspeff: where does that second one say it's incompatible?
<jeffspeff>	4.0	python 2.5	python 2.3 to 2.5
<jeffspeff>	https://docs.python.org/2/library/email.html#package-history
<yhg1s>	jeffspeff: that's just the version history.
<jeffspeff>	but it conflicts with https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.html#package-history
<nedbat>	yhg1s: the table does seem to imply that it's not compatible past 2.5
<yhg1s>	jeffspeff: 4.0 as included in the standard library in 2.5, and didn't get replaced in the 2.x timeline
<jeffspeff>	i'm using 2.7
<yhg1s>	i'm not sure why it would imply that, sorry. it just doesn't mention 2.7 having a different version.
<nedbat>	yhg1s: the 4.0 row says this under the "compatible with" column:  python 2.3 to 2.5
<jeffspeff>	ok, i'm new to python, just making sure i don't assume anything
<yhg1s>	jeffspeff: the version fo the email module only matters if you are using it from somewhere other than the standard library. you can just use the email module.
<_habnabit>	carljm, ok, but how do you 'use' them?
<carljm>	_habnabit: i understand the desire for single source of truth, but i would rather have release-version information duplicated in vcs and codebase, than have the codebase's knowledge of its own version reliant on also having the entine vcs history present.
<jeffspeff>	ok, thanks
<tos9>	_habnabit: i guess the thing that makes me unhappy about not tracking version files, besides needing to install the package or run setup.py to even run tests on a checkout, is git's terrible default for tag pushing.
<_habnabit>	tos9, yeah :c
<tos9>	because now you have no way of knowing whether you're tagging the wrong verison.
<_habnabit>	tos9, there is --follow-tags now
<papna>	carljm: it doesn't need the vcs to be present. it just needs to part ways with the vcs in a better manner than cp
<yhg1s>	nedbat: but it's not talking about the email module that is part of the standard library. it's talking about the separate package.
<tos9>	_habnabit: with no way of making it default :/
<carljm>	_habnabit: usually i don't use versions between releases. why?
<_habnabit>	carljm, i don't understand your usage of the word 'use' here
<tos9>	_habnabit: oh, there is now apparently.
<carljm>	_habnabit: i'm probably not understanding your question.
<tos9>	_habnabit: in 2.4.1+
<_habnabit>	carljm, how do your intermediate commits get a '.dev' version?
<nedbat>	yhg1s: oh, that's very confusing, since it's part of the page about the "email" stdlib module.
<yhg1s>	nedbat: yes.
<carljm>	_habnabit: ah! i bump it to .dev1 immediately after release, and increment that number at mostly arbitrary times in between (if there's been significant changes). not a great solution, but imo better than having it always claim to be a "real" release that it's not.
<pcatinean>	if i get string '00:00' how do i turn it into null/false? (it represents a time)
<carljm>	the key thing isn't that every commit gets a unique version, it's just that non-released versions clearly identify themselves as such.
<garyoak_>	hello! i'm trying to access a config file from inside my egg, but i'm getting a key error from pkg_resources
<pauldespre>	hi everybody. is there a way to take a screenshot of a webpage without using a webdriver? :)
<papna>	pcatinean:    s != '00:00'      ?
<_habnabit>	carljm, sure. vcversioner does this by using git describe, and if the tag distance is >0, it calls the version e.g. 1.2.3.post4
<pcatinean>	hmm, good point
<hiptobecubic>	pauldespre, you need a way to render the page
<papna>	pcatinean: that will be false when s is '00:00'
<pcatinean>	:\
<papna>	pcatinean: s/\/)/
<pauldespre>	hiptobecubic: i thought so... thanks
<wooble>	yhg1s: nedbat: as far as i can tell there's no way to deduce from looking at that page that there even *is* an external module involved. the whole thing is confusing, and it's probably not surprising no one bothered to edit it for 2.6 and 2.7 :(
<carljm>	papna: i understand that a built distribution is different from the source codebase, but that's really a different distinction. i still want my source codebase to be independent enough from the
<papna>	i'm missing a backslash or four
<carljm>	    def validate_
<carljm>	*from the vcs that 'cp' is sufficient.
<nedbat>	wooble: +1
<carljm>	_habnabit: ah, that's fine then. i should read up on vcversioner :-)
<papna>	carljm: that's a requirement i believe to be wrongheaded and unfortunate.
<hiptobecubic>	pauldespre, you can embed webkit in a python app and use qt to screenshot it, though
<yhg1s>	wooble: well, yes, unfortunately it *is* the external documentation folded into the stdlib :p butyes, file a bug.
<carlgotting>	any lightweight, fast, concurrent rdbms?
<pauldespre>	hiptobecubic: i would need to do that in multi threads. but i will see, maybe i'll to my things in multi-threads, save the urls and open them with selenium to get a ss
<carlgotting>	recommendations
<carljm>	_habnabit: from a practical standpoint, my biggest issue with vcversioner is the use of setup_requires, which is a broken feature of setuptools. (unable to respect configuration of any installer other than setuptools itself when it comes to where to find packages.)
<mrcloud>	nedbat: ey, me again. could you take a look? https://bpaste.net/show/087155a6461d i implemented generators as you suggested
<fearnothing>	can anyone tell me why even though i auth to nickserv as soon as i connect, i always get shunted into the unregistered channel?
<wooble>	weird, the 3.4 docs for the email module say there's no separate version after 5.1, but theres a version 6 on pypi. :/
<yhg1s>	fearnothing: because you don't wait long enough for the identification to finish.
<yhg1s>	fearnothing: you can use sasl to avoid the problem.
<fearnothing>	sasl?
<yhg1s>	fearnothing: yes, sasl. https://freenode.net/sasl/
<ycyclist>	what does it mean when a multi-line string, delimited by three apostrophes before, and three after, is defined without any apparent assignment to an identifier?
<nedbat>	mrcloud: nice.  i would name the method differently, but it's cool to factor it out like that.
<tos9>	ycyclist: it means the person who wrote it is confused
<tos9>	ycyclist: and thinks it's a comment.
<dude-x>	+1 sasl
<nedbat>	ycyclist: it might be a docstring.  is it the first thing in the function or file?
<fearnothing>	huh
<mrcloud>	nedbat: regarding classify function, any way to simplify it?
<ycyclist>	yes first thing in a class, first thing in a function.
<fearnothing>	the how-to for sasl mirc script is broken =/
<tos9>	ycyclist: oh then yes, it's a docstring.
<ycyclist>	thank you.
<nedbat>	mrcloud: nothing comes to mind
<_habnabit>	carljm, yeah i know :(
<_habnabit>	carljm, there's work being done on pip to make setup_requires not so broken though
<mrcloud>	nedbat: thank you for your help. i really appreciate it
<ycyclist>	thanks again.
<carljm>	papna: your pov seems to require either a) accepting that one can't have the source codebase apart from the vcs, or b) accepting that one has to have two different layers of smart build process.
<carljm>	one to go from "vcs" to "source archive" and another to go from source to distribution.
<carljm>	i assume you prefer (b). to me that seems like needless complexity, to which one piece of duplicated information is preferable.
<_habnabit>	carljm, how do you distinguish between build artifacts that you want to include in a source distribution and build artifacts that you don't want to include ever? both go in .gitignore
<fearnothing>	anyone able to tell me what the mirc run folder is?
<carljm>	_habnabit: yeah. it's a bit of a puzzle to figure out how it _should_ work, but i hope they work something out.
<fearnothing>	doing /run doesn't work, i just get "* /run: insufficient paramenters"
<_habnabit>	fearnothing, wrong channel
<igenius>	salvakiya - your project led me to a realization that i could be displaying the xml data more nicely too
<carljm>	_habnabit: what i'm saying is that version number is (imo) not a build artifact.
<igenius>	you actually have a good project, but you'll have to think of how you want the tree structure displayed in your textual file
<fearnothing>	_habnabit what's the right channel?
<carljm>	and i think it should be possible to have (un-built) source archives apart from the vcs (containing no build artifacts).
<_habnabit>	carljm, i'm not even referring to that. what about things like yourproj.egg-info
<_habnabit>	fearnothing, idk
<pici>	fearnothing: ##mirc
<carljm>	_habnabit: i'm not sure i understand the question. myproj.egg-info is a build artifact, it doesn't need to exist in a source archive, so i .gitignore it.
<_habnabit>	carljm, oh, right, you don't need it in the source archive
<_habnabit>	carljm, i'm trying to think of what falls into this category, because i'm /sure/ there is something
<runciter>	a version number *is* a build artifcat
<runciter>	artifact
<neogeo>	anyone know how to use pyqt4 to use user/pass to log into a forum?
<runciter>	an sdist is a kind of build
<runciter>	and boo to pip for blurring the line between code stored in a vcs and a source distribution
<carljm>	runciter: i agree that an sdist is a build.
<chriswarrick>	neogeo: use a python http library, like requests
<carljm>	when i say "source archive", i don't mean an sdist.
<carljm>	i mean "a copy of the files in the codebase, containing all the information needed to build"
<dthor>	need some help with kwargs, or possibly getattr...https://bpaste.net/show/b80f8fa851f0
<carljm>	i want that to be independent of the vcs.
<the-compiler>	neogeo: use requests, or qnetworkaccessmanager, or qwebview (if you really, *really* need js and everything)
<yottabyte>	hey y'all, i see some apps on github run python scrips with the ruby gem "foreman", i.e. "foreman run python myscript.py", why is that?
<dthor>	function lookup on the above works fine using getattr.  i'm trying to pass an unknown number of arguments to the found function, however
<neogeo>	thanks chriswarrick the-compiler
<runciter>	carljm: that's a matter of exporting the code from the vcs
<runciter>	carljm: the git working tree is an illusion, after all
<carljm>	runciter: which is another way of saying "boo to pip for always building at install-time", which i totally agree with.
<carljm>	runciter: files on disk are not an illusion :-)
<runciter>	carljm: the *working tree* is
<runciter>	carljm: a build machine should have a bare repo cloned, and you should use git archive to extract a working tree somewhere to do your work
<runciter>	carljm: that makes explicit the relationship between the content of a commit and the thing that stores it and makes transparent, repeatable builds easier
<runciter>	carljm: it also lets you rig up magic to make sure you get, say, the latest tag
<nedbat>	dthor: you want *args, **kwargs
<carljm>	runciter: sure, that all sounds fine. (does vcversioner hook into 'git archive' so it can work with that flow?)
<nedbat>	dthor: and you don't need the if on line 31
<_habnabit>	carljm, (not yet)
<dthor>	nedbat, it is already optional then?
<runciter>	carljm: no, but it could, and it's not hard to do by hand since git archive needs a branch-like thing anyway
<nedbat>	dthor: **options works fine if options is empty
<carljm>	at that point it's a judgment call: when is this bit of information important enough to not duplicate that it's worth introducing this extra complexity in the vcs->archive step.
<dthor>	ah
<carljm>	personally i don't think version information rises to that bar, but ymmv.
<runciter>	carljm: i would say it's critical to determine what the source of truth is, and to only rely on that
<runciter>	carljm: so relying *only* on git tags was a huge boon when i rigged it up at one of my jobs, because you could be damn sure what code ended up in staging or production or whatever
<runciter>	carljm: and it was super easy to do a release -- just tag it
<attwo>	how good is the python simplecrypt as an encryption?
<runciter>	carljm: but you do have to realize that your source control isn't just storing some set of files
<attwo>	useless or?
<dthor>	nedbat, thank you.  i think i flip flopped right around that combination of args
<runciter>	carljm: so a simple checkout isn't actually a sufficient export mechanism
<nedbat>	dthor: is something not working right?
<dthor>	nedbat, it's working now with *args
<nedbat>	dthor: cool
<dthor>	nedbat, thanks
<_habnabit>	attwo, which one?
<carljm>	runciter: i understand your pov, thanks. i'll think about it.
<attwo>	it is just called simplecrypt sec and i'll link
<attwo>	https://pypi.python.org/pypi/simple-crypt
<_habnabit>	attwo, ok. i'd use cryptography's fernet recipe instead
<attwo>	so it is not safe?
<_habnabit>	attwo, i just trust the pyca people more
<runciter>	carljm: it's just, like, my opinion :)  i'm not sure there's any really good way to use git if you're not ruling the lkml with an iron fist
<carljm>	runciter: heh. thanks for the opinion, it's thought-provoking. i guess i am still hesitant to let the vcs be the source of truth for anything other than the history of some set of files (possibly across multiple branches, etc)
<carljm>	i still want the truth to be in that set of files.
<carljm>	but it's certainly possible that hesitation hasn't a good basis.
<carljm>	i guess it seems like a conceptually cleaner "separation of concerns" between the vcs and the codebase.
<runciter>	carljm: well, i also think frankly it's ok to be suspicious of your vcs!
<runciter>	they all kind of suck
<isarl>	hi everybody. i'm new to celery, so i'm probably asking the wrong question. but i want a long-running task to communicate with the process that spawned it, and the more i read the more it seems like celery isn't exactly suited to this style.
<papna>	carljm: i don't argue (a), i argue that doing so is a bad idea and not the approach one should take
<isarl>	so my question is, how can i perform bidirectional communication with a task i've started with celery, and if using celery is the wrong way to do this then what should i be using instead?
<_habnabit>	isarl, what's the task you're trying to perform?
<isarl>	_habnabit: i'm trying to process a large file. every once in a while my algorithm can't continue on its own and requries user intervention, at which point my current thinking is, have the task set its own status to something custom, and have the calling context poll the async task result looking for that status, and send the data needed to continue processing back through something like task.backend.store_result()
<isarl>	er maybe result.backend.store_result()
<isarl>	so, client connects to server, chooses file through some kind of restful api or whatever, and then server spawns off a task to process that file. every once in a while the server goes back to the client to say, "i need your help processing this part," and then takes the user-supplied data back to the task so it can continue.
<carljm>	isarl: why not have the "requires user intervention" points be the end of one task and the start of a new one?
<isarl>	carljm: that's definitely one of the strategies i'm considering.
<hef_>	if python is built in debug mode on windows,  does it look for foo.pyd_d instead of foo.pyd?
<carljm>	i'm not sure if it's possible to implement bidirectional communication with a task via the result backend in celery (i've not done it or seen anyone do it), but it seems like splitting into multiple tasks would be simpler and more within the usual usage.
<isarl>	i.e. have the task continue as long as it can, and then either finish with either a custom state (need_intervention or whatever) or with finished as usaul
<isarl>	*usual
<carljm>	isarl: exactly.
<isarl>	yeah, that's my thinking
<isarl>	so in the server, put the big file in memcached
<isarl>	then fire off a task to start processing it
<isarl>	task will finish either need_help or finished; server will handle that logic to either get input from the user and spin up another task to tackle the same file in memcached
<isarl>	or to finish processing the file and remove it from memcached
<michele>	hi there. i am looking for a suggestion for a python test framework. in the past i used pyunit and nose. it seems that cool kids on the block still use nose. am i right?
<carljm>	michele: py.test is also widely used.
<runciter>	michele: py.test has the best support for parametrization i've seen, which is very very useful
<michele>	uhm, ok
<michele>	time to learn a new framework
<michele>	:)
<runciter>	michele: not necessarily!  if you're writing tests, and they exercise your code meaningfully, why change what you use?
<michele>	well, you are saying that nose and py.test are exchangeable without modifying my tests?
<runciter>	no, i'm not saying that
<_habnabit>	depends on what nose features you use
<runciter>	michele: i just mean: you've got tools that work well for you, why switch it up?
<shlant1>	hi all! anyone know how i can return the status variable as part of the 500 error here?: https://gist.github.com/mrmmorris/c060125684b107a89e9b
<shlant1>	all i get is 'failure:'
<kirkmcdonald>	shlant1: status is going to be a string. so it won't ever equal 0. if what you're seeing is just "failure:", that implies status is an empty string.
<runciter>	shlant1: you're collecting stdout, which is never 0
<runciter>	oh, there you go
<michele>	runciter: that's right.
<shlant1>	kirkmcdonald: ah i see. so to properly handled succes/failure would i set exit 0 at the end of my bash script?
<salvakiya>	igenius, how is that?
<michele>	runciter: i was only curious about what's the trend today about python test framework
<salvakiya>	igenius, sorry i was away for a bit. i only got your last message
<shlant1>	kirkmcdonald: or return some string
<kirkmcdonald>	shlant1: you would look at the .returncode attribute of your popen object.
<runciter>	michele: i'm pretty sure the trend is still "not writing enough tests" so you're ahead of the trend!
<shlant1>	kirkmcdonald: if status.returncode == 0: ?
<shlant1>	attributeerror: 'unicode' object has no attribute 'returncode'
<shlant1>	or throw it on the end? .decode().returncode

<agent86>	hi python
<michele>	and the winner is: nose!
<agent86>	can someone help me understand the different with a tkinter .configure vs .update ?
<_habnabit>	michele, tbqh i don't understand why nose is popular, because py.test is just all-around better
<agent86>	basically i want to know if i change something with .configure(text = "something"), then later in the code after an event i use .configure(text= "something else")
<agent86>	do i need to .update each time i .configure or not ?
<agent86>	most of the .configure are just text labels
<igenius>	hey kirkmcdonald, can you help salva-kiya, i'm at my limit here
<michele>	that's the fourth person here that states that py.test > nose
<michele>	!
<chriswarrick>	michele: count me as fifth
<michele>	enough. % pip install py.test
<runciter>	% ?! what is this, tcsh?
<michele>	zsh
<chriswarrick>	% is best prompt
<runciter>	# is the best prompt d:
<chriswarrick>	and zsh is best shell
<michele>	chriswarrick: that's right dude
<michele>	http://pytest.org/latest/ <- py.test?
<chriswarrick>	michele: yes, they do crazy things with their name sometimes
<ic2000>	has anyone made a language in python?
<chriswarrick>	michele: pip install pytest    and use as py.test
<isarl>	another celery question. suppose my long-running task processing a large file is producing a bunch of outputs. maybe i'm grepping 100m lines of text down to 2-3k or something. is it best to put these all in a list and return that from the task? or should the task be putting them in memcached too?
<michele>	k
<michele>	thanks guys!
<michele>	have a good one

<iron_houzi>	i have lost my requirements.txt file. is there a simple way to parse my imports and generate a new one?
<apetresc>	iron_houzi: pip freeze
<apteryx>	hi! anyone would know how i can format a float value (2.0 for example) as an integer? (2.0 --> 2) i'm using .format() function already.
<iron_houzi>	apetresc: yes, sorry. i forgot to mention that i have cloned a repo where the requrements.txt file is missing and i have yet to create the virtualenv
<_habnabit>	iron_houzi, you 'lost' it? you destroyed your entire vcs history?
<iron_houzi>	*haven't yet created the virtualenv
<afidegnum>	hello, pls can someone offer me to download programming python, 3rd edition by mark lulz?
<apteryx>	like this: '{} {}'.format(seconds, sec_str)
<apetresc>	iron_houzi: aaah. then no, i don't think it's possible :(
<afidegnum>	i have only the 4th ed. which covers py3
<iron_houzi>	_habnabit: it seems like the requrements.txt file never was commited
<afidegnum>	i want the one that will cover py2
<sthzg>	could you recommend a package for python 2.7 that's as good as possible in detecting the encoding of strings?
<_habnabit>	sthzg, where are you getting strings from that you don't know the encoding of?
<sthzg>	_habnabit the file names in zip files
<jeffspeff>	for starting off learning python, is it recommended to start with 2.7 or 3.4?
<jeffspeff>	or does it even matter?
<_habnabit>	jeffspeff, do you know any other programming languages?
<jeffspeff>	c#.net
<_habnabit>	jeffspeff, pretty well?
<apteryx>	got it: timedelta_str = '{:n} {}'.format(seconds, sec_str)
<apteryx>	:)
<jeffspeff>	self taught as needed to make utilities for end-users where i work. like a conference gui that integrates with our voip system, and some other tools
<apteryx>	jeffspeff: why would you start learning a sooner to be deprecated version?
<_habnabit>	apteryx, haha
<_habnabit>	jeffspeff, ok, and what do you want to do with python?
<proteneer>	anyone used httpdomain from sphinx?
<proteneer>	http://pythonhosted.org/sphinxcontrib-httpdomain/http-routingtable.html <— how do i get direct access to this routing table so i can embed it in another page
<jeffspeff>	i'm running centos to develop this first application and i'm not finding a good repo to get 3.4 and all the other modules
<_habnabit>	jeffspeff, might as well stick with 2.7 then
<_habnabit>	jeffspeff, there's more things available for 2.x anyway
<jeffspeff>	_habnabit, from what i've read, i'll be making heavy use of the email mod, with some mysql databasing and something to scp a file into another server.
<sthzg>	to be bit more precise about my initial question: is there a best practice in determining the encoding of a file name in a zip file? i've encountered unicodedecodeerrors and realized that filenames from one vendor who ships us the zips use cp437. but i can't hardcode that into the lib (python 2.7).
<runciter>	what lib?
<yeryry>	try unicode, if that fails, use cp437?
<hopthrisc>	yeryry: unless the .zip was created by someone from austria or germany
<runciter>	if you want to treat filenames as unicode, you have to know their encoding, but they can be *multiple* encodings
<hopthrisc>	sthzg: it's a real mess.
<runciter>	if there's any way you can avoid decoding them, you should do that
<runciter>	i don't think zipfile cares
<runciter>	at least in python 2
<runciter>	sthzg: where is it that you're having issues with unicode here?
<sthzg>	i need to iterate over the filenames and filter certain files that i need to process further.
<runciter>	sthzg: are all the filenames in that particular zip cp437?
<jeffspeff>	i'm reading the info on header parsers here https://docs.python.org/3/library/email-examples.html   my information would be coming in from stdin. so, should i use "headers = parser().sys.stdin.read()" ?
<sthzg>	runciter i am pretty sure, yes. the zip is generated from one software (not ours).
<nanonyme>	jeffspeff, you'd probably be importing sys instead then and using stdin through that
<runciter>	sthzg: you will need to make the filename encoding a parameter you can pass in
<cswookie>	hey, all.  i want to do something that i'm pretty sure is either already done, or bad, so i'd like a head-check.
<runciter>	sthzg: there's no real way to reliably detect it
<runciter>	(you can use chardet if it's a real emergency but i don't recommend it)
<cswookie>	i have a class that tokenizes my programming language.  this class is subclasses, so that the language can have different tokens in different contexts.
<sthzg>	runciter a setting/parameter seems a good match in this case. was hoping to avoid it.
<runciter>	sthzg: nope, it's necessary :(
<runciter>	filenames are a monstrous pain
<isifreek>	what is the best way to validate an ipv4 address in python?
<runciter>	sthzg: on posix, a single path can be in *multiple* encodings
<cswookie>	i want to have a class-level dict of tokens, and then have subclasses have their own dicts.  they would look in their dict, and if it's not there, check the superclasses' dicts.
<exarkun>	i have a cpython 2.7 (2.7.5-5ubuntu3) process that's hung
<sthzg>	runciter :) to make it even more exciting.
<exarkun>	i want to inspect its state
<runciter>	sthzg: "exciting" indeed :(
<exarkun>	if i examine it with gdb, there are no debug symbols and the `py-...` macros don't work.
<exarkun>	what can i do?
<sthzg>	thanks to all for your replies. will go add yet another setting. :)
<runciter>	exarkun: pyrasite maybe?
<runciter>	exarkun: iirc it makes no assumptions about debug symbols, but it will try to acquire the gil and run code -- so obviously it's of limited utility with a stuck process
<exarkun>	yea, i expect that's going to be a problem.
<exarkun>	i don't understand why there are no debug symbols available.
<diminoten>	hey are there any libraries that are cleaner than subprocess
<diminoten>	like maybe a wrapper library that's a bit easier to work with?
<diminoten>	not that subprocess is difficult, just wondering
<runciter>	exarkun: can you get the debug symbols onto the box?
<runciter>	exarkun: if so, you can use symbol-file to load them?
<exarkun>	runciter: when i try, http://codepad.org/dagnaj95
<exarkun>	diminoten: "cleaner" and "easier" are subjective
<diminoten>	yep
<exarkun>	diminoten: can you explain what you're looking for in some detail?
<diminoten>	use your judgement
<exarkun>	okay, sure
<exarkun>	twisted
<diminoten>	someone who's written apps that rely on "shelling out" and might know of some libraries
<exarkun>	hth, hand :)
<runciter>	exarkun: hm, and /usr/bin/python-dbg is the same version/compiler/etcetc as the process you're attaching to?
<diminoten>	there's subprocess management libraries within twisted?
<runciter>	exarkun: what version of gdb btw?
<asdf`>	diminoten, sure; there's reactor.spawnprocess() and a processprotocol to help you communicate with the other process
<exarkun>	runciter: it's ubuntu 14.04, using the os packaged version of python
<exarkun>	runciter: so either python-dbg matches up or else ubuntu's debug packages are broken. :(
<diminoten>	twisted is just such a big dependency...
<asdf`>	diminoten, there's also eg. ampoule for when you want rpc-kinda-thing
<exarkun>	diminoten: it's not that big.
<exarkun>	diminoten: it's much smaller than python itself.
<diminoten>	"big" is subjective
<diminoten>	:)
<exarkun>	no, it's not subjective
<exarkun>	but it is relative
<diminoten>	it's subjective too
<exarkun>	i don't think so.
<exarkun>	twisted has a size measurable in bytes.
<exarkun>	its size in bytes is the same no matter who measures it
<diminoten>	okay?
<runciter>	exarkun: so an issue i had was that python-dbg is in debian based distros now being built with dwarf symbols and i had too old a version of gdb
<exarkun>	that makes it objective.
<diminoten>	no, that makes its size objective
<steeze>	i'm trying to write a script that allows me to drop a folder onto a python script, it resizes the image, and uploads via an api endpoint. im having trouble getting started with the drag and drop though. im using a mac and what im reading online seems to be outdated
<diminoten>	whether or not it's "big", however, is subjective
<steeze>	drop a file* not folder
<runciter>	exarkun: but maybe that's not an issue for you -- also gdb *should* be picking up symbols from /usr/lib/debug when you attach if you've got the dbg in place
<runciter>	exarkun: it's entirely possible 14.04 is busted, i haven't tried this stuff on it yet
<runciter>	but i can
<runciter>	one sec
<exarkun>	runciter: gdb 7.7.1 :/
<runciter>	ok, so that's definitely not the problem
<steeze>	should i use something like platypus?
<exarkun>	runciter: ah
<exarkun>	runciter: python-dbg doesn't provide anything in /usr/lib/debug
<ionelmc>	exarkun: do signal handlers still work (for that stuck issue)?
<mrcloud>	hi there
<runciter>	exarkun: python2.7-dbg!
<exarkun>	for some reason there's a separate libpython-dbg package
<runciter>	oh, what?
<runciter>	that's weird
<runciter>	dpkg -s has it in python2.7-dbg on my debian machine here
<mrcloud>	what i have to do while uploading a library to pypi to include data files?
<diminoten>	steeze when you drop a folder onto a python script, what does that actually do? call the script and pass the folder location as a parameter?
<exarkun>	crap, i already had that installed though
<exarkun>	runciter: i guess ubuntu screwed stuff up
<exarkun>	ionelmc: i doubt it
<runciter>	exarkun: one sec, i'm getting a 14.04 vm together
<diminoten>	or a file
<exarkun>	ionelmc: the only thing i've learned from gdb so far is that the process seems to be in `sem_wait`.
<ionelmc>	exarkun: but can you can reproduce the deadlock?
<steeze>	diminoten, that's what im trying to do. but it's not working. it won't let me drop a file on a py script
<exarkun>	ionelmc: i've produced it once so far
<steeze>	diminoten, i just want it to grab the file path as sys.argv and then id handle everything else from there
<zzattack>	asyncore.loop() causes 100% cpu use when writable() isn't overridden to not always return true. the example on python.org overrides the writable() body with "return (len(self.buffer) > 0)" - how does this prevent the busy waiting? there's still no kind of signalling involved
<diminoten>	steeze: i dunno if you can do that directly from a python script, without building an os x application
<diminoten>	there might be something you can do via an applescript
<runciter>	exarkun: you do have python2.7-dbg installed?
<exarkun>	runciter: yes
<steeze>	diminoten, right, i found something from 2011 but it was outdate. im thiking ill use platypus to wrap it up
<diminoten>	yeah
<ionelmc>	exarkun: you could try https://pypi.python.org/pypi/manhole if you think you can produce it again - it has various modes of operation, surely one would work
<exarkun>	manhole!
<ionelmc>	exarkun: i know right? ;)
<exarkun>	i don't know how to feel.
<diminoten>	poke yourself in the eye
<exarkun>	i don't think i'm going to be able to run python code in this process though
<ionelmc>	lol harsh
<diminoten>	he wanted to feel!
<runciter>	exarkun: this python process is in a virtualenv, right?
<exarkun>	and it took about a day to produce the failure this time
<exarkun>	runciter: yes
<ionelmc>	exarkun: worth trying
<runciter>	exarkun: because that apparently defeats gdb's symbol loading
<ionelmc>	oh damn
<exarkun>	runciter: ah, i knew there was a reason i hated virtualenv.
<runciter>	exarkun: well, it may be more gdb's symbol loading stuff is buggered
<ionelmc>	well, so your virtualenv wasn't using the python-dbg bin
<runciter>	exarkun: i don't think /usr/bin/python-dbg is the symbol file you want
<exarkun>	runciter: no probably not, but you used to be able to get away with that
<exarkun>	ionelmc: that's why `symbol-file`
<runciter>	exarkun: symbol-file /usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/python2.7
<runciter>	exarkun: you can see why virtualenv defeats this!
<exarkun>	runciter: indeed
<exarkun>	well, that's a little better i think
<exarkun>	although my c stack went from like 80 frames to just 8
<exarkun>	and py-bt won't show me anything
<dgarstang>	any boto peeps here? i'm trying to use add_user_grant('read', 'someuser') and i keep getting 'invalid id'. :(
<ionelmc>	for what it's worth, debug builds tend to not reproduce deadlocks (cause different timings)
<runciter>	exarkun: you've got to fool it into loading the .py files in that same directory (/usr/lib/debug/usr/bin)
<runciter>	i think...
<exarkun>	but now i can see that pythread_acquire_lock is above sem_wait the stack (gee i never would have guessed)
<exarkun>	runciter: what if i make a symlink in /usr/lib/debug that makes it look like my virtualenv is a legitimate thing
<runciter>	exarkun: i would be surprised if it didn't work
<exarkun>	i just need to make /usr/lib/debug/home/exarkun/environments/flocker/bin a symlink to /usr/lib/debug/usr/bin right
<runciter>	exarkun: yes that seems right
<apteryx>	i find it ugly to say: if a != b and a != c:
<exarkun>	not that i would ever mess around with system files outside of the package manager, oh no
<apteryx>	is it possible to use: if a != (b, c):
<kubast2>	hey ,could you help me a bit http://pastebin.com/9yxzfjcp . i've screwed up my first app[previously i've been playing around with variables ,if etc. ,self-learning]. i've used sample server code[i didn't understood the idea of sockets ,and it was extremly helpfull resource] ,and modified it for my needs. i want to make server app--it will work on local network-- that would allow me to download yt videos/music straight to my dlna linux box. it obviously
<kubast2>	didn't quite work [it all works nice ,until the point where it needs to recognize if the link is youtube.com or youtu.be ,46. and 54. if's are false ,as it doesn't print youtube.com on server side(it does print "not an https" ,when i input data that isn't a link)].
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/c4sqpzyfvizowzw5yh3a/ (repasted for kubast2)
<voodoonofx_>	apteryx: depends on your meaning of that statement. it doesn't do what i think you think it does
<kirkmcdonald>	apteryx: if a not in (b, c):
<runciter>	exarkun: did that work?
<apteryx>	kirkmcdonald: ok, that's what i was looking for. thanks.
<apteryx>	voodoonofx_: you're right. it does not work the way i had written it.
<exarkun>	runciter: bingo
<exarkun>	nice juicy stack, py-* working
<runciter>	exarkun: ok, excellent
<runciter>	exarkun: oh and btw thanks for all that work on twisted and all that work on pyopenssl!
<average>	would anyone like to give me some feedback on what they thing is missing from this ? http://jsbin.com/kusarutajo/1
<average>	thank you
<nedbat>	average: an introduction explaining the purpose and audience.  i wouldn't have expected "file uploads" to be the first thing to figure out, for example, so i wonder if i don't understand the audience.
<exarkun>	runciter: :)
<average>	nedbat: you're refering to "web backend programming" right ?
<nedbat>	average: "learning a new web development language for backend", yes
<kubast2>	ok nvm ,did a stupid typo with string lenght
<yasoob>	hi there!
<courrier>	hi all, i'm trying to make a class json-serializable, do you know what __super__ must be overidden to return the json equivalent? i thought it was __repr__ but apparently it's not, since it raises typeerror: [0, 0] is not json serializable ([0, 0] is actually my __repr__ output, but i think it's just used for display in my case, but this is not the real data that is being encoded
<bp-max>	how can i name a pypi package different than the base module?
<nedbat>	courrier: there isn't a magic method that json.dump will use
<exarkun>	if anyone's curious, docker-py hung in a `recv` call in a thread in a threadpool that the app decided it was time to shut down
<nedbat>	courrier: you have to subclass jsonencoder or something to recognize your class.  it's not great...
<exarkun>	guess docker-py's timeout logic doesn't actually work
<runciter>	exarkun: it didn't call that_socket.settimeout or that didn't work?
<runciter>	exarkun: also another reason why it'd be nice to have pthread_kill bindings in python 2
<courrier>	@nedbat ho ok thanks :(
<exarkun>	runciter: it seems to be based on `requests`
<exarkun>	i guess i'd be slightly surprised if the timeout logic in `requests` was 100% broken
<exarkun>	so i'd bet the settimeout call didn't work
<runciter>	exarkun: well, that is weird
<dewin|work>	well, the workaround is simple -- but i just found an odd case with closures and list comprehensions and i'm curious to know if it's a bug or not.  i can tell what's happening, but not why: http://pastebin.com/jsvrzvem
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/vxsxhv58tddhr5qniod6/ (repasted for dewin|work)
<yasoob>	hi :) can you kindly check this post? https://gist.github.com/yasoob/f69bbab4d3397af9ee3a and tell me if i have made a mistake in understanding iterators and generators?
<voodoonofx_>	what version of python was available in 2008?
<exarkun>	i could probably scrounge around with gdb some more and find out if this socket has a timeout set on it
<nedbat>	voodoonofx_: http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201109/whats_in_which_python.html
<voodoonofx_>	nedbat: ty!
<yasoob>	nedbat: can you kindly check it? it is a short read
<yasoob>	:)
<diminoten>	yasoob: it's condescending as all hell
<nedbat>	diminoten: how meta of you
<diminoten>	oops
<diminoten>	well it is though
<nedbat>	yasoob: i started it, but can't give it my full attention right now.
<dewin|work>	(hmm, actually i think i know the 'why' now too -- but it's still pretty unexpected)
<yasoob>	nedbat: nevermind. still thanks
<diminoten>	yasoob don't tell people if they're confused or not -- let them decide that
<yasoob>	diminoten: ok. any more feedback?
<nedbat>	dewin|work: as yasoob's piece will tell you, you can only iterate a generator once
<yasoob>	it is for beginners so thats y
<nedbat>	dewin|work: line 3 is not a tuple comprehension, it's a generator expression
<dewin|work>	nedbat: yeah.  that's what i meant by knownig the 'why'
<nedbat>	dewin|work: ok, cool
<dewin|work>	i know there are times where  comprehensions are quietly coerced to an actual list/tuple/dict, which made it less obvious -- that's just not what's happening in this instance.
<average>	nedbat: would you add anything to it or how would you reorder the items ?
<sublim3_>	after building python2.7.9 from scratch how can i test if everything is ok without installing it?
<average>	nedbat: are there things which you'd like to see in a list like that which are currently missing ?
<tos9>	sublim3_: same as anything else :)
<tos9>	sublim3_: run the test suite.
<nedbat>	average: sorry, i can't look at it now
<sublim3_>	ok that makes sense, but i was having an issue with my pacckaged version while importing 'hashlib' (see https://bpaste.net/show/79f08e2541b1). i just want to test if that import will work with the version i built
<exarkun>	oh okay nevermind
<exarkun>	docker-py explicitly overrides the default timeout with an infinite timeout sometimes
<exarkun>	not just overriding the default timeout but also any timeout the application specifies
<exarkun>	and not only that but it hardcodes none as the timeout so there's no way to have a timeout on this operation
<voodoonofx_>	nedbat: do you happen to have anything on your blog, or previous talks about doing dates correctly (with pytz, or otherwise)?
<nedbat>	voodoonofx_: no, that stuff baffles me :(
<_habnabit>	voodoonofx_, use arrow
<tos9>	but it's turrible
<diegao>	ho do i setup virtualenv to detec my env var defined in .env file at the project root folter?
<_habnabit>	diegao, what's .env?
<voodoonofx_>	_habnabit, tos9: that looks pretty nice. why is it turrible? :)
<moldy>	_habnabit: envdir, probably
<remram>	mailman's core runs on 3.4 and its user interface and archiver on 2.7? what kind of madness is that?
<diegao>	_habnabit: my file with environment vars used by the project
<exarkun>	remram: mailman is pretty mad
<moldy>	diegao: i think virtualenv has some hook you can use here. check the docs.
<tos9>	voodoonofx_: mostly because i used it for the first time, and found 3 separate things wrong with it in the first 2 hours, which is generally my metric
<tos9>	voodoonofx_: but hey, all that tells you is that it's the worst thing i've tried so far :)
<tos9>	voodoonofx_: (these were issues with its parser)
<moldy>	diegao: if not virtualenv then maybe virtualenvwrapper
<diegao>	moldy: yes, it has hooks like preactivate, postactivate.. and what about autoenv?
<voodoonofx_>	tos9: uh oh. hopefully they were edge cases and not core-functionality?
<dewin|work>	remram:  perhaps there was sufficient time to update the core code to run on python 3.4 but not the ui/archiver components?  or there's compatibility concerns with any sort of addons.  (i don't know a lot about mailman, just wildly speculating)
<diegao>	is it widely used?
<tos9>	voodoonofx_: eh they were fairly "core". i only remember one of them at the moment:
<remram>	does the new pathlib thing correctly handles nfc normalization on osx?
<remram>	(does it even know about osx?)
<tos9>	voodoonofx_: >>> from arrow import get; get("2015-04-29"), get("2015-04"), get("2015")
<tos9>	voodoonofx_: (<arrow [2015-04-29t00:00:00+00:00]>, <arrow [2015-04-01t00:00:00+00:00]>, <arrow [1970-01-01t00:33:35+00:00]>)
<remram>	does arrow handle leap seconds?
<tos9>	voodoonofx_: the other ones were tz related but i don't recall what.
<voodoonofx_>	tos9: oh boy. that's a pretty big one.
<zzattack>	asyncore.loop() causes 100% cpu use when writable() isn't overridden to not always return true. the example on python.org overrides the writable() body with "return (len(self.buffer) > 0)" - how does this prevent the busy waiting? there's still no kind of signalling involved
<_habnabit>	zzattack, use something better, because asyncore is crap
<movedx>	what kind of results can i expect on windows based systems if i do: os.environ['user']? just an empty (none) value i assume?
<zzattack>	_habnabit: regardless
<movedx>	(i don't have a windows system to test on)
<_habnabit>	zzattack, sorry?
<zzattack>	i know asyncore is crap, but i am still interested in knowing how guarding writable() helps in reducing cpu
<dewin|work>	movedx:  i don't have a user environment variable, but i do have a username
<_habnabit>	zzattack, it's one of those problems that's a non-issue because the entire system is fundamentally broken, so there's no reason to use it in the first place
<movedx>	dewin|work: so i need to do some checks, then. ok, cheers.
<dewin|work>	movedx:  keyerror, not none.
<movedx>	dewin|work: makes sense. cheers mate :)
<apteryx>	anyone knows what's the correct synthax to match multiples attributes of an xml tag with lxml? i always forget.
<zzattack>	_habnabit: right, that's how asyncore feels anyway. guess i might as well bite the bullit and get rid of it
<dewin|work>	movedx:  https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/getpass.html   see getpass.getuser()
<apteryx>	maybe something like: suite_elm.findall('verification/result[@type=fail|xfail]') ?
<dewin|work>	(it seems like that should be defined elsewhere, say in os, but it is an option at least)
<movedx>	dewin|work: great idea! :)
<memeht>	hi, i'm trying to scrap a site using scrappy, but i'm having some problems with the path expressions. i'm testing the expressions in the repl, and response.xpath(".//*[@id="mastermenu-container"]") returns "syntaxerror: invalid syntax", but i don't see any syntax error
<memeht>	scrape
<dewin|work>	don't give me too much credit, i'm just good with google and thought it was an interesting question.
<ikanobori>	apteryx: depends on if you want and or if you want or
<memeht>	actually, it's response.xpath("//*[@id = "mastermenu-container"]")
<apteryx>	ikanobori: i want or
<ikanobori>	something like //*[@attr=1] | //*[@attr=2]
<dewin|work>	also, i'm pretty sure there's nothing that stops someone changing that environment variable so be careful what you're using it for :)
<apteryx>	ikanobori: ok. so no compact way to pass multiple attributes to match.
<ikanobori>	well, what you wrote might work.
<ikanobori>	but i assumed you tested it.
<ikanobori>	afaik that is xpath 2.0 and i don't know if lxml does xpath 2
<memeht>	 ikanobori: i'm using scrape's selectors...
<memeht>	scrapy's
<ikanobori>	memeht: i'm talking to apteryx.
<memeht>	 ikanobori: whoops, haha
<stevejobsinhell>	moin.
<ikanobori>	but yes you did both ask xpath questiosn :)
<stevejobsinhell>	if i want my object to be iterable, as in to be used in a for loop, my object must implement next using yield. correct ?
<apteryx>	ikanobori: will use that way, thanks :)
<ikanobori>	memeht: it's because you are using double-quotes inside double-quotes without escaping them.
<ikanobori>	memeht: try: response.xpath("//[@id = 'mastermenu-container']")
<memeht>	ikanobori: ah, let me try that
<sublim3_>	ok so i tested that the lib hashlib works in my compiled python2.7.9 now i am getting an issue on make install --> 'makefile:1003: recipe for target 'libinstall' failed'
<papna>	stevejobsinhell: no. that is merely one way to implement next / __next__
<papna>	stevejobsinhell: what is the class you're writing?
<stevejobsinhell>	it's a matrix.  i want to do --> for cell in matrix
<papna>	stevejobsinhell: why are you implementing your own rather than using the widely-used matrix types?
<stevejobsinhell>	it's just a hypothetical
<papna>	stevejobsinhell: cool
<stevejobsinhell>	it could be any custom datastructe.
<ineophyte>	how can i fix "_ssl.c:492: error:14077438:ssl routines:ssl23_get_server_hello:tlsv1 alert internal error" when using urllib3?
<stevejobsinhell>	how do you make an object iterable?
<memeht>	ikanobori: thanks! it worked. silly mistake
<ikanobori>	ineophyte: you probably lack a cipher.
<epequeno>	stevejobsinhell: http://stackoverflow.com/a/4019987 ?
<ineophyte>	and that's fixable?
<ikanobori>	depends, what openssl version do you have?
<papna>	stevejobsinhell: you define __next__ to make an iterable
<papna>	stevejobsinhell: i'm sorry, you define __iter__ to make an iterable, i mean to say
<stevejobsinhell>	thanks
<xcyclist>	how do i make a python object immutable?
<papna>	stevejobsinhell: __iter__ returns an iterator -- iterators have __next__
<stevejobsinhell>	got it.
<papna>	xcyclist: don't mutate it or encourage mutating it
<epequeno>	couldn't you inheret from something already immutable?
<ikanobori>	sounds to me either your install or the server you are talking to doesn't understand the same protocols.
<unanimousarc>	xcyclist: you can simulate immutability http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immutable_object#python
<ineophyte>	ikanobori, how can i find out ?:d
<ikanobori>	so people tend to force a cipher set that downgrades the protocol.
<ineophyte>	ikanobori, openssl 1.0.1e-fips 11 feb 2013
<ikanobori>	what version of urllib3.
<simpson>	xcyclist: don't do what that wp article suggests. use collections.namedtuple instead.
<ineophyte>	last on pip
<ineophyte>	1.10.3
<ineophyte>	    import urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl
<ineophyte>	    urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl.inject_into_urllib3()
<ineophyte>	this didn't seem to fix it :x
<ikanobori>	yea.
<ikanobori>	sounds to me you are talking to a server that only does sslv3.
<ikanobori>	and you are probably on debian or ubuntu?
<xcyclist>	but mutables inside a tuple are still mutable, right?
<simpson>	xcyclist: yes.
<ineophyte>	i'm on a centos machine, and trying to contact the cloudflare public servers >_<
<xcyclist>	ok.  well, nothing is ever perfect.  thank you for the feedback.
<simpson>	xcyclist: well, consider: how would you turn a mutable object into an immutable object?
<simpson>	is there some other language you're thinking of that has this ability?
<_habnabit>	simpson, haskell?
<simpson>	_habnabit: haskell can't magically turn mutable refs into immutable refs though.
<simpson>	you can certainly freeze and thaw arrays, but only explicitly and only arrays that have opted in.
<_habnabit>	simpson, use phantom types to return values that don't support mutation methods!!!
<simpson>	_habnabit: but you still haven't changed that the refs are only available inside their particular mutable environment (io, st, stm, etc.)
<chimeno>	what's wrong with this? 3.x - https://bpaste.net/show/51beeed4fcac
<simpson>	my point was more that an object surely has to opt in for any kind of automatic serialization mechanism.
<_habnabit>	chimeno, that's not where the 'if' goes. what are you reading to learn python?
<epequeno>	chimeno: https://bpaste.net/show/cf32c41d22a7
<chimeno>	that's true!
<chimeno>	thanks
<chimeno>	both
<ikanobori>	ineophyte: then i have no idea, sorry. i know debian recently removed sslv3 from openssl and thought the issue might've been there.
<ikanobori>	does it work if you use curl or wget to access that website?
<ineophyte>	yes
<ineophyte>	ok well
<ineophyte>	wget works
<ineophyte>	curl not
<ineophyte>	curl: (35) ssl connect error
<ikanobori>	this some old centos?
<yasoob>	best way to learn something is to learn it as if you are going to teach it to someone else. :)
<ineophyte>	new
<ikanobori>	what about `curl -tlsv1 yoururl` and after that `curl -sslv3 yoururl`
<tos9>	ikanobori: 6
<tos9>	erm, sorry.
<ineophyte>	nope same error
<ikanobori>	also if it's cloudflare it's likely they use an ecdsa certificate.
<ikanobori>	and your curl doesn't do ecdsa (and maybe your urllib3 neither).
<ineophyte>	how is that fixable ;;
<keepguessing>	hi i was going through https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/ and felt that it just explained what the packaging ways or how to package. it does explain anything to a new user who also wants to understand why.
<ikanobori>	ineophyte: no idea further, if you can fix the curl issue you can probably fix the urllib3 issue. i'd make a bug report on either the urllib3 site and/or ask in the curl support channel.
<keepguessing>	is there a resource that someone has explains the python packaging and distribution story that works for a newbee?
<ikanobori>	where people who know a lot more about tls than me hang out.
<ij>	nosetests isn't picking up on app3/tests.py, but is picking up on app{1,2}/tests.py, even though they're identical. what might i have missed?
<_habnabit>	ij, maybe you forgot __init__.py
<ij>	_habnabit, you're right, thanks,
<keepguessing>	the peps seem to have a good description.
<stevejobsinhell>	is there a way in python to overload [][] ?
<_habnabit>	stevejobsinhell, __getitem__?
<stevejobsinhell>	isn't that for [] ?
<blaxpirit>	stevejobsinhell, don't forget that you can define  [,]
<_habnabit>	stevejobsinhell, there's no separate overload
<ssbr>	stevejobsinhell: make __getitem__ return an object that overrides __getitem__
<stevejobsinhell>	oh ok
<momoterr>	does anyone know why python in windows idle repl giving me funny characters substituting square brackets
<momoterr>	--- #python-unregistered :cannot send to channel
<_habnabit>	momoterr, idle is bad; you should use a real repl
<momoterr>	like?
<nacsurte>	will the pyvenv issue for python3 on ubuntu 14.04 ever be fixed
<nacsurte>	anyone know
<_habnabit>	momoterr, run python.exe in powershell
<momoterr>	okay powershell it is
<aka>	anyone have a suggestion for a soap client lib?
<keepguessing>	nacsurte, you told us the environ you have problem in but not the issue
<nacsurte>	keepguessing: the error is error: command '['/home/python/py/bin/python3.4', '-im', 'ensurepip', '--upgrade', '--default-pip']' returned non-zero exit status 1
<zefferno>	how can i filter a dictionary with a list of properites (without using cascaded if conditions)?
<_habnabit>	zefferno, a dict comprehension and a set?
<zefferno>	dict and partial dict
<nick_zwg>	using optparse, how do you make an optional argument that has no default value?
<_habnabit>	nick_zwg, that's the default, isn't it?
<nick_zwg>	oh, i see - it is the default behavior.  thought it was the opposite, sorry.
<zefferno>	_habnabit, ?
<_habnabit>	zefferno, ?
<zefferno>	_habnabit, i have a long dict and another dict with specific values to be "matched"
<_habnabit>	zefferno, okay
<amun_ra>	zefferno: i also have a long dict! (sorry, i couldn't help myself ;>)
<zefferno>	heh
<ajay2611>	how can i correct list index order after deleting an element from the list
<_habnabit>	ajay2611, 'correct' in what way?
<anderoonies>	i have a decision tree made of nested dictionaries...what's the best way to go about pruning an item at the bottom of the tree?
<papna>	anderoonies: del d[a][b][c][d] ?
<anderoonies>	@papna: that's the strategy i had been trying...the issue i ran into was that i'm pruning a leaf, testing if classification accuracy improves, then either keeping the change or recursing on the leaf
<anderoonies>	so i somehow have to be able to make a change and have it propagate to the entire tree for testing while still maintaining an instance of the tree before pruning. i was using deepcopy()
<anderoonies>	as it's recursive i need to be able to make a change to the current subtree i'm recursed to affect the entire tree for testing improved classification
<wldcordeiro>	can someone explain this kind of function signature? func(a=none, b='foo', *, baz=none) what is the * doing? is it the same as a *args but doesn't collect it into a variable?
<papna>	wldcordeiro: it's so that you can only pass baz as a keyword argument
<fiveside>	wldcordeiro: basically.  it means that baz cannot be a positional argument
<papna>	wldcordeiro: you can't do f(somea, someb, somebaz). you have to do baz=somebaz
<wldcordeiro>	i see.
<wldcordeiro>	it's just a way to force all args to be kw
<papna>	wldcordeiro: it is analogous to func(a=none, b='foo', *args, baz=none), except it doesn't allow (or collect) arbitrary positionals
<papna>	wldcordeiro: not all. only the ones after
<amun_ra>	and it's py3 only
<wldcordeiro>	so the * does collect the positionals but basically throws them away?
<wldcordeiro>	papna: right, sorry meant that.
<papna>	wldcordeiro: no. it *doesn't* collect them or allow them
<fiveside>	papna: it also throws an exception if you attempt to invoke the method with extra parameters
<fiveside>	wheras *args doesn't
<wldcordeiro>	it just ignores the positionals entirely.
<wldcordeiro>	okay cool.
<papna>	wldcordeiro: no, it makes them an error
<wldcordeiro>	oh thanks for the explanation.
<wldcordeiro>	this will make for interesting function args if the pep for additional *args and **kwargs collectors is passed.
<xcyclist>	well, in ruby you can execute freeze on an object, and all the immediate members are frozen.  local variables in methods stay variable, and class variables stay variable, but object variables are frozen.
<xcyclist>	so what i had in mind was something like ruby freeze.
<papna>	xcyclist: python doesn't have such a thing
<xcyclist>	btw:  it appears pycharm doesn't go on open java up through ubuntu 14.04.  anyone know if it's possible to install it while both traditional and open java are both installed on an ubuntu?   (seems unlikely)
<wldcordeiro>	xcyclist: probably a config thing where you set the path to openjdk. i'd check in their channel if they have one.
<diminoten>	i think i've run idea off of openjre
<diminoten>	or w/e
<diminoten>	3-4 years ago, too
<srpx>	how can i import a file that is a keyword?
<srpx>	"import while"
<srpx>	for ex
<amun_ra>	srpx: you shouldn't do that in first place
<papna>	srpx: no
<srpx>	why not?
<papna>	srpx: because reserved words are reserved
<papna>	srpx: why do you ask?
<srpx>	... okay then. that sucks btw.
<srpx>	there should be an import statement based on strings at least...
<papna>	srpx: well that's a horse of a different color
<papna>	srpx: and not what you asked
<papna>	srpx: in any event, that's a hopelessly bad name for a module and don't make such a thing
<papna>	srpx: why do you ask?
<amun_ra>	srpx: perhaps it isn't for that reason :>
<srpx>	of the dozens of languages i'll have to add an exception on my compiler specifically to python so it creates "lambda_.py" instead of "lambda.py"
<amun_ra>	srpx: try true,false=false,true in python 2.x
<papna>	srpx: hm?
<srpx>	well nevermind, thank you :(
<yeryry>	you could rename it entirely, then you wouldn't need an exception...
<papna>	srpx: go on.
<runciter>	compiler?
<diegao>	moldy: python-dotenv its just was i were looking for :d
<carljm>	srpx: i'm certainly not going to endorse naming a module with a keyword, but "import based on string" does exist in python.
<carljm>	import importlib; mod = importlib.import_module('lambda') works just fine.
<srpx>	ah thank you :)
<diminoten>	just enough rope, carljm :|
<xhfhx>	hi there - til now i wrote only "little" scripts in python and webservers - but now i want to get into real programms and would like to help developing the following: https://github.com/thomasvs/morituri can anyone say me where to start at such a big code base like this?
<diminoten>	xhfxh unit tests :)
<amun_ra>	srpx: but you won't be able to use lambda.foo that way
<speakertomeat>	do you guys have a link to a good example of a pythonic way of "try to do this for x amount of time and else fail" ? "do this" is call a method until the return is a certain one, so not a blocking process
<runciter>	speakertomeat: just busy loop until you get the return value you want or your timeout has expired?
<tos9>	speakertomeat: i don't udnerstand the connection between the two things in your second sentence.
<carljm>	amun_ra: sure you can, but it won't be called lambda.foo. if you import it as i did above, it'd be mod.foo.
<srpx>	okay i will just rename everything to "lambdalib.language" just for python. oh well
<runciter>	speakertomeat: sounds not so good.  what's this for?
<runciter>	srpx: what is it?
<srpx>	small runtime for lambda calculus
<runciter>	and you're not calling it church
<amun_ra>	carljm: still, it won't be module-name.foo as i was stating
<srpx>	that is a better nome now that i think about it
<amun_ra>	srpx: or better, rename lambda to lambdalib in all cases
<runciter>	srpx: it's going to compile to arbitrary languages?
<srpx>	runciter: i wanted descriptive names ... i almost named the tool itself something with church, though. except i noticed it had a religious connotation.
<speakertomeat>	tos9: i'm clearing i don't want a "try this blocking call for x time" but rather "try doing this again and again for x time"
<srpx>	runciter: yep
<srpx>	amun_ra: yep that is what i'm going to do
<speakertomeat>	runciter: wait remote systems to report that they're alive, and on the messaging bus
<runciter>	srpx: if you're compiling to some language, you gensym your identifiers for that language
<runciter>	speakertomeat: what's the message bus?
<runciter>	srpx: you could call it alonzo then
<speakertomeat>	runciter: sorry to ask this, but why?
<srpx>	that is just the name of the runtime not identifiers, the variables are bruijn indexed... there are no identifiers
<runciter>	speakertomeat: because busy looping is almost always wrong
<srpx>	runciter: that is good heh
<speakertomeat>	runciter: i'm not busy looping over the message bus. i'm busy looping until a local method tell me "yes, all the clients i know of and need have reported themselves as alive via the bus"
<speakertomeat>	runciter: and if this doesn't happen inside a reasonable window, i need to except out warning there are clients missing
<runciter>	speakertomeat: depending on the message bus, there may be a better way to implement this
<speakertomeat>	runciter: it really doesn't have to do with the message bus.
<speakertomeat>	runciter: it has to do with the master device in a flock waiting a reasonable window for other machines in the flock to be alive.
<speakertomeat>	and doing something about it, if some are missing in that window frame
<runciter>	speakertomeat: it does.  i had this exact same problem with marionette over rabbitmq because they didn't know how to implement a join across multiple channels, and we had some slowish clients
<runciter>	well, it was my coworker who found it out
<speakertomeat>	runciter: and your use case woudl allow you to wait indifenitely for the slow clients?
<speakertomeat>	my use case can't
<runciter>	speakertomeat: we needed to know if something ran
<speakertomeat>	if the other clients havent reported in 30 seconds, i need to handle it
<runciter>	speakertomeat: and the timeout would have been on the order of 20 minutes
<runciter>	speakertomeat: but we also needed to do something else as soon as we got confirmation
<runciter>	so polling every second wasn't good, either
<speakertomeat>	i'm not polling the clients, the clients push to the bus
<runciter>	polling the bus
<speakertomeat>	well i can do this not as a loop, but just a time.sleep
<speakertomeat>	the bus polling is run as normal in its own thread, nothing to do with the clients sending anything or not
<runciter>	well, this is all very abstract unless i know more about the bus
<speakertomeat>	i will do a sleep instead of a bus. i'll init. wait 30 seconds, and ask "is everybody accounted for?" and act. the sad part of this is it'll always delay startup 30 seconds. if they're all in 5 seconds in, i'll waste 25 seconds in a sleep
<speakertomeat>	dude, would you please, please, please forget the bus?
<runciter>	but busy looping is not a good idea
<epequeno>	does anyone have any info on how i could read data from a linux socket file
<runciter>	speakertomeat: this can be easily accomplished with a start = time.time(); while start - time.time() <= timeout: doyourstuff()
<diminoten>	time.sleeps make for very inefficient code
<runciter>	speakertomeat: or time.monotonic if you can get at it
<speakertomeat>	let's change the question. "how can i wait for a glass of water to warm 2 centigrades for 30 seconds, and act wether it hasn't warmed 2 centigrades or 30 seconds have passed in a pythonic way?"
<speakertomeat>	hmmmm
<speakertomeat>	runciter: woudl that be preferable to using a threading timer ?
<diminoten>	check the glass as fast as python can, and then bail from the loop when your time parameter turns false
<speakertomeat>	runciter: bus appart i see what you mean... i'll check down that path, thanks
<runciter>	speakertomeat: you don't want a timer because you don't want something to happen after n seconds
<runciter>	speakertomeat: you want to stop doing something after n seconds
<diminoten>	also be aware that this method will work in "n-ish" seconds
<runciter>	speakertomeat: but this *will* cause problems and *will* not work the way you want
<runciter>	speakertomeat: and also what diminoten just said
<runciter>	you should generally avoid explicit polling in your code
<runciter>	it scales less well, it and it makes it much harder to reason about when things actually occur
<diminoten>	this might provide some helpful information speakertomeat:
<diminoten>	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1092531/event-system-in-python
<runciter>	consequently nearly everything these days has an option to call a function when something finally happens
<speakertomeat>	runciter: if i dont explicity poll, how will i know if everybody is account for or not?
<runciter>	speakertomeat: it depends on what it is you're polling
<in_deep_thought>	i am interested in “data munging” i guess. idk what to call it. basically taking tons of really badly formatted data from different apis, csv files, sql databases, and piping it all into 1 format. are there any python libraries i should look into?
<runciter>	if you were watching a directory, you would use inotify, or kqueue or that thing windows has
<speakertomeat>	i'm polling if everybody is accounted for or not
<carljm>	speakertomeat: have them call you when they're ready, and accumulate until you see everyone is ready.
<speakertomeat>	i'm watching a dict
<runciter>	if you were watching a socket, you'd use poll, or kqueue
<epequeno>	in_deep_thought: pandas
<diminoten>	in_deep_thought: beautifulsoup4
<runciter>	no you're not, you're watching a bus
<runciter>	unless it's not actually a bus
<speakertomeat>	carljm: i have them push to the bus when they're ready, the bus sets their entry on a dict.
<runciter>	but if you *are* watching a dictionary, then you should replace it with something that lets you register observers
<carljm>	speakertomeat: right. change that.
<runciter>	which is a fancy way of saying callbacks
<epequeno>	le callbacks
<speakertomeat>	runciter: i have a callback, for each time a machine registers on the bus
<bstrie>	hi folks, does python have a langauge specification or is cpython the reference implementation?
<speakertomeat>	runciter: you mean i should check if they're all in on the callback used when a client registers or dies?
<bstrie>	i'm presuming the latter, but i know that e.g. ruby has some really old spec that at least tries to standardize things
<runciter>	sure, but if you want to know when an object changes, it's better to ask that object to tell you than to ask it repeatedly if it's changed
<speakertomeat>	carljm: why?
<carljm>	speakertomeat: so that you don't have to poll.
<diminoten>	speakertomeat: you can set an event to take place when a messages is published to the bus
<carljm>	speakertomeat: if you already have a callback for when a machine is ready, then there's no need for polling. just check if they're all ready each time one says it's ready.
<speakertomeat>	runciter: i'm told when an object changes, one client. you mean i should also check when a meta object (all the clients) "changes" in the callback used for when one object changes?
<carljm>	the all-ready status isn't going to change at any other time.
<runciter>	speakertomeat: no, of course not -- the meta object should made to maintain a set of callbacks it calls when certain things happen
<speakertomeat>	carljm: i don't need to poll for when a machine is ready... during the init process though i need to know if all machines are ready, in a time frame
<runciter>	should be *made
<runciter>	speakertomeat: you can have lots of callbacks!
<diminoten>	speakertomeat: keep a count or something
<diminoten>	*that's* the part you're hung up on?  you already have eventing??
<speakertomeat>	diminoten: i have a dict, but i'm being told checking this dict, or a count is polling and bad
<runciter>	that's right
<speakertomeat>	sigh
<runciter>	speakertomeat: i mean, you can do as you'd like
<runciter>	speakertomeat: i'm just trying to spare you some trouble that you'll hit eventually
<diminoten>	on callback, if len(your_dict) == size: print "yay"
<speakertomeat>	runciter: so you say make the callback for a machine logging in to call a callback to check if all machines are logged in?
<diminoten>	why won't that work?
<diminoten>	or w/e
<carljm>	speakertomeat: yes. and that's the same thing i'm saying.
<runciter>	speakertomeat: well, ok, to be concrete, maching logging == yourdict['machine
<runciter>	ugh
<carljm>	and diminoten is saying.
<diminoten>	len(dict) won't work but you get the idea
<runciter>	yourdict['machine'] = true ?
<diminoten>	when you first described the problem, as i understood it, you were sending a request to each of your systems for n seconds
<diminoten>	as in, you were polling for state
<speakertomeat>	diminoten: same reason why what runciter is telling me to do (same thing but with two callbacks chained)... because, i need to check this during startup process. and react if it doesn't happens within a time window, and if i hook this on the callback used when a machine comes in the bus, and no machines ever come in the bus because the switch is down, then this will never be checked, and the startup process
<speakertomeat>	will hang up forever and that is not an acceptable scenario
<diminoten>	that's a *totally* different problem
<diminoten>	than what you came in here asking about
<speakertomeat>	diminoten: how so?
<runciter>	speakertomeat: oh, i'm suggesting you decouple your timeout from your checking if things are in a state you like
<runciter>	speakertomeat: if you did *that*, then something like a timer would be appropriate
<speakertomeat>	runciter: as a way to stop everything... but hook the start process to the callback?
<runciter>	speakertomeat: well, again, it'd be easier to talk about if we could be less abstract
<runciter>	speakertomeat: if i understand you right you've got some_dict, the keys of which are machines and the values of which are... something?  maybe just true?
<diminoten>	what i've been saying was entirely related to checking if your systems were up
<diminoten>	now you're saying your problem is isolated to the edge case when none of your systems report in
<speakertomeat>	runciter: yes, true for reported, false for not reported or known dead.
<runciter>	speakertomeat: and you want to poll every so often see if a) all the keys you want are in the dictionary and b) all their values are what you want
<diminoten>	that's *totally* different, as a problem
<speakertomeat>	sigh
<speakertomeat>	i'll try, once more.
<runciter>	speakertomeat: so what diminoten is saying (i think,) and what i'm saying, is instead you replace that dict with a more sophisticated object
<runciter>	speakertomeat: that runs some callback everytime a machine reports in.  so a machine reporting is like, thatobject.machineready(machine) instead of dict['machine'] = true
<speakertomeat>	during the startup process, i need to wait for all entries on a dict to be true before continuing a process, but to do so only for a limited ammount of time before branching to another scenario.
<speakertomeat>	change "entries in a dict to be true" to wathever object and contents you desire
<runciter>	speakertomeat: one way to do this would be by maintaining a count, and when it hits zero, you call the function that moves on with the program
<runciter>	speakertomeat: *now*, if you want to time it out, that's separate from deciding if you've heard from all the machines or not
<speakertomeat>	runciter: what about the timeout?
<diminoten>	if you want a timeout, you have to measure time -- somewhere
<runciter>	speakertomeat: and you can even begin to think about implementing a separate timeout mechanism that could work in a variety of situations
<speakertomeat>	hmmm
<speakertomeat>	yes, that timeout mechanism is abotu what i was looking for.
<speakertomeat>	the most "pythonic" timeout possible :p
<runciter>	well, pythonic doesn't mean much
<runciter>	i mean, maybe guido would say that means using asyncio!
<diminoten>	i've discovered there is no "absolute" pythonic
<diminoten>	just a relative pythonic
<diminoten>	as in, "solution x is more/less pythonic than solution y"
<runciter>	diminoten: or maybe, "i like this solution so much that i want to legitimize it" :)
<diminoten>	sure, heh
<speakertomeat>	heh
<runciter>	speakertomeat: but what we've been describing will behave better, in general
<runciter>	especially as the number of machines grows
<diminoten>	in this case, what's going to be pythonic is whatever solution you come up with that most fits with the zen of python
<diminoten>	which is... subjective
<runciter>	presumably you're doing if all(yourdict.values())
<runciter>	that'll be slower and slower you get more and more machines
<runciter>	probably not so much that it'll hurt terribly
<speakertomeat>	the number of machines will never grow in this case. try to describe what you're describing again. because i never saw the timeout factor in
<gjvc>	hello
<gjvc>	what's special about the cpython python3.4m binary vs the regular python3.4 one ?
<diminoten>	what's the regular binary?
<runciter>	speakertomeat: you would have a *separate* timeout mechanism, one that hopefully could be applied to other, similar situations
<gjvc>	python3.4
<runciter>	speakertomeat: perhaps then it's a threading.timer, though i don't recommend it
<gjvc>	trailing 'm'
<diminoten>	where do you see the trailing m?
<runciter>	speakertomeat: maybe it's part of an event loop
<diminoten>	perhaps you see a -m argument?
<runciter>	speakertomeat: in any event, now you *do* want something to happen after n seconds, instead of to *stop* doing something after n seconds
<gjvc>	/usr/local/bin/python3.4m
<diminoten>	i don't have that one
<gjvc>	ok
<gjvc>	forget it
<speakertomeat>	runciter: why don't you recommend threading.timer ?
<runciter>	speakertomeat: with an object that lets you register observers, you want to cancel all further action after n seconds if you've not arrived to the state you'd like to be in
<diminoten>	gjvc: https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew/issues/32402
<runciter>	speakertomeat: you'll have to worry about thread safety, for one; another is that you'll have to worry about the lifetime of timing thread if you want to stop before you get all the responses you want and before you hit your timeout
<runciter>	of *the timing thread
<nmz787_i>	how do i find two items in a list that set() would consider identical? i wonder if these are /actually/ the same (i don't know how set() determines if two items are the same)
<spaceone>	is there a python function which returns the output of c's rand() ?
<diminoten>	spaceone: try the random module
<diminoten>	https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html
<diminoten>	dunno if it's strictly c's rand(), but why wouldn't it be
<spaceone>	nmz787_i: it simply uses "==" (which is __eq__ afk)
<diminoten>	also spaceone: https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#miscellaneous-functions
<runciter>	speakertomeat: also a lack of inspectability (e.g., how long until the deadline.)  that makes testing more difficut; and that plus thread safety will make it difficult to track the state of things
<nmz787_i>	spaceone: do you know if that uses a classes memory address, or something else? the class in question has a custom __repr__ method
<nmz787_i>	so i wonder if that is causing some objects to appear the same, when they aren't
<speakertomeat>	runciter: the idea of decouplign is good anyhow, to have the callback that receives the machines status pass to another callback who checks global status. probably use a state flag in the object, if startup hasn't finished call a method to do the last process.... and use the timer (wathever the method) not as a time out, but a timer to call something once, to see if startup is done, and otherwise, do the
<speakertomeat>	exception case
<jajaladodo>	hi
<spaceone>	diminoten: hm, i need the real rand()... maybe i write a c binding myself
<diminoten>	heh can i ask why
<diminoten>	also you say "real"...
<spaceone>	diminoten: i reimplement php's initial seed for a bruteforce script
<spaceone>	i dont want to write raw c
<_habnabit>	spaceone, cffi
<spaceone>	mn3monic: i don't understand
<spaceone>	mn3monic: sorry
<speakertomeat>	if you want true random, you need a source of quantum noise
<spaceone>	nmz787_i: : i don't understand
<hef_>	woot, got a python.exe building with _debug and not looking for .pyd_d files
<_habnabit>	nmz787_i, sets use __hash__ and __eq__
<spaceone>	_habnabit: thanks ;)
<nmz787_i>	coo, we aren't overloading those methods
<spaceone>	speakertomeat: i don't want true random ;)
<speakertomeat>	would i be lynched for doing this?: result = some_string.split('/')[-1]
<_habnabit>	speakertomeat, str.rpartition
<hef_>	speakertomeat: for path seperation?
<speakertomeat>	hef_: yes, getting only the last element in a 0 to n depth path, but not file path
<speakertomeat>	hef_: it's a path, but not a file path.
<speakertomeat>	hef_: so it's always / by the standard, not os dependant like a file path
<diminoten>	speakertomeat: probably fine
<speakertomeat>	_habnabit: let me check
<hef_>	speakertomeat: what if someone puts a \/ in the filename?
<speakertomeat>	diminoten: oh it works, i just wonder how much i'll be hated if i ever share my code
<diminoten>	no one will care
<speakertomeat>	hef_: err i need to double check but i think it's not possible
<diminoten>	only concern there is if it were actual paths but if its not
<spaceone>	_habnabit: hm, do you know anything about performance when using cffi? (it compiles c at run time?)
<hef_>	speakertomeat: no one will care, but you might if someone does something silly like puts a / in the filename

<gjvc>	i think uwsgi and might pypy use that
<gjvc>	uwsgi and pypy even
<_habnabit>	gjvc, use what?
<eckod>	hey guys, do you know of a collaborating text editor that is like bpaste?
<speakertomeat>	hef_: it's not a filename. and as far as i can see, / can never ocur unless as a separator
<hef_>	speakertomeat: what os?
<epequeno>	eckod: http://www.hackerpad.tn/ ?
<speakertomeat>	hef_: excuse me?
<hef_>	speakertomeat: is it part of a file path?  i was wondering if you are using a linux system
<hef_>	speakertomeat: err os means operating system
<speakertomeat>	hef_: it's not a file path.
<hef_>	speakertomeat: ah
<speakertomeat>	hef_: it's a path, but not a file path.
<hef_>	speakertomeat: what kind of path?
<spaceone>	_habnabit: for my purpose it is enough to use ctypes and load libc.so
<speakertomeat>	hef_: in this case a topic path in an mqtt message bus
<_habnabit>	spaceone, in general, ctypes is super crappy and cffi is better
<hef_>	speakertomeat: ah, ok
<anderoonies>	is there a way to pop an element in a dictionary from a sequence of keys? i.e.:
<spaceone>	_habnabit: ok, i will remember this
<anderoonies>	a = {'a' : {'b' : {'c' : 1}}}, then a.pop('a','b') to pop the {'c':1} off
<runciter>	anderoonies: a.pop('a').pop('b')
<runciter>	note that it's destructive
<anderoonies>	right
<anderoonies>	that's what i'm trying to do, i'm pruning a decision tree
<anderoonies>	it has to be dynamics, though, so i think i'll write a function that does it and i just pass in a sequence of keys to pop
<pdtpatrick>	question - how do i override attribute error if i call a class like something.blah  .. not the instance of the class. so for instance if i had an enum class like: class something(object): blah = 1
<_habnabit>	pdtpatrick, have you seen the 'enum' module?
<pdtpatrick>	_habnabit: i'm not on 3 yet
<_habnabit>	pdtpatrick, there's a backport
<schmity>	hey is there a way to select the nth item from a list of arrays
<pdtpatrick>	_habnabit: hmm i thought it was only backported on pypi
<epequeno>	is the nth item on of the arrays?
<pdtpatrick>	i might have read it wrong
<_habnabit>	pdtpatrick, it is, yes. just install enum34
<pdtpatrick>	_habnabit: i don't have that luxury
<_habnabit>	pdtpatrick, sorry?
<pdtpatrick>	so there's no way to override the attribute look up unless you create an instance of it? :(
<_habnabit>	pdtpatrick, are you trying to implement enum yourself?
<pdtpatrick>	_habnabit: no .. already got that working .. i'm just trying to play around and understand how i can intercept the error raised
<pdtpatrick>	just like __getattr__ for instances of classes
<_habnabit>	pdtpatrick, it works the same way with classes
<_habnabit>	pdtpatrick, anyway, if you want to use the enum34 module, it's easy to ship it with your code
<pdtpatrick>	_habnabit: https://bpaste.net/show/fed6b86166f5
<pdtpatrick>	_habnabit: thanks .. will keep poking around
<_habnabit>	pdtpatrick, i mean, is there a specific reason you think that third-party modules are problematic for you?
<pdtpatrick>	_habnabit: i cannot just install random third party libs at work
<_habnabit>	pdtpatrick, why not?
<pdtpatrick>	there's a process
<runciter>	but you've got ipython :(
<_habnabit>	pdtpatrick, good news! enum34 is bsd-licensed
<nedbat>	pdtpatrick: it seems like a __getattr__ on the metaclass could do what you want.  but what would you have that method do?
<pdtpatrick>	nedbat: i was just trying to learn really. couldn't figure out why it wasn't working
<nedbat>	pdtpatrick: another option: define the class, then instantiate it with the same name right there in the module:  class foo: ...;   foo = foo()
<pdtpatrick>	nedbat: thanks
<felqer>	question -- if i want to run two python functions simultanously, am i choosing between the threading module and the multiprocessing package or is there another alternative that might be better?
<nedbat>	felqer: it kind of depends what you mean by "simultaneously"
<nedbat>	felqer: what do these functions do?
<mlody>	hey. why this sql doesnt work?     x.execute("""insert into dashboard (title, slug, data) values (%s,%s,%s)""",(title, slug, data))
<mlody>	im properly connected
<mlody>	to db
<kirkmcdonald>	mlody: in what way does it fail?
<_habnabit>	mlody, "doesn't work"?
<mlody>	http://pastebin.com/glfvef5f
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/lbfqx2ektywjcxhakrsv/ (repasted for mlody)
<nedbat>	mlody: what do you think that error message means?
<speakertomeat>	runciter: btw that's the bust i'm using, an mqtt bus
<felqer>	nedbat: if i have understood things right, one is running a server and the other one is supposed to do measurements every hour.
<kirkmcdonald>	nedbat: (to me it means "don't use mysqldb.")
<terryleigh>	hi guys, how would i do this: regex = r"\b" + word + "\b" it doesn't seem to include the last word boundry
<nedbat>	terryleigh: use another r prefix
<nedbat>	felqer: did you write these functions?
<terryleigh>	nedbat: doh! thanks
<anderoonies>	@runciter: ended up building a cute recursive function that does it for me
<mlody>	nedbat, oh. im passing dict not string.. forget to make "json.dumps(mydict)"
<mlody>	..
<salvakiya>	question... in python using xml module how do i distinguish between <event eventtype="3"> and <event eventtype="4">?
<salvakiya>	example https://bpaste.net/show/c2522d583805
<salvakiya>	i am trying to extract code from <string>
<ionelmc>	pdtpatrick: if you're looking for metaclass stuff you could take a look over this http://tr.im/pymetaclass
<pdtpatrick>	ionelmc: i eventually got it working using metaclass .. interesting stuff. thanks for the link. will read that as well . much appreciated
<felqer>	nedbat: well, i would give credit to some tutorials
<nedbat>	pdtpatrick: if you didn't intend to instantiate the class, why is it important that it be a class?
<nedbat>	felqer: threading or multiprocess could give you what you want
<lseactuary>	hello. any expert python users here? im kinda new to programming need some help to determine what is best for my project. anyone know knows pig/scala etc also would be awesome. dont need technical help just advice.
<jakey2>	im trying to get sum into decimals how would i do this
<jakey2>	http://paste.ubuntu.com/10946426/
<pdtpatrick>	nedbat: i was going through someone's code and was wondering why they did something so i started experimenting
<pdtpatrick>	and now i'm trying to find better ways of doing it
<nedbat>	lseactuary: welcome.  go ahead and ask your question
<_habnabit>	felqer, can you post your code?
<nedbat>	jakey2: in python 2, this isn't 0.5:  1/2
<lseactuary>	nedbat - thanks! basically i have many projects coming up and i have limited programming experience so unsure which programming thing to learn that can solve a lot of my problems.
<yeryry>	jakey2: try changing one of your constants to a float
<nedbat>	jakey2: or add this line to the top of your file:  from __future__ import division
<salvakiya>	lseactuary, what kind of projects?
<jakey2>	thanks yeryry nedbat
<lseactuary>	mainly building tools. the audience are kinda not technically apt so it needs to be super simple but the back end is complicated e.g. pulling in big data, making it visually make sense, etc
<lseactuary>	having it dynamic and so on
<jakey2>	nedbat, saw a presentation of yours online for beginners in python it was good
<nedbat>	jakey2: thanks :)
<salvakiya>	lseactuary, do you want a graphical user interface?
<lseactuary>	can i pm you?
<felqer>	_habnabit: i guess i could, but i don't have it on github or anything
<jeffspeff>	i need to put a file from the local system (linux) running the python script to another linux system. what is the recommended way to do this? is there a scp module or something similar
<jeffspeff>	?
<salvakiya>	nedbat, lseactuary needs help. he needs a program to query a database which contains a large amount of data. he wants to know the limitations of python
<jakey2>	nedbat, right now im learning python2 syntax, should i just learn python 3 syntax straight away or is the difference between the 2 quite minimal
<jakey2>	?
<epequeno>	jeffspeff: subprocess or paramiko?
<jeffspeff>	i just found paramiko... i'm completely new to python, i think paramiko will do what i need.
<nedbat>	lseactuary: this sounds kind of ambitious for someone with little programming experience.  python is up to the job, you don't have to worry about limitations.
<nedbat>	jakey2: python3 will also be fine for what you want to do.  they are very very similar
<lseactuary>	nedbat - im an ambitious person :)
<r0b0t1>	jakey2: pretty minimal, but i'd suggest just using python3 as quickly as you can
<_habnabit>	jakey2, it's the semantics that differ more than the syntax
<jakey2>	ok thanks for the feedback
<epequeno>	_habnabit: i'm curious about your opinion. do you think it was the right choice to have python2's '/' operator perform floor division on ints?
<lseactuary>	nedbat - i need some recommendations please. is it possible to create something like a 'website' with python with data visualisations and then in other 'tabs' there is restricted access?
<nmz787_i>	isn't floor division the standard for integer math in general?
<_habnabit>	epequeno, i like / vs. // to mean 'true' and 'floor' division
<_habnabit>	epequeno, but it's a shame that python 3 didn't decide to get rid of floats
<lseactuary>	is there somewhere i can see examples?
<nedbat>	lseactuary: of course.  python has been used to create many large websites
<lseactuary>	nice
<epequeno>	so 1 // 2 should equal 0
<_habnabit>	epequeno, right
<nedbat>	lseactuary: you will probably like django
<nmz787_i>	lseactuary: flask, django... yes you can do access-control
<salvakiya>	need help. what is wrong with line 9? https://bpaste.net/show/adb7a3cc98b6
<epequeno>	i agree, i was thinking last night that the way py2 does it may be more familiar to academics and those doing cs but it seems to violate expectations for people who are not coming from that background
<nedbat>	salvakiya: why do you think there is something wrong with line 9?
<lseactuary>	can python pull in data from a pre-made sql query?
<salvakiya>	because it crashes
<_habnabit>	epequeno, python 2 does it because python 1 did it because c did it
<epequeno>	or it's always seemed like an odd wart to have to tell people about when they learn python
<nedbat>	lseactuary: python can do anything you need.
<lseactuary>	integrate with salesforce?
<salvakiya>	nedbat, https://bpaste.net/show/e8dfd21d047f
<epequeno>	ah i wasn't aware of the origins
<lseactuary>	nedbat so is python like 'the best' and i dont bother with pig/scala etc?
<nedbat>	lseactuary: https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/2014/01/python-and-the-force-com-rest-api-simple-simple-salesforce-example.html
<epequeno>	_habnabit: i don't understand what you mean about py3 getting rid of floats
<epequeno>	or why they should've
<lseactuary>	nice
<lseactuary>	shall i start with django directly or learn some python?
<_habnabit>	epequeno, ieee 754 floats are a terrible choice for almost everything, and are only in python 'by default' because c
<xulf>	hi
<nedbat>	epequeno: floats are confusing.  they're used because of limitations in ancient hardware.
<_habnabit>	epequeno, python already has bignum ints, the 'rational' module, and the 'decimal' module
<nedbat>	lseactuary: learn some python
<epequeno>	is there a resource that i can read more about this? this is definatly an area of ignorance on my part
<lseactuary>	ok
<nedbat>	epequeno: read about what in particular?
<lseactuary>	any recommendations on what i should go through?
<nmz787_i>	floating point takes more processing to use
<nedbat>	nmz787_i: more than what?
<nmz787_i>	fixed-point
<nmz787_i>	or integer math
<epequeno>	i guess floating point vs the rest i don't really know how these are handled
<epequeno>	at a low level i mean
<epequeno>	if anything comes to mind i'd appreciate it but i'll just google around a bit
<nmz787_i>	epequeno: integer math is a lot simpler from a computer's perspective
<nmz787_i>	or at least takes less operations to get an answer
<jeffspeff>	is this syntax correct? fn is a string var previously set... scp.put(fn, '/var/spool/received/tmp/' + fn)
<nmz787_i>	epequeno: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/floating-point_unit
<nmz787_i>	epequeno: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arithmetic_logic_unit
<epequeno>	nmz787_i: thank you
<epequeno>	i'm also reading through this at the moment: http://docs.oracle.com/cd/e19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html
<lseactuary>	nedbat any recommended readings?
<nedbat>	lseactuary: have you programmed before?
<lseactuary>	ye
<lseactuary>	r, sql, tableau do they count?
<nmz787_i>	code academy seemed decent for just getting you used to the syntax lseactuary
<nmz787_i>	(i knew python before i ever logged onto code academy, but was trying to teach some kid)
<lseactuary>	kk
<epequeno>	i personally like codeschool but matter of preference i guess
<lseactuary>	i just went on its cool
<lseactuary>	thx!
<fumbles>	i'm attempting to write a script to rename screen logs i have to append them with the current time since they are only date stamped without hh:mm. is python able to get those attributes from the os? as in retrieve most recent time opened/edited.
<epequeno>	of all the resources i've looked at i think this provides the most clarity: https://docs.python.org/2/library/decimal.html
<spaceone>	is it possible to make attributes from datetime object writeable?
<epequeno>	_habnabit: i didn't find a 'rational' module, did you mean 'fractions'?
<nedbat>	spaceone: no, you need to make new datetimes
<_habnabit>	epequeno, yeah that one
<spaceone>	nedbat: ok
<nedbat>	fumbles: os.stat(fname) will return lots of useful information: https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.stat
<epequeno>	i never really noticed how screwy floating point is. i new it'd do odd things sometimes but 1.1 + 2.2 even gets borked
<_habnabit>	epequeno, it's not 'borked'; it's just not exactly representable
<nedbat>	epequeno: it's just the same way that 1/3 gets "borked" in decimal.
<fumbles>	epequeno awesome! thanks! st_mtime seems perfect
<jeffspeff>	can someone tell me what i'm doing wrong with this scp test? the code and error are included https://gist.github.com/jeffclay/ccc2c696db16119d0f0e
<plasteredparrot>	jeffspeff:
<plasteredparrot>	jeffspeff: you've put in the port number as a string, it wants an int
<plasteredparrot>	i.e. 22 not "22"
<jeffspeff>	in the famous words of homer simpson... doh!
<jeffspeff>	lol
<jeffspeff>	thanks
<plasteredparrot>	no worries, we all miss some obvious ones occasionally
<jeffspeff>	oh crap, i just got a msg from "infobob" saying that this is a no "l o l" zone
<jeffspeff>	:p
<jim>	nolol rhymes with cobol
<jeffspeff>	i see what you did there
<jeffspeff>	plasteredparrot, changing the str to an int did the trick, thanks
<xndrk>	i remember python supporting ternary logic, but i can't remember how.
<xndrk>	is it spam ? eggs : bereft_of_life?
<xndrk>	or spam if eggs else bereft_of_life?
<cast>	a = x if y else z
<xndrk>	okay, thanks.
<intergage`>	hey all, not sure if this is going to be enough information to help me but the following is a little plugin for an irc bot https://bpaste.net/show/1261f38426d5
<nedbat>	intergage`: what's the problem?
<intergage`>	i was just wondering if someone can help me understand why when i run the 'yay' command on the channel it returns 'working...' but i can't get it to run the yay.yay_pimp() at all.
<nedbat>	intergage`: the first return ends the function
<nedbat>	intergage`: but also, yay_pimp is not defined right. how to fix it depends on how you want it to work.
<vorondao>	hey guys. new to python... trying to find a good soap lib. book recommended soappy, but soappy docs say to use suds... but suds looks like it was abandoned in 2010.
<vorondao>	and suggestions for a good library for making soap calls?
<nedbat>	vorondao: i'm not sure there is a good soap library.  soap + python is not a popular combination
<intergage`>	i'm really just doing this to understand how the plugins and commands worth nedbat so if i could get both of them do return to the channel that would be awesome.
<jim>	vorondao, are you interested in soap to follow the book?
<vorondao>	no, i've got a pet project going that needs to interface with an api only exposed via soap. wanted to get my feet wet with python
<sartan>	rest
<vorondao>	i know. i'd prefer rest, but in this case it isn't an option unfortunately.
<nedbat>	intergage`: whatever text you want to appear in the channel, make it be one string return by one return statement.
<skift>	if i am not doing any scientific processing, what are the use cases if any for using ipython notebook? i have seen some people render then online, which is kinda interesting.
<intergage`>	so something like 'ruturn ('working...' + yay.yay_pimp())' but i have to define yay_pimp() in yayplugin first hey?
<nedbat>	skift: any time you want a sequential presentation of your code would be a good time to use a notebook
<nedbat>	intergage`: something like that, yes
<intergage`>	thanks nedbat. as long as i'm on the right track haha.
<skift>	ok, but why not copy and paste from the terminal into a <code> block in your page.
<nedbat>	skift: because it runs live in a notebook
<average>	maybe people here remember when i was rambling about memory leaks here in #python ?
<average>	well.. guess what.. http://blog.gingerlime.com/2011/django-memory-leaks-part-i/
<average>	very good description about memory consumption problems in python ^^
<average>	the discussion is around web applications
<vorondao>	thanks for the responses nedbat and jim - so what it sounds like i'm hearing is there really isn't a good soap client. or that python isn't a good fit for that.
<skift>	ah, i haven't read any that shows the code running live or anything. maybe i just have not noticed them?
<nedbat>	vorondao: it's not so much that python isn't a good fit, just that there doesn't seem to be any interest in soap in the python world.
<vorondao>	nedbat: understandably so as well, i suppose.
<vorondao>	nedbat: thanks all the same!
<rmwdeveloper>	is it possible to have a dict key as a variable thats equal to a string? like example_key = 'example_key'  and example_dict = {example_key : 1}
<nedbat>	rmwdeveloper: sure, did you try it?
<rmwdeveloper>	i get invalid syntax, let me try again
<dothak>	hello
<dothak>	i have a question that i'm unable to figure out through googling
<rmwdeveloper>	duhh it worked
<dothak>	i was hoping to get some guidance?
<nedbat>	dothak: ask! :)
<dothak>	i'm trying to do some basic "frequency' analysis
<dothak>	figure out how many times something happens during 7 days
<dothak>	and put that in a dict
<dothak>	how can i keep track of different counts?
<nedbat>	dothak: sounds like a dict would be a good choice
<jim>	put em in some sort of storage?
<dothak>	yup, but i don't know how i can track the different counts..
<nedbat>	dothak: do you understand how dicts work?
<dothak>	kinda
<dothak>	hashmap
<dothak>	key/value pairing
<nedbat>	dothak: yes. so you can have many different keys, each with a count as a value
<dothak>	right, but the problem is each key value would be different
<nedbat>	dothak: i don't understand the problem.  counts = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
<jim>	a little confusion, you said key value
<dothak>	right, but i can't just get away with a single count = count + 1
<yeryry>	count["a"] +=1
<nedbat>	dothak: counts['a'] += 1
<dothak>	ohh.
<nedbat>	dothak: you'll find collections.counter very useful for this
<dothak>	nedbat: i'll look at that..thanks!
<average>	very nicely done article. i love it http://blog.gingerlime.com/2011/django-memory-leaks-part-ii/
<jim>	one thing that worries me is you'll have to have the4 program running over weeks
<average>	whoever wrote this .. many kudos
<average>	if you're in #python gingerlime, i salute you :)
<yeryry>	save the data whenever it changes, and load it on program start
<average>	nedbat: you read gingerlime's stuff ? ^^ it's excellent
<nedbat>	average: i'll have to take a look
<jim>	or write a program that updates a count, and another that does the analysis
<yeryry>	or do the analysis as each count is received
<jim>	yes, if the analysis is such that it can be done incrementally
<yeryry>	what is it counting, and how, anyway?
<freezingcold>	what way would you suggest handling socks proxies in python 3?
<jim>	lots of choices... maybe you could look into postgresql (for storage) and psycopg2 (wrong spelling, sec)
<jim>	the latter is a connector between postgres and python
<jim>	maybe it's overkill?
<yeryry>	if it's something simple, pickle or even just a text file would work...
<jim>	yeal
<jim>	so postgres is most likely overkill if you don't use it for other parts of the same project, and, it would be pretty easy to output hash keys and values to a text file
<yeryry>	or depending what the data is... have this program just log what happened, and maybe the time etc, to a text file, then parse that with a different program to count the events and do whatever it is you're wanting...
<macuser>	so if pip keeps installing stuff to my /usr/local/python instead of my /library/frameworks/ one what do i do?
<freezingcold>	hmm, i could use socksipy, or i could manually fsck with the socket.
<jim>	which pip?
<jim>	macuser, you would use the pip installed with the /library/etc one
<macuser>	jim: how?
<jim>	first find that pip
<macuser>	which pip gives me usr/local/bin/pip
<nedbat>	macuser: if you don't mind me asking, why is it a problem that it goes to /usr/local?
<macuser>	nedbat: because my python that i'm using is a differeont one
<macuser>	different*
<therealtbe>	hey i'm trying to parse a packet and it is printing out like this in numpy:   'g\xb4\x19\x01\x07\x08\x08\x06'
<nedbat>	macuser: you don't want to use /usr/local/bin/python?
<jim>	what's the exact path to the python you're using?
<therealtbe>	hey i'm trying to parse a packet and it is printing out like this in numpy:   'g\xb4\x19\x01\x07\x08\x08\x06'    what is this and how can i manipulate it?
<macuser>	 /library/frameworks/python.framework/versions/2.7/bin/python
<jim>	ok look in /library/frameworks/python.framework/versions/2.7/bin/
<dereckson>	hi. i'm fixing a code with pyflakes and i've seen a constrcut like available.append((dumpfailed, age, db)) ; available.sort() ; return [db for (failed, age, db) in available]. how would you rewrite this to avoid to reassign age?
<jim>	is there a pip in there?
<macuser>	jim: there is not
<jim>	hmm. so you would then need to install pip there
<nedbat>	macuser: if you use virtualenv, this will all be solved
<macuser>	nedbat: i know i am
<macuser>	for the time being
<macuser>	i just kind of want to fix this
<nedbat>	macuser: i'm not sure why you'd want to spend time making a thing work only to stop using it later, but you need to install pip in that python.
<macuser>	nedbat: ok. i'm not sure how to do that though
<dothak>	install pip?
<dothak>	install python-setuptools
<therealtbe>	'g\xb4\x19\x01\x07\x08\x08\x06'      it's some kind of hex byte string?  how to i parse this ?
<jim>	since you don't have it yet, you would have to download a tarball of it
<jim>	therealtbe, parsing requires you know something about what you're parsing
<nedbat>	macuser: get the tarball from here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/6.1.1  unpack it.  there will be a setup.py in it.  run "python setup.py install"
<therealtbe>	jim it looks like about 8 hex bytes, possible in a string
<macuser>	nedbat: hen what do i do with it?
<macuser>	then*
<nedbat>	macuser: then pip will be installed
<macuser>	how do i know it's installing where i want it?
<jim>	macuser, what does "which python" say?
<macuser>	 /library/frameworks/python.framework/versions/2.7/bin/python
<jim>	macuser, and that's the python you use, and you want to install other stuff to?
<macuser>	i guess so
<macuser>	unless you think i  should change my python location
<jim>	assuming you don't change the location, is that the one?
<nedbat>	macuser: wait, we suggested using a different python before, and you said you wanted to use this one.
<rasi>	{'bla': 'foo', 'bla2': 'foo2', 'bla2': '[foo, bar]', 'bla4': '[bar, foo]'} < how can i transform such a dict into one without lists? (i want the first item of each list only)
<nedbat>	rasi: are those values really all strings, some of which look like lists?
<macuser>	nedbat: ?
<macuser>	which python
<macuser>	?
<rasi>	python3
<macuser>	no
<rasi>	ah, sorry
<jim>	macuser, the way installing works, the python you use implies the python you want to install onto
<macuser>	ah ok
<macuser>	cool
<rasi>	nedbat: yes, those are really lists
<macuser>	so any certain location you recommend my python be in?
<nedbat>	macuser: you aren't going to move your python.  you should choose one of your pythons and stick with it.
<jim>	macuser, and more: the pip you use implies which python you install to
<rasi>	nedbat: proper example: https://fb.53280.de/kegk/
<rasi>	look at the 'track" value
<rasi>	its an error in mpd protocol, under certain condiditions it lists the value twice
<nedbat>	rasi: right, it's a string, not a list.
<scottsteiner>	why does re.split('(\d+[hmsd])', '7h59m30s') return ['', '7h', '', '59m', '', '30s', ''] instead of ['7h','59m', '30s']?
<uxeruospr>	i continue to get this error when installing pygtk in ubuntu using pip.  any insight on what the cause is?  "command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-build-enp2j8hd/pygtk"
<yeryry>	that seems like a strange thing to use re.split for
<rasi>	nedbat: oh... but python interprets it as a list when trying to work with it
<nedbat>	scottsteiner: because that is the string, once you use that pattern as the splitter.  there are empty strings between the patterns.
<wleslie>	scottsteiner: the regex describes the separator
<nedbat>	rasi: i don't see how.  can you show me?
<nedbat>	scottsteiner: maybe you just want findall?
<wleslie>	scottsteiner: consider ":f:o:o".split()
<wleslie>	er
<wleslie>	scottsteiner: consider ":f:o:o".split(":")
<scottsteiner>	yeryry: trying to do a re split on youtube's new api to try and make it more sane (convert into seconds)
<wleslie>	scottsteiner: look like you want a .findall
<scottsteiner>	ah yeah, not sure why i didnt think of that.  thanks
<rasi>	nedbat: ooooooh, you are right. fun. python just saved me lots of trouble. dont ask how, but thanks :p
<isaac_rks>	does anyone know why csv.writer could still be quoting all fields, even with quoting=quote_minimal set?
<isaac_rks>	i.e. it's also quoting blank fields
<jim>	isaac_rks, i think that's what a csv is... so when you read it, it comes back the way it was when you wrote it
<isaac_rks>	huh
<jim>	it may be a syntax error to have two commas in a row (without a value inbetween)
<isaac_rks>	true, true
<jim>	so probably its only choice would be to quote a blank value
<jim>	the writer's only choice that is
<isaac_rks>	it seems you're correct, thanks
<isaac_rks>	importing csvs through sqlalchemy is a pain, got daymn
<yeryry>	that's a self-imposed limitation, if so... plenty of csv files have runs of commas...
<therealtbe>	'h\xb4\x19\x01\x07\x08\x08\x06'   supposed to by bytes 0-7 somehow ?
<isaac_rks>	sqlalchemy is a pain full stop
<isaac_rks>	might just go back to raw sql
<jim>	postgres ftw!
<yeryry>	that's 8 bytes, but not of 0-7...
<therealtbe>	how do i split 'h\xb4\x19\x01\x07\x08\x08\x06'  into bytes 0 thru 7
<isaac_rks>	im using postgres, and i discovered the copy command which would be everything i needed
<isaac_rks>	but i decided to go with sqlalchemy at the beginning and am experiencing ``technical debt'' :/
<kirkmcdonald>	therealtbe: i don't understand the question.
<yeryry>	a = b'h\xb4\x19\x01\x07\x08\x08\x06'  a[2]  etc
<isaac_rks>	web deve;lopment is confusing fark
<jim>	isaac_rks. seriously tho, maybe you could go back and consider why you would use sqlalchemy, and what it would mean to civest
<jim>	divest
<isaac_rks>	the advantage i can see is it converts things into the right datatype
<therealtbe>	yeryry:i have a huge array of these things tho
<isaac_rks>	but maybe the pain of using it exceeds the pain of just writing that stuff mysef
<jim>	so without it, you'd have to convert manually
<isaac_rks>	yeah
<yeryry>	i have no idea what you're trying to do, really...
<therealtbe>	i'm trying to figure out wtf this datatype is
<kirkmcdonald>	therealtbe: that appears to be a byte string.
<therealtbe>	ok that is what i thought.  how would you decode it and print the individual bytes?
<isaac_rks>	i'll try passing null to the model constructor when it hits ""...
<therealtbe>	when i try i just get garbage characters in my terminal
<kirkmcdonald>	therealtbe: specifically, that is the repr of a byte string.
<kirkmcdonald>	therealtbe: in which something like \x01 represents a byte with the value 1 in it.
<therealtbe>	kirkmcdonald:the manual says it represents bytes 0 thru 7.   bytes 0...3 are a long that is a timestamp
<kirkmcdonald>	therealtbe: and \xb4 is the value 0xb4, and so on.
<kirkmcdonald>	therealtbe: that string appears to be eight bytes long, yes.
<kirkmcdonald>	therealtbe: if the byte string represents numbers, then the struct module may be useful for interpreting it as such.
<flound1129>	does the python logging class store state somewhere?
<kirkmcdonald>	flound1129: sure. what kind of state are you wondering about?
<flound1129>	handlers, etc.
<kirkmcdonald>	flound1129: yes, that is stored somewhere.
<flound1129>	where?
<jim>	you'd have to be more specific about what you're looking for if you want more specific locations
<flound1129>	well i've got this script
<flound1129>	where i configure a logger
<flound1129>	and each time i run it, each log line gets duplicated an extra time
<flound1129>	i've read about 10 stack overflow questions about this and they all say that handlers are getting added multiple times
<flound1129>	but that's not the case with my script
<niggler>	is there a performance difference between "x=1;y=2" and "x,y=1,2"
<kirkmcdonald>	flound1129: logger objects have a .handlers attribute, which is a list. this isn't documented, so i wouldn't use it for actual code. but for debugging, have at it.
<jim>	and you want to know how and why the dups happen? you want to get rid of the dups?
<flound1129>	yes jim
<jim>	to both?
<flound1129>	are the logging objects saved to disk somehow?
<flound1129>	persisted somewhere?
<flound1129>	this makes no sense to me
<kirkmcdonald>	flound1129: well, print logging.root.handlers
<kirkmcdonald>	flound1129: and see how many there are, and what they are.
<kirkmcdonald>	flound1129: also see if you call basicconfig anywhere, etc.
<flound1129>	i haven't called basicconfig
<kirkmcdonald>	flound1129: well, what does this code do with logging?
<flound1129>	it logs messages to a file
<flound1129>	http://pastebin.com/ygpb3qgd
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/o66kxbil09vjiwfyilsj/ (repasted for flound1129)
<kirkmcdonald>	flound1129: what happens to the stderr of this process?
<flound1129>	so, if i change 'coinbase2.log' to 'coinbase.log' in that config
<flound1129>	each line now gets printed 5 times
<flound1129>	if i leave it as coinbase.log, each line gets printed once
<flound1129>	how is this possible?
<kirkmcdonald>	flound1129: precisely how is this process being run?
<jeffspeff>	i have a filename represented as a string. i'm getting this via email.message.get_filename(). how can i determine the extension of the file? i thought about just using a str.split, but the extension could be 2, 3, 4 or any number of characters.
<flound1129>	via mod_python
<kirkmcdonald>	flound1129: oh, well.
<flound1129>	if you mention mod_wsgi you lose a testicle
<isaac_rks>	mod_wsgi
<_habnabit>	flound1129, twisted.web and proxypass
<kirkmcdonald>	flound1129: this behavior you are observing suggests your code is being executed more than once.
<flound1129>	it's not, though.
<kirkmcdonald>	flound1129: it's mod_python. it will do whatever it pleases.
<flound1129>	yes, but i know for a fact it's not being executed more than once.
<_habnabit>	niggler, no, but the latter is usually more readable
<flound1129>	there is output that would change if that was the fack
<flound1129>	*fact
<_habnabit>	niggler, using ; is rarely a good idea
<niggler>	and i remember older versions of python having issues with string concatenation, is 2.7 better in that regard?
<kirkmcdonald>	flound1129: and yet.
<yeryry>	that may in place of a newline?
<_habnabit>	niggler, depends on what you mean
<kirkmcdonald>	flound1129: you've got other output which suggests it *is* doing that.
<_habnabit>	niggler, i'd still recommend using str.join always anyway
<niggler>	a = "foo"; a+= "bar" + "baz"
<flound1129>	no, i have output suggesting it's logging lines more than once
<flound1129>	depending on the filename in the logging config
<kirkmcdonald>	flound1129: i suspect this is independent of the filename as such.
<flound1129>	why would it log lines once if i configure it with one filename and five times if i configure it with a different filename
<flound1129>	well, i agree that it should be.
<_habnabit>	flound1129, http://sscce.org/
<ldlework>	is there anything wrong with calling super(c, self).__init__ from a method on c other than __init__?
<kirkmcdonald>	ldlework: i wouldn't say that it's "wrong," but it is weird as hell.
<_habnabit>	codetaku, many things
<_habnabit>	codetaku, the most obvious of which are: true, false, null
<codetaku>	ah, i wasn't aware of those
<darkelement>	hey guys how can i loop through a text file by index? i understandhow to do it normally, but it would be a lot easier if i could do it this way, like how you can do range(len(array))
<dawiisss>	codetaku: thanks for your answer however when i do that it gives me nameerror: name 'self' is not defined
<igenius>	codetaku, i know they should be in the dataset, because i did not thing remove the first line
<igenius>	and yet, they're not there -- this is baffling
<codetaku>	igenius: are you actually certain that the headers are not included in the dict?  dicts are not ordered, so the records you see are pulled out in whatever order, it might be somewhere in there
<igenius>	i did nothing to remove them*
<igenius>	yeah i'm sure
<moshez>	darkelement: list(fp) would give you a list of the lines. is that what you want?
<_habnabit>	darkelement, `for line in yourfile:`
<codetaku>	dawiisss: you need to set 'self' as the first parameter to your functions
<igenius>	yes i know the order is different now, i noticed that
<monkeyseer>	darkelement: if you just want the line number, you can use enumerate
<_habnabit>	darkelement, doing `range(len(whatever))` is almost always a mistake
<codetaku>	igenius: can you paste the code you have now?
<igenius>	i search json file and i search the printed out list
<darkelement>	moshez: yea, that'll work fine
<igenius>	i can't find asin" nor seller-sku"
<codetaku>	i'm curious how that might be igenius, but i'd have to see the code to tell
<monkeyseer>	darkelement: just note that you will read the entire file into memory
<monkeyseer>	if that's what you need
<darkelement>	monkeyseer: it's not the most efficient, but i suppose it will work.
<darkelement>	only have to do it once after all
<dawiisss>	codetaku: i did that now when i try to call the function from another python file it gives me the typeerror: run() missing 1 required positional argument: 'self'   so what would i set the self as ??
<igenius>	oh wait there is something anomolous
<igenius>	seller-sku appears to have been translated as an entry of "1"
<igenius>	i don't know why that could be though
<igenius>	"asin" was actually there, it's just that the first time i looked for it i typed "asins" instead
<codetaku>	dawiisss: in order to construct an insance of a class, you use the class name so you would have something like 'test = signup()', then you call its functions with test.run() and self will automatically be provided
<vgr>	dawiisss: `self` is the class instance, which would be implicitely added if you called the method from an instance (and not from the class)
<igenius>	there is an entry which says "asin : 1"
<vgr>	what codetaku said
<igenius>	omfg sorry codetaku
<codetaku>	dawiisss: you can declare class-level data and functions, but you usually don't want/need to
<igenius>	i see my problem now
<vgr>	dawiisss: also, you most likely don't need globals
<dawiisss>	codetaku: aa ok i see now
<vgr>	(there are few cases where you actually need the `global` keyword. this is not one of those)
<dawiisss>	vgr: i realised that :)
<codetaku>	dawiisss: i am going to modify the code you pasted to show you a few things, give me a minute
<vgr>	:)
<dawiisss>	codetaku: ok thanks
<projectrevotpp>	what about gevent?
<_habnabit>	projectrevotpp, gevent is pretty crappy. i recommend twisted instead
<projectrevotpp>	well i found out its what tpp streamer uses for.. some reason
<lnemo>	projectrevotpp: it's python3 compatible, whereas twisted isn't.  maybe they wanted forward compatibility
<_habnabit>	lnemo, haha what? gevent doesn't support python 3, but twisted does
<projectrevotpp>	well tpp streamer said gevent is more readable code, why would it be that way and not the other way around?
<igenius>	codetaku, now that i'm reading from the json file, is the structure i'm getting back also still a dictionary?
<lnemo>	_habnabit: my bad, went back to my source and i'm wrong
<lnemo>	thanks for correcting me :)
<_habnabit>	projectrevotpp, some people think that gevent is more readable because it doesn't have explicit indication of where context switches happen, but it turns out that this makes code /less/ readable because you can't look at a function and tell if it it can context-switch out from under you
<_habnabit>	projectrevotpp, as a result, your code requires explicit locking, so it's no better than using threads
<igenius>	codetaku , all my strings in my dict have "u" in front of them now
<vgr>	igenius: since you're new to python, i would suggest going with python 3 rather than python 2, for *exactly* that reason
<yvear>	asyncio will *eventually* replace twisted right?
<_habnabit>	yvear, they're not really comparable
<_habnabit>	yvear, twisted has a suite of protocol implementations
<igenius>	i see, point well taken, but unfortunately the mws code is not ported to python3 yet. maybe i will make a new open source project to convert mws.py to python3 though
<vgr>	igenius: nedbat made a great article on the matter: http://nedbatchelder.com/text/unipain.html
<_habnabit>	vgr, 'all my strings have "b" in front of them now'
<projectrevotpp>	"factories and camelcase and the sign of a mind warped by too much java programming"
<igenius>	what does the u and b mean
<greedo>	byte
<projectrevotpp>	java will do that to you?
<vgr>	_habnabit: fun bedtime stories
<projectrevotpp>	i used to code in java in high school
<projectrevotpp>	horror stories
<igenius>	so python2 interprets things as unicode instead of utf-8 by default?
<vgr>	read the article, it's relevant
<_habnabit>	projectrevotpp, saying that twisted is bad because 'factories and camelcase' is like saying python is bad because it uses whitespace for lexical scoping: it's entirely missing the point
<_habnabit>	projectrevotpp, it's a last resort of lazy complainers
<igenius>	i watched his video already actually
<projectrevotpp>	isnt a programmer by definition lazy? creating code so he doesnt have to do as much work as possible?
<projectrevotpp>	i mean, in a weird way
<sange>	if you look at it that way, sure.
<_habnabit>	projectrevotpp, this is a different kind of lazy
<_habnabit>	projectrevotpp, you're talking about the virtue of being lazy
<vgr>	projectrevotpp: i am lazy. i'm coding so i can stop being lazy
<_habnabit>	projectrevotpp, i'm talking about lazy as a vice
<sange>	i'm coding so people can be lazy.
<vgr>	aren't we all
<greedo>	igenius: python 3 essentially removed the byte-string type which in 2.x was called str
<_habnabit>	greedo, it was renamed, not removed
<greedo>	ok, if you want to call it that
<igenius>	so now everything is just a bytestream
<igenius>	great....
<vgr>	no
<vgr>	it was
<vgr>	now it's unicode by default
<igenius>	that's what i thought
<vgr>	python 3's major improvement over python 2 is its unicode support
<igenius>	my only confusion is what it is in pyton2
<_habnabit>	'by default' only insofar as an undecorated string literal is unicode
<codetaku>	dawiisss: the code is far from perfect, but i have made some changes and pointed the way to changes you should make... keep in mind i don't know jack about tkinter, and there are better ways to do what you're doing, i just improved what was there rather than rewriting from scratch:  https://bpaste.net/show/78ac583cc524
<vgr>	there are others of course, but that's the biggest one
<_habnabit>	greedo, saying it was removed is patently false, considering that all the pybytes_* c api functions (in cpython) still exist and do the same thing
<igenius>	yeah i think i said it backwards, but i realized last week after reading nedbat's article that python3 was using native unicode
<igenius>	what i didn't understand was what python2's native default is
<igenius>	if that makes any sense whatsoever
<igenius>	please don't say undecorated because that makes me think you're talking about decorators
<codetaku>	roughly speaking, py2 used ascii with unicode being the special case, and py3 uses unicode... which is pretty much the only sane default now.  over 80% of the web is utf-8
<_habnabit>	igenius, 'unprefixed'?
<igenius>	are you sure it wasn't utf-8 with unicode being the special case?
<codetaku>	utf-8 is an encoding of unicode
<greedo>	from a purely theoretical point of view text always in unicode sounds awesome imo
<igenius>	_habnabit, how about "unflowered"
<altrex>	hi. how do you square root and why is there no operator for this
<yvear>	i haven't maintained a large project before, but i feel like if the test suite is solid then going from py2 to py3 would be not that bad
<sange>	from math import sqrt ?
<igenius>	from math import *
<codetaku>	dawiisss: take a look at the code and please ask any questions you have, i made some pretty fundamental changes and want to be sure you understand why i did them
<_habnabit>	igenius, no, never 'import *'
<sange>	never import *
<igenius>	math.sqrt(numvalue)
<vgr>	igenius: no
<dawiisss>	codetaku: yeah thanks for that i am looking through the code right now
<greedo>	however in real life it start breaking down
<igenius>	never do that?
<_habnabit>	igenius, never
<igenius>	not even for the lowly math lib?
<vgr>	igenius: just because something is good in c doesn't mean it's good in python
<vgr>	c is made so you import the contents of a header. in python you import a module/package and access it
<igenius>	altrex, sorry, just import what you need from the math lib
<vgr>	just `import math`
<igenius>	and altrex, there isn't an operator but there is a function for square root
<altrex>	ok so math.sqrt() is no?
<vgr>	altrex: no, it's fine
<greedo>	_habnabit: perhaps in the strictest technical sense sure
<vgr>	it's just igenius giving bad advice
<sange>	altrex: that works, as long as you import it before.
<_habnabit>	greedo, i'm not sure how you could possibly interpret what python 3 did as 'removing' the old type
<alexwall>	o/
<igenius>	altrex lemme know if you need help
<codetaku>	igenius: if you've not read it before, you might like to read pep-8 which recommends various conventions such as naming classes/functions/variables/etc and how to organize your imports
<igenius>	i'll convert your matlab scripts over to pythong
<vgr>	igenius: if someone needs help they'll ask
<altrex>	i need to do sqrt ( 34*x^2 + 68*x - 510 ) and you guys are really positive thanks
<alexwall>	so i want to run a http server but when i type python -m http.server in the directory of the server nothing happens
<igenius>	i still don't even understand how imports work, that's the funny part. i've gotten this far without even understanding basic stuff like that fully
<vgr>	altrex: you would need to use ** instead of ^
<vgr>	^ is a bitwise xor operator, ** is the actual exponential operator
<alexwall>	what am i doing wrong
<vgr>	igenius: maybe reading docs.python.org would be a good idea
<igenius>	so codetaku, what do i do about all those little 'u' in front of my dictionary entries
<vgr>	if you don't understand how importing works, i doubt you can even grasp how much of python works
<codetaku>	igenius: ignore them?
<igenius>	are they something to be concerned about (ie, do i need to convert everything back to ascii?)
<igenius>	well they don't seem to be causing trouble
<codetaku>	not unless you are sending them somewhere that needs ascii
<codetaku>	the convention is to store everything in unicode and if you need ascii only convert it immediately before sending it off to where its going
<codetaku>	by unicode i mean encoded as utf-8
<vgr>	which you would already knew if you read nedbat's post i linked you
<vgr>	(which you didn't)
<igenius>	i'm assuming the amazon api needs ascii haha
<vgr>	s/knew/know/ too
<codetaku>	igenius: i would be very surprised if it did
<igenius>	i didn't read nedbat's post, i *watched* it and his comedic nature distracted me from the actual content
<igenius>	but i still learned a whole lot. just need to watch it twice
<vgr>	that's why you read
<moonlightning>	codetaku: doesn't python store strings internally as something closer to pure unicode than utf-8?
<_habnabit>	'pure unicode' isn't a thing
<greedo>	*sigh* _habnabit maybe a more correct statement would be support for non unicode data text was removed in py 3.x
<_habnabit>	unicode is not an encoding
<codetaku>	moonlightning: unicode doesn't specify any binary format
<igenius>	wait a sec, isn't ascii a subset of unicode
<vgr>	greedo: that is also wrong
<codetaku>	igenius: it is a subset of utf-8
<_habnabit>	igenius, ascii-the-character-set is a subset of unicode-the-character-set
<vgr>	greedo: there is bytes
<greedo>	how would you phrase it then vgr?
<vgr>	they were renamed
<greedo>	ok renamed
<igenius>	and utf-8 is a subset of unicode, ergo ascii is a subset of unicode
<vgr>	str -> bytes; unicode -> str
<_habnabit>	greedo, python 2 has strings of bytes and strings of unicode code points
<vgr>	igenius: wrong
<greedo>	is everyone happy now
<_habnabit>	greedo, python 3 has strings of bytes and strings of unicode code points
<moonlightning>	igenius: utf-8 is an encoding for unicode.
<shlant>	can someone help me fix this probably simple syntax error? https://gist.github.com/mrmmorris/0f3ac5059dfe0cf794d5
<igenius>	oh an encoding....so not a subset. now i see
<igenius>	time to go read that nedbat blog
<codetaku>	igenius: no, utf-8 is an encoding of unicode.  unicode is a list of code points, how to store those code points or transfer them is undefined.  an encoding defines that, and utf-8 is the most common one (by a mile)
<vgr>	shlant: so you do know that you have a single string, right?
<_habnabit>	shlant, do you understand why this is a syntax error?
<igenius>	do you mean a hashtable lookup ?
<igenius>	utf-8 is a different hashing relationship to unicode data
<greedo>	semantics, anyways
<_habnabit>	greedo, it's not semantics
<codetaku>	and each code point is not a 'character' i should mention... code points can be things like 'switch to bidirectional text mode', 'superscript next character', etc
<greedo>	it is to me
<igenius>	like how the bytes are mapped to characters
<shlant>	_habnabit: i assume it's because i can't add the variable to the string in this context
<moonlightning>	codetaku: those aren't characters?
<moonlightning>	i mean, they're not /glyphs/, but…
<shlant>	_habnabit: or i have to put it at the end?
<vgr>	shlant: first, yes, put it after the closing paren
<shlant>	vgr: awesome, thanks
<vgr>	shlant: second, do you want one or 5 strings? you have one right now
<dawiisss>	codetaku: i have a question where you defined a create_frame you put the entry and stuff as frm9frame , frm8frame etc etc why not just use frame? as fun sets the frame anyway??
<shlant>	one
<codetaku>	moonlightning: i don't know what 'character' means if it encompasses abstract format details separately...
<moonlightning>	okay, how /does/ cpython 3 handle `str`ings internally?
<_habnabit>	greedo, ok let me rephrase this slightly
<shlant>	vgr: i think one. i am creating a file with that as the content
<dawiisss>	func*
<shlant>	with open(save_path, 'w') as f:
<shlant>	            f.write(config)
<_habnabit>	greedo, python 2 has strings of bytes (str) and strings of unicode code points (unicode). python 3 has strings of bytes (bytes) and strings of unicode code points (str)
<vgr>	alrighty then
<codetaku>	dawiisss: you mean where i pass frmframe[0] to the call to self.create_login_frame() ?
<moonlightning>	codetaku: /codepoint/ is a better term, i guess.
<greedo>	that works for me _habnabit
<dawiisss>	codetaku: no i mean this :https://bpaste.net/show/114da95caed8
<codetaku>	dawiisss: ahh, that was a mistake, i should have replaced that with 'frame'
<codetaku>	frm9frame no longer exists, of course
<dawiisss>	codetaku: ok :)
<igenius>	do you think python 2 will ever get the unicode update so ppl don't have switch to python 3
<codetaku>	no problem, it's good that you caught it, it shows that you're understanding the code
<alexwall>	any help?
<projectrevotpp>	well for whatever reason i'd like to install gevent and see just how bad it is, can anybody tell me why i got "failed to import set_exc_info: dll load failed, %1 is not a valid win32 application"?
<projectrevotpp>	is it because of gevent?
<_habnabit>	igenius, well, it depends on what you mean by 'the unicode update'
<_habnabit>	igenius, python 2 already has `from __future__ import unicode_literals`
<igenius>	oh ok...gotcha
<codetaku>	python 2 can deal with unicode just fine... it's just a bigger pain in the ass than with python 3 where it's "automatic"
<_habnabit>	not really true; python 3 just likes to pretend that lots of data is text, so more strings you get from external sources are exposed as unicode strings
<dawiisss>	codetaku: at the end when you talk about app.destroy() but what i want to do is bascially close the whole class after that signuppress function is done
<igenius>	automatic versus semiautomatic
<codetaku>	dawiisss: what do you mean by 'clone'?
<codetaku>	dawiisss: you want to make a class for a different window maybe?
<dawiisss>	codetaku: yes i have another class which is the main class then i have a new file with this class and i call it so once i press that signup button i want the whole signup class to close so isn't app.destroy() the way to go?
<igenius>	i should pastebin up some of my matlab scripts that i've been trying to convert to python so that guys like _habnabit and nedbat can actually challenge themselves
<igenius>	it seems like you guys are not challenged at all
<codetaku>	dawiisss: you should have a 'main' function, and it should create the signup object, then call "run"... although it shouldn't be called 'run', it should really be called something like 'show_window', and then the main function should do app.mainloop() ... ooh, and the 'app = tk()' call should be put in main too
<alexwall>	so i want to run a http server but when i type python -m http.server 8000 in the directory of the server it says module not found, where do i get the http.server module?
<_habnabit>	alexwall, python 2?
<alexwall>	27
<codetaku>	dawiisss: i am not familar with tkinter, but i believe the flow should be the main function calls app.eventloop() and app.destroy is not called until the entire program is being ended
<_habnabit>	alexwall, 2.7?
<alexwall>	so yes?
<alexwall>	yeah
<_habnabit>	alexwall, twistd -n web --path=.
<alexwall>	what?
<dawiisss>	codetaku: ok the problem with tkinter is that if you call app = tk() and app.mainloop inside of the main function then it won't work as it will create the window as soon as the file is imported in the main class
<alexwall>	it says no option -n
<_habnabit>	alexwall, that'll run a python http server on port 8080
<codetaku>	dawiisss: have you gotten it to the point where you have seen the window get displayed?  i'm not sure 11 300x350 frames is really going to work... or does .pack() shrink them to the size they need to be?
<alexwall>	_habnabit, what do i need to type in to cmd? python twistd -n web --path=.
<alexwall>	?
<_habnabit>	alexwall, oh, windows?
<alexwall>	yeah >_>
<dawiisss>	codetaku: yeah the code works perfectly but the issue is with the signuppress function
<codetaku>	dawiisss: it won't do that any more, previously it did that because you had 'app = tk()' in a class-level function
<dawiisss>	codetaku: thats what i thought however there is still typeerror: signuppress() missing 1 required positional argument: 'self'
<dawiisss>	codetaku: once i press that button
<alexwall>	_habnabit, so what do i do?
<codetaku>	hmm, did you add a call to it?  it should only ever be called by tk itself as the event handler for the click
<igenius>	are unicode "characters" always described by 4 bytes?
<dawiisss>	codetaku: so i press signup button and basically thats what happens
<projectrevotpp>	sorry i disconnected
<codetaku>	igenius: no, utf-16 encoding uses 4 bytes always, utf-8 is variable width (and quite clever)
<codetaku>	dawiisss: can you paste your current code for me?
<projectrevotpp>	"failed to import set_exc_info: dll load failed, %1 is not a valid win32 application"?
<offby1>	there's a fine line between "clever" ...
<_habnabit>	alexwall, is it 2.7.9?
<alexwall>	how to get version
<dawiisss>	codetaku: here you go https://bpaste.net/show/2c6cccf71317
<_habnabit>	alexwall, start up the repl
<codetaku>	doh, wait, utf-16 is 2 bytes, not 4, whoops
<kadoban>	codetaku: err. utf-16 is 2 byte code units … also it's variable length, like utf-8
<alexwall>	oh god what
<_habnabit>	codetaku, utf-16 is 2-bytes or 4-bytes
<igenius>	hahaha
<wild_cat>	yeah, ucs-2 is the fixed-witdth 2-byte one
<kadoban>	right
<codetaku>	oh, wow, i had no idea utf-16 was variable width
<igenius>	4 nybles
<codetaku>	sorry about that
<_habnabit>	utf-16 used to be just 2-bytes, before code points went up to 24-bit values
<alexwall>	_habnabit, 2.7.8
<_habnabit>	alexwall, ah, okay
<codetaku>	dawiisss: the problem is with your 'create_signup_frame' function, it sets signup.signuppress as the event handler, you need self.signuppress since it is not a class-level function... also, you shouldn't need that function at all, create_signup_button does the same thing (and correctly)
<codetaku>	dawiisss: run has to be called on something (if you make it an instance function), and by something
<jawny>	codetaku: is it the book by prentice hall? i think i already have it on my computer saved somewhere
<dawiisss>	codetaku: ok thanks for everything i will look into it later now i am going to bed
<monkeyseer>	what are some good pycon videos in general
<monkeyseer>	i loved the class development toolkit one
<codetaku>	dawiisss: no prooblem, i hope i was able to help somewhat
<fwef>	is csv's writerow() thread-safe?
<codetaku>	grr, my keyboard, which i dearly love, has something wrong with its o key... sometimes it will miss a keypress, soometimes it will double them (see?)... either that or i have a brain tumor which is screwing with fine motor control
<kadoban>	or it could be both </pesimism to the rescue>
<codetaku>	haha, thanks for opening my mind kadoban i hadn't considered that possibility!
<kadoban>	;)
<cyphase>	monkeyseer, there are lots of good videos on pyvideo.org. i like raymond hettinger's talks, for one
<monkeyseer>	cool, let me look it up
<codetaku>	although i guess if its a tumor it'd be a weird one, only screwing up my hitting of the o key and no others
<kepler>	nedbat, still here??!
<igenius>	yo kepler, he's watching the big fight
<kepler>	:o
<kepler>	he had an idea about something i was working on before. don't have the scroll back set long enough to see it
<igenius>	<nedbat>kepler: soounds like you want a loop that keep a current object, and decides whether to add to the object, or make a new one, based on the leading space
<kepler>	yes!
<kepler>	i can't do that
<igenius>	no?
<kepler>	not saying python can't. just me
<igenius>	looking for an alternate sol'n?
<kepler>	or why im wrong
<codetaku>	kepler: show me some code
<igenius>	let us help you kepler. codetaku will be the main and i'll be the wing
<kepler>	sounds good
<kepler>	http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=n4xpacny
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/zpor2ah2s1vroqpylaor/ (repasted for kepler)
<codetaku>	kepler: you have both the if and elif checking for startswith(' ')
<kepler>	so i have a config file. anything that doesn't start with a space is like a heading...everything that has a space under it is part of that first thing's config
<kepler>	one is not start, the other is start
<kepler>	first is "if not line.startswith"
<codetaku>	i'd recommend using a dictionary, a defaultdict in fact
<kepler>	ok, i tried that
<kepler>	but it said i couldn't put strings in for the list indecencies
<kepler>	so i was doing something wrong
<kepler>	the config file would be like this:
<kepler>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/jjobzk3za5y32c9yvimw/
<igenius>	kepler, what style of configuration file is it?
<kepler>	cisco
<igenius>	never seen that before
<kepler>	so "interface potato" should contain everything after it that has a space at the start...then when i get to interface apple, it should make a new object or whatever, and add those next 2 lines
<codetaku>	kepler: http://paste.pound-python.org/show/kofxugd8e6kxy9fwb5jr/
<codetaku>	the indentation on that paste isn't right, and you probable want to use network_object rather than configobj but you get the idea
<codetaku>	oh, and you'll need to add 'from collections import defaultdict' up with your imports
<kepler>	yeah, i did configobj = collections.defaultdict(list)
<codetaku>	that works too
<igenius>	are you just trying to parse the file and figure out which are headers and which are children
<kepler>	more or less
<igenius>	i was trying to do the opposite of this before for an xml file
<igenius>	taking the structure of an xml file and displaying it so that all the children were tabbed relative to their parents
<kepler>	codetaku, that looks like it worked!
<codetaku>	congrats!
<codetaku>	defaultdicts coming in handy tonight
<codetaku>	and i rarely use them in my own projects oddly enough
<kepler>	i was doing defaultdict before i asked in here again, and was close. i see what i did wrong now
<kepler>	so now i should be able to search the configobj to find whatever info i want
<igenius>	you seriously don't use them much? they seem super useful
<igenius>	godlike almost
<igenius>	they are part of the "high performance container datatypes" collection, who wouldn't want that
<igenius>	so codetaku....you seem like you learned python quite recently based your github
<igenius>	it seems like you learned all that you know within a couple years
<codetaku>	i use dicts all the time, just no need for defaultdicts in most cases... of course i'm usually defining my own configs and data so i know which fields it'll have... or i just do it dynamic
<igenius>	i still don't even get what a defaultdict does over a dict
<monkeyseer>	so, about that unicode in python 2.7...
<jim>	i need to run a python line n times where n is a var containing an int
<codetaku>	igenius: well, i've been a developer for.... 27 years?  picking up another language when you have worked with a bunch of others doesn't take too long
<monkeyseer>	does anyone know how to filter "unprintable" characters from a unicode string? :)
<igenius>	oh holy crap
<codetaku>	igenius: if the key doesn't exist in the dict and you reference it, it creates it with that default value
<igenius>	oh like if i say "mydict['shamu'], it will give me an empty list
<codetaku>	otherwise you would have gotten keyerror exceptions in your project when it encounters an asin not already in the dict
<codetaku>	yeah, instead of throwing an exception
<igenius>	now i get it
<igenius>	thanks man, you rocked out on my code. now i feel uber confident to proceed
<codetaku>	monkeyseer: import the 'string' module and strip out anything not present in string.ascii_printable (i think that's it)
<monkeyseer>	i was wondering if there's a way to strip unprintable unicode characters
<codetaku>	or do you mean like unprintable in unicode?
<monkeyseer>	yeah, that
<codetaku>	ah, like a diacritic without a cdoe point to alter?  hmmm, never tried to do that
<_habnabit>	monkeyseer, what do you define as unprintable, and why do you want to get rid of them?
<monkeyseer>	i guess for most purposes, stripping out ascii unprintable is fine
<igenius>	he probably is setting up for a thermal printer project
<monkeyseer>	i'm writing an irc bot
<monkeyseer>	so i sort of have to deal with unicode
<igenius>	oh sweet, gotcha
<monkeyseer>	so fun in python 2
<codetaku>	monkeyseer: you might be able to use unicodedata.category and filter based on the category
<monkeyseer>	ok
<_habnabit>	monkeyseer, so where are you getting unprintable characters from?
<natkite>	i installed python and pypy and then uninstalled pypy. now bash points to pypy as interpreter for pip. what should i do?
<monkeyseer>	from pluggable scripts
<codetaku>	_habnabit: is there a term for something like a unicode modifier code point by itself?
<_habnabit>	codetaku, a combining character?
<_habnabit>	monkeyseer, not sure what you mean by that
<jim>	look at the file which is pip
<_habnabit>	monkeyseer, maybe if you gave an example
<monkeyseer>	my bot run certain scripts
<natkite>	jim : what do you mean?
<monkeyseer>	for instance, one of the commands pulls stuff from a webpage and sends a public message
<codetaku>	yeah, but i mean a combining character with nothing to combine it with... that would be my guess for a meaning of 'unprintable' but i was woondering if there was a specific term for an orphaned one like that to express its un-renderability
<monkeyseer>	if i send something illegal, the server will probably disconnect me
<jim>	the top line will have a #!
<_habnabit>	monkeyseer, what on a webpage is unprintable...?
<jim>	look at it, to start with
<monkeyseer>	dunno
<monkeyseer>	if i make an http request, the website can give me anything
<monkeyseer>	anyhow, other scripts can do more ridiculous things
<jim>	i need to run a python line n times where n is a var containing an int... a while loop with a decrementing index?
<monkeyseer>	i guess you can assume an irc user can make my script attempt to send any message
<monkeyseer>	i can limit the length, although i would also like to filter out illegal characters too
<_habnabit>	monkeyseer, https://github.com/habnabit/theresa-bot/blob/master/theresa.py#l31-l35
<monkeyseer>	> # dang why doesn't this exist anywhere already
<monkeyseer>	i wonder why
<codetaku>	jim: for i in range(n, 0, -1)   oor for i in reversed(range(n))
<gsnedders>	codetaku, monkeyseer: if you unprintable, you probably want category c*
<gsnedders>	which are control characters
<monkeyseer>	ok, i'll look at that
<codetaku>	ah, that will be handy to know, thanks gsnedders
<gsnedders>	(so unicodedata.category(x)[0] == "c")
<jim>	that works fine
<natkite>	pip
<gsnedders>	combining characters are some other category (m*?), but you'd only care about them if they occur before any character they can combine with, and that gets quite complex
<codetaku>	one thing i've always wondered about unicode:  how do fonts deal with the necessity to define such a titanic number of glyphs?  is there a single 'reference' font which includes glyphs for every single one?  are there multiple such fonts, or are most specific to a locales charset?
<gsnedders>	codetaku: in most systems, in most cases, if the current font doesn't contain a glyph you fallback to a font that does contain it, or to some placeholder if no font does
<gsnedders>	codetaku: how many glyphs a given font contains depends on a lot!
<igenius>	did you write theresa bot?
<codetaku>	but does at least one 'reference' complete font exist?  if so, vector or raster?
<natkite>	jim : after editing out the interpreter to python and not pypy it gives me a distributionnotfound error
<natkite>	how do i completely purge/remove every pip installation and easy_install and start afresh ?
<gsnedders>	codetaku: not to my knowledge; there's a "representative glyph" for each encoded character in the code charts, but that's about it
<codetaku>	gsnedders: i guess if they compiled those glyphs into one file it would be too large to be practically useful anyway
<gsnedders>	codetaku: i mean there are fonts that cover a /lot/, and the gnu unifont comes to mind, but the only reference is what appears in the code charts, there's no font per say
<gsnedders>	*per se
<gsnedders>	codetaku: anyhow, this is quite off-topic :)
<projectrevotpp>	this might seem silly again but http://pastebin.com/fxdq6thn i cant seem to send anything over the 7001 port.
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/qca9kagc0bx5ikvmjjfu/ (repasted for projectrevotpp)
<projectrevotpp>	info, thats outdated
<codetaku>	is there a python module which will let you test if the active terminal can display a glyph for a normalized codepoint?  i can test if the terminal supports utf-8, but don't see a way to check if it can display a specific codepoint
<_habnabit>	projectrevotpp, there's no 7001 port here
<kepler>	codetaku, is there a way to add it to the dictionary only if it doesn't exist?
<_habnabit>	kepler, dict.setdefaul?
<projectrevotpp>	in the code, the def send() function
<_habnabit>	kepler, dict.setdefault?
<kepler>	yeah
<projectrevotpp>	line 25
<_habnabit>	projectrevotpp, oh, you edited your pastebin
<projectrevotpp>	its a mess right now
<projectrevotpp>	in the process of restructuring
<_habnabit>	projectrevotpp, please use bpaste.net instead of pastebin.com
<projectrevotpp>	k
<projectrevotpp>	anyway i was trying to have a script both listen on port 7000 and send on 7001 (to somewhere else)
<projectrevotpp>	and while i receive data just fine sending doesn't reach the external program
<codetaku>	kepler: well, you could use something like 'if element not in dict:', but i'm not sure if there is a one-liner which i imagine is what you're asking
<kepler>	im typing out the if stuff now
<kepler>	after that else you put, adding an "if object name is not in configobj:" add it
<codetaku>	do you need to do that though?
<kepler>	yeah. so im looping through a few hundred config files
<kepler>	every time it finds an instance of the object, it adds another set of the information for each file to the dictionary
<codetaku>	the only situation where you could encounter an option without the key having been added would be if a setting starting with a space existed before the first non-spaced line
<kepler>	mmmm, so there are 300 config files. every one of those files has "potato", and every potato has lines under it. so the first iteration it has 5 lines like normal. the second, it has 10 lines, 3rd, 15...cause each config file has the set of data
<codetaku>	ah, so you end up with very long lists... if there will never be a duplicate entry in those lists (and order is unimportant) you might want to consider making them sets rather than lists
<kepler>	yeah
<kepler>	mmmmm, so if it is a set, items won't duplicate?
<codetaku>	correct, sets cannot contain duplicates and trying to add one is a no-op
<kepler>	so how do i make each of those a set
<codetaku>	change your defaultdict(list) to defaultdict(set) and change your .append calls to .add
<kepler>	that easy, eh
<kepler>	set has no attribute "append"
<codetaku>	yup, and if you need those things to be a list later for some reason (like if you are serializing to json), you can easily convert them with list()
<kepler>	.add?
<codetaku>	that is what i said ;)
<kepler>	yay reading
<kepler>	that works out perfectly. wooooooooot
<kepler>	ty ty ty ty
<kepler>	now i need to get this crap into a db somehow with the same structure
<codetaku>	a specific type of db?
<kepler>	mysql or whatever would work
<codetaku>	redis?
<kepler>	i dont have any of that set up yet
<codetaku>	redis makes storing dicts (redis calls them hashes) and sets as easy as can be
<jim>	if i do multiple inheritance, how do i make sure all the __init__s get called?
<igenius>	you know, i still want to try redis instead of the json method
<_habnabit>	jim, super()
<codetaku>	jim: you might want to read up on 'mro', method resolution order... the order in which the functions will get called is probably not what you would guess it would be
<igenius>	codetaku - this kepler guy is giving me deja vu
<jim>	hopefully order doesn't matter
<codetaku>	igenius: if your data fits in memory, its quite nice... operations are usually measured in microseconds too
<codetaku>	igenius: i know, right?
<igenius>	so it's faster than json?
<codetaku>	i haven't tested it, but almost certainly not
<codetaku>	it's just not 'slow'
<jim>	a little more specific...
<_habnabit>	jim, read descrintro; it covers all of this
<kepler>	bahhh crap. so this is working exactly how we thought...but i have "interface bvi4", which is supposed to have different children on every config file...it puts everything it finds into every "interface bvi4" object. so it ends up having way more than it should.
<kepler>	i need another dict for each config file i guess
<kepler>	booo
<igenius>	don't fret kepler, it gets easier
<codetaku>	don't you need all of it though?  i mean, if it's different...
<jim>	if i do class d(b1, b2), i have reason to believe b2.__init__ isn't getting called (if it were, an instance variable defined in b2.__init__() would not be missing)
<_habnabit>	jim, does b1 call super() in its __init__?
<jim>	i don't think so
<_habnabit>	jim, ok, then there's no way for b2's __init__ to be called
<kepler>	yeah. so firewall_one has context_one, context_two, context_three. firewall_two has the same...but inside each context (config file) is an "interface bvi4". i need to separate the firewall_two, context_two bvi4 from the firewall_2, context_1 bvi4
<kepler>	as well as from firewall_one's
<jim>	confusing... but i'll give it a shot
<remram>	on debian, virtual envs don't pick up dist-packages?
<remram>	this looks like a critical bug
<_habnabit>	remram, did you create your virtualenv with --system-site-packages ?
<remram>	yes
<kepler>	i interchanged one and 1 in there. sorry
<igenius>	kepler, what do you need then?
<codetaku>	kepler: i'm not sure i entirely understand, but could you handle bvi4 separately?
<remram>	dist-packages is different from site-packages
<kepler>	the problem is that there are 500 contexts and 500 potential bvi4s, which need to be in their own group
<kepler>	because bvi4 on context_one is different from bvi4 on context_two. if i search for bvi4, i get every context's bvi4 config
<_habnabit>	remram, works4me
<codetaku>	kepler: how about special-casing and if the object_name is 'bvi4', you append or prepend the context name so you get context1bvi4, context2bvi4, etc?
<igenius>	it seems like you need a master dictionary or some master datastructure kepler
<projectrevotpp>	https://bpaste.net/show/0c6f221c7981 im probably doing something wrong here
<codetaku>	projectrevotpp: is an exception bring thrown in the try block in send()?
<_habnabit>	projectrevotpp, your try-except is masking the errors
<_habnabit>	projectrevotpp, you meant to have a try-finally anyway
<kepler>	igenius, yeah. the end game is to be able to have a website where people can type in an ip address, it will show which firewall it is on, which context it is in, and all the firewall rules for that ip (or its entire zone)
<jwad>	can anyone tell me why this isn't working? https://bpaste.net/show/e77aa424c416
<kepler>	i dont know much about databases, but i was going to have a separate table per firewall
<igenius>	oh i see so that was the plan all along
<igenius>	you just need rules for creating each config file
<_habnabit>	jwad, "isn't working"?
<jwad>	_habnabit, uhmm
<jwad>	_habnabit, raises a stopiteration error
<kepler>	well, i have every config. i just want to sort them and add them into a database in a way that they can be easily/efficiently accessed
<_habnabit>	jwad, ok, and what did you expect to happen?
<codetaku>	kepler: no, you wouldn't want separate tables... you'd have a table with the firewalls listed in it, then foreign keys in another table pointing to it
<kepler>	going to have to google that later
<cast>	supposing i'm wanting to find the smallest value in a dictionary, would min(d.values()) be the nicest way?[d[d[d[d[d[d[d[d[d[d[d[d[d[d[d[d[d[d[d[d[d[d
<jwad>	_habnabit, i expected the set to be updated constantly, and i expected to be yielded the minimum value (aside form the previously yielded one) every time next was called
<_habnabit>	cast, sure
<cast>	[sorry, locked my tmux session accidently with i think c-s]
<codetaku>	kepler: is the ip you will be searching on one of the settings you're loading from the config files?
<projectrevotpp>	something about only 1 is normally permitted
<_habnabit>	jwad, ok, so `sorted(self.aset)` takes the value of self.aset, puts it in a list, sorts that list, and returns it
<projectrevotpp>	this is bull, it needs to listen on 7000 and send on 7001
<kepler>	yeah
<jwad>	_habnabit, yes...
<kepler>	so if i said i want 10.0.0.5, that shows up in a nog. one of those nogs is one of the items in a set we just created
<_habnabit>	jwad, as in, it's only evaluated once, at the start of the loop. once you add items to your set, there's no way for it to know to re-sort the list
<kepler>	that nog then shows up in rules, and then i'd show those rules
<igenius>	you are dropping all these abbrevs on me kepler
<igenius>	acrynoyms or what
<kepler>	just think of it as a variable i guess. a nog contains a list of ips in the config file
<igenius>	network operate group?
<kepler>	network object group
<jim>	_habnabit, that seems to work
<peng>	cast: /73
<peng>	cast: ...oops, sorry :x
<jwad>	_habnabit, then why does this test perform as expected? https://bpaste.net/show/a880cf8b8480
<peng>	cast: what i almost said, but then tried to take back was, itervalues might be better if the dict is large.
<kepler>	nog1 on context_one may be different from nog1 on context_two though. so right now i'm populating all the ips in nog1 regardless of which config file they're in. i need some way to separate them based on which config file they are in
<codetaku>	kepler: it might be worth changing your data structures around so that instead of configsection->configvalue->ip you're going the other directioon... if that's the only way you're going to access it
<_habnabit>	jwad, ok, so, you're ignoring the loop variable 'i' in your loop
<kepler>	it is not the only way to access it
<_habnabit>	jwad, effectively that means that once you start calling next() on the iterator, it takes len(self.aset) and loops that many times
<kepler>	people should be able to search for the object name or an item in the object
<jwad>	_habnabit, ahh, the next test works because there happens to be the same amount of items?
<_habnabit>	jwad, in your example there, you're not changing the number of items in your set
<_habnabit>	jwad, right
<kepler>	or just see the entire config
<_habnabit>	jwad, try calling .remove without also calling .add
<igenius>	kepler, you should push all your config files into a master data list
<jwad>	_habnabit, hmmm... yes, i see...
<jwad>	_habnabit, i'll try solving that problem then.
<codetaku>	kepler: ok, nevermind then, it was just a thought to make the querying easier if you only needed data by ip
<igenius>	datastructure* i mean. and then make sure your datastructure is super tight (meaning no redundancy), and then push them back out again to create config files on the fly with strict rules
<_habnabit>	jwad, perhaps you want to make your loop `while self.aset:`
<jwad>	_habnabit, quick aside: why does this loop not work without sorted()?
<cast>	peng: yeah, that was part of my concern. on py3 that code would be memory efficient correct? its just under py2 it wouldn't be? i was pondering how to make it nice and memory efficient in py2 and 3 but didn't see a way
<peng>	cast: right.
<kepler>	right now, the config files are text files in /firewall/context_xx.cfg
<_habnabit>	jwad, if by 'not work' you mean 'it throws a runtimeerror', it's because sorted() makes a copy
<_habnabit>	jwad, you can't change the size of a set while iterating over it
<kepler>	so i have the firewall name and context name already, before i even start looking at the actual contents of the configs
<jwad>	_habnabit, haha sorry for the ignorant terminology. i'll work on that.
<kepler>	can i make a firewall dict that has more dicts per config file, that has a dict for the objects in the config file?
<kepler>	3x nested dicts?
<jwad>	_habnabit, is that just a pythonic rule?
<_habnabit>	jwad, 'pythonic rule'? you mean the iterating over sets thing?
<jwad>	_habnabit, yeah
<_habnabit>	jwad, with the current implementation of sets and set iterators, it's not possible to keep consistent state if the size of the set changes during iteration
<jwad>	_habnabit, any specific reason? reason that we are able to mutate lists while iterating but not sets, that is.
<_habnabit>	jwad, imo it should raise an exception for lists too
<jwad>	_habnabit, ah. why is that?
<_habnabit>	jwad, a lot of people get confused by what happens if you iterate over a list while removing items from it
<jwad>	_habnabit, your opinion, that is
<codetaku>	kepler: you could.  but i think a more direct mapping of your data would probably be easier too work with.  you have a bunch of firewalls, make them a list or set.  each firewall has a bunch of configs.  make that a list or set.  the configs have name->value properties, so make that a dict
<kepler>	how do i tie them all together?
<codetaku>	jwad: he is right... try it sometime, you'll be skipping items and going over the end of the list all over the place
<codetaku>	(depending on whether you're iterating over items or indices)
<codetaku>	kepler: the firewalls list would have lists of configs as its values, and the configs would have dicts as their values
<jwad>	codetaku, i have recently haha. very confusing. just wanted to know his thoughts.
<codetaku>	in most other languages i've used with iterators, it would be a fatal error to modify something you're iterating through, not sure why python permits it with lists other than it would be messy to catch
<_habnabit>	it's pretty easy to catch
<_habnabit>	you can do it the same way it's done with sets and dicts
<jwad>	_habnabit, so using the "while" is just a way of looping without binding the loop to the unchanging list?
<_habnabit>	yep
<jwad>	_habnabit, ah.
<jwad>	_habnabit, just out of curiosity, since you mentioned it earlier, how does python catch the error?
<jwad>	_habnabit, sorry for all the questions. interested student here.
<mish>	has anyone worked with google cloud dns?
<codetaku>	has anyone here tried python embedded in html on the clientside?  (i believe there is a project involving pypy compiled to asm.js?  and maybe other options?)
<amun_ra>	codetaku: watch pypy presentation from the latest pycon
<codetaku>	amun_ra: oh, excellent!  thank you for letting me know this video existed
<amun_ra>	codetaku: there were some projects metioned but my /dev/mem doesn not serve me well on that subject
<jwad>	amun_ra, link?
<codetaku>	here's a link jwad :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pibfofqdiai
<_habnabit>	jwad, it's entirely based on the length
<amun_ra>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pibfofqdiai
<codetaku>	whoa, what in the hell?  he ran pystone in pypy.js and it was faster than cpython natively
<codetaku>	that's insane
<meorge>	hi, is there a way to have python list all web pages in a site's path?
<codetaku>	meorge: the limitation there is that the web server will not allow you to just get a directory listing (in most cases)... plus, many web pages are just dynamically generated content and "in a sites path" doesn't reall ymake sense
<codetaku>	if there is a page listing a bunch of links, you can pull that and parse out the links, which is probably the best you're going to get
<meorge>	no, there are a bunch of xml files on a web site
<meorge>	i want to get a list of them
<meorge>	but there are no links to them
<meorge>	and they are not named 'normally'
<amun_ra>	meorge: please be more specific
<meorge>	i'm trying to get the xml files a mobile game uses
<meorge>	if i know the name of the level, i can see the xml file (they're named after the levels)
<kadoban>	unless you can find a pattern to them or ask the devs, you're probably out of luck.
<meorge>	but otherwise, i can't get them
<codetaku>	unless the web server is configured to give you directory listing access to the directory they are in (almost certainly not), you can't
<meorge>	ok
<codetaku>	how determined are you meorge?  you could probably crack open the games binary and find the names that way
<meorge>	they apparently function totally by xmls
<meorge>	i guess to prevent that
<meorge>	https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=site:https:%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fshadowpuzzle%2f
<meorge>	by doing this, i can see at least some of the files
<jennifer>	hi.
<jennifer>	i need help understanding code. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19897209/troubleshooting-typeerror-ord-expected-string-of-length-1-but-int-found http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19897209/troubleshooting-typeerror-ord-expected-string-of-length-1-but-int-found
<jennifer>	fuck, sorry. i pasted twice. i meant -  print( struct.calcsize("bbhhhd"))
<jennifer>	what does that line do?
<simpson>	jennifer: calculates the size of the given struct format.
<amun_ra>	jennifer: https://docs.python.org/2/library/struct.html
<jennifer>	but bbhhhd?
<jennifer>	what's that?
<simpson>	well, let's look at struct's docs.
<kadoban>	jennifer: it's a struct format :)
<amun_ra>	jennifer: look at the page
<jennifer>	oh.
<jennifer>	thank you!
<codetaku>	meorge: i take it this is an android app?  grab the apk, unzip it (pretty sure they're actually zip files), and poke around a bit with the 'strings' command
<simpson>	b is s8, h is u16, h is s16, and d is double.
<kepler>	codetaku, so i have it so i can list all the firewalls. also have it so i can list all the contexts per firewall. now i can't get it to add the config stuff to only the context it should be
<kepler>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/ebanvrtmoeuuqlrf7koh/
<meorge>	codetaku: there is an android version, but i can only get the ios version
<meorge>	it's called 'do not believe his lies'
<kepler>	so at the end, printing firewall[rd-core-1] shows all the contexts correctly. the bvi4 one though, shows all contexts of all firewalls' bvi4s
<codetaku>	cool name... i know nothing about ios apps unfortunately, though strings might still be able to find something for you, and there is likely an app to decompress the binary within the ios sdk
<kepler>	sorry for the mess of dir/file looping
<jennifer>	 request_code, request_type, checksum, packet_id, \ <-- what is this \ doing here again? next line without executing code yet?
<kepler>	codetaku, it also works correctly if i substitute any other firewall for rd-core-1.asa
<kepler>	just need to tie configobj to the context in firewall[]
<codetaku>	kepler: the innermost objects being sets makes things difficult
<jennifer>	is there a difference between, when using bit operators, 0xffff and 0xffff?
<kepler>	you mean configobj?
<codetaku>	jennifer: nope
<jennifer>	thank you.
<codetaku>	kepler: what i'd like to do is firewall[asa_dir][context_name] = configobj at the end
<jennifer>	# struct -- interpret strings as packed binary data what is "packed binary data?"
<kepler>	yeahhhh, i was trying to do that below with the prints and it wasn't working
<kepler>	i have no idea how to do that though
<gsnedders>	jennifer: they're the same number, and the operators then work on the number itself; how you write the number is irrelevnt, 0xffff, 0xffff, 0xffff, 65556 (iirc!) are all the same. if that makes it clearer.
<jennifer>	yeah i knew that.
<jennifer>	i just didn't know if capitalization made a difference somehow. maybe something i missed.
<codetaku>	jennifer: packed binary data is like if you have a 4-byte integer, then an 8-byte floating point number, and they are stored as 12 bytes packed in next to each other
<codetaku>	gsnedders: close... 65536
<jim>	what kind of capitalization? like, where?
<jennifer>	hm i see.
<gsnedders>	codetaku: bah, my memory is going
<jennifer>	like 0xfff and 0xfff.
<jennifer>	i meant that jim.
<jennifer>	i got it now.
<codetaku>	gsnedders: when i can't sleep i do powers of 2
<gsnedders>	codetaku: when i can't sleep… oh wait it's 8am now
<codetaku>	heh, it's 3am here, but i'm fading fast, got up early today cause i'm watching a friends dog
<jim>	oh, normally (like for filenames and variable identifiers) caps do matter, but for hex digits, they don't
<jennifer>	is there any other way to rewrite the entire code or any portion of the code in the link i posted? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19897209/troubleshooting-typeerror-ord-expected-string-of-length-1-but-int-found
<kepler>	3am here too! you were meant to fix my code
<jennifer>	especially the get_route() part?
<codetaku>	kepler: i'm in wv, where you at?
<kepler>	pgh
<kepler>	good old pittsburgh
<seylerius>	can i create raw strings in python?
<codetaku>	kepler: i will probably be moving to the pittsburgh area early next year
<seylerius>	with the normal raw-string syntax?
<kepler>	im sorry :(
<amun_ra>	;>
<kepler>	nah, it isn't so bad here
<codetaku>	jennifer: do you just want to get a traceroute?
<igenius>	yes seylerius
<seylerius>	awesome.
<jennifer>	codetaku, yes sure.
<igenius>	isn't it just r"string"
<seylerius>	igenius: that's the normal syntax.
<codetaku>	kepler: i have family and friends in the area, pgh down to around wheeling, i'm originally from just south of wheeling
<kepler>	so how do i get it to work like "print firewall[asa_dir][context_name]['interface bvi4']"
<codetaku>	jennifer: what about just using the system tracert tool and capturing its output?
<igenius>	oh ok
<miigotu>	hey, if i were planning to ditch cheetah, so that i could port 2to3, which templating framework would you guys recommend? i am considering jinja2, mako, and anything suggested...
<codetaku>	miigotu: i'd probably recommend jinja2 because it seems to be the most widely used (i might be wrong, that's just how it seems to me)
<jennifer>	if sys.platform == 'darwin': which other system platform are there?
<jennifer>	codetaku, i'm doing the same exercise as the person in se.
<miigotu>	i figured jinja2 would be the most actively developed and supported
<seylerius>	igenius: that's a negatory on raw strings.
<codetaku>	jennifer: posix for linux and other such systems
<gsnedders>	miigotu: i'd probably just go for jinja2, tbh, because it's generally pretty good
<codetaku>	jennifer: there's also a value for windows but i forget what it is
<igenius>	i don't know what i'm talking about anymore then
<codetaku>	jennifer: ah, ok, i thought perhaps you might need more than just using the system tool
<jennifer>	what about for os x? i am using that now.
<jim>	os x uses a bsd kernel
<jim>	so it
<codetaku>	are you asking what the traceroute command is?  i imagine it is 'traceroute'
<codetaku>	although i don't know if osx includes it... probably
<jim>	is probably posix too (altho the text file line endings are different)
<auscompgeek>	os x uses '\n' for newlines as well
<auscompgeek>	jim, pls.
<jennifer>	which one is darwin?
<jennifer>	i thought darwin is os x or something?
<codetaku>	darwin is osx
<auscompgeek>	darwin is the os x kernel, yeah
<jim>	auscompgeek, i thought it was different
<gsnedders>	auscompgeek: no, xnu is the kernel; darwin includes a fair bit of the userland too
<codetaku>	osx is posix-compliant though, isn't it?
<auscompgeek>	gsnedders: oh, til
<seylerius>	codetaku: mostly?
<gsnedders>	darwin is essentially an open-source cli os, which contains very few of the os x apis but is the basis of os x and ios
<miigotu>	darwin used to use /r, unix /n, windows /r/n
<gsnedders>	codetaku: yes, it's by far the most common posix compliant os nowadays
<gsnedders>	miigotu: darwin never used /r, mac os (i.e., classic) did
<codetaku>	is that comparing it to individual linux distros, or all distros combined?
<miigotu>	eh, mis-labeled... yes mac os.
<gsnedders>	codetaku: no linux distro is posix compliant, afaik
<codetaku>	what makes you say that gsnedders?
<jim>	so then is linux sys.platform not posix?
<gsnedders>	codetaku: there are plenty of places where userland deviates from posix to do something saner; strict posix compliance has never been a goal
<miigotu>	circa 1993: https://personal.opengroup.org/~ajosey/tr28-07-2003.txt
<gsnedders>	sure, linux, the bsds… they're all *mostly* posix compliant, but they're not quite.
<codetaku>	on my box, sys.platform == linux   (linux mint cinnamon x64)
<codetaku>	which is a surprise to me, i thought it was posix before i checked
<miigotu>	although, most linux tools have made a lot of changes in recent years to become posix compliant ^
<jennifer>	syntaxerror: non-ascii character '\xe2' in file icmp.py on line 74, but no encoding declared
<jennifer>	what is this?
<usddddd>	they're pretty close just not certified
<usddddd>	but they do tend towards posix in most distros
<codetaku>	jennifer: you have a non-ascii character in your source (â) and haven't set the encoding of your source
<miigotu>	jennifer: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/
<gsnedders>	hell, ms sfu made windows nt posix compliant.
<jennifer>	:( damn this type of error gets me.
<isaac_rks>	what is the point of using an orm? i'm really struggling with sqlalchemy, even though i've had a bit of experience with sql
<isaac_rks>	what does it really give me over just writing queries, for a simple web app?
<jim>	to avoid sql
<usddddd>	easier to think about rows as objects
<miigotu>	# coding=utf8
<isaac_rks>	i find it easier to "think in sql" tbh..
<usddddd>	rather than sql you get to play with objects and methods rather than sql
<miigotu>	at the top of your py file jennifer
<jim>	so do i
<codetaku>	jennifer: is your use of that character intentional?  if so, just set your encoding by adding '# coding=utf-8' on the first or second line of your file
<miigotu>	# coding=utf-8
<miigotu>	i meant ^
<codetaku>	isaac_rks: well, if using an orm like djangos, it lets your framework understand your objects much better which makes many things nicer
<jennifer>	why does # coding=utf8 work? hm...
<jennifer>	codetaku, not sure why but i am trying to understand this person's code.
<jennifer>	so i am running it..
<jennifer>	# coding=utf-8 works too.
<isaac_rks>	my first experience of programming was writing sql queries so maybe i'm thinking about web dev the wrong way
<codetaku>	it sets the character encoding of the source file.  utf-8 permits characters like the a with the little hat which aren't part of ascii
<jim>	not necessarily
<usddddd>	i guess it depends on your application, sometimes orms save you from writing giant sql statements
<jim>	you don't have to use an orm
<jennifer>	why is "finally:" considered invalid syntax? hm.
<miigotu>	either you have to specify the coding type, or it assumes ascii, and that byte is not ascii
<jennifer>	codetaku, okay i understand now. thank you.
<miigotu>	i think you can also convert the file to utf-8 with bom and it will set the coding automagically
<codetaku>	jennifer: if a line looks ok but throws a syntaxerror, check the lines above it, one of them might be missing a parenthesis or something
<jennifer>	i don't see anything wrong with his code... hm.
<jim>	isn't there some kind of code analyser like lint for c?
<akagi201_>	why i must use `sudo pip install <something>` on mac os x recently? i use homebrew's python all the time.
<akagi201_>	does pip change its behaviour?
<codetaku>	jennifer: it's probably the 'else:' between the except and finally but on the same indentation level
<jennifer>	i don't see anything wrong with else and finally on the same indentation.
<jim>	akagi201_, pip is -not- recomended for sudo, or on the system-wide python
<codetaku>	what does that 'else' go to?  there is no 'if' or 'for' on the same level as it
<jennifer>	wait you're right.
<jennifer>	yeah.
<akagi201_>	now my system has two site-packages. /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages and /library/python/2.7/site-packages. how can i use the homebrew one?
<codetaku>	my guess would be that he broke up the "if timeleft <= 0:" block, jammed the except in there (when he should have put it after the else)
<jennifer>	any alternative? http://pastebin.com/g3dh2cdy
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/1nmmoa4tlgzdogpdwhno/ (repasted for jennifer)
<codetaku>	jennifer: try just removing the first 'socket', so its just mysocket = socket(....
<jim>	jennifer, just so you know... infobob is repasting because it thinks pastebin.com does weird things (capchas, force you to look at ads, etc) which you might not like
<jennifer>	yeah that's an import thing.
<zahlman>	i've only seen pastebin put up captchas when you submit things :/
<jennifer>	okay so now i have new problems. hm.
<jennifer>	let me try this.
<codetaku>	jennifer: the confusion stems from the imports containing both 'from socket import *' and 'import socket'... it looks like he might have mashed together source from 2 different places without quite understanding what he was doing
<zahlman>	and by the time you've submitted something and given the channel the link, it's too late to address that
<jennifer>	yeah i don't know why he did hat.
<zahlman>	... ah, we're stuck fixing someone else's code here, eh?
<jennifer>	the code is homework, i have the same textbook as him.
<jennifer>	but the textbook didn't do what he did.
<jennifer>	which is having two of the similar import socket statements.
<zahlman>	is this a group assignment or something?
<jim>	i thought she said she wants to understand his code
<jennifer>	nope.
<jennifer>	i just want to understand his code though.
<jennifer>	otherwise what's the point of doing this homework.
<codetaku>	jennifer: the comment refers to a previous exercise using ping, did you do that exercise?
<jennifer>	codetaku, yes.
<seylerius>	how do you include a literal # in a list item in yaml?
<codetaku>	just based on that comment, i imagine it might be easier to reuse that code and expand and build upon it
<zahlman>	seylerius: does this help? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20739639/how-to-escape-hash-character-in-a-multi-line-string-in-yaml
<jennifer>	codetaku, pretty much copy and paste.
<jennifer>	i wonder how many people copied and pasted from previous assignment or off the internet just because they're lazy.
<zahlman>	probably most of them
<jim>	that could be considered plagarism which can get you kicked from school... so be careful on that stuff
<miigotu>	jennifer: that doesnt help them learn anything. at least you are interested in understanding it.
<codetaku>	my presumption is that though forming the packet is the same, the way you loop sending multiple packets, timing the responses, etc are really the 'meat' of the assignment
<zahlman>	jim: absolutely agreed. i'm convinced it nevertheless happens a lot in comp sci related classes
<jennifer>	this specific assignment is pretty stupid though.
<jennifer>	it's poorly formatted and when i copied/pasted the skeleton code it didn't come out right.
<codetaku>	at my university, in the first year there were about 30 people who said they were going to major in cs, in the second year there were fewer than 10 left
<jim>	yeah, and, it's prbably a good idea to not share your code or another student could copy it and then you both look bad
<codetaku>	jennifer: formatting is pretty important with python code!  i'd raise the issue with your prof
<miigotu>	instructors usually can tell which of the two students' code it was originally
<jennifer>	:) yeah.
<mrnaz>	print(current.strftime("%a, %e %b %g"))    <-- i'm getting invalid string format on that line... what's wrong with it?
<jennifer>	with two or three tas and the professor himself, there are plenty of ways to check about 100 students.
<codetaku>	mrnaz: no such thing as %e
<zahlman>	mrnaz: `help(time.strftime)` should list all the valid codes for you
<mrnaz>	codetaku it's listed here:  http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/time_strftime.htm
<miigotu>	copy pasta python is no good. i think thats why you had the encoding error, your file itself is ascii, and the original was utf-8. and pasting in nano or other terminal emulators fooks indents
<miigotu>	anyways, gl. off to watch some bad tv
<codetaku>	mrnaz: that's... strange... it's not here:  http://strftime.org/
<mrnaz>	yea i'm looking at that site now
<mrnaz>	so
<jim>	copy pasta could be bad spaghetti
<mrnaz>	it turns out that information acquired using google can sometimes be unreliable.
<mrnaz>	shocked i tell you.
<codetaku>	it mentions at the bottom that the available format specifiers can differ by platform, that might be the deal
<mrnaz>	codetaku thanks :) i'd not have bothered looking up a different reference had you not pointed that out
<codetaku>	i'm just glad i didn't end up with the same one when i googled!
<lumber>	random question from a newbie, what's considered more ideal when making a string, the ' or the " character
<mrnaz>	:d
<zahlman>	the built-in help also mentions that "other codes may be available on your platform"
<zahlman>	i'm guessing the tutorialspoint people played around, found out what worked on their own platform and documented it
<miigotu>	lumber: tidy would replace all " with '
<mrnaz>	well
<jennifer>	https://bpaste.net/show/0b43a2cba95d
<zahlman>	i'm further guessing that they're overall not any more reliable than, say, w3schools
<lumber>	kk miigotu, thanks!
<miigotu>	ie for pep8
<mrnaz>	zahlman that's pretty harsh man
<zahlman>	i know
<codetaku>	miigotu: what about situations where a literal contains '?
<miigotu>	https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#string-quotes
<mrnaz>	anyways... thanks guys
<miigotu>	"in python, single-quoted strings and double-quoted strings are the same. this pep does not make a recommendation for this. pick a rule and stick to it. when a string contains single or double quote characters, however, use the other one to avoid backslashes in the string. it improves readability."
<monkeyseer>	in practice, i see single quotes more often
<miigotu>	yes monkeyseer, because python-tidy defaults to using single quotes, so it is assumed to be preferred
<lumber>	it would seem that using single-quote characters makes more sense for triple-quoted strings, no? miigotu. however i'll stick with whatever's convention.
<monkeyseer>	although switching from c/c++, i'm more used to double quotes :)
<jennifer>	https://bpaste.net/show/0b43a2cba95d what do i do when i see that an int is not callable?
<miigotu>	monkeyseer: same.
<codetaku>	jennifer: checksumtotal(checksumtotal >> 16)  tries to call a function named checksumtotal and pass it checksumtotal right-shifted by 16 bits
<lumber>	switching from java personally
<miigotu>	lumber: whatever you have to use to avoid backslashes, and to match the formattin of the rest of the document
<miigotu>	formatting*
<lumber>	makes sense
<codetaku>	jennifer: ah, you just missed a + in between checksumtotal and the (
<zahlman>	proofreading is an important skill for coding
<zahlman>	but also you have to be sure of what it is you want the code to do :)
<jennifer>	wait..
<jennifer>	oh that's..
<codetaku>	what kind of course is this jennifer?  i was assuming it's a networking course with python as a tool, but expecting you to implement your own checksum calculation function doesn't seem to fit with that
<jennifer>	just computer networking.
<jennifer>	intro to networking.
<jennifer>	why, is it supposed to be hard to do?
<codetaku>	although this looks like a crc16 checksum, maybe there's not a standard library crc16 function?
<monkeyseer>	sounds like something that would be taught with c
<codetaku>	not necessarily hard, just inconsistent with the goals of the course
<jennifer>	it's my school, i go to a shitty school.
<jennifer>	so that's expected.
<codetaku>	i'd expect 'here's the algorithm for generating a 16-bit crc, implement it' in an algorithms type of course
<codetaku>	and for doing a traceroute, i'd expect you to be provided with the necessary checksum function... it doesn't really help you understand how a path across the network is being mapped, which i presume is the purpose of the exercise
<jennifer>	well, maybe that's why my understanding of networking has been very dotted.
<codetaku>	feel free to let your prof know that a random internet stranger thinks he/she's distracting from the core benefit of the exercise ;)
<jennifer>	codetaku, he knows. lol
<jennifer>	it's a long story but this course got messed up when another school tried to butt in and run it.
<detre>	if my main reason is web development, is python a good choice? all biased answers are ignored.
<codetaku>	well crap, it's 4am.  i'd better get some sleep.  i'll be around tomorrow.  good luck jennifer
<jennifer>	good night.
<jennifer>	thanks a lot.
<jennifer>	detre, you want an unbiased answer, why are you in python? of course people will say that python is a good choice (but in all honesty it is a great choice).
<estan>	hum. i have a socketserver running in a separate thread (qthread, since i'm using qt), and i'm signaling it to shut down by calling shutdown() from my main (gui) thread, but if there are clients connected and making request, shutdown() never returns.
<estan>	anyone had this problem? afaics from the docs, i'm doing the right thing.
<detre>	jennifer, are you a student?
<jennifer>	detre, yes.
<jennifer>	https://bpaste.net/show/1ad6ff47c854 can anybody tell me about this one?
<estan>	to be clear: in the server thread, the socketserver is in a serve_forever() call.
<detre>	jennifer, so why you answer my question if you obviously have no real life experience. i have been a system developer for 12 years, i want to talk to someone that has some real experience. not biased answers.
<monkeyseer>	great way to solicit advice
<cyphase>	detre, i think it was a pretty reasonable question. no need for rudeness :)
<jennifer>	detre, who knows, maybe because my professor knows a lot more than you? :)
<zahlman>	codetaku: introductory level courses expect you to reinvent wheels all the time.
<monkeyseer>	although typically not at the minute protocol level
<detre>	jennifer, re-read again, i have been a system developer for 12 years with a master in embedded systems. your professor is exactly as you said, professor. not developer.
<detre>	learn the difference :)
<zahlman>	detre: you don't have to be able to write 'hello world', to understand that #python is not a place to get an unbiased answer to a "should i use python" question. that's common sense.
<jennifer>	detre, all of my professors have worked in google, yahoo, nasa, etc, before coming here and teaching. not worried about what your 12 years with a master can do. lol
<kadoban>	detre: so your basic plan is to ask a question, then belittle anyone who answers? fun.
<estan>	this is my server thread: https://paste.kde.org/pfgfjiqkv , and here's how i start it and then try to shut it down: https://paste.kde.org/pbt6vozc2 , but for some reason, shutdown() blocks indefinitely until all clients have disconnected.
<zahlman>	everything else in that discussion is a distraction.
<zahlman>	detre: if your credentials were relevant, you would be using them to research an answer on your own.
<cyphase>	boom
<jennifer>	detre, i can also give you my professor's email, which is public information, if you want to reach out and tell him why his biased opinion of python is not good.
<estan>	(modbustcpserver is from pymodbus, it inherits socketserver)
<zahlman>	(er, the corresponding skillset, i mean.)
<jennifer>	the same professor who is teaching this course also has, omg, a phd in cs and math. he has published papers and worked with darpa. oh on.
<jennifer>	s/on/no
<jennifer>	anyway, you can't expect a truly unbiased answer in a channel that is dedicated to it. go ask ##programming.
<detre>	jennifer, you obviously don't understand the difference between a professor and developer.
<detre>	jennifer, when you get out to the real life, come back and give stupid advice. until then, go do your homework.
<monkeyseer>	jennifer: i suggest you don't feed the troll
<zahlman>	^
<cyphase>	+1
<zahlman>	(do we not have any mods/ops here?)
<jennifer>	monkeyseer, yeah okay. sorry.
<karstenk>	how to assign a new key to dict? i get every time keyerror
<cyphase>	karstenk, d[key] = value
<zahlman>	karstenk: what code are you trying?
<peng>	karstenk: what they said, but if that isn't enough,could you pastebin your code and the error?
<peng>	karstenk: what they said, but if that isn't enough,could you pastebin your code and the traceback? *
<karstenk>	cats[category.categoryid] = list
<estan>	sorry, to be even more clear, modbustcpserver inherits socketserver.threadingtcpserver. so i would think shutdown() is the correct way to signal it to shut down when it's inside a serve_forever() call.
<karstenk>	cats and list are dict()
<karstenk>	the id is a str
<cyphase>	maybe you're keyerror is coming from category.categoryid? also, don't use list as a variable name; it's a built-in
<karstenk>	ahno, i was in my for block, that causes the error
<karstenk>	want
<karstenk>	was not
<jennifer>	what do you do when you get this? valueerror: need more than 6 values to unpack
<cyphase>	jennifer, looks like you're not giving enough values for the number of variables you're trying to unpack into
<cyphase>	jennifer, what's the code?
<jennifer>	sec..
<jennifer>	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13448781/struct-unpack-requires-string-argument-of-length-16
<dlitz>	detre: i've been writing code since 1988, and i've been writing code for pay since 2001, and much of this has involved web development.  jennifer is correct, python is good for web development.
<jennifer>	same as this guy's.
<dlitz>	detre: but really, as a system developer of 12+ years, you should already know that the deciding factor is going to be whether python is well-suited to your particular problem space. if you're just doing database crud, then basically anything will work, even (*shudder*) php.
<peng>	jennifer: are you using struct?
<dlitz>	detre: so maybe if you posted some details about your question, instead of demanding credentials from the volunteers here as if they owe you something (they don't), you might get a more helpful response?
<jennifer>	peng, yes.
<jennifer>	thanks dlitz but we have decided that he's a troll. :)
<dlitz>	jennifer: yeah, well i guess i am more cynical than you are.  "troll" implies insincerity, whereas i assume he's just being a jerk. :p
<cyphase>	ogre?
<phasip>	is there any library that gives me a bit higher level tcp-sockets? for example i want to read 5 bytes and block until exactly 5 bytes are read and keep the rest for later reading. is there any library that allows me to do this by a simple socket.read(5) or similar?
<jim>	yeah... if he demands credentials, someone sould demand money
<jennifer>	they might be angry at the manny vs mayweather fight.
<dlitz>	phasip: python 3's asyncio module has .readexactly(5), but if you don't want to use asyncio, you can use rfile = socket.makefile("rb") and then use rfile.read(5), which i think will work how you want
<phasip>	oo, thanks!
<detre>	dlitz, i see. we used python in the university to do scientific work and such but never have i looked at python for web development. so the last years i have been looking into some startups and i saw a lot of rails but also python. how will the future for python in the web development area look you think for 5, 10 years? node.js having some hype right now also. i use python for scientific work and we also used it in a comp
<detre>	any for hft. but i'm unsure about web development and all the frameworks.
<detre>	jennifer, do your homework.
<dlitz>	detre: i don't really feel like answering more when you disparage the other volunteers here.  you'll have to do your own homework as far as i'm concerned.
<dlitz>	phasip: basically, .recv(...) might return fewer than the requested number of bytes, but .read(...) should behave like any other file-like object---it should return the full number of bytes unless the connection is closed or you've set non-blocking mode
<detre>	dlitz, no, i won't be taking advice from a student about real life development. you are bounded to the channel i see, have some own respect and answer as an individual, not because of others :)
<phasip>	dlitz: yeah, thats exactly what i was looking for, but i'll also check out asyncio =)
<jim>	jennifer (and all including myself who are tired of the noise): this might work: /ignore *!*@c-d6a571d5.123-3-64736c10.cust.bredbandsbolaget.se all
<jennifer>	great idea, thank you.
<jennifer>	https://bpaste.net/show/ca05750c077d last one for the night then i'm going to bed. thoughts?
<spcomb>	jennifer: you can use dpkt for handling raw packets and checksums
<jennifer>	hm.
<jennifer>	not sure i should.
<jennifer>	i don't want to use something i don't understand yet.
<dlitz>	jennifer: it seems pointless for packetformat to be a separate variable when the variables it's being unpacked into are all hard-coded
<jim>	welcome. just cause you're a student doesn't mean you deserve random stupidity or disrespect
<dlitz>	jennifer: it also obscures the problem.  if you'd written: a,b,c,d = struct.unpack("bbbbl", ...)  it would be clear what the problem is
<jennifer>	dlitz, it might be but.. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13448781/struct-unpack-requires-string-argument-of-length-16 somebody posted a solution i thought might work, or i thought i understood.
<jennifer>	what he posted, making packetformat on its own, made the error go away.
<jennifer>	but introduced that one i posted.
<jennifer>	oh.
<jennifer>	can you look at mark tolonen's answer and see what he wrote, if it makes sense to you?
<dlitz>	jennifer: is this python 2 or 3?
<dlitz>	because in python 3, somestring[x] returns an int, but in python 2, it returns a string of length 1
<dlitz>	oh wait no, that's with bytearrays
<jennifer>	dlitz, 2.
<dlitz>	oh, but i guess it could still be a problem in python 3 if str is supposed to be a str but it's a bytes
<jennifer>	definitely using 2 here. python 3 wouldn't work.
<dlitz>	ok
<karstenk>	good morning
<jennifer>	because in python 3, this is interpreted differently: countto = (len(str) / 2) * 2
<jennifer>	that becomes a float.
<jennifer>	in 2 it's an int.
<karstenk>	please can you help with that, i have to transform a two dimensional dict into tree node  http://pastebin.com/sawmh3xt
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/6zalssjh2tmrwy57ikdy/ (repasted for karstenk)
<dlitz>	jennifer: ah, ok, yeah.
<jim>	it's good you're picking up the differences between py2 and py3, someday you might be tempted to use py3
<dlitz>	jennifer: mark tolonen's answer seems sensible (disclaimer: i haven't looked too closely)
<jennifer>	thanks. :) it's just a matter of reading as much as time lets me.
<karstenk>	my problem are the last 4 lines
<jennifer>	i wish i can help, i said my own problem would be the last one karstenk. it's almost 5am here..
<dlitz>	py3 is amazing.  if your dependencies support it, you should definitely use py3.  of course, people doing web stuff will be the last to be able to, because they have so many deps.
<jennifer>	dlitz, i wonder how long i can squeeze py2? think i can still write code in py2 in the next 3-5 years?
<cyphase>	karstenk, first of all, on line 11, you can't do cat.categoryid; you have to do cat['categoryid']
<spcomb>	jennifer: your packetformat only contains 6 fields, and you're unpacking 7 items
<jennifer>	hm, i think the person is doing the same thing in his code.
<shibe>	guys why isnt this bouncing properly http://hastebin.com/ejehadehif.py
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/ukxw6jyq1lm5vc1bwied/ (repasted for shibe)
<karstenk>	cyphase cat of cats returned only the key as str, confusing me
<shibe>	https://gfycat.com/forthrightclutteredantelope
<jennifer>	i should add one more to the packetformat but i'm not sure which.
<dlitz>	jennifer: it depends.  there's some debate about that, but my take on it is that the community is moving to python 3, with the lowest-level libraries happening first, and gradually moving up the global dependency tree.  if your application has a deep dependency tree, then it might be more work to support python 3 than it is to deal with the python 2 crappiness that's fixed in python 3.  if your application mostly just uses the standard library and a few othe
<dlitz>	 deps, then it's probably worth using python 3 now.
<jennifer>	i gotta look and compare each variable to each specific letter but i'm too tired to do that now.
<jim>	jennifer, well of course... especially if you keep a copy of the source. a lot of people who feel py3 doesn't make sense won't "autmatically" be switching
<cyphase>	karstenk, sorry, can you rephrase that?
<dlitz>	jennifer: converting an app from python 2 to python 3 is always harder than supporting python 3 from day 1.
<jennifer>	i wonder if python has the same problem as c++ right now (controversy that you should google, for interest - design and death by committee).
<jennifer>	stroustrup recently came up with a pdf about how he wants to deal with this problem.
<karstenk>	for cat in cats: print cat       prints not the dict, but a string representing the key in cats
<jennifer>	would be interesting to see if python has a similar problem.
<dlitz>	jennifer: i'd at least try to get my test suite running on python 3, stubbing out tests that can't work on python 3, so that at least the trivial stuff works on both 2 and 3.  but in general, i don't ask "can i continue to use python 2", but "do i *have* to continue using python 2".
<cyphase>	write unit tests and use tox to run them with multiple versions of python
<jennifer>	dlitz, maybe i should wait for python 4?
<zahlman>	shibe: your code updates a 'yincrement' value, but uses 'increment' to modify the 'ypos'.
<jim>	u playing with c++ also?
<zahlman>	shibe: i think pygame has support for point/vector/rectangle types that you'd find useful here
<shibe>	zahlman: oh ok
<jennifer>	my school uses both languages to teach, yep.
<jennifer>	i learned c++11 and python 2.
<dlitz>	jennifer: python 4 won't be all that different from python 3.
<zahlman>	(so that you can store the x and y information in single variables, and have the vector math 'just work')
<jennifer>	haven't caught up with py3 or c++14 yet.
<zahlman>	dlitz: is python 4 announced already?
<shibe>	iits fixed now
<dlitz>	zahlman: i don't think so, but when python 3 was being announced, they said that python 4 won't be this big of a change.
<dlitz>	zahlman: i mean, making another change this big would be pretty hard.  how often can you fundamentally change what "string" means?
<zahlman>	shibe: i think you'll find that your bounds threshold is also wrong. (try having the code do the math to subtract box size from window size, rather than doing it yourself)
<zahlman>	dlitz: i suppose. on the other hand, if they *don't* make that big of a change, do they have a motivation to not just call it 3.(n+1)?
<dlitz>	zahlman: *shrug* i never thought there was going to be a linux 3.x until the userspace abi changed (like it did from 1.x -> 2.x), but here i am running linux 3.19.
<zahlman>	:)
<dlitz>	iirc the old loki installers assumed that the kernel major version was an abi version, and refuse to install on linux 3.
<jennifer>	old school, very old school.
<jennifer>	dlitz, did you read the most recent post by linus? it's sort of humorous. i'll post it if you ike.
<dlitz>	jennifer: which one?
<go|dfish>	karstenk: looks like you want: for cat in cats.values(): if category["categoryparentid"] ...
<jennifer>	one moment, i get it.
<jennifer>	https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=39a8804455fb23f09157341d3ba7db6d7ae6ee76
<jennifer>	https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/4/12/178
<cyphase>	karstenk, also, you're saying for cat.., then using category
<go|dfish>	karstenk: make that 'if cat["categoryparentid"]' (as category is not declared anywhere else)
<dlitz>	jennifer: lol, well there you go.  til.  heh, i thought you weren't supposed to know anything, since you're "just a student"? :p
<zahlman>	heh.
<zahlman>	(i don't really see the humour, but honestly i find torvalds more entertaining when he's insulting people)
<jennifer>	i don't, i'm actually just good at reading.
<zahlman>	also a useful skill.
<jennifer>	i read a lot.
<jennifer>	that's about it.
<jennifer>	here's a real insult: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivpoykcnzyw&spfreload=10
<karstenk>	i got it, cats was a dict too, i changed to a list of dicts and now it works
<jennifer>	skip to about 1:30.
<dlitz>	i tend to read stuff on the web (or irc, today) instead of sleeping
<dlitz>	oh god, nvidia totally deserved that
<zahlman>	:3
<dlitz>	they're basically the reason why linux video was set back 5-10 years.
<jennifer>	i also go to a relatively decent school that i call shitty because of how much trouble i get into with it.
<dlitz>	somebody should do a plot of the linux & python version numbers over time.  linux sat on 2.6.x for a long time, but then, how many of us have been able to deprecate python 2.6 yet?
<jennifer>	give me the data and i can plot it.
<dlitz>	i mean, actually nobody should do that.  there are far better uses for volunteer time than that.  but still...
<zahlman>	i have, but i'm unemployed, so.
<dlitz>	zahlman: *hi-five*
<jennifer>	:p
<zahlman>	(in fact i've been rather aggressively using new features like the keyword-only arguments)
<zahlman>	honestly i'd like to see that kind of thing make its way into the standard library, damn the torpedos.
<cyphase>	i made a decorator to somewhat mimic that in python 2
<zahlman>	because some modules are really prone to subtle bugs if you haven't named the arguments (like `re`) imx
<jim>	yeah saw that.... did you see his git talk?
<zahlman>	jim: you mean torvalds?
<dlitz>	keyword-only arguments are the best, although i tend to just assume that any argument that has a default value should be specified as a keyword argument
<jim>	yeah
<cyphase>	well, really what it does is restrict the keys in **kwargs
<dlitz>	(i mean the feature is the best, not that every argument should be keyword-only.  awscli, i'm looking at you)
<karstenk>	cyphase can you again help with that line?         nodes = dict((cat['categoryid'], node(cat)) for cat in cats)
<jim>	also did you see his talk to a debian crowd where he told his reasons for staying with gplv2 for the kernel?
<karstenk>	at the moment it makes for every cat a node, but it should only make a node for categorylevel 1
<zahlman>	cyphase: but i can explicitly specify **kwargs afterwards...
<zahlman>	dlitz: "awscli"? a cli module by amazon web services, or something?
<dlitz>	jim: i tend not to pay too much attention to linus when it comes to his views on politics or ethics or anything "social" like that (or crypto). he isn't very good at those things.
<karstenk>	so the children also be at the first level of nodes, thats wrong
<dlitz>	jim: his gplv2 "clarification" at the time probably wasn't even legal.  linux's own copying file said that if it doesn't specify a version of the gpl, then you can use any version, and linux didn't, but suddenly then linux "clarified" that it was always gplv2 only.
<dlitz>	jim: of course, some files actually said that in the headers, but others had "or any later version" in them.  but yeah, linus tends not to understand anything except technical issues, which is fine as long as we don't excessively trust him in those other areas
<jennifer>	sigh.
<cyphase>	zahlman, def method(self, *args, timeout=none) doesn't work in py2, so i made a decorator that allows me to do @restrict_kwargs('timeout')\ndef method(self, *args, **kwargs). that way even though it's using kwargs, anything but timeout causes a typeerror as if it was defined as def method(self, *args, timeout=none)
<dlitz>	cyphase: that sucks for docs generation, though, right?
<jim>	that's a pretty sweeping statement :)
<cyphase>	dlitz, i use functools.wraps inside; or do you mean something else?
<karstenk>	cyphase http://pastebin.com/cmdwmva5
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/dzqgvlpbugjn6kzyueo0/ (repasted for karstenk)
<zahlman>	cyphase: ah, i see.
<dlitz>	cyphase: no, not just __doc__, but for getting the function''s signature.  things like help(func) show you the function's signature, but that signature is less useful when it's just "func(self, *args, **kwargs)"
<dimitrovskif>	facebook sdk is returning "\u0424\u0438\u043b\u0438\u043f", how do i make that a printable string in python 3?
<jennifer>	okay.
<jennifer>	i guess i'll go to sleep.
<jennifer>	what time zone are you guys in? why aren't you all sleeping?
<jennifer>	it's 5am now.
<zahlman>	dlitz: but the decorator has access to the kwargs whitelist, so it could override that i guess? or generate a note in the docstring at least
<jim>	eastcoaster
<jennifer>	ditto here, nyc.
<jim>	well not me, i'm in calif
<dimitrovskif>	in json/javascript "\u0424\u0438\u043b\u0438\u043f" is completely valid printable string, in python3 that raises a unicodeencodeerror on my console... why?
<zahlman>	dimitrovskif: if you can't just `print` it, it's more an issue with your terminal setup than with python
<dlitz>	dimitrovskif: you don't have a unicode console?
<dimitrovskif>	dlitz: zahlman i am trying cygwin now, same thing happens. cygwin should support unicode, right?
<dlitz>	jennifer: pacific, but it's still 2am here
<dlitz>	jennifer: later
<dimitrovskif>	dlitz: zahlman: i know windows cmd has issues with unicode, though.
<jennifer>	good night.
<zahlman>	does http://x.cygwin.com/docs/faq/cygwin-x-faq.html#q-xterm-utf8 help?
<dlitz>	dimitrovskif: oh... yeah.  maybe idle works better?  (i forget, is idle unicode-aware on windows?)
<cyphase>	dlitz, but i can't do def func(self, *args, timeout=none) in python 2 anyway
<dlitz>	cyphase: right, i'm just saying that it makes your code more obscure than it would be in pure python 3 code
<dimitrovskif>	dlitz:: zahlman: guys, tried it on repl.it - yep it works; gotta be a console unicode support prob
<cyphase>	dlitz, oh, sure. but then it wouldn't work in python 2 :). am i missing something?
<zahlman>	you mean, besides a python 3 installation? ;)
<cyphase>	lol, i have a python 3 installation, but i want it to work in python 2 as well
<dlitz>	cyphase: not really.  it's just that it pains me to take clean, readable, python 3 code and mangle it to support python 2.  we did that in pycrypto to support python 2.1, and the result is awful code that barely anyone understands.
<cyphase>	though i guess, maybe it doesn't matter
<karstenk>	how can i express that correct way:  nodes = dict((cat['categoryid'], node(cat)) for cat(where categorylevel = 1) in cats)
<zahlman>	oh lordy, all the way back to 2.1? :(
<dlitz>	integer divisions like a//b are done as divmod(a,b)[0] because that's the only thing that's compatible across python 2.1 thru 3.4
<dlitz>	zahlman: 2.1 through 2.5 are basically equally hard, more or less
<zahlman>	karstenk: something like {cat['categoryid']: node(cat) for cat in cats if cat.categorylevel == 1}
<zahlman>	depending on exactly what you mean
<dlitz>	zahlman: not exactly, but you don't gain much in pycrypto until you drop everything before 2.6
<zahlman>	but i mean, in 2.1 you don't get list comprehensions iirc?
<zahlman>	(and you know, `divmod` is actually kinda cool when you want both values)
<dlitz>	sure, but you don't in 2.2 either
<zahlman>	:)
<zahlman>	come to think of it, i started in 2.3
<karstenk>	nodes = dict((cat['categoryid'], node(cat)) for cat in cats if cat.categorylevel == '1')  not working
<cyphase>	i use divmod when i need minutes, seconds = divmod(total_seconds, 60)
<jim>	if i do: class foo(object): s = []
<zahlman>	karstenk: then you're going to have to think more about what it is that you want, and what data you're working with
<dlitz>	if i were to do it again, i'd write the code in python 3, then use the same codec hack that https://github.com/dropbox/pyxl does to do some sort of lib2to3-esque thing that rewrites my python 3 idioms to use decorators or whatever, like you did, but the source code itself would be pristine, python 3 code
<cyphase>	karstenk, what are you trying to do?
<zahlman>	i gave you an outline of the syntax
<dlitz>	then, when i finally want to drop python 2 support, i'd just drop the cruft.
<jim>	do i get one list in foo for all foo objects?
<zahlman>	3to2? :)
<dlitz>	zahlman: yeah, something like that
<karstenk>	i want that in this line not all cat makes a parent not, only them with level 1
<karstenk>	nodes = dict((cat['categoryid'], node(cat)) for cat in cats if cat.categorylevel == '1')
<karstenk>	but that expression dont work
<zahlman>	jim: yes, everything defined inside the `class` block is part of the class
<jim>	in foo methods, i can access it with self.s?
<karstenk>	at the moment my children elements exists as children and as parent, but thats wrong
<dlitz>	zahlman: actually, even something in setup.py would be fine, rather than the codec hack, but the main thing would be that i'd make the compatibility code severable.  ultimately, in a foss project, the people who want backward compatibility should be the ones to bear the cost of it, not the people who want to move with the state of the art.  otherwise, nothing moves.
<cyphase>	karstentk, it's not cat.categorylevel; it's cat['categorylevel']
<zahlman>	jim: yes. however, note that *assigning* to self.s will *not* affect the class attribute, but add a separate one on the instance
<zahlman>	(it has to work like this, otherwise __init__ could never work)
<karstenk>	make sense
<zahlman>	karstenk: i had no idea what kind of object `cat` was, so :)
<dlitz>	jim: it's worth learning what "method resolution order" is in python.  a.__mro__ is your friend
<karstenk>	list element
<karstenk>	ohno, it is a dict
<karstenk>	in a list^^
<cyphase>	karstenk, but i meant, what is your goal? what task are you trying to accomplish with this code?
<zahlman>	(anything can be a list element :) )
<zahlman>	jim: a longer writeup: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11007627/python-variable-declaration/11008311#11008311
<dlitz>	python's inheritance model makes sooo much sense once you understand how attribute resolution works.
<zahlman>	(i don't think he was asking about inheritance though?)
<cyphase>	dlitz, you're just biased. go do your homework
<zahlman>	oh no, we have a meme now
<zahlman>	this surely spells the end of intelligent discourse :(
<cyphase>	:d
<dlitz>	cyphase: yes, knowing what cpython's pyobject struct looks like certainly introduces some biases.
<cyphase>	dlitz, indeed :)
<dlitz>	cyphase: the pypy folks are not amused.
<zahlman>	heh
<zahlman>	i am definitely guilty of performance tuning to cpython
<hd1>	anyone know a good package to calculate the readability of a text? textstat seems, umm, messed up
<zahlman>	if only because `timeit` is fun to play with
<dlitz>	cpython is actually a really nice implementation.  like, if you get rid of the bytecode dispatcher, i feel it's still a decently nice object system and standard library for writing stuff in c.
<zahlman>	'readability' as in grade level for reading comprehension?
<hd1>	zahlman: yes
<hd1>	like flesch-kinaid for english
<cyphase>	i found several results immediately with a search for "python calculate grade level of a text"
<dlitz>	zahlman: another thing you can do, if you have a decent c library, is to just use cffi to access the library directly.  it's a little tricky, but cffi (unlike ctypes) has checks to make sure you're doing it properly, if you use .verify().
<dlitz>	hd1: ^ that was for you
<dlitz>	hd1: but if you're going to use cffi, make sure you know how pointers & memory management works in c, because you're still effectively interfacing with c and cffi will happily garbage-collect your buffer before you're done with it if you don't know what you're doing.
<dlitz>	(this is also true for ctypes)
<jwad>	yhg1s, are you online?
<dlitz>	anyway, time for me to sleep, too.  nice chatting with you folks
<cyphase>	'night
<lanox>	could someone tell me what is w in os.devnull, 'w', does it mean write ?
<cyphase>	lanox, you mean open(os.devnull, 'w')? then yes
<lanox>	as you can tell i am learning python .. looking at this https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html?highlight=os.devnull#os.devnull
<lanox>	cyphase:  yes that is correct
<lanox>	so it just means that /dev/null is open for writing ?
<cyphase>	yes
<lanox>	okay thanks.
<cyphase>	sure :)
<lanox>	cyphase: just wondering why isnt that documented on the os.devnull page or am i doing it wrong
<jim>	it;s the same to open any file for writing
<lanox>	jim:  fair call
<cyphase>	lanox, os.devnull is just a variable that tells you the file path of the null device.
<karstenk>	cyphase  i have to create new records in database for every category, the callback of create is the new created id, which i have to store for create children
<yeryry>	why are you using devnull anyway, if you don't know how to use normal files?
<karstenk>	i need any storage for that task
<karstenk>	trying for 2 day now
<lanox>	yeryry: i never said i dont know how to use normal files, thanks i was just confirming that is what it mean
<lanox>	rather then assuming its what it does
<lanox>	and as i mention my backgound is not in programing i am learning as i am going ...
<lanox>	cyphase: thanks for explaining it.
<karstenk>	but to create my records, i need first a tree of that categorys to specify the children elements and to create them in a row
<karstenk>	the fields of every category are  id, parentid and level
<nickedes>	i want to write automated unittests for this https://github.com/nickedes/crypteda ,but how? can anyone help
<cyphase>	nickedes, there are many ways of doing unit tests. i like pytest: pytest.org
<shibe>	how do you do collision in pygame?
<shibe>	i only know how to do it if it hits the borders
<shibe>	but not with one shape and another
<cyphase>	shibe, here are some functions you can use: http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/sprite.html#pygame.sprite.spritecollide
<shibe>	cyphase: will this work with rectangles?
<sternmull>	can anyone suggest a lightweight python cms-like thingy? i basically need a relatively simple site where non-devs can edit the content. but i would like to keep full control over the layout and template system. i am fine if it takes a week or so to put this together.
<zahlman>	sternmull: https://wiki.python.org/moin/contentmanagementsystems
<dazpetty>	this is a pretty open question, but can anybody recommend which gui api i should use with python
<dazpetty>	?
<dazpetty>	tkiter /gtk / qt ?
<karstenk>	please can anybody help me with my task?
<zahlman>	dazpetty: it's pretty much personal choice (although the built-in one kinda sucks)
<dazpetty>	i didn't know there was a build it one
<dazpetty>	sooo just go ahead and make a recommendation, which has the best learning resources tetc?
<zahlman>	(i mean tkinter)
<dazpetty>	ah
<cyphase>	shibe, http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/rect.html#pygame.rect.collidepoint
<zahlman>	i personally like wxpython, but i haven't honestly done a lot with it.
<nickedes>	cyphase: k :)
<cyphase>	shibe, i don't know pygame; i'm basically just doing searches for you :)
<shibe>	okay thank you cyphase
<sternmull>	zahlman: i saw this list. the problem is that it is pretty dusty and it is difficult to tell what is good. i used django (without any cms ontop of it) for the first version of the website i had to made. and in the end django, the task and i where a bed combination for the job. so now i try to find tools that fit better.
<zahlman>	:(
<zahlman>	django seems to be the usual top recommendation, and i can't say i've heard of the rest of the stuff there
<zahlman>	other names i hear mentioned are bottle, flask and web.py
<zahlman>	but i don't think any of them are "cms out of box"
<zahlman>	sternmull: it would probably help to put together a more concrete requirements list.
<sternmull>	yeah... and i am not even sure if i realy want a cms. what people told me about the popular cmses always sounded like horror.
<orly_owl>	no django for you?
<cyphase>	karstenk, what is your starting data??
<cyphase>	oops, ?*
<saturn812>	django is not a cms either
<karstenk>	the response object = reply
<sternmull>	orly_owl: i hoped django would make things easier. but in many situations its abstraction made things much more difficult and ugly than they should have been. i think i spent more time fighting django than profiting from it.
<cyphase>	karstenk, it's late; you need to be more clear so i don't have to think as hard about what you mean :)
<orly_owl>	heh, ive never touched django personally but i assume it is absolute rubbish due to it being a "cms"
<karstenk>	http://pastebin.com/rl1jggyr
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/ifmich4csqvo8zcjpned/ (repasted for karstenk)
<karstenk>	thats my response
<cyphase>	orly_owl, django isn't a cms, it's a framework
<orly_owl>	ok
<jim>	wen u asume u make a as of u n me
<saturn812>	flask is also a framework, but a little bit more simple (proper english right here)
<sternmull>	zahlman: about the requirements. i think they are pretty basic: custom layout (not just a blog or something), a few "static sites" (editable but linked by menus and stuff that does not need to be non-dev-editable), and some lists of items with text and images that must be creatable and editable by non-dev admins.
<zahlman>	sternmull: so you want to insert text into a template or something?
<yeryry>	does it need to be python-related?
<saturn812>	actually, i never ever heard about python cms
<yhg1s>	there's plenty of cmses written in python.
<cyphase>	karstenk, can you create some small sample data, instead of that wall of text? also, there's no code there
<yhg1s>	plone has been around for ages.
<cyphase>	zope
<yhg1s>	zope is not a cms.
<cyphase>	no, you're right
<cyphase>	like i said, late
<sternmull>	zahlman: users dont need to edit templates. for the things in the database there would be one template per "type" and the content that is rendered by that templates must be editable.
<jim>	orly_owl, seriously... you can see what some of django is by running its tutorial (you can do it in watchamovie mode)
<sternmull>	yeryry: it does not really have to be python based. but i like python more than php. but if i would find a php thing that fits nicely than i would use that.
<zahlman>	sternmull: it sounds like all you really want is a templating system and a server for it :/
<yeryry>	if it's a good cms, you shouldn't need to mess with the code at all...?
<sternmull>	zahlman: yes. and some javascript stuff to allow editing for logged in authorized users. putting that together by myself would be possible. but i would like to minimize the stuff i have to do. last time it took me months of free time to get the site done... nothing i would like to repeat.
<karstenk>	that was only the response data which i have to transform
<zahlman>	sternmull: honestly i would use node.js and something like espresso, but i'm sure that's not what you came here to hear :)
<karstenk>	i dont know how to transform i tried with http://pastebin.com/7rkdnsn7  , but that not works
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/uj0ejzkblz6ijfd5o6va/ (repasted for karstenk)
<sternmull>	yeryry: i fear that with a cms that at some point i will have to change some things. and this is the reason i am looking for a lightweight cms that does not make me reading and experimenting for a month until i get it to do what i want.
<karstenk>	i tried to transforme in that tree node http://pastebin.com/xrggkjta  but that not works for more than 2 level
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/pmwm2gdpnjyyqpbggssi/ (repasted for karstenk)
<cyphase>	karstenk, i don't know what you want to transform, or how. try starting over. think about your problem, simplify it as much as you can so we only address the relevant code, then we'll see what we can do. generate some small sample data, not a dict with hundreds of items. also, i don't know the api you're using, so you'll need to explain, if you *have* to include api calls at all. add comments in the code for explanation
<karstenk>	ok, step by step
<karstenk>	first i have to transform like that http://pastebin.com/rcr0d8jh
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/cgghw7l2f9fakfuxunqw/ (repasted for karstenk)
<karstenk>	from a list to a multidimensional array respecting the categorylevel
<karstenk>	for unlimited levels, my list is now shorten
<karstenk>	so a category with categorylevel = 1 is at first level of my multidimensional array and so on
<karstenk>	cyphase as result i wanted to create new records like this http://pastebin.com/bc0sf8r6
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/yfecxg8em912i6iu8qfh/ (repasted for karstenk)
<karstenk>	thats why i need that tree for iterating create
<dadaas>	hi, can someone help me: http://pastebin.com/s8rppqtd i get this error:     proxy = driver.find_elements_by_xpath("/html/body/section/section[4]/section[1]/div/table/tbody/tr/td[2]").text()
<dadaas>	attributeerror: 'list' object has no attribute 'text'  btw i m noob and sterugling with this error for 3 days. i m using this code for learning pourpouse, since i wish to elarn how to scrape
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/6kppbdeke72xsln4bosz/ (repasted for dadaas)
<robhol>	well, uh
<yhg1s>	dadaas: driver.find_elements_by_xpath returns a list. presumably a list of elements. you can't call the 'text' method on a list, because it has no such method. perhaps you want to iterate over the list of elements and call the 'text' method of the items.
<robhol>	it says right in the error message what the problem is
<karstenk>	cyphase could you understand now?
<karstenk>	please no one who can help?
<karstenk>	is the task so hard?
<|zz|>	dadaas: perhaps you expected a single element as a result, in this case the list will have a single element too, and you can access to it with find_elements_by_xpath(...)[0].text()
<|zz|>	dadaas: the result is always a list, even if it is only a single matching
<l403>	karstenk: maybe your question is just too dificult understand in the limited time people are willing to spend thinking about someones problem. maybe try to break it down to smaller pieces
<karstenk>	ive done, transform a list into a tree node (multidimensional array) http://pastebin.com/
<adam007>	hello, i just install this package on windows https://github.com/gaganpreet/udemy-dl but when try to run "py -m udemy-dl" it's say no module named udemy-dl
<adam007>	what i'm supposed to do ?
<karstenk>	i have a list, where a value is the level in array
<chchjesus>	adam007: you need to import it first
<adam007>	how ?
<adam007>	i already install the packacge.
<chchjesus>	import udemy-dl
<karstenk>	and idś and parent idś
<chchjesus>	karstenk: what's up?
<jim>	in your script
<jim>	but wait, doesn't -m import it?
<adam007>	i already use "py -m pip install udemy-dl"
<codetaku>	adam007: did you install udemy-dl using pip?
<adam007>	yes..
<jim>	what
<codetaku>	ok, cool
<jim>	is py?
<karstenk>	i have a list with elements. elements have 4 key:value pairs (name, id, parent_id,level). from that list i need to transform to an multidemensional array, level represents level in array and parent_id refers to id. how can i do that??? http://pastebin.com/
<adam007>	well when try to use py import udemy-dl it didn't work..
<codetaku>	what do you get if you just type 'udemy-dl' at the commandline?
<adam007>	can't open file udemy-dl
<adam007>	i see udemy-dl in folder name lib/site-package
<codetaku>	you probably need to add whatever folder that is to your windows path
<karstenk>	building like a sitemap or a "like" a category tree^^
<karstenk>	chchjesus to hard?
<chchjesus>	no, i don't understand what you are asking
<karstenk>	what isnt concret with this i have a list with elements. elements have 4 key:value pairs (name, id, parent_id,level). from that list i need to transform to an multidemensional array, level represents level in array and parent_id refers to id. how can i do that???
<dadaas>	yes, it is a list and i expect a list. so why i cant call .text() on list? i was thinking it will attach a list to the variable. also i coded a for loop for each item in list to get.attribute('text') but that didnt work too. it gave me no error, but it sayed none
<chchjesus>	karstenk: so you have a list of dictionaries, and you want to turn it into a list of lists?
<karstenk>	no in list of dicts in list of dicts in list of dicts and so on, causing by the given maximum level
<chchjesus>	[[v for (k,v) in element.get_items()] for element in elements]
<adam007>	okay did i miss something ?
<chchjesus>	adam007: open a python interpreter
<codetaku>	karstenk: why not mock up an example of what you're talking about - what an example of the input would look like and what you want the data structures to look like after your function runs on the input?
<chchjesus>	then type "import udemy-dl" (without quotes)
<chchjesus>	what happens if you do that?>
<karstenk>	what ive done wih [[v for (k,v) in element.get_items()] for element in elements]
<karstenk>	sry
<karstenk>	what ive done with http://pastebin.com/rcr0d8jh
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/cgghw7l2f9fakfuxunqw/ (repasted for karstenk)
<karstenk>	on top is the list i have and down what i need
<karstenk>	level2 is children of level1 and so on
<l403>	kermit: so you have a tree?
<chchjesus>	karstenk: oh, it looks like you're dealing with json
<adam007>	chchjesus: how can i open python interpreter ?
<l403>	python -i
<chchjesus>	^
<karstenk>	no it is a responsedataobject a dict from xml response
<chchjesus>	oh
<codetaku>	karstenk: are you sure you want to do this?  whatever you are going to do with the output after you transform this into a single frankendict would almost certainly be easier the way things are
<adam007>	try it.. got error file <stdin> line 1 import udemy-dl and there is arrow goes to dash in udemy-dl
<codetaku>	python module names can't have dashes.. and udemy-dl is an executable command anywho
<codetaku>	are you sure it is supposed to work on windows adam007 ?
<karstenk>	codetaku  as result i wanted to iterate over that tree to create new records to my db. the problem is, the callback of create is the new id of that record, which have to be stored for using to create children.
<adam007>	ahh.. i didn't ask it to my friend.. he use kali anyway..
<codetaku>	karstenk: what do you mean by "the callback of create"?
<karstenk>	the return value is id of new record, which is created
<codetaku>	by id, do you mean categoryid?
<karstenk>	that id i have to use to create children with value parent_id=id
<karstenk>	no uid of record, a new one not in the list before
<karstenk>	the id represented in the response list, is the ebay internal id
<karstenk>	alsa the parnet_id
<karstenk>	i cant write the ebay_id as id in my database cause of constrains
<codetaku>	it seems to me that you would be best off by build a dict that maps categoryid values to the records
<dpn`>	re.escape is... really bad
<karstenk>	that i ask for all day
<yaw>	dpn` why?
<codetaku>	karstenk: something like for record in response_list:  thedict[record['categoryid']] = record
<karstenk>	codetaku http://pastebin.com/vbvvuz7q
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/yd4oks4zf7ob4950bin8/ (repasted for karstenk)
<karstenk>	nodes is like i need, but it works only for 2 level, the third level not searches in children, i need a dynamically index or something like that
<karstenk>	the last 4 lines does not work
<karstenk>	cause the level not referencing
<codetaku>	karstenk: i don't understand why you are trying to make this into a tree.  if you want the children of a category (do you ever actually need this?), just pull out all the records where parentcategoryid=the category you're looking at,
<codetaku>	and what does the "levellimit=2" parameter you set on line 17 do?
<karstenk>	it says, iam a children of an element next to me, with level 1
<jim>	ok, now i do need it... so range(3) gives [0,1,2], how to reverse that?
<dadaas>	(12:40:47) yhg1s: dadaas: driver.find_elements_by_xpath returns a list. presumably a list of elements. you can't call the 'text' method on a list, because it has no such method. perhaps you want to iterate over the list of elements and call the 'text' method of the items. (can someone explain in more details, so what i really need to do? loop trough the list and how to call text on each of it? what command i need to use?)
<karstenk>	thats why a list cannot help to write new records in reference to its parents
<codetaku>	jim: reversed(range(3))
<jim>	ok
<karstenk>	is my english really so worst that you cant understand?
<codetaku>	karstenk: i am recommending a dict keyed on categoryid, not a list
<karstenk>	what should be the difference? i can not create my records from a list or a flat dict
<codetaku>	dadaas: what do you want to do, just concatenate all of the items text attributes?
<codetaku>	karstenk: why can't you?  you have an id for each record, and each record has the id of its parent.
<karstenk>	no it hasnt
<codetaku>	in the data you showed, each record has a parentcategoryid field
<karstenk>	they have all only ebay internal idś, they not know the id of there parents, first when a parent is created!"
<dadaas>	yes i have scrape a list of proxies so i wish to append all of them to a file, but i think first i need to grab all of them and make a lsit fromt hem?
<yhg1s>	dadaas: it's hard to say without knowing what you want to do with the result. a for loop is probably what you want to use, but perhaps you want a list comprehension instead. both of those are covered in any python tutorial
<codetaku>	karstenk: 'first when a parent is created'?  you are creating new categories, but not creating them with ebay (so you don't have an ebay id for them)?
<dadaas>	yea i know commands, but i think i dont understand how all of this data that is scraped works. well in longer version i would like to add proxies as list in a file, but i would be happy if i somehow can print a lsit of proxies just to verify to my self that this code works
<pycoderf>	is there a way to keep virtualenv from doing a full install of python in each directory? i am making a web server that will run a bunch of flask apps. i may end up just installing it system wide in this case
<dadaas>	and as youa lready notices i m very new to python codinf
<codetaku>	dadaas: thelist = [element.text() for element in driver.find_elements_by_xpath()] might be in the neighborhood of what you want?
<dadaas>	proxy = driver.find_elements_by_xpath("/html/body/section/section[4]/section[1]/div/table/tbody/tr/td[2]") #so with this line i created a list inside proxy variable, so list is there and i just need to extract it?
<codetaku>	pycoderf: unless you tell virtualenv to create actual copies, it only actually creates symlinks, so it looks like a separate python install but isn't really
<dadaas>	i see, thanks let me try and see that
<pycoderf>	codetaku: so for my use case it is ok to use when everythign will run on the same python and flask version?
<ztane>	jinja2 uses an ugly hack to detect whether python is built with 32- or 64-bit pyssize_t: it looks if hasattr(ctypes.pythonapi, 'py_initmodule4_64')
<codetaku>	pycoderf: yes, although it will duplicate the flask files (i believe), it is recommended.. it might save you configuration headaches in the future... now, if these are all actually part of one project, you might want to reconsider separate venvs and perhaps just make one for the whole project which they all share
<ztane>	now, the problem is, such function does not exist in cpython 3 anymore, anyone have an idea how to detect such thing on cpython 3 via ctypes
<pycoderf>	they are separate projects, what would the benefit be of venvs for each using the same stuff?
<tylerdurden01>	(python 3) so, i can't append a new member to an array after declaring it just like in javascript? ( array = []; array.member = "stuff"; )
<mrelendig>	sure you can
<mrelendig>	(you don't declare in python btw)
<codetaku>	pycoderf: the advantange would be that all the different parts of the project would be operating on the same coonfiguration... but if they are separate projects, you probably want them to be able to vary so new projects can use newer versions of flask and the like without worrying about possibly breaking other parts that use the older version
<tylerdurden01>	mrelendig: 'list' object has no attribute 'member'
<mrelendig>	tylerdurden01: http://bit.ly/mcahyx
<papna>	tylerdurden01: lists just don't allow arbitrary attribute assignment
<yaw>	tylerdurden01 that's not how you append to a list
<papna>	tylerdurden01: this is how lists work
<pycoderf>	codetaku: i actually will always ensure they use newest versions
<tylerdurden01>	papna: ok. thanks.
<yaw>	tylerdurden01 also list is not a key-value pair
<codetaku>	tylerdurden01: you don't need a 'member' function, you use indices... if you want named parts you probably want a dict instead of a list
<yaw>	tylerdurden01 array.append(value) appends to the end of the list
<codetaku>	pycoderf: you'll go back through and re-test every code path through every single project whenever there's a new version of flask?
<papna>	tylerdurden01: python works very differently in many ways than javascript.
<papna>	tylerdurden01: http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/
<yaw>	tylerdurden01 if what you want is array.member = value then you need a dictionary
<kosh>	papna, don't name the language that shall not be named ;)
<pycoderf>	considering how small my projects are probably but i see your point
<pycoderf>	venvs it is, except for uwsgi
<yaw>	in javascript array.member doesn't append to the array
<yaw>	tylerdurden01 ^^
<yaw>	it sets the value in the object's hash
<yaw>	that's how cheap memoization is done in javascript: setting values in the object's accompanying hash
<jonreed>	why do some function signatures in scipy have curly brackets in them? e.g. "scipy.signal.cspline2d(input {, lambda, precision}) → ck". if i understand correctly square brackets usually mean optional parameters. for example, "x, [out]" means that "out" parameter is optional.  what is the difference between curly and square brakets and why do some people prefer to write it in such way to begin with, instead of a more simple "x, out
<jonreed>	here is an example: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.cspline2d.html#scipy.signal.cspline2d
<codetaku>	jonreed: i take it you're referring to documentation?  maybe scipy thought using square brackets could confuse people since square brackets are used as list constructors in python?  (although curly braces with tuples inside is the set constructor...)
<codetaku>	actually, now that i think of it, {params} makes more sense for named parameters since their order actually does not matter and duplicates are an error...
<papna>	yaw: maybe!
<jonreed>	codetaku: yes, i'm referring to documentation. but to me both square and curly brackets were confusing and a more simple "x, out=none" would be more understanble (i think the same is true for other people as well). numpy uses a lot of square brackets and numpy is usually used in combination with scipy. e.g. most ufuncs in numpy have square bracket notation like http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.add.html#nump
<codetaku>	jonreed: you make valid points
<kosh>	overall they should just use the same format for documentation that matlab uses
<kosh>	i still have not run into an environment as productive as matlab for numerical problems
<codetaku>	kosh: does matlab have the same conventions as python with [] being a list constructor, named parameters, etc?
<kosh>	[] is a list construct but not for indexing
<kosh>	however slicing in matlab is more flexible than what numpy can do
<codetaku>	how so?
<kosh>	you can do multidimensional slices easily where all the dimensions are conditions
<kosh>	so far in numpy all the methods i have seen to do that are clunkier and multiple steps
<kosh>	i would not use matlab as a general purpose programming environment though
<kosh>	and if you code everything in c you will get faster performence at the cost of numerical stability unless you are very careful
<amun_ra>	check out julia language for numerical calculations
<codetaku>	also at the cost of slower development time, slower maintenance and/or extension, etc
<kosh>	hehe
<kosh>	no
<brauminski>	e
<brauminski>	eoau
<brauminski>	e
<kosh>	i keep seeing people suggest julia, actually look at using it carefully
<kosh>	when i looked about 9 months ago the stiff ode solver was numerically unstable in several open bug reports
<kosh>	it was much faster than matlab at solving stiff odes incorrectly
<kosh>	industry standard for ode solving is sundials which a lot of stuff uses, it is pretty much as fast as you can get in general and still keep stability
<papna>	kosh: slicing in numpy is really a little more featureful
<papna>	kosh: it just works a bit different
<kosh>	so far i have not run into any slices in numpy that i could not do in matlab
<kosh>	although i did get pissed off once that an array all 0 and 1 and the same size as the array did not work like an array of bools does
<kosh>	that was a pain to debug
<ic2000>	if python has automatic garbage collection what is the point of del?
<pycoderf>	what user do you guys dev flask applications as? root and then chown them?
<asdf`>	ic2000, `del x` removes the name x; when all the names pointing to a value are removed, the value might be garbage collected, when python feels like it; del doesn't by itself remove a value from memory, and in particular doesn't cause __del__ to be called
<amun_ra>	ic2000: https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__
<asdf`>	amun_ra, no, `del x` doesn't have to do with __del__
<amun_ra>	asdf`: i misread the question :/
<asdf`>	ic2000, it's not very useful, other than perhaps removing things from dicts
<ic2000>	oh okay ty
<kosh>	ic2000, sometimes you need to remove something sooner than it would be collected automatically
<kosh>	ic2000, if you have a matrix that is uses up 10gb of ram then you might want to remove it when you are done instead of waiting for it to go out of scope and get collected
<ic2000>	ohh i see, also would this be the same? https://bpaste.net/show/9bb9dd2612b6
<kosh>	in both cases x=10 is going to be collected immediately so del is pointless
<pycoderf>	can someone explain the difference between workon_home and project_home in venv wrapper?
<kosh>	imagine you where creating large matrixes in a function and needed to remove ones you no longer needed or you would run out of memory
<jonreed>	ic2000: or if it's in the global scope, it will never be collected to begin with untill execution ends / you quit, because it does not know whether you might decide to use that object in the next statement or not. if i understand correctly, it will garbage collect object only when they are either out of scope (reference count reaches 0) or after they are manually deleted. reference count will not auto reach 0 in the global namespac
<tylerdurden01>	for the latest version of python, i should use urllib for retrieving files?
<jim>	owencook :p
<nedbat>	jonreed: objects are only reclaimed when their reference count reaches zero.  there is no "manually deleted".  del simply removes a reference, not a value
<jonreed>	jim: pickup by night, program by day.
<jim>	you got the ref :p
<jonreed>	nedbat: i mean that del will remove a name from a global namespace, would it not? and if before that the ref count was 1, then it will be garbage collected eventuall. but if there is something else referencing object, then it still will exist, even after del. i'm not sure about that though.
<nedbat>	jonreed: that is right.  the way you said it earlier sounded different
<docmors>	nedbat, if del only deletes the reference how would you delete an object
<nedbat>	docmors: you can't directly delete a value.
<kosh>	if there is only one reference then it would cause it to be deleted
<jonreed>	nedbat: yeah i should have said, "sometimes the only way to make ref count 0 before the execution ends is to use del"
<docmors>	nedbat, can i retrieve a list of references to a given object?
<nedbat>	docmors: no, it isn't recorded
<kosh>	a reference may not even have a name
<kosh>	ie a list of list that has a refernce to your object
<docmors>	nedbat, thanks
<yhg1s>	docmors: you can ask the gc module for the list of references *it* knows about, but it would be a subset.
<omarlittle>	hey. i have a question. i have coordinates like (x,y,z). z is gonna be 0 or 1, depend on another function. x and y are real coordinates. so i want to make a function which finds the z part of the coordinates from the map, when x and y given. i did this, but i have a feeling that this is a bit overkill. so, is there a better, easier function, maybe a built-in one, for this? http://pastebin.com/xggr2mwy
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/f4fieh6nz9fti7dxtui5/ (repasted for omarlittle)
<kosh>	and if you want to screw up your program really badly play with the gc system
<docmors>	yhg1s, thanks i guess i'll just use proper programming to prevent wastage.
<kosh>	docmors, in general you can ignore it since variables in function go out of scope when the function ends and they are collected
<docmors>	yes i'm not really asking for my code but every now and then you find a gobal in inherited code ...
<omarlittle>	my method works btw, but i'm not sure about it's performance friendliness.
<kosh>	omarlittle, why not directly iterate over your list of coordinates and stop when they match coord1 and coord2?
<kosh>	that would be linear at least
<kosh>	if you want higher performance you need a better data structure
<kosh>	i would make a set of all the items are that 1 and another for all the items that are 0
<asdf`>	omarlittle, hmm! what other operations are there to perform? instead you could use a dict like {(x,y): [z]}
<kosh>	then you only do tests for a tuple in the set
<kosh>	that would be close to o(1)
<codetaku>	omarlittle: if (coord0, coord1, 0) in self.vr.maps: return (coord0, coord1, 0) else: return (coord0, coord1, 1) ?
<kosh>	hmm yeah i guess since it can't be in both a straight dict would be better
<kosh>	codetaku, cleaner code but still o(n)
<codetaku>	you could probably use filter() too
<kosh>	that would still be o(n)
<omarlittle>	all are brilliant ideas. thanks guys. i'm a bit new. i think codetaku's tip, i can do more easily with this code. thanks all:)
<kosh>	the dictionary is the best approach so far
<codetaku>	kosh: why?  tuples are hashable aren't they?
<kosh>	codetaku, i was thinking of his current list, if he turns it into a dictionary then it would be o(1) pretty much
<codetaku>	oh, yeah, with maps just being a list it would have to fall back to a linear search
<omarlittle>	i wish i could understand those.
<omarlittle>	is this gonna be a really performance hit, if i do this way
<omarlittle>	it's just a simple pathfinding thing
<asdf`>	omarlittle, depends! how long would maps be typically?
<codetaku>	how big is maps?
<omarlittle>	uh, not so big. maybe 20x20
<asdf`>	so, 400?
<kosh>	it depends on how big maps is and how often you do this
<kosh>	if you do this several million times per seconds then lots of stuff adds up
<codetaku>	you won't notice any performance problems on a set of data that small... computers are fast
<omarlittle>	but, say, 10 or 20 objects will find path
<omarlittle>	oh then, no problem right
<pycoderf>	is it acceptable to do dev root while logged in as root?
<omarlittle>	enough to think small for now:)
<kosh>	you mean develop software as root?
<omarlittle>	thanks guys
<pycoderf>	kosh: yeah i am starting to setup my development environment
<asdf`>	omarlittle, btw, don't do `for i in range(len(l)): l[i]`, it's better to simply do `for e in l: e` instead
<kosh>	pycoderf, don't do that as root ever
<codetaku>	i gotta go with kosh on this one
<pycoderf>	ok fair enough
<kosh>	a bug in your program that deletes a directory could end up deleting the os
<pycoderf>	time to then be ready to chown files when moving to prod, which should nto be a big deal
<pycoderf>	thanks
<kosh>	that is like playing russian roulette with an rpg
<omarlittle>	thanks asdf'. those tips helps a lot:)
<codetaku>	proper development involves doing dangerous things all over the place, you need all the protection you can get
<kosh>	i like to develop in a vm :)
<pycoderf>	yeah i am devving in a vm with a generic user
<codetaku>	you use vagrant kosh?
<cosmopanda>	hi everyone :)
<kosh>	you can screw up bad in that and still be okay
<pycoderf>	but that is fine as nobody has access to this box
<kosh>	codetaku, nope
<codetaku>	cosmopanda: good morning
<kosh>	cosmopanda, greetings lifeform
<jim>	i have class a(b1, b2): an
<pycoderf>	so when i am done writing my code in the venv just copy it to the document root of the web server
<codetaku>	pycoderf: actually your code should probably not live in the document root... that's for files that the web server are actually going to send to clients
<pycoderf>	so what would be a good organization for the files?
<pycoderf>	tutorials i ahve seen put it all in the same place
<jim>	i have class a(b1, b2): and when i needed to make sure b2.__init__ was called, someone said if b1.__init__ doesn't call super().__init__, b2.__init__ couldn't be called... what if b1 has an __init__ but b2 does not?
<omarlittle>	asdf' ?
<jonreed>	developing as root is fun, especially using bash "rm -rf /usr /lib/nvidia-current/xorg/xorg"
<jonreed>	ups guys sry forgot a space.
<jonreed>	""rm -rf /usr /lib/nvidia-current/xorg/xorg"
<codetaku>	for development that's ok, but for production use you should put your .py files and such in a directory outside the document root, somewhere locked down to access by the user the web server process itself runs under
<pycoderf>	and then just do all my links to the docroot?
<jonreed>	"rm -rf /usr/lib/nvidia-current/xorg/xorg"* i hope you backed your used directory
<jim>	jonreed, tell that to ##linux
<codetaku>	pycoderf: if your code is linking to static files, yes
<pycoderf>	what is a good place to put the code files?
<nedbat>	jim: why doesn't it have __init__ ?
<asdf`>	omarlittle, what's up?
<jim>	well it did because there was something to do there, but that thing no longer needs to be done
<codetaku>	pycoderf: that can depend on what web server you're using and how you have it configured
<pycoderf>	nginx with uwsgi
<nedbat>	jim: i think you will be ok.  are yous ure you want to use multiple inheritance?
<codetaku>	do you have an nginx user?
<omarlittle>	yeah alright asdf' i did it. for (x,y,z) in maps: didn't work out first, but i managed it like, for c in range(0,2): if (x,y,z) in maps: anyways, thanks again:)
<jim>	it fits exactly the use case i have
<asdf`>	omarlittle, hmm, the former should work as well, but the latter sure is nicer
<omarlittle>	okay, thanks:)
<nedbat>	jim: what use case is that?
<pycoderf>	can anyone tell me why this not creating the scirpts/.virtualenv directory and complains is canot find a module named virtualenvwrapper https://bpaste.net/show/3a76aad2b542
<jim>	a small addition called commandtarget that makes the d class be a commandtarget. it receives commands from itself or from other objects in the form of the calling of the method docommand
<pycoderf>	oh i had to log out and back in
<kulelu88>	i'm trying to make my app persist/keep-running after it does its task and then cycle back, but when i use this while loop: "while "exit" != true: ..." it causes the app to run forever
<jim>	kulelu88, you're comparing a string to a constant
<wild_cat>	kulelu88: "exit" != true will *always* be true.
<wild_cat>	kulelu88: what you actually want to do is have a variable called running, that starts out as true, and that something in your loop can set to false.
<wild_cat>	then your loop should be 'while running: # do stuff'. once running becomes false, the loop exits
<jim>	kulelu88, because you're comparing a string ("exit") to a constant (true)
<kulelu88>	jim, wild_cat: i changed it to this: https://pastee.org/ravj8
<pycoderf>	i am still confused where my code should live
<wild_cat>	kulelu88: two things. line 8 doesn't do anything -- it compares exa to the constant false and discards the result
<kulelu88>	pycoderf: what do you mean?
<wild_cat>	kulelu88: == is comparison, = is assignment
<kulelu88>	oops, so exa= false. noob error sorry
<wild_cat>	kulelu88: furthermore, the == true at line 6 is unnecessary.
<wild_cat>	just use 'while exa: # do something'
<pycoderf>	someone said dont put my .py files in my doc root. i am unsure where they should live otherwise
<jim>	so then you run the loop once
<kulelu88>	okay so i got it to stop going into a forever loop, but the script still exits upon completion. should i assign exa= true after the while loop?
<kulelu88>	pycoderf: what are you trying to do? run python files on your system? you can have python files run anywhere (almost) on your system
<codetaku>	pycoderf: sorry, i had to go afk for a few... personally i usually put such files in the home directory of the web server user (my user is www, a common choice for apache servers)
<jim>	the loop should set the var false when you want to exit
<jim>	it's a typical pattern
<kulelu88>	jim: i want to cycle back to the function after i am done. i don't want the script to exit but to keep running all the time after a task is done
<pycoderf>	codetaku: and then point your doc root where the static stuff is? does the vhost then point at the homedir or the docroot
<pycoderf>	i am also still confused by workon_home and project_home with virtualenv wrapper
<jim>	do you call it a function because it returns a value?
<codetaku>	pycoderf: i am not fully confident that the way i do things is the "right way", but i use /var/www as the document root
<pycoderf>	and then /home/www for your code?
<commonoddity>	hello. looking for some help on getting around a key error. i've been trying to re-work the following script (i grabbed it from online, credited at the top accordingly): https://bpaste.net/show/803cf723dc42
<codetaku>	yes, setting that as wsgipythonpath in the .conf file
<pycoderf>	hm ok i guess i can check it out. does it hurt to have code int he doc root? and can you help wth my evenv question
<codetaku>	commandoline: what is the key it fails to find?
<kulelu88>	jim: what is happening in the while loop is that i give it some input and it returns some output to me (a string in this case)
<commonoddity>	effectively, trying to use /np (now playing) command in xchat to print the current song information. problem is that the method being called pulls up a series of metadata information in the style of a dictionary. when all fields are populated, everything works as it should. the second you try to print a key such as 'artist' that is not populated, a key error crops up.
<codetaku>	pycoderf: it doesn't 'hurt' but it could lead to a security issue if your web server allows users to download your python source by specifying the .py file directly
<rivarun>	hello. pylint inside a virtualenv warns about import errors when it shouldn't. how would i go about amending this?
<codetaku>	pycoderf: as for the virtualenv question, i don't know, i've never run into those environment variables..
<jim>	so you don't want to run the func once... and you don't want to run it forever...
<commonoddity>	i imagine this is expected behavior per python- but i've been wrestling (after much googling) with creating a clause that checks whether the key will even exist in the first place before attempting anything. is there a way to possibly do this against a dbus method for clementine? i apologize ahead of time if what i type seems like jargon. i am somewhat new at this.
<pycoderf>	im using the wrapper to make it easier to manage
<codetaku>	commonoddity: what would you prefer to happen?  an empty string be returned?
<pycoderf>	google is no help
<jim>	how do you know when you want to exit?
<commonoddity>	codetaku: yes, if possible. i'm just not sure if this is possible against the getmetadata method that is used with clementine/dbus
<codetaku>	ah, i played with the wrapper once but never got into the habit of using it, i usually create mine manually or else create one inside pycharm
<codetaku>	commonoddity: give me a second to look at your code
<commonoddity>	thank you kindly for your time
<pycoderf>	the wrapper simplifies it. you dont have to source fullpath you can workon name
<kulelu88>	jim
<kulelu88>	jim: i want it to be an app that stays "open" for as long as i want to use it and when i am done, i can exit it
<commonoddity>	codetaku: not sure how familiar you are with any of this, but i will send you a link or two that i've used as reference trying to figure this stuff out. it just doesn't have quite the information i am looking for
<codetaku>	commonoddity: ok, i was going to recommend using a defaultdict but since you're getting the dict back from a function that's not really an option... you can, however, do "if 'artist' in clemmd:" and key off of that
<cast>	i'd like to add the values of a dictionary (d) together, they're all the same unspecified type. what do people think of this, i'm wondering if i've overcomplicated things: starting_key = next(iter(d)); total = d.pop(starting_key); for value in d.values(): total += value
<jim>	you could try something like daemontools
<pycoderf>	codetaku: i could just deny access to the .py files directly
<commonoddity>	odd. i tried that and it still barfed up the error. i will try once more, mayhaps i missed the quotation marks
<nedbat>	cast: you can use sum(d.values())   if your values are ok being added to 0
<codetaku>	cast:  rather than the for loop, just use total = sum(d.values())
<codetaku>	cast: although... you are depending upon the starting key being the first thing returned by the iterator, and you can't do that.. dicts do not have an ordering
<cast>	i did look at sum, appears to be numeric values only though, i'd like to add strings too
<nedbat>	cast: reduce(operator.add, d.values())   # ?
<cast>	codetaku: thats a good point, i was ignoring ordering - which would be a problem for non-numbers [theres a word for that...]
<cast>	nedbat: ahh nice, i hadn't thought of that!
<codetaku>	cast:  why are you using a dict?  because you're very much treating it like a list
<commonoddity>	codetaku: unfortunately i got another error message. would it be alright if i were to print it to you in private?
<commonoddity>	err, s/print/paste
<nedbat>	it's disappointing that sum is hard to use on other types, and that it refuses to work on strings
<codetaku>	commonoddity: sure, though you might get more help if you ask in here, my knowledge is by no means endless
<jim>	kulelu88, so the exit condition does not depend on the function, in any way. yes?
<pc_>	i've set up swgi, apache, and flask on my server, but the directories contents are displayed instead of my page
<pc_>	 /project
<pc_>	what's wrong?
<commonoddity>	if anyone else has an idea of how to get around this issue, i would be grateful by all means.
<cast>	codetaku: its an exercise question, write a function that adds an arbitrary number of keyword arguments, the previous exercise was add an arbitrary number of positional arguments :)
<kulelu88>	okay i got it to persist using numbers and if/else checks
<pc_>	i've set up wsgi, apache, and flask on my server, but the directories contents are displayed instead of my intended page
<codetaku>	pc_:  apache and flask?  i've never used flask, but doesn't it run its own server process?
<kulelu88>	so after it completes the task, it cycles back to option "0", which is the main/settings page
<pc_>	codetaku: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/deploying/mod_wsgi/
<codetaku>	pc_: ah, ok... well then my guess would be the problem lies with your apache config... did you restart apache after editing the virtualhost entries?
<pc_>	yesh
<pc_>	yes*
<kulelu88>	jim: not that i can think of. you just select your option, it does the work and then goes back to the options. i will try to improve it with error-checking, but for now i am trying to get the structure
<pc_>	codetaku:    wsgidaemonprocess logger user=user1 group=group1 threads=5
<pc_>	do i change user, group, and threads?
<pc_>	maybe that's it
<codetaku>	unfortunately, apache configuration scares me, so i might not be much help
<pc_>	codetaku any idea what i could send user and group to
<codetaku>	in my experience it is obtuse and fragile, like a house of cards on the back of a turtle
<codetaku>	pc_: nope, sorry... are those os users and groups?  or perhaps accounts held by flask?
<pc_>	i think os users and groups
<jim>	kulelu88, so would you really have use for the function that runs multiple times? or does it only need to run once and come back to rest (to the menu or to exit entirely from python)
<codetaku>	probably www (or maybe www-data... whoever runs apache on your system)
<anddam>	anyone with 3 minutes spare and bitbucket account?
<pc_>	ook
<kulelu88>	jim: the function that runs is supposed to only do so once, complete its work and then go back to a normal state where i can use it again without doing "python app.py". i seem to have it working properly now :)
<jim>	so it's a menu like structure
<kulelu88>	using bool checks wasn't as logical to me as using variables and numbers (eg. exa = 1, exa = 2)
<kulelu88>	yeah jim, basically its like that. now i can add features per menu option. so option 2 will do something, option 3, option 4, etc.
<mssbrg>	if i have a test script in a test/ dir, how can it import the actual module which is at the same level as test/ if imports can't have .. or paths?
<kulelu88>	mssbrg: you can put that module in the python global directory
<codetaku>	mssbrg: imports can have .. at least in python 3 (not sure about 2)... like "import ..test"
<codetaku>	although, you say they're at the same level?  "import .test" then
<tylerdurden01>	how do i check if a string contains a word, but not a perfect match?
<anddam>	tylerdurden01: define "contains"
<kulelu88>	tylerdurden01: perfect match?
<mssbrg>	kulelu88: what is the python global directory?
<tylerdurden01>	anddam: i have a really big string and i want to check if it has the word "apple", but not fail the whole string isn't the exact word "apple"
<tylerdurden01>	anddam: *not fail if the
<mssbrg>	tylerdurden01: fuzzy hashing maybe
<codetaku>	tylerdurden01: if 'apple' in bigstring
<kulelu88>	mssbrg: this is where python is installed. if you find it, you will find all the libs installed via pip in a folder inside there
<tylerdurden01>	codetaku: still doesn't work
<tylerdurden01>	i know for sure that it's in there, but it still doesn't work
<codetaku>	tylerdurden01: what error do you get?
<mssbrg>	kulelu88: but if the actual module is the project i'm working on, i feel like that doesn't belong in the core pythong install directory?
<codetaku>	it returns false?
<tylerdurden01>	codetaku: yes
<kulelu88>	correct mssbrg . my way is the hack way of doing it, but i think codetaku answered you with the better way
<codetaku>	'apple' does not exist in your big string then... is it a single big string, not a list of strings or anything?
<kulelu88>	tylerdurden01: i'
<kulelu88>	tylerdurden01: i
<kulelu88>	woops
<tylerdurden01>	codetaku: i'm iterating over a list of strings before checking each of them for the word
<kulelu88>	tylerdurden01: i think python can't handle cases implicitly, so apple != apple
<codetaku>	kulelu88 is correct, apple and apple are not the same thing... do you need to do a case-insensitive search?
<prs>	tylerdurden01: you can do something like if 'apple' in bigstring.lower()
<tylerdurden01>	codetaku: the word in the string is lowercase as is my word
<kulelu88>	tylerdurden01: show us your code: pastee.org
<codetaku>	took the words right out of my mouth kulelu88 ;)
<kulelu88>	:d
<tylerdurden01>	kulelu88: https://pastee.org/yt6b3
<codetaku>	tylerdurden01: presuming that video['html'] returns a string, 'file: ' does not exist in any of the strings in that list
<tylerdurden01>	codetaku: impossible as i'm grepping the output when i print each item and it shows
<codetaku>	are you certain that video['html'] is a list of strings?  and that the exact sequence of characters is 'file: ' and not 'file:' or  'file: ' or 'file:<tab>'?
<felqer>	anyone having experience with the multiprocessing package? i am wondering how dependent two processes are of each other. if something goes wrong in one of them, which results in the process being terminated, will the other process also be terminated?
<codetaku>	it would be weird for video['html'] to be a list of strings... you might want "if 'file: ' in video['html']" instead... it being a string rather than list of strings would make more sense unless this is perhaps a dictionary you built (and not the output from some function that gives you the full html of a page in one string which is what it sounds like)
<anddam>	tylerdurden01: "doesn't work" doesn't really mean a thing
<anddam>	oh pastebin
<anddam>	tylerdurden01: sscce.org
<mssbrg>	is it bad form to have multiple asserts in a test function?
<anddam>	tylerdurden01: the issue here is that you didn't show a reproducible example so people have to mine information out of you one bit a time
<anddam>	codetaku: could be some beautifulsoup output and video['html'] be the whole html doc
<codetaku>	anddam: that is my expectation
<anddam>	someone alive and kicking with a bitbucket account and 2 spare minutes?
<anddam>	c'mon be part of this
<tylerdurden01>	anddam: video['html'] is a beautifulsoup.find_all() result
<codetaku>	i'd help out anddam but i don't have a bitbucket account.. i use github
<anddam>	tylerdurden01: paste a reproducible example, i.e. a file that anyone can fetch, execute and get the same error
<tylerdurden01>	anddam: nevermind. i'll solve it myself. :)
<anddam>	tylerdurden01: what do you expect anyone to say? you don't have that substring, that's it. the script works fine but it doesn't do what you wanted
<codetaku>	tylerdurden01: now we're getting somewhere... so in the code you didn't show us, you have "video['html'] = soup.findall(...)"?
<anddam>	tylerdurden01: now you should reveal the magician's trick
<codetaku>	or do you have 'video = soup.findall()'?
<codetaku>	this problem could probably have been solved in 30 seconds if you'd pasted the whole file you're working on... and i promise i wouldn't knock on you for scraping pornhub
<tylerdurden01>	codetaku: lol
<tylerdurden01>	codetaku: ok, get ready for some nasty code-induced headaches :p
<codetaku>	that's fine, i consider all code to be 'in development' ;)
<tylerdurden01>	codetaku: http://sprunge.us/xnej
<jim>	(i'm trying to get rid of my __init__s...) can i check to see if self.foo exists?
<tylerdurden01>	codetaku: trying to make a video downloader for some stupid website as practice :d
<vgr>	jim: hasattr(self, "foo") ?
<jim>	ok
<riderplus>	vgr what's that?
<vgr>	riderplus: what's what?
<riderplus>	hasattr(self, "foo")
<vgr>	it checks if "foo" is an attribute of self
<vgr>	i.e. it checks if self.foo exists
<codetaku>	tylerdurden01: try using video['html'].content in your 'for' line
<riderplus>	i always wondered what foo and bar really are
<vgr>	they're just names
<riderplus>	for what?
<jim>	well there's fubar
<vgr>	they're used a lot as dummy names
<riderplus>	jim fubar?
<vgr>	when you need a filler
<codetaku>	riderplus: i believe they are descendants of fubar... f..d up beyond all recognition, a military-oorigin term
<vgr>	you use foo, bar, baz, etc
<riderplus>	codetaku ok thanks
<jim>	"f***ed up beyond all recognition"
<tylerdurden01>	codetaku: nope, error message saying that there's no content
<riderplus>	vgr so you can use anything instead of "foo" and "bar"
<vgr>	riderplus: sure
<riderplus>	ok
<vgr>	riderplus: foo and bar are used to say "hey, any name can go here, but since i don't have any to give as an example, have this placeholder"
<jim>	hopefully something that means something when you read it
<rivarun>	language introductory tutorial: "we will write a small interpreter for the brainfuck language". how about we do something useful instead
<vgr>	or, in python, spam and eggs :)
<riderplus>	it's like an universal language for dummies
<riderplus>	i see
<riderplus>	rivarun haha yeah sounds good
<vgr>	rivarun: a brainfuck interpreter is fun
<vgr>	maybe not all that useful, but fun
<riderplus>	i'm trying to prevent a foobar shitstorm
<rivarun>	vgr: i don't suspect it will tell me all about how the language interacts with the world around it though
<vgr>	rivarun: one step at a time
<riderplus>	no that's philosophy alright
<vgr>	i've been coding in python for years and yet i can't sockets to save my life
<vgr>	s/can't/can't do/
<rivarun>	well, you see, the tutorial is about nim. i would expect him to try to sell the language instead of push some bytes around. but maybe i'm rushing into conclusions
<riderplus>	nim?
<rivarun>	the latest hipster language
<vgr>	python > * :>
<rivarun>	oh. what am i doing in #python
<rivarun>	darn.
<vgr>	haha
<riderplus>	i wanna learn that :p
<rivarun>	sorry all.
<vgr>	it's fine
<riderplus>	it's fine...everything is juuuust fine
<vgr>	i was gonna show you my own (bad) interpreter, but since it's not even python :p
<eburitus>	could someone point me referenve/tutorial or something which explains "__main__"
<vgr>	wrote that in spare time, it "just works"
<vgr>	eburitus: __main__ is the first module that's loaded by python
<vgr>	eburitus: in the interpreter, __main__ will be the actual interpreter
<riderplus>	eburitus it's pretty hard to understand though
<vgr>	riderplus: uh, not really
<vgr>	it's actually really easy
<riderplus>	vgr tell me
<vgr>	eburitus: when launching a script, __main__ is the file that was launched
<vgr>	read up, i said it all
<vgr>	there really isn't much more to it
<riderplus>	enuff is enough :p
<sternmull>	eburitus: its a string that you see in __name__ if when you inspect it in the "main module" (the script that is run by the interpreter). imported modules have other values in __name__.
<vgr>	that's the name of the first loaded module
<the-compiler>	i wonder how many times __name__ and __main__ get highlighted in here
<riderplus>	it's the main module
<vgr>	the-compiler: probably too many :p
<riderplus>	hahaha indeed
<sternmull>	eburitus: https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/__main__.html
<riderplus>	what's that conditional doing? does it equal the name with the "main" file?
<codetaku>	tylerdurden01: ok, i figured it out after some poking around... find_all returns a list, but not of strings, of tag objects
<vgr>	riderplus: it checks if the module's __name__ is __main__, in which case it means it was run as a script (and not imported)
<riderplus>	vgr that makes a lot more sense now
<vgr>	this allows one to make a script with side-effects that only trigger when the module is launched directly, and not imported
<codetaku>	you can't use 'in' on them directly, you want to work with the tag.text member, so change your code to do 'file: ' in script.text
<vgr>	this is mainly used as a self-test thing
<sternmull>	the condition is used to execute some block of code only if the file is used as "main-file" and not when it is imported. this way you can have a blah.py that can be used as standalone tool "python blah.py my parameters" or as module from within another script by "import blah". in the second case its __name__ will not be "__main__" and the conditional block will not be executed.
<tylerdurden01>	codetaku: still not working :(
<codetaku>	tylerdurden01: and btw, the requests library is way simpler than how you're using it... try video['link'] = dl.get(video['url'], headers={...})  and then use video['link'].content instead of doing .read()
<tylerdurden01>	codetaku: thanks :)
<codetaku>	tylerdurden01: try printing out the script.text and see if 'file: ' is actually there?
<tylerdurden01>	codetaku: what version of python are you using?
<tylerdurden01>	codetaku: wait, it's working, but now i wanted it to
<tylerdurden01>	codetaku: thanks :)
<codetaku>	tylerdurden01: no problem... and i am using python 3 though i don't believe anything in your script would be different in 2
<jim>	wheres doc on hasattr
<courrier>	hey guys! i'm trying to interface my python code with the "snap!" visual programming language. the principle is simple: the user writes a program in his web browser thanks to blocks, and some blocks allow to communicate with outside world. snap's connectivity to outside world is made of xmlhttprequests.  as a n00b in web techs, i wonder if there is a python module ready-to-use to handle as simple as possible xmlhttprequests? (that would be
<papna>	jim: https://www.google.com/search?q=python+hasattr&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8
<courrier>	(short explanation about snap's connectivity: https://github.com/jmoenig/snap--build-your-own-blocks/blob/master/snap!%20connectivity%20strategy.pdf )
<papna>	jim: never ever use it
<jim>	why not?
<codetaku>	courrier: look into the requests library and the built-in json module
<papna>	jim: (1) because you should know if an attribute exists. (2) because it does the equivalent of `except:` rather than `except attribute error`
<papna>	attributeerror
<jim>	papna, so it's implemented improperly?
<papna>	jim: yes, it's conceptually poor and it's implemented improperly
<papna>	jim: why wouldn't you know if an object had a given attribute?
<jim>	i'm trying to get rid of my __init__,
<papna>	jim: that does not sound like a worthy goal :)
<codetaku>	papna: he has discovered the wild wonderful world of mro
<jim>	www
<papna>	jim: get rid of your inheritance, not your __init__ :)
<riderplus>	^^
<riderplus>	keep your inheritance and work more for __init__ i would say
<codetaku>	that is a good recommendation... it is extremely rare that you actually need multiple inheritance, there's almost always a better way to do what you want
<riderplus>	true
<courrier>	codetaku: at 1st sight, the requests module allow to *perform* requests, does it allow to *answer to* requests as well?
<courrier>	i mean writing a server
<codetaku>	courrier: indeed
<codetaku>	hmm, i don't think it has a server component, like it won't listen on a port for incoming requests, you'd probably want flask or cherrypy or one of those sorts of frameworks for that
<jim>	i guess you look at a request to see what's wanted in response
<john>	hey all
<jim>	that is, the server is built to respond to requests
<john>	does anyone here program professionally - but were more-or-less self taught?
<asdf`>	john, lots of people do, sure
<codetaku>	john: i'd put myself in that category, though i do have a degree in cs i was doing contract software development before that
<john>	yeah, im sure - but question to those people then would be, did there come a point where you said 'i can make money doing this'
<john>	because... i mean... im a programmer - im programmign night and day on this thing - but ive never 'released' anything
<john>	and honestly im scared that im not good enough to ask for money for it
<codetaku>	john: there is a profound amount of really horrid code out there that people got paid to create... it doesn't actually take much to get to that point.  developers are in high demand
<asdf`>	john, why not just try it? i'm sure there's companies around you that are hiring
<codetaku>	you say you've not 'released' anything... but have you 'completed' projects?  not being able to finish a project and just hopping from one to another is a bad habit
<john>	asdf`:  oh sure - but i'd feel like an imposter just applying
<john>	i've been programming in python for nearly 4 years, and i learnt about classes yesterday
<john>	lol
<pc_>	anyone familiar with flask and apache
<john>	first time i needed one - like, couldn't do it with functions
<pc_>	?
<john>	thats why i feel like a shitty programmer, even though i know my code is clean and fast... kinda
<john>	then again, maybe not
<asdf`>	pc_, don't ask to ask, just ask. also there's #pocoo for flask-related questions. also 'x and apache' questions tend to be just apache-related and not x-related at all
<courrier>	codetaku: any other clue/link to the doc explaining servers maybe? ^^
<pc_>	asdf' thank you
<john>	this would be my biggest fear: http://xkcd.org/1513/
<codetaku>	john: most people, in my experience, who work as software developers are just punching a clock.  they don't give a shit about writing good code, only about keeping their ass out of the fire.  if you care, i'd hire you over them any day
<john>	oh, cool :)
<jim>	john, you should probably just apply
<delinquentme>	does __file__ not work when a method containing it is involved through a module?
<codetaku>	embrace being wrong.  being wrong is fantastic.  when you learn you are wrong about something, you never have to be wrong in that way ever again for the rest of your life.  don't let pride screw with you.
<delinquentme>	involved = run
<jim>	and go thru the rest of the process, for one reason to be able to say you did it
<john>	well, i still have a job to do right now, haha - i write scientific code, and it seems the closer i get to finishing the project, the more scared i get that this is going to be a 'real thing' and that it would be good - if someone else had written it :p
<john>	ahah
<jim>	far more important on a team, is to find people who can get along
<codamuse>	codetaku: v. well said
<codetaku>	codamuse: i minored in philosophy... it comes in handy
<codamuse>	:)
<courrier>	codetaku: sorry i had missed your next answer, so "requets" does not allow to writer servers
<codamuse>	i have a brief question before getting back to things...
<codamuse>	i'm reading fluent python and beautiful code right now
<codamuse>	both great books
<codamuse>	anyone have suggestions of similar books to read?
<codamuse>	maybe more python focused
<jim>	courrier, requests are objects that indicate to a server what to serve
<codetaku>	codamuse: it's not python focused, but 'code' is really good
<codetaku>	by charles petzold... and every developer should read 'the mythical man-month'... oldie but a goodie
<autrilla__>	can't you unpack a dict with for key, value in dict?
<darkelement>	hey guys if i have a 2d array i can do [1].append(element), correct?
<desophos>	matthavard: but why isn't self.prop already "child"?
<autrilla__>	python 3
<hiptobecubic>	matthavard, the question is why doesn't  it pick up the class attribute prop on staticchild or raise an attributeerror?
<desophos>	matthavard: in parent.__init__
<matthavard>	desophos: it starts out as "child" when staticchild is *defined* (i think), and then __init__ is called after that
<hiptobecubic>	oh i see
<matthavard>	oh wait i'm an idiot
<hiptobecubic>	there's two calls to staticchild() there
<matthavard>	hold on i
<matthavard>	i'm not sure what i said is right
<mekhami>	autrilla__ for key, value in d.items():
<matthavard>	you know, idk.  sorry desophos
<matthavard>	sorry for possibly misleading anyone
<desophos>	i expected self.prop in parent.__init__ to be "child"
<autrilla__>	mekhami, huh. why the .items?
<desophos>	regardless of whether prop is static or not
<desophos>	but it seems that when prop is static, it doesn't get assigned to the object for some reason? maybe i'm misunderstanding static members in python
<desophos>	ohhhh
<desophos>	yep
<mekhami>	autrilla__ https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=.items#dict.items
<desophos>	duh
<hiptobecubic>	desophos, ?
<matthavard>	actually the comments are incorrect.  assertionerror is thrown on the last line, not the second to last
<matthavard>	i just did it at my own python interpreter (2.7)
<autrilla__>	mekhami, why not make the dict iterable?
<desophos>	sorry matthavard, you're right
<desophos>	i put the comment in the wrong place
<hiptobecubic>	i got the same
<mekhami>	it is iterable autrilla__
<desophos>	staticchild.prop == "child", but staticchild().prop == "parent"
<autrilla__>	is it? how?
<hiptobecubic>	desophos, no.
<matthavard>	yes desophos.  is there a question there?
<desophos>	because staticchild.__init__ doesn't assign prop to self.prop
<mekhami>	autrilla__ it will iterate over the keys
<autrilla__>	oh well
<hiptobecubic>	staticchild().prop != "parent"
<matthavard>	yeah hiptobecubic is right
<mekhami>	autrilla__ https://gist.github.com/mekhami/929344e85574f1e4f05b
<desophos>	hiptobecubic: that's the point
<desophos>	wait
<hiptobecubic>	desophos, ? what?
<desophos>	now i've confused myself
<hiptobecubic>	desophos, at class definition time, the body of the class is executed
<hiptobecubic>	desophos, after that, staticchild.prop == 'child'
<dxiri>	hello everyone, this is driving me crazy, can anyone tell me how do i get the api key value from an environment variable? (see paste) http://pastebin.com/21drzarz
<hiptobecubic>	then parent.__init__ is called
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/jni7qzajod07urx5c1gk/ (repasted for dxiri)
<hiptobecubic>	at that time, self.prop is 'child', as picked up from the class attribute on staticchild
<desophos>	hmm
<desophos>	i tested that code and you're right
<desophos>	hmmmm
<hiptobecubic>	line 3 will be useful actually
<hiptobecubic>	will never be*
<hiptobecubic>	unless for some reason you assigned the empty string to prop
<hiptobecubic>	if you fail to define prop at all then it will be an attributeerror
<desophos>	i thought that that example is exactly what i'm doing in my code
<desophos>	but apparently not!
<hef_>	what happens if i call pyimport_extendinittab after py_initialize?
<hiptobecubic>	basically this is not a good way to initialize classes.
<desophos>	because i do get an attributeerror
<desophos>	let me post the actual code so you can tell me if it's different
<yggdrasil>	can somone help me populate v ariables from a text doc or a csv ?
<mekhami>	yggdrasil show some code :)
<mekhami>	yggdrasil python has a built in csv module
<yggdrasil>	http://pastebin.com/cggdsbvq
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/72d0exhqhwqsrztfu1av/ (repasted for yggdrasil)
<yggdrasil>	i know
<mekhami>	so why not use it?
<hiptobecubic>	whooo nelly
<yggdrasil>	i started dow nthe path. and couldnt fine examples of what i wanted to do.
<hef_>	what is it that you want to do?
<mekhami>	well i'd recommend you go back and convert to the csv module. makes it easy.
<mekhami>	either way
<yggdrasil>	ahh crap i forgot to paste an input file.
<mekhami>	i'd need to see the example input
<yggdrasil>	yea
<yggdrasil>	one sec.
<rhllor>	how can i convert an array like [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] into a number like 123456789
<yggdrasil>	http://pastebin.com/esewkxkm
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/ig72mspzcskbqns8a2q9/ (repasted for yggdrasil)
<papna>	rhllor: that's a list
<vael|work>	mekhami: maybe i'm just reading it badly, but the professor gave some of the code for move and one of the explicit lines he gave was r = -minimax(b, 3 - p, d) # rate the move for this player by negating other player's utility. p ought to be player so i'm not sure what 3 - p was (that line was in the code already)
<papna>	rhllor: sum(digit * 10**i for i, digit in enumerate(yourlist))
<vael|work>	this was in move()
<yggdrasil>	hef_: i jsut want to take that input file and use it to populete those functions.
<rhllor>	papna: sorry python isn't my first language
<papna>	mine neither. :)
<mekhami>	vael|work i really have a hard time understanding his implementation, so i'm not really that helpful for you here :/
<rhllor>	when i put sum(digit * 10**i for i, digit in enumerate([1,2,3])) i get 321
<yggdrasil>	hiptobecubic: you whoo nellying my code?
<mekhami>	yggdrasil you realize line 94 will only be called once, and populated by the last line of your input file?
<mekhami>	yggdrasil should that be indented in the for loop?
<hiptobecubic>	yggdrasil, :)
<yggdrasil>	um...
<yggdrasil>	let me think about that ..
<mekhami>	yggdrasil either way, use the csv module. it has reasons.
<vael|work>	mekhami: ahh fair enough
<mekhami>	vael|work i'd recommend ignoring your professor's implementation, research the minimax algorithm itself (there's tons of material out there on it) maybe read my algorithm, see if you can et a conceptual understanding of what minimax does and how it works
<mekhami>	for instance, the reason it's called minimax =p
<yggdrasil>	it shoudl be called once for each loop in the main loop ? and then the for line below it will be called for as many times as are in the text file ?
<hiptobecubic>	in general i think it's pretty safe to ignore professors' code.
<somelauw>	i like eval for parsing. i can just do: s = r"hello\n"; eval("{}".format(r)) # return "hello\n". is this good practice?
<hiptobecubic>	it's so rarely good
<vael|work>	good idea. tahnks
<yggdrasil>	mekhami: ok i allready started that before i came back to text.
<yggdrasil>	brb.
<simpson>	somelauw: no.
<ssbr_at_work>	somelauw: no
<mekhami>	somelauw no.
<mekhami>	(come on guys join the party.)
<ssbr_at_work>	somelauw: as a rule, you should act as if eval did not exist
<partyjoiner>	somelauw: no
<hiptobecubic>	usually it was written 15 years ago in pascal or something, wasn't reviewed then either, and then directly ported over line for line to make new files for students in whatever language is used for the class
<rhllor>	papna: for what you gave me, i found you'd have to reverse the list before you enumrate it, because when you do the power it would do 0,1,2… instead of the 2,1,0 that you actually nee
<papna>	rhllor: oops, sorry! i thought i'd written that. :)
<somelauw>	it doesn't seem unsafe. as far as i know there is no way to inject code this way. anyway, is there a library or something builtin that can replace eval?
<the-compiler>	somelauw: though i probably don't have to mention it at this point - no
<mekhami>	papna why do it that way in the first place? why does this require math? can't you just join the list items?
<papna>	mekhami: strings can be joined. numbers can be mathed.
<rhllor>	papna thanks
<mekhami>	papna numbers can become strings and then joined =p
<papna>	mekhami: this math is simply how the decimal base works
<papna>	mekhami: you can do this with string manipulation if you want
<mekhami>	but math makes my head hurt!
<mekhami>	strings are always fun. cats play with strings, not with maths.
<the-compiler>	somelauw: what's your goal here? this is just a nameerror (because r is undefined), and when using s it's a syntaxerror because "hello\n" is no valid python code
<nedbat>	somelauw: depending on where the value r came from, it can be very unsafe.
<rhllor>	mekhami if you're gonna iterate it to convert to strings, might as well use that iteration to add the numbers up
<nedbat>	somelauw: http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201206/eval_really_is_dangerous.html
<mekhami>	rhllor i'm just being silly :)
<rhllor>	:)
<mekhami>	nedbat with the shameless self promotion ;)
<nedbat>	mekhami: i will also promote your blog posts
<mekhami>	psh. i promote yours.
<ssbr_at_work>	mekhami: i was trying to think of a witty comment along those lines
<mekhami>	i've probably linked your blog posts as many times as you have. =p
<ssbr_at_work>	like maybe, "man, we sure link ned batchelder's blog posts a lot. i wish he'd join the channel sometime."
<ssbr_at_work>	but it wasn't funny enough :(
<mekhami>	hahah.
<ephexeve>	hey guys
<ephexeve>	anyone familiar with this mongoengine error? https://bpaste.net/show/4ec4df780873
<ephexeve>	what can it be?
<the-compiler>	<nedbat> offby1: the bad part is when i google a problem, and it points me to my own blog....
<the-compiler>	still makes me chuckle :)
<mekhami>	vael|work i just realized, be wary reading/using parts of my algorithm, as it's engineered for 3x3 tic tac toe
<vael|work>	mekhami: yeah, i realized :) the hardcoded combos wouldn't work for me and such, but the basic idea ought to work still
<the-compiler>	ephexeve: value being a tuple, i think
<mekhami>	vael|work you could generate the combos programmatically as well.
<mekhami>	a little more complex, but...
<mekhami>	anyways, off to the bus. good luck
<vael|work>	mekhami: that's what winner(b) is supposed to do. thanks
<vael|work>	hopefully i figure out my bugs
<somelauw>	the-compiler: basically i want to have a string with r"\n" (raw string) and replace the "\\n" with an actual newline and also do that for tab and all other escape things, without possibility for code injection.
<somelauw>	i can do something like string.replace("\\n", "\n").replace("\\t", "\t") but that becomes tedious.
<somelauw>	basically reversing the repr function
<somelauw>	eval does that, but eval is evil and ...
<ssbr_at_work>	somelauw: >>> 'asd\\n'.decode('string-escape')
<ssbr_at_work>	'asd\n'
<ssbr_at_work>	somelauw: the tedious thing is better-defined, though.
<somelauw>	do you mean string-escape is poorly defined?
<somelauw>	when used in decode?
<jim>	when you consider the question of should python have eval, the first thing to notice is there is no option to have unevaluated arguments,,, if there were, eval would make more sence
<ssbr_at_work>	somelauw: i mean it means your escapes are exactly the same as python's, which can hypothetically change in different releases
<eevee>	what?  python /does/ have eval
<somelauw>	and decode is bytes in python3, no?
<hiptobecubic>	python should have eval because "we're all consenting adults here" or whatever it is.
<ssbr_at_work>	somelauw: in python 3 i'm not sure the right way to do this.
<desophos>	hiptobecubic: this is about as close to my actual code as i can get; what's wrong with it? http://hastebin.com/ucatanudab.py
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/ddbtyahzdrpen3hvemru/ (repasted for desophos)
<eevee>	ssbr_at_work somelauw: for transcoding you can do codecs.decode(s, 'string-escape')
<eevee>	which also works in py2
<somelauw>	ssbr_at_work: thanks, that's better than i was almost considering
<hiptobecubic>	desophos, yuckaroo! give me a minute
<ssbr_at_work>	eevee: does that work on unicode objects?
<desophos>	haha ok
<desophos>	i tried removing the abstract bit, still have the problem
<somelauw>	!python: codecs.decode("hello", 'string-escape')
<desophos>	i think it might be something with the inheritance chain?
<somelauw>	lookuperror: unknown encoding: string-escape
<eevee>	ssbr_at_work: yeah, for codecs that support unicode-to-unicode anyway
<yggdrasil>	mekhami you still here ?
<ssbr_at_work>	eevee: i meant string-escape particularly
<ssbr_at_work>	apparently not
<ssbr_at_work>	somelauw: >>> codecs.decode(u'hello\\n', 'unicode-escape')
<ssbr_at_work>	'hello\n'
<ssbr_at_work>	errrrrrr, right, this is python 3, i don't need the u prefix
<eevee>	oh, unicode_escape is str-to-bytes anyway so you don't even need codecs
<colonolgron>	hi, i am currently learning python. and picked myself a small toy project. now i have the first problem, i would ike to use a for loop for a json array object (or how you call that [])
<yggdrasil>	damit
<yggdrasil>	hah i just mad e huge mess of it.
<papna>	colonolgron: in the file, it's a json array. when you have it in your program, you probably have a list
<colonolgron>	i thought something like this should work: for x in range(data["mystuff"]):
<yggdrasil>	so this isnt even close right ?
<yggdrasil>	http://pastebin.com/mycubbxp
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/kb71zmr1aqoo4cu6lajm/ (repasted for yggdrasil)
<papna>	colonolgron: range takes numbers
<colonolgron>	but seems that is wrong. however the error message doesnt help e much :s
<papna>	colonolgron: perhaps you're looking for `for x in data["mystuff"]:`?
<hiptobecubic>	desophos, so why is weight a class attribute?
<papna>	colonolgron: it's always best to pastebin your full code and full traceback
<colonolgron>	papna, ah so i have to use len(data["mystuff"]) ?
<colonolgron>	ahh i see
<hiptobecubic>	on paralyze. i realize you replace it later, which also is really fishy
<colonolgron>	let me check this out :)
<papna>	colonolgron: if you wanted indices, that's one way to get them, but the thing to do is *not* to use indices :)(
<papna>	:)
<desophos>	hiptobecubic: simplicity of syntax, but i can compromise if necessary
<desophos>	hiptobecubic: i just want a default value
<desophos>	which is where the replacement comes from
<hiptobecubic>	desophos, you are trading having any hope of understanding this for "simpliticy of syntax"
<desophos>	haha
<hiptobecubic>	which is why we're still talking about it :)
<desophos>	i guess static is bad
<desophos>	so if i move those static members into __init__ you think it'll fix it? i'll see
<hiptobecubic>	certianly if you're planning on secretly replacing it later
<colonolgron>	papna, yay what you wrote is what i wanted to accomplish! great, thanks! i didnt even know that this is possible
<hiptobecubic>	i think your super classes should not be doing magical things with secret knowledge about their subclasses
<yggdrasil>	ahh i think i got it.
<desophos>	hmm
<frodopwns>	hey guys, i am running into this ssl issue with python 2.7 and was wondeirn gif anyone has a straightforward fix: requests.exceptions.sslerror: hostname 'slack.com' doesn't match u'*.slack.com'
<desophos>	well ideally i'd just guarantee that the subclass defines the members, but that seems hard to do in python
<desophos>	yeah making them non-static fixes it :/ i'd still like to know why though
<yeryry>	frodopwns: are you trying to access slack.com or www.slack.com (or something else)? try the other...
<frodopwns>	using the slacker  lib to post messages to a slack room
<frodopwns>	https://github.com/os/slacker
<frodopwns>	yeryry: so im not actually telling it...i just from slacker import slacker and it uses whatever url it hasd stored
<frodopwns>	api_base_url = 'https://slack.com/api/{api}'
<yeryry>	try changing that to www.slack.com?
<hiptobecubic>	desophos, you can't guarantee anything about subclasses like that without just having the init method directly do a 'hasattr' check and throwing an exception.
<frodopwns>	worth a shot, was hoping to not have to augment what pip installed
<hiptobecubic>	desophos, the superclass is not supposed to be worried about how subclasses work. it's the job of the subclass to make sure it doesn't break the superclass.
<yeryry>	you may be able to just do slacker.api_whatever = whatever?
<igenius>	let's say i'm parsing a xml file and i realized that the text i'm looking for isn't always going to be there. can i put a return statement in a try/except block?
<desophos>	hiptobecubic: could you suggest an alternative in this case?
<hiptobecubic>	desophos, i wasn't very careful with it, but here for example: http://vpaste.net/tyy5h
<frodopwns>	yeryry: good point
<hiptobecubic>	desophos, if you understand the order of execution it's not hard to figure out how it should go
<colonolgron>	i just ran "pip install sh" as root. but when i "import sh" i get "no module named sh", though installation was succesful..
<the-compiler>	colonolgron: are you sure you ran pip for the right python install/version?
<eyess>	so uh
<eyess>	i have a list that's fixed length
<hiptobecubic>	desophos, also note that i call the superclass __init__ methods at the *top* of my init methods rather than the bottom. this makes sure that the object is consistent while i initialize my subclass's part *and* forces the superclass to be standalone.
<eyess>	is there a way to do list[1,3]
<eyess>	or such
<colonolgron>	the-compiler, i am not :s this is all very comlicated. but afaik i have only one python version installed
<yeryry>	eyess: what would you want it to produce?
<colonolgron>	the-compiler, wheni run python --version as root and normal user, i always get "2.7.8"
<hiptobecubic>	desophos, i'll brb
<colonolgron>	the-compiler, you seem to be right, i ran pip again and it sais "requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): sh in /usr/lib/python3.4/site-packages
<colonolgron>	"
<colonolgron>	the-compiler, but why? when i run "python --version" i always get 2.7
<colonolgron>	how comes there is a version 3 installed then? and why does pip install sh vor the version 3?
<the-compiler>	colonolgron: what os are you on?
<introspectr3>	colonolgron: which python
<the-compiler>	colonolgron: my guess is os x and homebrew
<igenius>	help! originally i had this function which was returning a string from an xml document. like "return soup_myprice.find('landedprice').amount.text ". but i realized just now that the field in xml doc may not always be there. so how can i make a try/except statement that will at least return something like "not avail" in that case, and also not cause my program to stop running?
<colonolgron>	the-compiler, opensuse no osx ;) i think i found the mistake. for some reason python 2.7 got installed but python3-pip
<colonolgron>	fixed it :) thanks for the hint the-compiler
<colonolgron>	i went for learning python2, good decision?
<igenius>	how does a try/except statement work? if a line in the try block gets triggered, does it immediately jump to the except block?
<tos9>	igenius: yes.
<tos9>	igenius: (generally try blocks should have exactly 1 line in them.)
<igenius>	for example if i have two lines in the try block - one is a parsing xml and the one below it is a return statement, and the xml parsing line causes an exception, will the return statement below not get executed?
<eyess>	yeryry, list items 1 and 3
<eyess>	in a separate list
<igenius>	tos9, so should i say try: return soup_myprice.find('landedprice').amount.text except: return 'none'  ?
<tos9>	igenius: never bare except (except:).
<igenius>	never put a bare except:?
<igenius>	so what kind of except should i put
<tos9>	but yes, except whateverexceptionisraisedwhenthathappens:, if you'd like.
<igenius>	except typeerror
<igenius>	okay but my question was mainly to address how to return things in an except statement
<tos9>	as you have it.
<the-compiler>	colonolgron: in my opinion, don't learn python2 unless you have a very good reason to - but picking up python3 when you know 2 (or vice versa) will be easy as well
<igenius>	so i can put a return statement in both the try and except
<tos9>	sure. try it and see :).
<igenius>	and you mentioned don't ever put more than one statement in a try block - does it also apply to the except block?
<tos9>	no, in an except block it's fine, have as much code as you need to handle what went wrong.
<bee_keeper>	i want to use pytest as the test runner for a django app.  i've followed the simple setup here - http://pytest.org/latest/goodpractises.html#integration-with-setuptools-test-commands but it's not creating the db tables for the tests - any ideas?
<the-compiler>	colonolgron: python2 will be eol in 2020 if i remember correctly - that's still a few years, but why bother learning something which you already know will be obsolete soon
<igenius>	if i put return statements in both the try and except blocks, is there any chance that both return statement could get executed?
<igenius>	so that my function returns deuce
<tos9>	igenius: every function in python returns 1 object, unless it has an uncaught exception, always.
<kirkmcdonald>	igenius: the more intresting/infuriating case is when you have return statements in both the try block and the finally block.
<kirkmcdonald>	igenius: skipping to the end of this lesson, the moral is never to return inside of a finally block.
<simpson>	igenius: try it and see.
<kirkmcdonald>	igenius: as for returning in both the try block and the except block: if the try block is able to return, the except block is never even executed.
<kirkmcdonald>	igenius: because the except block only runs when there is an exception.
<simpson>	igenius: http://paste.pound-python.org/show/vxdfbs3xcfmd9grly7sg/
<kirkmcdonald>	igenius: and if it raised an exception, the return statement hadn't executed yet.
<kirkmcdonald>	igenius: so the try/except case is actually very straightforward.
<igenius>	oh cuz finally is gauranteed to execute right
<igenius>	so kirkmcdonald - do you also recommend never using just plain old "except: " by itself - to always use a specific exception type
<simpson>	igenius: yes.
<igenius>	and if so, what sort of exception type should i use if my beautifulsoup parser tries to find() something that isn't in the document
<simpson>	igenius: or, more specifically, to never have a bare except without a bare rase.
<simpson>	*raise, even.
<simpson>	`except: ...; raise`
<simpson>	which is useful for logging but not much else.
<hiptobecubic>	desophos, figure it out?
<desophos>	hiptobecubic: yep, i think i got it
<desophos>	hiptobecubic: thank you!
<hiptobecubic>	desophos, sure
<score_under>	http://p.pomf.se/7327 is there any obvious reason why this is so slow?
<score_under>	i tried the more obvious approach ("chunk, remaining = remaining[:width], remaining[width:]") and that was really slow too
<colonolgron>	the-compiler, i see, well actually, with many code examples i have no idea whether its 2 or 3
<score_under>	on a modest set of files it takes 20 seconds in python3 and 35 seconds in pypy3
<score_under>	my gut feeling says it should be at least a factor of 100 faster than that
<hiptobecubic>	score_under, profile it.
<r00s>	score_under: have you tried data.encode("hex")?
<score_under>	hiptobecubic, there's not much to profile. i know that almost all the time is spent in that function though
<hiptobecubic>	pip install line_profiler
<r00s>	score_under: not true, you would see where in the function the time is spent
<score_under>	hex looks like it's close, but i'm looking for comma separation and 0x prefixes too
<r00s>	or rather where in python
<igenius>	so simpson, which exception type would you recommend for xml parsing?
<colonolgron>	i use sh.git to acces git. now i would like to the all author names from sh.git("log") with python. how should one do that? i mean its not normal text right? its in a pager or something. do i have to pipe it in a file and then read it from the file?
<r00s>	score_under: try something like ["0x%02x" % byte for byte in [data[i:i+1] for i in range(0, len(data))]]
<r00s>	and then ", ".join(...)
<r00s>	it's faster because the iteration part is done in c code, instead of python code
<simpson>	igenius: whatever you like. tbh i probably wouldn't use exceptions if designing a new xml parser.
<r00s>	or rather, it should be faster ;-)
<igenius>	would would you use then? i thought you always need exceptions in the event something bad happens
<igenius>	no xml parser can be expected to parse everything successfully
<igenius>	simpson, what if i try to except a specific error, but the exception created by the block of code actually turns out to be a different type of exception?
<r00s>	colonolgron: if you use subprocess.check_output, you should get the output
<igenius>	then the except specificerror: won't catch anything right?
<r00s>	colonolgron: man git-log has some details on different output formats
<r00s>	igenius: correct
<igenius>	so then, if i don't know what exception type could be raised, i should just use a bare "except:" right?
<r00s>	depends, usually you want your program to crash if you don't handle something
<r00s>	just continuing as if nothing happened is often worse than crashing
<igenius>	i never thought about it that way
<r00s>	if you catch exceptions everywhere without really handling them the proper way, your application will behave in weird ways, and you won't know why
<the-compiler>	igenius: a base except: (without re-raising) is *always* (well, 99.9% of the cases) the wrong thing - you'd usually find out what exceptions can be caused (by testing or reading the docs) and handle only those you actually know how to handle - because of what r00s just said
<the-compiler>	igenius: usually a library has some base-exception and all others inherit from that - it might make sense to catch that base exception then.
<igenius>	the problem with beautiful soup is that it doesn't use its own parser, so i have to lookup the documentation on all these other parsers
<igenius>	(to find out what exceptions could be raised)
<igenius>	http://www.crummy.com/software/beautifulsoup/bs4/doc/
<igenius>	there are two different kinds of parse errors. there are crashes, where you feed a document to beautiful soup and it raises an exception, usually an htmlparser.htmlparseerror. and there is unexpected behavior, where a beautiful soup parse tree looks a lot different than the document used to create it.
<jj15>	i have an odd question. i learnt the term “real programmer” today. i googled “programming syndrome” looking for any articles on being addicted to coding. i thought maybe it’s my aspergers and this is my special interest. but i hit an article that rang true. i literally spend 80% to 90% of my waking hours programming, or reading books. anyone here had similar issues?
<igenius>	hey jj15 - talk to codeotaku when he comes back, he has that issue
<jj15>	programming is now causing health problems, it’s just broke off my relationship because of the amount of time i spend doing it. real problem now that i sort of want to fix.
<jj15>	ah thanks igenius
<r00s>	well... try to get another hobby
<the-compiler>	igenius: and if anything, you want "except exception:", so at least things like keyboardinterrupt or systemexit
<the-compiler>	igenius: don't get caught
<r00s>	being unable to stop once you're in the flow is common
<igenius>	oh i was wondering how to avoid keyboardinterrupt exceptions and catch em
<the-compiler>	(i can't even finish a full sentence. i need sleep.)
<score_under>	running line_profiler on the output of kernprof on the script just gives me "timer unit: 1e-06 s"
<igenius>	thanks the-compiler!
<hiptobecubic>	jj15, or wait until you burn out and then you can be a goat farmer, which is every programmer's secret dream.
<jj15>	r00s: this has been going on 15 years. i’ve never worked in a job longer than 2 months because i walk out and leave. and my programming is never for money.
<igenius>	so apparently exception is the "mother" inheritor of all these other exception classes
<jj15>	i’ll get that article, it’s mad how it explained everything to a t
<r00s>	why do you leave?
<jj15>	http://www.businessinsider.com/syndromes-drive-coders-crazy-2014-3?ir=t
<hiptobecubic>	jj15, have you tried programming for money?
<jj15>	hiptobecubic: yes, i dislike it.
<teotwaki>	jj15: go see a therapist. the internet won't help you.
<r00s>	igenius: afaik lxml.html throws fewer exceptions
<jj15>	teotwaki: i have help for aspergers, i’ll bring it up. it’s only something i’ve actually learnt about today. i thought i was alone.
<teotwaki>	jj15: i wouldn't call it comon, but not unheard of either.
<teotwaki>	common*
<igenius>	r00s do i need to import certain exceptions specifically?
<igenius>	or can i just import the whole module and get the exception classes too?
<r00s>	jj15: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ws5xoz7rq8
<jj15>	meh time for a beer, and watch the channel for a bit.
<r00s>	;-)
<dxiri>	guys, can you tell why i am getting everything inside the same index instead of getting a dictionary out of the json environment variable? please see http://pastebin.com/21drzarz
<infobob>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/jni7qzajod07urx5c1gk/ (repasted for dxiri)
<score_under>	http://p.pomf.se/7328 if anyone knows what could be going on here
<jj15>	r00s: ha! i love this.
<jj15>	i’m going to watch this whenever i’m stressed.
<r00s>	personally i'd recommend you to go running
<the-compiler>	the weird sounds in that video stress me ;)
<score_under>	dxiri, not sure if it's what you're asking but: "apikey = apiservices[0]" shouldn't this be something like "apikey = apiservices[0]['credentials']['apikey']"
<jj15>	r00s: i used to love running, but age, and sitting at the computer for so long over the years has me a bit nervous.
<jj15>	i’m 30, i feel 60
<the-compiler>	jj15: i know the feeling... i guess i should get some home trainer thing (not sure how they're called in english) and spend some time there watching python talks :p
<dxiri>	score_under, yes, that's what i am asking :d let me try that one, i was under the impression that [0] would be name, [1] label, [2]credentials, and so on
<teotwaki>	jj15: what you're feeling has less to do with programming (or python for that matter) and more to do with your social interactions.
<score_under>	dxiri, the [0] is referring to the first {...} inside the [...]
<jj15>	the-compiler: ha ha. that’s actually not a bad idea. i tried the t25 focus thing. i nearly died after the first one. i would suggest that though, honestly, its hard.
<r00s>	jj15: then you should start doing sports again
<jj15>	teotwaki: the social side of things is down to anxiety and aspergers. that’s always been a problem for me.
<r00s>	sitting around won't make you fitter, if you already feel old
<score_under>	dxiri, if you have a linux machine, install jq. then try something like "<<<$vcap_services jq '.user-provided'" and compare to "<<<$vcap_services jq '.user-provided[0]'"
<jj15>	r00s: i think after everything today, and the way i feel in general, thats a good idea. lets see if i make it to the gym tomorrow morning.
<teotwaki>	jj15: no need to go to the gym. try to complete an m100.
<r00s>	lol
<jj15>	m100? marathon?
<score_under>	in fact that should be "<<<$vcap_services jq '.["user-provided"]'" and "<<<$vcap_services jq '.["user-provided"][0]'"
<r00s>	100 miles, i guess ;-)
<jj15>	i googled, and i got some sort of imge of a galaxy.
<the-compiler>	hah, seems like what i was talking about is a stationary bicycle in english... we call them "home trainer" in (swiss) german.
<igenius>	how do i make sure keyboardinterrupts don't get caught
<the-compiler>	(just like we call a cellphone a handy, or a video projector a beamer... german, stop importing english words and using them improperly!)
<teotwaki>	jj15: i'll pm you the link, ok?
<score_under>	actually why not i just screenshot the output dxiri https://a.uguu.se/nwtlqh.png
<jj15>	the-compiler: ah, yeah i have a bike. it’s got one gear, but i do use it most times when i leave the house.
<jj15>	teotwaki: yeah sure bud
<the-compiler>	igenius: by not catching them? ;)
<igenius>	hahahaha
<teotwaki>	jj15: that's called a fixie :)
<the-compiler>	igenius: i.e. by not using bare excepts for example
<igenius>	i mean, when i stop my program this little ssl.py file keeps popping up. it's so annoying
<igenius>	i am using pyscripter in windows7
<jj15>	a whatsi?
<the-compiler>	anyways, i'm off to bed, it's midnight here again already
<jj15>	goodnight the-compiler thanks for the chat :)
<colonolgron>	r00s, i tried like this: https://bpaste.net/show/c0f7e58cbc01
<igenius>	by compiler
<r00s>	colonolgron: use subprocess.check_output(["git", "log], cwd=...)
<r00s>	don't use popen if you only need the output
<colonolgron>	r00s, okay!
<r00s>	check_output will directly give you the output
<harej>	if i have a really big dictionary that i then wipe out with a "dict = {}", does that wipe it from ram and thus reduce my ram footprint?
<kirkmcdonald>	harej: maybe!
<score_under>	check_output is one of the bigger reasons to hate centos :|
<harej>	kirkmcdonald: maybe?
<r00s>	harej: you could also try dict.clear()
<heatmeiser>	harej: the any gc language is going to be unpredictable
<score_under>	i remember having to reimplement that several times at work just because there's no python 2.7 for centos :p
<score_under>	but that is by the by
<kirkmcdonald>	harej: there are a number of factors.
<kirkmcdonald>	harej: for a start, if anything else holds a reference to the dict, then that won't discard it.
<r00s>	well cpython is not garbage collected. if you don't have any other references to the elements in the dict, it should free the memory
<ssbr_at_work>	*is* garbage collected
<kirkmcdonald>	reference counting is a method of garbage collection.
<kirkmcdonald>	and then there is *also* a mark & sweep gc for detecting and collecting reference cycles.
<harej>	now, i guess i should be asking my *real* question. say i have a dictionary of 2,100 lists, and i want to compare each list to the other ones and do a set comparison. 2,100 * 2,100 = 4.41 million, so what is the most efficient way of doing this?
<r00s>	well, it's a rather predictable form of garbage collection
<score_under>	http://p.pomf.se/7330 figured the bugger out, but i'm not sure what to make of those results. i tried the solution r00s gave but i'm not sure how to adapt it to work unchanged in the code (and not throw indexerror)
<heatmeiser>	harej: so you want to compare one list to 2099 other lists?
<harej>	heatmeiser: rather, i want to compare each list to all the other lists. so list 1 will be compared with 2 through 2100; list 2 will be compared with 1;3-2100; list 3 will be compared with 1-2;4-2100, and so on...
<r00s>	harej: what's in those lists? can you represent them as vectors?
<dxiri>	score_under, you rule! :d that worked
<harej>	the lists contain page titles
<r00s>	is the number of pages limited?
<harej>	the largest list is around 1.2 million but the vast majority are <10,000
<harej>	and usually <5,000
<kirkmcdonald>	harej: ultimately it will call malloc() and free().
<r00s>	and what exactly do you mean by "comparing" them? equality?
<kirkmcdonald>	harej: so whether it will hand memory back to the os depends on the behavior of malloc() and free().
<harej>	r00s: intersections. list 1 and list 2 have 700 titles in common, list 1 and list 3 have 30 titles in common, etc.
<kirkmcdonald>	harej: perhaps convert these lists to sets?
<harej>	i'd probably have to anyway, to make the comparison. but does that make it a lot more efficiently?
<harej>	i never quite groked the technical difference between a list and a set.
<kirkmcdonald>	harej: linear rather than quadratic...
<kirkmcdonald>	harej: a list is an array. a set is a hash table.
<python243>	i am using re - and i wrote re.findall(r"[-+]?\d*\.\d+|\d+", mystr) to find a number in a string. but i have one problem...
<python243>	i came across a number like 1e-05, which it will match - i will however obtain "105" (which i am not very happy with).
<harej>	that barely clarifies it, unfortunately. i'm assuming sets are stored in memory more efficiently?
<python243>	since 1e-05 is not equal to 105.
<python243>	how can i match this format?
<kirkmcdonald>	harej: no, actually, a hash table will use a little more memory than an array with the same number of items.
<score_under>	ugly as heck but you could hack in hashability http://p.pomf.se/7331
<r00s>	harej: for memory efficiency, you probably want a sparse matrix. but i'm not sure how to do the computation on that yet
<kirkmcdonald>	harej: but checking whether a particular value is contained in a hash table is very fast.
<harej>	ah
<harej>	the speed factor is compelling, but given the extent of these comparisons, i'm more concerned about memory usage. the reports won't be run all that often so speed is less important.
<seylerius>	python243: r"(\d*\.\d+|\d+)(e-?\d+)?"
<python243>	seylerius: thanks a lot - i will try it! :d
<heatmeiser>	harej: how/where is this data living?
<somelauw>	nedbat: thanks, nice article
<_habnabit>	somelauw, why do you hate negative numbers
<_habnabit>	er
<_habnabit>	seylerius, why do you hate negative numbers
<harej>	heatmeiser: the data is derived from numerous sql queries
<kirkmcdonald>	oh hey, are we lexing integer literals with regexes?
<kirkmcdonald>	or, number literals, i guess.
<kirkmcdonald>	woo floats.
<python243>	kirkmcdonald: yeah
<python243>	i think we can assume that they are non-negative, since it is p-values :)
<heatmeiser>	i mean a set it definitely going to be the way to go. i'm just curious if there's a way where you can stream the data out of the db instead of loading the entire set into memory if you're concerned about memory management.
<harej>	heatmeiser: unfortunately i have to do a lot of sanitation to the data before i can do the comparisons i want. otherwise i'd just be doing it all in sql
<score_under>	python243,
<r00s>	harej: use a scipy sparse matrix with boolean type
<score_under>	>>> 5e+5
<score_under>	500000.0
<python243>	score_under: yes, i know that - but i need to match it... ;)
<score_under>	oh
<python243>	i get an output from another program, which i do not control
<score_under>	it's not much of a modification: r"(\d*\.\d+|\d+)(e-?\d+)?" → r"(\d*\.\d+|\d+)(e[-+]?\d+)?"
<python243>	i just want to grab the numbers
<_habnabit>	score_under, why do you hate negative numbers
<score_under>	which can be shortened to r"(\d*\.)?\d+(e[-+]?\d+)?"
<heatmeiser>	harej: ugh. gross.
<score_under>	_habnabit, he said he isn't expecting them
<_habnabit>	score_under, who?
<score_under>	_habnabit, python243
<igenius>	_habnabit - when i see a closing tag in xml which has the slash after the word, what does that mean?
<igenius>	for example i see a tag which has <offers\> and no opening tag to pair up with
<python243>	score_under: seylerius already gave me r"(\d*\.\d+|\d+)(e-?\d+)?" - is that equivalent to your expression?
<python243>	but thanks a lot!
<score_under>	python243, i was basing the expression on that
<_habnabit>	igenius, i'm not sure why you're asking me, or why you're asking #python
<python243>	score_under: oh :)
<igenius>	good point
<uskerine>	hi, i am reading a book about python and would like to make some examples. i am following this example: http://www.dreamsyssoft.com/python-scripting-tutorial/create-simple-rest-web-service-with-python.php
<python243>	score_under: so r"(\d*\.)?\d+(e[-+]?\d+)?" is the best one? :d
<uskerine>	how do you import web python package? (ubuntu 12.04)
<_habnabit>	score_under, not sure where you got 'he' from, but i don't know why you'd omit negative number support anyway
<score_under>	python243, depends what you consider best :p try it on a variety of inputs
<igenius>	python is a general purpose language though, so all sorts of "i'm using python to talk to a server" or "i'm using python to parse my file" come up
<r00s>	harej: the columns are the sets, the rows represent the titles. then you can multiply the matrix with any of the columns (transposed) and as a result get the number of common titles with all other sets
<synt4x`>	can you take the absolute value of the difference of datetimes?
<_habnabit>	uskerine, oh, yikes, this tutorial is super awful
<score_under>	_habnabit, oh don't start that new age gender neutral pronoun stuff pls
<_habnabit>	score_under, 'they' is hardly 'new age'
<_habnabit>	synt4x`, tias?
<score_under>	that's right, but it doesn't mean you should be picking people up on every use of 'he' to mean someone of unknown gender.
<ssbr_at_work>	_habnabit: it's new age to support age-old grammatical conventions for the sake of inclusiveness
<ssbr_at_work>	score_under: no, there are different reasons to do that
<score_under>	why don't i go around picking people up on their grammar all the time too |:
<_habnabit>	ssbr_at_work, oh, of course
<synt4x`>	_habnabit: i'm not sure what tias means? i am finding the difference of 2 datetimes and i want to know if they are >15 minutes apart
<kirkmcdonald>	synt4x`: the abs() builtin will work.
<_habnabit>	synt4x`, try it and see
<python243>	score_under: thanks!
<synt4x`>	_habnabit: haha ok fair hadn't heard that, kirkmcdonald: ty
<r00s>	harej: just multiplying the matrix with its transposed self should do the trick
<r00s>	one line in scipy
<igenius>	r00s how do i handle a keybaord interrupt without using try catch?
<igenius>	could i do this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4205317/capture-keyboardinterrupt-in-python-without-try-except
<_habnabit>	igenius, why do you want to avoid using try-except?
<igenius>	because i don't know where to put it
<uskerine>	(>>> from the example >>>   "first you will want to install web.py if you don't have it already. ")
<uskerine>	found it myself. http://webpy.org/install#install
<_habnabit>	uskerine, yeah, please please please don't follow this tutorial
<_habnabit>	uskerine, web.py is really bad, and the tutorial is bad anyway
<igenius>	dear _habnabit - because i don't know exactly where to put the tryexcept block
<r00s>	igenius: you could put it around your main function
<blag>	can i use lib2to3 to parse python 3?
<uskerine>	_habnabit, what would you recommend for simple rest services?
<_habnabit>	igenius, well, what do you want to do when someone hits c-c?
<_habnabit>	blag, no. it only parses python 2
<igenius>	i just don't want a traceback to happen
<uskerine>	and why web.py is bad?
<_habnabit>	uskerine, do you have experience with web application development and security?
<_habnabit>	uskerine, web.py predates python code being good
<_habnabit>	igenius, ok, well, there's effectively an infinite number of things it could do instead. what do you want to happen instead?
<uskerine>	i have some degree of experience with java, but i want to do a quick prototype
<ssbr_at_work>	django is pretty nifty for quick prototypes :)
<blag>	_habnabit: is there a way to parse python 3 and preserve comments?
<uskerine>	why web.py rpedates python code being good?
<_habnabit>	uskerine, ok, then there's a number of choices. i like pyramid a lot, but i've heard good things about falcon too specifically for apis
<ssbr_at_work>	uskerine: universal law: python code wasn't good until when <person who is speaking> started programming in python
<_habnabit>	heh
<veegee>	hi all, just a quick couple of questions:
<veegee>	1. if i want to contribute to psycopg2, is the author open to merging patches?
<igenius>	_habnabit - since i am using pyscripter in windows, i don't hit ctrl-c, i press the stop button. and everytime i do, this stupid 'ssl.py' file opens up and wastes my time
<igenius>	_habnabit - i would like to stop that file from opening up everytime
<veegee>	the docstrings need some serious work, because pycharm can't autocomplete and it's a very easy thing to fix
<veegee>	2. if i have a threaded connection pool, what's the best way to make sure the connection gets put back in case of an exception in the middle of the function?
<lseactuary>	anyone know of a good programming solution that could categorise a facebook page dependant on vertical e.g. cpg, government, etc and then auto update if the profession etc of the person changed?
<veegee>	i don't want to have to wrap everything in a try/except/finally
<_habnabit>	veegee, use sqlalchemy's connection pool instead of writing your own
<veegee>	looking for something like go's `defer` so can do `defer pool.putconn(conn)
<veegee>	_habnabit, i'm not writing my own, i'm using psycopg2.pool.threadedconnectionpool
<baggar11>	can anyone tell me what my for loop should look like when i try to pass a variable and run a command? --> https://www.refheap.com/100474
<ssbr_at_work>	veegee: you'd use a with statement
<igenius>	_habnabit ? any suggestions
<veegee>	ssbr_at_work, well shit, totally forgot those existed
<igenius>	_habnabit - since i am using pyscripter in windows, i don't hit ctrl-c, i press the stop button. and everytime i do, this stupid 'ssl.py' file opens up and wastes my time. i would like to at least have the 'ssl.py' file not open up
<r00s>	veegee: or maybe a decorator for the whole function
<veegee>	ssbr_at_work, does psycopg2 support the with context?
<ssbr_at_work>	veegee: if it doesn't it's trivial to write a context manager
<veegee>	ssbr_at_work, only minor nuisance is that it indents everything a whole tab
<ssbr_at_work>	instead of x = bar(); try: blah(x);; finally: whatever(x)  -- def manager(): x = bar(); yield x; whatever(x)
<veegee>	r00s, decorator is a bloody wonderful idea
<ssbr_at_work>	eh
<_habnabit>	uskerine, https://bpaste.net/raw/9d0b757de80a is a list of things wrong with web.py, if you care
<ssbr_at_work>	decorate manager with @contextlib.context_manager
<veegee>	r00s,  but how can i make the decorator aware of the connection object that the function itself requires?
<uskerine>	falcon seems easy, but i still did not understand why web.py is a bad choice
<_habnabit>	uskerine, see above
<ssbr_at_work>	veegee: wow, contextmanager. memory is not reliable. https://docs.python.org/2/library/contextlib.html
<veegee>	also, i wrote this library: https://github.com/veegee/guv which has 177 stars
<veegee>	essentially gevent for python 3
<ssbr_at_work>	veegee: w.r.t. indentation, the with statement is pretty lame, but whatever, it works for what it does. you can also use decorators if you want this to last for a whole function.
<veegee>	but i havent advertised it much
<veegee>	i need people to help contribute to it, so far im the only one
<uskerine>	i did not see the link, sorry
<blag>	_habnabit: thanks for your help! :)
<uskerine>	falcon seems easy
<ssbr_at_work>	the problem with using decorators is they end up magically adding arguments or some bs like that, it isn't actually easy to understand.
<uskerine>	pyramid seems a bit more obscure
<_habnabit>	uskerine, 'obscure'?
<veegee>	any ideas on how i can get people to contribute?
<veegee>	ssbr_at_work, yeah i can add another param to my function and have it return a partial or something
<veegee>	but it's dirty
<veegee>	another dirty option is to have a global-scoped threadlocal storing the current connection
<simpson>	veegee: convince people that it fills a niche and also that it would be a stellar library but for a few low-hanging bugs that are easy to fix.
<veegee>	and have the decorator automatically put the connection if there's an exception
<veegee>	simpson, it's already working great, but since i started my own company, didn't have enough time to work on it a lot
<veegee>	im going to be working on it as much as i can
<veegee>	but i know people really like gevent
<uskerine>	_habnabit, i will try falcon, it says minimalist and web api and phrases grace hopper in the landing page
<r00s>	veegee: hmm, maybe get the connection in the decorator from somewhere?
<veegee>	and this right now works for a great number of cases, even for posgres and cassandra
<_habnabit>	uskerine, pyramid is better if you want to make more than just an api, fwiw
<uskerine>	i just want an api
<veegee>	r00s, no no, i'll just override getconn() to store a copy in a threadlocal, and have the decorator close the object in the threadlocal, this will work
<ssbr_at_work>	if you _just_ want to make an api, wouldn't the best thing be something based on twisted?
<uskerine>	i will check twisted
<veegee>	no it's not just an api
<_habnabit>	ssbr_at_work, hmm, yeah, maybe
<simpson>	veegee: you don't have to convince me. (and you probably can't.) what makes a community is a combination of good ideas and lackluster implementations.
<ssbr_at_work>	for that matter... why not grpc? :o
<_habnabit>	uskerine, klein with twisted, if you go down that route
<python243>	score_under: still here?
<veegee>	simpson, what do you mean?
<r00s>	veegee: the decorator should also be able to access the function arguments
<veegee>	r00s, doesn't need to, i'll use a global-scoped threadlocal
<simpson>	veegee: a community only forms around a collaboration if the collaborative efforts are easy to make and meaningful.
<uskerine>	_habnabit, what does "klein" mean?
<_habnabit>	uskerine, it's a library
<simpson>	veegee: so a slightly buggy or slightly unadorned application will attract lots of people who come to fix a bug and stay for the community.
<veegee>	simpson, well greenlets/async stuff/cffi is not easy to use
<python243>	the regular expression does not do exactly what i want. for 6e-05, i obtain the tuple ('6', 'e-05')
<python243>	i wanted to obtain 6e-05
<veegee>	simpson, also i don't really know how to build a community
<python243>	i just tried it.
<ssbr_at_work>	veegee: by doing what simpson said ;)
<simpson>	veegee: i literally just told you the secret.
<kirkmcdonald>	python243: which re function are you calling?
<ssbr_at_work>	simpson: you wrote bravo, right? that seems pretty successful as far as communities go.
<ssbr_at_work>	that's clout, right?
<python243>	findall - like: re.findall(r"[-+]?\d*\.\d+|\d+", mystr)
<_habnabit>	simpson, oh, is this why tornado has a bigger community than twisted?
<ssbr_at_work>	(albeit, wasn't the community full of twelve year olds?)
<veegee>	simpson, i'm having trouble seeing it, can you spell it out?
<python243>	kirkmcdonald
<simpson>	you're doing everything right so far: you've opened the source, you've documented some stuff and made it clear that you welcome contributions...
<kirkmcdonald>	python243: if you use re.finditer() instead, it will yield match objects.
<veegee>	i have a kickass sphinx theme too ;)
<kirkmcdonald>	python243: then you can call e.g. m.group(0) to get the complete match as a string.
<simpson>	what you need to do next is demonstrate *exactly how* a newcomer can contribute. and then sidle up next to another related community (say, gevent or eventlet) and start discussions.
<simpson>	ssbr_at_work: yeah. bravo's community was decent but small. i had a disconnect with the larger mc community: i offered quality software and they didn't really want it.
<veegee>	simpson, ah the second point is great
<python243>	kirkmcdonald: attributeerror: 'callable-iterator' object has no attribute 'group'
<veegee>	simpson, thiago from neovim wants to use my pyuv_cffi implementation in neovim anyway
<kirkmcdonald>	python243: no, no, like: for m in re.finditer(...): print m.group(0)
<veegee>	so i just have to clean that up as well i guess
<simpson>	veegee: there you go! that's a chance to get more contributors and to get people to be aware of your stuff.
<veegee>	libuv is the only useful thing to come out of the whole node.js trashpile
<kirkmcdonald>	python243: the alternative is to make sure your regex uses non-grouping parentheses.
<python243>	kirkmcdonald: maybe it is just because i am not very familiar with regular expression yet, but...
<python243>	hm - but how does that solve the problem, if '6' is one match and 'e-05' is another match? it should be one match.
<kirkmcdonald>	python243: it is possible i have misunderstood the problem. what is the regex you're using?
<veegee>	i also want to donate to the pypy team, how much would get them to finish up their pypy3 python3.3-compatible branch?
<veegee>	$1k? $10k?
<python243>	the one suggested here: r"(\d*\.\d+|\d+)(e[-+]?\d+)?"
<python243>	by score_under
<kirkmcdonald>	python243: okay, i was right.
<kirkmcdonald>	python243: the tuple is a single match.
<_habnabit>	python243, if you're going to use that regexp, i highly recommend you put a comment next to it saying "yes, i know that this doesn't match negative numbers. this code is bad and i feel bad."
<kirkmcdonald>	python243: the parentheses define "groups". when you use .findall() with a regex that defines groups, it returns a tuple of the groups for each match.
<python243>	kirkmcdonald: oh - but i could not get just 6e-05 rather than the tuple then?
<kirkmcdonald>	python243: but if you use re.finditer() instead of re.findall(), it will give you match objects instead of tuples.
<python243>	i will try :)
<kirkmcdonald>	python243: and you can get that string from the match object, by calling m.group(0) as i have shown.
<python243>	actually i would not expect that the program could write more than one number in that line - will it simplify the problem, if we assume there is only one number in the line?
<python243>	 i just used findall to be safe
<kirkmcdonald>	python243: you could use re.search instead, then.
<kirkmcdonald>	python243: (which will return a match object.)
<python243>	kirkmcdonald: but would i have the same problem with the tuples then?
<python243>	oh
<kirkmcdonald>	python243: well, or it will return none, if a match is not found.
<veegee>	all my company's projects use python, some of which has computationally-intensive stuff like nltk which has a > 2x speed boost pypy, so i dont mind donating $1-10k if it means they will speed things up because itll save me a shitload on server costs
<python243>	kirkmcdonald: i tried to print it:
<python243>	<_sre.sre_match object at 0x7fcdde6d1ad0>
<python243>	can i convert it to a float?
<kirkmcdonald>	python243: yes. you want: print m.group(0)
<python243>	oh
<kirkmcdonald>	python243: that will return the matched text as string.
<kirkmcdonald>	python243: you may be able to pass it to float() to convert that string to a float.
<darkelement>	hey guys i want to represent this line in a log as a key and value in a dict: stumbles: redefine what?, ["yeah but python also clearly doesn't care about performance."]
<darkelement>	 how can i make the elements in the brackets appended to the key that is the item before the bracket?
<therealfakemoot>	darkelement: how about you actually show us what you want that to look like
<therealfakemoot>	darkelement: take your example and show exactly what you want the output to be
<keypusher>	seems like a rather incendiary example
<someircname>	keypusher: you're an incendiary example!
<locusasaf>	anyone have any advice on my bpaste or was the question too vague?
<sleblanc>	locusasaf, if i am not mistaken, a function will capture a global variable, as long as you assign nothing to it
<redzaku>	locusasaf: those really should just be methods of the class instances
<locusasaf>	sleblanc: the code works, i'm just looking for alternatives
<sleblanc>	if you wish to assign something to this name, you have to add the "global my_name" statement
<someircname>	locusasaf: you probably don't want to do it that way.  you can, but it will work in mysterious ways.
<sleblanc>	locusasaf, oh, ok
<rockfruit>	when i see someone catting two lists like this:    list1[0:0] = list2     - list2 is prepended to list1.   is this a performance hack?  i can't imagine why else to use so non-obvious a format.  list2.extend(list1) is not the same?
<dowwie>	in python 3, has anyone been successful at overriding __instancecheck__  in a class?
<dowwie>	i'm struggling a bit..
<someircname>	rockfruit: for what it's worth, list1[0:0] = list2 is more clear to me than list2.extend(list1) … i don't even have to think about what "extend" is
<someircname>	but yeah it's the same.
<locusasaf>	someircname: in this case those myvar's are instances of the boto library and there are functions i'm using those in so it seems strange to pass them around
<voodoonofx_>	given just a gmt offset like "-4", can pytz get a real tz object from it?
<rockfruit>	well, i guess now that i've seen it, i will never forget it, and so perhaps you are right about the clarity o f it...
<sleblanc>	locusasaf, instead of calling func1, can't you just call myvar2.func2(a, b) directly?
<sleblanc>	locusasaf, or when you need objects to stick together, you can define a wrapper class that contains such variables
<locusasaf>	sleblanc: yeah this is a bit of trite example
<sleblanc>	locusasaf, i understand
<dude-x>	rockfruit: i did a timeit test, extend is faster.
<dude-x>	but this is a small list i tested with
<locusasaf>	i feel like the wrapper class essentially just reorders things, everything is still global but now i have a class surrounding everything
<sleblanc>	consider a class mystate that includes a myvar1 object and a myvar2 objects
<dude-x>	rockfruit: extend is clearer to me.
<rockfruit>	dude-x well the example i'm seeing, is zc.buildout, modifying sys.path - not a big list...
<jakey2>	how do i do a switch statement in python
<gbiv>	jakey2: if / elif / elif / elif / ... / else
<phrohdoh>	jakey2: if -else
<redzaku>	jakey2: you don't. maybe try a dict?
<phrohdoh>	python doesn’t have switch/case
<dude-x>	rockfruit: zope software is pretty old. maybe it was faster back then.
<rockfruit>	huh well.  thanks.
<bpalmer>	a dispatch dictionary is pretty idiomatic
<darkelement>	hey guys i want to use youtube-dl to download all the videos in a playlist, but it will only download the first. what am i doing wrong with thiscommand? youtube-dl --playlist-start 1 https://youtu.be/a5pbrd1jh04?list=pleseuhrelqohh1xzm05wo3r7q5cc-2bsl
<sleblanc>	pycoderf, what have you tried?
<pycoderf>	sleblanc: not much yet. i just have my directory structure up with a sample hello world script for the moment.
<pessimist>	darkelement: wrong channel
<whytrytofly>	yeryry: sorry for being annoying...when i now wanna write these entries to some ext file, how can i keep the shape
<codetaku>	darkelement: you need to refer to the link to the playlist, not to the first video in the playlist
<sleblanc>	uwsgi is fortunately very straightforward to configure. set the python path accordingly (to your base folder) then pass it the name of the module that contains your app, and a reference to your app
<sleblanc>	presto, you're done
<pycoderf>	sleblanc: on ventos 7 i have a /etc/uwsgi.d directory. do i put the configs there? tutorials say to put them in the focroot
<codetaku>	darkelement: i will pm you
<pycoderf>	sleblanc: can you pm me?
<sleblanc>	pycoderf, sure, good idea
<whytrytofly>	yeryry:  list=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
<whytrytofly>	              outfile should be:
<whytrytofly>	            1   4   7
<whytrytofly>	            2   5   8
<whytrytofly>	            3   6   9
<darkelement>	i got it working actually, just removed everything and made it youtube-dl <playlist video>
<yeryry>	whytrytofly: so you want what... it to all go into one string? or be written to a file?
<whytrytofly>	yeryry:  file
<yeryry>	well, just use file.write instead of print?
<whytrytofly>	yeryry:  but then it will be one column in my file wont it
<yeryry>	what's a "column"?
<atrigent>	monkehparade: well in any case, that guy was not correct about node - other than maybe the async thing, node isn't intrinsically better for scraping assuming you're using libraries that do essentially the same thing
<whytrytofly>	yeryry:
<whytrytofly>	1
<whytrytofly>	2
<whytrytofly>	3
<whytrytofly>	4
<whytrytofly>	5
<whytrytofly>	6...
<yeryry>	did you try it?
<peyed>	how do i fix this i/o error?   https://bpaste.net/show/c5bf29ef1d70
<monkehparade>	atrigent, thank you :3
<yeryry>	peyed: what is fd? don't you mean output?
<codetaku>	peyed: you're closing the file in the "for line in input" loop, so the 2nd time through the file will be closed
<peyed>	yeryry: o
<peyed>	thank you!
<whytrytofly>	yeryry: and what do i do with the second print?
<codetaku>	move your close out to happen after the loop... also, when using a "with" clause you don't need to worry about closing the file, it will do it automatically when the block is exited
<yeryry>	print "\n"
<yeryry>	i guess, for file
<peyed>	codetaku:   thank you!
<monkehparade>	atrigent, somebody at ##learnpython helped me with my question though :3
<atrigent>	glad to hear it
<somelauw>	are chr and unichr completely compatible with each other? i thought chr would use utf-8 and unichr would use unicode?
<yeryry>	chr(100) = 'd'  unichr(100) = u'd'
<atrigent>	somelauw: one makes str objects and one makes unicode objects
<henry151>	codetaku: "partimage" is the tag i'm looking for
<codetaku>	henry151: then you want to so soup.find_all('partimage')
<whytrytofly>	yeryry: i get some empty file
<whytrytofly>	http://sprunge.us/ozva
<yeryry>	open the file once, before the "a" loop
<whytrytofly>	yeryry: not i get empty []'s
<somelauw>	atrigent: so in that case chr pretty much only supports latin-1 encoding
<john>	hey all
<phrohdoh>	hi
<john>	is it normal for some functions to take longer with multiprocessing than without?
<somelauw>	because other encodings something use multiple bytes
<meejah>	john: yes, that can happen
<somelauw>	sometimes*
<yeryry>	somelauw: yeah, don't use it unles you really need to...
<atrigent>	somelauw: this http://nedbatchelder.com/text/unipain.html might be helpful for you
<john>	meejah:  do you know what the circumstances are? like is it when a lot of memory needs to be copied to child processes or something?
<yeryry>	yeah, i was just about to paste that... py3 may be helpful too
<john>	because it seems to me the more workers in the pool, the slower the result :/
<meejah>	john: http://www.dabeaz.com/python/gil.pdf
<atrigent>	somelauw: have you seen that?
<meejah>	oh, you're using sub*processes*, not threads?
<meejah>	in that case, please describe what you're doing
<somelauw>	atrigent: thanks, will watch it sometime
<john>	yeah man, multiprocessing :(
<john>	that's why i thought it was le weird.
<atrigent>	somelauw: you should watch it now - it's a very entertaining and easy to watch talk, and it might clear up some things
<atrigent>	somelauw: basically, str isn't for storing characters, it's for storing bytes
<atrigent>	(despite the naming of the "chr" function)
<codetaku>	john: are your jobs i/o limited?
<john>	hm, i dont think so
<codetaku>	they don't hit the disk, or network?
<john>	1 file is read, loaded into ram, then x workers are made which try to do some calclation on the object
<john>	i will paste code :)
<codetaku>	are they long-running?
<whytrytofly>	yeryry: well its close now, my output is:
<whytrytofly>	[1],[2],[3]
<whytrytofly>	[4],[5],[6]
<whytrytofly>	[7],[8],[9]
<whytrytofly>	yeryry: guess i can switch that...thanks!!!
<meejah>	john: like, in shared memory?
<john>	meejah:  that would be the ideal, but in python i dont think you can effectively share memory
<john>	since all objects get an access counter, which causes the shared object to be written to, which means the shared memory gets copied
<meejah>	so each worker has its own copy of the file in ram?
<john>	meejah:  i think that's how multiprocesses usually goes down
<john>	originally, each worker gets a reference to the parent object
<john>	but as soon as they access it and python wants to update some metadata about the object, the os copies the data to another part of ram for the child
<john>	which means if 10 workers want to access 200mb of data from the parent, it's going to take up 2gb
<meejah>	more-or-less, i suppose
<codetaku>	john:  the individual jobs... do they take a significant amount of time to run?  or are there many small tasks?
<darkelement>	 hey guys what is some code that will send a given message to a channel on irc?
<mfilipe>	papna, what do you suggest in this case to be more simple?
<nedbat>	mfilipe: have you seen my messages?
<nedbat>	mfilipe: a static method on slaccounts is also a simpler way to go.
<nedbat>	mfilipe: (well, a classmethod)
<mfilipe>	nedbat, i don't know why i created a new whole class hahahha
<mfilipe>	i got that logic from my ass probably hahaha
<mfilipe>	nedbat, i really like your idea about use yield (generators)
<mfilipe>	i think it is going to work
<mfilipe>	let me try...
<mfilipe>	i never used it before
<filipemaia>	does anyone know how to use swig to wrap c functions that use a  foo(void ** ptr) as a return value?
<filipemaia>	i tried  %apply void ** output { void ** ptr }; with no luck
<prince_jammys>	mfilipe: also, i recommend that slaccount's __init__ take username, api_key and description as args and that a separate function (which could be a classmethod, if your raw line input is so common) do the parsing and instantiate the slaccount
<prince_jammys>	def __init__(self, username, api_key, description)
<skomorokh>	i want to move a dictionary mapping  several million string keys to integer, float tuples from python to java. is there some sort of standard binary format for doing this stuff?
<skomorokh>	-0.046334020667242293 takes up 22 bytes and a 64bit float is... 8. hmm... i guess it's only 3 times larger.
<skomorokh>	oh, heh, that's single precision. so ya, 6 times.
<lvh>	skomorokh: there's a few
<lvh>	skomorokh: i mean, hey, json's a thing
<skomorokh>	lvh: well, json is strings anyway... but ya, bson, i think that's a thing actually...
<skomorokh>	lvh: any other encodings come to mind off the top of your head?
<szt>	hey, what's the proper way to create python executables?
<jim>	szt, you can put a #!/path/to/python on the top line and make the file executable
<szt>	sure works great with a single file
<szt>	but i spread classes on files
<jim>	you didn't say that :p
<szt>	well okay sorry :s
<jim>	anyway, i don't know about that part :)
<szt>	okay
<jim>	you can't put the classes you include into modules, and "install" those to your python instance?
<jim>	you'd probably have to make adjustments if they're not already modules
<buck1_>	does anyone know an example of two pypi packages with mutual dependencies?
<jim>	can you put *args and **kwargs into any func, so you can call it like foo(arg1, arg2, kw1=42)?
<yhg1s_>	jim: i'm not sure what you're asking.  there is only one kind of function, really, and yes, it can take *args and **kwargs.
<jim>	it's a method with one arg already, so it'd really be called as self.docommand(intcommand, arg1, arg2, kw1=42, kw2=self)
<yhg1s_>	jim: i'm still not sure what you're asking, sorry.
<jim>	would i declare it as def docommand(self, intcommand, *args, **kwargs)?
<yhg1s_>	jim: if you want it to take arbitrary positional and keyword argumends as well as the 'intcomand' argument, sure.
<jim>	ok, so that'd work... thanks
<plm>	hi all
<plm>	why not exists a module do integrate a c++ like as ctypes for c?
<lvh>	skomorokh: there's plenty, capnproto's nice i guess.
<lvh>	skomorokh: if you're concerned about space, try compressing json.
<_habnabit>	plm, c++ doesn't have a well-defined abi
<lvh>	skomorokh: in clojure, i use nippy; i don't think there's quite the equivalent for python.
<plm>	_habnabit: may when c++0x out?
<plm>	*maybe
<_habnabit>	plm, er, you realise that this is 2015, right? we're not in 200x anymore, and c++11 is already out
<plm>	_habnabit: sorry, i was refering 11 :)
<plm>	_habnabit: it is not ready for it? a well-defined abi?
<_habnabit>	plm, c++11 does not define an abi
<plm>	_habnabit: ok
<ssbr_at_work>	l
<plm>	_habnabit: well, so the unique alternative is to use something like as swig?
<_habnabit>	plm, yeesh, no. just use cython
<runciter>	you can use cffi now
<_habnabit>	plm, cffi can kind of target c++ too
<plm>	_habnabit: hmm.. i will reasearch about cffi
<plm>	_habnabit: thanks
<ssbr_at_work>	i wish you could combine swig+cython
<jim>	yhg1s_ (or anyone), when i define it, it'd look like http://paste.debian.net/177259/, (question forthcoming)
<ssbr_at_work>	maybe i'm crazy.
<plm>	_habnabit: anyway, why the swig is not a good alternative?
<ssbr_at_work>	plm: it tries to be magical and as a result it's easy to get wrong and get memory leaks or weird obscure problems
<ssbr_at_work>	also there's giant huge mountains of documentation on it, and it still isn't documented well enough, which should say something
<plm>	ssbr_at_work: ok
<smrtz>	hello!  i need to do a serial thing in a while loop, but since it's serial, i've got to put it in a try/except.  i don't like the idea of having to open and close the connection for each iteration though.  are there any other ways?
<smrtz>	here's what i'm talking about.
<smrtz>	https://bpaste.net/show/ef7c3e9706b4
<_habnabit>	smrtz, twisted does serial stuff
<smrtz>	i know i could put a second while true loop within the try try/except, but is that the cleanest way?
<plm>	and about cytpes, is possible that a c app send message (events) to python without need to do a polling on python on c app (via ctypes)?
<smrtz>	_habnabit, i'm using pyserial, should i use that instead?
<_habnabit>	smrtz, twisted works with pyserial
<smrtz>	_habnabit, ok, i'll look it up.  thanks!
<diminoten>	but on the other hand, i think too much of it turns into "magic" when you use sqlalchemy with its out of the box settings
<brizz>	can any() be used to return dict in a list, and not just true/false if it exists?
<runciter>	no
<runciter>	brizz: you can use next(), though
<jim>	asdf`, i mean without even an orm i would write
<brizz>	ok..yea looking @ that now
<brizz>	thx
<runciter>	brizz: next(thing for thing in yourlist if thing)
<codingthings>	asdf` so, how is transforming the resultproxy object, to its final form handled best?
<diminoten>	direct db updates
<asdf`>	jim, then no, i don't think you can map relations to objects without an object relational mapping
<runciter>	brizz: if you know none isn't in yourlist, then you can do
<runciter>	brizz: next((thing for thing in yourlist if thing), none)
<asdf`>	codingthings, hmm, perhaps read the sqlalchemy tutorial, you'll learn how it is best used
<diminoten>	well obviously you can't do object relational mapping without doing object relational mapping heh
<jim>	why would thing be false?
<diminoten>	but you can read/write data without an orm
<codingthings>	asdf`, working on that too. i noticed that the column names still aren't included though
<asdf`>	codingthings, show some code?
<diminoten>	i see the argument for orms from a "rapid development" pov
<diminoten>	but as with any other rapid development argument, it's basically conceding the point of inferiority from a design standpoint
<diminoten>	"yeah this isn't great but its quick!"
<codingthings>	https://dpaste.de/izry
<diminoten>	eventually all our apps should be well tuned c programs
<diminoten>	rite? :3
<asdf`>	no, and rapid development isn't the point of an orm
<diminoten>	it's a common argument
<diminoten>	for orm
<runciter>	it's a bad one
<runciter>	as is converting all your code to c!
<diminoten>	(joking on that point)
<runciter>	:d
<asdf`>	codingthings, you did a dict() on the whole thing fetchall returned though; i have no idea what this did or why didn't it error out
<asdf`>	codingthings, .fetchall() returns a list of things, you should do dict() on each of its elements
<codingthings>	asdf` that would fail, because it hasnt returned the column names
<codingthings>	asdf`, if you remove the dict() from the query, it returns [(88, u'gaza strip')]
<crtxreavr>	know how when you define a function, you can specify a defaults for an input?
<crtxreavr>	like: def new_funtc(foo = bar):
<asdf`>	codingthings, https://bpaste.net/show/1f2f98f1d9b9
<crtxreavr>	is there a way to specify two possible options?
<codingthings>	asdf` oh, so i have to iterate?
<asdf`>	codingthings, yes, you have to do dict() on each of the elements returned by .fetchall()
<asdf`>	crtxreavr, you mean validation? no, you need to do it in the function body, not in the arguments list
<crtxreavr>	i require a string with only two valid values - 'user' or 'administrator'
<codingthings>	now it makes perfect sense. thank you asdf`
<veverak>	hi folks, anybody got pycharm? i sort of failed to get it work properly.... i have "project" with multiple subfolders, each containing separate program, aaaand pycharm still thinks that "root folder" for each subprogram is the main directory
<veverak>	which sort of breaks the helpers
<veverak>	is there some way i can tell him: "please, launch this file sub/main.py and count that sub/ is root for it" ?
<asdf`>	codingthings, (actually i noticed i skipped .fetchall() there, which you can do, as you can see... would do the same thing with it)
<veverak>	got it!
<keypusher>	veverak: you need to modify the project structure
<chipyy>	hey, i joined two list with zip function, now i would like to print first column + second column for each row... how? :)
<veverak>	keypusher: i see! thanks
<keypusher>	or "project setting", there will be a window where you can edit the project directories
<rothschild_666>	wow counter from collections is fast
<veverak>	keypusher: thanks!
<maladmin>	i'm confused: what am i doing wrong here? https://bpaste.net/show/b745667d8537
<kirkmcdonald>	maladmin: self.myvarz is never defined anywhere.
<asdf`>	maladmin, `myvars` is a class attribute
<kirkmcdonald>	oh, no, there it is.
<kirkmcdonald>	yes, it's a class attribute.
<asdf`>	maladmin, if you want each instance to get its own, you need to set it in __init__
<maladmin>	simple as that huh!
<sarcasmo>	when i merge two dictionaries like this: http://paste.pound-python.org/show/nanowe7crbbjiuw4njle/ will the duplicate keys automagically be deleted?
<maladmin>	thanks
<asdf`>	maladmin, other than that please note using methods like .getname() is pointless, since you can just do .name instead
<kirkmcdonald>	sarcasmo: the keys in ld2 will override those in ld1.
<maladmin>	asdf`: sure, just a silly example atm
<sarcasmo>	kirkmcdonald: thank you :)
<maladmin>	whats the difference between name (which is different betweent he two instances) and myvars?
<asdf`>	maladmin, you set .name for each instance in its __init__, and you don't set .myvars there
<asdf`>	maladmin, doing `self.myvars['class'] = 1` doesn't set self.myvars, it only adds an item to it
<asdf`>	maladmin, (and since there isn't a .myvars on the instance, it uses the dict that's defined on the class)
<maladmin>	ok i guess that makes sense, thanks again
<keypusher>	maladmin: difference is that myvars is an attribute of the class, therefore it is bound to the class, where self.name is bound to each instance (i think that's correct?)
<asdf`>	maladmin, usually you never "declare" your attributes like that, and if you want to document them, write a class docstring
<prince_jammys>	looks like a translation of some other language to python.
<brizz>	is there something like next that will get all dicts from a list w/a particular value preferably returning a new list?
<maladmin>	i need to go and learn these docstring things, first though i need to get this app working
<brizz>	or just if through the list?
<asdf`>	brizz, you can write a listcomp, `[somedict for somedict in mylist if "key" not in somedict]`
<chipyy>	i joined two list with zip function and sorted it, now i wanna print like before when i had two list so (' first column + second column') , any advice?
<brizz>	ok thx
<keypusher>	maladmin: consider this example: https://dpaste.de/hu4w

<cyphase>	hmm, shouldn't have used the word 'item' in the string; could be confusing given the variable
<chipyy>	can i ask u why is .format added?
<cyphase>	chipyy, it's a better way of creating a string from variables than using +
<chipyy>	cyphase: name 'item' is not defined

<cyphase>	chipyy, did you put it in the for loop? also, put this in a script; don't use the repl right now
<cyphase>	chipyy, it is useful; now i know you didn't use the for loop
<chipyy>	no i didnt put into loop because i dont understand u what u want
<cyphase>	that's you problem
<cyphase>	the for loop i mean :)
<cyphase>	for item in novdeg: print ....
<cyphase>	oh, sdeg, not novdeg
<pie_>	in py3, what do i need to override to intercept setting values in a dict?
<pie_>	i cant figure out how something is being set so this would basically be printf debugging
<chipyy>	yes i know that i must use sdeg ;) now its working like it should, i will check out now if that would be totaly ok :)
<chipyy>	ah, how could i also add counter? so in each row would be number of counter
<cyphase>	chipyy, for future reference, it's really very useful to have the whole script in a pastebin :)
<jwhisnant>	chipyy: what are you using to learn python?  and is it your first programming language?
<chipyy>	nothing i am doing python only for homework and i dont like it :)
<jwhisnant>	chipyy: "for homework" usually includes a tutorial or syllabus.  if it doesn't you should ask for your money back.
<chipyy>	and its not my first prog lang :)
<cyphase>	homework for what class?
<chipyy>	analyzing networks, stupid as helllll!!!
<jwhisnant>	chipyy: ok, what programming languages do you know well?
<chipyy>	well i dont know no one, but doing some php,html,css,javascript
<chipyy>	i still need to know how to add number of rows if i add %d and item on the end its not ok :)
<cyphase>	chipyy, look into enumerate()
<chipyy>	cyphase: couldnt i use that for loop?
<chipyy>	loop instead of enumerate, but i just dont know how
<cyphase>	chipyy, yes, you would do for idx, item in enumerate(sdeg): print ...
<chipyy>	if i add enumarate then it prints me: vozlišče (0.00023923444976076556, u'abbott') z vrednostjo 4179   and this is not ok

<cyphase>	chipyy, then you need to add it to the format string

<cyphase>	no, it wouldn't :)
<jim>	*foo in an arg list for a func means it's a list converted from positional parameters

<chipyy>	its working fine :)
<nick_zwg>	is it possible to have argparse set a mutually exclusive group where it's either *one* argument or *a few specific required arguments*?
<nick_zwg>	i can't figure out how to describe that
<nick_zwg>	i.e. i want the user to either choose '--csv' or manually enter a series of options
<cyphase>	chipyy, you might want to spend some time with the docs, or a tutorial :)
<nick_zwg>	https://docs.python.org/2/library/argparse.html#mutual-exclusion seems to indicate it's only one option out of a group
<chipyy>	nope :d i must finish 2 more homeworks and then i am free of python :d
<jim>	chipyy, so you don't actually want experience with python, and it's of no use to you... ok
<chipyy>	jim: we must program in python and simply i dont like it....
<jim>	no problem... at least you're being clear about that
<pie_>	i....i think my decorator is being applied to the wrong class...
<pie_>	but that cant be true...
<jim>	you'd probably have to show the code, where the decorator is defined, and where it's used
<pie_>	yeah its way too complicated for me to do that
<pie_>	:/ so its pretty hopless unless i figure out whats actually fgoing on
<bobryan>	is there a way to reference an argument that's going to be passed to a function? update_display(0, draw_text(3,0,"1234567890", false), 0, 7)  --  i would like the 3 in draw_text(3,...) to be the same as the first number passed to update_display()
<jim>	by its name in the argument list of the func
<jim>	you can of course assign the value to another var before the call, and use that var in the call
<jim>	not sure what you mean by reference other than that
<bobryan>	jim, argv[0] ?

<foist>	is it possible to use two separate virtualenvs side-by-side? i can’t seem to get it to work.
<runciter>	foist: what's the problem?
<foist>	runciter: i have two projects that communicate with each other. i’m running some functional tests, so the inter-project communication needs to take place. when i make a call to project 2, it is apparent that it is trying to invoke the libraries in project 1’s virtualenv, rather than its own.
<runciter>	foist: are you are making a call to project 2?
<foist>	runciter: i am making an http call to project 2.
<runciter>	foist: ok, so how'd you start project 2?
<runciter>	it's got an http server running
<runciter>	so how'd you start that?
<yvear>	alex333333, ask away
<bullhorn>	i did ex18 of lpthw
<bullhorn>	but when i run the program, the program prints "none" between each of the actual print commands
<bullhorn>	anybody experienced that?
<yvear>	bullhorn, you're probably printing a function call that has no return value
<foist>	runciter: i have this make target: http://dpaste.com/2gk8skr
<bullhorn>	but the program i typed is pretty much a copypasta of what zed show wrote in his excercise
<runciter>	foist: what's apply_async?

<foist>	runciter:  http://dpaste.com/2g6xe6j
<nedbat>	bullhorn: your code is different than the exercise
<nedbat>	bullhorn: look at lines 18-21 in your paste
<bullhorn>	o_o
<keypusher>	alex333333: generate the thing, assign it to a variable.  then send it to the text area
<bullhorn>	oh
<bullhorn>	what the hell
<bullhorn>	i print the damn thing
<bullhorn>	so i print print lol
<runciter>	foist: ok, what's nap_appname and aimweb_appname
<pie_>	i was using a static class attribute instead of an instance attribute
<codetaku>	bullhorn: yeah, the functions return nothing, and you're printing that as well as the prints inside them firing
<foist>	runciter: basically just project1-server and project2-server
<bullhorn>	thanks, im dumb
<bullhorn>	._.
<runciter>	foist: no, i want to see it
<codetaku>	heh, no, easy mistake
<nedbat>	bullhorn: i doubt it. programming is hard
<runciter>	foist: you have to call python at some point, right/
<runciter>	?
<runciter>	foist: what i'm getting at is that you should provide the path to the python intrepreter that's inside the venv
<foist>	runciter: i do that with the manage and nap_manage variables.
<runciter>	foist: so let's say nap_appname is installed in a virtualenv located at ~/.virtualenvs/nap
<bullhorn>	im really sad because programming makes me feel retarded. almost braindamaged
<alex333333>	keypusher: but if... vara = random.randint(25,7000)          and i send_keys(vara) and then assert vara they are two different numbers
<bullhorn>	:|
<runciter>	foist: you would want to start it via ~/.virtualenvs/nap/bin/python
<zahlman>	pie_: if you're coming from another language, it may take some getting used to. but python follows a very simple rule: that which is described inside the `class` block, is part of the class.
<foist>	runciter: see http://dpaste.com/0dbvc1q
<runciter>	foist: and if aimweb_appname is installed in ~/.virtualenvs/aimweb, you would start *that* with ~/.virtualenvs/aimweb/bin/python
<runciter>	foist: so you're doing this, hm?
<nedbat>	bullhorn: 1) don't be hard on yourself.  2) don't use the r-word that way :)
<pie_>	zahlman: python is my "first" language
<runciter>	foist: something else is going on with your code, then
<foist>	hm indeed.
<keypusher>	alex333333: assert vara what?  you need to get the value from whatever the form returns and compare it to what you sent, right?
<yvear>	alex333333, example:  email_field = webdriverwait(driver, timeout).until(lambda x:x.find_element_by_id('field_email'));  email_field.send_keys(email)
<zahlman>	pie_: oh. well, probably jsut a matter of practice then. :)
<pie_>	zahlman: its not that i didnt know what i wanted, its that i just did it wrong...this time around at least...i think
<pie_>	xd yep, im hopefil
<pie_>	*hopeful
<keypusher>	hopefilled

<zahlman>	heh.
<zahlman>	relatable, yes.
<foist>	happens to everyone (i hope)
<foist>	runciter: any idea how to identify what’s going on?
<bullhorn>	i dont know if i should keep going with lpthw or try to find some other material
<pie_>	well it would suck if you were stuck in the "no clue mode" :d
<pie_>	bullhorn: tried the plain old python docs?
<runciter>	foist: i would have to see more of your code
<codingthings>	there's really an rfc for everything, im starting to notice
<runciter>	foist: also, can i see the exception/error/log/whatever that makes you think the code in one virtualenv is calling into another virtualenv?
<yvear>	alex333333, example:  current_email_field_text = email_field.text
<bullhorn>	pie_: someone said theyre not fully suitable for complete beginners
<pie_>	codingthings: i can imagine...but theyre really long no..?
<pie_>	bullhorn: take a shot. idk, but i quite like it.
<alex333333>	but it is an attribute
<codingthings>	pie_ some are hundreds of pages.
<yvear>	alex333333, http://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/api.html
<codetaku>	most rfcs are fairly readable, though a bit boring
<codetaku>	if you ever want to do something like implement an ftp server or client, hitting the rfcs should be your first stop
<yvear>	alex333333, http://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/api.html#selenium.webdriver.remote.webelement.webelement.get_attribute
<pie_>	codingthings: does reading them help with understanding things, or are they only good for writing implementations of stuff? if the former, i might have to start reading rfcs :p
<\u03b5>	codetaku: dunno, my first stop would be "can i not use ftp?"
<runciter>	pie_: writing a toy implementation from an rfc is a good way to understand things
<runciter>	it takes some time, though
<pie_>	sure.
<codetaku>	\u03b5: that actually might be a wiser question
<nedbat>	bullhorn: how are you liking lpthw so far?
<codingthings>	pie_ i would say they lean more towards writing an implementation, usually
<pie_>	so, lets hope what i found actually fixes things
<\u03b5>	second being "find existing libs"; but if you actually need to implement it... i guess...
<bullhorn>	nedbat: its been pretty good. i usually learn best by doing. but his method is to first make you write a program without explaining it... i dont know if its the best approach
<runciter>	pie_: like reading a math textbook or article or something, you really have to try out what an rfc is talking about.  just reading it isn't nearly as effective
<alex333333>	elem.send_keys(randg.randomstring).get_attribute(value) then what??
<\u03b5>	although you often also need to look at how other programs deal with the proto
<bullhorn>	im ahving issues remembering all the meaning of the words... and syntax is even worse
<\u03b5>	ie. the irc rfc is not enough
<pie_>	codingthings: i would rephrase the question, but idk how. i mean its an inherent property of rfcs to be for implementations...
<alex333333>	i don't see how to refer to that get attribute to turn it into a variable
<pie_>	runciter: sounds logical.
<codingthings>	pie_ they outline standards, you would use the standards in development. they don't usually explain why or how they arrived at the suggestions though
<\u03b5>	bullhorn: i guess he wants you to run the code, see what happens then trace what happens while looking at the program source
<nedbat>	bullhorn: if you want things to build, here's a list of ideas and other lists: http://nedbatchelder.com/text/kindling.html
<nedbat>	bullhorn: but it might be hard to get started until you get through lpthw
<bullhorn>	\u03b5: i focus so much on figuring out whats going on that im not focusing on remembering the basic things
<kingplusplus>	please anyone here ready to help a brother? i need to grasp the concept onf meta classes programming python for 2yrs still don’t get its use
<bullhorn>	i dont have problems understanding lpthw. i have issues remembering and doing stuff myself after doing it along with him
<runciter>	kingplusplus: just to satisfy your curiousity?  or do you think might need one?
<codetaku>	nedbat: do you take suggestions for additions to that page?
<nedbat>	codetaku: i do
<nedbat>	codetaku: though i have to be afk for about an hour.
<codingthings>	pie_ right now im going through rfc3106: field specifications for e-commerce.
<kirkmcdonald>	kingplusplus: a metaclass is for when you want to do stuff in response to defining a class.
<kirkmcdonald>	kingplusplus: more or less.
<kingplusplus>	runciter:  yes to satisfy my curiousity guess when you know it then you can find a way to use it
<runciter>	ok
<yvear>	alex333333, current_attr = elem.get_attribute('attr555')
<pie_>	actually...s*** schroedingers attribute, nees to be static and instance at the same time
<runciter>	kingplusplus: so let's say i have: class foo(object): pass
<\u03b5>	check out the beginning (or more) of "python 3 metaprogramming" held by david beazley
<\u03b5>	kingplusplus: ^
<runciter>	kingplusplus: if i do f = foo(), what is f?
<kingplusplus>	runciter:  object
<runciter>	kingplusplus: that's right
<codetaku>	nedbat: well hell, i was gonna recommend the matasano crypto challenges because i really enjoyed those, but you already have that... and microcorruption has to be done in assembler
<runciter>	kingplusplus: and as an object, what's its relation to the class foo?
<kingplusplus>	runciter:  not sure
<rothschild_666>	this if statement is valid right?  if int(row[6]) <> 12 or int(row[6]) <> 15:
<\u03b5>	rothschild_666: use != rather than <>
<rothschild_666>	and it should only pass if row[6] is anything but 12 or 15?
<runciter>	kingplusplus: that's ok.  does this help: "object f is an ________ of class foo"
<runciter>	kingplusplus: what's the blank?
<\u03b5>	rothschild_666: otherwise yes, it looks like valid syntax, why?
<codetaku>	rothschild_666: actually, it will always pass.  things are always either not 12 or not 15
<\u03b5>	rothschild_666: you can do    int(row[6]) not in [12, 15]     instead
<\u03b5>	yeah
<rothschild_666>	\u03b5: for some reason it is not working, it lets everything through
<codetaku>	you probably want to use == and handle the case where it is 12 or is 15 first... or put a 'not' outside a parenthesized expression
<rothschild_666>	hah oo good point
<codetaku>	rothschild_666: consider cases.  when it is 12, the first half of the expression will be false, the second half true, and you joined them with or
<rothschild_666>	darn logic on a friday afternoon ;0
<|zz|>	de morgan strikes again
<codingthings>	how would i go about validating the arg passed is valid strftime format?
<pie_>	youd think a class that suclasses another class would have its own instance of a static class attribute, but its actually the static attribute of the ancestor?
<kingplusplus>	runciter ”object f is an ________ of class foo" instance
<pie_>	because i think thats what im experiencing
<runciter>	kingplusplus: exactly!
<codetaku>	codingthings: try to use it with strftime and catch the exception
<|zz|>	if not (x==12 or x==15):  -->  if x!=12 and x!=15:
<runciter>	kingplusplus: what this really means is: we define a class foo, and that definition may include some values -- which get shared across all instances -- and some functions -- which get shared across all instances too
<codingthings>	that'll do, thanks
<codetaku>	codingthings: the general rule is 'it is better to ask for forgiveness than it is to ask for permission'
<\u03b5>	pie_: if there's one = outside of a function, there's only one actual object
<runciter>	kingplusplus: we can create an instance from a class by calling the class
<runciter>	kingplusplus: f = foo()
<kingplusplus>	runciter: sure
<pie_>	i.e. class a: b = object() ; class c(a);  a.b is c.b
<runciter>	kingplusplus: so one way to think about the relationship between instances and classes is that classes provide a template for instances
<runciter>	kingplusplus: this isn't exactly right, but it's a useful perspective for our purposes
<\u03b5>	pie_: yep. b= object() is only run once, when class a is defined
<rothschild_666>	is there a performance penalty by using row[6] not in [12, 15]?
<pie_>	\u03b5: its not completely unintuitive, but id have missed it if not for getting screwed by it
<pie_>	thanks
<\u03b5>	rothschild_666: none of any importance
<codetaku>	rothschild_666: not one you will ever notice
<runciter>	kingplusplus: because each instance will receive its *implementation* from its class.  that means you control what goes into an instance by changing its class
<runciter>	kingplusplus: so if we wnated to add a method to foo
<codetaku>	and remember:  premature optimization is the root of all evil.
<runciter>	kingplusplus: we would do: class foo: def method(self): # something
<rothschild_666>	what about just in time optimization?
<rothschild_666>	j/k
<runciter>	kingplusplus: then the instances we created thereafter  (f = foo()) would have the method (f.method())
<\u03b5>	rothschild_666: the list will actually be recognized as a constant in this particular case
<runciter>	kingplusplus: ok
<runciter>	kingplusplus: now what happens if you do foo.method ?
<runciter>	kingplusplus: in some ways it's different than doing f.method
<runciter>	kingplusplus: in some ways it's not!  the syntax is the same, for one
<\u03b5>	pie_: it involves a few axioms i guess
<kingplusplus>	runciter: well foo.method am not sure but i will run it
<runciter>	kingplusplus: it won't run the method.  neither will f.method
<runciter>	kingplusplus: it'll return a method object (unbound for the case of foo.method and bound for the case of f.method)
<runciter>	kingplusplus: try it out
<runciter>	kingplusplus: and notice how they're very similar
<kingplusplus>	ok
<\u03b5>	well foo.method just give the function on py3, an annoying object on py2
<kingplusplus>	runciter: <bound method person.get_name of <__main__.person object at 0x1005dab00>>     and <function person.get_name at 0x1005dc488>
<stormmore>	ok potential odd question of the day, i know i can get the args spec of a function but can i get the return spec too?
<runciter>	kingplusplus: they're not the same, but they don't look completely diffferent, do they?
<runciter>	kingplusplus: also, you got these similar things by the same syntax
<\u03b5>	stormmore: you can get the return annotation
<runciter>	kingplusplus: <something>.method
<runciter>	kingplusplus: and if you had something like: class foo: a = 1
<\u03b5>	stormmore: inspect.signature(obj).return_annotation if i recall
<runciter>	kingplusplus: and you did foo.a and f.a (where f = foo() again)
<kingplusplus>	runciter: yes one is  function at and the other is object at
<runciter>	kingplusplus: the result would look even *more* alike
<runciter>	kingplusplus: yes that's right, but the names are the same, they're both callables
<runciter>	kingplusplus: the relationship between that function and method object is also interesting, but outside the scope of our current discussion :)
<\u03b5>	stormmore: or is it some other kind of information that you want to get? what do you want to do with it?
<runciter>	kingplusplus: right now, i just want to point out that interacting with classes is not that different from interacting with their instances
<runciter>	kingplusplus: does that make sense?
<kingplusplus>	runciter: it does a little bit
<runciter>	kingplusplus: ok, that's good
<runciter>	kingplusplus: so if classes and their instances behave similarly
<stormmore>	building a parent class that traverses the child's functions and want to grab the names of their input and out variables so i can programmatically tell what order the functions should be run and if they can be run in parallel
<runciter>	kingplusplus: in what ways are they different?  well, classes have a special "template of" relationship with their instances, that's true
<runciter>	kingplusplus: but why couldn't classes *also* be instances?
<codingthings>	why is the first object in calendar.month_name an empty string?
<runciter>	kingplusplus: that's gonna probably sound weird, so ask some questions
<stormmore>	kinda like the how the cmd module works with do_ functions in the child class but a little bit more advanced
<\u03b5>	stormmore: yeah, i guess you'd need annotations there. maybe a simple string as return annotation naming the result variable?
<solidus-river>	grr, cto needs to stop picking services that have 0 support
<solidus-river>	this is ridiculous
<solidus-river>	how does he choose these things
<kingplusplus>	runciter: if class are instances that means we can create a class without going through conventional class a(): pass
<speaker1234>	im living the same life
<runciter>	kingplusplus: yes!!!!
<runciter>	kingplusplus: that's exactly right!
<runciter>	kingplusplus: i'll show you how to do that right now
<runciter>	kingplusplus: but first, do this
<runciter>	kingplusplus: f = foo(); print(f.__class__)
<runciter>	kingplusplus: what gets printed?
<\u03b5>	solidus-river: what's that latest service?
<stormmore>	is that a py 3 only feature \u03b5?
<solidus-river>	\u03b5: kafka
<solidus-river>	theres like ony python module with a bunch of open bugs
<solidus-river>	their irc channel is dead
<\u03b5>	stormmore: yeah, the syntax is, but it can be backported
<kingplusplus>	runciter: <class '__main__.foo'>
<solidus-river>	they have no installers for different os's
<\u03b5>	(not the syntax, just the annotations)
<runciter>	kingplusplus: what about this: print(foo.__class__)
<solidus-river>	like i would never choose this if i was him
<solidus-river>	i dont see any reason for thinking this is a good idea
<stormmore>	\u03b5: ah we are still a 2.7 house :-/
<\u03b5>	solidus-river: heh, yet another one of these
<mrelendig>	solidus-river: but it was probably the top comment in a stack exchange from 2008
<kingplusplus>	runciter:  <class 'type'>
<codetaku>	solidus-river: isn't kafka supposed to be something up and coming?  i have a vague memory of some project saying their next version was going to be called kafka...
<\u03b5>	stormmore: i wrote a lib that backports annotations if you want to be interoperable, see sigtools.modifiers.annotate
<runciter>	kingplusplus: ok, so you remember how you said: if classes are instances that means we can create a class without going through conventional class a(): pass
<runciter>	kingplusplus: if f.__class__ is foo, and calling foo() gives us f
<runciter>	kingplusplus: and foo.__class__ is type, what do you think happens if we call type()?
<kingplusplus>	runciter:  now type() has no leading class so we cant do type.__class__
<runciter>	kingplusplus: not quite.  the value of type.__class__ is interesting, and something we'll discuss a bit later
<runciter>	kingplusplus: but my point is, f.__class__ -> foo, and foo() gives us a instance of foo, f
<runciter>	kingplusplus: foo.__class__ -> type, and type() might give us what?
<kingplusplus>	runciter:  gives us type
<runciter>	kingplusplus: not quite.  it can give us foo!
<runciter>	kingplusplus: it's not as straight forward as f = foo() to get an instance of foo named f
<runciter>	kingplusplus: we'll start by creating a new foo, calls foo2, that's equivalent to: class foo2: pass
<runciter>	kingplusplus: foo2 = type('foo2', (), {})
<runciter>	kingplusplus: what is foo2?
<\u03b5>	stormmore: alternatively you can just drop a new attribute on your functions
<\u03b5>	stormmore: but yeah, signature objects are pretty neat for dealing with this stuff
<runciter>	kingplusplus: i'll explain what: type('foo2', (), {}) means in a second
<kingplusplus>	runciter:  <class '__main__.foo2'>
<runciter>	kingplusplus: yep!  and what about f2 = foo2()
<stormmore>	\u03b5: just looked at sigtools.readthedocs.org page, it looks like (in the example anyway) that it relies on returning the same arguments, what about the scenario of different input and outputs?
<kingplusplus>	runciter: <__main__.foo2 object at 0x1005dacc0>
<runciter>	kingplusplus: yep, and what's f2.__class__ ?
<voodoonofx>	when using sqlalchemy with postgres, is it ok to just use sqlalchemy.type.float in my table mapping instead of sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql.double_precision? does it automatically map it to double_precision if i'm on postgres?
<kingplusplus>	foo2
<kingplusplus>	runciter:  foo2
<runciter>	kingplusplus: yep
<\u03b5>	voodoonofx: if the closest thing to a float in postgress is double, yes
<runciter>	kingplusplus: and what's foo2.__class__ ?
<voodoonofx>	\u03b5: i've got both double precision and real fields in the same table.
<kingplusplus>	runciter: type
<runciter>	kingplusplus: right!
<runciter>	kingplusplus: so in summary: if we have class foo2 and we call it, we get an instance (maybe we'll name it f) whose __class__ is foo2
<runciter>	kingplusplus: and classes are "templates" for instances
<kingplusplus>	yes
<runciter>	kingplusplus: if we call type like so: type('foo2', (), {}), we get back a class foo2 whose __class__ is type
<runciter>	kingplusplus: so somehow, type is the "template" for classes
<runciter>	kingplusplus: in fact, it's the *class* of classes -- as much as the class of f2 is foo2
<kingplusplus>	runciter: i grasp it better
<runciter>	kingplusplus: good!  this is essential to understand metaclasses
<runciter>	kingplusplus: because a metaclass is the *class* of some class
<runciter>	kingplusplus: thus "meta" class
<\u03b5>	voodoonofx: the docs make it seem like you should indeed use the dialect-specific subclass of float for double_precision
<runciter>	kingplusplus: in python, the class of all classes -- the metaclass for all classes -- is type
<\u03b5>	voodoonofx: while real seems adequately represented by float directly
<runciter>	kingplusplus: now, why would you want such a thing
<runciter>	kingplusplus: well, we said that classes are "templates" for instances
<kingplusplus>	yeah
<runciter>	kingplusplus: so one practical benefit is that we can have a template for classes
<runciter>	kingplusplus: let's say we want to add class level attribute -- a = 1 -- to a bunch of classes
<runciter>	kingplusplus: we could do: class first: a = 1; class second: a = 1
<runciter>	kingplusplus: what a pain!
<runciter>	kingplusplus: but we know how to create a class now
<runciter>	kingplusplus: we could do something like
<runciter>	kingplusplus: http://codepad.org/m0hjysu6
<runciter>	kingplusplus: or more helpfully http://codepad.org/0dnzjbzp
<runciter>	(mro() here means, show me the base classes for first)
<runciter>	kingplusplus: this is a very silly example, obviously -- we could have just used inheritance (class abaseclass: a = 1; class first(abaseclasse): pass)
<nedbat>	codetaku: thanks for the ideas anyway.
<runciter>	kingplusplus: that's because we know everything there is to know about abaseclass before we run the program
<runciter>	kingplusplus: things get more interested when we want to make a decision at runtime
<runciter>	interesting*
<codetaku>	nedbat: i love programming challenge sites like those you listed, i'm checking out codewars now
<runciter>	kingplusplus: so with a different syntax, that i'll explain in a moment, we'd be able to write a metaclass that adds 1 to each of its class's "a" attribute
<runciter>	kingplusplus: but to explain that syntax, we have to talk a little more about what type does
<codetaku>	a little annoyed that they only let you use python 2.7 though... i'm used to 3 and it's already bitten me, code failed a test with a memory error because i needed to use xrange rather than range
<runciter>	kingplusplus: type is actually how python creates classes
<runciter>	kingplusplus: and type *creates* classes -- it doesn't initialize them
<stormmore>	\u03b5: i am considering just using getsourcelines from the inspect module and requiring the last line be a return line with a very specific format
<runciter>	kingplusplus: that's an important distinction.  i'm sure you've written plenty of __init__ methods for your classes where you set instance variables
<runciter>	kingplusplus: and you never ever return something from that __init__ method
<runciter>	kingplusplus: also, its first argument is "self", which is an instance of that class
<kingplusplus>	runciter: yes i have
<kingplusplus>	yes
<runciter>	kingplusplus: so this is *initialization* -- something else created an instance of your class, and is giving it to your __init__ as the self arg
<runciter>	kingplusplus: and now you can set variables on it
<runciter>	kingplusplus: what created 'self', the instance of your class?
<runciter>	kingplusplus: type did!
<nedbat>	stormmore: i've missed the discussion, but what you just said sounds fascinating....
<kingplusplus>	runciter: hmmm makes sense
<runciter>	kingplusplus: now, you can customize the *creation* of a class in the same way you can customize its initialization
<nedbat>	stormmore: what do you need to know about the return statement?
<runciter>	kingplusplus: you very rarely do this, though
<runciter>	kingplusplus: most of the time, you get, via your class' inheriting from type, a default implementation of the creation logic
<runciter>	kingplusplus: it's accessible on your classes as __new__
<runciter>	kingplusplus: __new__ gets called to *create* an instance of a class, and it's usually just taken from type
<runciter>	kingplusplus: ok
<runciter>	kingplusplus: so remember how type is a class?  foo2.__class__ is type
<runciter>	kingplusplus: you can inherit from type!
<runciter>	it's just a class
<runciter>	kingplusplus: and now you can override __new__ in your subclass of type
<runciter>	kingplusplus: then, if you plug this into some class that inherits from object (explicitly in python 2 and implicitly in python 3)
<runciter>	kingplusplus: *that* __new__ method will be called to create the instance of the *class*
<runciter>	kingplusplus: http://codepad.org/xckharwj
<runciter>	kingplusplus: there's a lot going on in there, so ask questions!
<runciter>	kingplusplus: this is different from the syntax for attaching a metaclass to a class in python 3
<runciter>	kingplusplus: that's like: someclass(metaclass=thing): pass
<runciter>	but it's the same mechanism
<kingplusplus>	runciter:  python 3 uses class meta: var = ‘literal’
<kingplusplus>	right?
<runciter>	hm?
<runciter>	kingplusplus: for which part?
<kingplusplus>	__metaclass__ = thing
<runciter>	ah
<runciter>	no, it's
<runciter>	class someclass(metaclass=thing)
<\u03b5>	stormmore: yeah, that's not very flexible but you could do it. you need to consider multiple return points too
<\u03b5>	stormmore: sigtools.modifiers.annotate makes very few assumptions, i'm not sure what you're referring to
<\u03b5>	nedbat: i understand he wants to piece functions together automatically based on their input arguments / return specs
<stormmore>	\u03b5: yeah i thought about multiple return points but sometimes you do have to put restrictions in, e.g. in the cmd module the commands required to start with do_ or help with help_
<stormmore>	\u03b5: the example far to basic to see what you really (or i would hope it would) can do with it
<\u03b5>	those are fairly light restrictions in comparison to return points. if the name must start with do_, then you make sure your functions names start with it and their users too
<\u03b5>	one return point changes the way you write functions
<\u03b5>	stormmore: annotate and python annotations are really just ways to attach arbitrary data to functions
<pikaro>	i'm regularly uploading files to an ftp server on a free webhost with ftplib as outlined here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12613797/python-script-uploading-files-via-ftp . my problem is that the user i upload it to (created specifically for one site) gets 'quota exceeded' errors after a while, but my main user's quota accurately reflects how much data the server really contains. am i doing anything wrong here? or does the
<pikaro>	host simply implement quota in such a way as to prevent automated uploads or upload bandwidth per day or similar?
<pikaro>	unfortunately, i don't have any kind of control panel to speak of, just ftp - might there be some temporary files created somewhere etc?
<stormmore>	\u03b5: i could potential parse getsourcelines for all return lines and then parse those but i really would think for safety checks there would only be 1 "successful" return and all other returns would be for failures
<\u03b5>	stormmore: one usually uses exceptions for failures
<runciter>	stormmore: it's better that you would mark a function in such a way that you know if it's parallelizable or not
<stormmore>	\u03b5: true, then it would be a case of potentially different sets of return arguments which could cause different functions to be fired off
<runciter>	stormmore: mainly because i can do if datetime.datetime.now().day % 2: return something
<runciter>	i mean, obviously not that arbitrary
<stormmore>	runciter: yeah that would be nice if i was the one responsible for writing the fucntions. i am trying to build a module kinda like the cmd module but for safety checks that my team does manually right now
<runciter>	stormmore: what's "dependencies" mean?
<\u03b5>	stormmore: then that's a design decision to make. it shifts the decision of which functions to call from being a static decision to a dynamic one (you need to reevaluate it depending on what has been returned)
<\u03b5>	i wouldn't opt for the latter
<runciter>	stormmore: if you're not actually running the python code, every analysis option available to you is effectively a heuristic
<stormmore>	runciter: say a function returns a variable called named, the module needs to know that any other function will get the value of named if one of the arguments is called named
<runciter>	stormmore: definitely declare what that function provides somewhere
<darkelement>	hey guys i'm having some trouble removing quotes and brackets from some strings, here is an example: ['can be either']. i have used re.sub and replace but it is coming up on errors whenever i try this.
<wooble>	darkelement: show the code and the full tracebacks.
<wooble>	(in a pastebin like the one in /topic)
<darkelement>	yep, sec
<dejan>	hi all, i am trying to run examples from https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html , and i am having errors with those examples that use asyncio.ensure_future() . i am getting the following error: attributeerror: 'module' object has no attribute 'ensure_future'
<dejan>	any ideas why?
<dejan>	even this simple example fails with the same error: http://codepad.org/5iaomspw
<veverak>	hmm
<wooble>	dejan: i don't know, but that function doesn't appear to exist.
<dejan>	wooble, at first i thought it is me, that i did something stupid...
<dcrosta>	dejan https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.ensure_future "new in 3.4.4"
<dcrosta>	what version are you running?
<dcrosta>	(what version of python3, that is)
<dejan>	dcrosta, crap, 3.4.3 :(
<veverak>	let's say i have group of "modules" in one object ... point is that it can happend that one module needs different one and that module is not present...
<veverak>	what is bes reaction?
<veverak>	throw exception?
<dejan>	dcrosta, thanks mate!
<dcrosta>	happy to help :)
<veverak>	return "none" and check for none in each line of code?
<dejan>	dcrosta, but it is in documentation for 3.4.3 ffs...
<dcrosta>	well, that's a totally valid point :)
<moldy>	veverak: you must decide
<wooble>	dejan: yeah, i have no idea why docs.python.org has docs for unreleased stuff. the 2.7 docs point to 2.7.10rc1 too. :/
<moldy>	veverak: we cannot tell without knowing more about your situation
<veverak>	moldy: creating brain for my robot
<veverak>	https://scontent-ams.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/v/t34.0-12/11267127_1010751672269551_994073063_n.jpg?oh=cc3264e5b23ad683679a71e5ac20629e&oe=555c20d3
<veverak>	this is actual idea
<veverak>	point is that each module should be something that can be stopped, started and sometimes not even present
<veverak>	when one module depends on different one, he should deal with it
<darkelement>	http://paste.pound-python.org/show/hhuitgtaw4a9vpozrqgq/
<darkelement>	there you go
<wooble>	darkelement: response isn't a string, it's a list.
<veverak>	exceptions it is
<darkelement>	wooble, alright
<barneygale>	darkelement, additionally, you're probably looking for mystring.replace('foo', 'bar'), not re.sub('foo', 'bar', mystring)
<barneygale>	`re` is the regular expression module, and "[" is not a valid regex.
<darkelement>	ok
<wooble>	'\[' is... but this sounds like an xy problem. you don't want to remove [ and ' from a list, you want to print the individual elements.
<darkelement>	wooble, yea that's a good idea
<wooble>	if you want commas, use print ', '.join(your_list)
<darkelement>	it is working now, but thanks!
<darkelement>	small change was needed
<darkelement>	just index of the list instead of list
<ludwig_^>	hi, guys. i'm wondering how to parse this: https://bpaste.net/show/a8c6fc2d10f0 - i want to grep the name "summa eget kapital" and save the value "332483000" in a variable. i'm new to python and experiencing some difficulties. appreciate the help :-)
