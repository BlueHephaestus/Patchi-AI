<DarkElement>	Hey guys why was ihatehex banned?
<_W_>	because he cannot control himself when he feels he is being insulted
<DarkElement>	Ok, like what happened
<DarkElement>	That caused him to be banned
<_W_>	<ihatehex> I didn't just hit her and quit it, ^python111_, I called her, I asked her out for another date, so don't worry about me 'using' your mom for sex
<_W_>	was the last one
<_W_>	but repeated outbursts and no effect from prolonged quiets, as well as an attitude that shows it will just continue, was what got him banned
<DarkElement>	that message doesnt seem to bad, since it was obviously a joke, but I understand
<DarkElement>	too*
<_W_>	I think it was neither an obvious joke, nor made without malice
<_W_>	and even if it somehow was, still entirely inappropriate
<_W_>	<ihatehex> oh come on, he was flaming me multiple times and I responded once
<DarkElement>	Hmm
<_W_>	this after the one and only negative comment was <^python111_> ihatehex, fkin pleb 
<DarkElement>	Sounds like he tried to fight fire with fire
<_W_>	sounds like that would continue
<DarkElement>	Yea, maybe
<DarkElement>	Well, thanks
<DarkElement>	See ya
