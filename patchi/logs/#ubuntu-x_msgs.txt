<karolherbst> small question: why does a "service ligthdm start" forces everything to my nvidia card allthough i have bumblebee installed and set the alternatives through update-alternatives to mesa (which gets set to nvidia through the service start again) in 15.04?
<karolherbst> it worked with 14.04 and 14.10 without problems
