<DarkElement>	how can I connect to the internet with my arch linux on vmware
<DarkElement>	I have checked ip link and lspci and I know that I have a wireless card ready
<halosghost>	what are you using to connect to the wifi?
<DarkElement>	I'm not able to connect to the wifi
<DarkElement>	as far as i can tell
<DarkElement>	I was unable to use pacman to install programs,however
<MrElendig>	what card?
<DarkElement>	ip link returns (1)lo and (2) eno16777736
<DarkElement>	however none of the iwconfig, ipconfig commands are installed
<MrElendig>	ipconfig is not a gnu/linux thing
<DarkElement>	ifconfig
<halosghost>	ifconfig is deprecated
<MrElendig>	ifconfig was deprecated over a decade ago
<DarkElement>	ok what do i do then
<MrElendig>	connect the wired network since you forgot to install the wifi tools
<MrElendig>	or boot the install image again, set up network, chroot in, install what you need
<DarkElement>	how can I connect to the wired network?
<DarkElement>	with ethernet, or commands you mean
<DarkElement>	gonna assume ethernet, in which case i will connect when home
<MrElendig>	dhcpcd eno1
<halosghost>	<tab>

-NickServ-	You are now identified for DarkElement.
<DarkElement>	MrElendig, back at home, however even with a wired connection im not able to install with pacman because of connection failure
<fsckd>	DarkElement: does host work?
<DarkElement>	command not found 
<DarkElement>	for "host"
<fsckd>	i mean in the host
<fsckd>	does the host's network work?
<DarkElement>	yea
<fsckd>	so just in vmware?
<DarkElement>	yep, just with archlinux as well, I am able to connect with my ubuntu vm
<fsckd>	ok, i have never used vmware with Linux
<fsckd>	from arch can you ping 8.8.8.8 ?

<kyusaki_>	Good morning everyone 
*	gehidore pings fsckd.fsckd.fsckd.fsckd
<sniper338>	Gud afternoon :)
<gehidore>	ya
<colbyftp>	I want to install yaurt, but need to install package-query 1st
<colbyftp>	use wget not installed
<colbyftp>	sudo pacman -S wget databse for wget does not exist
<colbyftp>	is there another way from base to download wget
*	ChanServ gives voice to crankyop
<colbyftp>	everytime i think I resolve an issue another presents itself :)...am I understading this right, to use makepkg. I hould set up a tmp folder somewnere for my builds, and cp then modify the PKDEST variable to point the new temp dir I set up
<Namarrgon>	what are you trying to do? just build an AUR/ABS package?
*	ChanServ gives voice to tigr
<colbyftp>	install package-query, I just did a fresh install and added basic XFCE and sound now I want to install yauoart
<colbyftp>	Plus I want to do most through termianl so I will learn more
<Namarrgon>	Get the tarball from the aur, extract it to a build-directory. Then look through the PKGBUILD and .install to make sure they aren't doing anything stupid.
<Namarrgon>	Then build/install with makepkg.
*	ChanServ gives voice to tigrmesh
<colbyftp>	makepkg returns ==> ERROR: PKGBUILD does not exist.
<Namarrgon>	You have to run makepkg in the directory with the PKGBUILD.
<Namarrgon>	Go through the makepkg page on the wiki, just in case i forgot to mention something.
<colbyftp>	I think I may have resolved, I found a install in the tar:-
<colbyftp>	 Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
<colbyftp>	configure, build, and install this package.
<Namarrgon>	yup
<colbyftp>	sry:)
<Namarrgon>	Also look for source=, it should download from a legitimate source.
<colbyftp>	np thanks
<colbyftp>	so now to download and install octopi, see if I have learnt anything :)

<nawarch>	buenos dias tengo una pregunta
<nawarch>	resulta que al actualizar mi arch quedo con el ultimo kernel pero ahora no tengo conexion a wifi, nisiquiera me aparece la interface he usado iwconfig para ver las interfaces

<colbyftp>	anyone know how I could app spotify to XFCE systray
<fsckd>	this perhaps? https://community.spotify.com/t5/Help-Desktop-Linux-Mac-and/What-happened-to-quot-Minimize-to-tray-quot-option/td-p/1042139
<phrik>	Title: What happened to "Minimize to tray" option ?? - The Spotify Community (at community.spotify.com)
<colbyftp>	ah that explains it. Thanks
<colbyftp>	well that means I will install https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mopidy-spotify/
<phrik>	Title: AUR (en) - mopidy-spotify (at aur.archlinux.org)
<colbyftp>	sry guys, decided to use yaourt, but I keep getting Unable to open file: /usr/local/etc/pacman.conf
<colbyftp>	on the net it say to edit /etc/profile and put /usr/bin 1st in the path line but still no dif
<Namarrgon>	how did you install yaourt?
<colbyftp>	i can't remember tbh
<colbyftp>	should I remove and reinstall
<colbyftp>	r create a syslink ...
<fsckd>	create a symlink? why?
<fsckd>	if i had to guess, you installed something outside of pacman. that's a no no.
<colbyftp>	so when it goes looking in the wrong dir it will link over to the right file?? noob here just guessing
<colbyftp>	anything I have installed has been either pacman or direct from AUR using makepkg
<fsckd>	yaourt shouldn't be looking in /usr/local
<colbyftp>	except the 'query' dependant for yaourt which i insalled using .config/make/make install
<fsckd>	ahh there you go
<fsckd>	that's why you're have that problem. you installed package-query outside of pacman
<colbyftp>	ahh ok
<fsckd>	not using pacman makes things harder as you have to do things by hand. :/
<colbyftp>	brand new so was trying to do everything manually oops any idea how I shoud correct
<fsckd>	you have to find the files, remove them, then install package-query with makepkg+pacman
<colbyftp>	this is what I do now, let me know if I am doing it right
<colbyftp>	wget file from AUR
<colbyftp>	extract cd into dir   makepkg -si
<colbyftp>	thts it
<fsckd>	that's the correct way
<colbyftp>	ok just fecked up right at the start
<fsckd>	hehe, no worries. better to learn this lesson on something simple. i once installed xen outside the package manager. never again. ><
<colbyftp>	lol I can imagine
<fsckd>	most likely the files are dumped under /usr/local. so shouldn't be hard to find its stuff.
<fsckd>	don't remove everything from /usr/local. only remove the package-query stuff
<colbyftp>	../usr/local/bin has package-query, no where esle in local does
<fsckd>	one moment
<colbyftp>	Reinstall package-query using empty --prefix ./configure --prefix=
<fsckd>	don't
<colbyftp>	somwone has shared that
<colbyftp>	I wont
<fsckd>	ahh ok
<fsckd>	ok i have a list of files
<colbyftp>	cool thank you for helping me
<fsckd>	(i built and "installed" it, to under /tmp like i was packaging)
<fsckd>	only two files i think
<colbyftp>	lets hope so
<fsckd>	/usr/local/bin/package-query
<fsckd>	/usr/local/share/man/man8/package-query.8
<DarkElement>	so guys when you install arch on vmware using an iso, do you need to download any network stuff? I can't connect.
<colbyftp>	try changing virtual box settings to bridged
<Namarrgon>	DarkElement: no, 'base' has all you need for dhcp/static
<fsckd>	colbyftp: also if you can, please share the output of `tree /usr/local` in a pastebin service
<colbyftp>	in order bin etc games lib man sbin share src
<colbyftp>	ah ok
<colbyftp>	tree a command
<DarkElement>	Namarrgon, I can't download anything with pacman, and I believe I installed base. It is giving unable to connect errors, any ideas?
<colbyftp>	DarkElement: change VB settings to bridged under network
<Namarrgon>	DarkElement: what gives your errors?
<Namarrgon>	pacstrap?
<colbyftp>	fsckd: http://pastebin.com/RDgmWcvY
<phrik>	Title: [colbyf@localhost local]$ tree /usr/local /usr/local |-- bin |-- etc |-- gam - Pastebin.com (at pastebin.com)
<DarkElement>	colbyftp: ahh, thats right
<DarkElement>	Namarrgon: one sec
<fsckd>	colbyftp: looks like it is all gone :)
<fsckd>	colbyftp: install package-query like normal
<colbyftp>	fsckd: I changed /etc/profile around, shoudl I change it back 1st
<fsckd>	what changes did you make?
<colbyftp>	just the path, changed the order thats all
<colbyftp>	PATH="/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin"
<fsckd>	it might not matter. you can change it back if you'd like, or keep it
<colbyftp>	i think sbin was 1st and /usr/vin was last
<fsckd>	yeah, mine has /usr/bin last
<fsckd>	and sbin first
<colbyftp>	cool, changed back to normal then 
<fsckd>	probably should have stuff under local first
<colbyftp>	ok installed again just have to remember what I was doing lol
<fsckd>	hehe
<colbyftp>	wooohoooo thankyou :) its make it past that error :)
<fsckd>	yay, congrats. and you are welcome. :)
<colbyftp>	what does enter no of packages to be installed mean?
<colbyftp>	options 1 2 3
<colbyftp>	got it, it was difficult to make sense of when only 1 package appeared
<swift110_>	hey
<meskarune>	hai
<DarkElement>	back guys, and making it a bridge network did not solve the issue
<DarkElement>	I still cannot resolve host.
<fsckd>	DarkElement: can you ping 8.8.8.8?
<DarkElement>	unreachable
<Namarrgon>	have you set up your network?
*	gehidore pings fsckd.fsckd.fsckd.fsckd
<gehidore>	doh bad up arrow
<gehidore>	fsckd: are you on 8.8.8.8 for your dns?
<ANGRYSTEVE>	8.8.8.8 is evil!
*	gehidore waas serious in this question.
<DarkElement>	friend remote connected and it's working alright now, ty!
<Namarrgon>	were you told what to do?
<DarkElement>	just needed to do dhcpcd
<Namarrgon>	just 'dhcpcd'?
<DarkElement>	yep :P
<Namarrgon>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners%27_guide#Wired
<phrik>	Title: Beginners' guide - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<Namarrgon>	do it properly
<DarkElement>	yea, ill download wireless :D
<Namarrgon>	what?
<DarkElement>	stuff for wireless connections
<Namarrgon>	you have to enable the service to make it persist across reboots
<DarkElement>	ok
<Namarrgon>	wifi in a vm?
<DarkElement>	thought thats what you meant, but I realize my mistake
<DarkElement>	:|
<fsckd>	gehidore: nope

<spechter>	i've already read the log, but fixing errors with missing fonts didn't help
<Cheese>	Did it give you an error number?
<spechter>	i don't think so
<spechter>	i will check after a quick restart
<spechter>	no, it didn't give me a error number
<spechter>	and running mkfontdir in the given directory fixed it so far
<spechter>	there is one warning left about opening ACPI failed for a missing directory
<Cheese>	Well sounds like you know more than me.
<Cheese>	I just had a problem with xorg giving me error 1
<Cheese>	Reinstalled the video driver and it worked
<spechter>	ok, i will try that
<Cheese>	Not sure i would listen to me. I dont even know if is working. I run startx and i get a black screen. I run startx 'openbox sessions' and get a black screen

<Cheese>	Not sure if im doing this right. startx run /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc,  gives me a black screen
<fsckd>	the default xinitrc starts twm and xterm. you need the packages for both of those installed
<Cheese>	Ahhh...  I see....
<Cheese>	So if i decide to skip those andn
<fsckd>	make your own ~/.xinitrc
<Cheese>	And just run open box would there be problem
<fsckd>	no problem. but you have to make your own xinitrc

<spechter>	when running startx  now i get no errors shown in terminal
<spechter>	and when reading the logs in /var/log/Xorg.0.log it say adding PC Speaker and next line is closing several evdev
<fsckd>	spechter: share the full log please
<blahdodo>	anybody have any ideas how to stop dropped packets in kvm guest - tried "sudo ethtool -K eth0 tx off sg off tso off ufo off gso off gro off" no joy
<tigrmesh>	Cheese, the other thing pacman will do for you is show you what's installed.  as much as possible, package everything and install it with your package manager
<tigrmesh>	so when you find something awesome that depends on a certain version of a package, you can see whether it's installed
<spechter>	http://fpaste.org/220289
<phrik>	Title: #220289 • Fedora Project Pastebin (at fpaste.org)
<spechter>	there is my most recent log
<fsckd>	spechter: no errors, how are you starting it?
<Cheese>	So (+ti pacman -Ss openbox
<Cheese>	pacman -Ss openbox doesnt seem to work
<Cheese>	Something about config file ..... Mirriorlist..... Core not recognized
<fsckd>	Cheese: sorry, not Ss as that searches, just S by itself
<fsckd>	see: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman#Installing_packages
<phrik>	Title: pacman - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<Cheese>	Ok that makes more sense. Ive done that. I thought it was another command or something. I have like 0 experience in the command line. Its taken me a week to get this to boot up.
<fsckd>	ahh, if i may ask, what did you use before?
<Cheese>	Osx and windows
<fsckd>	oh i see. osx is technically unix but one can go without ever using the command line
<Cheese>	Yea... That was. Me just point and click
<fsckd>	what made you chose arch?
<fsckd>	choose*
<Cheese>	After upgrading to Yosemite my computer got even slower. Im over all the crap they bundle with the os. I like the idea of arch keeping it simple and that you only install what you want. Plus i thought building it from the ground up would be a good learning experience
<fsckd>	yeah, it can be a good learning experience. you've dived in. :)
<fsckd>	arch isn't hard if one perseveres and tried to learn. it isn't intended for beginners but it isn't impossible for beginners.
<Cheese>	The more I play with it the more I'll understand and the easier it will get.
<Cheese>	Plus there is so much info out there for it.
<Cheese>	And support
<fsckd>	hehe, i'm told the wiki is the best. when i started using arch, gentoo's wiki was the best.
<Cheese>	The wiki is till pretty heavy right now but its definitely helpful

<tigrmesh>	spechter1, hi
<tigrmesh>	spechter1, is it still broken?
<colbyftp>	hey folks, have a combi bluetooth/wifi card on my HP laptop. The wifi works ok, but not Bluetooth, when using Ubuntu I was able to download drivers and kernel update for it. Can I do this in Arch...
<colbyftp>	rtl8723be  <<<< is the name of the device
<fsckd>	there might be something in the AUR
<fsckd>	there are other Arch users with the same problem https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=194053
<phrik>	Title: Bluetooth not working / Newbie Corner / Arch Linux Forums (at bbs.archlinux.org)
<tigrmesh>	what do you use the bluetooth for?
<colbyftp>	I use it for my beats pill
<spechter1>	tigrmesh yes, even if it seems like i come closer to a soultion
<spechter1>	right now it looks like i'm just missing some fonts for a config file for bspwm i got from github
<spechter1>	but i'm not sure how to read those lines
<spechter1>	urxvt*font: -*-neep-medium-r-semicondensed-*-11-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
<MrElendig>	use xft instead
<MrElendig>	imo
<MrElendig>	asuming it is a ttf/otf font
<spechter1>	so replacing urxvt*font with urxvt*xft ?
<fsckd>	example from mine: URxvt.font: xft:Droid Sans Mono Dotted:bold:size=9
<fsckd>	you would keep urxvt*font and replace the right side
<spechter1>	ok, i will try it
<spechter1>	btw when i startx it doesn't crahs immediately but shows an xsessin
<spechter1>	but the background i set with hsetroot in my .xinitrc is not shown
<fsckd>	what de or wm?
<spechter1>	and none of my sxhkd shortcuts is working
<spechter1>	bspwm
<spechter1>	both bspwm and sxhkd are installed from the official repository if i remember correctly
<MrElendig>	post your xinitrc
<spechter1>	one moment
<MrElendig>	use bpaste.net or similar
<MrElendig>	not pastebin.com
<spechter1>	it's on fpaste.org
<spechter1>	http://fpaste.org/220420
<phrik>	Title: #220420 • Fedora Project Pastebin (at fpaste.org)
<spechter1>	shall i upload my .Xressources aswell ?
<spechter1>	there are all those fonts for urxvt defined
<spechter1>	in my panel config i found some declarations of fonts
<spechter1>	and the comment above says xft is not supported yet
<spechter1>	so how is this sytax i've posted before called ?
<spechter1>	maybe it will work if i modify this or atleast understand it
<MrElendig>	xfontsel
<MrElendig>	but if your panel doesn't support xft then get a less crappy panel
<MrElendig>	since it is not 1982 anymore
<spechter>	well, for now i've loaded my saved config files
<spechter>	i wlll give it a try in the upcoming week and add it module by module
<tigrmesh>	MrElendig!  Total extended memory: 1982 MB.  would you set the UMA Frame Buffer Size to 64 MB or 128 ?
<tigrmesh>	MrElendig, you personally.  supports 32MB too, but that causes bad flicker

<DarkElement>	Anyone know how to install vmblock?
<DarkElement>	I can't run vmware-user without it.
<MrElendig>	tigrmesh: as high as possible probably
<tigrmesh>	ok
<tigrmesh>	thanks
<Namarrgon>	DarkElement: are you using the open-vm-tools package?
<DarkElement>	Yea it shouldbe that
<Namarrgon>	why do you need vmblock then?
<DarkElement>	so i can run vmware-user 
<DarkElement>	And I need to run that to change my resolution.
<Namarrgon>	no, vmblock has nothing to do with the resolution
<MrElendig>	tigrmesh: if running X etc
<DarkElement>	Well I can't run vmware-user without it.
<Namarrgon>	you only needed it for d&d support but it was replaced by a fuse module
<DarkElement>	How can I install vmblock
<Namarrgon>	you can't
<DarkElement>	what do i do instae
<Namarrgon>	what error do you get?
<DarkElement>	instead.
<DarkElement>	it's telling me that /proc/fs/vmblock/dev is unable to be accessed, and that is because it's not there
<Namarrgon>	how are you starting it?
<DarkElement>	test
<DarkElement>	./usr/bin/vmware-user and vmware-user both give this.
<DarkElement>	sorry
<DarkElement>	forgot about "/"
<Namarrgon>	where did you get 'vmware-user' from?
<Namarrgon>	open-vm-tools doesn't contain it
<DarkElement>	please just help me get over this problem
<Namarrgon>	that's what i'm trying to do
<DarkElement>	I'm trying to set up vmware tools, and i have to run that command in order to change resolution.
<Namarrgon>	have you enabled and started the service as the wiki said?
<DarkElement>	enabled and started vmware tools? yes I believe it is running
<Namarrgon>	and the one?
<Namarrgon>	*the other
<DarkElement>	the other what
<Namarrgon>	service
<DarkElement>	which service are you referrring to? vmware tools should be running, I just need to get vmware user working in order to do things I need to do

<DarkElement>	alright, do you know the shortcut to open terminal in dwm
<Namarrgon>	mod+return or mod+shift+return, don't remember the default
<Namarrgon>	it should be in config.h and config.h.mk
<DarkElement>	mod being alt
<DarkElement>	right?
<Namarrgon>	was that a question?
<Namarrgon>	yes, alt
<DarkElement>	I ask because that doesnt' work, i've tried it.
<DarkElement>	:P
<Namarrgon>	do you have the terminal installed?
<DarkElement>	yea
<DarkElement>	Friend opened it earlier, i just never asked shortcut
<Namarrgon>	{ MODKEY|ShiftMask,             XK_Return, spawn,          {.v = termcmd } },
<Namarrgon>	that's the default, i don't know which version you are using
<Namarrgon>	and the default terminal is 'st'
<Namarrgon>	you might want to switch to a wm with a more accessible config
<halosghost>	lol
<halosghost>	it's true dwm takes a bit of doing to understand the config
<fsckd>	DarkElement: just so you know, in arch service usually means a systemd service
<DarkElement>	fsckd:alright
<DarkElement>	why does "st" not work....:*(
<Namarrgon>	you are sure you have it installed?
<Namarrgon>	it's not in the official repos
<DarkElement>	it's good now
<DarkElement>	friend got on, just did alt+p and started up terminator

<typh00nz>	I thought it
<typh00nz>	ll bring issues 
<typh00nz>	but I havent noticed yet
<Namarrgon>	if at all it'll be smaller issues
<typh00nz>	Do you recommend using ssd for archlinux?
<typh00nz>	Wiki is near empty about this
<Namarrgon>	_i_ recommend an ssd for everything
<typh00nz>	gives only info about reducing input output operations

<typh00nz>	what about firmware

<typh00nz>	I dont remember exact models
<typh00nz>	but some sort of them uses additional software 
<typh00nz>	distributed for [ofc] windows platform
<Namarrgon>	you won't need the software, see if they offer linux tools or isos for fw-updates
<typh00nz>	fw = firmware?
<Namarrgon>	yeah
<typh00nz>	what is isos?
<Namarrgon>	i mean bootable images in general

<typh00nz>	intel models look safe and stable
<typh00nz>	aha
<typh00nz>	and last, more practical question
<typh00nz>	Is 128GB enough for system [I cant afford bigger atm] + hdd for media things
<typh00nz>	or do would you recommend to wait, spare some more cash and buy bigger on
<typh00nz>	one
<Namarrgon>	128 just for arch?

<tigrmesh>	there may be a spotify or .spotify file or folder somewhere in your home directory
<tigrmesh>	if you have locate/mlocate installed, and the db is up-to-date, you can run  locate spotify | grep home 
<tigrmesh>	which will find every file on your system that has the string "spotify" and then select the ones that also have the string "home" - which should pretty much be only your home directory
