<coolthingy500>	what do you guys think of this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_lhqg_p21k
<sudokode>	i hate it
<dacoit>	cant make it past frame 1
<sudokode>	there are frames?
<sudokode>	oh let me click it
<sudokode>	yep still hate it
<dacoit>	trust your instincts
<coolthingy500>	well matt video and other videos he makes has quite a few beginner mistakes. for someone who has been use gnu/linux longer then me
<coolthingy500>	sudo being one, and his configs
<braindamage>	!gnu video
<phrik>	braindamage: gnu/video
<sudokode>	dacoit: guy is using sophos
<braindamage>	!gnu mistakes
<phrik>	braindamage: gnu/mistakes
<coolthingy500>	ya. there is a thing called false postives.
<dacoit>	sudokode: how can you tell
<sudokode>	dacoit: he's currently talking about it
<sudokode>	he's demo'ing it on some malware on his system
<coolthingy500>	i doubt it's malware.
<sudokode>	how it got on his system is probably his fault, but okay
<dacoit>	oh i'm a dick, so i didnt actually watch
<sudokode>	he's somehow installed a trojan
<sudokode>	two trojans
<dacoit>	gotta queue this up, sounds good
<sudokode>	some sort of software he installed, probably outside of the package manager
<sudokode>	it's great so far
<coolthingy500>	i don't know why he does this stuff.
<sudokode>	coolthingy500: thanks for this
<sudokode>	this is golden
<coolthingy500>	ya. a list of what not to do.
<sudokode>	omg
<sudokode>	omg
<sudokode>	the viruses are in an app he installed to run on wine
<coolthingy500>	ya
<sudokode>	lol
<coolthingy500>	i said that before on manjaro
<dacoit>	all the fun of windows... except even shittier than windows.
<sudokode>	so it's a windows virus
<sudokode>	...
<coolthingy500>	pretty much.,
<sudokode>	what's the point of this exercise again?
<dacoit>	myth busting!
<dacoit>	who ya gonna call?
<sudokode>	he doesn't seem to realize he's not infected
<coolthingy500>	he is giving out false info. the irony runs stong with this one.
<coolthingy500>	this is the same guy who installed arch, but keeps expectations about gnu/linux running hardware that's not even made to run.
<coolthingy500>	dll file extensions can sometimes not work in wine

<sudokode>	well there's the first in probably many comments i'm gonna end up writing
<coolthingy500>	he is right about some things.
<caleb>	lulz
<caleb>	that intro is epic
<caleb>	lol
<coolthingy500>	not enough though.
<sudokode>	that's the problem
<sudokode>	when you're right about some things, people think you're right about everything
<caleb>	indeed
<dacoit>	i would follow if i knew how g+ worked
<sudokode>	dacoit: it's a comment on the video as well :p
<coolthingy500>	it''s understandable that people make mistakes. but mistakes like this can be avoided.
<dacoit>	this is like hilarious logic. "if linux doesnt need to be defragmented" ... who is this addressed to?
<caleb>	lulz
<caleb>	and they are all windows files
<sudokode>	my biggest problem is he thinks he's revealing something here that a lot of people don't know
<dacoit>	some retarded sandman
<dacoit>	sandbag
<dacoit>	whatever that idiom is
<sudokode>	teabag?
<dacoit>	strawman!!!
<dacoit>	lol
<sudokode>	lol wow
<coolthingy500>	and a good example of that.
<coolthingy500>	more then one though
<caleb>	so what was the program he was using
<tom^>	caleb: 1. uuids are stored in the superblock and is generated upon fs creation. so when it doesnt boot its because initramfs is missing something, his sata/ahci modules or what ever.
<tom^>	eh coolthingy500
<nomelette>	is arch linux like regular linux except retarded?
<wildefyr>	yes
<coolthingy500>	sure. go with that.
<sheep>	nomelette: define 'regular linux'
<tom^>	nomelette: define retarded
<caleb>	why am i still watching this newb
<dacoit>	define linux
<nomelette>	is arch linux like regular linux except retarded?
<coolthingy500>	are you talking about a kernel?
<coolthingy500>	or the overall os all together.

<tigrmesh>	sorry
<sudokode>	caleb: lol
<caleb>	i mean tigrmesh
<sudokode>	caleb: those are his only points
<tigrmesh>	couldn't spell
<caleb>	sudokode: doesnt mean he isnt retardee
<coolthingy500>	thanks tigrmesh
<caleb>	retarded
<sheep>	it's a cross-channel troll
<sudokode>	malware, defrag, rebooting, and hard drive migration
<dacoit>	man 98%. that is high octane
<tigrmesh>	sheep, oh?
<tom^>	lol secondly you dont need to reboot unless there is a kernel update..
<sheep>	tigrmesh: it's repeating similar crap in other channels
<tom^>	just fucking restart your silly program.
<caleb>	sudokode: was that shitty imagination some windows program he was trying to use
<caleb>	tom^: yeah
<caleb>	thats exactly what i said
<caleb>	maybe not the exact words but you get the point
<coolthingy500>	defrag is pointless for arch anyways. since sysadmins wouldn't touch arch for a server anyways.
<coolthingy500>	with exceptions
<halosghost>	you kids are silly
<halosghost>	disk defragmentation is only coincidentally related to the os
<caleb>	fuck his couch
<caleb>	how about that
<tom^>	caleb for president.
<halosghost>	it's directly related to the filesystem
<caleb>	he can fragment these nuts
<dacoit>	lol.. his thinking is that  uuids are flawed because they are universally unique.
<sudokode>	caleb: i got up to 3 comments
<coolthingy500>	why the hell does he keep using sudo.
<coolthingy500>	use su
<dacoit>	!grab caleb
<phrik>	dacoit: tada!
<sudokode>	coolthingy500: no
<sheep>	sudo -i works better than su in most cases
<sudokode>	i thought it was gonna be more comments, but the video suddenly ended
<sudokode>	seems i was typing through most of it
<caleb>	you scared him
<sudokode>	lol
<sudokode>	he cut the live stream when i started commenting
<coolthingy500>	really. okay i'll have to look that up more then. sorry.
<caleb>	now he thinks youre going to send him a linux virus
<sudokode>	winzip42.exe.zip.jpg
<dacoit>	who needs selinux.. just do a find -name *.exe kids
<sheep>	.jpg? pleb.  use .png
<caleb>	looks legit
<coolthingy500>	selinux is kinda overkill. but it's nice on fedora
<sudokode>	sheep: that's the one you complain about?
<sudokode>	lol
<tom^>	sudokode: huh what live stream?
<sudokode>	tom^: wasn't one. it was a joke
<dacoit>	sudokode: too lossy
<dacoit>	:p
<sheep>	correction: use .tiff
<sudokode>	we might lose the malware
<tom^>	oh poop im gonna be late for work.
<tom^>	bai
<sudokode>	i'm gonna use .svg
<tigrmesh>	sheep, isn't one thing sudo gives that it tracks when privs are granted?
<sudokode>	boom
<sheep>	tigrmesh: that's one thing
<coolthingy500>	the comment sections is funny.
<sudokode>	`man sudo` is quite clear about what -i and -s are for
<tigrmesh>	coolthingy500, one thing sudo gives is that it tracks when privs are granted?
<tigrmesh>	oops kill the question mark at the end
<sudokode>	well, clear if you understand the implications
<coolthingy500>	okay. i get tired of using sudo, and i'm not a moron when it comes to running core changes.
<coolthingy500>	unlike mat

<seemikehack>	hey all, trying to correct the buttons for a lenovo trackpoint, i have this setting in my 50-synaptics.conf file: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/touchpad_synaptics#the_touchpad_is_not_working.2c_xorg.0.log_shows_.22query_no_synaptics:_6003c8.22 and i'm wondering if that's the issue.
<phrik>	title: touchpad synaptics - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<seemikehack>	sudokode: does my reputation precede me?
<sudokode>	finally something to do
<sudokode>	seemikehack:
<sudokode>	seemikehack: i'll handle the jokes
<dacoit>	lol
<sudokode>	lol ^
<caleb>	you bastard
<seemikehack>	...
<seemikehack>	i feel like i walked in on something.
<seemikehack>	my digital ears are burning.
<kj4>	seemikehack: you did
<seemikehack>	e-gossip about what a newb i can be sometimes?
<seemikehack>	man, must have hit the nail in the head.
<seemikehack>	welp, fire away.
<seemikehack>	*on the head, as it were.
<sudokode>	in the headddddd
<sudokode>	anyway
<sudokode>	seemikehack: pacman -qs xf86-input
<seemikehack>	sudokode: huh. neither the evdev or synaptics drivers are installed.
<seemikehack>	sudokode: the touchpad is working fine, but i suppose there's a significant amount of out-of-the-box support for that.
<seemikehack>	sudokode: and the trackpoint...points
<seemikehack>	sudokode: wait...
<seemikehack>	sudokode: am dum. they *are* installed.
<kyusaki>	hi there everyone o/
<switchy>	seemikehack, what sort of button correcting are you trying to do?
<seemikehack>	switchy: should have specified that first, the left and right click buttons occasioally operate like up and down arrows, or page up and page down, but not like left and right click buttons.
<switchy>	seemikehack, is this on a recent thinkpad?
<seemikehack>	switchy: http://www.lenovo.com/images/gallery/1060x596/lenovo-laptop-mobile-workstation-thinkpad-w550s-keyboard-3.jpg
<seemikehack>	switchy: w550s
<seemikehack>	switchy: so yes, fairly recent.
<switchy>	seemikehack, it's probably fixed in kernel 3.19.4+ (it is for me with a t450s)
<switchy>	the trackpoint/trackpad button registration is odd and handled in kernel land for when there weren't physical buttons a generation ago
<wildefyr>	any got any good recommendations for a ncurses rss feeder that displays an items url? i want to use it on my server
<switchy>	seemikehack, so uh, you could build your own stable kernel, or wait for 4.0 to hit [core]
<zer0rest>	wildefyr: newsbeuter?
<seemikehack>	seemikehack: hah. yeah, i'll deal. thanks for the tip!
<seemikehack>	sudokode: and you too, of course. i'd hate to leave you with nothing to do... ;)
<wildefyr>	zer0rest: thanks
<sudokode>	sure why not
<ponyrider>	wildefyr: yeah there are a few i have used
<ponyrider>	wildefyr: some are better than others, i think newsbeuter was the best, canto was good too
<sudokode>	rtmf... read this motherfucker?
<junka>	hello
<junka>	today, with my daily pacman -syu, i got sed: -e expression #1, char 0: no previous regular expression
<junka>	but the rest of the upgrade had no errors
<ponyrider>	post
<mjrtom>	s00pcan if you were talking about vs in my scroll back buffer, you should look at the community edition, if you haven't already
<mjrtom>	which was soon after covered...
<junka>	there is nothing really to post, everything was normal except i got that line
<rtmf>	sudokode: rainbow: the mad faerie -- but indeed
<pandb>	wow gnu screen is pretty cool
<rtmf>	pandb: tmux is cooler :-p
<pandb>	i'll check it out
<rtmf>	i hate to say that, i'm the gpl'd girl, but eh its awesome
<rtmf>	its what screen would be if you rewrote it today
<sudokode>	oic
<sudokode>	close enough
<rtmf>	mind you it still takes some learning but it does most of what you want screen to do and will spend a month tearing your hair out only to find it can't quite
<pandb>	is there away to view a process already running on one terminal, in another, without starting the original process with a special utility like screen?
<rtmf>	especially re: sharing windows between multiple tmux sessions, sharing windows among users, etc.
<rtmf>	pandb: there are a few utilities to try to shove a multiplexer under a process but not really
<pandb>	ah, shame
<rtmf>	its a big pain b/c it means reopening all of its fd's with a proxy among other things
<rtmf>	eventually any important process will live in a container and this won't matter
<pandb>	i was hoping i could just say something like xterm <pid> tty3 and be done with it
<rtmf>	pandb: me too...many times over the past 18 or so years since i learned sunos
<pandb>	haha
<rtmf>	as it stands my current head-basher is i'm trying to get my ipv6 block on linode to route between two nodes
<rtmf>	its not absolutely required but i want it
<ponyrider>	pandb: set aliases. ie: alias vlc='screen vlc'
<ponyrider>	pandb: so everytime you start vlc it will be screened. problem solved
<rtmf>	ponyrider: it helps, i use a tmux script to give me a -drr-alike command and just always shell into remote hosts to tmux
<rtmf>	..that reminds me, env needs the bash aliases compeltion script >.>
<rtmf>	gh:rtmf/env
<rtmf>	note: install doesn't work yet
<zerkalerka>	hey guys what program is this when you open terminal it displays this info http://i.imgur.com/gf4e7sx.png

<switchy>	pandb, reptyr does something like that (but as rtmf said it's not the best solution)
<guest9308>	did anyone experienced crashes or system freeze with latest linux ck kernel which is the kernel 4? i am having this issue
<pandb>	i'll take a look at reptyr after tmux
<pandb>	anyone know of a convienient way to get the address of a dbus session from outside the login session it's running from?
<pandb>	right now im doing /proc/pid/environ and getting dbus_session_bus_address from there
<switchy>	pandb, yeah, it's really best to just use a multiplexer in the first place
<pandb>	im pretty unfamiliar with the concept of 'multiplexing'so i probably have some reading to do
<wildefyr>	ponyrider: yeah, i've tried canto but it doesn't work well for url selection
<grawity>	pandb: a) stash it somewhere on login, like `echo "$dbus_session_bus_address" > "$xdg_runtime_dir/dbus.env"` in your ~/.xprofile
<scimmia>	guest9308, check the forum thread
<grawity>	pandb: b) let the clients determine it based on $display (they'll look in ~/.dbus for that)
<grawity>	pandb: c) wait 1-3 years until everything moves to the 'user bus' model
<grawity>	pandb: d) convert your system to the 'user bus' model
<wildefyr>	d far too much effort
<pandb>	haha thanks grawity
<pandb>	i like a)
<pandb>	i don't quite understand b)
<grawity>	e) find a way to make your x session always start the bus at a fixed address, which is pretty much the same as d) but doesn't sound as hard
<junka>	guest9308; kernel 4 is on the testing repo iirc
<switchy>	junka, they're talking about linux-ck in [aur]
<junka>	switchy; i see
<abuss>	hi all, having some issues trying to update
<sdh_>	hi there. anyone knows why the display-manager service files (sddm, lightdm) need to have 'conflicts=getty@tty1.service'?
<abuss>	a bunch of programs called from .install keep crashing with general protection faults in libpthread
<abuss>	libc was recently upgraded but i upgraded linux too and then rebooted
<abuss>	few other programs segfault on exit - emacs, txtw
<sheep>	sdh_: because they need control of tty1
<grawity>	they want to start the first display (the login screen usually) on tty1, instead of the old model of just picking the first free tty (e.g. tty7)
<grawity>	mostly for convenience and consistency, afaik
<sdh_>	oh ok. but if i choose minimumvt=7, it still shuts down tty1
<sdh_>	i guess i can remove that line
<grawity>	follow the regular instructions of customizing systemd units
<dacoit>	systemctl edit
<grawity>	--full
<sdh_>	cool, thanks! sheep grawity dacoit :)
<dacoit>	oh, had no idea --full existed. cool
<dacoit>	i would've done something silly like conflicts= in a drop in. same end result i guess
<v3nturetheworld>	hey anyone use kodi? i'm getting a 404 error on libwbclient and smbclient from mirrors.kernal.org, which are dependencies for kodi
<grawity>	if pacman can't find packages, that means it's looking for *old* packages
<grawity>	which means it's time to -syu
<v3nturetheworld>	lol...im an idiot. normally i syu every day...
<jushur>	v3nturetheworld: and manualy resolving the dns works?
<dacoit>	you'll see that libwbclient was updated recently
<v3nturetheworld>	yeah, syu fixed the issue lol
<switchy>	also, kernel is spelled "kernel"
<dacoit>	lanix kernal
<v3nturetheworld>	lol
<jushur>	the fun part is it does resolv, and its a shell provider
<switchy>	...is it? i get some bible studies site
<jushur>	you know how thats possible right? :d

<tekken>	you guys talk a lot.
<tekken>	gonna fill up my poor disk with logs.
<nukke>	is there a way to use bitmap fonts with gtk?
<nukke>	i tried both the font name and the one generated by xfontsel in my .gtk2.0-rc config
<switchy>	you'd probably want to make sure fontconfig knows about the font (fc-list)
<nukke>	switchy: it does show up, yes.
<grawity>	make sure /etc/fonts/conf.d/70-no-bitmaps.conf is disabled
<grawity>	the regular font names should work then
<nukke>	grawity: yep, file doesn't exist so that's good. the thing is i'm already using that font with my terminal with no problems.
<grawity>	that's not the same thing
<nukke>	but when i put it on my .gtk config it changes the interfaces to some other font
<switchy>	nukke, what's the line you're adding to your .gtkrc?
<switchy>	well, .gtkrc-2.0 i think
<switchy>	(not .gtk2.0-rc)
<grawity>	honestly it works fine with both "fixed" and "terminus"
<kadosh>	hey
<grawity>	after temporarily removing the above symlink
<kadosh>	a question
<kadosh>	i'm using mutt-kz
<kadosh>	but suddenly some bindings stopped working,
<kadosh>	but only in my user
<kadosh>	xd
<kadosh>	i tested on others and they work
<kadosh>	it doesn't really make sense
<kadosh>	they are attach-file and quit
<kadosh>	i changed them on mutt configuration, but its not the keys, but the actual function
<kadosh>	has someone faced something like this? there is nothing on google  xd
<nukke>	ah okok, it works grawity and switchy. i had to set the font size to something really small.
<nukke>	thanks.
<naloth>	iam trying to add a line to my conky.config for gpu temp and cpu/load but i cant seem to figure out if it is the right values how do i check this ?

<naloth>	command not found :(

<tekken>	its just one package. -.-
<naloth>	this is not showing the temp and or the gpu load etc. :(
<jackwinter1>	g0ts1ck: how do you mean?
<g0ts1ck>	jackwinter1: that a "requires" from pkgbuild is a svn checkout ?
<grawity>	yes, and it's even documented in `man pkgbuild`

<wildefyr>	no, you'll have to find an alternative method, look into amd commandline ultities
<wildefyr>	sure there are some
<naloth>	wildefyr: well is hwmon 0 temp 1 always gpu ?
<sheep>	no
<wildefyr>	pretty sure no
<pandb>	is it generally ok to manually stash pertinent info in the directories in /var/run?

<g0ts1ck>	kk
<sheep>	g0ts1ck: rpm spec file?
<g0ts1ck>	yea
<grawity>	g0ts1ck: this is not redhat and we do not use rpm
<sheep>	ew god no why
<g0ts1ck>	cuz my company is moving to arch arhitecture, but till now we used fedora
<sheep>	there are ways to convert rpms to pacman packages, but they all require a pkgbuild
<g0ts1ck>	:)
<pandb>	i wrote a startup script that stores the session bus address for a gnome login session
<g0ts1ck>	yea i knoo sheep
<grawity>	pandb: use $xdg_runtime_dir for that
<pandb>	grawity: i did :)
<pandb>	$xdg_runtime_dir/gnome-shell/runtime-state-le.$display, to be exact
<grawity>	uh, why not just directly under $xdg_runtime_dir/ somewhere
<grawity>	why stash it deep inside an app's private directory
<grawity>	especially one that requires knowing $display
<pandb>	because the dbus session bus is specific to the gnome session
<grawity>	it's not specific to gnome in general
<pandb>	sure
<pandb>	but gnome creates one anew when a new session is started
<pandb>	there's one for each running session
<grawity>	yes, but the bus address is still not a property of gnome
<grawity>	almost the opposite
<pandb>	oh
<grawity>	it's just like the x11 display, just happens to be used by gnome, but still considered a general session resource
<pandb>	but the lifetime for that particular session bus is tied to the gnome session it was started in
<pandb>	as far as i can tell
<grawity>	which is why it's called a "session bus" and not "the gnome bus"
<pandb>	sure
<pandb>	but perhaps an entry in /tmp would be more prudent
<grawity>	not really
<grawity>	that's basically *exactly* what $xdg_runtime_dir is for
<pandb>	sure
<grawity>	just not $xdg_runtime_dir/gnome-shell
<pandb>	i see
<pandb>	pretty cool though, i have an easy way to specify a running session bus now
<grawity>	consider wayland – when you start gnome-shell as a wayland compositor, then the wayland-0 socket is not only tied to the gnome session, it's even *entirely* owned & managed by gnome-shell, but it still remains a shared session resource and so it remains $xdg_runtime_dir/wayland-0 regardless of it being gnome
<grawity>	pandb: anyway, on to my second point
<grawity>	pandb: your previously chosen location had $display in it
<pandb>	yah
<grawity>	pandb: which implies that you already know $display from somewhere, and just need to find the bus for it
<pandb>	ok
<grawity>	pandb: where do you get that $display from
<grawity>	like, do you actually have $display, or were you planning to hardcode :0 there
<grawity>	because if you actually have $display, then you're pretty much just duplicating what dbus already does by itself
<grawity>	if you have $display but lack the bus address, dbus already looks in ~/.dbus/session-bus/<machineid>-$display to find the bus address
<pandb>	huh
<pandb>	imma check that out...
<pandb>	there's no ~/.dbus here
<grawity>	hmm
<grawity>	oh, i think i know
<grawity>	gdm no longer uses dbus-launch, it starts dbus-daemon directly now
<pandb>	dbus-launch is still used
<pandb>	i see entries corresponding to the two terminals i've started gnome from
<pandb>	when i do ps aux
<grawity>	with startx, yes
<pandb>	yes
<nullie>	something wrong with my mouse, it grabs pointer and doesn't release it
<nullie>	ah, found solution
<guiburgueira>	oh god, 10h trying to fix the perfect grub
<tomty89>	fix how?
<tomty89>	removing grub-mkconfig?
<namarrgon>	removing grub!
<grawity>	removing gru—
<guiburgueira>	how can i fix a conflict of dual mbr. i got a mbr from a old windows partition
<tomty89>	that's the most urgent fix grub needs
<tomty89>	workaround rm /usr/bin/grub-mkconfig
<guiburgueira>	i tried to remove, put some arguments, install other packages
<tomty89>	huh conflicting mbr?
<estan>	hi. i tried to set systemmaxuse to 50m in journald.conf, but i get: [    2.491511] systemd-journald[150]: [/etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/elvis-journald.conf:2] failed to parse size value, ignoring: 50m
<namarrgon>	guiburgueira: slow down and exaplain "dual mbr"
<guiburgueira>	if i destroy the old mbr of windows drive would i lost everything in the drive?
<namarrgon>	you have two disks?
<grawity>	estan: ...i think that parameter takes percentages?
<guiburgueira>	yes
<pandb>	what's better when specifying a negative condition in a shell script, exclamation point inside the brackets, or outside?
<guiburgueira>	3 disks, 2 mbr i guess
<pandb>	[[ ! ... or ! [[ ... ?
<grawity>	estan: (don't bother with journald.conf.d)
<namarrgon>	guiburgueira: what is the problem?
<grawity>	pandb: either works, as long as it's consistent
<tomty89>	pandb: i usually see ! inside
<tomty89>	but meh
<grawity>	pandb: though `! [[ foo || bar || baz ]]` looks nicer than `[[ !(foo || bar || baz) ]]`
<estan>	grawity: hm. i'm pretty sure it's to be given as sizes and not percentages? i think the manual just discusses percentages at that point because the defaults are some percentage of the disk size?
<guiburgueira>	namarrgon, if i try to boot with all drives connected i got a error for a not found uuid
<estan>	grawity: alright, journald.conf.d was the recommended way when i put it there i think, what should i use now?
<namarrgon>	guiburgueira: is the boot-order set so you boot from the disk that you installed grub to?
<estan>	ah. i have a trailing # comment in the config, perhaps that's not allowed?
<guiburgueira>	nice question
<guiburgueira>	le me see
<namarrgon>	guiburgueira: uefi is not involved, right?
<grawity>	estan: for units it's the recommended way, yeah, but for global configs it's not really needed
<grawity>	it's fine to edit journald.conf directly
<guiburgueira>	my pc doesn't has uefi
<guiburgueira>	i used mbr instead gpt..
<guiburgueira>	that was another 2h...
<estan>	grawity: alright, i see. i thought one benefit was that i wouldn't have to merge in the .pacnew should the default config change.
<grawity>	well, yes, i guess
<guiburgueira>	namarrgon, my hd is in the 1s position as slave
<guiburgueira>	is it the problem?
<namarrgon>	no
<estan>	grawity: the trailing # comment i had was the culprit. i just assumed it was allowed.
<namarrgon>	guiburgueira: is it the first one on the boot-priority list?
<guiburgueira>	namarrgon, magically now the system boot normaly even with everything connected..
<guiburgueira>	namarrgon, yes it ever was
<guiburgueira>	faulty sata cable can do this?
<namarrgon>	sata doesn't have master/slave
<guiburgueira>	shitty mobo...
<guiburgueira>	i guess
<guiburgueira>	but now the problem is solved
<guiburgueira>	=d
<jackwinter1>	is there a way to stop user dbus started daemons from the root account?
<tekken>	my poor legs hur.
<tekken>	too much biking. :(
<mrelendig>	jackwinter1: sure, but why?
<mrelendig>	!xyproblem
<phrik>	tell us what you're really trying to do. http://mywiki.wooledge.org/xyproblem
<jackwinter1>	mrelendig: i have btsync running as a user service, and i'd like to stop it when nm brings up wifi or 3g

<nimpsnawak>	what is the pacman update manager ?
<namarrgon>	pacman?
<nimpsnawak>	namarrgon, yeah !! but more like a gtk gui or something
<jackwinter1>	mrelendig: heh, i realize that my initial question was incorrectly formulated, any ideas on how to do what i want to do?
<namarrgon>	nimpsnawak: i don't see one in the screenshot
<nimpsnawak>	there is a notification on the right of the arch menu logo
<tomty89>	dropbox?
<tomty89>	ah that pacman one
<nimpsnawak>	namarrgon, "4 updates"
<namarrgon>	nimpsnawak: echo "$(checkupdates| wc -l) update(s)"
<tomty89>	primitive
<tomty89>	don't make it run to frequent, it might hurt our mirrors :p
<nimpsnawak>	namarrgon, thx !
<nimpsnawak>	tomty89, well yes :)
<guiburgueira>	is rtorrent the best btorrent client? what ui do you use if so?
<tomty89>	deluge!
<shadowkatstudios>	transmission-qt
<tomty89>	ugh
<nimpsnawak>	transmission : seed limit, up/down limit, fully encrypted traffic, blocklist, simple gui :)
<nimpsnawak>	deluge is quite well too but i've some issue with upload limitation
<root____4>	hi tom^
<tomty89>	wat
<mrelendig>	jackwinter1: networkmanager have hooks
<mrelendig>	and sudo exists
<shadowkatstudios>	that moment when you realise you've made 4 times as many commits to your git repo as you thought
<shadowkatstudios>	feels like progess :d
<jackwinter1>	mrelendig: yes and i use them for some things.  so the solution is to hardcode the username and use sudo?
<mrelendig>	that is one way
<jackwinter1>	ok, thanks
<guiburgueira>	i was using qbitorrent on win. nobody tried it on linux?
<tomty89>	does it work in linux
<mrelendig>	no, not a single person in the whole workd
<mrelendig>	world*
<tomty89>	well wine still counts i guess
<mrelendig>	not one of the 8 billion people on this planet
<shadowkatstudios>	are we up to 8 billion now? :/
<tomty89>	not a dust in this freakin' universe
<tomty89>	not a shred of light in the multiverse
<guiburgueira>	tomty89, yes is a multplat
<tomty89>	hmm it's even free software

<tomty89>	but it's qt :(
<mrelendig>	sighty different number on some of the others
<mrelendig>	just use transmission
<saivert>	deluge is python. your point?
<tomty89>	saivert:
<tomty89>	no
<tomty89>	deluge is pygtk
<tomty89>	:)
<tekken>	it's still python.
<saivert>	lol
<saivert>	toolkit wars!
<tomty89>	tekken: but that's not my issue
<tomty89>	saivert: yeah that is
<tekken>	do people actually like qt?
<tomty89>	i wonder why libtorrent-rasterbar is still stuck at 0.16 in arch
<tomty89>	tekken: some
<tekken>	i mean.... i do since gtk3, but still.
<tomty89>	tekken: even linus does i think
<shadowkatstudios>	qt behaves better than gtk3 for me
<tekken>	i'm gonna make a bunch of a fltk apps.
<tekken>	that sounds nice.
<shadowkatstudios>	i use transmission-qt because it actually listens to my dark gtk2 theme
<tomty89>	pygobject \o/
<saivert>	gobject-introspection <3
<tomty89>	gnome \o/
<saivert>	deluge is still using the static bindings though
<tekken>	i like deluge.
<tekken>	so i'm out of this one.
<saivert>	not enough people bothers with that. poorly maintained
<tomty89>	i'm gonna see if i can use deluge with libtorrent-rasterbar 1.0.4
<saivert>	autoadd plugin still doesn't have webui ui code so can only configure it using the gtk frontend
<saivert>	they managed to write code for the webui but not actually let it use the gtk ui stuff. missed opportunity. gtk can easily render as a web page
<saivert>	so now they have to write every ui shit twice. once for the web ui and once for the gtk ui
<saivert>	oh the pain
<tomty89>	port it
<tomty89>	to gtk3 as well
<tomty89>	!give saivert g github
<phrik>	saivert: github · build software better, together.: <https://github.com/>
<tekken>	saivert: i wanna see an fltk port of deluge.
<tekken>	it'd be fast.
<tekken>	:)
<tomty89>	ah /s/port/fork
<saivert>	and light
<saivert>	pork
<tomty89>	good one
<shadowkatstudios>	bacon
<tekken>	i should learn to use fltk better.
<saivert>	hey my phone's codename is bacon actually
<tekken>	it makes lightning speed stuff.
<saivert>	guess which one it is
<tekken>	getting it not ugly is an issue, however.
<tomty89>	clitk
<tekken>	whoever came up with the mozilla build system needs to be shot.
<tekken>	its clumsy as shit
<guiburgueira>	i was thinking of running rtorrent and rutorrent but dunno if it worth the resources to run a web server..

<tomty89>	tingping: great
<danners>	hey i have a weird issue: when i am copying stuff to an usb stick the performance if the whole system gets terribly sluggish. htop says the load is over 5 but doesnt show any bus process. how could i find out where the problem is?
<estan>	anyone seen this after a recent-ish upgrade? https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1524213#p1524213
<phrik>	title: systemd device dev-disk-by\{stuff} appeared twice with sysfs diff path / system administration / arch linux forums (at bbs.archlinux.org)
<mrelendig>	danners: welcome to crappy hardware
<mrelendig>	danners: check dmesg btw
<mrelendig>	is this a rpi btw?
<estan>	i'm suspecting that i have two partitions named "linux partition" is the culprit, but i don't quite see why that should be a problem?
<danners>	no t420 dmesg is clear
<guiburgueira>	which one should i choose? cinnamon or xfce?
<mrelendig>	guiburgueira: neither, both sucks
<danners>	even if the stick is shit that shouldnt affect the rest of the system
<mrelendig>	gnome3, mate and kde are the only *good* de's
<mrelendig>	danners: except it does due to interupts etc
<danners>	 is there a way to monitor the interrupt rate?
<danners>	it only gets slow after a few minutes. itseems to fill up some buffers with 70mb/sec and then it goes to 5mb/sec and the whole system gets sluggish
<e^0>	what is the loop device displayed in the file manager ? i can't access it though
<smirky>	did someone see the linux-4.0.0->4.0.1 changelog? wtf... https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/changelog-4.0.1
<smirky>	more than two weeks and so few things changed
<smirky>	this has to be the smallest changelog ever
<mrelendig>	nop
<smirky>	it's as if the kernel is near perfection :d
<wildefyr>	smirky: there's no such thing
<smirky>	i was being ironic
<wildefyr>	:)
<e^0>	any idea of why a loop device is being displayed ? and how can i remove ti ?
<th0rne>	anyone have a sane ffmpeg template string to convert something to mp3?
<e^0>	damn kde pasma is still very much buggy
<nkparadox>	e^0,  did you mount any iso with -loop flag? it might be this
<e^0>	nkparadox: i have never mounted an iso
<e^0>	nkparadox: i did hide loop device and it got disappeared
<nkparadox>	e^0, so you got it solved
<e^0>	yeah :)
<e^0>	nkparadox: also any idea that, i am using awesomewm + kde, when i am attaching an external drive in kde it ask me for password tahn i am able to access it, but in awesome it directly says you don't have enough rights to access it. how to access the drive on awesomewm as well ?
<nkparadox>	e^0,  you using dolphin?
<e^0>	nkparadox: yes using dolphin
<nkparadox>	e^0, i am not sure exactly but doesnt kde using udisks or something like that? why does it ask for passwords?
<e^0>	nkparadox: it's default install i have not changed any settings yet, don't know why it ask's for passwd
<nkparadox>	e^0, what format has the external drive?
<e^0>	ntfs
<e^0>	i have installed ntfs-3g something similar pacakge
<nkparadox>	e^0, can you check if you got udisks installed?
<estan>	hm. i've followed https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/disable_clearing_of_boot_messages and i'm booting with the fbcon=scrollback:512k kernel param, but i still can't shift+pgup on tty1 (not even once). what could i be missing?
<phrik>	title: disable clearing of boot messages - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<e^0>	nkparadox: ok let me chk :)
<estan>	i can see the last of the messages from the bootup process ("[  ok  ] ..." et.c.), but i can't scroll up through them.
<nkparadox>	estan, why you want to scroll back?
<nkparadox>	estan, to see if something failed you could run systemctl --failed
<nkparadox>	estan, and check journalctl -b for last boot
<linduxed>	hmmm
<linduxed>	weird
<estan>	nkparadox: i know, but i think i saw some error or warning swoosh past during very early boot, and i can't find it in neither of them.
<nkparadox>	estan, and you see it in every boot?
<estan>	yes.
<linduxed>	whenever i start a roxterm terminal, i get a message in my "journalctl -f" window that "systemd-coredump[27835]: process 27834 (roxterm) of user 1000 dumped core."
<linduxed>	like... every time i start it
<linduxed>	weird
<estan>	could the problem be because of kms modesetting as described in https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/boot_debugging#cut_off_when_switching_resolution ? if so, is there really no way to have kms modesetting enabled and still be able to scroll back through boot messages?
<phrik>	title: boot debugging - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<nkparadox>	estan, are you sure its a system problem and not a hardware problem?
<linduxed>	xterm doesn't seem to do that though
<nkparadox>	estan, maybe looking through dmesg so something hardware related!
<estan>	nkparadox: hardware problem? as in a botched pgup or so?
<estan>	i've already looked through dmesg / journalctl -b.
<nkparadox>	estan, systemctl --failed?
<nkparadox>	estan, systemctl --failed?
<estan>	it's not about a failed systemd unit / service. it's much earlier than that.
<estan>	i see the message _very_ quickly during boot, too quick to see what it was about.
<estan>	besides, i like being able to scroll back through the boot messages on tty1, so i'd like to enable that anyway.
<tekken>	estan: then it would be in journalctl -b 0
<tekken>	o-o
<e^0>	yeah i have that installed
<nkparadox>	estan, was it saying clearly error or was it just a warning>
<estan>	nkparadox: i can't quite remember right now how it starts out. i'll do some reboots to try and pick it up. who knows it might have gone away. though i've had it for quite a while, so long that i've gotten used to it.
<estan>	it's just that it scrolls past so quickly, i've never really bothered to check out what it really was.
<tekken>	i just assume any error that doesn't directly affect my operations isn't an error to me.
<estan>	but today i thought i'd go through everything in my boot logs to see if there's something i should fix.
<e^0>	nkparadox: do i have to edit udisk file ?
<nkparadox>	tekken, thats dangerous because it might be a warning about some harddrive whos about to die
<estan>	yea, i might be a little ocd today. most of the time i think like you tekken :)
<nkparadox>	e^0, have you restarted after installing ntfs-3g?
<e^0>	yeah
<tekken>	nkparadox: i live for danger.
<tekken>	ha ha.... haaaa
<estan>	nkparadox: i'd think i definitely should be getting something like that in dmesg / journalctl -b though. i'm pretty sure this is just some silly harmless warning, but i'd like to know even so.
<tekken>	if i wanna know that badly
<saivert>	what is eating tekken
<nkparadox>	e^0, try reading this ! https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/polkit#udisks
<phrik>	title: polkit - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<e^0>	nkparadox: ok :)
<tekken>	this is about the time i start using mad amounts of grep to find something that looks like what i want
<tekken>	:x
<saivert>	grep |grep |grep| fuck it.
<tekken>	basically.
<estan>	so, back to my question: nevermind my errors/warnings, i would like to be able to shift+pgup on tty1, and i've tried the wiki instructions. anyone else had this problem?
<saivert>	inb4 all that can be replaced with this one line of sed
<saivert>	inb4 no awk is much better for this
<saivert>	then the fight is on
<estan>	also, if kms modesetting is the problem, must i really disable that if i want to be able to scroll? no workaround where i could keep it enabled?
<solipsists>	good morning :) i am pretty new to arch (2 weeks+) and got a problem with my digital audio (toslink with intel hda) output, i cant change volume, just same level or mute... (arch with kde plasma 5) i went through wiki already, but nothing is really related, sometimes i can change volume, sometimes not... any ideas?
<rkreis>	solipsists, are you using pulseaudio?
<rkreis>	either way, my guess is that you sometimes (watching a movie) end up in passthrough mode, and then there's no way to change the volume
<solipsists>	rkreis yes
<rkreis>	whatever is connected to the other end might tell you if there's pcm or ac3/dts on the link, is that the issue?
<solipsists>	rkreis i connected a 2.1 active soundsystem (edifier s530d) to the other end, the strange thing is, that it works sometimes and sometimes not...
<tekken>	woo
<tekken>	downloaded latest source of midori and compiled that baby.
<tekken>	smokin.
<rkreis>	solipsists, can you figure out if it's related to the link being in passthrough or pcm mode?
<saivert>	midori is super optimized isn't it because of the work by raspberry pi foundation
<saivert>	but only for armv6/v7 though
<rkreis>	i bet some optimizations also benifit other architectures
<saivert>	they unlocked a lot of optimizations in the code. used fastpaths for a lot of stuff that wasn't turned on by default.
<rkreis>	(i don't know anything about any optimizations anyone did to any browser)
<solipsists>	rkreis how do it do that? sorry, i am really new to this, my first time with pulseaudio :/
<rkreis>	solipsists, i never used spdif with pulse... i'd try opening pavucontrol and checking the "configuration" tab
<rkreis>	and making sure you don't use passthrough mode (it only really makes sense for more than 2 channels)

<guiburgueira>	how can remove gnome and all its dependencies? whats the commands?

<rkreis>	solipsists, analog stereo? i'd assume it doesn't work then?
<solipsists>	rkreis the strange thing is - it works! i listen to music atm... :d
<rkreis>	over toslink? remarkable :)
<rkreis>	what about the "configuration" tab?

<rkreis>	solipsists, i'd try changing the profile to, uh, i don't remember
<rkreis>	some 2 channel spdif magical digital
<tomty89>	hmm gnome-tweak-tool is a part of gnome-extra now
<tomty89>	rkreis: iec blah blah blah
<rkreis>	thank you :)
<solipsists>	rkreis - http://imgur.com/oz2uk9q - chooose wisely :d

<rkreis>	just what tomty89 said
<tomty89>	it
<tomty89>	's shown as plugged :o
<rkreis>	haha, it can't really know if it's plugged in or not, can it? as far as i remember, it's a simplex link
<tomty89>	or rather no (unplugged)
<estan>	i now tried enabling kms in early boot (through modules in mkinitcpio.conf), but i still can't scroll on tty1 :/
<tomty89>	wat
<solipsists>	tomty89 rkreis no sound at all at iec958
<tomty89>	disable getty@tty1
<rkreis>	hum, i'm running out of suggestions
<tomty89>	solipsists: it's myterious that you said you are using digital while it shows analog for spotify
<solipsists>	rkreis tomty89 i dont know why the toslink is mapped to analog output... thats weird
<tomty89>	solipsists: what's the problem btw
<estan>	tomty89: "disable getty@tty1" <- hm, was that for me?
<tomty89>	estan: yes if you wanna scroll at tty1
<tomty89>	or have things to scroll
<solipsists>	rkreis thanks so far!
<solipsists>	tomty89 i cant change volume, sometimes it works most of the times not
<estan>	tomty89: you mean https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/disable_clearing_of_boot_messages ? i have done that, and also https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/scrollback_buffer
<phrik>	title: disable clearing of boot messages - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<tomty89>	estan: yeah
<estan>	tomty89: and i've enabled early boot kms (if kms is enabled late, i read that it will wipe the buffer).
<tomty89>	solipsists: hmm for digital output the volume should be either done by pulse or the software
<estan>	here's someone with the same problem (and also intel graphics like me): https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=168036 , but he solved it by disabling kms altogether. i'd rather try to have it enabled, and i would think that enabling it at early boot should work.
<smirky>	can i increase the tty count with enable getty@ttyx ?
<phrik>	title: [solved] stop first 20 boot messages clearing / newbie corner / arch linux forums (at bbs.archlinux.org)
<estan>	oh well. i give up for now. thanks for the tips folks.
<solipsists>	tomty89 i cant change volume, either in volumemanager nor in the application itself
<tomty89>	solipsists: no idea. need more information from pacmd when it does not work
<solipsists>	tomty89 so think i have to open a thread in forum...
<tomty89>	maybe finding out why the wrong "mapping" helps
<solipsists>	tomty any ideas what to do in pacmd?
<tomty89>	probably check list sinks / cards / clients
<tomty89>	see how is everything collaborating
<tomty89>	solipsists: how do you start pulseaudio?
<solipsists>	tomty89 what do you mean? how do i find out? sorry - for my noobynish ;)
<tomty89>	what de/wm are you on?
<solipsists>	tomty89 kde plasma5
<tomty89>	hmm it probably make use of /etc/xdg/autostart/pulseaudio.desktop then
<solipsists>	1sec let me check
<tomty89>	if you can find pulse with `pgrep -a pulse` right after login
<tomty89>	(assuming you use a dm though)
<solipsists>	u where right its in xdg
<tomty89>	solipsists: no the files comes with pulseaudio
<tomty89>	solipsists: it's about whether something will make use of it
<tomty89>	solipsists: what i was suspecting is nothing start pulse at login at it's just started by some software on demand (like firefox or mpv)
<solipsists>	ah i see
<tomty89>	so when you use software that doesn't start it before you start those, it use plain alsa
<tomty89>	then volume thing might not work, unless the software do software volume
<tomty89>	solipsists: you can probably see that there's no slider of digital output in alsamixer, but only mute/unmute
<tomty89>	solipsists: but in that case you probably won't see the software listed in pavucontrol though...
<tomty89>	or not even see anything in it
<solipsists>	k
<solipsists>	give me one sec i will try
<solipsists>	tomty89 it is started before i start any apps
<tekken>	ick
<tekken>	i was in the shower almost an hour.
<tekken>	too long.
<tomty89>	solipsists: okay

<throstur>	everything is jittery right now and i'm not sure why. when i move my mouse in circles i see the cursor at 4 or 5 different points in the circle, it's not smooth. already tried rebooting, what should i do to troubleshoot?
<throstur>	it's not persistent, but happens and stops
<tomty89>	what gfx
<throstur>	nvidia?
<throstur>	you mean which driver or?
<tomty89>	card and driver
<throstur>	nvidia geforce gt 540m, how do i figure out which driver i'm currently using again?
<throstur>	i think i'm using nouveau
<tomty89>	pacman -qs nvidia
<junka>	having it installed does not mean he uses it too
<junka>	imho
<nyuszika7h>	nouveau is in the kernel, so it's always installed
<junka>	i was talking about the closed drivers
<tomty89>	having nvidia module installed normally means nouveau is blacklisted
<tomty89>	also i want to check his libgl as well
<grawity>	nyuszika7h: not entirely; it does also need mesa (as opposed to nvidia-libgl) and whatever's left of the xorg driver
<throstur>	i'm also having some wifi problems :/ but anywa i'm pretty sure i'm using nouveau, at least that's the only driver i'm finding in /var/log/xong.0.log
<tomty89>	grats, you've hit the two blackhole in linux
<mar77i>	eww
<mar77i>	i'm blind. can anyone tell me what's going on?
<throstur>	tomty89: graphics and networking?
<throstur>	tomty89: or linux and broadcom? i also have an alfa awus036h but it's also dropping sometimes
<mar77i>	not funny
<throstur>	s/linux/nvidia/
<tomty89>	gfx and wifi
<th0rne>	what's a good cli currency converter program/script in pacman/aur?
<tomty89>	hmm

<tekken>	i like a nice atheros wireless chipset.
<tekken>	those are always nice.
<tomty89>	atheros is the angel
<tekken>	tomty89: everything on the atheros chips work.... and it works really really well.
<wildefyr>	th0rne: units
<wildefyr>	in the repos i think
<mar77i>	th0rne: you're looking for "units"
<wildefyr>	wtf
<wildefyr>	i literally just said that
<mar77i>	yeah i'm blind, remember?
<tomty89>	copycat
<mar77i>	but units likely doesn't do currencies in an updated manner
<wildefyr>	apparently
<tomty89>	which is pointless then
<mar77i>	i think this will get you off the ground http://www.linux-magazine.com/online/blogs/productivity-sauce/simple-bash-currency-converter

<tomty89>	hmm that's cool
<mar77i>	my google skill is cool? i knew it!
<tomty89>	no
<th0rne>	lol this units. is there a way to update the exchange rates?
<tomty89>	the bash skill of that geek
<tomty89>	or rather the google fu and sed skill
<th0rne>	it gives 73 euro cents to a us dollar, when it's actually 91 euro cents.
<mar77i>	!qsay 21145
<phrik>	mar77i: <mar77i> do i look like a fucking google!?
<tomty89>	the bash skill is only positional parameters
<th0rne>	that's more harmful than useful.
<tomty89>	th0rne: you mean "units"?
<th0rne>	yes?
<tomty89>	fortunately
<mar77i>	th0rne: unis doesn't update the exchange rates, however you could hook up the units file to the google script i just posted if you read along carefully with us
<mar77i>	*units
<tomty89>	fsf sometimes does host garbage
<tomty89>	or mix something alright/good with garbage
<tomty89>	like having currency in this "units"
<tomty89>	and grub-mkconfig in grub
<th0rne>	ah, sorry, you didn't highlight so i notice. :)
<th0rne>	*didn't notice
<tomty89>	highlight is evil
<th0rne>	i like it.
<tomty89>	it's rude. it means "i only talk to you about this but nobody else"
<th0rne>	lol
<th0rne>	i think you're confusing it with /msg
<tomty89>	th0rne: nope
<mar77i>	/msg th0rne nope
<tomty89>	with /msg others doesn't know you're rude
<tomty89>	but with highlight you're apparently rude

<phrik>	good morning to all from tomty89!
<smirky>	what can you do with pid files except send sigkill, sigterm, etc to the proccess?

<phrik>	th0rne: good morning to all from tomty89!
<smirky>	are there any other meanings to it
<tomty89>	this is super rude
<grawity>	smirky: that's pretty much the whole point of pid files
<grawity>	smirky: they tell you a daemon's pid
<grawity>	smirky: for the purpose of killing it
<th0rne>	^^
<smirky>	grawity: ok, thanks for clarifying
<woffs>	smirky: cat /proc/$pid/task/*/stack :-)

<woffs>	strace -fp $pid
<tomty89>	!define
<grawity>	ih, what kind of problems
<sbrg>	i just did a system-wide update on a friend's laptop and it resulted in everything going black, and upon reboot, it would not launch gdm properly. i downgraded the kernel to 3.19.3(plus headers) as well as gdm and libgdm, and now it seems to satrt but only shows a black scree

<phrik>	title: proc(5) - linux manual page (at man7.org)
<sbrg>	looking through journalctl for gdm doesn't show anything out of order as such
<tomty89>	sbrg: catalyst?
<sbrg>	no, nvidia with nouveaou or however yo uspell it
<mar77i>	sbrg: also look at /var/log/xorg.0.log and maybe /var/log/gdm.log, if those don't report to the journal
<tomty89>	!g french new
<phrik>	tomty89: latest news reports on france, french politics and culture ...: <http://www.france24.com/en/france/>
<sbrg>	those report to the journal
<tomty89>	sbrg: paste journal?
<tomty89>	not limited to gdm
<mar77i>	well if you know it that precisely, you must be seeing what's wrong already and might have solved the problem without us. great.
<sbrg>	is journal since boot fine?
<dagle>	isn't catalyst 3 things now in the "linux world"?
<tomty89>	what three things
<dagle>	i remember when catalyst was a perl framework...
<tomty89>	sbrg: sure
<tomty89>	ah the django alternative :p
<mar77i>	sbrg: bluntly, i don't believe you about x11 though.
<tomty89>	dagle: what's the third
<abdu1989>	 is there a similar program in archlinux  remastersys & relinux & systembac
<tomty89>	wow what are those
<sbrg>	mar77i: journalctl includes x11 log output, including "log file: /dev/null" + there are no xorg.*.log files in /var/log
<tomty89>	gdm put xorg logs to journal
<sbrg>	(which is strange, seeing as they are there on my system also running arch)
<sbrg>	aah
<sbrg>	anyway, log file coming.. just need a working commandline paste utility

<tomty89>	"i don't fxxking care what gdm does"
<mar77i>	grawity: will do.

<tomty89>	first time i see it on pastebin.com
<sbrg>	no idea why
<g0ts1ck>	grawity: do you own a repository ?
<g0ts1ck>	i'm interested in managment of repo
<tomty89>	sbrg: eh apr 29 12:52:02 zacklimp gdm-xorg-:0[358]: (ww) warning, couldn't open module nouveau
<sbrg>	yeah, i saw that
<grawity>	g0ts1ck: and why are you nagging me about it
<grawity>	tomty89: it did load modesetting
<sbrg>	but that seems strange since i can "startx" fine(which starts awesome wm)
<g0ts1ck>	looking for advice grawity
<dagle>	g0ts1ck: start with managing a private repository, then make it live and then maybe you will be included?
<tomty89>	sbrg: hmm
<grawity>	g0ts1ck: so search the wiki about creating repositories
<dagle>	public*
<grawity>	g0ts1ck: or ask the channel about creating repositories
<mar77i>	sbrg: did you say you're running nouveau on the box from which you pasted the log?
<g0ts1ck>	dagle: allready have that, but havent meet this situation, handeling over 20 db's on one repo
<sbrg>	what about: apr 29 12:52:02 zacklimp gdm-xorg-:0[358]: (ee) systemd-logind: failed to get session: pid 358 does not belong to any known session ?
<abdu1989>	how-to] using archlinux iso?

<sbrg>	yes.
<tomty89>	or what ever burns
<mar77i>	!give abdu1989 guide
<phrik>	abdu1989: http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/beginners_guide
<tomty89>	sbrg: do you have xf86-video-nouveau?
<mar77i>	sbrg: we can assume there's no session when gdm starts, because a session would then be started from there.
<mar77i>	sbrg: i did think we were researching about a black display though.
<sbrg>	tomty89: doesn't look like it, no. this is all very strange.
<mar77i>	sbrg: how did you figure out you were using nouveau if the package wasn't installed?
<sbrg>	because the driver is loaded
<mar77i>	...
<sbrg>	lsmod | grep -i nouveau  etc
<tomty89>	modesetting.so is loaded
<tomty89>	!g xorg ddx
<phrik>	tomty89: glossary - x.org: <http://www.x.org/wiki/development/documentation/glossary/>
<tomty89>	x driver
<e^0>	i am using 3 hdd's is it possible that if i am not using it i can give rest to the disk so as it's life increases :d
<e^0>	i have connected all 3 of them
<mar77i>	sbrg: your nouveau driver appears to be installed in a nonstandard way. can you figure out if pacman was used to install it?
<tomty89>	you mean by disconnecting it?
<tomty89>	e^0: ^
<e^0>	tomty89: no they are connected 24x7.
<mar77i>	e^0: if you don't mount it, there shoul be hardly any i/o on a disk.
<tomty89>	e^0: so what do you mean by not using it then
<tomty89>	it will still spin though
<sbrg>	mar77i: i'm taking a look at it, yes
<e^0>	mar77i: tomty89 ok that's what i wanted to know. even i don't mount it, will it still spin ?
<tomty89>	slowly, but yes afaik
<tomty89>	or relatively slowly
<e^0>	their must be a way to stop them and only start spinning when i want
<tomty89>	but it might not hurt for them to spin from time to time :p
<tomty89>	24x7 is another thing though
<e^0>	tomty89: the thing is the disk are getting old, so till i get the replacement i want to keep them alive :d
<tomty89>	hdparm might have an option to slow it down on some drives
<tomty89>	e^0: better just unplug it?
<tomty89>	because the heat might hurt anyway :p
<tomty89>	if you're that paranoid
<sbrg>	tomty89: what does that mean exactly? the ddx thing
<e^0>	tomty89: ok will unplug it than :)
<mar77i>	well that would also mean you'd take it out of the case, away from said heat.
<tomty89>	sbrg: what you see in lsmod is the kernel module/driver
<sbrg>	at any rate, i have pacman logs back to when i installed the system, and the only reference i can find to installing xf86-video-nouveau is when i just installed it two minutes ago
<sbrg>	tomty89: yep, i know that much
<tomty89>	sbrg: but xorg needs another module/driver
<sbrg>	aah
<e^0>	tomty89: also one more thing, while mounting disk partitions in awesome wm it fails and says " an unspecified error has occured: not authorised to perform operation but in kde a dialouge appears for password and then i can mount without any problems
<tomty89>	sbrg: you can pacman -qs
<e^0>	i am using kde + awesome wm
<sbrg>	alright - i understand. but what i don't understand is what broke gdm all of a sudden. as i said, everything worked fine before updating. perhaps there is another package i need to downgrade?
<tomty89>	that might be another question though
<tomty89>	e^0: polkit agent i guess
<e^0>	tomty89: i tried modifying udisk2 file too but no use
<mar77i>	sbrg: is it working yet or failing at the same spot?

<phrik>	title: polkit - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<sbrg>	mar77i: it still only shows a black screen upon login
<tomty89>	e^0: have .xinitrc start it like /usr/share/autostart/polkit-kde-authentication-agent-1.desktop may do the job
<e^0>	tomty89: that location is a real one or just an exmaple ?
<tomty89>	e^0: real one, if you have polkit-kde installed
<e^0>	tomty89: can you recommend a nice file manager ?
<tomty89>	e^0: i am just not sure if it supplies some param to the agent: /usr/lib/kde4/libexec/polkit-kde-authentication-agent-1
<e^0>	tomty89: for me it's etc/xdg/autostart/polkit-kde-authentication-agent-1.desktop
<tomty89>	e^0: probably a symlink by another package
<tomty89>	e^0: pacman -qo /etc/xdg/autostart/polkit-kde-authentication-agent-1.desktop
<tomty89>	e^0 kind of like the logic of systemctl enable i think
<e^0>	tomty89: polkit-kde-framework
<e^0>	tomty89: may be i am using awesome wm, that might be the reason it might not be working i guess.
<e^0>	wait i got an idea :) in kde there are autostart script, in that there was somethign similar to this, let me place that script in .xinitrc and then chk
<tomty89>	e^0: i don't know what exactly deals with those .desktop file but basically only "de" deals with it
<tomty89>	hmm apr 29 12:52:06 zacklimp gdm[353]: failed to give slave programs access to the display. trying to proceed.
<sbrg>	tomty89: any idea what that means?
<tomty89>	not sure. maybe a partial update due to broken mirror?
<tomty89>	sbrg: so you can gnome with startx?
<sbrg>	nope -- i run awesomewm
<sbrg>	trying to run gnome-session doesn't seem to work either
<tomty89>	sbrg: maybe do that and paste the xorg log again
<tomty89>	sbrg: just get xf86-video-nouveau and mesa-libgl this time
<tomty89>	made sure with pacman -qs instead of the pacman log :p
<tomty89>	there will be some sort of entry even if you didn't actually installed it

<tomty89>	does it work
<sbrg>	gdm doesn't start, gnome-session doesn't work, but i can startx and start awesomewm
<sbrg>	which i can see puts a lot of stuff in the logs as well

<tomty89>	sbrg: i can try look at the xorg log if you can try start gnome with startx again
<sbrg>	line 2298 is where i do systemctl stop gdm and then try running gnome-session, after which i run startx which starts awesomewm and paste the logs
<sbrg>	so modify xinitrc to use gnome-session?
<tomty89>	yup
<sbrg>	kk

<tomty89>	nvidia didn't even list the model of your card
<tomty89>	sbrg: btw is it a laptop?
<sbrg>	this is from disabling automatic gdm startup with systemctl, rebooting and then just running "startx" with xinitrc containing "exec gnome-session"
<sbrg>	yes, it is
<sbrg>	thinkpad edge something or the other
<sbrg>	e530
<tomty89>	hmm optimus?
<sbrg>	nope, don't think so
<sbrg>	oh, the graphics card?
<tomty89>	yeah, check lspci
<sbrg>	geforce gt 635m it says
<tomty89>	the only vga entry?
<sbrg>	hm, no, doesn't seem like it
<tomty89>	because it tries to load intel module
<sbrg>	seems to be an intel integrated one as well
<sbrg>	for which it loads i915
<tomty89>	probably an optimus thing then, which i'm not familiar with
<guiburgueira>	i'm installing gnome and it asks for a libx264, but i have 2 options one is 10bits and the other is default
<guiburgueira>	what i should do?
<tomty89>	guiburgueira: just the default, until you know and want 10bit encoding with x264
<tomty89>	sbrg: you should probably need to get xf86-video-intel anyway, and then either nouveau or bumblebee

<chrisliebaer>	are there any known issues with the new wpa_supplicant 2.4? i'm having problems connecting to a wpa enterprise network
<namarrgon>	chrisliebaer: yes, look at the bugtracker
<chrisliebaer>	which bugtracker?
<furah>	hey guys, i've got a big issue with wifi. i've managed to connect to a network using netctl, and i've been assigned a legitimate ip. however, i cannot ping anything besides my own ip address and 127.0.0.1, and i can't access the internet at all. the arch wiki and google have not been helpful so far.
<namarrgon>	!give chrisliebaer bugs
<phrik>	chrisliebaer: bugs?! arch linux has no bugs! oh.. wait.. https://bugs.archlinux.org
<tomty89>	furah: not even 8.8.8.8?
<furah>	not even 8.8.8.8.
<chrisliebaer>	namarrgon: perfect, thanks

<furah>	nor any ip on the network besides my own.
<furah>	i don't have access to a wired connection.
<bretzel>	is the may iso spin will comes with kernel 4 and all things built with gcc 5 ? :-)
<namarrgon>	very unlikely
<bretzel>	june then ?
<furah>	i should mention that i can ping the computer from the network via my phone.
<namarrgon>	bretzel: nobody knows, there is no fixed schedule
<saivert>	when you pinged from your phone. is that when you relized you are walking around with a computer in your pants?
<saivert>	welcome to the future!
<namarrgon>	bretzel: linux 4.0.x, probably. gcc 5, maybe.
<pvinis>	hello. is there a way to colorize  all output from the terminal? like a library or something?
<pvinis>	so that if i do ls, it knows and executes ls with colors
<furah>	i hate my phone. if it had a physical keyboard and ran archlinux arm i'd be happy.
<pvinis>	or if i do docker ps, it draws the columns with different colors
<saivert>	wouldn't that throw off some alarms?
<pvinis>	something like that
<demonicmaniac3>	furah: droid 4
<pessimist>	pvinis: alias ls='ls --color'
<demonicmaniac3>	furah: or jolla + the cover
<pvinis>	yes i know how to do it for ls
<pvinis>	im asking if there is a colorizer for everything
<pessimist>	no
<ack006>	optimist> yes
<pvinis>	i found this, http://korpus.juls.savba.sk/~garabik/software/grc.html and it says "yet another colouriser"
<phrik>	title: generic colouriser (at korpus.juls.savba.sk)
<pessimist>	unless you are talking about terminal colors. applications are free to use whatever colors (which are defined by your term) or don't use any at all
<furah>	i digress, even if i had a computer in my pockets running archlinux arm, and with a physical keyboard, it still would leave me without an actual computer.
<pvinis>	but i cant find any other ones..
<pvinis>	yes, thats what i mean
<ack006>	furah: isn't that a contradiction?
<pessimist>	terminal colors = colors defined by the terminal
<furah>	ack006: it's not a desktop.
<ack006>	furah: ah, ok
<throstur>	furah: a computer is not a desktop, although desktops are a subset of computers
<pvinis>	i think we dont understand each other..
<pvinis>	heres an example
<furah>	still, don't make me go to bed crying because i can't get internet on my desktop.
<ack006>	furah: ask google to float one of them blimps over your house, drop a usb wifi stick on your lawn :-)
<pvinis>	i type ls -a, it should call ls -a --color, or just colorize in some way similar to ls
<throstur>	alias ls = ls--color=auto
<furah>	ack006: that wouldn't solve anything bar making extremely convenient to throw it.
<throstur>	s/--/ --/
<ack006>	lol
<saivert>	this colorizes dig : http://hastebin.com/inogujecew.bash
<phrik>	title: hastebin (at hastebin.com)
<pvinis>	ok but i want it to work with everything
<saivert>	an example that can be used on anything
<pvinis>	any command
<saivert>	just adapt  it
<saivert>	you need to code rules for it. or should it just rainbow everything randomly?
<pvinis>	with rules
<g0ts1ck>	can you password protect downloading package, password required for pacman -s package ?
<pvinis>	thats what im asking. is there a library/plugin/addon/script that would do that?
<throstur>	g0ts1ck: you have to be a sudoer to pacman -s, isn't that enough?
<grawity>	g0ts1ck: not really, though you can try setting up regular http basic authentication
<g0ts1ck>	no  :)
<pvinis>	again, i found this http://korpus.juls.savba.sk/~garabik/software/grc.html and it says yet another colorizer, but i cant seem to find any others
<phrik>	title: generic colouriser (at korpus.juls.savba.sk)
<g0ts1ck>	hmm, check i have a repo that is common.db
<g0ts1ck>	and wanna allow few people downloading package that isnt allowed to all
<throstur>	g0ts1ck: you can write a pacman wrapper that parses the argument and checks if it is in some_file and if so then it exits, otherwise it installs normally
<throstur>	but the wrapper must then be suid root
<throstur>	(so make sure it's not easily exploitable)
<g0ts1ck>	i cant enable http auto, becouse it will disable other users from using the repo
<g0ts1ck>	throstur: cant use wrapper
<grawity>	well you're asking for two opposite things then
<g0ts1ck>	no i'm not, imagine it like this
<throstur>	g0ts1ck: why not?
<grawity>	if you want a password for user a, but no password for all other users
<grawity>	then what's stopping user a from pretending they're user b?
<g0ts1ck>	on a certain package
<g0ts1ck>	not all
<grawity>	then enable http auth for that specific package's file
<g0ts1ck>	you can do that ? :d
<g0ts1ck>	grawity: mind giving some refference ?
<bellbreaker>	the font size in my terminals just changed after rebooting. fonts in skype have also changed size, but fonts in firefox are the same as before the reboot. what can cause this?
<namarrgon>	which packages were updated?
<grawity>	g0ts1ck: mind googling for it yourself?
<bellbreaker>	i installed bumblebee, but removed it again
<g0ts1ck>	grawity: sorry yea sure
<bellbreaker>	the text in my dzen2 bar has not changed size either.
<saivert>	pvinis: seems like that grc thing is what you want.
<saivert>	just need to make everything you type in bash go via that. a small while read line loop would do
<saivert>	unless there is a way to catch any command entered on the prompt
<sbrg>	tomty89: in case you're interested, i whipped up a script that parsed the pacman logs and downgraded every single package we upgraded during the full system upgrade and stuff seems to work now
<_mel_>	hello. i'm new to arch because mint don't run on the latest macbook air. but as i expected, i ran into some problems. the most annoying thing is a switched key on the keyboard. i have fond some settings for xmodmap, but i'd like to change it for the console too. can somebody tell me how to translate the xmodmappings into some "global" mappings? i tried to set the mapping via /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/iso_layout but it has no effect.
<furah>	well guys, the gods of rebooting 50 times to solve something have forsaken me. i'm off to cry myself to sleep.
<cazou>	hello guys ! i don't think this is directly related to archlinux but since you are the best (yes, i'm trying to make you like me), i'll ask here
<tigrmesh>	sbrg, would you be willing to share that?  like on sprunge or pastie or on a gist if you have a github account?
<tigrmesh>	_mel_, there are some links here  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/beginners%27_guide#keyboard_layout
<phrik>	title: beginners' guide - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<cazou>	i'm using kde (4 or 5, doesn't matter) and i'd like usb devices to be mounted from the device notifier with the write cache deactivated
<sbrg>	tigrmesh: well, it is kind of all over the place. let me kind of stitch it together
<tigrmesh>	k
<_mel_>	yeah, but i never used loadkeys. maybe there is some converter from xmodmap to loadkeys
<guiburgueira>	is chromium good?
<mrelendig>	it is the least crappy browser
<mrelendig>	not that that is saying much
<tigrmesh>	sbrg, hold off on posting that for a few minutes.  i'm rebooting
<sbrg>	tigrmesh: kk
<vohof>	guiburgueira, yes, loads website fast.
<t-ask>	why do i get a "failed to set the boot flag on /dev/mapper/vgroup--lvm-root" with syslinux?
<vohof>	but the primary reaason to use chrome is the devtools
<vohof>	it's the best thing ever made
<mrelendig>	syslinux doesn't support booting from lvm
<mrelendig>	keep your /boot off it
<t-ask>	mrelendig: i wonder why i never saw this error before with -iam
<tigrmesh>	sbrg, back.  you can paste the link whenever you like now  :)
<mrelendig>	and keep the boot flag on /boot
<t-ask>	mrelendig: i put my boot flag on the luks encrypted device /dev/vda1 now
<guiburgueira>	my gnome doesn`t allow me to change the keyboard layout =s
<mrelendig>	guiburgueira: how are you trying to change the layout?
<guiburgueira>	tried alt+f2 loadkeys..
<mrelendig>	guiburgueira: pebcak!
<guiburgueira>	tried the option in menus
<mrelendig>	guiburgueira: loadkeys is for tty only, not x
<mrelendig>	top-right -> settings -> keyboard -> input devices
<mrelendig>	under inpit sources click the +
<mrelendig>	add the layout you want
<guiburgueira>	the button add ins`t available
<guiburgueira>	dunno why
<mrelendig>	because you didn't highlight a layout?
<guiburgueira>	the list is empty to me, so i click to write manually
<mrelendig>	+ -> type name -> click on result -> click add
<mrelendig>	or + -> the three vertical dots
<mrelendig>	or "others"
<guiburgueira>	wtf, the windows was `compressed`
<guiburgueira>	in its minimal size
<guiburgueira>	no options was available
<guiburgueira>	solve..
<guiburgueira>	solved.*
<guiburgueira>	gnome laughs in my face for sure..
<p67>	hi there. i'm trying to use systemd for user processes in centos7 (systemd version 208). but when i try to do anything with systemctl --user i get the error "failed to get d-bus connection: unable to autolaunch a dbus-daemon without a $display for x11"..
<p67>	how can this be helped? am i missing something?
<mrelendig>	p67: this is not #centos
<mrelendig>	so you should clearly uninstall centos and install arch instead
<p67>	mrelendig: woopsie.. posting in autojoined chat ftw

<tanj>	hey, i have journald not logging anything anymore (except service restarts). not sure why
<tanj>	everything is up and running (service, sockets..)
<tomty89>	journal file borked? lol
<tomty89>	try rm -r /var/log/journal if it's alright :p
<tanj>	tomty89: no way
<tomty89>	okay *shrug*
<pid1>	lol
<sbrg>	tomty89: could be yeah
<tanj>	next time i have a customer with db issue i'll ask him to delete the db
<tanj>	"might fix your problem"
<tomty89>	that's different
<tanj>	technically no
<tomty89>	what in journal can be garbage
<pid1>	tanj, those aren't even close to equivalent
<tanj>	i don't want to delete my old logs
<tanj>	well journal is several files fwiw
<tomty89>	try to "recover" them then
<pid1>	so cp the journal file to your home directory
<pid1>	save a copy and let journalctl rebuild
<tomty89>	snapshot it, or tar it
<tanj>	ok, i'm trying journalctl --verify
<tomty89>	i remember it borked one time for me because nilfs had some trouble
<tomty89>	and because i'm my own client so i just rm -r it
<tomty89>	but, it failed :o
<tomty89>	have to deal with the fs a bit before i can even do it...
<tanj>	i can't do that as a business practice unfortunately :)
<tomty89>	tanj: eh btw
<tomty89>	tanj: the journal has a size limit anyway
<tanj>	there are some corrupt files yeah
<tanj>	oh,
<tomty89>	tanj: make sure you set it to unlimited and buy some more spare harddrives :p
<tanj>	but tomty89 tbh i think the issues started when the disk was 100% full
<tomty89>	lol
<tomty89>	that's...
<tomty89>	amusing, sorry
<tanj>	but i would have thought that journald was protected against that kind of corruption
<tomty89>	hmm you might file a feature request maybe
<tanj>	as far as i understand it should switch to a new file
<tanj>	when an older is corrupted
<tomty89>	that's a high expectation isn't it
<pid1>	oh look, tomty's solution was correct!
<tanj>	archived and active journals take up 110.5m on disk.
<pid1>	!next
<phrik>	another satisfied customer! next!
<tomty89>	i thought you just want it to stop logging when it's full
<tanj>	there's a bunch of space so idk why it's not logging anymore

<tanj>	tomty89: hey, the systemmaxuse opt seems plausible - journal files are 991m out of 9.9g so that would be 10%. but isn't there a way to tell journald to autopurge the old files?
<tomty89>	tanj: it should do that automatically

<tomty89>	emacs highlight it when i tab :o
<mirazi_heket>	i use gedit, so far nothing else to code in
<mirazi_heket>	didn't found
<lmnop__>	just use um emacs or vim
<tomty89>	seems it highlight when i space as well
<dagle>	tom^: mk masterrace?
<lmnop__>	wut mode is it in
<tomty89>	probably a warning for everything
<tomty89>	gnumakefile mode
<lmnop__>	hmm
<tom^>	dagle: tup masterrace
<dagle>	nah, mk all day.
<dagle>	i include 8 to 12 mk files before i even start to build any file.
<tomty89>	lmnop__: but the highlight will be gone if i start typing letter
<mirazi_heket>	for sure not vim
<tomty89>	why
<mirazi_heket>	because of weird keybinds
<lmnop__>	i use emacs more and more but that doesnt ring abell
<tomty89>	hmm i started with a flame question
<dagle>	objtype=arm mk install; cd 9/bcm; mk install; <- why i love mk
<dagle>	if only linux was that simple.
<dagle>	but it isn't.
<mirazi_heket>	is it possible to turn on exit codes after command in terminal? remember such thing from archiso
<dagle>	you mean displaying them in your prompt?
<mirazi_heket>	line after, before hostname (it was like that in archiso)
<tomty89>	zsh gives you a :(
<s00pcan>	my prompt is empty
<tomty89>	(in archiso)
<r4sp>	someone with experience configuring nginx and php-fpm?
<tomty89>	!anyone
<phrik>	nope, just you
<grazzolini>	r4sp: experience yes. doing it for free, no
<grazzolini>	r4sp: unless you come up with a problem
<sledgehammer>	r4sp, something wrong with the info in the wiki?
<r4sp>	yes i have one, im not using the configuration in the wiki because im migrating it from my old debian. i have two sites one is running laravel and the other is for javascript applications. the second is working but the first does not
<tomty89>	!thewiki
<phrik>	the wiki is full of lies!
<grazzolini>	r4sp: you can't expect to put debian conf on arch and it keep working
<tomty89>	eh
<grazzolini>	r4sp: my suggestion? start from scratch
<r4sp>	yep i know i changed some routes and cehcked up some paths
<r4sp>	i did in fact i just used the config as a cheatsheet and wrote it again but dont know what is wrong, ill try again
<tomty89>	why don't you start with definining "not working"
<grazzolini>	r4sp: it's throwing any errors?
<r4sp>	nop the config is ok
<r4sp>	i mean
<r4sp>	no errors when starting the service
<r4sp>	let me try to explain myself properly
<grazzolini>	ok
<r4sp>	here is the site that is actually working: http://kopy.io/mouv1 it's pointing to /srv/www/dvi and my works there are running fine in localhost:3000
<phrik>	title: kopy.io (at kopy.io)
<r4sp>	is kopy.io alright or you have any other preference?
<tomty89>	you can keep going
<r4sp>	now i'm going to explain the issue. when i go to localhost i see the welcome nginx page what makes me think about checking the nginx.conf. i wrote it from scratch http://kopy.io/4xhq3
<phrik>	title: kopy.io (at kopy.io)
<r4sp>	the important thing there is the include that points to sites-enabled. i believe the conf is working because the dvi site is working on port 3000 but the default site is not and thats the problem
<r4sp>	so here comes the config from the default site http://kopy.io/offfw
<phrik>	title: kopy.io (at kopy.io)
<r4sp>	the root is pointing to laravel public and what i checked up is that here in arch the php-fpm sock is in a different path so you may notice that i've changed it line 29
<sysgh0st>	got some rather strange boot troubles. during boot, the computer can suddenly semi-hang. (computer is not responding, but there is some disk activity). this happen at random points during the boot. i have to force it off (power button > 4 sec) and then boot it up again. after around 3-8 retries, the computer boots normally as nothing happened.
<sysgh0st>	at first i suspected hardware faults, but after a rather long session with memtest and a few hours of cpu burn in to test stability i could not find any faults. even more strange: linux mint, on another partition, boots up without any whatsoever problems. thuis only happens with the current arch install.
<sysgh0st>	where do i begin to look?
<tomty89>	journal?
<sysgh0st>	ah thought so too. where are old jopurnals from previous boots stored?
<tomty89>	sysgh0st: man journalctl for -b
<lirux>	i'm getting this messages on  journalctl any idea why?
<lirux>	error @wl_cfg80211_get_station : wrong mac address, mac = 98:4b:d2:4c:79:e4
<tomty89>	r4sp: so what happen when you visit the site?
<niel>	is there something better than nm-applet its really buggy  for me
<niel>	wont autoconnect to wifi doesnt always show bars
<r4sp>	tongcx: when i visit my site i see the nginx welcome page
<niel>	it says in disconnected but here i am
<r4sp>	tomty89: when i visit my site i see the nginx welcome page
<tongcx>	r4sp: what?
<r4sp>	tongcx: sorry , wrote wrong..
<r4sp>	and also if i try to visit for exmaple a php file like test.php i get "no input file specified"
<sudokode>	we built this city
<s00pcan>	grand funk railroad?
<sudokode>	uhhhh
<sudokode>	is it?
<sudokode>	or is it starship?
<sudokode>	!yt we built this city on rock and roll
<phrik>	sudokode: starship - we built this city - youtube: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1b8ahissyq>
<s00pcan>	my dad reminds me about it, since they went to the same high school as us
<sudokode>	yeah starship
<niel>	what irc client yall use hexchat is not liking arch
<s00pcan>	ah, so i got that wrong
<sudokode>	niel: weechat
<dagle>	there is a patch for android (not in aosp) that gives you one extra bar when connected to at&t.
<tomty89>	 r4sp: should "location /" exist?
<cupantae>	s00pcan: i only know grand funk as homer's favourite band :)
<niel>	sudokode, ill give it a try
<grazzolini>	niel: i use hexchat
<niel>	for some reason the marker is not showing
<s00pcan>	cupantae: ah i don't remember that.  need to rewatch that series...
<niel>	like where you type
<grazzolini>	niel: marker?
<niel>	the blinky thing
<niel>	in the input box
<sudokode>	s00pcan: i've had this song in my head since this thing in baltimore started
<cupantae>	s00pcan: at least according to the hullapolooza one. niel: i use irssi anyway
<r4sp>	tomty89: i needed it for laravel to know how to redirect the url, is it wrong?
<sudokode>	i'm originally from baltimore
<scimmia>	niel, theme problem?
<pid1>	tomty89, that's highlighting your trailing whitespace.
<s00pcan>	yeah irssi
<s00pcan>	so i just got a third monitor at work, sudden urge to extend this arch vm to use it
<niel>	scimmia, it might be
<sudokode>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wannqr-vcx0
<phrik>	title: jefferson airplane -white rabbit- - youtube (at www.youtube.com)
<niel>	i only have one monitor
<niel>	and tons of channels
<sudokode>	might be too early in the day for this song
<niel>	irssi is not good for this situation
<pid1>	hexchat. i haven't had any issues.
<sysgh0st>	found the pint where the computer get stuck during boot on random basis. every time, the last lines in the logs are: http://sprunge.us/bmre
<sysgh0st>	s/pint/point*
<sudokode>	niel: http://a.pomf.se/czirsj.png
<tomty89>	r4sp: maybe not
<niel>	sudokode, with my amount of channels :/
<niel>	like 50
<tomty89>	r4sp: but i think you should just include fastcgi.conf instead of the two lines
<sudokode>	that'd easily fit down the side of my screen
<s00pcan>	how is irssi not sufficient for 50 channels
<sudokode>	you don't even have to show the buffers, but i prefer to
<niel>	cause i like clicking around
<sudokode>	i can't keep track of the numbers
<tomty89>	r4sp: cd /etc/nginx; diff fastcgi.conf fastcgi_params
<sudokode>	weechat and irssi are non-click
<r4sp>	tomty89: okey ill give it a try
<sudokode>	actually, they might be able to do some mouse stuff because ncurses
<teraflop>	sudokode: i click in weechat ^
<sudokode>	but it's ehhh
<sudokode>	clicking in a terminal is weirder than clicking in x
<s00pcan>	irssi mousewheel works to scrollback, but tmux is interfering with it.  sends up/down keys with it.  i pointed this out to the dev with the git change about it...
<niel>	hell ill try it
<sudokode>	in x, you can click a very precise location, in ncurses, you've got a block essentially that matches your font size
<niel>	hopefully it likes my bouncer
<sudokode>	so you have to click over a lot of pixels
<sudokode>	that makes it rather awkward
<r4sp>	tomty89: i'm using a simple default config to try to avoid that welcome page. http://kopy.io/lxe71 and im placing a index.php in /srv/www with a echo hello world
<sudokode>	more accurate than gpm, but still
<phrik>	title: kopy.io (at kopy.io)
<r4sp>	tomty89: as you can see i included the fastcgi.conf
<tomty89>	r4sp: /etc/nginx should be unnecessary
<tomty89>	r4sp: but does it work?
<tomty89>	r4sp: make sure /srv/www have no index.html or index.htm
<r4sp>	tomty89: it is not working, just a few folders and a index.php. gonna remove the /etc/nginx
<r4sp>	tomty89: in fact i think i need it because the config file is placed in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
<r4sp>	tomty89: if i dont specify /etc/nginx he is not going to find it?
<tomty89>	r4sp: ah right just about to say that
<r4sp>	tomty89: well the main trouble is im getting all the time the welcome page and i dont really know why
<r4sp>	tomty89: i changed the port and put 2000 then i go to localhost an i get "no input file specified" lets check that out
<tomty89>	r4sp: wait is /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default a directory?
<tomty89>	r4sp: is the conf of the working one also inside?
<tomty89>	(if so)
<r4sp>	tomty89: nop defualt is a config file
<tomty89>	ah okay
<r4sp>	tomty89: and nginx is loading it because if i write something wrong the service is not starting
<s00pcan>	ok, virtualbox guest on two monitors wasn't too difficult
<s00pcan>	xmonad really shines with more than one
<tomty89>	r4sp: i was just afraid you expect * to work recursively
<tomty89>	r4sp: are you sure php-fpm is up and configured correctly?
<r4sp>	tomty89: systemctl says its running active
<r4sp>	tomty89: what should i check?
<tomty89>	hmm
<cupantae>	what's the point in leaving the channel 3 minutes after posting your question
<cupantae>	seriously like
<holomorph>	lol
<r4sp>	tomty89: gonna try https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/nginx#error:_no_input_file_specified

<r4sp>	tomty89: im afraid i dont have too much time now i have a class in 30 minuts
<crendel>	hiya, fairly new user here. an ignorant question: is there any centralized place to read summaries of changes made in new versions of packages? like if i want to know what sorts of changes were made in the latest kernel update, or the latest gnome-shell update, without literally looking into the code for diff. i notice there's sometimes changelog d
<crendel>	etails in comments on packages in the repositories or on upstream sites, but is there some kind of centralized changelog i'm missing?
<tomty89>	r4sp: i try to paste the the simple conf you pasted into my nginx.conf, phpinfo() shows up
<halosghost>	crendel: nope
<keenerd>	crendel: not really.
<tomty89>	r4sp: although only when i specify index.php
<morning_star>	heya arch
<keenerd>	the changelogs are mostly meaningless and aren't really used.
<halosghost>	crendel: there is actually a way for packagers to add a changelog, but no one uses it and it's for changes to the package, not to the thing being packaged
<vodik>	crendel: gnome has their own changelog you can read
<r4sp>	tomty89: it seems to be the a fastcgi problem
<vodik>	!g gnome changelog 3.16
<phrik>	vodik: gnome 3.16 release notes: <https://help.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/3.16/>
<vodik>	crendel: https://github.com/gnome/gnome-shell/blob/master/news
<phrik>	title: gnome-shell/news at master · gnome/gnome-shell · github (at github.com)
<crendel>	ah, okay, cool. thanks for the links for gnome in particular
<r4sp>	tomty89: you did something with php-cgi appart from the install?
<crendel>	are there any good habits you guys have with finding details of changes before you make potentially system-breaking upgrades, or do you tend just to debug after upgrading if necessary?
<tomty89>	r4sp: no just php-fpm and nginx
<r4sp>	tomty89: where do you have your php-fpm conf, can you share it?
<tomty89>	r4sp: the default one, i just installed it lol
<crendel>	i just don't know if i should be blindly syu-ing or if i should be hunting down details for important things like the kernel or de and so on
<r4sp>	fuck :(
<r4sp>	something is just wrong because i'm just opening localhost and welcome message appears, it shouldnt
<namarrgon>	crendel: -syu when you can afford the time to fix something if an update goes wrong
<tomty89>	r4sp: actually after refresh it shows my index.php correctly without me specifying it
<tomty89>	just "localhost" works
<holomorph>	yay 4.0.1
<tomty89>	r4sp: maybe something to do with your main conf?
<namarrgon>	crendel: watch the news, the arch-dev-public and arch-general lists and you'll be fine
<crendel>	namarrgon: ok, thanks! :)
<vodik>	crendel: blind -syu is pretty much 99.99% fine. and when its not fine, it refuses to work
<tomty89>	!ix
<phrik>	curl -f 'f:1=<-' ix.io
<vodik>	crendel: and that's a sign you have to check the news.
<crendel>	vodik: great. just wanted to check what was usual for everyone else. thanks!
<crendel>	haven't had any problems so far with what i've been doing, but just wanted to make sure i wasn't being stupid
<vodik>	crendel: regression in software is a different thing, but that's something to address case-by-case (and you can usually just downgrade okay)
<tomty89>	r4sp: http://ix.io/icb
<tomty89>	r4sp: just the default nginx conf with your simple server conf pasted into it
<r4sp>	tomty89: i changed it :(thats is your nginx.conf right?
<godginrai>	crendel: blind syu is normally fine, but if you just check the news and the "pacman issues" subforum on the bbs for anything that looks related to your software, you are unlikely to run into any unknown problems
<r4sp>	okey
<r4sp>	let me try
<tomty89>	r4sp: change the original 80 to 8080 and /srv/www to /srv/http
<tomty89>	*changed
<chriswarrick>	what drivers/special procedure does this wireless usb dongle need? bus 004 device 005: id 1286:1fab marvell semiconductor, inc. 88w8338 [libertas] 802.11g
<crendel>	thanks guys, this community is so supportive and awesome
<tomty89>	r4sp: btw systemctl status nginx.
<tomty89>	might tell you something
<tomty89>	actually better `journalctl -f -u nginx`
<keenerd>	crendel: the 'pacmatic' tool will try to give you some warnings.
<xace>	does anyone know of a calculator that acts sort of like mathematica / wolframalpha.com ? what i'm after is simple querys for stuff like: 1usd in euro, or 20:42+2h33m and some other simple math things
<r4sp>	tomty89: trying, no errors same problem
<crendel>	keenerd: oh sweet, thank you! will check into it
<r4sp>	if i put a character in the middle of the conf and try to start nginx it fails so i believe the service is taking it
<tomty89>	r4sp: is it your browser's problem :p
<tomty89>	r4sp: anything from the journal?
<r4sp>	tomty89: same issue with iceweasel
<r4sp>	this is desperating xd 3 hours with this
<crendel>	keenerd: does it play well with packer?
<tomty89>	no idea then, i just got nginx and php-fpm, all i modified is /etc/nginx/nginx.conf, which is what i pasted
<namarrgon>	great, now wpa_supplicant sports an epoch, too
<halfwit>	hey now.
<holomorph>	:|
<tomty89>	r4sp: permission/ownership problem?
<r4sp>	tomty89: what if i remove everything and reinstall again?
<keenerd>	crendel: some people say it does, but i strongly advise against it.
<tomty89>	r4sp: you can try *shrug*
<godginrai>	crendel: pacmatic and packer both wrap pacman, so i would say that their uses overlap rather than play into each other
<r4sp>	tomty89: what is shrug?
<tomty89>	!shrug
<phrik>	¯\(º_o)/¯
<tomty89>	!shrug2
<phrik>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<tomty89>	!shrug3
<tomty89>	oh okay, only two
<holomorph>	namarrgon: revert to 2.3… interesting
<godginrai>	the first shrug is creepy
<r4sp>	tomty89: im watching the process php-fpm is running under http user and so is the nginx process
<keenerd>	(i'm assuming you mean adjusting packer's pacman path.)
<tomty89>	r4sp: my /srv/ and /srv/http is 755 and my index.php is 644, all own by root:root
<grazzolini>	r4sp: i had some issues with php-fpm that i could only solve after stracing it. it had to do how the variables are passed to it.
<tomty89>	r4sp: seems nothing special is required
<godginrai>	r4sp: http://tfd.com/shrug
<phrik>	title: shrug - definition of shrug by the free dictionary (at tfd.com)
<namarrgon>	holomorph: yeah, the whole situation got rather ugly
<zatherz>	hi
<holomorph>	i wonder what the hostap ml looks like
<crendel>	keenerd, godginrai: ok, thanks
<zatherz>	today my netbook lost internet again
<zatherz>	brb, gonna dmesg
<r4sp>	lol
<r4sp>	tomty89: i reisntalled php-fpm and now welcome nginx page is not appearing
<r4sp>	in the localhost page and that is good because it shouldnt
<tomty89>	so it works?
<r4sp>	no because im getting "no input file specified"
<r4sp>	its a small step
<tomty89>	r4sp: anything in journal get logged for the nginx unit?
<r4sp>	let me see
<tomty89>	maybe some extra info
<r4sp>	fuck yes now im getting erros
<zatherz>	here's dmesg: https://ptpb.pw/kchs

<zatherz>	*dmesg
<zatherz>	it's happening randomly
<grazzolini>	r4sp: my suggestion. reinstall everything, both nginx and php-fpm and make sure that no configuration files where kept and that you got vanilla conf. start from there. it seems like a classical problem of too much tinkering.
<r4sp>	i have to walk a few meters wait 5 mins
<tomty89>	r4sp: so your php.ini
<zatherz>	sometimes as soon as i start the computer, sometimes even about 20 hours after
<r4sp>	tomty89: i will
<zatherz>	i tried googling to no avail
<sudokode>	stop confusing the poor dma :(
<tomty89>	r4sp: take your time. i think we got it
<zatherz>	modprobe -r ath9k and then modprobe ath9k makes the network device totally disappear
<grazzolini>	i love these error messages!
<grazzolini>	"we could be confusing the dma engine"
<cupantae>	zatherz: yeah, don't rm the module, but maybe try using rfkill to block and then unblock the switch (if it exists), and then connect again?
<tomty89>	zatherz: it doesn't comes back?
<zatherz>	tomty89: no
<tomty89>	zatherz: try modprobe -r ath9k; systemctl restart systemd-udev-trigger

<zatherz>	now the dev is neither in rfkill nor in ip link list

<cupantae>	zatherz: i've had some laptops with intermittent wifi trouble. maybe this is obvious to you, but pay attention to when you've suspended or updated, because either can cause problems until you next reboot
<zatherz>	well, the network worked after waking up from a suspend
<zatherz>	no updates done in the time
<cupantae>	zatherz: but even still, it might start acting up a little later.
<cupantae>	if you find out some process to fix that, please let me know. as far as i'm concerned, suspending does not play well with laptop wifi.
<zatherz>	is there a big chance it's physical damage?
<zatherz>	because i'd prefer if it'd be not :p
<cupantae>	i don't know. unfortunately, i think the only way to check that is by spending some time testing on windows
<zatherz>	or another distro
<cupantae>	well then you can't be sure
<zatherz>	kinda, but i can be sure that it's not an update that caused it
<zatherz>	*i can then be sure
<tomty89>	the "call trace" thing is suspicious
<trivia_man>	can someone eli5 chmod for me?
<cupantae>	oh yeah, if you get a positive result with another distro, you can be sure it's not damaged, you're right there.
<zatherz>	tomty89: "irq 17: nobody cared"

<godginrai>	trivia_man: but there are tools for doing what you are trying to write a script for
<grazzolini>	trivia_man: it's not that hard. by the way, i also do this for every conf file i change.
<zatherz>	thank you very much for noticing that tomty89
<tomty89>	zatherz: it exists right after boot before?
<c0de1>	namarrgon, , yes i am, gnome 3
<godginrai>	there's even a gnu utility that people are using for it, iirc
<zatherz>	tomty89: yes
<namarrgon>	c0de1: which gpu and driver are you using?
<godginrai>	although the name is escaping me atm
<zatherz>	tomty89: it was always there i think
<c0de1>	gtx 750ti, i have both nvidia and nvidia-lts installed
<zatherz>	tomty89: i remember seeing some call trace thinking it was a kernel panic of some sort that automatically resolved itself
<c0de1>	349.16-1 i believe
<tomty89>	zatherz: according to official docs, irqpoll is "intended to get systems with badly broken firmware running."
<godginrai>	trivia_man: gnu stow, that's what it was called
<trivia_man>	grazzolini: i was just asking if my install script looks ok...
<namarrgon>	c0de1: boot into the multi-user.target, set up ~/.xinitrc to run gnome, run startx and post the xorg log
<c0de1>	do i need to run mkinitcpio?

<earnestly>	zatherz: cat /dev/kmsg, csv
<zatherz>	sed 's/\[.*\] \(.*\)/\1/' should work
<grazzolini>	trivia_man: and i told you to copy files manually. that way you will only have the dotfiles that matter.

<s00pcan>	the absolute worst thing is how terrible moving around with the keyboard is.  i'm so used to xmonad now that i just fumble around through windows until i find what i want, instead of instantly going directly to it

<scimmia>	tomty89, i'm not saying that it's the problem, but i notice 4th gen core in an earlier post, so i have to make sure

<zatherz>	i use fish and it helps a lot with that
<c0de1>	hmm
<zatherz>	there's funced to edit functions and funcsave to save functions to ~/.config/fish/functions.d or something like that
<c0de1>	i might just stick with linux
<c0de1>	non lts kernel
<tomty89>	heh will it work?
<niel>	is it possible to have a bootable arch drive thats persistent with multiple video drivers?
<s00pcan>	yay found my bug
<tomty89>	niel: radeon nouveau intel should be fine
<zatherz>	niel: pacman -s xorg-drivers?
<niel>	so its possible i can boot it from most computers and not have driver explosions?
<niel>	cool
<tomty89>	zatherz: nooooo
<zatherz>	well, you probably need like 50% of that
<scimmia>	yeah, i've got a usb install with nouveau/radeon/i915 installed, no problems
<tomty89>	niel: unless it has multiple cards entanglement
<zatherz>	depends on what computers you want to use it on really
<niel>	yea thats not very common
<niel>	most of the computers run intel
<tomty89>	nomodeset ftw \o/
<zatherz>	no
<tomty89>	yes

<s00pcan>	i had a print statement that would do it without xrdb at one point
<teraflop>	uhm it is possible to see if cp uses --reflink?
<niel>	or do i need multiple partitions
<teraflop>	i mean how to see
<tomty89>	niel: fat/ntfs
<teraflop>	the binary?
<niel>	and arch can install on fat32 really?
<tomty89>	niel: there are some tools can read ext2/3/4 though
<niel>	yea but i dont want to install the tools on all the computers
<tomty89>	niel: hmm, i think so
<tomty89>	might not be a good option, but it's in kernel anyway
<scimmia>	don't install arch on fat32
<homerj>	nuts
<niel>	i could just have a arch partition
<niel>	yea
<zatherz>	i tried installing arch on fat32
<tomty89>	big esp :)
<niel>	and have one with my winderps tools
<zatherz>	once
<zatherz>	once.
<homerj>	4.0 didn't fix my keyboard/mouse battery reporting either
<tom^>	niel: why do you have to read your arch / from windows?
<niel>	cause its a it portable drive
<tom^>	niel: just make a partition with ntfs that you use for sharing to windows.
<niel>	i use it when fixing computers
<niel>	yep
<scimmia>	niel, on my usb install, i have a large ntfs partition first, as that's what windows will see, then my arch install after that
<tomty89>	!cloud
<phrik>	to the cloud!!!
<zatherz>	!no
<tomty89>	!yes
<phrik>	http://youtu.be/eyquj3pghv4
<tomty89>	i win
<zatherz>	!no
<scimmia>	niel, just make sure the ntfs partition is first
<zatherz>	shit
<niel>	first
<zatherz>	stuff changed
<niel>	like in gparted?
<zatherz>	duh
<scimmia>	niel, yeah, that should be fine
<tom^>	scimmia: why?
<scimmia>	because windows will only see the first partition on a removable drive
<tomty89>	gpt/mbr might be a concern as well?
<tom^>	scimmia: im fairly sure windows 7 and up copes just fine if it isnt first.
<homerj>	ok, what's up with this?
<niel>	https://www.dropbox.com/s/3zj4nymuoddjvbg/screenshot_2015-04-29_10-06-18.png?dl=0
<niel>	hows that?
<homerj>	ever since kernel 3.19, my logitech keyboard and mouse don't report power level
<tomty89>	ugh gparted
<scimmia>	tom^, i know for certain i had an issue with it on win 7
<zatherz>	ugh dropbox
<tomty89>	homerj: dmesg | grep -i logitech
<niel>	but thats fine?
<zatherz>	tmw 92g for windows & 20g for arch
<tom^>	niel: why not ntfs?
<tom^>	niel: much better then fat32
<niel>	cause macs can read fat32 :p
<tom^>	meh :p
<homerj>	tomty89, works fine, just doesn't report power
<tomty89>	mac can use ntfs as well doesn't it?
<scimmia>	niel, bios booting only? i don't see an esp
<zatherz>	i'm pretty sure macs are more normal than windows in this case
<zatherz>	as in mounting
<zatherz>	am i wrong?
<tomty89>	92gib esp lol
<buggy2k>	hiya. has anyone tested vsc yet, is it too soon to ask?
<niel>	scimmia, i have no clue how to do uefi crap >.>
<zatherz>	never touched a mac ever and not planning to do it
<diego_>	i don't think osx supports as many filesystems as linux
<tomty89>	niel: easy breezy
<niel>	and uefi has legacy mod
<niel>	mode
<tom^>	niel: for now.
<diegoviola>	but i could be wrong, i don't have osx experience
<zatherz>	tom^: would grab but no context :/
<niel>	so i can do uefi and bios?
<homerj>	tomaw, it's not a dbus entry
<scimmia>	yes, you can
<homerj>	narrowed it down to the 3.19 kernel update a while ago, just assumed a newer kernel would eventually fix it
<niel>	might try it
<zatherz>	everything is possible
<homerj>	but now with 4.0, it's still the same
<scimmia>	assuming the bios system will boot from gpt, not all will
<tomty89>	homerj: report where? which driver?
<scimmia>	or the uefi system will boot from mbr
<tomty89>	ef00 + ef02
<niel>	yea screw uefi all the schools machines are bios
<tomty89>	ah old school
<homerj>	tomty89, logitech-dj
<homerj>	it's one of those unified receiver things
<michaelp>	fresh instal... i getting login failed.... make a new user and passwd... login failed... try from cli... login fails
<tomty89>	homerj: is it still using logitech-dj? does the fall into the love of hid_generic somehow?
<tomty89>	homerj: i know. i am using one
<tomty89>	michaelp: root
<buggy2k>	does updating the kernel to 4.0 require reboot? (i mean is live patching from 4.0 and above or to 4.0 as well)?
<homerj>	tomaw, quite possibly, i haven't investigated the matter on what all it loads to get it to work
<michaelp>	tomty89: root logins
<tomty89>	homerj: that's why i ask you to grep dmesg
<tomty89>	michaelp: so you can login as root, but not the new user?
<michaelp>	tomty89: not the user or the user
<tomty89>	?
<homerj>	oh, it's under logitech-hidpp now
<c0de1>	pretty sure you have to reboot after updating
<tomty89>	homerj: two things
<c0de1>	well i did
<michaelp>	tomty89: user fails login... madea test user... it fails
<tomty89>	michaelp: how did you set password? like `passwd new_user_name_here`
<tomty89>	?
<zimi>	hey folks, is there anyone using valgrind in qtcreator?
<tomty89>	michaelp: and how did you create the user(s)?
<tomty89>	homerj: you should still see logitech-djreceiver
<homerj>	yes
<michaelp>	useradd -m -g users -s /bin/bash mike ...... passwd what  ever i made.... same with test user
<zimi>	b/c my valgrind plugin seems to be disabled altough i've got the latest valgrind package installed
<namarrgon>	buggy2k: of course you have to reboot. "live-pathing" isn't magic.
<namarrgon>	*patching
<michaelp>	tomty89: i mean passwd mike ... then my passwd
<buggy2k>	namarrgon: then what good does it do?
<namarrgon>	buggy2k: you can fix small, critical issues without rebooting
<tomty89>	michaelp: cap lock num lock thing?
<namarrgon>	buggy2k: updating x.y.1 to x.y.2 without a reboot isn't going to happen anytime soon
<michaelp>	tomty89: no
<tomty89>	homerj: how did you check the power level before?
<homerj>	tomaw, kde's battery applet, which read from dbus
<homerj>	now the only thing reported is my ups
<homerj>	no keyboard entries, on kernel 3.18, keyboard and mouse were reported on dbus
<homerj>	a while ago, when it didn't work with 3.19, i downgraded to 3.18 and it worked fine
<homerj>	then updated back to 3.19, it didn't work
<buggy2k>	wasamasa: namarrgon all this hype for nought.
<wasamasa>	buggy2k: lol
<wasamasa>	buggy2k: don't worry, i just dislike the very idea of an ide, that's all there is to it
<buggy2k>	wasamasa: sorry about it. chat got mixed up.
<tom^>	buggy2k: kexec and you skip half of the reboot.
<tom^>	buggy2k: however some hw doesnt like not being powered off. :p
<namarrgon>	it _is_ a nice feature but the majority doesn't bother looking up the limitations and what the intended use-cases are
<buggy2k>	tom^: tempting. it'll save the time of entering the password for fde.
<tom^>	buggy2k: if it works with your hw that is.
<buggy2k>	tom^: have you tried it?
<tom^>	very long time ago.
<dogpolice>	something's wrong with my install and i don't know what. my system refuses to recognize any sort of flash drives. i'm looking at journalctl and it shows that the flash drive is connected, but it doesn't appear in /dev/.
<drugo>	hello
<dogpolice>	there's an error that keeps popping up whenever i disconnect the drive: "error opening usb device 'descriptors' file."
<dogpolice>	i have no idea what's wrong.
<tomty89>	homerj: have you got solaar?
<drugo>	coping files from a remote vps with ssh (scp) is extremely slow, the speed varies between 30 and 60 kb/s. i'm sure the problem is on this arch system because i tried with another os in a virtual machine and the speed is ok, and the connection is ok for every other task. any idea about where the problem could be? scp souldn't limit the transfer speed unless specified.
<xkonni>	having some troubles with arduino in arch. http://stikked.xkonni.com/view/a7ecafb9
<phrik>	title: stdin - stikked.xkonni.com (at stikked.xkonni.com)
<xkonni>	any ideas?
<niel>	so i just install arch on a gpt table drive
<homerj>	tomty89, no
<niel>	and grub hates it
<niel>	grub-install: warning: this gpt partition label contains no bios boot partition; embedding won't be possible.
<niel>	grub-install: error: embedding is not possible, but this is required for cross-disk install.
<homerj>	it was already syned for two years and reported battery
<homerj>	tomty89, that's the thing, this wasn't a "it never worked" it's a "it worked for years, and then a kernel update broke it"
<namarrgon>	niel: uefi?
<tomty89>	homerj: idk. it's seems to me the battery status thing need some kind of interpretation of the signal
<tomty89>	homerj: which is implemented in solaar
<tomty89>	homerj: maybe something is removed from the driver code
<homerj>	tomty89, yeah, i dunno
<tomty89>	homerj: i can see battery status in solaar though
<homerj>	tomty89, but not reported by upower on dbus
<homerj>	i'll investigate this sometime and see what the problem is and patch it i guess, today isn't the day
<homerj>	thought maybe something changed that i needed to make on my system that it was different, that still could be the case
<homerj>	if it's even throwing an option into the kernel module to do it
<tomty89>	homerj: are you sure the battery level you were seeing is a valid one?
<homerj>	yes
<tomty89>	or is it just something bogus
<tomty89>	hmm
<homerj>	as in, it would be low, i'd replace the batter, back to 100%
<homerj>	as far as just things like upower working, my ups report correct battery
<homerj>	so when i ran a 3.18 kernel, i had three battery levels, ups, keyboard, mouse, with 3.19 i have one
<niel>	in gparted is msdos mbr
<homerj>	as far as debugging which package changed that caused it not to work, i did that a couple months ago
<namarrgon>	niel: "fdisk -l /dev/sdx"
<tylerdurden01>	so, how long till bbswitch gets updated to the 4.0 kernel?
<namarrgon>	0.8-30 isn't working?
<tom^>	tylerdurden01: ask the bbswitch devs

<phrik>	title: svntogit/community.git - git clone of the 'community' repository (at projects.archlinux.org)
<tom^>	so yea
<sircmpwn>	packaged this up if anyone wants to try it out: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vscode/
<phrik>	title: aur (en) - vscode (at aur.archlinux.org)
<namarrgon>	what's up with that url?
<sircmpwn>	that's the download link for vscode?
<sircmpwn>	but someone else pointed out that i failed to correctly account for 32bit
<namarrgon>	upstream url:  https://github.com/knightos/genkfs
<phrik>	title: knightos/genkfs · github (at github.com)
<sircmpwn>	oh, whoops
<sircmpwn>	that's what you meant
<jesin>	aaah
<jesin>	i just updated to linux-4.0.1
<sircmpwn>	i base most of my pkgbuilds on older pkgbuilds i've made so i don't have to write boilerplate :p
<jesin>	and now my screen is flickering
<jesin>	i'm using nouveau, for reference
<jackdaniel>	so you say - jackdaniel, don't do pacman -syyu anytime soon? :þ
<holomorph>	http://i.imgur.com/wcpbfv9.png dafuq
<slipsnode>	basically
<jesin>	i also have http://ix.io/icq in my system logs
<sysgh0st>	how come som many runs the double-"y" with pacman? i've seen this popping up quite a few times lately.
<jackdaniel>	it doesn't hurt, a few times was only cure - why not?
<namarrgon>	holomorph: i saw a similar screenshot in this channel not long ago
<sysgh0st>	afaik, there is no need to force-sync databases, unless once actually do need it, and if one do need it, one know when to use it. just curious if there was any other reasons.
<sysgh0st>	single "y" is most often prefered, as it doesn't load the servers as much as "yy". preserver resources is my motto ;)
<holomorph>	namarrgon: hm, well i just upgraded the kernel and freetype2-git, perhaps i'll try downgrading freetype
<jackdaniel>	no, only precaution, so i don't have to figure out, when i do need it
<namarrgon>	holomorph: http://i.imgur.com/oeuzt2n.png © mar77i
<jdahm>	is btrfs raid at the root volume level or the subvolume level? i'd like to create a big volume for everything that's on raid1 and then create subvolumes on that
<tylerdurden01>	woot, i finally have touchpad scroll support thanks to 4.0!
<sysgh0st>	tylerdurden01: synaptic touchpad?
<vodik>	jdahm: per subvolume
<vodik>	jdahm: its actually at the file level, but thats not exposed yet
<tylerdurden01>	sysgh0st: nope. i don't know its name.
<holomorph>	alright, not limited to vte, bitmap fonts are fine afaict
<jdahm>	vodik: hmm but what about this: mkfs.btrfs -d raid0 /dev/sdb /dev/sdc that looks like it's overall creating a raid0 and then subvolumes can be created inside that
<tylerdurden01>	sysgh0st: it's a "focaltech", actually
<sysgh0st>	tylerdurden01: aw.. i hopes it was. because i have a few laptops with synaptic touchpads that doesn't have any scroll support. i have to use the universal two finger scroll isntead.
<holomorph>	oh, inconsolatazi4 works
<anonymauz>	hello. have a trouble, installed kcm-touchpad-frameworks, but in kde touchpad settings it says that synaptics not installed or not used
<holomorph>	but consolas is fucked :d
<anonymauz>	anybody can help? :p
<spareproject>	anonymauz: you got xf86-input-synaptics installed?
<anonymauz>	yay
<sysgh0st>	general question: is there anything i should think about when updating kernel to 4.0.x? ...or is this just yet another major version bump without any actual or practical major changes ?
<vodik>	jdahm: my understanding is you still need to join the disks at the filesystem level. if you don't do it with mkfs.btrfs, you can do it live (online) with `btrfs device add ...`
<tomty89>	homerj: it's fixed upstream http://cgit.freedesktop.org/upower/commit/?id=f8104a112eb967cd4c2aaf57b5a59aafe7c4738f
<phrik>	title: upower - power management support for devicekit (at cgit.freedesktop.org)
<esc_type>	sysgh0st: nothing to worry about
<anonymauz>	i got 4.0.1 when installed bbswitch && nvidia ... it was dependency :d
<vodik>	jdahm: like -d single is also valid and iirc it the partition spans the two disks without any raid
<jdahm>	vodik: ok i'll just play around with it a bit this afternoon/evening then. i've backed up everything so i should be good to go and make a few mistakes along the way haha
<sysgh0st>	esc_type: nice. thanks
<tylerdurden01>	sysgh0st: i just upgraded and had no problems
<vodik>	jdahm: raid level is just setting replication settings, and the filesystem supports per-file settings (and per-metadata-of-each-file)
<commeilfaut>	i updated to kernel 4.0.1. now vmware requires gcc 5.1. should i wait/downgrade or is there a solution that is known?
<vodik>	jdahm: just this isn't completely exposed/configurable as of now
<jdahm>	vodik: really i just want to replace a pretty simple mdadm setup with 4 drives currently using raid5, but i know raid5 isn't supported yet so i'm fine with using raid1 instead for a while
<anonymauz>	what's bad about gcc 5.1?
<vodik>	jdahm: that's outdated. iirc the last 3.0 kernel release added the integrity checks for raid5/6
<jdahm>	vodik: oh, so it's ok to do a raid5?
<commeilfaut>	i don't think there is something wrong about it. the thing is that the system didn't prompt me to upgrade gcc to 5.1
<jdahm>	vodik: that would be outstanding
<vodik>	jdahm: so you should be okay. granted who knows how mature the code it, but the integrity checking should be there
<vodik>	jdahm: so do backups :p
<jdahm>	vodik: yeah i do backups like every 45 minutes anyway
<jdahm>	to a _huge_ external source
<vodik>	jdahm: you can test it, setup raid 5, fill the disk with files full of 0s, unmount the raid array, corrupt one disk by randomly writing data over the block device and see if it rebuilds itself
<anonymauz>	what about my touchpad :p
<vodik>	jdahm: like what this guy did: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isg_wphoajo (but with raid1)
<phrik>	title: raid failures: part 2: btrfs and zfs can be better than hardware raid - youtube (at www.youtube.com)
<sysgh0st>	anonymauz: nothing bad afaik. just that arch hasn't updated to it yet. at least not in [core] or [multilib]
<vodik>	jdahm: i use btrfs in raid1 at work, i have to say, no problems, very happy with it
<anonymauz>	so what i can do actually
<jdahm>	vodik: i do need to put a small efi partition on the first drive, but i don't think that should be a problem for raid1, right?
<vodik>	jdahm: yes, but not with btrfs. it can do raid across unevenly sized disks
<vodik>	so only one disk needs to make space for efi
<vodik>	jdahm: (by not with btrfs, i really meant btrfs won't pose a problem)
<homerj>	tomty89, thanks a lot
<homerj>	tomty89, that was above and beyond
<jdahm>	vodik: yes. thanks for the help! i'll be back later/tomorrow and let you know how it goes
<vodik>	jdahm: this is my system: http://ix.io/ic boot on /dev/sda1 only, and i created two swaps on each disk, but you could just have one just fine
<vodik>	they're a tad oversized too :p
<dacoit>	that link isnt what you think :p
<commeilfaut>	vmware-modconfig --console --install-all responds with "failed to get gcc information."
<vodik>	oh thanks
<vodik>	http://ix.io/icr
<vodik>	jdahm: ^
<vodik>	dacoit: thanks
<dacoit>	np
<tylerdurden01>	16g swap? why?
<anonymauz>	synaptics driver is not installed (or is not used). maybe i have installed it, but neither activated?
<vodik>	tylerdurden01: 32g total actually. because it got a lot of ram, serving a lot of vms for development, and i'd rather a thrashing system than an angry oom killer
<vodik>	but yeah, if i did it again i'd make both about 4-8g instead
<commeilfaut>	i need help with vmware. vmware-modconfig --console --install-all responds with "failed to get gcc information."
<jesin>	so i got the flickering to stop by installing xf86-video-intel but i suspect that should not have been necessary
<vodik>	i've only ever seen 1g swapped max
<anonymauz>	maybe aur package for synaptics hasn't got this bug
<vodik>	and thats cold pages, not because i ran out of memory
<jdahm>	vodik: what command creates that view?
<vodik>	jdahm: lsblk
<jdahm>	ah nice. thanks again
<noremi>	@commeilfaut, is gcc installed?
<commeilfaut>	yes gcc version 4.9.2
<vodik>	commeilfaut: pacman -s base-devel
<commeilfaut>	this happened after the latest kernel upgrade
<homerj>	tomty89, that works
<homerj>	just added those rules and unplugged and replugged it back in
<homerj>	keyboard at 90%, mouse at 45%
<tylerdurden01>	vodik: i don't have a swap partition and i have "just" 4gb :d
<vodik>	tylerdurden01: its good for performance to have swap, even if just a small one
<c0deweaver>	anyone here done jitsi-meet?
<tom^>	vodik: that is a matter of perspective
<vodik>	its a place where the kernel can move cold pages and keep actively used pieces of memory closer together in memory
<tom^>	vodik: the swapped out bits will be slower to access then if it just remained in the ram :p
<vodik>	swap is only a problem when you start thrashing in low memory situations
<vodik>	but the alternative is the oom
<vodik>	tom^: yes, but you hurt cache locality
<vodik>	tom^: its better to have hot pages all together than a mix of hot and cold
<tylerdurden01>	vodik: have run into oom ~2 times and i have a vm, too
<tom^>	vodik: perhaps, but i wonder how much it is even noticeable.
<tom^>	vodik: luckily this isnt floppy disks, its ram! :p
<vodik>	tom^: depends on your workload
<tom^>	sppeeeeeeeeeeeed
<dacoit>	i keep a swapfile around if i worry about oom. hate partitioning out swap, an i dont hibernate
<vodik>	but yeah, i'd totally but a swap partition (zswap) on btrfs
<vodik>	err
<vodik>	on an ssd
<vodik>	these days
<homerj>	tomty89, and in other news, what i thought was just a random kde5 bug is just how the theme works, the bar looked empty at 100%, but now i have something not 100%, that actually goes down
<noremi>	i have a bunch of drivers packaged as deb files. i installed dpkg from aur, then ran sudo dpkg -i linux* drivers don't work though
<holomorph>	great, i have to flash this alarm image again
<tom^>	holomorph: d:
<krzaq>	i have a problem with a vmware guest installation. the installer uses the network with no problems, but the installed guest only sees the loopback device. i installed open-vm-tools and it didn't help
<dacoit>	you ran dpkg -i on arch?
<noremi>	dacoit, yes
<holomorph>	tom^: starting to wonder if i should use a less fat distro on this board. not much memory
<tom^>	holomorph: wat, my rpi with 256 does just infe
<tom^>	*fine
<commeilfaut>	afaik the reason for vmare modules not building is that the kernel was compiled with gcc 5.1. if it was compiled with 5.1, the kernel, shouldnt that gcc be upgraded as well so that we use it compile whatever we want?
<commeilfaut>	i think that was a packager's mistake
<flavianus>	hey guys, quick question: `systemd-analyze blame` shows me lvm2-pvscan@<device>.service is taking up a significant part of my boot time. is there a way to disable lvm alltogether? (i am not using lvm anymore)
<dacoit>	noremi: you should consider making a pkgbuild instead. what drivers? and elaborate on dont-work
<tomty89>	homerj: funny lol
<holomorph>	tom^: i think this thing has like… 32m
<tom^>	holomorph: :o
<tom^>	holomorph: what device is this
<homerj>	tomty89, yeah, it looks like an empty bar, like something light should be in it...not the case
<homerj>	the oxygen theme or whatever
<infandum>	i see that kde is split in the repositories as it should be, with the applications independent of the de. however, it looks like not everything is solved--kmix is for plasma 5 while kdemultimedia-kmix is for kde 4, however kdemultimedia-kmix is in kde-applications-meta. as a result, i can't install kde-applications-meta. is there a way around this? a kde-applications-meta solely for plasma 5?
<noremi>	dacoit. i have a driver for my touchpad (focaltech) the drivers install just fine, but the device does not work as expected. the file name indicated that they were intended for kernel 3.19.0-rc4, i am on 3.19.3-3
<holomorph>	tom^: one of these poss http://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv5/olinuxino

<tom^>	holomorph: so slow :o
<arojas>	infandum: kmix for kf5 in not officially released, the only one supported upstream is the kde4 version
<noremi>	or would it make sense to update to kernel 4.x? is that stable enough?
<holomorph>	tom^: yeah, oomed while upgrading glibc, and here i am
<tom^>	holomorph: haha
<dacoit>	noremi: 4.0.1-1 is already in [core]
<jelle>	your in core already!
<noremi>	so i can pacman -syu?
<dacoit>	yup
<noremi>	okay, i'll try that
<noremi>	thank you!
<dacoit>	sure
<vodik>	flavianus: it shouldn't matter too much if nothing depends on that disk. its paralellized after all
<vodik>	flavianus: but to avoid it from happening, remove lvm partitions from your disks. afaik its because its assembling it just in case
<flavianus>	vodik: yeah… true that. i wonder what it does though
<flavianus>	vodik: i removed all my vg's and lv's. the lvm2 hook is also gone from my inicpio
<arch-tk>	kewl
<arch-tk>	4.0.1
<arch-tk>	download all the things
<holomorph>	longest bsdtar ever
<arch-tk>	we're only on 4.1-rc1?
<arch-tk>	wow
<holomorph>	mar77i: out of curiosity, what patches had you applied to dwm in that screenshot?
<vodik>	flavianus: udev rules
<vodik>	core/lvm2/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/
<vodik>	core/lvm2/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/11-dm-lvm.rules
<vodik>	core/lvm2/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/69-dm-lvm-metad.rules
<infandum>	arojas: really? but it's in the official repositories, not testing, right?
<vodik>	flavianus: line 94 of /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/69-dm-lvm-metad.rules:
<vodik>	94:env{systemd_wants}="lvm2-pvscan@$major:$minor.service"
<vodik>	flavianus: before you go on a quest to remove it, just remember that just because a service was started doesn't mean its blocking you from logging
<arojas>	infandum: yes but it's not supported by kde, we just build it bc some users were complaining about the kde4 version not autostarting
<vodik>	flavianus: its not like everything in systemd-blame had to finish before you got a login prompt
<infandum>	arojas: ah, ok that makes sense. does it have a targetted release date?
<arch-tk>	"my recommendation would be to cut out a 10~12 gb partition and install ubuntu or mint to play the game. i run mint 17 kde long term support release."
<arch-tk>	fuck...
<arch-tk>	no...
<tomty89>	vodik: but goto="lvm_end"
<arojas>	infandum: probably never. it's going to be replaced by a plasmoid in plasma 5
<dacoit>	õ_o

<arch-tk>	xexaxo: it's some "wtf" suggestion.
<vodik>	tomty89: it runs for all block devices

<tomty89>	vodik: hmm should we all see it in systemctl then?
<vodik>	it is
<infandum>	arojas: a plasmoid? i...guess that actually makes sense. it's more of a gui for audio control rather than a completely separate program.

<xexaxo>	arch-tk: i meant the same thing actually. seems like my use of quotes misfired.
<tom^>	arch-tk: i wonder what is causing it
<infandum>	arojas: so they truley are getting ready to do that. already, sounds good.
<arch-tk>	tom^: it depends on an old lib32-glibc
<arch-tk>	apparently 2.20-6 works
<niel>	is there a way to list all my installed package not in a row?
<tom^>	arch-tk: cant we do some ld_preoload or what ever magic?

<flavianus>	vodik: thanks for your detailed explanation!
<dacoit>	like a++++ tip calculators when the app store first came out
<flavianus>	vodik: i'll leave it in. i just thought it would be cleaner to remove all lvm stuff since i don't use it anymore
<arch-tk>	xexaxo: valve needs to get out of the mesozoic age
<holomorph>	let the forcing begin
<arch-tk>	before they get devs out of the stone age
<flavianus>	vodik: i was just curious because the scan took quite some time, according to systemd
<xexaxo>	arch-tk: that also :)
<dacoit>	chronologically false :p
<vodik>	flavianus: if you want a detailed view to see if its actually a boot performance issue, look at the bootchart

<phrik>	vodik: systemd-bootchart - freedesktop.org: <http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-bootchart.html>

<vodik>	flavianus: maybe it is, but its also possible, if nothing depends on the disk being present, its just yet another background task to be completed
<flavianus>	vodik: nothing depends on it, so it doesn't affect my actual boottime by the looks of the bootchart ;)

<dacoit>	plot > plot.svg and open it in a browser
<tomty89>	i wonder what hit his socket
<mehlon>	how does makepkg know what files are part of a package?
<dacoit>	defined in the pkgbuild
<hwkiller>	mehlon: whatever goes into $pkgdir is packaged.
<tom^>	mehlon: src/ pkg/ and your source=() array.
<grawity>	mehlon: doesn't care much, just takes everything that package() copied to $pkgdir.
<flavianus>	vodik: the pvscan doesn't even show up in the critical chain, which is nice of course!
<hwkiller>	source() tells makepkg what to put into $srcdir; $srcdir contains all files needed for building and installing. build() acts there. then files are installed to $pkgdir; package() operates there.
<tom^>	what happends if i manually move files into pkg/ dir meanwhile its compiling sources.
<tom^>	my virus.so just got packaged and installed by pacman?
<flavianus>	the plot shows the pvscan is the last service to finish initializing but getty is already up and running even before the pvscan starts
<hwkiller>	tom^: i guess so? seems like a rare opportunity.
<niel>	so i have this giant list of packages and i run xargs -a packages pacman -s --noconfirm --needed but it only says "reinstalling" for all of them
<niel>	maybe cause im chroot?
<hwkiller>	why not pacstrap?
<tomty89>	hmm super key doesn't call the "k" menu by default in plasma?
<dacoit>	niel: pacman -s - < file
<arojas>	tomty89: no
<godginrai>	tomty89: since when did it ever?
<tomty89>	really?
<tomty89>	i remember it did in kde4
<hwkiller>	nope. never did/has
<earnestly>	tomty89: you probably never used pure upstream kde?
<tomty89>	earnestly: that might be true

<tom^>	godginrai: so it gets packaged and installed without even being contained in pkgbuild and/or source=() :p
<tomty89>	stop pretend to hit me carelessly tom^ fans
<godginrai>	tom^: moved by makepkg?
<tom^>	godginrai: nah by hand this time
<godginrai>	i see
<dacoit>	godginrai: i put a sleep in build() and did touch pkg/asp-git/virus while makepkg was running
<dacoit>	*in beginning of package(). so i guess there is no problem as pkg doesnt exist while source is building
<arch-tk>	it's amazing. but i don't know why anyone would ever want to use visual studio.
<dacoit>	bad experiment :/
<dacoit>	or a small window? *shrug*
<arch-tk>	sql database manager and the ide we use both use vs as a backend.
<arch-tk>	and they both piss me off heavily.
<arch-tk>	it's like notepad but with actual features however, in keeping with the general inability to actually edit actual files.
<tom^>	 arch-tk *shrug* http://4dm7pi3anfms2bn7sk7u16h1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/visua_studio_code-1024x573.jpg
<tom^>	arch-tk: it looks cute
<grawity>	arch-tk: surely it cannot be worse than programs which use eclipse as a backend
<arojas>	tomty89: it definitely didn't in kde4 either
<arch-tk>	grawity: i've not had the displeasure of using those at work.
<arojas>	that's why ksuperkey exists
<arch-tk>	grawity: i'll have to compare one day.
<tomty89>	arojas: oh okay
<s00pcan>	arch-tk: visual studio is indeed displeasurable
<s00pcan>	yesterday i was on the 2015 version and it had a nasty memory leak just comparing files for a merge
<godginrai>	arch-tk: the only similarity between vs and notepad is that they both are bad at file editing
<arch-tk>	godginrai: "in keeping with the general inability to actually edit actual files."
<s00pcan>	the workflow is terrible, too many windows and toolbars, can't get my head in the code.  oh yeah and it's slow
<godginrai>	arch-tk: yea, but you said "it's like notepad, but with actual features".  but, it's not like notepad at all.  that *one* aspect is the only thing they have in common.  aside from both being made by m$
<godginrai>	arch-tk: you would find more similarities trying to compare it to eclipse
<arch-tk>	i meant it more as a joke.
<s00pcan>	it scares me when coworkers open notepad
<wildefyr>	new visual studio is terrible. i don't know why there are so many bad ide's out there... everyone should just learn emacs or vim and be done with it
<arch-tk>	s00pcan: wait, it gets better.
<arch-tk>	s00pcan: http://textpad.com/
<phrik>	title: textpad - the text editor for windows (at textpad.com)
<arch-tk>	i was told: "you should try textpad once, it's really good." - this person knew i was using vim but had only ever used vi himself.
<wildefyr>	a blast from the past there
<wildefyr>	with that website
<wildefyr>	lol you have to pay for it
<arch-tk>	the thing spams "thank you for reviewing textpad" every time you do anything
<arch-tk>	and it can barely scrape what vim or emacs can do.
<wildefyr>	what crapware
<s00pcan>	lol who wants to make a pkgbuild for this visual studio code online thing?  the zip is .. well haven't looked at it yet really
<namarrgon>	s00pcan: there are already one or two in the aur
<s00pcan>	arch-tk: textpad is version 7.4, what, are they keeping up with vim/
<wildefyr>	they need neotextpad soon, to keep up
<s00pcan>	aur/visual-studiocode seems to be the latest
<arch-tk>	s00pcan: i honestly don't know.
<arch-tk>	i mean notepad++ can do more than textpad.
<wildefyr>	right, i'm off to sleep, cya all
<s00pcan>	yeah notepad++ is decent
<s00pcan>	used it for a few early years of php web dev.  i actually used microsoft frontpage for a time, took six hours to remove all the junk markup from my html when i dropped it
<freezingcold>	so for shits and giggles, how well do you think running the debian kernel in arch linux will go?
<grawity>	should be fine if it's at least jessie and if you don't forget the initramfs+modules
<dacoit>	fine.
<dacoit>	no giggles to be had though
<arch-tk>	tom^: it seems libpthread, librt, and libc need to be older
<arch-tk>	tom^: as in, those are the three i needed to get it running :p
<arch-tk>	tom^: in ldpreload
<s00pcan>	ok, i'm running this visualstudiocode crap
<homerj>	why would you run a debian kernel in arch?
<bougyman>	you could use nix for that, the sandboxing of libs.
<hiptobecubic>	maybe they're trying to get laid
<bougyman>	or a chroot, container, whatev.
<zatherz>	network problem stroke again
<dacoit>	lol
<arch-tk>	tom^: yep, just chucking them in the root of the game seems to work :d
<sysgh0st>	heh... "chucking" ;) i like that new word. i'll use it!
<zatherz>	my network randomly goes down after suspending
<zatherz>	dmesg: https://ptpb.pw/ad_j
<s00pcan>	well, it doesn't know what a solution file is, so i guess this is meant as a text editor or ide-lite?  useless
<zatherz>	it doesn't come back until a reboot
<zatherz>	network card is ar9285
<zatherz>	modprobe -r ath9k and modprobe ath9k makes the device completely disappear
<zatherz>	restarting systemd udev trigger doesn't fix it
<namarrgon>	is this a new problem?
<zatherz>	after doing the modprobe, lshw -c network has "*-network unclaimed" or something like that
<zatherz>	namarrgon: yes
<openfbtd>	huh. why does mesa have systemd in its dependencies?
<grawity>	openfbtd: pactree
<namarrgon>	zatherz: when did it start? after a kernel upgrade?
<openfbtd>	it directly depends on it
<zatherz>	could it be related to my previous problems with irq?
<namarrgon>	zatherz: what problems with irq?
<zatherz>	i start linux with the "irqpoll"
<zatherz>	here's the dmesg from before booting with irqpoll: https://ptpb.pw/kchs
<zatherz>	look for "irq 17: nobody cared (try booting with the "irqpoll" option)"
<zatherz>	lshw reports the card using irq:17
<openfbtd>	grawity, it's not a dep of a dep, it's directly in the dependencies .-.
<zatherz>	and the call trace includes "ath_isr [ath9k]"
<openfbtd>	depends=( ... 'systemd' ... )
<zatherz>	the error/warning is not present with irqpoll
<zatherz>	shit
<zatherz>	i just noticed it's still there
<gabriel9>	is there a way to debug libreoffice
<zatherz>	wait
<gabriel9>	it does not start and no error :/
<zatherz>	ugh
<zatherz>	wrong dmesg (the first one)
<openfbtd>	no links to libsystemd* in the package's libs
<openfbtd>	huh.
<openfbtd>	(yes, i did use lddtree)
<zatherz>	i'm sorry, here's the actual dmesg: https://ptpb.pw/qpby
<zatherz>	there's no error/warn about irq 17 anymore after using irqpoll
<namarrgon>	you get the errors in both logs
<zatherz>	but the network problem persists
<zatherz>	namarrgon: i linked the wrong file
<zatherz>	namarrgon: here's the actual dmesg: https://ptpb.pw/qpby
<zatherz>	namarrgon: search for "irqpoll", it only shows the kernel param
<namarrgon>	they are still there
<namarrgon>	forget about irqpoll
<zatherz>	where?
<zatherz>	oh
<zatherz>	i know
<zatherz>	i mean the irq errors
<zatherz>	the network errors are my problem
<namarrgon>	so what changed before that started happening?
<zatherz>	nothing i can differentiate
<zatherz>	some simple upgrades of nothing important pretty much
<namarrgon>	have you tried a different distro?
<zatherz>	i fear there might be damage done to the hardware, although i don't believe so
<zatherz>	not yet, but i've been planning on it
<zatherz>	didn't have time
<zatherz>	i'll try it
<namarrgon>	do that, boot a live distro and see what happens
<ack006>	my improved systemd hook for mkinitcpio is up, at last: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=196755
<phrik>	title: mkinitcpio-systemd-ng: an improved, enhanced systemd hook / system administration / arch linux forums (at bbs.archlinux.org)
<zatherz>	doing a quick arch install on external drive (just to check if irq problem is there)
<zatherz>	oh wait
<namarrgon>	arch?
<zatherz>	huh?
<ack006>	arch!
<zatherz>	i had one of these installed already on a usb stick iirc
<zatherz>	brb
<namarrgon>	try a different distro, one that isn't arch
<ack006>	maybe argh?
<zatherz>	heh
<zatherz>	i'll try another arch install first, then a different distro
<zatherz>	just to check if irq problem is there too
<ack006>	i'll never switch to anything else after arch hihi
<zatherz>	i really hope this isn't a hardware problem
<zatherz>	or maybe it's some incompatibility
<zatherz>	and i just haven't noticed it before
<dacoit>	ack006: sweet, was just about to reboot for 4.0.1-1
<zatherz>	done, dmesg on ext drive
<zatherz>	now to inspect it
<ack006>	:-)
<zatherz>	shit
<zatherz>	i didn't sync fuck
<zatherz>	huh
<zatherz>	no irq error in another arch install
<ekkelett>	ack006, have you tried submitting the patches to systemd?
<zatherz>	hmmm
<zatherz>	i'm wondering if it's because i screwed something with my arch
<zatherz>	or if it's because i tested an install i didn't update in a while
<grawity>	ekkelett: that's not part of systemd though
<zatherz>	i should quickly update it
<namarrgon>	grawity: just you wait till systemd swallows dracut!
<zatherz>	i'll save all package versions to some file to later check versions
<ack006>	ekkelett: not yet, wanted to do some testing first. the initrd and initrd-preset directory support is initramfs creator agnostic
<ack006>	please see the diff for more info
<kelnoky>	does anyone know a good-looking calendar app that
<kelnoky>	i can use to popup when clicking on my status bar
<kelnoky>	(conky/dzen2)?
<kelnoky>	oh, sorry
<zatherz>	i feel like i'm getting nearer to finding what causes the problem
<zatherz>	but it can't be hardware
<zatherz>	and that's 100% confirmed now
<s00pcan>	omnisharp-vim looks pretty neat
<zatherz>	hmm
<zatherz>	i guessed expac's formats for version and pkg name
<zatherz>	am i cool?
<hillna>	hey all i'm having a random ncmpcpp/mopidy issue where if i add an album from database it's coming into the playlist with the wrong track order. any suggestions?
<zatherz>	go go go mkfs.ext4 :d
<zatherz>	do i need anything other than grub and base if all i want to check is dmesg output?
<alexwall>	nah
<zatherz>	ok, good
<bellbreaker>	is compton supposed to kill my graphics card with shadows enabled?
<zatherz>	uh, i have kernel 3.19 installed
<zatherz>	i wonder if it's this version that is only buggy
<zatherz>	with my network card
<zatherz>	that'll be checked
<dacoit>	ack006: well it boots fine lol, obviously. i'll have to find some time later to play with drop-in configurations, i've just been editing the hook manually for however long.
<zatherz>	on an unrelated note, i like how the base group has 123 packages
<ack006>	dacoit: glad you like it :-)
<diegoviola>	so is kdbus going to make it into the linux kernel at all or not? or is that already in -next?
<diegoviola>	i still see people talking about that in the lkml
<s00pcan>	bored.  finished with my work task :)
<zatherz>	i'm waiting for pacstrap to finish
<zatherz>	d:
<zatherz>	are the 123 packages in base intended?
<zatherz>	the number i mean
<junka>	123pkgs?
<junka>	just the 'base'? doubt it
<zatherz>	there's exactly 123 packages in base
<zatherz>	or pacstrap lies
<dacoit>	keen to see the keyboard module autoloading in practice. my usual nightmare is finding the right earlymodules= hid modules if/when i bork initramfs next
<junka>	i dont recall to be honest
<zatherz>	it lies
<zatherz>	:(
<zatherz>	count (pacman -sg base | sed 's/base //') shows 50
<junka>	https://www.archlinux.org/groups/i686/base/
<phrik>	title: arch linux - base (i686) - group details (at www.archlinux.org)
<junka>	53
<junka>	55*
<zatherz>	then my package-in-group counting sucks
<zatherz>	*packages
<zatherz>	i didn't even notice it ended pacstrapping
<zatherz>	now grub
<junka>	perhaps you count the pulled deps too?
<zatherz>	oh yeah, that's it
<junka>	wow
<zatherz>	123 packages from base + deps
<junka>	i just noticed, did linux 4.0.1 go stable?
<zatherz>	still damn perfect
<zatherz>	junka: i noticed it too
<zatherz>	junka: like i just pacstrapped 4.0
<bougyman>	junka: just noticed?
<bougyman>	it's been default in voidlinux for like 12 hours.
<krzaq>	plasma-meta seems to have installed no console emulator and sddm starts automatically. can i do anything about this right now?
<ldk>	pacman just got the linux-4.0.1-1 update (from 3.19.3-3), i'm scared
<escondida>	krzaq: control-alt-f2 to switch to a vty
<escondida>	ldk: the switch to the 4.0 number series is largely cosmetic
<krzaq>	escondida: doesn't seem to work
<ldk>	escondida: yeah?
<zatherz>	hurr durr ima sheep
<krzaq>	hm, i'll use arch-chroot from the installer
<ldk>	i would kind of like a reassuring blog post on https://www.archlinux.org/
<phrik>	title: arch linux (at www.archlinux.org)
<d_garbage>	that's odd sddm shouldn't be enabled by default?
<escondida>	!give ldk g kernel newbies 4.0
<phrik>	ldk: linux 4.0 - linux kernel newbies: <http://kernelnewbies.org/linux_4.0>
<ldk>	thanks
<d_garbage>	krzaq, it's very unusual for anything to enable itself by default (possible exception of dbus)
<krzaq>	d_garbage: i enabled it
<ldk>	god damn linux versioning is crazy
<d_garbage>	ah :)
<krzaq>	i didn't expect to be locked out of any kind of console
<krzaq>	kde4 came with konsole by default
<pid1>	"whatever linus feels like labeling it."
<escondida>	ldk: i'd follow the advice towards the top of the page: don't worry about it (-:
<krzaq>	plasma default is much uglier and doesn't come with it
<d_garbage>	krzaq, boot into multi-user target?
<d_garbage>	i forget the correct way but i think '3' on the end of the kernel line is still aliased to the correct target for multi-user
<junka>	d_garbage; its not?
<ldk>	escondida: i will follow that advice. thank you! ...when i'm done shaking my head in disbelief
<junka>	you need to enable the sddm service
<d_garbage>	yeah, they just said that
<s00pcan>	ldk: you actually check the frontpage?  i've done that maybe twice
<s00pcan>	one was for the change to systemd, other was for some /usr path move or something
<junka>	i wanted to ask, the journal service at boot time it takes longer and longer to boot, is that normal?
<d_garbage>	subscribe to arch-announce mailing list and you don't need to check :)
<pid1>	systemd-analyze blame
<ring0>	i realized there is an error while booting from systemd. is there a way to take care of it? daemon:err   : [  +0,047245] systemd[1]: device dev-disk-by\x2dpartlabel-linux\x5cx20filesystem.device appeared twice with different sysfs paths /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.2/ata1/host0/target0:0:0/0:0:0:0/block/sda/sda3 and /sys/d
<d_garbage>	or just idle in here. you get to hear about all the disasters happening to other people first :p
<d_garbage>	}:]
<s00pcan>	d_garbage: that's the right idea :)
<zatherz>	finally
<zatherz>	got the dmesg output of a fresh 4.0 install
<pid1>	i'm not seeing anything new in arch-announce. not since the feb xorg change, anyway.
<zatherz>	now to check if i get an error on *that*...
<zatherz>	yes!
<junka>	pid1; almost 56 secs
<teraflop>	junka: ^
<al2o3-cr>	as arch linux got kernel 4?
<zatherz>	weeeheee
<pid1>	=)
<zatherz>	the irq error is not there
<pid1>	that's why it hasn't hit my inbox yet.
<zatherz>	it's not a hardware error
<escondida>	ring0: curl -f c=/etc/fstab https://ptpb.pw and post the resulting short url here
<phrik>	title: pb (at ptpb.pw)
<s00pcan>	so 3.19-3-3-arch ahh i really need to fix my pacman mirrors, i should not be downloading in bytes
<escondida>	ring0: save the uuid if you want to delete the post later
<junka>	teraflop; ?
<junka>	pid1; yeah last post is 1.17 xorg
<escondida>	al2o3-cr: pacman -syu will tell you the answer (-:
<teraflop>	junka: 56 secs sounds insane to me
<junka>	teraflop; ikr
<teraflop>	junka: 2.217s here ^
<zatherz>	now wondering if it's because of linux 4.0 or just because of some shit that isn't installed on there
<zatherz>	update time!
<al2o3-cr>	escondida: i'm not on arch
<escondida>	al2o3-cr: ah. then yes, yes it does.
<junka>	teraflop; it started with 14secs then 33, then 44 wtf
<diegoviola>	linux 4.0.1 was moved to [core] today
<escondida>	4.01
<al2o3-cr>	escondida: great, thanks :)
<escondida>	np
<zatherz>	debian got 2.6?
<zatherz>	:d
<kelnoky>	is there a calendar app that can sync with google that is not evolution?
<arch-tk>	is debian on 1.1 yet?
<zatherz>	nah, they're packaging -1.0
<escondida>	kelnoky: org-mode, and i'll bet there's a script to sync remind with it
<diegoviola>	debian is on linux 3.x
<zatherz>	diegoviola: whoosh
<junka>	3.16
<arch-tk>	diegoviola: do you mean 0.3
<zatherz>	junka: wow
<zatherz>	junka: that's kinda old
<krzaq>	ha
<junka>	ikr
<arch-tk>	!debian
<phrik>	eww. there's mold growing on this software!
<zatherz>	!debian2
<zatherz>	:(
<krzaq>	echo "password"|sudo -s pacman -s terminator --noconfirm
<krzaq>	and i'm back
<junka>	teraflop; so what does this system-journald do anyway
<krzaq>	thanks for trying to help guys
<zatherz>	i thought your password is literally "password" and you pasted a command in the wrong place
<zatherz>	krzaq: ^
<krzaq>	no ;)
<diegoviola>	debian at least switched to systemd when they had a lot of people crying about that, give them some credit
<krzaq>	that's what i typed in the alt+f2 window
<krzaq>	that being said, it's a throwaway vm
<krzaq>	so the password isn't particularly inventive
<ring0>	escondida, the paste in ptpb.pw was empty, so here it is :) http://dpaste.com/0tmdxde
<phrik>	title: dpaste: 0tmdxde (at dpaste.com)
<zatherz>	one time it took me a while to realize i was trying to ptpb an empty file
<teraflop>	junka: journalctl -u systemd-journald.service ?
<zatherz>	turned out i did not sync and the file did not save (it was on an external drive)
<zatherz>	updatin' linux
<flaviu>	you know what would be awesome? a `date` command that parsed args like `dmesg --since`!
<escondida>	ring0: sorry, i left out an @
<d_garbage>	krzaq, you don't have to be inventive if you use passphrases instead of passwords
<escondida>	ring0: c=@/etc/fstab would've been correct
<s00pcan>	ok so do i want linux 4.0.1 yet or no
<krzaq>	that's what i do for real passwords
<d_garbage>	krzaq, for example your pass could be, "you don't have to be inventive if you use passphrases instead of passwords" :)
<krzaq>	spaces are dangerous
<flaviu>	actually, looks like i'm just dumb! date --date=tomorrow works fine!
<teraflop>	s00pcan: i did ages ago no issue at all even with brtfs
<d_garbage>	krzaq, how?
<s00pcan>	that's a crazy version bumb though
<zatherz>	flaviu: don't worry, we're all dumb here
<zatherz>	flaviu: in some way
<s00pcan>	s/bumb/bump
<ring0>	escondida, right. it's working with @ but the output of fstab stays the same
<ring0>	;)
<pid1>	s00pcan, and there's no new features really.
<krzaq>	i had a terrible situation with truecrypt. it would silently ignore spaces on encryption and my password wouldn't work upon entry
<pid1>	linus named it 4.0 because the 3.* line had gotten too high.
<junka>	teraflop; http://pastebin.com/7npeiclz
<homerj>	the numbers after the 3 are too damn high
<flaviu>	zatherz: of course, but what's humor without a few good-natured stabs at yourself?
<pid1>	it is an open source project, you know ;-) there are release notes.
<zatherz>	pid1: what is open
<krzaq>	d_garbage since then my passphrases are [a-za-z0-9] and i'm fine with that
<zatherz>	pid1: what is source
<d_garbage>	krzaq, but surely you find this out before writing anything to it?
<pid1>	zatherz, something about githangout, i think? =p
<zatherz>	git+
<flaviu>	this is even better than i expected!
<flaviu>	$ date --date='3:30pm yesterday'

<zatherz>	update done :d
<zatherz>	reeebooooot
<q9>	hi, i have device-mapper: table: 254:12: crypt: error allocating crypto tfm in my everything.log (for tcplay/truecrypt) which means a cipher is missing from the kernel. how do i find out which one?
<teraflop>	junka: is that service the one that delays?
<sysgh0st>	flaviu: out of curiosity: what's going on?
<ring0>	escondida, /dev/sda3 is a luks device with lvm for / and /home, which are the first two devices in fstab
<namarrgon>	d_garbage: already tried vivaldi?
<junka>	teraflop; yes
<flaviu>	sysgh0st: i'm writing an email, but i can't be bothered to figure out the date and time by hand.
<s00pcan>	pid1:  i imagine the note was something like "got tired of grepping for 3.19 for stuff, so it's 4 now.  deal'
<ring0>	escondida, if you like ptpb.pw better, here it is: https://ptpb.pw/le6_
<escondida>	ring0: i'm just googling
<escondida>	ring0: thank you, though.
<flaviu>	i mean, we have computers and all sorts of incredible tech. why the fuck would i have to work out dates by hand like a caveman?
<al2o3-cr>	date --date='@32452359873247123'; wed dec 15 11:18:43 gmt 1028376315 #=> year 1028376315
<sysgh0st>	flaviu: aha! i see. been there too... date calculations that is. just don't dwell into tine zone calculations. withing there, lies madness.
<ring0>	escondida, thanks in advance. no hurry
<sudokode>	flaviu: because dates are one of the most confusing things computers can store
<q9>	join tcplay
<xyproto>	flaviu: we have incredible caveman technology too, like wheels and hammers. don't forget that.
<zatherz>	wooooo
<zatherz>	no irq error without irqpoll
<zatherz>	uhh
<zatherz>	maybe i actually did upgrade the driver without upgrading linux...
<zatherz>	but that doesn't matter anymore
<pid1>	s00pcan, https://plus.google.com/+linustorvalds/posts/jmtzzliiejc
<junka>	teraflop; oh its cutted towards the right
<zatherz>	seems like stuff is fixed
<zatherz>	if not then i
<zatherz>	if not then i'll continue searching
<escondida>	ring0: oh, did you remember to include the lvm2 hook in your /etc/mkinitcpio.conf?
<teraflop>	junka: heh wat?
<junka>	teraflop; you have any idea why
<sudokode>	flaviu: if you just consider the vast number of ways people keep time
<teraflop>	junka: take a look at journalctl -b for any error/fail message
<flaviu>	sudokode: if it's confusing for a computer, it's even more confusing for me. luckily, i'm not dealing with unusual timezones or accurate timestamps. i just want to be told "tomorrow is thursday".
<ring0>	escondida, positive: https://ptpb.pw/5v0l.conf
<sysgh0st>	!next
<phrik>	another satisfied customer! next!
<flaviu>	haha
<escondida>	ring0: i got nothing, then. i'd say to search online for luks lvm $your_error . good luck.
<zatherz>	no trace of any irq problems left
<zatherz>	!give zatherz next
<phrik>	zatherz: another satisfied customer! next!
<s00pcan>	i really need to make irssi ignore nick changes
<zatherz>	hmm
<zatherz>	so i was wondering why internet randomly went down
<junka>	teraflop; maybe a bug with btrfs?
<zatherz>	now after inspecting the problem i most probably no longer have more
<zatherz>	ath9k was using irq #17
<zatherz>	the exactly same one which was being disabled
<teraflop>	junka: why do you say that?
<sysgh0st>	zatherz: problems are like that. once one look to solve them, they hide.
<ring0>	escondida, alright. seems like an error after upgrading systemd (219-5 -> 219-6). i changed nothing manually in my setup. this was working for almost 2 years. thanks for taking a look anyways
<junka>	teraflop; ooh i see many lines of my firewall blocking
<zatherz>	"failed to wakeup in 500us"
<junka>	teraflop; is this happening at boot?
<escondida>	ring0: got any luks or lvm-related `.pacnew's in /etc?
<zatherz>	how could i not be able to piece all that before ;-;
<zatherz>	s/could/was
<zatherz>	s/be/
<namarrgon>	because you're a big dummy
<teraflop>	junka: i dont know, it's your firewall, anyway i doubt your firewall start so early
<zatherz>	"root hub lost power or was reset" before the network problem too
<junka>	teraflop; yeah i just checked the timestamps, its not that
<teraflop>	junka: do you see an actual error or warning?
<zatherz>	hmmm
<zatherz>	shit
<ring0>	escondida, nope. but i found a journald.conf.pacnew
<zatherz>	i also should've checked /proc/irq/17 before
<zatherz>	would get the problem down earlier
<zatherz>	but whatever
<zatherz>	doesn't matter now
<zatherz>	i'm happy  :d
<sudokode>	flaviu: so what were you trying to do?
<flaviu>	sudokode: send an email.
<ring0>	escondida, but according to vimdiff nothing interesting
<junka>	how can i use sudo with echo
<sudokode>	flaviu: so why did you need tomorrow's week day?
<zatherz>	junka: you mean redirecting?
<zatherz>	junka: echo "text" | sudo tee filepath to create new file at filepath with contents: text
<zatherz>	junka: about appending idk
<zatherz>	i don't have to do that often
<zatherz>	and when i have to, i just do su
<flaviu>	sudokode: well, emails often are used to communicate about future activities and events, and a bit of redundancy can make an email easier to read.
<junka>	zatherz; i want to do this echo -n "enabled" > /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/mode
<sysgh0st>	"date" is a nice command to make date calculatiopns with, but it lacks the "human being" format: date --date="three full moons ago". =s
<escondida>	zatherz: tee -a appends
<zatherz>	escondida: thanks
<zatherz>	escondida: i expected it to have some kind of option like that
<zatherz>	junka: echo -n "enabled" | sudo tee /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/mode
<earnestly>	sysgh0st: --date="-3 days", though
<escondida>	junka: you can su to root or run `su -c $command > destination'
<zatherz>	escondida: [s]he doesn't have perms to write to destination
<zatherz>	escondida: unless you mean su -c "$command > dest"
<escondida>	junka: ...i cannot type today. su -c 'command > destination'
<escondida>	zatherz: yes.
<zatherz>	oh, ok
<earnestly>	escondida: ?, sh -c '...'
<junka>	zatherz; escondida i have root disabled :/
<zatherz>	why would you do that
<zatherz>	why would anyone do that
<dacoit>	then do sudo sh -c
<teraflop>	junka: heh
<escondida>	earnestly: hmm?
<zatherz>	are you using ubuntu junka?
<earnestly>	escondida: why use su?
<dacoit>	if you dont have root password/unset
<junka>	teraflop; im still searching but i found this interesting warning acerhdf: fan control off, to enable do:
<escondida>	earnestly: because i'm a foolish fool
<junka>	zatherz; no, arch wiki suggested disabling root for security
<dacoit>	zatherz: its not a bad idea
<zatherz>	d'uh
<zatherz>	long live su
<earnestly>	it's a stupid idea
<earnestly>	actually
<zatherz>	wasn't there a sudo command that logged into root?
<dacoit>	sudo su
<earnestly>	it's pretty much security theater
<teraflop>	junka: nah enable root
<zatherz>	yup, sudo -i
<sysgh0st>	sudo -s
<zatherz>	-i for login, -s for normal shell
<earnestly>	(disabling root that is)
<dagle>	wrt1900ac or not... hmmm.
<sudokode>	dacoit: definitely not sudo su
<sudokode>	that's about the worst thing you can
<sudokode>	do
<pid1>	^
<d_garbage>	lol reminds me of that song from greece :p
<junka>	d_garbage; which one
<sudokode>	earnestly: usermod -s /bin/nologin root
<dacoit>	cause of root environment?
<sudokode>	you set yourself up for some fail there
<sysgh0st>	if i understand the difference between -s and -i with sudo, one is interactive, and treats the designated user as a recently logged in user, and runs all shell rc scripts. -s just opens a shell for the designated user without any further "init". afaik. can be wrong though
<kenny164>	i'm getting a segfault on mpv and mplayer and on the backtrace libegl is mentioned (i'm not great at debugging) i'm using nvidia proprietary drivers
<d_garbage>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlknewja-ao
<sudokode>	but it's not often you have to login as root
<dacoit>	i need root pass when i get dropped to emergency shell. thats about it
<sudokode>	or when you try to use cups from the webui
<dacoit>	or rescue, forget which

<billybigrigger>	it seems the maintainer of zfs-git bumped the kernel version before i got to update to 4.0.1-1

<phrik>	title: journalctl issues / newbie corner / arch linux forums (at bbs.archlinux.org)
<junka>	i did journalctl --verify
<junka>	i got a fail and a pass
<escondida>	junka: why are you using lvm rather than btrfs subvolumes?
<escondida>	if you have btrfs
<bougyman>	because btrfs sucks big donkey nether regions?
<dacoit>	>_>
<sysgh0st>	0o
<junka>	escondida; i dont use lvm
<nixnerd>	what's up archers.
<bougyman>	i've never had any fs fail as hard as btrfs on the few hard-power-offs my laptop's been through since i went btrfs.
<escondida>	junka: apologies; i was thinking of someone from earlier
<bougyman>	i keep saying: next weekend i'll get back to lvm + ext4.... but never actually do.
<earnestly>	i've never had any fs fails with btrfs.  damn, anecdotal evidence is a pain
<dacoit>	same here
<bougyman>	i threw the panic in here, in fact, earnestly.
<earnestly>	(and i've had plenty of hard power failures, plenty.)
<sysgh0st>	btrfs is great. saved me many times. many i say!
<bougyman>	the great thing about btrfs is i always have solid backups.
<dacoit>	that is not a virtue of btrfs
<bougyman>	the features are lovely.
<ring0>	what is best practice to merge the pacnew files for shadow and gshadow?
<bougyman>	dacoit: with incremental remote snapshots at the fs level?
<jesin>	bougyman: if you mount it with the "recovery" option you shouldn't have any problems besides losing the last 30 seconds of data
<earnestly>	ring0: don't, generate new ones
<bougyman>	i think that's a btrfs thing.
<dacoit>	bougyman: you got me
<bougyman>	dacoit: my box snapshots like every 5 minutes when i'm at home.
<junka>	file corruption detected at /var/log/journal/f23168ff2d7c4cb4b7523717eb0ad36f/system.journal:000000 (of 75497472 bytes, 0%). howdo i fix it?
<ring0>	earnestly, how?
<pid1>	this may be a stupid question. but timedatectl shows that ntp is enabled, the utc time is correct, and the local time is correct. my time zone is set correctly. however, uname -a is giving me cest. why would that be?
<earnestly>	ring0: see pwconv(8) and grpconv(8)
<dacoit>	bougyman: is that nice? i've been doing rsync --link-dest incremental backups forever
<ring0>	earnestly, alright. thanks. will read :)
<bougyman>	dacoit: that's what i use on non btrfs.
<bougyman>	honestly i have no idea if it's faster or better or ....
<bougyman>	i've never benchmarked.
<bougyman>	i know on xen (vultr) btrfs was so slow it was unusable.
<bougyman>	probably some sparse container underneath of it.
<dacoit>	god that really did suck
<bougyman>	on my local ssd btrfs performance has not been a complaint.
<bougyman>	just those power outage crapfests.
<jesin>	bougyman: what are your mount options?
<junka>	is that error of mine normal?
<bougyman>	uuid=c0e30038-5e14-43cf-b646-171397c7945b / btrfs defaults 0 1
<bougyman>	none
<dacoit>	i have encrypted root with btrfs, havent run into power failure problems even though i'm a real bastard to my laptop
<junka>	seems a lot btrfs users have it
<jesin>	bougyman: there's your problem
<junka>	or used to
<bougyman>	what do you suggest, jesin ?
<jesin>	bougyman: replace "defaults" with "recovery" or "discard,recovery,ssd" depending on whether or not you use an ssd
<jesin>	bougyman: also run fstrim once after you turn on "discard"
<bougyman>	done, thanks.
<jesin>	bougyman: the "recovery" mount option uses the most recent non-corrupted tree root if the most recent root is corrupted
<bougyman>	/dev/sda2 / btrfs rw,relatime,ssd,discard,space_cache,recovery 0 0
<bougyman>	that's what it ends up with, with your opts.
<bougyman>	fstrim running now.
<jesin>	bougyman: cool
<jesin>	bougyman: next time you have a power failure, you should lose the last 30 seconds of data and then nothing else
<diegoviola>	anyone running gnome here? how stable do you find it to be, 3.16.0 crashed a lot for me
<jesin>	bougyman: it can also be a good idea to fstrim after a power failure, i think
<pid1>	!anyone
<phrik>	nope, just you
<bougyman>	ugh i need to vkpurge /dev/sda1         194241    190145         0 100% /boot
<earnestly>	nelson laugh
<shardish>	well shucks, updating to kernel 4 has ruined my plans for an early night :d i thought it was supposed to be a relatively 'small' update?!
<jesin>	shardish: oh boy, what happened?
<ring0>	earnestly, so, i just update passwd after looking in passwd.pacnew, run pwconv. then adjust group after looking in group.pacnew, run grpconv. afterwards i get up-to-date shadow and gshadow files. additionally i disregard shadow.pacnew and gshadow.pacnew. correct?
<escondida>	shardish: the version bump is cosmetic. linus got tired of the leading 3
<escondida>	(no, really)
<earnestly>	ring0: yup, as you read, shadow and gshadow are generated from the passwd and group files
<toogy>	does disabling multi-threading and virtualization (having only 1 core) really improve battery life?
<jesin>	by the way, what is the practical difference between /tmp and /dev/shm ?
<ring0>	earnestly, yes. just making sure :)
<earnestly>	ring0: you can use pwck(8) and grpck(8) to verify stuffs
<shardish>	jesin: everything broke. fairly excited though, i haven't had to roll the sleeves up for a while! just a warning to folk who haven't updated yet - might want to hold off a short while.
<earnestly>	jesin: dev/shm is before tmp was tmpfs, don't use /dev/shm anymore
<ring0>	earnestly, i saw there's a discussion in the wiki about adding info about the former two tools in 'users and groups' dated a week ago. must be some new tools?
<rena>	http://www.pcworld.com/article/2848196/ads-officially-hit-firefoxs-new-tab-page.html  so is there any official fork of firefox without this "feature"

<earnestly>	jesin: i guess if you use shm for ipc stuffs, then yeah
<escondida>	rena: get yourself an adblocker.
<rena>	i realize i can turn it off but it makes me uncomfortable that it's there at all
<shardish>	escondida: thats what i thought. he did that silly poll a while back, and it should be 3.20. wasn't expecting a night of troubleshooting! x)
<rena>	i don't really want to block the ads, i want to use a browser that doesn't have them built in in the first place
<pid1>	"official" and "fork"
<rena>	heh
<escondida>	shardish: you...really shouldn't have to do that. how long has it been since your last update, and what exactly broke?
<rena>	i should say "popular fork"
<billybigrigger>	how can i change file dependencies without installing/removing/recompilinig? zfs-git and spl-git won't let me upgrade my kernel, but the new zfs and spl packages require the new 4.0 kernel
<escondida>	rena: i doubt iceweasel will go along with that, and there are a number of xulrunner-based browsers, such as conkeror
<billybigrigger>	and i don't really want to -f anything
<rena>	i was thinking "official" as in "in arch repos" but i guess that's not quite right
<namarrgon>	billybigrigger: either build them in a chroot/vm and install in the same command or remove the zfs and spl packages, update the system and then reinstall/rebuild them
<pid1>	rena, waterfox, pale moon, iceweasel...
<pid1>	gnu icecat
<rena>	right, i don't see that in pacman though
<ring0>	earnestly, everything is tidied up now. thank you :)
<pid1>	rena http://www.basson.at/firefox-addons/newtabhomepage
<pid1>	that solves the problem as well.
<escondida>	billybigrigger: you'll need to update your those aur packages you mentioned. their maintainers probably just haven't bumped the version listed.
<rena>	not really, that's still just bandaging it
<rena>	once something ships with ads built in, i no longer trust it, even if they can be removed
<rena>	anyway thanks for the suggestions, i'll look into those
<pid1>	i mean, chromium doesn't ship with ads built in either.
<rena>	true, but i'm not as fond of its ui
<pid1>	lynx
<pid1>	!next
<phrik>	another satisfied customer! next!
<rena>	lol
<billybigrigger>	escondida: the maintain bumped the version to 4.0.1-1
<toogy>	does disabling multi-threading and virtualization (having only 1 core) really improve battery life?
<billybigrigger>	like i don't think he realised what he did, no one got the 4.0.1-1 kernel yet
<billybigrigger>	he bumped it maybe cause his mirror updated first, but left me screwed :p
<shardish>	escondida: oh i go for regular updates. the most annoying thing is that my wireless network card is no longer recognised, and the driver won't build on 4. i've got to go find a bloody cat5 in the cupboard and trail it across the living room. the wife's going to be thrilled! :d
<sudokode>	billybigrigger: wat?
<sudokode>	stable: 4.0.1 2015-04-29
<jesin>	oh goodness
<jesin>	shardish: what network card is this?
<billybigrigger>	sudokode: that's today
<pid1>	linux nostromo 4.0.1-1-arch
<sudokode>	oh he did it before today?
<billybigrigger>	sudokode: and he bumped the zfs-git package to require 4.0.1-1 as well...
<billybigrigger>	well i can't install the new kernel because the old zfs packages require 3.19.3-3
<sudokode>	billybigrigger: pacman -sydd linux ; pacman -su
<sudokode>	as an example of how to get around borked deps
<billybigrigger>	ahh, thank you wise sir

<sudokode>	ah no, that's --ignore
<shardish>	jesin: just a cheapo tp-link ac dongle - someone had kindly made a lovely 8812au pkg on the aur that had it working wonderfully.

<sudokode>	bow down
<earnestly>	:d
<earnestly>	sudokode: i was confused at first, but then i saw
<jesin>	shardish: ah... yeah, kernel modules from aur packages complicate things
<jesin>	shardish: you could try adding 'linux=4.0.*' or similar to the depends array so you get a reminder to rebuild on kernel upgrade?
<gt1>	hey i am trying to install arch on my laptop but when i boot in and type ping -c 3 8.8.8.8  it say network is unreachable what can i do

<earnestly>	wasamasa: types and programming languages is good stuff
<sudokode>	huh
<sudokode>	i assume that was an earlier conversation
<shardish>	jesin: given that the system that broke was composed almost entirely of kernel modules for aur packages, and modules i'd built, with a thin veil of arch binding them all together. its one big mess now :d
<gt1>	sudokode can you help me tro it it is confusing me
<shardish>	jesin: good point, i'll tackle that tomorrow. i've hidden the wire under the rug, lets hope she doesn't notice. thanks for the help! o/

<maltray>	yes, thanks dacoit
<dacoit>	np
<maltray>	noremi: reinstalled and it still says update-grub not found
<noremi>	first grub-install, see the wiki for more detailed instructions
<maltray>	sure thing
<namarrgon>	update-grub is a debian thing, it doesn't exist on arch
<gt1>	can i get som noob help to get on to the net on my clean arch boot
<noremi>	gt1, try getting the files via ethernet or usb media
<dacoit>	grub-mkconfig
<maltray>	dacoit - noremi, i should run that command after i ran this grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot--bootloader-id=archlinuxgrub --recheck, right?
<gt1>	noremi  idont thing it is a drivewr problem
<noremi>	dacoit probably knows better. so only mk-config because it is already installed, right?
<noremi>	gt1, so you don't have internet to download the files to install, correct?
<dacoit>	maltray: that install command is correct for an efi system. (mind the spacing after /boot)
<maltray>	i have like 6 installs of grub already :(
<gt1>	no
<maltray>	dacoit, maybe i got confused with the terminology of efi and uefi
<dacoit>	maltray: same
<gt1>	i need to setup the net
<dacoit>	maltray: you're good to go. i dont know about bootloader-id, i havent used that
<gt1>	i just boot in to a clean boot
<maltray>	it's what gets printed on the system when i press f11 to select what i want to boot on
<brookskd>	i was in the middle of an update via "pacman -syu" and my laptop shut down due to over heat issue, now strange errors are happening like ldconfig file not found and libglib saying xml files are empty.  is there any way to redo the update process or fix the broken upgrades?
<noremi>	gt1 so what type of connection are you trying to set up? wireless or wired?
<gt1>	it is wired
<maltray>	dacoit, one thing, maybe my system is not efi, rather, uefi, will the grub-install command like that work?
<knight_corvi>	i'm having a problem with my ethernet after updating the kernel from 3.18 to 4.0 (i downgraded from 3.19 because of the same problem).  i can see some of the solutions to my problem, but i would to check with you before.  one of them is to stay downgrade back to 3.18 again. the other is to try to install the backports as i read in a post, however, i would like to be able to keep track of the backport with pacman. other solu

<nixnerd>	i've set my music dir in my mpd config and my ncmpcpp config to ~/music and ncmpcpp isn't seeing my collection. what's the deal?
<noremi>	are you using static ip addresses? gt1
<gt1>	no
<noremi>	have you looked at this page? https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/network_configuration
<phrik>	title: network configuration - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<gt1>	yes
<knight_corvi>	jesin: as for errors, the upgrade goes smoothly, but as soon as i reboot the connection using ethernet the connection starts slowing down to the point that is super slow
<crazedpsyc>	knight_corvi: did you install alx yourself?
<knight_corvi>	no
<nixnerd>	fyi, music is in ~/music and it's all flac
<jesin>	crazedpsyc: according to modinfo and 'pacman -qo', it's part of the linux package
<knight_corvi>	i have to admit that i used an antergos image to install arch
<crazedpsyc>	yeah, from what i see the version in core linux is not 'full'
<noremi>	does anyone have problems with xorg after the 4.0.0 kernel update? "no devices detected" and a bunch of drivers cannot load
<crazedpsyc>	it also hasn't been updated since 2011
<crazedpsyc>	knight_corvi: you might want to try installing dkms-alx from the aur
<nixnerd>	oh and i'm using mpd as user.
<knight_corvi>	oh well, so i guess that reduces my options to what you just said
<crazedpsyc>	though it's also old
<knight_corvi>	thanks
<knight_corvi>	i was going to try the backports but those are only for 3.19 right now
<jesin>	crazedpsyc: where are you finding this "is not full" info?
<teraflop>	nixnerd: did you press `u` key while in ncmpcpp?
<jesin>	crazedpsyc: also the aur package appears outdated
<namarrgon>	noremi: post the xorg log
<jesin>	oh wait you just said that.
<nixnerd>	yes. but it looks as though i forgot to add something to the mpd.conf... at least at first glance.
<jesin>	noremi: i had some problems, yes
<encapsulate>	_raspberry_pi_driver.c:21:20: fatal error: python.h: no such file or directory ?
<encapsulate>	what is this compile error
<crazedpsyc>	jesin: err, i actually can't find it now
<crazedpsyc>	but either way, the last update to the non-builtin driver was 2013, whereas in linux it's 2011

<jesin>	noremi: pacman -qs xf86-video | curl '-lff:1=<-' http://ix.io/
<knight_corvi>	i was also considering installing linux-lts instead, but i'm guessing i might have the same problem

<noremi>	namarrgon, downgraded for now. i'll have to post it later
<encapsulate>	python is installed i'll try there

<phrik>	title: index of /pub/linux/kernel/projects/backports/stable/v4.0.1 (at www.kernel.org)
<knight_corvi>	jesin: it says that on the aur package
<jesin>	knight_corvi: then the aur package is outdated
<crazedpsyc>	probably hasn't been updated yet, 4.0 just went into core today
<jesin>	knight_corvi: which aur package is this btw?
<crazedpsyc>	guessing https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/backports-patched/
<billybigrigger>	does the arch kernel have live patching enabled by default? and what does the user need to do?
<phrik>	title: aur (en) - backports-patched (at aur.archlinux.org)
<jushur>	knight_corvi: you do use a proper cable that can handle 1gbit speeds right?
<billybigrigger>	or does this work automagically behind the scenes? no more reboots required?
<knight_corvi>	jesin: i guess i'll have to wait then. the aur pkg is https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/backports-patched
<phrik>	title: aur (en) - backports-patched (at aur.archlinux.org)
<jesin>	knight_corvi: all right i've flagged it out-of-date
<crazedpsyc>	looks like a simple change to make it 4.0.1, just change pkgver
<namarrgon>	billybigrigger: you have to create patches, nothing is automagic
<knight_corvi>	jesin: ok, thanks.  jushur: the cable is not the problem as it was working just fine before
<noremi>	gt1, try ip link set dev enp7s0 up
<billybigrigger>	namarrgon: so a kernel upgrade still requires a reboot

<jesin>	noremi: then reboot
<noremi>	jesin, will do. thank you
<gt1>	noremi ??  will it not clear all what i have don i have not install base system yet

<akiva>	ox33: yes, assymetric cryptography
<akiva>	being able to retrieve or acquire a private key from a public key would mean anyone could get it, ie. not too private
<akiva>	you share your public key on a server for others to find and use

<akiva>	you generate a pub key from a private, so to speak, because it has relative meaning to it

<noremi>	gt1 what was the error?

<akiva>	ox33: basically, you need to have your secring.pgp or secring.kbx or whathave you or else doom!
<gt1>	noremi i reboot after it and it work fine
<akiva>	ox33: easiest to understand pgp by thinking about ssh, which more people are familiar with
<akiva>	you don't give out your private key, just the public one.
<ox33>	akiva: that is all basic knowledge. thanks anyway, but i have understood that. my problem is, every source mentions that you cannot calculate the privkey to a pubkey, that would make it all useless. i am asking the other way round, but i can find exactly zero information on this matter on the internet
<akiva>	because you can't, ox33
<akiva>	i don't know why you think you could?
<ox33>	blt: thanks for that link. i see that a pgp privkey always contains a pubkey. however, would it be possible to calculate the pubkey from a pure private key (bot includind a pubkey, that is)
<akiva>	why do you not want to include a pubkey?
<d_garbage>	heh
<akiva>	go visit #gnupg
<ox33>	say i generate my keypar, save my privkey, and send away my pubkey to a friend. i dont care about my pubkey
<d_garbage>	back away slowly, keep nodding an smiling
<akiva>	ox33: not #archlinux specific. go to #gnupg
<ox33>	i then lose contact to my friend. but i still have my privkey. is that one now useless as i dont know the pubkey? no one can send me messages that i can decrypt?

<d_garbage>	unless it becomes massively spammy and disruptive than that's something else but it take a fair bit of effort and determination to get to that level
<d_garbage>	then*
<ox33>	sudokode: but that command simply strips the pubkey from the private key file that i provide, right? it does not actually calculate anything? private_key_file in this matter is not a single key, but a weird mix containing both a pubkey and privkey.
<sudokode>	ox33: right, that's what a keyfile is for
<akiva>	d_garbage: good point. i have to admit i have come to this channel regularly for a good while now and i have noticed that the general attitude and conduct has gone.. well, south it seems.
<sudokode>	if you don't keep the public key in the private key file, how would you know the public key was generated for that private key?
<d_garbage>	good :)
<akiva>	maybe it's just during certain hours.
<ox33>	sudokode: then i have never in my life seen a real, pure private key.
<d_garbage>	just as it should be, operating as normal then
<akiva>	so, i am _loving_ bspwm
<sudokode>	!shrug2
<phrik>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<ox33>	sudokode: in my imagination, when i generate a pgp keypair, it should generate two files. one for each key. not a single weird file containing both the pubkey and the privkey. that also makes it an extra hassle to strip the pubkey from that keyfile.
<escondida>	ox33: the cryptography folks in #gnupg will have your answer.
<jesin>	noremi: sure, brb
<sudokode>	ox33: not if you're using the .pem format
<escondida>	ox33: no one here seems to have the answer, alas, but the folks over there will. when they tell you, perhaps you could report back.
<ox33>	alright, i see. ill head over there and ask around. thanks anyway for all your input
<akiva>	ox33: i assure you that the folks in #gnupg are very welcoming and nice. no one is going to bite you.
<d_garbage>	^ this would be the "at the op's discretion" part }:]
<sudokode>	.pem contains an entire certificate essentially
<sudokode>	which makes it very useful being all self-contain
<sudokode>	ed
<sudokode>	ox33: openssl genrsa -out privkey.key 1024
<sudokode>	cat privkey.key
<sudokode>	now generate a public key off of that
<escondida>	d_garbage: i'm not around a lot lately (as you may have noticed), but if someone's ever ignoring repeated advice or being a pain or whatever, feel free to ping me (with a hint of what i should be looking for in the scrollback)
<rena>	haha, icecat user agent claims i'm on windows
<rena>	i guess that's to make me stand out less
<blt>	how might i debug hibernation issues? it seems hibernating wakes up about 75% of the time. the other % of time i have to cold reboot by holding the power button because hibernation awaking only shows a black screen. :(
<sudokode>	ox33: should be the same every time
<blt>	it also seems like my hiberantion issues happen on battery power which is frustrating considering it's a laptop :d
<sudokode>	either way, you're giving out the public key, not the .pem or the .key
<d_garbage>	escondida, lol that should keep you busy, then :p
<escondida>	hehe
<ox33>	sudokode: that should not be possible, technically. generating a pubkey from the privkey.key. that would mean you could mathematically derive one key from another
<sudokode>	nope
<sudokode>	well, you could
<jesin>	(sorry for join flooding, i just reconfigured my irc client)
<sudokode>	but it would take longer than the life of the universe
<sudokode>	which, if you live in america, isn't actually that long
<d_garbage>	hehehe
<sudokode>	ox33: i mean you can claim that's not possible because math or you can go look up how it works and why we trust it so much
<dacoit>	heat death is what 10^1000
<sudokode>	that decline in trust isn't due to that math, it's actually due to certain people having influenced the starting point for that math
<sudokode>	they who must not be named
<sudokode>	lest their filters start recording
<sudokode>	dacoit: googol
<dacoit>	sudokode: no u
<sudokode>	no literally
<sudokode>	10^100 years
<jesin>	sudokode, which things are you talking about?
<sudokode>	jesin: p and q iirc
<ox33>	sudokode: i did actually look at the rsa algorithm in-depth in college. the thing is, without any proper application of that knowledge, you forget how these things works in details far too quick

<jesin>	dexter, this is my laptop
<coolthingy500>	have anyone ever exchanged pgp public keys? i only had to use pgp when i used to go on tor.
<dexter>	that's funny because your laptop is my server

<sudokode>	s/college/"college"/
<dexter>	attending
<sudokode>	er
<dexter>	;)
<sudokode>	that's why it's "college"
<escondida>	coolthingy500: all just a conspiracy of cryptogaphers, you mean?
<d_garbage>	yeah, he's the janitor
<d_garbage>	!sting
<phrik>	ba-dum *ching*
<dacoit>	🎓
<coolthingy500>	how long did you attented college <sudokode>?
<dexter>	longer than you
<sudokode>	coolthingy500: if you correspond on developer lists, you often need to sign the message with your key
<dacoit>	geez, he wasnt expecting some kind of spanish inquisition!
<d_garbage>	!yt hong kong phooey
<ox33>	thats the mini-me quotes, right? my irony detector is off when it comes to written language
<phrik>	d_garbage: hong kong phooey (1974) - intro (opening) - youtube: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=va_rmpd3pzi>
<sudokode>	which means you have to distribute the pubkey to the other members
<coolthingy500>	<escondida> hard to get a hold of if you don't use their standard way of doing things.
<sudokode>	usually by just attaching it to the email
<coolthingy500>	i found that out a long time ago. this is when i hade debian back then.
<escondida>	coolthingy500: what? also, the angle brackets are added by your client, not part of the nick. just start typing someone's nick, hit tab, and your client will take care of the rest.

<sudokode>	yeah, what's with this <nick> stuff
<escondida>	ox33: "nobody expects the spanish inquisition" is from monty python
<sudokode>	makes it look like you're pasting something they said
<coolthingy500>	escondida, okay
<dexter>	monty python is crap
<sudokode>	!grab dexter
<phrik>	sudokode: tada!
<ox33>	sudokode: im embarrassed of my college actually. studying computer science and they teach us how to start an apache server and how to do bitwise xor. in the fourth semester.
<sudokode>	just so from now on, when that comes up in !rq, everyone gets pissed
<dexter>	well that escalated quickly
<noremi>	oh
<sudokode>	that's me pissing someone off indirectly via someone else's quote
<escondida>	dexter: no, stop it, stop this right now. this sketch is getting very silly.
<sudokode>	that's like troll inception
<d_garbage>	no one expects the escondidaquisition
<sudokode>	a big fuck-you to spacetime
<escondida>	it's a pig's life--er, a geek's life--on modern irc
<escondida>	haha
<dexter>	escondida: wat sketch
<sudokode>	ox33: pretty much the same here. i'm in a community college for essentially computer science and infosec
<coolthingy500>	sudokode,  well that escualted quickly.
<dexter>	that's what i said.
<sudokode>	it's so easy i can take two degrees at once
<dacoit>	...
<sudokode>	it's basically bullshit
<escondida>	dexter: the colonel often crashes monty python sketches and puts a stop to them on the grounds that they're "far too silly"
<d_garbage>	it started out as a perfectly decent sketch about old ladies attacking young men and now it;s just gotten silly
<sudokode>	you just pay a little money to avoid paying more money for a bs
<jesin>	noremi: sorry i don't really know what to do about your xorg problem =/
<dacoit>	escondida: the linux colonel?
<sudokode>	i can easily transfer all those credits over to the state university and bam
<sudokode>	get a degree with amazingly minimal effort
<escondida>	dacoit: that's the chap
<sudokode>	just have to sit through some boring lectures only to correct the instructors a dozen times
<sudokode>	!shrug2
<phrik>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<dexter>	ugh. none of my usb sticks are large enough to hold wow.
<dexter>	i'm going to have to share it over the network from my laptop :(
<sudokode>	time to join us in the twenty aughts
<dacoit>	                        wow
<coolthingy500>	sudokode,  my sister keeps web chatting on leauge of legions keeping me up all night. i just want to smash that headset.
<dexter>	i have 2 32gb sticks. wow is just over the limit.
<coolthingy500>	how much space does wow take?
<sudokode>	coolthingy500: make sure you take it off first
<sudokode>	that's a good way to end up in jail

<escondida>	it's been too long since i've gone through monty python (-:
<codebam>	why doesnt arch support i386?
<escondida>	codebam: because it's the year 2015?
<codebam>	escondida: still.
<escondida>	codebam: heck, even debian optimizes their 32-bit for i586, not i386
<codebam>	well can i run it on a 32 bit machine?
<escondida>	yes
<coolthingy500>	and you got the unix issue of 2038 which will make that system go bye bye.
<codebam>	escondida: i can? how
<escondida>	codebam: arch has always supported i686 machines--like, before it supported x86_64, and up through today
<codebam>	escondida: how do i check if its supported? is there a command i can run here?
<coolthingy500>	isn't arch iso a duel boot arch that supports i686 and 64 bit
<escondida>	codebam: when was your machine made?
<dacoit>	ya. hence dual-iso
<codebam>	escondida: i think it was custom made, but in like 2005
<zer0rest>	coolthingy500: 64 bit time is possible on 32 bit machines, it's just not implemented everywhere yet
<escondida>	codebam: it'll be i686, then
<ailuj>	codebam: i686 will run fine on your machine. i386 is a lot older.
<dacoit>	'85
<codebam>	escondida: okay, so i can install arch. ah cool.
<codebam>	dacoit: wow. that old?
<escondida>	well, yeah
<escondida>	that's why almost nothing supports actual i386
<dacoit>	codebam: the very first of the lineage, yeah
<codebam>	well im running i386 debian on it right now
<coolthingy500>	codebam,  do get a better machine with 64 bit.
<escondida>	codebam: you're almost certainly running i586 debian
<codebam>	coolthingy500: i have one. this is my dlna server machine
<coolthingy500>	codebam,  oh
<codebam>	so i'll make an i686 usb and see if it boots then
<codebam>	since this computer doesnt have a dvd rom drive lol
<escondida>	nor a cd drive?
<codebam>	escondida: it has a cd drive. but i dont have any cd's handy
<escondida>	ah
<coolthingy500>	this is off topic. but has anyone ever asked you how to download porn?
<coolthingy500>	i'm not making this up.
<codebam>	no.
<escondida>	...
<dacoit>	wut
<codebam>	someone asked you?
<codebam>	lol
<coolthingy500>	ya at work.
<codebam>	...
<coolthingy500>	one of my co-worker found out i use gnu/linux, thinks i 'm a hacker
<coolthingy500>	and he asked me how to download porn
<coolthingy500>	and last week, he wanted to put music on his ipod.
<coolthingy500>	what the hell!
<escondida>	coolthingy500: http://hackertyper.net/ ← keep that open in a tab at work, get to it when this coworker walks by.
<escondida>	!next
<phrik>	another satisfied customer! next!
<dacoit>	xxd < /dev/urandom
<dacoit>	:p
<coolthingy500>	hahahaha.
<codebam>	btrfs uses 8300 right?
<sheep>	escondida: oh god it's kernel code
<sudokode>	codebam: yes
<sheep>	codebam: 8300 what?
<sheep>	oh right
<codebam>	sudokode: thanks.
<codebam>	sheep: yea. guid code
<sheep>	that's the short form.  the actual guid is a lot longer
<coolthingy500>	ya. made up which kinda looks like i'm partioning a drive. which is not true.
<coolthingy500>	good comments though
<codebam>	oh okay
<dacoit>	this website types three letters at a time. 2l337
<coolthingy500>	ya. makes a good joke.
<coolthingy500>	well i don't know. it looks like editing and auiting on the linux kernel. without linus insulting the crap out of someone.
<coolthingy500>	do any of you guys still use flashplayer?
<codebam>	so is the i686 image just the regular one?
<codebam>	does the install cd have firmware-ralink?
<codebam>	for wifi
<coolthingy500>	i think so. allen made a remark about ditching i686 support because of the machines of today.
<codebam>	ah okay
<coolthingy500>	but 32bit is still supported.
<codebam>	yea
<homerj>	here's a question, is there any way to have pacman tell me about a new config? like what freebsd does when you do a build world
<codebam>	well as long as the install usb boots it should work right
<codebam>	?
<sheep>	homerj: pacdiff
<sheep>	homerj: or use pacmatic
<zer0rest>	coolthingy500: freshplayer + pepperflash
<coolthingy500>	zer0rest,  i got mpv and youtube-dl now. mpv works wonders, well so do other movie players.
<homerj>	yeah, there it goes
<homerj>	i thought maybe there was a pacman option to pop that up automatically
<zer0rest>	coolthingy500: add livestreamer to that and there's no need for flash
<coolthingy500>	thanks for the tip.
<codebam>	can i put it on a usb by using cp image.iso /dev/sdx ?
<zer0rest>	codebam: use dd, not cp
<codebam>	zer0rest: isnt it the same thing?
<sheep>	no
<sheep>	cp copies a file onto a filesystem
<sheep>	dd does a raw overwrite of the device and can replace the filesystem
<azalus88>	hey. having a couple issues setting up php on arch. anyone here have any experience?
<sheep>	if it's writing to a dev node anyway.  it can also overwrite regular files in a filesystem
<codebam>	not if its not mounted. it copys directly onto the device
<sheep>	azalus88: just ask your question
<sheep>	codebam: not in the case of cp
<codebam>	but okay. dd works
<codebam>	sheep: but it worked for the debian iso
<sheep>	huh
<codebam>	yea. they recommended it over dd actually
<sheep>	why
<codebam>	idk. dont ask me
<azalus88>	sheep: when i try load the php5 stuff in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf, apache (httpd.service) fails to start.
<lyonsb>	!popcorn
<phrik>	http://i.imgur.com/4ii4k.gif
<codebam>	probably cause theres less chance of destroying the device i guess...
<sheep>	azalus88: read the wiki page for apache.  you need to change some of your modules
<sheep>	azalus88: also check the systemctl status of httpd.service
<azalus88>	thanks will report back
<azalus88>	sheep: thanks that worked. i was following a guide on another site and they had listed one step slightly differently to what they have in the wiki.
<d_garbage>	<-- hum-mus (~cedar@122.155.138.106) has left this server (k-lined) }:]
<sheep>	azalus88: always trust the arch wiki first
<noremi>	anyone have issues with the 4.0.1 kernel not loading drivers? i cannot get wifi connections going
<sheep>	noremi: did you reboot since you upgraded the kernel?
<noremi>	yes
<azalus88>	sheep: yeah, yeah. i always underestimate the wiki. new arch user. i will learn eventually :)
<phreakachu>	wiki knows almost everything
<d1etyd3vil>	4.0.1 kernel. you are a brave man.
<phreakachu>	4.0.1 is in stable now
<phreakachu>	next time you "pacman -syu" you get it
<codebam>	so we can use 4.0.1 now?
<noremi>	as of today
<sheep>	codebam: yes.
<codebam>	cool
<d1etyd3vil>	wow. nice.
<sudokode>	wow the 4
<sheep>	that's what 'is in stable' meant
<sudokode>	omg
<sudokode>	omg
<codebam>	it has live updating or something right?
<sudokode>	can't wait til the 5 comes out
<sudokode>	then i can trade my old one in and get a new one
<noremi>	you'll have to -syu
<sudokode>	wooooo
<codebam>	lol
<sheep>	codebam: not for arch
<codebam>	sheep: ah. okay.
<codebam>	itll install with pacstrap right?
<sheep>	codebam: it requires some significant infrastructure changes
<d_garbage>	-ck is still having problems for some with 4
<sheep>	yes
<sheep>	pacstrap always installs whatever is currently in the repositories
<sudokode>	d_garbage: i'm gonna ditch -ck for heftig's -zen
<d_garbage>	o.o
<codebam>	is it in grsec yet?
<celti>	i upgraded iptables today from 1.4.21-1 -> 1.4.21-3 and it's stopped forwarding traffic from openvpn. even if i flush my iptables rules and just do a single masquerade rule for the relevant traffic it fails. anyone have a clue where i can start searching for a solution? (apologies if this line came through twice, my connection's being funny)
<sudokode>	i hear it has bfq and some stuff
<sudokode>	which should be fine
<sheep>	no idea
<codebam>	comes default with bfq. cool
<sheep>	celti: does iptables -l or iptables-save still show the rule?
<celti>	sheep: it does, yes
<sudokode>	codebam: you know what bfq is right?
<codebam>	interesting. 628mb on the usb, 599mb on my hdd
<codebam>	sudokode: yes
<sheep>	celti: uname -r; pacman -q linux
<codebam>	sudokode: the io scheduler right>
<codebam>	?
<sudokode>	yes
<codebam>	bfs is something else
<sudokode>	cpu scheduler
<celti>	sheep: it's a linode, so not a repo kernel; 4.0.0-x86_64-linode54
<codebam>	yea
<sheep>	celti: but does uname -r match what's in /usr/lib/modules?
<celti>	there are no modules
<codebam>	well i'll be back if the i686 doesnt boot. if not then i'll be back a bit later
<sheep>	oh
<celti>	linode does monolithic kernels
<sheep>	you mean static kernels
<sheep>	that's weird
<sudokode>	celti: that doesn't mean what you think it means
<noremi>	codebam, report on how well it works for you
<sheep>	maybe something got screwed up with their kernel config
<celti>	i guess i'll try downgrading it.
<celti>	sudokode: if the word has some special meaning to kernel hackers then i apologise. i'm a writer, not a kernel hacker.
<sudokode>	well.. not really...
<celti>	i was using it in the dictionary meaning of "constituting or acting as a single, often rigid, uniform whole"
<sheep>	'monolithic' means everything is contained in a single address space in kernel mode
<celti>	i.e., in opposition to modular
<sheep>	monolithic kernels are usually modular
<darkhalo>	anybody have an idea as to why adobe flash would not  be putting out any sound? i've updated everything :(
<sudokode>	it's just that when you're talking about kernel design, a monolithic kernel is the opposite of a microkernel
<celti>	darkhalo: pulseaudio?
<sudokode>	so saying a monolithic linux kernel is redundant in that sense :s
<crendel>	has anyone had issues with packer falling into an infinite loop when upgrading packages from aur? it installs and then wants to reinstall the same versions again and again until i quit the script manually, then it's fine
<celti>	darkhalo: if you're using pulse, check and make sure flash didn't get it's volume turned down while the rest of the system is turned up.
<crendel>	and typing "n" at the "do you want to continue installing" prompt does nothing, it just keeps going; have to alt-c it
<darkhalo>	celti, i'll check it :)
<sudokode>	monolithic means the kernel exists entirely in kernel space, whereas a microkernel is nearly the complete opposite where the kernel space contains a small core of the kernel and the rest is provided a userspace servers
<sudokode>	          as &
<sudokode>	               ^ ^
<sudokode>	jesus my typos
<wheatthins>	i'm attempting to get skype audio to work
<celti>	so it does have a special meaning i was unaware of. i'll remember that for the future.
<sheep>	a hybrid kernel is a combination of thw two
<sudokode>	wheatthins: are you on x86_64?
<wheatthins>	sudokode, 64bit
<sudokode>	right, that's the 64-bit one
<wheatthins>	i tried installing apulse from aur and launching skype with apulse skype but still have no audio
<sudokode>	did you enable multilib?
<wheatthins>	sudokode, yes
<sudokode>	hm
<darkhalo>	celti, how do i view the different volume settins for each process?
<sudokode>	celti: yes essentially
<sudokode>	even though i knew what you meant anyway :p

<codebam>	noremi: it booted :)
<noremi>	and everything works? network too?
<codebam>	okay, so how can i know if my wifi usb is working?
<codebam>	cause wifi-menu brings up a help
<noremi>	with the red warning?
<wheatthins>	sudokode, according to a forum post on bbs.archlinux.org i need lib32-apulse-git if i'm on 64bit
<wheatthins>	it's asking me if i want to replace gcc with gcc-multilib
<sudokode>	that's odd
<codebam>	yea a :( face
<sudokode>	yes, you do
<wheatthins>	ok
<sudokode>	just install multilib-devel while you're at it
<sudokode>	makes everything that much easier
<noremi>	codebam i had the same thing :( and xorg didn't let me use mouse/keyboard
<wheatthins>	got it
<sudokode>	multilib-devel just provides stuff that replaces stuff in base-devel so you can build 32-bit stuff for 64-bit system
<codebam>	noremi: xorg? this is the install iso
<sudokode>	s
<wheatthins>	sudokode, interestingly enough it still doesn't have audio when i relaunch with apulse skype
<noremi>	codebam, oh, i tried running xorg, but also had the red warning with wifi-menu
<noremi>	wheatthins, apulse32 skype
<noremi>	for 64-bit
<wheatthins>	that did it, thanks
<wheatthins>	norcuron,
<wheatthins>	noremi,  *
<codebam>	okay, well can i connect to wifi?
<wheatthins>	sorry, highlighted the wrong person
<codebam>	how did you fix it?
<noremi>	codebam: i was unable to fix it, had to downgrade
<noremi>	up until now, i have not found a solution here
<sheep>	noremi, codebam: what model wireless card are you using?
<wheatthins>	noremi, mic isn't working still though
<noremi>	wheatthins: did you test using echo test service?
<wheatthins>	yes
<codebam>	sheep: ralink 50xx something
<codebam>	it needs the firmware-ralink
<noremi>	check skype>options>sound devices>mic
<wheatthins>	noremi, only device is pulseaudioserver (local)
<sheep>	codebam: is linux-firmware installed?
<wheatthins>	pulseaudio server (local) *
<codebam>	sheep: its the install usb
<noremi>	wheatthins: that should be fine, does mic work elsewhere? try running alsamixer and unmuting
<sheep>	codebam: does pacman -q linux-firmware show anything?
<codebam>	yea its installed, but the database files don't exist cause it's the install iso
<wheatthins>	noremi, it's a usb mic
<codebam>	20150206
<wheatthins>	but i don't see where it is in alsamixer
<wheatthins>	tried all the muted channels
<noremi>	run alsamixer, then press f4 and see if capture is shown
<noremi>	you may need to f6 and select the usb mic
<celti>	aha, found the issue! systemd-networkd disabled forwarding on eth0

<wheatthins>	heres the sound devices
<codebam>	sheep: what do you mean? what don't you understand
<noremi>	is pch your default?
<wheatthins>	noremi, i'm not sure
<wheatthins>	i've never actually configured this part by hand

<sheep>	codebam: the entire thing.
<wheatthins>	ak5370 should be the usb mic actually
<wheatthins>	now that i remember
<wheatthins>	which is set to 52
<sheep>	codebam: i don't know where you'd be able to get the firmware you need.  i don't use ralink devices
<noremi>	i don't think the usb mic is the default input, that's why
<codebam>	sheep: it was in official packages for debian
<codebam>	firmware-ralink
<sheep>	codebam: arch has different packaging

<wheatthins>	noremi, after messing with .asoundrc and yelling really loudly into my mic i can hear myself very, very faintly with arecord/aplay
<wheatthins>	under lots of static
<noremi>	wheatthins: heh, i am imagining this. so something is working
<noremi>	the wiki has a section regarding crackling mics
<wheatthins>	i did mess with tons of input volume settings
<wheatthins>	not really knowing what the mixer bars should be set to

<rena>	huh, yaourt complains when run as root, but doesn't it have to be root to install things to /usr?
<sheep>	rena: it will call sudo to do that
<d_garbage>	you should probably stop using yaourt
<rena>	ahh
<rena>	why?
<d_garbage>	because you're trying to run it as root
<ldionmarcil>	hi. i just found an outdated pkgbuild on the aur. what is the best practice to update this pkgbuild? should i just leave a comment stating so?
<rena>	>.>
<rena>	well now i know
<d_garbage>	i'd stick to makepkg and something like cower until you know what you're doing (and probably after that too)
<rena>	well how am i gonna learn if not by doing :p
<wheatthins>	noremi, any idea?
<noremi>	wheatthins: okay, i don't know anymore, try editing your ~/.asoundrc file as described here https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/advanced_linux_sound_architecture/troubleshooting#setting_the_default_microphone.2fcapture_device

<wheatthins>	noremi, i mad ethat .asoundrc file edit awhile back
<sudokode>	rena: what you're doing is `yaourt -s foo` not `cower -dd foo; cd foo; vim pkgbuild; makepkg -si`
<wheatthins>	complete with usb device id
<sudokode>	so you're not really learning anything
<noremi>	wheatthins: hope you'll find the magic config
<rena>	well i had been building them that way but this is more convenient
<sudokode>	that's fine. as long as you don't ask us why something is broken
<sudokode>	since that sort of tool is unsupported
<rena>	heh
<sudokode>	it's sort of like mpd. if you write a client for mpd, mpd isn't responsible for the client breaking
<sudokode>	it could be an mpd bug, but you should start with the client since it has to work with mpd properly to work at all
<wheatthins>	sudokode, do you know anything more about usb mic input?
<d_garbage>	you could at least read man yourt
<rena>	...fair point
<wheatthins>	i've tried the instructions on various wiki links
<d_garbage>	yaourt*
<sudokode>	wheatthins: "more" ?
<sudokode>	wheatthins: did i ever say anything about them to begin with?
<rena>	i usually do like to try to fix things myself
<wheatthins>	sudokode, perhaps i was mistaken, i think you may have highlighted me earlier up in the problem solving>?
<wheatthins>	upon checking, with regards to apulse/apulse32
<sudokode>	rena: that's actually a terrible example
<sudokode>	why didn't you call me an idiot
<rena>	i was being polite ;)
<wheatthins>	"more" as in beyond what noremi or myself have tried
<sudokode>	a better example would be if you take a frontend program and make a wrapper for it, which is exactly what yaourt does
<sudokode>	two tools actually... pacman and makepkg
<d_garbage>	the only situation i can think of where you might want to use yaourt is if a package has lots of aur deps but personally i avoid packages like that anyway so *shrug*
<sudokode>	whereas arch develops those tools with the express purpose of them being used by end users
<ldk>	pacaur is pretty great, i'm surprised it isn't more popular. i never cared for yaourt either
<sudokode>	so when you write wrappers for them, you're going outside of how those tools were intended to be used
<sudokode>	which breaks your warranty as expected
<rena>	...i had a warranty? :p
<ldk>	haha
<sudokode>	rena: sure. you can come here, go to the bbs, file bugs...
<sudokode>	if you weren't on arch, we'd tell you to piss off
<rena>	heh
<sudokode>	sort of a warranty of support?
<ldk>	sudokode: but how do i install apt-get without apt-get already installed! arch is rubbish!
<crendel>	packer
<sudokode>	ldk: curl https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ap/apt/apt.tar.gz | tar -xf && cd apt; vim pkgbuild; makepkg -si
<wheatthins>	noremi, mic works in audacity
<sudokode>	tar -xf - **
<ldk>	sudokode: does my warranty cover this?
<sudokode>	ldk: nope
<ldk>	hehe
<sudokode>	but you can yell at the maintainer ^
<sudokode>	oh there is no maintainer
<sudokode>	shocking
<ldk>	probably for that very reason
<selby>	 /me uses yaourt
<selby>	dammit
<ldk>	someone got mad at me today for not documenting an open-source project i released up to his standards
<ldk>	the nerve
<wheatthins>	i have the mic working now, how do i set my mic (ak5370) to be ddefault instead of sound card 2 in alsa

<jdahm>	sudokode: i've never gotten the keyboard bindings to work
<jdahm>	maybe because i've spent nearly no time investigating why...
<sudokode>	wat
<jdahm>	i think my window manager (mutter) is screwing with things
<sudokode>	could be if it uses the same binding
<lyonsb>	maybe i don't understand the problem?  but what's wrong with gnome-terminal?
<jdahm>	lyonsb: i can't find the config file to sync to another computer. pita to set-up every time
<lyonsb>	jdahm, what is it about your config that cannot be put into .bashrc?

<lyonsb>	or .dashrc or ?
<crazedpsyc>	colors? font? all the graphical stuff?
<jdahm>	lyonsb: yeah the colors and font and such
<lyonsb>	jdahm, gosh it's a bit archiac, i haven't dug around to find color=true in a terminal config file in years.
<lyonsb>	jdahm, i mean, my memory is archaic.
<lyonsb>	jdahm, or of using a semi-archaic system.
<sudokode>	i can tell you how to find it
<sudokode>	you use find
<lyonsb>	sudokode, if i look, it'
<lyonsb>	sudokode, i'll probl. try to golf through it with vim
<sudokode>	not you
<lyonsb>	in /etc/skel files.
<lyonsb>	indeed, not me.
<lyonsb>	my bad.
<sudokode>	sometimes i have to say things without people's nicks otherwise it seems like i'm purposefully trying to insult them
<sudokode>	which sometimes i am, but one must display certain etiquette
<lyonsb>	if you're going to insult someone, you should probably do it with style :)
<sudokode>	sometimes i just can't find the motivation
<sudokode>	i should see a therapist
<crazedpsyc>	just go with a cartman style exit
<jdahm>	sudokode: it's not just a file with gnome-terminal. i'll go back to termite for now
<sudokode>	fuck yall, i'm going $home
<deathspawn>	how do i install smokeping without gui dependency hell (it's on a server.)
<crazedpsyc>	oh right, it's gnome's cute little registry
<sudokode>	deathspawn: build it without x deps?
<lyonsb>	gnome-dorg-config-wtf?
<sudokode>	lets start with what smokeping is and where you're installing it from
<deathspawn>	yea i forgot about the compile flags route
<sudokode>	pretty much the only route
<sudokode>	besides just installing x
<deathspawn>	it was going to install wayland
<sudokode>	wayland has a lot less bloat than x
<selby>	everyone's all about wayland these days
<deathspawn>	stumped me though at the gl selection...
<selby>	hippies
<noremi>	is wayland stable enough?
<sudokode>	deathspawn: pick anything. it wouldn't matter
<sudokode>	the only problem you'd face is a loss of space on the server... not much... but still
<crazedpsyc>	wayland is stable. the protocol just doesn't support much
<sudokode>	my guess is if smokeping comes with a command line tool, you could still use it just fine
<deathspawn>	and redundant things running
<sudokode>	if smokeping only has a gui, then you can't use it anyway
<deathspawn>	well idk if things would run without a graphics card
<crazedpsyc>	wayland isn't going to make things run, it's just a library
<sudokode>	you wouldn't be running anything
<sudokode>	assuming you're after a command line program that smokeping provides, you'd never run x
<sudokode>	or wayland
<sudokode>	it's like gvim
<noremi>	isn't wayland supposed to replace x?
<sudokode>	you can install gvim but still use vim outside of x
<sudokode>	noremi: it's a proposed replacement... will it ever? probably not
<lyonsb>	noremi, i wouldn't count on it within this decade.
<crazedpsyc>	at least all the major graphics toolkits support it
<coolthingy500>	doesn't ubuntu have wayland running on top of xorg in some matter. i forget what's it's called.
<lyonsb>	the point is not to replace x: yet
<deathspawn>	i think switching from x to wayland is the challenge more than supporting wayland
<sudokode>	eventually x will just fade out of common use as wayland becomes more usable and also gains competition from mir and other projects that will pop up
<crazedpsyc>	it just doesn't have cool snazzy features like minimizing windows yet
<azurex>	?
<dexter>	coolthingy500: mir
<sudokode>	but x will never be replaced by wayland. that's just discounting the work done outside of wayland
<sudokode>	such as mir ^
<crazedpsyc>	fedora is switching to wayland in the next release
<electricprism>	is there a way to have cd or a similar cli autocorrect for uppercase lowercase? eg: cd /portal/profiles/me will be entered when you write lowercase cd /portal/profiles/me
<crazedpsyc>	xwayland (wayland clients in x) is decent.
<sudokode>	releases are where you'll see the most replacement of x with wayland (or something else)
<dexter>	electricprism: i think zsh does that but i'm not sure
<crazedpsyc>	it does indeed
<sudokode>	because distros that provide releases like fedora or debian or ubuntu have to pick something
<sudokode>	and they will go with the simpler choice for them, which is wayland
<sudokode>	or whatever else
<electricprism>	dexter: thanks i'll research it, it seems to intuitive option as i often use uppercase for personal folder declarations
<sudokode>	x is never the simpler choice
<sudokode>	it's just the more common choice at this point
<lyonsb>	(there are graphs in which x is the simpler choice, just sayin :)
<coolthingy500>	kinda like systemd.
<dexter>	systemd is horrible o_o
<sudokode>	compared to what?
<dexter>	anything
<sudokode>	that seems unfair
<crazedpsyc>	hey, that's not the cool opinion anymore
<dexter>	a sack of dog crap can boot a linux system better than systemd
<dexter>	watch, i'll show you
<lyonsb>	i'd love to see a picture of you doing exactly that . . .
<coolthingy500>	all systemd has done is replaced small problems and made itself into a monlithic kind of mess.
<sudokode>	if you'd like to gather some empirical evidence, i can provide some samples
<dexter>	i like old style init systems. :(
<coolthingy500>	other then that though. i got systemd to stop filling my log files to huge gb space.
<dexter>	like openrc
<crazedpsyc>	i haven't seen anyone argue that x is superior to wayland yet though
<sudokode>	dexter: openrc is rather complex and slow
<crazedpsyc>	x is the monolithic pile of shit that was abandoned by its own developers for being a monolithic pile of shit
<deathspawn>	it's superior because i use it! (actually it's not.)
<coolthingy500>	it more or less works.
<dexter>	sudokode: systemd is ultra complex
<sudokode>	no it's not...
<dexter>	enable the cupsd service for me
<dexter>	give me the command for that
<jdahm>	i really like systemd. but what i do know...
<gendale_>	so i have a weird question: is it possible to netinstall arch using the terminal on the mac os x system recovery partition?
<d_garbage>	i thik the channel has had enough anti-systemd vitreol and fud over the last year or two
<crazedpsyc>	systemctl enable cupsd
<deathspawn>	as long as xfce and the rest of the stuff i use works with wayland, i'm fine with a changeover
<sudokode>	systemctl enable org.cupsd.cups.service?
<sudokode>	also, you can blame apple for that name, not systemd
<crazedpsyc>	oh my
<sudokode>	misconceptions are fun
<crazedpsyc>	i'm glad i don't print things anymore
<jdahm>	yep
<dexter>	i don't care who is to blame
<dexter>	i'm not using it
<coolthingy500>	i think the bashing of systemd has finally died down for now. well until something else comes along.
<sudokode>	ofc you don't
<azurex>	lol
<sudokode>	you'd much rather spout bullshit
<deathspawn>	3d printing > printing
<d_garbage>	yup
<sudokode>	which is fine if you're on a forum, but not here, motherfucker
<deathspawn>	i wish i had a 3d printer ;-;
<dexter>	sudokode: no, i'd much rather use what i want.
<lyonsb>	object.myobject.referencetoobjectinheriting.referencetomethodof.extendedmethodofobject.myobject()?
<dexter>	(which i do)
<sudokode>	bleh
<coolthingy500>	there is nothing stopping you in arch to use anything other then systemd
<sudokode>	i'd use runit if i didn't use systemd
<dexter>	i'm aware.
<sudokode>	but that's just me
<coolthingy500>	i got openrc on manjaro with the big ass asus machine in my room with a ssd.
<d_garbage>	lol
<lyonsb>	i think the best test case *against* systemd would consist of a robust website with tutorials and perhaps a wiki or blog on the experience of running something other than systemd and the experience of better outcomes over time.
<sudokode>	what happened to this channel...
<deathspawn>	i'm also trying to figure out why the bloody hell pulseaudio is spitting out a bind error.
<deathspawn>	e: [pulseaudio] socket-server.c: bind(): address already in use
<d_garbage>	dunno
<lyonsb>	which would require a lot of code and a real commitment.
<dexter>	sudokode: what do you mean?
<coolthingy500>	and money.
<sudokode>	openrc... manjaro...
<dexter>	dunno what manjaro is.
<sudokode>	either this channel has erupted in insanity or i'm slowly bleeding to death
<crazedpsyc>	both
<d_garbage>	tends to get like this when earnestly or mr elendig aren't around to wield the cluebat
<sudokode>	possibly
<lyonsb>	you may be insanity erupted to death.
<gendale_>	this is the support channel right? geeeeez
<gendale_>	stop arguing
<sudokode>	d_garbage: i try my best... i just can't kick people
<d_garbage>	you're too nice :p
<sudokode>	wat
<selby>	!kick sudokode
<coolthingy500>	nothing in the rule book that says i just use arch. well i don't ask manjaro help here.
<deathspawn>	hep tep rog
<sudokode>	:(
<selby>	=(
<gendale_>	for real. is there a way to bootstrap arch without usb drive or cd drive?
<dexter>	i wasn't aware there was an argument going on.
<sudokode>	i really need to watch turn
<gendale_>	using mac os x recovery terminal?
<crazedpsyc>	gendale_: if so, it's going to ridiculously hard
<gendale_>	crazedpsyc: lol
<gendale_>	i hate macs
<sudokode>	for some reason i haven't started the next episode yet
<sudokode>	fuckin youtube
<dexter>	i thought we were just having a discussion, but apparently not. :o
<sudokode>	what
<sudokode>	who's arguing
<crazedpsyc>	i wonder if macs support some kind of netboot
<coolthingy500>	who knows.
<dexter>	sudokode: ask gendale_ and dexter
<selby>	i like macs, but i've always been too poor to own them
<dexter>	er
<dexter>	d_garbage:
<crazedpsyc>	macbooks don't even have ethernet... :|
<coolthingy500>	you are not missing out on much.
<selby>	now i'm too familiar with linux to care
<sudokode>	dexter: i was referred to you by dexter
<dexter>	crazedpsyc: you can get thunderbolt -> ethernet
<gendale_>	crazedpsyc: it can netboot from the app store, lol
<dexter>	sudokode: that guy's a jerk, don't listen to him
<crazedpsyc>	gendale_: heh, not from the bios?
<sudokode>	hm
<gendale_>	but this mac is too old, and uses lion, which has been taken off the app store
<coolthingy500>	i had to work with macs. i wanted to smash the morons who issued those fu$$#@#!$ machines for work.
<gendale_>	crazedpsyc: it's uefi and some weird shitty uefi
<crazedpsyc>	ah, of course
<gendale_>	i bought this macbook for 100$ cause it didn't have an operating system
<coolthingy500>	only to be saved with win xp machines next door.
<gendale_>	but i didn't know the cd drive was broken
<gendale_>	and it's too old to usb boot
<crazedpsyc>	i'll take a public mac over a public windows machine any day, but if i own it it better have real firmware
<selby>	mac > windows
<selby>	yeah, i like having bash
<halosghost>	lolbash
<noremi>	zsh!
<selby>	go away
<halosghost>	^
<halosghost>	phrik: next
<phrik>	another satisfied customer! next!
<crazedpsyc>	osx comes with zsh!
<crazedpsyc>	hooray!
<gendale_>	they're all shitty. i bought an acer machine and the screws have literally been falling off the bottom
<halosghost>	crazedpsyc: indeed
<noremi>	crazedpsyc: it does?
<zer0rest>	fish masterrace
<crazedpsyc>	it does
<crazedpsyc>	at least recently
<selby>	i didn't know that
<noremi>	tht's cool !til
<jdahm>	sudokode: yeah that channel has really gone downhill
<jdahm>	s/that/this/
<halosghost>	zer0rest: eh; i can get fish highlighting in zsh; good enough for me
<selby>	is it me?
<coolthingy500>	i use anything over win and macs. but macs back then crashed soo much. i'm surpised i didn't get suspended for almost taking a macbook one day and throwing across the room because all of my school work became unrecoverable.
<selby>	eh, i'm going to eat
<coolthingy500>	so anytime somebody brings me a mac to fix. i tell them nicely to find someone else.
<crazedpsyc>	show them the blogpost where a macbook was fixed in an oven, stick the whole thing in an oven
<crazedpsyc>	success
<gendale_>	hahahah
<gendale_>	i'm honestly thinking my best bet at this point is to stick a screwdriver in the cd drive, close my eyes, and twist randomly
<crazedpsyc>	take it to an apple store, complain, get a new osx on it

<crazedpsyc>	that's great.
<gendale_>	also i'm pretty sure i'm sol for warranty, this thing is from like 2008
<rtmf>	...is it by any chance a slot loading mac cd drive?
<rtmf>	that's broken?
<rtmf>	b/c if so?
<rtmf>	you're sol
<coolthingy500>	the apple "geeks" wouldn't know what to do anyways.
<gendale_>	rtmf: yeah that's what i thought
<gendale_>	rtmf: i have a friend bringing me a usb cd drive but bleeeeh
<rtmf>	...at this point i'm stuck using x2go on my vps from an ancient netbook...so its complicated
<rtmf>	otoh...

<rtmf>	i was kidna just being silly dude, and i was asking/whoising b/c honestly there is someone downstairs from me by that name...no hostility intended
<rtmf>	chill out
<lyonsb>	that's confusing, because i'm really calm atm.
<rtmf>	i mean if it was busy i wouldn't, but i was just trying to eb social
<d_garbage>	moving along...
<idbentley>	i have a problem with ath9k and the 3.19 kernel.  i'm hoping to upgrade to 4.0.1 which is now in core, but don't have internet access.  i've downloaded the pkgbuild, and am transfering it to the computer with a usb key.  my question is, do i install this package as per normal?  does makepkg -i update my bootloader as pacman normally does after kern
<idbentley>	el upgrades, or do i need to manually intervent?
<d_garbage>	makepkg -i calls pacman to install as usual
<rtmf>	idbentley: one would presume its obvious from watching the output...if you are unsure, look into what package you're using to make an initrd, and beyond that the usual grub config in arch just points to vmlinuz in boot so it should be sane
<d_garbage>	it's the same as doing pacman -u
<rtmf>	ah...that too
<gendale_>	crazedpsyc: nah no thank you. lol
<gendale_>	i'm never buying another ati card again
<gendale_>	drivers are such a nightmare
<crazedpsyc>	er, there's no ati in the chimera
<crazedpsyc>	watchu talkin bout
<selby>	gendale_: yeah, i thought ati would get better after amd merger
<d_garbage>	idbentley, pacman doesn't do anything to the bootloader, btw
<selby>	i only buy nvidia now
<gendale_>	crazedpsyc: i don't know what a chimera is. google brought me some fancy ass gaming pc with a dragon

<gendale_>	ah neat
<rtmf>	oh wow, zareason's still in the game...i wish i still had the one they gave me during the beryl project...great machine till i got it all wet getting out of the shower
<crazedpsyc>	zareason is cool
<rtmf>	the "darter" i think it was, awesome little 12"? i think?
<crazedpsyc>	darter was system76 i think
<idbentley>	@d_garbage - oh, that was just an assumption.
<rtmf>	derp
<rtmf>	you're right crazedpsyc
<rtmf>	i worked with zareason later when i worked on the doomed projects for everex
<rtmf>	our little division was great but the parent company was in the process of folding >.<
<halosghost>	zareason just looks incredibly overpriced
<halosghost>	like system76
<halosghost>	handy, i guess
<halosghost>	but, definitely overpriced
<pid1>	^yup. you pay a huge premium for their hardware.
<youngwolf>	how do i change the colour of the texts on pentadactyl while using the ex commands box
<rtmf>	halosghost: its a pretty common issue with small system integrators
<pid1>	they just do the linux compatibility research for you.
<coolthingy500>	so building a machine at this point is cheaper.
<crazedpsyc>	and the customer support
<rtmf>	coolthingy500: building a machine has almost always been cheaper
<coolthingy500>	true
<halosghost>	rtmf: sure
<youngwolf>	ie: colour of the texts on the status line
<selby>	halosghost: i have a system76 laptop
<gendale_>	building a desktop is great. but finding a laptop without compatability issues is near impossible
<crazedpsyc>	i'd rather go with them for a laptop than most companies, and i certainly don't want to build a laptop myself
<selby>	it's nice
<halosghost>	selby: i don't doubt it
<halosghost>	selby: but it was overpriced
<crazedpsyc>	cheaper than alienware! \o/
<idbentley>	i'm surprised to find that the tarball here https://www.archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/linux/ doesn't contain a pkgbuild.  that seems to contradict the how to install section on the kernel wiki page: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/kernels
<phrik>	title: arch linux - linux 4.0.1-1 (x86_64) (at www.archlinux.org)
<halosghost>	crazedpsyc: lol
<selby>	yeah, but i can't build laptops
<halosghost>	selby: sounds like a personal problem
<halosghost>	:p
<selby>	whatevs
<d_garbage>	idbentley, the bootloader doesn't need to change because the kernel is always called the same thing like vmlinuz-linux or vmlinuz-linux-ck
<selby>	i wish i could
<pid1>	if you want a system76, isn't it cheaper to just buy directly from clever?
<halosghost>	pid1: probably
<crazedpsyc>	idbentley: the tarball is an installation package. if you want to build it yourself, use abs
<selby>	i'm going to go eat more rice
<noremi>	halosghost: where would you even find the frame and motherboard for a laptop?
<idbentley>	crazedpsyc, i can just point pacman at this installation package, though can't i?
<crazedpsyc>	yes
<selby>	noremi: alliexpress?
<selby>	i don't know =p
<crazedpsyc>	buy a briefcase and cut a hole in it for the case
<crazedpsyc>	true hacker style
<noremi>	heh
<coolthingy500>	makes a nice suitcase computer bomb.
<rtmf>	true hackers have a beowulf cluster botnet with voting and hot failover
<rtmf>	:-p
<coolthingy500>	but i image that you would want to stay out of jail.
<crazedpsyc>	yeah, but they need a portable thin client to control all of that
<lyonsb>	youc ould probably look at the novena laptop for an example of a diy sort of laptop.
<crazedpsyc>	now i'm trying to use my awesome keybindings in windows. <3
<lyonsb>	see how they solved the various challenges of getting a computer with specific features into a relatively small space with a monitor, altho that's also fairly electronics-lab-centric in some ways.
<rtmf>	lyonsb: i may want to look into that...still trying to figure out what laptop is going to sit on the workbench when i finally get a shop together...so far even the ee i have worked with usually just has cheapo android tablets around, too dangerous/cramped/etc. for the average laptop
<rtmf>	(which of course means things get programmed in the living room after being assembled in the lab)
<lyonsb>	i don't have one personally, i saw a talk at a confererance for a piece of the software stack for loading the fpga.
<lyonsb>	(via youtube, i was not at the conferance)
<rtmf>	ohh, its thatk ind of thing
<rtmf>	interesting
<rtmf>	...eventually i will get into fpgas...when i actually have time...
<lyonsb>	yeah, it's basically arm processor with high bandwidth bus to onboard fpga and software defined radio and stuff etc -- basically a tonne of stuff i don't know how to use with any expertise, heh.
<nixnerd>	i cannot get ncmpcpp to see my music. here is my mpd config: https://github.com/joetemp/dotfiles/blob/master/mpd.conf and my ncmpcpp config: https://github.com/joetemp/dotfiles/blob/master/config

<nixnerd>	aaron swartz did it. now he's dead.

<glyphosate>	that's like a millenia in arch time
<scimmia>	aroman, usually happens because some other software doesn't work with newer ersion
<damarusama>	the fbterm wiki page point to use gpasswd to ad a user to the video group isn't it?
<aroman>	d_garbage: that date means nothing; i'm talking about the upstream releases
<aroman>	scimmia: yeah that makes sense, but still -- why not offer both?
<aroman>	i just don't get why the newer versions aren't even packaged.
<d_garbage>	abs is there to be used
<scimmia>	aroman, unless there's a reason the newer one is needed, it's usually simpler to just keep the older one
<aroman>	yeah, building from source now. just takes forever, webkitgtk takes substantially longer to compile than the kernel lol
<scimmia>	"substantially" doesn't begin to cover it :)
<scimmia>	i build the efl port regularly, it's a few hours on a dual core haswell i7
<damarusama>	hum, just did the chmod
<sudokode>	lol
<sudokode>	"do you have a plan?"
<dacoit>	damarusama: adding yourself to video should have worked fine. remember to log out/in or `newgrp`
<sudokode>	"well, more of an interesting way of getting myself killed"
<aroman>	scimmia: damn, yeah. i want hidpi support, and the webkitgtk-hidpi packages are broken these days -- figured it'd be about the same effort to keep patching up the 2.4 version as grabbing 2.6 or 2.8 (newer stable releases)

<sudokode>	let it run. start ncmpcpp in a new terminal
<nixnerd>	still nothing dude. i even hit 'u'
<nixnerd>	wanna look at my configs?
<nixnerd>	i'm sure you really don't but i'll send them anyhow
<sudokode>	do it

<nixnerd>	my user owns it.
<aroman>	jet fuel can't melt steel beams
<rena>	can laser beams melt steel beams
<nixnerd>	beer can melt balance beams.
<nixnerd>	so can jim beam
<sudokode>	wat
<sudokode>	nixnerd: so who is joe then?
<sudokode>	your user?
<nixnerd>	sudokode: created system as joe
<sudokode>	so then who's darth?
<nixnerd>	then changed username to darth
<nixnerd>	so... my home folder is /home/joe
<nixnerd>	but my user is darth
<sudokode>	oh boy
<sudokode>	you did that wrong then
<nixnerd>	you seriously think that's the issue?
<sudokode>	possibly
<nixnerd>	sudokode: i'll just change my username back to joe then
<sudokode>	in future... usermod -l new_user -md /home/new_user
<sudokode>	well, for now...
<shanemikel>	crunchbang linux is abandoned?!?! :(
<halfwit>	i should change my user to halfwit.
<nixnerd>	sudokode: fair enough. let's change and see what happens.
<sudokode>	you could just do something like... chown -r darth:darth /home/joe ; mv /home/darth
<sudokode>	if you move it, make sure you change any configs
<sudokode>	if they're pointed at /home/joe

<sudokode>	hm
<nixnerd>	i checked arch wiki. seems as though mpd and ncmpcpp handle flac by default
<sudokode>	i dunno
<nixnerd>	let me try to change my user and see what happens
<guiburgueira>	is there any linux program that used a index for search files? like "everything for win http://www.voidtools.com/"
<keenerd>	gnome and kde both have that built in.

<supergeek800>	anyone kernel panicking upon boot after upgrading to 4.0 besides me?
<grawity>	nope, just you
<dacoit>	lol
<supergeek800>	possible reason could be that the hardware's too old for it, in which case, if i could get the kernel downgraded to a previous version to get it bootable again, and then switch to the lts kernel after that.
<grawity>	...what does the kernel panic message actually say?
<scimmia>	supergeek800, -ck kernel, by any chance?
<crazedpsyc>	can you boot a live cd/usb to arch-chroot in and downgrade?
<supergeek800>	saying not enough room on the boot partition (3mb boot, 6gb swap, the rest is home, probably a bad idea, even though i got basically no ram on this thing).
<supergeek800>	likely doing something wrong.
<dacoit>	wait what?
<score_under>	3mb boot, that's tiny
<dacoit>	the kernel is like 4m
<scimmia>	not to mention the initramfs
<score_under>	and the initramfs, and the fallback initramfs :p
<dacoit>	which are the bulk
<dacoit>	3mb is a typo i'm guessing
<supergeek800>	so i'm fucked and gotta kill off the whole partition and start all over, which means i lose 10gb worth of music that took me weeks to download, unless there's a way to fix it.
<dacoit>	you're fucked if your data is corrupted. is it? you've given like no useful info yet
<scimmia>	supergeek800, wow, you give up easily
<supergeek800>	may see if i can't somehow access boot records on the drive (using an old lubuntu livecd atm).
<crazedpsyc>	if you're using a livecd, you should be able to access all of your data
<dacoit>	that shouldnt affect the data elsewhere
<crazedpsyc>	and you should be able to resize the boot partition
<crazedpsyc>	and chroot in and reinstall the kernel
<crazedpsyc>	so basically nothing fucked at all
<dacoit>	first find out the real size of all your partitions. you havent even mentioned / yet
<jack_rabbit>	supergeek800, backup your data before you do anything else, if you care about it at all.
<scimmia>	wait, he's supposed to have a / partition?
<jack_rabbit>	supergeek800, but a non-booting kernel shouldn't mean your data is gone.
<jack_rabbit>	*necessarily*
<crazedpsyc>	certainly doesn't mean that, but everything might *coincidentally* be fucked :p
<jack_rabbit>	could be... but not particularly likely.
<crazedpsyc>	indeed
<supergeek800>	i'mma try resizing the boot partition to 50mb, see if that helps, hopefully.
<guiburgueira>	scimmia, the /media and /var/run should be the my external disks by default, right?
<guiburgueira>	i'm trying to excluse them of prunepaths
<supergeek800>	if successful, /boot will be 50mb, / will be about 50gb, and i'll have a new 20gb partition.
<supergeek800>	i hope to hell this works, and i might as well be as dumb as the manjaro guys. -embarrassed-
<guiburgueira>	supergeek800, i guess it will work
<supergeek800>	although being generally an arch newb that hasn't dealt with this kinda thing before doesn't necessarily put me on the same level as manjaro users, i guess.
<electricprism>	does anyone know what this error could mean? error while loading shared libraries: libvpx.so.1: cannot open shared object file: no such file or directory
<supergeek800>	still dumb as fuck though.
<electricprism>	might wanna backup the boot sector idk
<electricprism>	mbr
<scimmia>	guiburgueira, i have no idea what you're talking about
<scimmia>	electricprism, it means you need to either install the missing library or rebuild the program if it's linked to an old version
<electricprism>	scimmia: i see, the error is from the aur app 4kyoutubetomp3. would i need to reinstall ffmpeg-compat
<supergeek800>	if this don't work, i'mma be pissed, yet on the other hand, got a 20gb partition to back up my music to just in case.
<scimmia>	electricprism, unless you did a partial update, repo packages should not be a problem
<xyzaffa1r>	what is your guys preferred bittorent client? anything wrong with just going with transmission?
<dacoit>	nope
<supergeek800>	i prefer to use usenet or direct-download when i can.
<electricprism>	xyzaffa1r: i use transmission, but be sure to require encryption to all peers as that setting isn't by default on
<xyzaffa1r>	electricprism, i will do that, been using it for quite some time with out doing that.
<xyzaffa1r>	probably a good idea.
<electricprism>	if your isp sniffs your traffic like most do they'll have their fingers into your business
<electricprism>	scimmia: i tried reinstalling via $sudo pacman -s ffmpeg-compat     am i doing it wrong that you can see, thanks bro
<electricprism>	supergeek800: what happened to your partition? i've had many data loss/recovery experiences on linux
<xyzaffa1r>	electricprism, never had problems with that, all though the number they have no longer exists and who checks male :)
<xyzaffa1r>	mail*
<scimmia>	electricprism, just do a pacman -syu. if the problem doesn't go away, you need to figure out what aur programs you have that are linked to the old lib.
<xyzaffa1r>	just set it to "require permission"
<xyzaffa1r>	?
<electricprism>	schimmia: alright cool ty
<electricprism>	sec
<electricprism>	yes
<electricprism>	also
<electricprism>	under the network tab "pick a random port every time transmission starts"
<electricprism>	.02
<xyzaffa1r>	what is the .02?
<xyzaffa1r>	oops, i mean "require encryption"
<electricprism>	two cents, meaning my opinion or a slight suggestion
<xyzaffa1r>	oh, ok.
<xyzaffa1r>	thank you.
<xyzaffa1r>	can i some how set it to not ever seed? i feel like being cancer.
<electricprism>	yes
<electricprism>	upload limit 1kb or 0kb i think
<electricprism>	although some trackers will be less generous the more you take to prioritize you if i understand it correctly
<xyzaffa1r>	what do you mean?
<supergeek800>	iirc, if it don't boot after a repartitioning, that pointing the / partition to whatever the main partition is will fix it, provided you added a new partiton to begin with.
<rena>	i think that's not even the trackers but the clients themselves will prefer to interact with peers who reciprocate
<electricprism>	rarely do i see it, but i dont seed sometimes and my download speed gets throttled down some, in the past it seemed like because i wasn't sharing
<swedftp>	is there a depends_i686=() like there is for _x86_64?
<supergeek800>	like, say, if / is on /dev/sda3 now as a result of the new partition being on /dev/sda2.
<swedftp>	and is there optdepends_architecture()?
<electricprism>	yeah, what @rena said - i'm kindof noobish to torrent
<supergeek800>	electricprism: i'm noobish to troubleshooting a non-booting system in general.
<electricprism>	hm
<dacoit>
<electricprism>	supergeek800 - what filesystem do you use on your partitions?
<supergeek800>	ext4.
<electricprism>	well thats good, at least grub natively can read it
<swedftp>	and do the depends for that ovverride depends=() or do those still apply in addition to the architecture specific depends
<junka>	my firewall blocks incoming connections too often, is that normal or weird?
<agregory>	swedftp: man pkgbuild
<electricprism>	the mbr is at the beginning of the disk like a index to a book
<supergeek800>	standard fs, running an 80gb hdd, f2fs won't benefit me at all.
<electricprism>	if the mbr is damaged or has incorrect information about the partitions the information won't be readable
<dacoit>	not in the slightest..
<supergeek800>	so sticking with the standard ext4 fs.
<swedftp>	agregory, ahh i was on the wiki, it seems more generally worded here as they present it as an example, thanks, i should have checked this.
<electricprism>	you can rebuild a bad mbr using a utility called diskpatch3 if the disk type is msdos and not gpt
<electricprism>	 supergeek800 - are you using grub2?
<supergeek800>	should be using whatever the latest grub that arch has is.
<swedftp>	actually it's worded the same in the wiki, i just didn't completely understand it.
<electricprism>	supergeek800: if you can get to grub resuce try $ls (hd0,msdos1)/
<electricprism>	and cycle through hd #s and msdos# parition #s to see whats readable i would guess
<electricprism>	it should be able to list some contents
<supergeek800>	i may lose sleep, this is going to take for goddamn ever.
<xyzaffa1r>	well thanks electricprism, i am going to go for now.
<tick_t0ck_time>	lesson to the wise: backup frequenty. if you put in the time to download 10gb music, make sure you have more than one copy.
<electricprism>	zyxaffair: goodnight :) glad to help
<electricprism>	yup, and also a raid1 isn't considered a backup
<dacoit>	swedftp: do/did you host opennic dns servers?
<electricprism>	man, banshee crashes and so does rhythmbox, anyone know any music players that are decent
<electricprism>	i use gnome
<phreakachu>	spotify
<pandb>	is there a way to know which tty a is active for a given user?
<swedftp>	dacoit, yes i do.
<swedftp>	infact
<swedftp>	i believe two of mine are listed on the arch wiki
<pandb>	a command like `get_tty pandb`
<pandb>	and it returns something like tty3
<pandb>	?
<electricprism>	supergeek800 - have you considered reinstalling grub to the boot parition and overwriting the boot data?
<swedftp>	coincidentally, i noticed when looking at the dns config page
<electricprism>	supergeek800 - i know in some cases my linux kernel image has gone bad and so i need to both rebuild initcpio and i've even reinstalled grub when cloning a arch hdd to a new hdd
<dacoit>	swedftp: i thought i knew that name from somewhere, i live in il. 'preciate it o/
<electricprism>	supergeek800: from arch live i would run $ grub-install --recheck /dev/sdx#
<dacoit>	pandb: w
<supergeek800>	the new partition is going to be on ext4, so shouldn't have to worry too, too much about it not booting after the kernel downgrade, which hopefully will be successful as i'll be using a 50mb boot partition.
<supergeek800>	oh, disregard!
<electricprism>	oh i see you're concocting some kind of solution to rescue the other paritions
<supergeek800>	just enlarging the boot and adding a new 20gb for backup purposes.
<supergeek800>	which resulted in a resize of / to 50gb.
<electricprism>	sometimes gparted disk resizing has given me issues, i usually run gdisk or fdisk to check the partition geometry afterwards
<jushur>	why dont rxvt-unicode in arch honor the urxvt*.iconfile: setting in ~./xresources ?
<swedftp>	dacoit, ahh, same, joliet area. i'm actually quite glad to hear from someone who uses it & that it's actually used for things other than amplification attacks, mostly joking! but seriously, i'm glad to hear that. \o
<dacoit>	swedftp: haha damn blackhats making egalitarian anti-censorship dns uncool. i'm up by barrington. do you just run a couple of vps's as a side project?
<supergeek800>	37 min remaining, and it's about time for me to hit the sack, chriiiiiiist..
<swedftp>	dacoit, mostly, had the geographically distributed vps's, & figured it would only help to contribute a negligible amount of bandwidth to support the idea of opennic, while still utilizing them & the geographically distributed redundancy.
<supergeek800>	also, i assume i could just move the new partition to /dev/sda4 as well.
<supergeek800>	32min remaining for the / resize.
<swedftp>	i had hosted my own domain's ns for awhile, and allowing resolution for opennic domains seemed the right thing to do, granted most of the vm's are hardly stressed.
<swedftp>	ns's
<dacoit>	i see, very cool of you. i have 1 which is kind of in limbo between projects that ihost things like an ntp public-pool server on and software mirrors. thinking about repurposing it similarly
<supergeek800>	but yeah, my plans so far are, if they work: grow the boot partition from 3mb to 50mb, shrink the main partition from 60gb to 55gb, add a new 20gb partition, downgrade to a previous kernel, and then switch to lts from there.
<supergeek800>	my hardware is about eight years old, so it may or may not support 4.0.
<scimmia>	supergeek800, when you say boot partition, are you talking about a grub partition?
<supergeek800>	yes, since that's the bootloader i use.
<scimmia>	they're two very different hings
<scimmia>	things
<tekken>	wee
<supergeek800>	oh my fuck, still 24min to go, i'mma have a hellish day staying up tomorrow/
<tekken>	supergeek800: you could just go to sleep.
<tekken>	:)
<scimmia>	supergeek800, there's no way a 3mb boot partition ever worked, at least not in the last 10 years. if you're talking about a grub partition, the size doesn't really matter
<phreakachu>	grub partition is called "bios boot" in partition managers
<dacoit>	ef02
<supergeek800>	19min remaining, starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel for this step.
<tekken>	supergeek800: just go to bed
<tekken>	it'll be fine
<supergeek800>	surprised something hasn't broken on this archaic fuck yet.
<supergeek800>	really?
<tekken>	you're welcome.
<supergeek800>	but yeah, this thing is *ancient* and *sloooooow*
<tekken>	supergeek800: not a thank you or anything?
<tekken>	i'm offended.
<tekken>	:|
<supergeek800>	thanks!
<tekken>	yay!
<tekken>	its okay.... everyone has the thing.
<supergeek800>	anyways, 1.8ghz sempron 3400+, 1.5gb ram, 80gb hard drive that was pre-fail last time i did a smart check.
<tekken>	supergeek800: that sounds modern.
<swedftp>	dacoit, i'd definitely consider it if you have the idle resources, and care to get familiar with dns at any level, i've not had many issues, besides making sure it's available as much as possible. i would however recommend that if you host anything critical on the vps just be mindful of the potential abuse complaints & null routing(shouldn't happen if you rate limit & take precautions.)due to amplification attacks. assuming you don't have a
<swedftp>	provider worth their salt, especially regarding support, as i don't, granted they are reasonably priced...
<smirky>	does anybody have experience with handling domains outside ascii standards, i.e. домейн.com etc... i'm trying to get some answers on specific things, such as how do you define it in a zone file, can it have subdomains and if yes, how do you define them also.
<tekken>	wth
<supergeek800>	it's from '06, that's almost ten years old.
<tekken>	10 years is a long freakin time in computer years
<tekken>	they ain't like cars.
<tekken>	and what just happened....
<tekken>	did a bunch of people come in and blow up the channel?
<supergeek800>	once i'm able to, wanna try a nice soc system for upgrading.
<supergeek800>	(whatever intel or amd has out for that at the time)
<tekken>	soc?
<tekken>	ah
<supergeek800>	embedded, can get a decent-performing quad-core on the uber-cheap that way, and it's be quick to put together.
<supergeek800>	it'd
<tekken>	as of tomorrow i'll be using an amd fx-6300
<tekken>	which makes me happy.
<supergeek800>	the chip that is too big for its own good, lol.
<tekken>	supergeek800: yea, that one.
<supergeek800>	that's fx' problem, unfortunately.
<tekken>	supergeek800: it'd probably help also if the motherboard quality for amd processors wasn't complete shit.
<tekken>	lol.
<supergeek800>	too big and power-hungry for its own good, while the intel equivalent is a bit quicker and more efficient.
<electricprism>	i was really interested in amd hsa, i hope to see arm mature this next decade
<gehidore>	640k ram ftw
<tekken>	gehidore: that's really modern.
<electricprism>	48k should be enough for anyone
<tekken>	i bet that could run skyrim even.
<supergeek800>	electricprism: there has to be a demand for arm first.
<dacoit>	swedftp: yeah you're spot on, i'd use it to get more familiar with dns. and opennic has their own wonky dns ecosystem too. i think i'll try to have one providing dnscrypt eventually. but yeah, until i find a proper setup and have some resources to commit indefinitely it'll be a bit of a toy project
<supergeek800>	electricprism: i mean past phones and stuff.
<gehidore>	electricprism: +1
<gehidore>	iirc it's 8mhz
<tekken>	so i'm having trouble consuming enough calories now that i started riding my bike to and from work.
<tekken>	i'm just plain not hungry exercising that much.
<tekken>	any ideas?
<gehidore>	eat more fish
<gehidore>	stop being a vegan
<supergeek800>	for example, even with the rasppi-compatible version of win10 ms will be offering, there's still jack shit available for that platform, which, it being the most widely-used platform at least for the pc market..
<tekken>	gehidore: fish is my favorite food.
<tekken>	but its pricey.
<electricprism>	supergeek800: beyond hobby market? yeah. i'm not sure i can put arm to highly valuable purpose at this time without inventing some new tech, rasberry pi 2 looks interesting at least - maybe it'd make a good mail and dns server or something
<gehidore>	and knock of the protein bars and powders
<dacoit>	and whey
<tekken>	i've not used any of that.
<electricprism>	ew windows 10 arm, that sounds as bad as windows mellenium edition
<dacoit>	- said every cyclist ever
<tekken>	i can't seem to find healthy foods.
<gehidore>	knock off*
<gehidore>	tekken: they're pretty prevalent at the supermarket
<tekken>	gehidore: but all i got is my bike..... its hard to move a lot of food at once. d:
<gehidore>	backpack
<gehidore>	satchel
<gehidore>	purse
<dacoit>	mres
<tekken>	those cost money.
<gehidore>	saddle bags on yer bike
<tekken>	i'm a tightwad with money.
<tekken>	i squeeze poop out of nickels.
<gehidore>	you should ea tthat
<gehidore>	full of protein
<electricprism>	supergeek800 - good for you, our windows me pacbell from 1998 was a nightmare, we bsod' literally twice a day, yeah old windows 98 and dos games were the best - the golden age of indie computer gaming
<supergeek800>	but yeah, considering how much of a market flop winrt was, with the rasppi port of win10 being the basic equivalent of that, dunno on that end.
<tekken>	gehidore: lol.
<tekken>	i barely caught what you said.
<tekken>	:x
<gehidore>	strange meh dns went crazy on the remote box for a while for no good reason
<gehidore>	:d
<tekken>	i only have two dns records
<tekken>	gobash.ninja
<tekken>	and gobash.me
<tekken>	i guess that's domains
<tekken>	but w/e
<supergeek800>	oh thank fuck, 3min remaining, hope to hell this works.
<gehidore>	this was outgoing dns randomly couldn't resolve domains but if i accessed them by ip it would resolve next attempt by fqdn
<tekken>	gehidore: that's highly odd behavior.
<tekken>	gehidore: i'm still secretly hoping it blows up on him.
<tekken>	>.>
<electricprism>	this is a unix system! i know this
<dacoit>	program the gui in visual basic!
<gehidore>	electricprism: is it really unix?

<gehidore>	or is it gnu!!!
<supergeek800>	(hurd, which is dead)
<gehidore>	damn i'm tired... but i haven't even begun this migration and it _has_ to be done by 8am edt
<dacoit>	the hurd isnt dead

<electricprism>	gehidore: i run hurt on a commedore 64 so there ya go
<supergeek800>	dacoit: it hardly got off the ground, and you can't really do anything with it.
<electricprism>	hurd? whats the point
<gehidore>	i've still got a commodore 64 somewhere
<tekken>	i've still not came up with something useful to do with my vps..... ideas would be helpful?
<tekken>	anyone wanna pay me a dollar a month for some space?
<tekken>	^_^
<dacoit>	supergeek800: it's a long ways off, with work to be done, thats not really a strike against it.
<gehidore>	tekken: thanks but no
<tekken>	gehidore: awe, why not?
<thurstylark>	i'm having trouble running minecraft on this fresh install. it won't launch, and the error report says something about lwjgl, but i can't find any useful info on my own. would anyone be able to help me out?
<tekken>	thurstylark: did you install your graphics driver?
<gehidore>	tekken: cause i've got teh free vps... runnig the arch
<tekken>	it kinda gets angry if you don't do that.
<tekken>	gehidore: where is this?
<gehidore>	i suppose now that 4.0 is stable i can stop playing with mainline afterall
<gehidore>	digital ocean
<dacoit>	4.0.1-1 even
<gehidore>	4.0.0-1-mainline
<gehidore>	hrm...
<gehidore>	yup update time i suspects
<tekken>	wow..... the linux kernel has really taken off.
<electricprism>	spotify feels like netflix - once i finally tried it it only had grade c movies, but this time with music :\
<tekken>	suppose i could build a copy..... kinda wanna wait for my pc though.
<gehidore>	course i like 4.1.0-1 on the lappy
<tekken>	electricprism: i use google music
<dacoit>	yes, undoubtedly. but 3.19 - 4 was not significant in any way
<tekken>	its decent enough.
<supergeek800>	i'm about to give the hell up.....
<gehidore>	supergeek800: sometimes you have to

<thurstylark>	tekken: will do...
<tekken>	i should've asked for that first.
<tekken>	i must be tired.
<tekken>	!peanut
<tekken>	!cookie
<phrik>	tekken wanted you to have this cookie.
<supergeek800>	oh, it's reading, that shouldn't take long.
<tekken>	hehe
<tekken>	"shouldn't"
<tekken>	what you got in that baby, an ide drive?
<tekken>	my last computer lasted from 2000 until early last year.
<tekken>	trusty little thing.
<thurstylark>	tekken: here's the full text of the crash report: http://pastie.org/10121566
<phrik>	title: #10121566 - pastie (at pastie.org)
<supergeek800>	fuck, i'll reinstall and rerip what i can if i have to.
<tekken>	thurstylark: glxinfo | grep direct
<tekken>	if it says no
<tekken>	you have a problem.
<thurstylark>	tekken: glxinfo command not fount
<thurstylark>	*found
<dacoit>	install mesa-demos
<tekken>	pacman -s mesa-libgl
<tekken>	while you're at it
<electricprism>	supergeek800 - if your partition geometry is even slightly hanky or the master boot record is slightly off the issues can come back like a haunting ghost later too just so you know :\
<thurstylark>	tekken: direct rendering: yes. also, mesa-libgl was installed
<electricprism>	also, in my experience windows actually interacts weird with ext4 when the windows disk manager tries to read the paritions
<electricprism>	once i learned windows 7 was causing damage to my ext4 i nuked windows permanently
<electricprism>	i was like wtf?
<sheep>	i've never had that issue
<electricprism>	every time i would boot into windows on a seperate hdd and reboot linux it would have to fsck
<electricprism>	ya it was a weird one
<tekken>	thurstylark: how are you running minecraft?
<electricprism>	the drive was previously raid so i'm not sure if that was part of the equation
<tekken>	like how do you launch it?
<thurstylark>	tekken: using the stock launcher as downloaded from minecraft.net: java -jar minecraft.jar
<thurstylark>	tekken: i should have mentioned this earlier: i'm using openjdk8. i have used that before without issue, but this hardware is new to me.
<tekken>	you could try using jdk7 to see if that fixes the issue.
<tekken>	did you make sure to restart x after you installed java?
<tekken>	it really doesn't like it if you don't sometimes.
<thurstylark>	yeah. i restarted the whole computer.
<thurstylark>	after i install, how do i switch to jdk7?
<tekken>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/java#switching_between_jvm
<phrik>	title: java - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<thurstylark>	no dice. still the same crash
<thurstylark>	tekken: switching to jre7 didn't work for me.
<iit_>	i am using kde+awesome, when mounting partitions in awesome it says you are not authorized but i can mount successfully those partions in kde, when mounting a dailouge appears to enter the password and i can mout it.
<jushur>	iit_: kde clearly have software to handle it, and awesome do not? what is the question?
<iit_>	jushur, the question is how to mount my other partitions ? i have total 3 hdd, i can't mount other hdd's other than the one on which arch is installed
<iit_>	gives this error -> an error occurred while accessing '1.4 tib hard drive', the system responded: an unspecified error has occurred: not authorized to perform operation
<jushur>	iit_: edit /etc/fstab maybe?
<iit_>	jushur, fstab ? no i don't think so..
<jushur>	iit_: and the other disks are they "windows formated drives" ?
<iit_>	jushur, yeah ntfs as well as ext4
<iit_>	jushur, if editing fstab was the option, then it might not work on kde as well.
<jushur>	iit_: actually if you use the drives often id advice to edit /etc/fstab
<thurstylark>	tekken: looks like i am going to have to give this one up for the night. thanks for the help!
<jushur>	iit_: so your expecting behavior from a awesome as from kde?
<iit_>	jushur, installing gvfs be an option ?
<n00balert>	anyone knows how do i apply this patch? http://git.alpinelinux.org/cgit/aports/diff/main/xen/gnutls-3.4.0.patch?id=628f27939412a7d6fb67734bd644119a1f49463a
<phrik>	title: aports - main aports tree (at git.alpinelinux.org)
<iit_>	jushur, i am using awesome wm using kde as a base..
<jushur>	iit_: setting up proper mount options is
<demize>	billybigrigger: i am not demizer, no.
<iit_>	jushur, will try that
<n00balert>	to my arch install...i read it here; https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xen/?comments=all
<phrik>	title: aur (en) - xen (at aur.archlinux.org)
<iit_>	jushur, also this seems to be a nice option https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/udisks#configuration
<phrik>	title: udisks - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<jushur>	iit_: i use /etc/fstab and /dev/disk/by-id/thediskname-partitionnumber on my machines for my personal drives
<iit_>	jushur, if possible can your post your fstab file ? so that i can get an idea.
<n00balert>	phrik: how does one apply patch to a installed library?
<sheep>	n00balert: phrik is a bot
<jushur>	iit_: note that you probably want ntfs-3g if you going to use ntfs drives.
<n00balert>	since when?
<sheep>	since phrik began existing
<n00balert>	does it exist?
<iit_>	jushur, ntfs-3g installed
<sheep>	n00balert: you need to download the original source package, use 'patch' to apply the patch, and recompile it with makepkg
<jushur>	!phrik who are you.
<jushur>	bot is not smart xd
<n00balert>	bot and smart is an oxymoron
<sheep>	n00balert: you'll probably need to change the pkgbuild
<n00balert>	sheep: hm
<iit_>	!phrik you are the biggest arch linux freak i have ever seen..!!
<iit_>	haha
<iit_>	!phrik genius
<n00balert>	sheep: if you be so kind to visit the site...i'm not even sure how do i begin to take that 'text' and apply it as a patch..! http://git.alpinelinux.org/cgit/aports/diff/main/xen/gnutls-3.4.0.patch?id=628f27939412a7d6fb67734bd644119a1f49463a
<phrik>	title: aports - main aports tree (at git.alpinelinux.org)
<sheep>	n00balert: copy it into a file called "gnutls-3.4.0.patch"
<sheep>	it's literally that easy
<n00balert>	cool
<sheep>	don't ask me what to change in the pkgbuild thoough
<n00balert>	right
<n00balert>	i'm hoping the good folks at xen aur would listen to my rant...
<sheep>	they most likely won't apply a patch that isn't from upstream
<n00balert>	right..it's alpinelinux...but it's a patch nonetheless
<sheep>	arch maintainers hate using patches that aren't from upstream
<xintron>	so, it seems that i have one process intercepting my keybinding (verified using xev) but i have no idea what it could be. is there a way to debug and see which process is intercepting my key-combination?
<tekken>	who wants to have a party?
<tekken>	ugh...
<iit_>	jushur, i modified udisk2 config file and now it works
<iit_>	which was under /usr/share/polkit-1/actions
<tekken>	need.... food
<n00balert>	tekken: good luck with that attitude :p
<tekken>	worm
<edit>	:o
<edit>	finally have weechat looking good....
<edit>	anyone here using, " st " terminal  ?
<iit_>	edit, sahre the screenshot ?
<edit>	umm,
<rtmf>	edit: never heard of, toolkit/de?
<edit>	ok
<edit>	edit: never heard of, toolkit/de?
<edit>	???
<rtmf>	also that reminds me...really want to come up with a good framebuffer terminal, may end up writing the missing features for one, they all come close
<rtmf>	edit: asking what toolkit/de the terminal is written in/for
<rtmf>	sorry
<edit>	here is what i have now
<edit>	http://i.imgur.com/yxzgirs.png
<edit>	looks much better now
<edit>	st is from, suckless.org
<edit>	dwm wm same team
<rtmf>	edit: suckless needs configuration beyond vi config.h, beyond that i love the approach
<edit>	rtmf:
<rtmf>	same problem i have re: say fbpad
<rtmf>	(or is that suckless?)
<edit>	??, you like so far ??
<iit_>	edit, my laptop 1.5 years before.. http://i.imgur.com/7izgvtd.png
<edit>	i use to use, irssi
<edit>	but liking, weechat
<rtmf>	i tried to use weechat...>.< really so used to irssi
<rtmf>	things like the way history search feels, etc.
<rtmf>	i mean maybe eventually i could get to it
<rtmf>	what i should do is make a bounty for importing an irssi config completely to weechat
<edit>	i haven't used, irssi, sense i used, slackware rtmf
<emrahnzm>	nerds.. use a de
<rtmf>	edit: slack was my first linux, ..hmm..i was 15 or 16 so...$calc(2015-16)...1999? first 8nix was sunos
<rtmf>	*nix&
<rtmf>	played with it a bit during my 1.5sem at uni before i lost the scholarship
<rtmf>	(14-15yo)
<rtmf>	that's the best thing i got out of it
<rtmf>	that and an addiction i eventually kicked to cardboard crack
<rtmf>	(and the addiction to virtual text-based realms i never have quit)
<rtmf>	...
<rtmf>	sorry ot
<iit_>	emrahnzm, no they do not :p
<saivert>	so i upgraded to 4.0 and now my server doesn't boot
<junka>	saivert; lel
<saivert>	*clap hands*
<namarrgon>	you are the winrar!
<saivert>	you ought to write some news posts about new breaking kernels
<saivert>	nothing has been writteon there since the x.org update
<saivert>	which was peanuts compared to this
<namarrgon>	how did you update to 4.0 with 4.0.1 in the repos?
<junka>	plus the funny thing is that the name 4.x.y is just for show :p
<saivert>	well current latest. all i do is pacman -syu
<junka>	it's just 3.20
<iit_>	how can i prevent my kernel from updating ?
<ioanm>	hi all!
<junka>	iit_; add kernel in ignorepkg of pacman.conf
<junka>	err, linux
<sw33tlull4by>	i just like to have a quick confirmation that this behavior is normal and if so why, so that i do not fall victim to a mit next time i see it, i connect via ssh to a server(privatekey-login) server-fingerprint is in .known_hosts, but when i use duplicity and try to access the server using duplicity /path/to/backup sftp://user@host:/path/to/dest i get a different fingerprint( i get 16bytes of hex-code) instead of the string written in .know
<junka>	rtmf; :d
<sw33tlull4by>	and i cannot find any information as to why this is
<rtmf>	junka: said linode is nic.xh/ns.xh btw, getting my own alttld ready
<rtmf>	yes that's a "reserved" cctld -- stands for horizon, as in mage: the ascension (>.>)
<saivert>	ascension island?
<iit_>	junka, will that be safe ?
<rtmf>	..no?
<iit_>	or i eill mess my system
<rtmf>	horizon, i.e. the horizon realms, is where for example concordia is
<ioanm>	rtmf: it's pacman -syyu not -syu!
<ioanm>	:)
<junka>	iit_; sure, when you wish to upgrade your kernel just comment or remove the word 'linux' from pacman.conf
<rtmf>	ioanm: its yaourt -suy tho
<saivert>	it is pacman -fu
<saivert>	as in fuck you
<rtmf>	then maybe -suyy if i wanna be crazy
<junka>	iit_; from the line ignorepkg ofc
<rtmf>	or apt-get -y dist-upgrade if i wanna break my server
<ioanm>	saivert: pls, language
<iit_>	junka, ok  :)
<rtmf>	y is an alias to "nice -n 20 yaourt"
<edit>	:/
<rtmf>	edit: you like another shell?
<edit>	besides, st ?
<n00balert>	i miss dos
<tazmain>	n00balert, why ?
<n00balert>	eh
<tazmain>	why do you mis dos ?
<n00balert>	i guess i'm old and miss simpler times
<hejki>	why would anyone miss that memory range hell? :p
<rtmf>	dos is not an operating system.  its a glorified bios.
<n00balert>	that wasn't the only bad part about it
<hejki>	yes
<hejki>	but one of the most annoying ones
<rtmf>	http://beautifulsunrise.org/evangela/tmuxirssi.jpg -- my current irssi b/c screenshots
<saivert>	ioanm: you are on #archlinux
<hejki>	at least from my pov (did game a lot on dos when i was younger)
<n00balert>	reminds me of that law...
<iit_>	junka, done :)
<hejki>	rtmf: horrid colors, wtf is wrong with console tabs (and the cursive font...), also no justification of nicks makes it garbage to read.. i think i just puked a bit in my mouth
<iit_>	but will that keep my stable if not updating kernel for couple of months ?
<hejki>	oh and too big font in general too :p
<iit_>	s/my/me
<edit>	 http://beautifulsunrise.org/evangela/tmuxirssi. │ ajacobsson
<edit>	                      | jpg
<edit>	oops
<rtmf>	hejki: ...justification of nicks takes extra space, hicks that matter are highlighted, the rest i go back and read when its time?
<edit>	srry
<junka>	iit_; \o/
<edit>	wrong command
<rtmf>	as for colors *shrugs* its not terrible but i could do to edit it by hand
<rtmf>	its got too much green
<ioanm>	saivert: ok
<rtmf>	*nicks
<ioanm>	i'm thinking about install ede
<hejki>	rtmf: the screen looks nice though :)
<ioanm>	at least it'll look like a win machine
<rtmf>	i still can't find a combination of font and fontconfig that i like
<iit_>	junka, great :) because recently i have finish installing many stuff, i don't want to break them and spend time fixing them :)
<rtmf>	(i ripped out most of infinality in the end)
<rtmf>	as for the italic font, largely a holdover from a very pink color scheme i scrapped -- those tabs are barely ever seen
<hejki>	rtmf: for some reason i love extra space (and green): http://heikki.mehtanen.fi/irssi.png
<rtmf>	in fact the kde config locally is almost never paid attention to
<rtmf>	foutrelis: i'm used to it
<foutrelis>	less is more: http://i.imgur.com/l5nzlga.png <3
<rtmf>	hejki: i remember my 80s-hacker-phase
<edit>	rtmf: a bit bright
<rtmf>	edit: yeah, its a stock color scheme
<edit>	with, color
<rtmf>	i need to edit it for 256color
<rtmf>	and/or edit the colors in konsole
<hejki>	rtmf: i just like green highlight, nothing to do with 80s, hacking or phases :p
<maty>	iit_: what keeps you from updating to the newest kernel package?
<edit>	i just got done doing for weechat
<rtmf>	i mean i guess i'm not stuck in the int0x10 palette anymoer
<rtmf>	i can just make green orange if i really want (ew)
<edit>	my posted screenshot shows what i have done
<junka>	iit_; there is always linux-lts for being safe from kernel problems while still getting timed security updates ;)
<rtmf>	only aalib-color will suffer :-p
<iit_>	maty, i have my  final submission and i had installed docker and vmware which i am working on, i just don't want to end up messing it.
<iit_>	right now there might not be any patches available for vmware to work under 4.0 kernel
<rtmf>	it updated from 10.04->14.04 during its life...that's enough
<maty>	iit_: was just gonna recommend the lts kernel before junka was faster on it.
<rtmf>	i decided it was time when their butchering of dnsmasq took me 8 hours to realize wasn't my routing problem
<tekken>	ah.
<n00balert>	i wouldn't run prod on arch
<tekken>	oats and jasmine tea
<tekken>	:)
<iit_>	maty, i am on 3.19, tried lts but vmware itsn't working atm with it so i just back to 3.19
<foutrelis>	iit_: less vmware; more virtualbox
<tekken>	virtualbox is win.
<rtmf>	n00balert: eh i've been *nixing for 18y and my prod so far is running smoother on arch
<tekken>	qemu is win
<rtmf>	mind you its not much *yet*
<tekken>	vmware sad face
<n00balert>	iit_: how's docker?
<iit_>	foutrelis, windows8 for recording stuff, vbox not that good with it
<rtmf>	but with arch i get just what i ask for, good and bad
<foutrelis>	iit_: less windows 8; more windows 7
<rtmf>	with ubu its not even debian where it often makes some sense, they just chop shit up so it "just works" in their little tiny world
<n00balert>	rtmf: mine breaks often with updates...either kernel issues or libraries
<rtmf>	andi f i change shit it just falls over
<iit_>	n00balert, superb docker rocks
<n00balert>	with apps...well xen only
<n00balert>	dom0
<iit_>	foutrelis, vbox have sound issue whichever version of windows i use..
<tekken>	iit_: i recommend grabbing a copy of windows 2000 for windows stuff.
<tekken>	lightning in a bottle.
<rtmf>	n00balert: never had that on my desktop (unlike with ubu), currently ready to reboot nic/ns/node.xh into the latest kernel
<tekken>	does software still work on windows 2000?
<iit_>	tekken, hahaha can  you land me a copy of windows 2k ?
<tekken>	iit_: i wish.
<n00balert>	rtmf: gl
<tekken>	i need a copy myself for windows junk.
<n00balert>	i've gotten used to arch...would hate to switch.
<iit_>	how long i can be on 3.19 kernel ?
<tekken>	n00balert: i have that same problem.... but i'm still super resistant to systemd. :|
<n00balert>	i finally learned a thing or two about netctl...doesn't hate it as much
<tekken>	systemd tries to do too much
<tekken>	its not the linux way.
<quinnstorm>	n00balert: i have done slack, deb, gentoo, some rh/fed, some suse, ubu, and now i really like arch
<n00balert>	it's simple
<n00balert>	but man these 'pacman -syu' issues lol
<smirky>	n00balert: don't tell anyone
<quinnstorm>	n00balert: issues?
<smirky>	or people from ubuntu might infect the community
<quinnstorm>	n00balert: which de/etc. do you use?
<n00balert>	lol
<n00balert>	i haven't learned systemd...i'm still an rc person
<foutrelis>	ewww rc scripts
<n00balert>	nor i want to i guess
<n00balert>	ew
<smirky>	what's to learn about it
<quinnstorm>	n00balert: ah.  systemd and *proper* systemd is part of why i really am hot on moving to arch
<foutrelis>	rc scripts are a mess compared to systemd service files :3
<quinnstorm>	ubu still systemd->rc-wrapper's a lot
<quinnstorm>	*that sa8d
<sw33tlull4by>	can s.o. feed me info on why ssh-fingerprints between sftp and ssh are changing for the same host?
<quinnstorm>	*that said*
<quinnstorm>	rc files are nice in their simplicity, and you could write similar shit in bash, its just so much easier with service files
<quinnstorm>	i remember a few gentoo attempts at it, upstart, etc.
<tekken>	i never figured honey would be so good in oats.
<tekken>	i'm surprised.
<quinnstorm>	the one thing that's taking a ton of getting used to is the journal, but again a formalized log format is nice, and its not as "binary" as people like to bitch
<n00balert>	quinnstorm: i had good luck with arch+de...and i want to experiment with arch+steam but...there is steamos now...so my only for arch is xen's dom0
<tekken>	quinnstorm: i'm stuck on debian for the next day or two til my pc parts get here.
<demize>	openrc at least uses cgroups
<tekken>	i can't wait to sit on arch again.... its really no wonder people can't stand systemd with how its being introduced on other distros.
<tekken>	:|
<tekken>	at least arch did it right.
<n00balert>	my shit breaks often but it's rather my fault to blindly run 'pacman -syu' (it's the n word for arch linux )
<demize>	-sy is the n word.
<iit_>	n00balert, n word ?
<tekken>	n00balert: they really stress reading the news before updating.
<quinnstorm>	n00balert: de
<quinnstorm>	?
<tekken>	i actually use a wrapper that tells me the latest arch news if there is any prior to updates.
<tekken>	really handy.
<tekken>	:|
<n00balert>	quinnstorm: no de...just base terminal...i use it as my hypervisor console
<xyproto>	tekken: smart!
<sheep>	pacmatic?
<quinnstorm>	n00balert: oh i meant your comment, was confused
<quinnstorm>	been using arch+kde5 for a while now
<tekken>	i wonder if the guy i live with will freak out if i put a massive satchel of eggs in his fridge.
<tekken>	i need mass amounts of protein and vitamns.
<tekken>	vitamins*
<sw33tlull4by>	thanks for your time, try to find it out another way bb
<quinnstorm>	i really do like arch, its most of the things i like about gentoo without a lot of the bad (real packages, directly packaged, complete, optional deps compiled in where compiled, aur is pretty damn complete even compared to ppas, etc.)
<n00balert>	quinnstorm: yeah kde ftw
<quinnstorm>	i'm the gpl'd girl, and you will get my advanced-> button when you pry it from my cold dead terminal
<quinnstorm>	(re: kde)
<tekken>	i don't like kde, but i don't hate on people that use it.
<tekken>	i'm so used to having a shitty system i can't bring myself to use it even on my nice hardware nowadays.
<iit_>	kde is not bad.
<iit_>	i dislike gnome even more..
<n00balert>	it's 'loaded'
<quinnstorm>	tekken: i use kde5 on an atom model name      : intel(r) atom(tm) cpu n450   @ 1.66ghz
<quinnstorm>	with 1gb ddr2
<quinnstorm>	mostly to run konsole/x2goclient
<quinnstorm>	but still
<tekken>	quinnstorm: i do a lot of shuffling.
<n00balert>	gnome is trying to be osx
<quinnstorm>	i've run kde since kde2
<n00balert>	that's a fail strategy
<tekken>	quinnstorm: then i can understand why its hard to switch.
<iit_>	n00balert, and it's quite shitty
<quinnstorm>	n00balert: exactly, and not even doing it well.  it also caught a bad case of mono.
<tekken>	i started out on blackbox.
<tekken>	and now i use openbox.
<tekken>	:|
<quinnstorm>	tekken: oh i've also used gnome, written a dock panel applet for xfce4, etc.
<iit_>	ubuntu also copying osx
<quinnstorm>	ion3
<quinnstorm>	i ran the beryl project
<quinnstorm>	etc.
<quinnstorm>	i try not to be so strongly attached to something without having a good view of the alternatives
<n00balert>	mono lol
<quinnstorm>	hell i used the hell out of windows xp when it came out
<jushur>	xfc4 lover here .)
<tekken>	i don't know why i like openbox so much.
<tekken>	it's just nice.
<n00balert>	quinnstorm: is that a real life advice? :)
<quinnstorm>	i've used the *boxen
<tekken>	i'm a man of simple tastes.
<quinnstorm>	n00balert: it helps, i really do try to actually know what i'm bitching about, it helps
<tekken>	dmenu+tint2+openbox = a complete system
<tekken>	as far as i'm concerned
<quinnstorm>	tekken: i'm a woman of simple tastes...if i don't have root on it (conceptually/literally) i will get it or don't want it
<iit_>	awesome wm all done :)
<quinnstorm>	if i can't fix it i don't own it
<tekken>	quinnstorm: i really can't stand not having root.
<n00balert>	lol
<tekken>	i had to go through training at work to get root on the servers.
<n00balert>	i failed...i run arch as my base system

<tekken>	it really pissed me off.
<quinnstorm>	tekken: i have currently two linoden booted
<junka>	quinnstorm; you run kde on a netbook :o
<tekken>	junka: i was surprised as well.
<tekken>	kde doesn't like me that much.
<n00balert>	sudo isn't enough?

<ioanm>	it now compiles
<n00balert>	eh
<quinnstorm>	node.bso, node.xh -- if you use 2600:3c01:e000:117::7fae:cccd for dns you get the .xh -- haven't migrated .bso to a zone file yet since its likely to remain internal
<quinnstorm>	lower prio
<quinnstorm>	bso - beautifulsunrise.org
<tekken>	gobash.ninja
<tekken>	i don't know why i bought the domain.
<tekken>	:(
<guiburgueira>	fstab for auto mounting works?
<n00balert>	lol
<tekken>	i just seen .ninja domain names and
<n00balert>	tekken: it's coz ur a nerd
<tekken>	went for gold
<junka>	tekken; i have run gnome/kde on a netbook too, but its slaggish once you start multitask
<quinnstorm>	node.beautifulsunrise.org/node.xh.beautifulsunrise.org if you need to resolve from legacy icann
<n00balert>	quintenssential (i can't even spell it)
<tekken>	i should have bought microsoft.ninja and resold it to microsoft for big bucks.
<quinnstorm>	...
<quinnstorm>	sometime around when i finally start using redmine or whichever issue tracker i finally settle on
<tekken>	quinnstorm: use trac.
<tekken>	its excellent.
<quinnstorm>	tekken: used to
<quinnstorm>	it used to be slowish
<quinnstorm>	but linoden are awesome
<quinnstorm>	and make them fight
<tekken>	wsgi fixed the slow-ish.
<quinnstorm>	also xh gets ldap not just pam/passwd for users
<quinnstorm>	finally moving past
<tekken>	haha.
<quinnstorm>	(on bso all my services are pam-backed)
<tekken>	trac takes a lot of configuration up front.... but its really worth all the effort.
<tekken>	it looks purty too.
<quinnstorm>	so you add to xmpp-access for ejabberd, etc.
<quinnstorm>	tekken: we used trac for beryl
<quinnstorm>	i loved it
<quinnstorm>	it was just slow
<quinnstorm>	also does it have like...cmdline and/or android clients?
<quinnstorm>	if not may have to write 'em
<tekken>	quinnstorm: a lot of the issue with that was it used to be ran in strictly cgi or mod_python.
<tekken>	both of which are poor as shit.
<quinnstorm>	(trac's even python, my personal favorite of the gen4? gen5? langs)
<quinnstorm>	*nods
<quinnstorm>	right, i need to get apache up on xh anyway
<quinnstorm>	..or should i deprecate that too?
<quinnstorm>	>.>
<tekken>	o.0
<quinnstorm>	i'm pretty sure people like nginx now for a lot of things
<tekken>	is it bad that i'm a new age kid doing c/c++ programming?
<tekken>	most people use java and stuff nowadays.
<quinnstorm>	tekken: oh i still reach for c generally
<tekken>	it saddens me.
<tekken>	:(
<quinnstorm>	maybe a smattering of c++
<quinnstorm>	or really bash for most shit
<quinnstorm>	b/c its not really programming
<quinnstorm>	just "damnit this should be automated"
<tekken>	quinnstorm: bash is the enjoyment of my day.
<quinnstorm>	tekken: github.com/rtmf/env
<n00balert>	jushur: xfc4 is cool...too nerdy but cool.
<quinnstorm>	working on putting together all my bash shit
<quinnstorm>	that reminds me -- anyone know how to get mosh and mouse to play nice?
<tekken>	quinnstorm: any particular reason you uploaded your authorized keys?
<quinnstorm>	tekken: easy deployment, its just for me, i'll figure that out later, they're just pubkeys anyway
<quinnstorm>	the private key i usually use is actually on my gpg keyring
<tekken>	i used to have a deployment system that would upload all my scripts to whichever server i ssh'd into.
<quinnstorm>	contains some very hacky shit too
<tekken>	and set my path and such
<quinnstorm>	install doesn't even work yet >.>
<quinnstorm>	i'm just lazy
<quinnstorm>	and busy
<tekken>	lol.
<quinnstorm>	and unpaid
<supergeek800>	it works, system's bootable again, but for some reason x starts in low-res, and all control of the computer is gone, any way to fix that other than to reinstall or?
<tekken>	i had it all automated.... but i worked for a hosting company.
<quinnstorm>	btw, no problem w/ reboot
<tekken>	and now i do again.... but they banned that practice. :(
<quinnstorm>	tekken: oh i would / i will
<quinnstorm>	but i'm in the process of this os swap
<quinnstorm>	etc.
<n00balert>	quinnstorm: not even underpaid eh
<quinnstorm>	n00balert: ...does room & board count?
<quinnstorm>	(startup, pre-funding basically)
<n00balert>	it counts if you have people to talk?
<quinnstorm>	also on the side working on beautiful sunrise solutions
<quinnstorm>	i'll consult for ya for not much ;)
<tekken>	quinnstorm: you lack the jobs?
<n00balert>	or people that know what you're talking about
<tekken>	:o
<quinnstorm>	tekken: yeah i'm crazy
<quinnstorm>	also, out f date resume - http://beautifulsunrise.org/evangela/resume.pdf
<tekken>	quinnstorm: like bonkers nutty can't work in a public environment?
<g0ts1ck>	any ideas suggestions, are appriciate : https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=196801
<quinnstorm>	nah
<phrik>	title: arhitecture for custom repo / arch discussion / arch linux forums (at bbs.archlinux.org)
<quinnstorm>	tekken: like autisticish enough i can't go through the whole getting a job process, had a massive nasty breakup leave me homeless for a bit, etc.
<quinnstorm>	but have worked for vmware, everex, etc.
<quinnstorm>	well see resume
<quinnstorm>	unreliable brain is unreliable.
<quinnstorm>	stimulants help.
<supergeek800>	like it boots, but x starts at i think 1024x768, and can't be controlled by keyboard or mouse, i'll likely look more into it tomorrow, i'm just happy it boots again.
<tekken>	quinnstorm: we'd get along great.... i had a nasty divorce take everything i had.... still recovering from that bit
<tekken>	thus the daily bike rides to work
<tekken>	:p
<tekken>	i still have a lot of "stupidity moments"
<tekken>	-.-
<quinnstorm>	tekken: worst part is? after she took me to the store to get something for her, dropped me off, and was gone when i got out / her shit was gone / she was off with some guy she'd been seeing (we're poly, that was ok, but this wasn't) -- after that? i can't be mad at her b/c she has a stable roof & food & is in college again
<quinnstorm>	it was always flaky...stimulants and the right environment both really help bring it back, though its only recently i feel lke i can think like i was 12 again
<quinnstorm>	back then quantum physics wasn't *easy* (never is) but was in a way second nature in training
<quinnstorm>	>.>
<quinnstorm>	in the middle bit?
<quinnstorm>	...
<quinnstorm>	anyway not here to bitch or go ot like that
<tekken>	quinnstorm: i got caught up on the whole girl part. xd
<tekken>	i had to think about that for a minute.
<quinnstorm>	come to #sunrise if you wanna talk to me about my personal shit
<quinnstorm>	i dun wanna spam
<quinnstorm>	tekken: <-- transgirl, that's another issue
<g0ts1ck>	is there password query for downloading certain package
<n00balert>	g0ts1ck: you may need to set up a tftp server...if you want to install new clinets over the network
<g0ts1ck>	n00balert: i'm looking for something like this "pacman -s package -p pass)21word
<n00balert>	i was referring to your question earlier...
<g0ts1ck>	the link ?
<n00balert>	yes
<g0ts1ck>	i'm sure you didnt understand the question
<n00balert>	and i'm not sure what you want to accomplish with password protected package install...?
<n00balert>	g0ts1ck: that might be true as well
<g0ts1ck>	i'm in a big need for that
<g0ts1ck>	password protected package
<n00balert>	big need...
<g0ts1ck>	unfortanutly
<namarrgon>	see if pacman can use sftp through libcurl
<g0ts1ck>	it can wget but the password must be inserted in pacman.conf witch is not an option
<n00balert>	g0ts1ck: it seems redundant
<n00balert>	password security...hm
<g0ts1ck>	yea it might seem strange
<n00balert>	isn't key+host not enough?
<jackdaniel>	scp guest@my.mysterious.non-disclosed.domain.dot.com:~/package.tar.xz && pacman -u package.tar.xz (?)
<g0ts1ck>	jackdaniel: it aint really an option
<g0ts1ck>	n00balert: not really
<n00balert>	eh
<n00balert>	gl
<g0ts1ck>	ty will need it
<g0ts1ck>	tought of modifying pacman completly
<g0ts1ck>	but i'm sure someone has made it allready
<g0ts1ck>	at least an mvp
<g0ts1ck>	minimum valuable product
<jackdaniel>	just create a wrapper for sake of simplicity with getopt and stuff
<namarrgon>	i don't think the demand for pw-protected repos is very high
<g0ts1ck>	namarrgon: probably right
<g0ts1ck>	but it could be usefull
<jackdaniel>	and this wrapper can use your precious -p flag
<jackdaniel>	to fetch stuff
<n00balert>	lol
<n00balert>	cheers
<demize>	b0ne_: you can use -u with remote packages... but whyz
<n00balert>	g0ts1ck: if you had mentioned 'passphrase' i'd be more inclined to take what you want to accomplish more seriously
<g0ts1ck>
<g0ts1ck>
<g0ts1ck>	n00balert: did i meantion passphrase ? :p
<n00balert>	if someone has access to install package why would i care if they know the password for the package....
<g0ts1ck>	becouse i'm making a personal os for my company
<g0ts1ck>	with its own rpeo
<g0ts1ck>	*repo
<n00balert>	and
<g0ts1ck>	and not all will have all packages
<g0ts1ck>	simple as that
<n00balert>	there must be a 'better' way
<n00balert>	doesn't sound very simple
<n00balert>	soon you'll have 50 passwords to remember
<rkreis_>	passwords are usually a bad idea
<n00balert>	or store
<jackdaniel>	i think you don't trust your employees much, do you?
<n00balert>	the first thing they'll 'want to' leak is passswords to their 'friends' to install their favorite package :)
<rkreis_>	or maybe it's not about trust but some reward system :)
<rkreis_>	"you are allowed to use vim for a week"
<n00balert>	i'll hack the shit out of that restriction...
<jackdaniel>	like - you'll get access to pidgin, if you finish this job ;p remember, it will deactivate in 8h
<g0ts1ck>	jackdaniel: i trust employes
<g0ts1ck>	but customers
<g0ts1ck>	are problem ;)
<n00balert>	dude no passwords
<n00balert>	g0ts1ck: what if i'm you're customer and i told the 'password' to another customer?
<n00balert>	another happy customer
<jackdaniel>	don't get me wrong, but this idea sounds really broken
<jackdaniel>	i'd go to key/host method (someone mentioned it), if you really must *hide* your stuff
<rkreis_>	g0ts1ck, if you explain the background and motivation well, i'm sure someone here will come up with one or two good solutions :)
<n00balert>	jackdaniel: i think he wants to go a step further and allow certain users be able to install certain packages...
<g0ts1ck>	exactly n00balert
<n00balert>	not necessarily install the base os over the network :)
<n00balert>	that's what i thought you wanted in your link question...
<g0ts1ck>	i distribute the os, with base repo
<jackdaniel>	so easier soultion would be keeping custom [repo] server=myhost/secret-folder-as-password/ entries
<g0ts1ck>	now base repo should handle new client
<jackdaniel>	then forcing users to mangle with passwords
<jackdaniel>	whatever, i've got to go, hf \o
<g0ts1ck>	jackdaniel: you green
<g0ts1ck>	n00balert: i own the product and i''ll do what i want with it
<jushur>	zfs acl and vdev is all i say, so nice to manage ppls rights
<n00balert>	g0ts1ck: doesn't sound very 'open source' ish
<g0ts1ck>	i live from it
<g0ts1ck>	these are my products protected with the help of arch
<g0ts1ck>	nothing wrong with it
<n00balert>	then you might as well give them a console that lists all the packages they could install
<n00balert>	and tailor it for each user
<g0ts1ck>	yea but you can allways pacman -ss
<mrelendig>	write your own package manager on top of alpm
<mrelendig>	or just use gnome apps or similar
<mrelendig>	per user packages instead
<n00balert>	g0ts1ck: not if they don't have a shell :)
<n00balert>	anyway..gl...password idea isn't very bright tho
<mrelendig>	allowing users to install packages system wide is pretty silly
<n00balert>	g0ts1ck: it might be that every time they invoke pacman it gives them a menu driven package installer with only the packages available to them. like mrelendig you might be leaning towards writing your own package manager...
<g0ts1ck>	hmm yea pretty sure that i'd have to modify pacman
<n00balert>	i love console menus...except when i have to check/uncheck options
<jackdaniel>	do you refer to menuconfig? :p
<jackdaniel>	g0ts1ck: what do you mean by saying i'm green? it's offence, or should i take it as a good card?
<mrelendig>	what's wrong with space?
<g0ts1ck>	you good jackdaniel
<jackdaniel>	still don't understand you unfortunately
<mystyfly>	hello everyone, i have a quick question: is it possible to create a command in vim that exits vim and closes the terminal as well?
<mrelendig>	sure
<mrelendig>	but why?
<mystyfly>	mrelendig: i frequently open a terminal to edit one file. after editing the file i close the terminal again. for that i use 2 commands, one to quit vim and one to close the terminal. i'd rather do it in one
<g0ts1ck>	so the n00balert runned away ?
<wildefyr>	mystyfly: pretty sure there's a method to open a terminal running one program, after the program stops running, the terminal emulator will close too
<wildefyr>	i can't remember how to do it though
<mrelendig>	mystyfly: just use gvim
<mrelendig>	mystyfly: or just keep vim running and use vim --remote-silent
<tomty89>	wildefyr: echo hello; exit *shrug*
<mystyfly>	well that's just one use case. say i do some programming, when i'm done i close vim but manually have to close the terminal too
<mrelendig>	simples solution is to just use gvim
<wildefyr>	tomty89: yeah some function for that vim $1; exit
<mrelendig>	it is better anyway
<mkoskar>	mystyfly: depending on your terminal: xterm -e <command>, urxvt -e <command>, etc.
<mystyfly>	wildefyr: then i'd need to specify that when opening up
<wildefyr>	yeah
<wildefyr>	i wouldn't call using gvim a solution though, fuck gvim
<mystyfly>	hm i'm not very happy with that
<wildefyr>	still don't know why the only package on arch with clipboard support is gvim
<mystyfly>	i was looking for a command to execute in vim that closes vim and the terminal
<mrelendig>	wildefyr: because clipboard support requires +x11
<mrelendig>	wildefyr: for obvious reasons
<wildefyr>	yes, but it means i have to install actual gvim
<wildefyr>	for 1 feature
<jackdaniel>	xclip? (:
<mrelendig>	wildefyr: ....
<mrelendig>	wildefyr: and?
<mrelendig>	so fucking what?
<wildefyr>	i just hate gvim
<jackdaniel>	wildefyr: bound custom command to xclip
<wildefyr>	that is all
<mrelendig>	....
<mrelendig>	you can still run "vim"
<mrelendig>	fyi gvim is just a symlink to vim
<mrelendig>	btw
<mrelendig>	installed size : 2941.00 kib
<mrelendig>	installed size : 2619.00 kib
<mrelendig>	"so much wasted hdd space!"
<wildefyr>	i wasn't even complaining about that..
<tekken>	o.o
<tekken>	i'm so hot
<tekken>	cuz i'm fly
<mrelendig>	sure you were, indirectly
<jackdaniel>	mystyfly: but why not just close terminal after saving file? (like, idk, alt+f4)?
<wildefyr>	not really, i hate gvim on principle, you should never use, its entire existance is pointless
<wildefyr>	use it*
<mrelendig>	nha
<john_f>	maybe some patricide of the parent shell will do it, and maybe leave .swp files everywhere.
<mrelendig>	gvim > vim
<mrelendig>	also, abs exists, roll your own vim package if this bothers you so much
<jackdaniel>	(> emacs gvim vim)
<wildefyr>	nvim>vim
<mystyfly>	jackdaniel: well my key combination that closes windows is shift+mod+c so... :d
<tomty89>	ctrl+d
<mrelendig>	neovim sadly have some really stupid design desisions :/
<jackdaniel>	mystyfly: that's why i said "idk", i have super_l+c
<wildefyr>	mrelendig: like?
<tomty89>	mod+shift+q
<p2e>	pico/nano forever
<demonicmaniac3>	there is one massive reason for gvim
<jackdaniel>	ed¡
<demonicmaniac3>	highlighting and shit in gvim is loads faster
<tekken>	jackdaniel: you're my hero.
<tekken>	i drink you nightly.
<mkoskar>	mystyfly: you want to open your terminal with "-e" and the program to be used, so when it exits terminal closes, simple, ... or you can start interactively and open $ exec vim
<demonicmaniac3>	terminal escape codes for color are slow as feck
<jackdaniel>	tekken: lol :-)
<mrelendig>	wildefyr: the input lib they use, their resistence to xdg basedir, some of the api choices etc
<wildefyr>	fair enough
<mrelendig>	biggest problem with gvim is that it isn't gtk3
<mrelendig>	and probably will never be ported
<mystyfly>	mkoskar: thanks, the exec option looks good :)
<mrelendig>	remove all the gui elements and gvim becomes a better version of vim, in the same amount of screen space
<wildefyr>	mrelendig: nah, not for me, gvim is always larger
<mrelendig>	wildefyr: use a less crappy wm then
<mrelendig>	^_^
<wildefyr>	i3?
<jackdaniel>	wildefyr: i recommend buildroot for you, archlinux is *big*
<wildefyr>	k
<demonicmaniac3>	!slap p2e
<phrik>	p2e: i shall slap you with my stuffed tux!
<mrelendig>	you might be confused due to the bottom line, thinking that it is larger when it really isn't though
<demonicmaniac3>	e3 forever
<wildefyr>	maybe, i don't care enough though
<demonicmaniac3>	full editor in 13k
<demonicmaniac3>	\o/
<p2e>	phrik: oh hey, someone's paying attention =]
<p2e>	er
<p2e>	demonicmaniac3: ^
<elite6809>	hey, i'm having some trouble writing to a mounted usb drive. it's mounted to /mnt with gid set to the storage group, which i'm a member of, but i can't write to the drive still, even after chown storage and chmod g+wrx
<mrelendig>	findmnt /mnt
<elite6809>	gives: /mnt   /dev/sdf1 vfat   rw,relatime,gid=95,fmask=0022,dmask=0022,codepage=437,iocharset=iso8859-1,shortname=mixed,errors=remount-ro
<jackdaniel>	have you just added yourself to group and forgotten to logout and login again maybe?
<mrelendig>	elite6809: fat doesn't do posix permissions
<grawity>	elite6809: well, it says "fmask=0022", so files will always have mode 0644
<mrelendig>	you have to set the permissions at mount time
<jackdaniel>	right
<grawity>	elite6809: chmod is ineffective on fat
<elite6809>	i see - still, i'm a member of group 95 (storage), so it should work right? i set -o gid=95 upon mounting
<elite6809>	or am i missing something
<mrelendig>	elite6809: you should umount it and use udisks2 instead
<tomty89>	mask=0 !
<mrelendig>	if you want user friendly mounting
<guiburgueira>	i need help. my gnome can't acess my external drives mounted via fstab in system boot. not enough pemrmitions.. what can i do?
<mrelendig>	guiburgueira: findmnt whatever
<guiburgueira>	escalate x ins't recommended afaik
<mrelendig>	pot output
<tomty89>	do noy use fstab for them *shrug*
<mrelendig>	post*
<tomty89>	we love pot
<guiburgueira>	this location cannot be displayed. you do not have the permissions necessary to view the contents of “hd1”.
<tekken>	getting sleepy.
<guiburgueira>	this in gnome
<tomty89>	guiburgueira: that sounds weird
<g0ts1ck>	mrelendig:  :p
<guiburgueira>	they are mounted in /media
<guiburgueira>	should i change the permitions?
<guiburgueira>	let me try..
<tomty89>	probably not
<tomty89>	workaround-ish
<mrelendig>	post actual output already
<tomty89>	!wtf findmount
<phrik>	tomty89: what the hell is findmount?
<jackdaniel>	findmnt °
<jackdaniel>	sorry :d
<tomty89>	target is meh for findmnt
<guiburgueira>	 findmount: command not found
<guiburgueira>	hm
<mrelendig>	11:53:23  mrelendig ╡ guiburgueira: findmnt whatever
<mrelendig>	helps if you actually write what i said
<guiburgueira>	target            source    fstype options
<mrelendig>	target should be wherever the stuff is mounted
<mrelendig>	alternativly you can copy/paste the relevant lines from the output of mount
<guiburgueira>	 /media/drives/hd1 /dev/sda2 ntfs   rw,relatime,uid=0,gid=0,fmask=0177,dmask=077,
<mrelendig>	well there is your problem
<tomty89>	defaults!
<mrelendig>	sure this is a external drive?
<mrelendig>	also is ntfs-3g installed?
<mrelendig>	esata?
<guiburgueira>	old drive, was used in windows some time ago
<guiburgueira>	i just switched my os
<tomty89>	fuse!
<mrelendig>	how is it connected?
<guiburgueira>	sata
<tomty89>	arch should disable kernel ntfs driver *shrug*
<mrelendig>	so it is not a external drive after all
<mrelendig>	just mount it in fstab instead
<guiburgueira>	extra disk
<guiburgueira>	i mounted already
<tomty89>	mrelendig: huh does it matter?
<mrelendig>	tomty89: yes
<tomty89>	especially when it's an ntfs fs
<demize>	tomty89: different polkit rules
<guiburgueira>	my options i got from some help topics in forums
<tomty89>	ugh yeah you need to enter password though
<mrelendig>	tomty89: because the default rules does not allow users to automount/access internal disks
<mrelendig>	and it is not like you are going to unplug/replug it every 5 mins, so just adding a fstab entry is the easiest
<tomty89>	which i feel safe with though
<tomty89>	depends on how often you want access i'll say
<demonicmaniac3>	and the controller
<demonicmaniac3>	few esata controllers work well in linux :?
<guiburgueira>	tomty89, enter pw where? my gnome doesn't show me a text input
<demonicmaniac3>	some go apeshit when you don't have the drive plugged in at boot
<tomty89>	guiburgueira: i mean if you didn't have an fstab entry for it
<inad922>	how can i define environment variables which are system wide
<tomty89>	/etc/profile(.d)
<mrelendig>	pam_enviroment
<terajl>	hi there, i'm encrypting a file with gpg, i do "gpg -c file.txt" and it askes for a password and encrypts, but when i do "gpg teste.txt.gpg" i get "gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase" but it decrypts without asking for a password, where does it keeps the password?
<fuxy>	terajl: i don't remember what tha package is called but it's basically your password maanager and i believe you can set in the setting how long it should remember it
<tomty89>	huh for cli?
<guiburgueira>	i found a solution i guess, the user option should do the trick
<tomty89>	guiburgueira: just get ntfs-3g and use defaults
<shadowkatstudios>	laptop drives are not meant to run 24/7
<demize>	hmm, pinged out....
<tekken>	ohai
<demize>	it stores the passphrases in the gpg agent, if he comes back.
<tekken>	what's up my lovelies.
<tomty89>	guiburgueira: you might need to tune the mask though
<tomty89>	guiburgueira: user(s) is about whether your user can mount it or not, that only mean something for you if you use noauto or something
<tomty89>	guiburgueira: coz it's mounted, you just don't get access
<guiburgueira>	hm
<guiburgueira>	oh dam.. i just instaled the 3g
<guiburgueira>	what now?
<mrelendig>	remount
<mrelendig>	and don't use the users option
<guiburgueira>	change something on fstab?
<mrelendig>	just permamount it in fstab
<tomty89>	guiburgueira: i suggested you start with just "defaults"
<fuxy>	i'm having a little a bit of trouble with sound over display port after monitor goes to sleep. anyone got any ideas?
<tomty89>	fuxy: what driver
<mrelendig>	fuxy: post actual errors etc
<fuxy>	nvidia
<tomty89>	hmm
<guiburgueira>	tomty89, i already use defaults
<guiburgueira>	it loads all those options
<tomty89>	guiburgueira: remount then
<guiburgueira>	remount via "mount"?
<tomty89>	fuxy: yeah what trouble. is the device gone or what
<guiburgueira>	or the ntfs-3g has a command?
<tomty89>	guiburgueira: umount / mount is okay in arch
<tomty89>	guiburgueira: coz our dev added a symlink to blind them from the kernel driver
<tomty89>	guiburgueira: otherwise you need either its own command or -t ntfs-3g (and in fstab)
<tomty89>	btw iirc the kernel driver is kind of danagerous
<guiburgueira>	tomty89, now i can access
<tomty89>	grats \o/
<tomty89>	eazy breezy
<guiburgueira>	for doing this auto i need to change anything?
<tomty89>	what auto? you mean mount at boot?
<guiburgueira>	or after setting up fstab i'm ready to go?
<guiburgueira>	ntfs-3g does its thing automatically i mean
<guiburgueira>	?
<tomty89>	does what thing? i don't get you
<guiburgueira>	the permitions change
<tomty89>	ntfs-3g is just the fuse alternative of the kernel ntfs driver
<tomty89>	the reason that the permission is okay now is because they have different defaults
<guiburgueira>	hm, with it i will never have this issue :d
<guiburgueira>	thanks for the help and explanation!
<guiburgueira>	tomty89 rep+
<tomty89>	(unless the dev changes it :p)
<guiburgueira>	a !rep bot would be awesome
<shanemikel>	is there a server for web load balancing that is simple to configure and light (preferably exclusively for load balancing)
<fuxy>	tomty89: not it's still there but after monitor goes to sleep when it comes back there's no sound coming trough it any more
<tomty89>	fuxy: have you check journal/dmesg or may be even alsamixer?
<fuxy>	tomty89: login out and back in fixes it thought (i'm using cinnamon)
<tomty89>	fuxy: also pulseaudio if you're using it
<tomty89>	maybe the profile/sink is changed
<tomty89>	if relogin fixes it sounds like a pulse thing
<nichego>	is there a preferable choice between 'find /some/dir | grep pattern' and 'find /some/dir -regex pattern' ?
<mrelendig>	nichego: piping to grep is stupid
<fuxy>	haven't looked at the loggs touroghly yet but googling around didn't give me any clues
<tomty89>	fuxy: paste the output of `pacmd list-cards` and `pacmd list-sinks` after suspend maybe
<mrelendig>	nichego: and have fun dealing with files with newlines in them and other fun things
<sudokode>	ugh
<sudokode>	why so early
<nichego>	mrelendig: would grep -a solve that?
<tomty89>	!give fuxy ix
<mrelendig>	no
<phrik>	fuxy: curl -f 'f:1=<-' ix.io
<shanemikel>	or grep -print0 | xargs -0 grep
<mrelendig>	not using grep in the first place would
<nichego>	shanemikel: that would do a different thing
<nichego>	mrelendig: okay. thanks
<shanemikel>	rather find ..... -print0 | xargs -n1 -0 grep
<sudokode>	uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
<sudokode>	how about the thing built into find
<sudokode>	find -exec grep foo {} \;
<mrelendig>	he is trying to match on filenames
<mrelendig>	so just use --regex
<shanemikel>	yeah but you don't get the same options as grep (or extended right?)
<sudokode>	find / >index 2>/dev/null
<sudokode>	grep foo index
<mrelendig>	if --regex is not enough then you are doing it wrong
<shanemikel>	regex is always enough, but extended regex is cleaner (slightly) and less verbose in some cases
<sudokode>	redesigning locate is the best way :>
<jezeniel>	a/sda
<demonicmaniac3>	shanemikel: you can select extended/posix/perl as regextype
<shanemikel>	oh.. didn't know that
<shanemikel>	go figure
<sudokode>	grep -v demonicmaniac3 #archlinux
<sudokode>	you've been... negated...
<saivert>	why are there different forms of regular expressions? what is the most common? what is the history of regular expressions?
<tomty89>	!grab sudokode
<phrik>	tomty89: tada!
<shanemikel>	so does somebody have a recommendation for me for a load balancing web server that is easy to configure (for networking dummies like me)..? i don't want to mess with apache virtual hosts
<redwall_hp>	regex is like a hammer. if it's not working, you need to use it harder.
<willer>	i don't see my bios overclocking having any effect on mhz reported by os
<tomty89>	!g load balancing web server
<phrik>	tomty89: load balancing (computing) - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/load_balancing_(computing)>
<sudokode>	shanemikel: nginx?
<shanemikel>	i've looked into it a bit already
<mrelendig>	willer: because you are using the ondemand govenor
<willer>	mrelendig: performance
<shanemikel>	i thought nginx would come back to me on here
<willer>	ignore_ppc.conf trick too
<mrelendig>	willer: you have to tweak it then
<tomty89>	lighttpd
<mrelendig>	also performance will actually clock down
<sudokode>	wat
<sudokode>	only if the processor supports it on its own
<sudokode>	that sounds like a mobile feature
<nichego>	willer: set higher minimum frequency using cpupower. bios overclock is a guideline
<sudokode>	performance should always stay at the max freq
<mrelendig>	depends on what the hardware reports
<sudokode>	hardware is stupid
<mrelendig>	it it says the max freq is 2.4
<sudokode>	this is why we have software :p
<mrelendig>	and you oc to 3
<mrelendig>	it will clock down to 2.4
<shanemikel>	which one seems to have more options if i'm only gonna be using it as a proxy type balancer
<sudokode>	no, that's only if you don't overclock properly or if you're trying to include something like turboboost into your max freq
<fuxy>	tomty89: logging in remotely gives me weird results i'll have do it when i get home. thx though. i'll dig around the logs and get back to you.
<sudokode>	i forget what intel calls it
<saivert>	nginx. don't even bother looking anywhere else. nginx excels at proxying and load balancing tasks. it was primarily designed for that.
<sudokode>	oh that is intel
<tomty89>	fuxy: okay
<sudokode>	then i forget what amd calls it
<tomty89>	p_state?
<sudokode>	turbo core
<sudokode>	where the cpu's max freq can exceed its stock max freq... when the cpu decides it wants to...
<willer>	nichego: didn't help
<tomty89>	hardware limits: 800 mhz - 3.60 ghz
<tomty89>	current cpu frequency is 2.92 ghz.
<tomty89>	<--turbo boost + performance governor
<nichego>	willer: pastebin output of 'cpupower frequency-info'
<tomty89>	model name:            intel(r) core(tm) i5-4570s cpu @ 2.90ghz
<willer>	nichego: http://dpaste.com/16yfvcb
<phrik>	title: dpaste: 16yfvcb (at dpaste.com)
<sudokode>	tomty89: you're actually underclocked
<nichego>	willer: is that amd?
<willer>	yes
<sudokode>	that cpu comes stock at 3.2 with turbo boost at 3.6
<nichego>	i cannot help with that
<shanemikel>	saivert: thanks
<willer>	ah ok. thanks
<tomty89>	sudokode: i'm eco friendly
<sudokode>	why not use ondemand then :d
<tomty89>	sudokode: i do
<nichego>	willer: just in case, you don't have powerd running, do you?
<sudokode>	oic
<tomty89>	sudokode: just testing
<nichego>	as far as i can tell your cpu is now using the maximum freq. reported by hardware limit
<wafflesatan>	hey guys, anyone else having trouble with mpv/youtube-dl since the new youtube api landed ? it's really slow.
<tomty89>	sudokode: actually i use powersave. seems by default only powersave and performance is loaded p_state
<nichego>	a k intel processor would report, say, 1.6 to 3.9 but without bios overclock only 1.6 to 3.7 would be accessible
<sudokode>	willer: that might not be your max freq, but it's the highest step you can do with frequency scaling on that system
<sudokode>	which means you're using a piece of shit cpu
<shanemikel>	saivert: yeah, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense does it.. there is no regular regular expression..
<sudokode>	or an old one
<proshot>	tweakers.net
<proshot>	sorry
<proshot>	wrong channel
<nichego>	well
<proshot>	or better wrong window
<tomty89>	!g tweaker.net
<phrik>	tomty89: tweaker :: new album "call the time eternity" |: <http://tweaker.net/>
<nichego>	he has 800 mhz to 3.1 ghz. and his current freq is 3.10
<willer>	nichego: it's an unlocked phenom ii x4 b50
<sudokode>	nichego: those are his limits and all of the frequencies he can travel through
<sudokode>	available frequency steps: 3.10 ghz, 2.40 ghz, 1.90 ghz, 800 mhz
<proshot>	no its tweakers tomty89
<sudokode>	those are the ones that can be set by the kernel
<proshot>	! tweakers.net
<nichego>	sudokode: yes, and   current cpu frequency is 3.10 ghz.
<proshot>	!g tweakers.net
<phrik>	proshot: tweakers - wij stellen technologie op de proef: <http://tweakers.net/>
<sudokode>	so that's it
<sudokode>	3.1ghz for glory
<willer>	/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/bios_limit has a 3.1ghz value and no powerd running
<sudokode>	willer: 3.1ghz is as high as you can go
<tomty89>	proshot: hmm a language i don't parse :(
<sudokode>	what's the problem
<nichego>	do you expect a higher value, willer?
<willer>	well it's overclocked to about 3.6ghz
<nichego>	hmm
<sudokode>	willer: you can only do frequency scaling in the specific steps allowed by your cpu
<nichego>	it _is_ possible that even when you overlock the hardware keeps reporting the same levels
<sudokode>	if your max freq is on there, then you can't do it
<sudokode>	isn't*
<nichego>	even if the actual levels are spread out between lowest frequency and current highest
<ruan>	you should test the actual performance, not what it reports
<sudokode>	probably a better idea
<willer>	i set max freq to  3.4ghz
<mrelendig>	on some hardware you can change the max freq yourself
<mrelendig>	by poking sys
<sudokode>	hm
<mrelendig>	doesn't work on all though
<willer>	i'll run some benchmarks
<nizumzen>	hmm annoyingly when i upgrade my kernel to 4.0.1 my second monitor stops working properly but when i open up arandr the second monitor is displayed correctly - i have no idea how to debug this properly since the monitor works fine with kernel 3.19.3
<sudokode>	well, usually freq scaling is a little more free range than this
<nichego>	you _may_ glean some more information from powertop, willer
<tomty89>	yeah big steps
<nichego>	also looking into voltage readings from xsensors may provide hints

<proshot>	great bot
<mrelendig>	too little too late amd
<mrelendig>	again
<sudokode>	just run at max frequency and get a better heatsink
<bellbreaker>	my fans are running at max speed and lm-sensors report that my 4 cores are running at 90-100 c, yet the air coming out besides the fans is completely cool. are the sensors faulty?
<sudokode>	you'll be fine
<saivert>	amd should screw tdp and just make a 10ghz cpu
<mrelendig>	saivert: so you are saying amd should turn into pentium 4
<tomty89>	nizumzen: describe not working properly, also which driver and type of connetction
<mrelendig>	oh wait, amd already did that
<tomty89>	*connection
<saivert>	yes. just burn through!
<mrelendig>	their performance per clock is so bad that the only way they can compete with intel is to clock to hell and back
<tomty89>	dear prescott
<mrelendig>	^_^
<nichego>	bellbreaker: what does /etc/sensors3.conf say?
<tomty89>	you are so hot, sidney
<mrelendig>	ironic that amd owned intel by making more efficient processors
<mrelendig>	but now the oposite is happening
<nichego>	intel is reaping the rewards of xscale program
<proshot>	tomty89, its dutch
<bellbreaker>	nichego http://ix.io/idh
<bellbreaker>	i just ran sensors-detect
<nichego>	bellbreaker: had not run it before?
<bellbreaker>	nope
<nichego>	well, now what does lm-sensors say?
<nichego>	or just use xsensors (better presentation)
<bellbreaker>	well i ran it before getting the readings
<nichego>	yours is identical to mine, bellbreaker
<nichego>	i can only assume the chipsets and motherboards are fairly similar
<nichego>	mine gives sensible readings
<nichego>	so, perhaps your cpu really is being fried
<nichego>	(technically, that should not happen. modern cpu's all throttle when they get too hot...)
<tomty89>	but he said the air is cool
<bellbreaker>	i still get the high temps. i am compiling some stuff at the moment though ^^
<nichego>	tomty89: that actually could mean exactly the opposite about your cpu. heat is there and is not being dissipated :p
<saivert>	there is an air gap between the cpu and the heatsink
<saivert>	that is my guess
<tomty89>	but if it's really hot you can still feel it
<nichego>	possible. or thermal paste gone bad
<saivert>	you will burn your hands
<saivert>	so yes you will feel it
<nizumzen>	tomty89: sorry more specific - the display turns on but no images is displayed - amd open source driver (latest version) and the monitor is connected over hdmi
<bellbreaker>	looks like completely idle temperatures are 65-70 c, that seems pretty damn high
<nichego>	bellbreaker: i don't know what cpu you have and what cooling. if it's anything but a very new or very old model the readings from lm-sensors should be reliable and therefore your cpu is probably being fried
<bellbreaker>	it's an i7-4850hq in a macbook pro late 2013
<nichego>	oh... laptop
<nichego>	not really user-serviceable either
<tomty89>	nizumzen: paste xrandr output maybe. if only a kernel downgrade make it work again, perhaps you should file a bug report
<tomty89>	*upstream
<nizumzen>	tomty89: yeah that is what i was thinking - it works perfectly after the kernel downgrade so yeah might be a bug in 4.0.1
<nichego>	it even has vt-d
<nichego>	what use is vt-d on a laptop...
<nichego>	t_j is 100 deg. c, though
<tomty89>	usb passthrough heh
<nichego>	t_case for 4770k is around 72 deg. c
<nichego>	bellbreaker: temperatures that high may be normal for that model
<nichego>	to make really sure you can always run some other os on it from a live disc
<bellbreaker>	from what i can find on google it would seem that way yes. i was just surprised. i hope it doesn't reduce the lifetime too much
<nichego>	well, if intel says t_j is 100 deg. c you probably need not worry
<bellbreaker>	what is t_j?
<nichego>	temperature at junction
<nichego>	the laptop cpu is not socketed
<bellbreaker>	should i see that in the sensors output?
<nichego>	the reading you get is usually t_j
<nichego>	so intel is saying t_j should not exceed 100 deg. c
<nichego>	and you apparently are around 90 deg. c under full load
<nichego>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/junction_temperature
<phrik>	title: junction temperature - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (at en.wikipedia.org)
<nichego>	desktop pc's usually report one t_j per core and and also a separate t_case
<nichego>	if i understand correctly
<bellbreaker>	ah right. well it hits 100 sometimes, but hovers between 90-100. i guess the failsafe is doing its job
<nichego>	you can try running windows from a live disc and cpu-z
<bellbreaker>	this is what i see: http://ix.io/idi
<tomty89>	!wine
<phrik>	do you want some cheese with that w(h)ine?
<bellbreaker>	i think it's alright
<nichego>	i'm fussy. so after confirming the readings are correct i might have called a service center or something like that
<nichego>	just to make sure
<bellbreaker>	alright i should do that then. thanks!
<tomty89>	oops cpu-z doesn't work with wine *whine*
<bellbreaker>	i still have os x on a small partition as recommended in the wiki so i should be able to check using that
<bellbreaker>	surely there must be a temperature app or something
<nichego>	tomty89: naturally
<nichego>	bellbreaker: that's a good idea
<saivert>	there is a cpu-z equivalent for linux but it is made using gambas
<tomty89>	lol
<saivert>	goombas!
<nichego>	normally, xsensors should suffice
<saivert>	http://i-nex.linux.pl/install/
<phrik>	title: install | i-nex (at i-nex.linux.pl)
<nichego>	all of them make the readings from the same kernel module
<saivert>	there you go

<tomty89>	ugh?
<tomty89>	an agent doesn't work?
<tomty89>	btw kde4 and kf5 has different agent, so the symlink thing i talked about yesterday was wrong
<tomty89>	e^0: the thing you edit there would be overwritten on an update
<tomty89>	so it's workaround-ish
<e^0>	tomty89: what might be the permenant solutions than ?
<tomty89>	e^0: didnt you say it works in kde?
<e^0>	tomty89: it works in kde but not in awesome wm
<tomty89>	e^0: and since what you are editing a polkit policy, i think it's probably a missing agent
<tomty89>	e^0: you said you try to start an agent in .xinitrc. does it fail or what?
<e^0>	tomty89: here i mgiht need an awesome compatible polkit agent
<tomty89>	e^0: nah
<tomty89>	e^0: afaik it doesn't really matter
<tomty89>	e^0: also i think you use the same file manager as you do in kde?
<e^0>	it that file instead of auth_admin i replaced with yes for the above 2 options regarding mounts
<willer>	nichego: unigine heaven reports correct ghz
<e^0>	tomty89: yes same file manager

<oats>	bellbreaker: [grains/
<e^0>	it worked now :)
<oats>	]
<tomty89>	e^0: btw you don't have to keep rebooting after you edit .xinitrc
<bellbreaker>	excatly!
<nimpsnawak>	i have got some issues with "rm -rf dir/" with : "rm: cannot remove dir/, non empty"
<e^0>	i have get rid of the notification that's displayed, get stuck forever on the screen regarding policykit1-kde :)
<e^0>	tomty89: logout ?
<nerfquark>	i thought you folks had been talking about the android and ios apps on win10
<tomty89>	e^0: restart x mostly, or logout

<e^0>	ok :)

<phrik>	curl -f 'f:1=<-' ix.io
<cookiekiller>	hey guys, i'm in trouble with gnome 3, setup worked like a charme, installed x / nvidia / gnome. but now the gnome performance seems bad, direct rendering works, glx gears works and so. just gnome is using cpu renderering instead of gpu rendering. i guess i missed some libs or something. can you help me out?
<tomty89>	e^0: consider adding this back to your .xinitrc btw: http://ix.io/idv
<tomty89>	to the top
<namarrgon>	nimpsnawak: is dir/ a mountpoint?
<e^0>	tomty89: added :)
<e^0>	at the top
<tomty89>	e^0: also if you don't want to keep entering password, you may consider having an fstab entry for your drive
<tomty89>	e^0: but that's your preference
<e^0>	tomty89: that will even be better.
<e^0>	tomty89: if you have done similar can you share you fstab file ?
<nimpsnawak>	namarrgon, nope :/
<tomty89>	e^0: eh actually you just prepare a mount point for it, and probably use defaults for the option
<namarrgon>	nimpsnawak: is it on a btrfs volume?
<nimpsnawak>	namarrgon, neither use by any process
<nimpsnawak>	namarrgon, yes
<e^0>	tomty89: the same as /home ?
<namarrgon>	nimpsnawak: bug. umount it run a btrfs check --repair on it
<tomty89>	e^0: yeah something like /dev/sda1 /mountpoint/drive_a vfat defaults 0 0
<e^0>	ok :)
<tomty89>	e^0: you may want to consider the option "nofail" if you unplug it often
<namarrgon>	nimpsnawak: or better, run a "btrfs check" first. it should report the wrong size
<e^0>	ok :)
<tomty89>	e^0: otherwise you might get stuck at a emergency shell if you forget to edit the fstab
<nimpsnawak>	namarrgon, thx !!
<e^0>	other than aweesome which are tiling managers to be considered ?
<tomty89>	e^0: btw if you use an fstab entry the agent is optional
<e^0>	tomty89: ok so fstab entry i can remove that line in .xinitrc ?
<tomty89>	but *shrug* it might help you on other things, idk
<tomty89>	e^0: yes, if you want to
<e^0>	ok :)

<smirky>	did someone notice that since owncloud 8.0.3 there's no pictures app by default?
<wget>	hi guys. for compatibility reasons, i have to downgrade from nginx to apache. but on archlinux, i've a problem: i have no logs. :-/ any idea why apache have no systemd log by default on archlinux?
<smirky>	wget: it has logs in /var/log/httpd/
<saivert>	when you perceive someone as a threat you bestow them with power. don't do it. no man can rule alone.
<wget>	smirky: yep. this folder has been created, and i have some logs in it, but it dates from the pre-systemd period (yes, my archlinux install is quite old)
<smirky>	wget: also, a good httpd.conf is always edited by a user, defaults suck
<tylerdurden01>	ok, so if i start mpd in a terminal, it works, but if i try to start it as a systemd service, i get "cmdline: no configuration file found". anyone got any idea what's wrong?
<oats>	tylerdurden01: what command are you using to start the service?
<tylerdurden01>	oats: systemctl start mpd.service
<oats>	tylerdurden01: try "systemctl --user start mpd"
<oats>	so it runs under your systemd user session and as your user
<smirky>	tylerdurden01: ls -l /etc/mpd.conf ?
<tylerdurden01>	smirky: http://sprunge.us/fzcw
<oats>	smirky: he's starting mpd as root, so mpd wants to look for the universal mpd config and in root's home dir, and it won't see it there
<oats>	tylerdurden01: try my command
<smirky>	oats: he said he did a systemctl start mpd
<oats>	and no sudo
<smirky>	oats: which should look in /etc/mpd.conf
<smirky>	tylerdurden01: i asked for permissions, not a cat :)
<saivert>	music player daemon?
<oats>	saivert: yeah
<saivert>	are we talking about music players again?
<tylerdurden01>	smirky: 0 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 37 apr 30 14:48 m1;36m/etc/mpd.confm -> /home/john/dropbox/linux/etc/mpd.conf
<saivert>	!war music player daemon
<oats>	mpd is the only music player
<phrik>	are we talking about music player daemon again?
<smirky>	confm??
<oats>	confm???
<smirky>	symlinks???
<oats>	oh dear
<tylerdurden01>	smirky: yes, it's a symlink
<n00balert>	nope, i will not sleep until this is fixed
<tylerdurden01>	smirky: hmm, error message's changed after copying the file instead of making it a symlink
<tylerdurden01>	smirky: thanks for pointing me in the right direction :d
<smirky>	tylerdurden01: the default systemd service file is set to run as user: mpd and look for /etc/mpd.conf
<smirky>	not mpd.confm
<smirky>	also those permissions are a problem if the mpd user cant read in your $home
<saivert>	yeah i wouldn't bother with that. just run it as your own user.
<saivert>	you could even set it up as a systemd --user thing
<saivert>	so it launches on login
<wget>	seems there is no apache binary on archlinux, except apachectl :-/
<smirky>	i'm curious, if i edit the mpd user in the .service file to my own user, will it start on boot or on login?
<oats>	wget: you're kidding, right?
<oats>	wget: [extra]/apache
<smirky>	pacman -qo apachectl is owned by "apache" package
<saivert>	i have gotten tired of every service runs as its own user lately so now i just use containers where all the services within the container run as the same user. everything in the container has access to everything. less mess
<oats>	oh wait
<smirky>	so you have it
<oats>	hmm
<oats>	wget: apachectl start
<smirky>	0o
<smirky>	why that way?
<smirky>	and not systemd
<tylerdurden01>	smirky: oh, it was confm?!
<smirky>	you just saw that?
<smirky>	wake up
<wget>	smirky: because as i have no logs, i would like to have debug info.
<oats>	tylerdurden01: still, an easier way to manage mpd would be to start it as your user with the systemd user session and to store the conf in your home directory
<smirky>	wget: then set to have logs
<oats>	just sayin'
<smirky>	wget: it's so damn easy
<smirky>	wget:
<smirky>	ll /var/log/httpd/|sprunge
<smirky>	oops :d
<tylerdurden01>	smirky: no, it wasn't confm, that's just text coloring coming out screwed up when pasting
<smirky>	http://sprunge.us/thsf
<wget>	smirky: i enabled the module to set the logs and debug logs in my httpd.conf file, but i've still no logs into journalctl :-/
<smirky>	journalctl, really?
<wget>	smirky: why not. journalctl aggregates all logs from any sources. why not with apache?
<smirky>	i cant believe that i was usig putty for 2 years and found out there was a multitabbed putty a week ago
<smirky>	i feel like i just got out of the stone age :(
<saivert>	smirky: putty still has bugs. could you fix them? like ctrl + arrow keys are ignored and not passed through
<smirky>	and what do you want to do with them?
<smirky>	just curious
<saivert>	weechat needs those keystrokes. so does a lot of other programs
<saivert>	because of that i'm tempted to just switch to using cygwin's mintty and ssh. that has limited feature set compared to putty but at least all keystrokes work
<smirky>	you're using the beta i guess?
<smirky>	which is in beta for years maybe :d
<saivert>	mintty is based on putty but after reading through the source code it is apparent that they refactored lots of the putty code. as very little matches 1:1
<grawity>	yeah, cygwin used to have puttycyg before
<g0ts1ck>	grawity: can you make repo-add so that .db file looks on certain path ?
<g0ts1ck>	instead of placing it inside the same folder ?
<grawity>	no, that's not something repo-add can affect
<g0ts1ck>	kk
<tom^>	!github repose

<tom^>	g0ts1ck: its most likely not gonna solve what you just asked, but its better to use then directly using repo-add
<g0ts1ck>	nah it does not help me at all :)
<g0ts1ck>	but ty anyway
<demize>	repose can automatically create symlinks though.
<smirky>	anyone experiencing ssh connection drops since linux-4.0.1?
<noremi>	does anyone have issues with wifi-menu after updating to kernel 4.0.1?
<tom^>	smirky: nope, have had 2 ssh connections up and running for uh ~1 week now.
<tom^>	to lazy to exit them :p
<tom^>	noremi: issues?
<noremi>	tom^: running wifi-menu fails with a red error about an unspecified interface
<noremi>	iirc, i'm on 3.19 now
<tom^>	noremi: reboot then.
<smirky>	tom^: linux-4.0.1 landed on [core] yesterday
<smirky>	tom^: ltr :)
<tom^>	smirky: in testing for like 3 weeks
<tom^>	but yes i know.
<bougyman>	people still use ssh?
<noremi>	tom^: i did reboot after the kernel update
<bougyman>	i thought everyone switched to mosh.
<tom^>	bougyman: pfft
<bougyman>	i've had some mosh sessions up for months.
<tom^>	noremi: but you asked about 4.0 and you said you are on 3.19 now?
<tom^>	noremi: im confused.
<tom^>	bougyman: but why?
<tom^>	bougyman: ssh masterrace :p
<thrice>	4.0.1 has not been out for a week, but meh
<noremi>	tom^: i downgraded to 3.19 because of the issues on 4.0
<s00pcan>	tom^: typo in that readme.  "surely though..."
<smirky>	what issue?
<saivert>	4.0.1 ruined my server. thanks a bunch guys
<s00pcan>	is surly instead
<tom^>	thrice: well yea im actually on 4.0.0
<smirky>	noremi: what issue
<tom^>	so fair enough.
<saivert>	as soon as i can get home and connect a monitor i will know what is up though
<thrice>	stop lying
<tom^>	thrice: i didnt notice that last digit
<noremi>	tom^: wifi-menu does not bring up the selection menu and xorg does not allow me to use keyboard and mouse (although they work in the shell)
<t-richards>	been running 4.0.1 for 16 hours without issue
<bougyman>	4.0.1 didn't have many changes that should break any of these things.
<smirky>	t-richards: yep, same
<s00pcan>	bougyman: mosh is gross
<t-richards>	i was on the -lts package previously, had to hop over to the 4.x package to see what all the fuss was about :d
<noremi>	i went from 3.19 to 4.0.1 directly, should i try going to 4.0.0 instead?
<smirky>	ehm, no?
<tom^>	noremi: nah
<disappointment>	lolwut
<tom^>	noremi: i would rather suggest you to stop use netctl
<tom^>	!netctl
<phrik>	users having issues with netctl are advised to try alternatives such as systemd-networkd, networkmanager, or connman.
<tom^>	its horrible
<bougyman>	s00pcan: what do you hate about https://mosh.mit.edu/ ?
<phrik>	title: mosh: the mobile shell (at mosh.mit.edu)
<smirky>	tom^: or wicd
<tom^>	ew no
<t-richards>	4.0.1 and networkmanager seem to work just fine, no problems with ssh either
<smirky>	good ol' wicd!
<smirky>	never lets me down
<noremi>	why doesn't keyboard and mouse work in xorg though (on 4.0.1)?
<disappointment>	tom^: why is netctl so terrible for simple home network setup? i've been using it for a past year without a single issue.
<smirky>	noremi: .xinitrc, xorg logs?
<tom^>	disappointment: for the very same reason windows is terrible but yet just works.
<tom^>	disappointment: horrible code :p
<thrice>	noremi: c'mon, you assume keyb oard and mouse don't work for anyone?
<bougyman>	netctl never got the love of its predecessor (netcfg)
<saivert>	like !g?
<jewfro297>	how do i view the log of things that happened during startup? something failed and i can't see what it is
<tom^>	jewfro297: journalctl , systemctl status , dmesg
<disappointment>	saivert: like !archwiki :p
<jewfro297>	also real quick, how do you disable the beep sound?

<smirky>	is there an android app to monitor the mobile cells of your and other mobile operators?
<disappointment>	saivert: i consider ddg superior to google just because of these bangs, because it usually makes searching at least twice as fast.
<jewfro297>	great, aurget lost track of the fact that pamixer is installed.

<saivert>	the same story with every kernel upgrade
<saivert>	god damn vmware
<tom^>	why is people even using it.
<saivert>	why don't they just push everything upstream already. they are already using much of the upstream code already
<saivert>	just complete it
<jewfro297>	my kernel upgrade broke everything but terminal mode :(
<namarrgon>	rebuild your external modules
<jewfro297>	how?
<namarrgon>	do you use any?
<jewfro297>	also, what is the radeon driver again? fglrx right?
<beest>	no wonder.
<jewfro297>	lol yeah...
<saivert>	no radeon is the free open source one
<saivert>	fglrx is the blob also known as catalyst
<jewfro297>	right but what's the closed source one? that's what i have installed, and pacman seems to no longer see it
<jewfro297>	yeah, so i do pacman -s fglrx and it says package not found, but it's installed
<tom^>	catalyst hasnt been in the repos for decades
<ekkelett>	anyone here familiar with any issues/bugs surrounding wireless and netctl-auto since the wpa_supplicant update?
<tom^>	its in aur, hence you need to rebuild it yourself when kernel updates arrives
<bougyman>	linux xena 4.0.1_1 #1 smp preempt wed apr 29 09:53:11 utc 2015 x86_64 gnu/linux

<teraflop>	heh
<jewfro297>	tom^: well, aurget doesn't seem to see it either
<jewfro297>	it also thinks that pamixer isn't installed when it is
<saivert>	i'm really excited about getting home to see what is the cause of my dead server since 4.0.1 upgrade
<saivert>	it is like xmas day
<saivert>	turn on monitor. magic comes out
<bougyman>	saivert: maybe just an initramfs.
<tom^>	saivert: i rebooted 12 min ago, works just fine here.
<bougyman>	i though i had a 4.0 bug but it was just initramfs b.s.

<saivert>	only need the long hair and a microphone stand
<saivert>	me judging? no way
<ekkelett>	ah yes, regarding netctl-auto and wpa issues " wpa_actiond[601]: error (wlp3s0): could not attach to wpa_supplicant "
<s00pcan>	just use wired lol
<saivert>	!netctl
<phrik>	users having issues with netctl are advised to try alternatives such as systemd-networkd, networkmanager, or connman.
<ekkelett>	if i stop netctl-auto and just connect with wifi-menu, then it works fine
<s00pcan>	i gave up on making wifi reliable on my desktop
<ekkelett>	also, it worked very well before a few days ago s00pcan, so i'm wondering if it's a recent thing -- hasn't been any issue earlier.
<saivert>	just buy a ethernet to wifi bridge. stick it to the back of your laptop
<saivert>	laptop built-in wifi will always suck
<ekkelett>	it seems more to be a bug with the wpa_supplicant update moreso than just "waa waaa built-in wifi is bad mkay" :p
<ekkelett>	furthermore, that just kills any opportunity to learn what the issue is and creates an ugly workaround instead.
<foutrelis>	ekkelett: have you downgraded to 1:2.3-1 that's currently in [core] or are you still using 2.4?
<saivert>	i wouldn't use wifi troubles as a learning experience. that is masochism
<ekkelett>	foutrelis: 2.4 -- i'll try a downgrade, thanks for reminding me of that. (gosh, how could i not think of that?)
<ekkelett>	all troubles can be learning experiences.
<ekkelett>	sticking in adapters and usb-devices to work around issues is messy and looks bad. :p
<ekkelett>	at least if there are easier routes!
<ekkelett>	(not saying bad wifi doesn't exist -- i had hell with broadcom wifi a few years back)
<foutrelis>	ekkelett: by downgrade i mean "upgrade" (pacman -syu) to 1:2.3-1 (the 1: in front, the epoch count's as a bigger version :p)
<ekkelett>	(worst shit ever to get working)
<foutrelis>	ekkelett: as for what the issue was, see the commit message and the links it contains: https://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/commit/trunk?h=packages/wpa_supplicant&id=7562b98bd8
<phrik>	title: svntogit/packages.git - git clone of the 'packages' repository (at projects.archlinux.org)
<ekkelett>	foutrelis: ooo'er, huh, yeah -- must've been something wrong then!
<ekkelett>	omg <3 foutrelis
<namarrgon>	don't thank him, he was the one who broke it in the first place :p
<ekkelett>	tyvm foutrelis for spot-on relevant stuff
<foutrelis>	true :p
<ekkelett>	pscht, still! :d
<godginrai>	namarrgon: at least he took responsibility and fixed what he broke :p
<ekkelett>	stuff breaks. :)
<foutrelis>	moral of the story; don't take applying a security patch as an opportunity to also bump to a newer version
<ekkelett>	heh :d
<godginrai>	a lot of people would be like: "welp, i just fucked things up for you further, so.... !bail"
<namarrgon>	they should have pushed a minor release
<ekkelett>	mmm. either way, if anything, stuff can break at times.
<ekkelett>	was it long in testing though?
<trivia_man>	how do you hibernate on arch
<ekkelett>	i suppose there might not be too many running testing on physical laptops, perhaps
<saivert>	ekkelett: absolutely true. just have to value your time and see if it is worth it. wifi is one of those pain areas on linux. mostly because of shitty proprietary chipsets with horrible vendor cooperation.
<godginrai>	arch pretty much *is* testing
<saivert>	atheros is nice though
<godginrai>	!give trivia_man wiki suspend to disk
<saivert>	one has to buy the right hardware if one wants a painless experience
<phrik>	trivia_man: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/power_management/suspend_and_hibernate
<ekkelett>	saivert: mmm, and likewise with intel, which is what i've got -- which is why i found it odd to suddenly have issues.
<trivia_man>	ty
<ekkelett>	the only thing that is eh-eh with the laptop i have is its touchpad -- elantech.
<ekkelett>	ooo'er, downgrade wpa_supplicant and upgrade to linux 4.0.1.
<ekkelett>	if the versions of linux continue to be a bit more free and willing, i might suddenly have a linux version that correspons to my android version :)
<tom^>	its just a matter of time before we reach skynet now
<trivia_man>	if i want to hibernate, then boot up mint, then boot up arch again without losing progress, do i want to suspend to disk?

<tibl>	if i open firefox and navigate to a site, press ctrl-f and type a bunch of gibberish (1-5 characters is usually enough), my xorg coredumps and gdm session restarts. anyone know anything about this? here are logs of my xorg.0.log and # journalctl -b 0 --since="2015-4-30 09:29:21" --until="2015-4-30 09:29:28" https://gist.github.com/anonymous/11af92067218d3c0fca9

<godginrai>	trivia_man: probably, but you'd have to have separate swap partitions for each distro
<ekkelett>	oh yeeah, tom^, better beware.
<ekkelett>	i imagine at the time of the movie whoever did their consulting for the it "accuracy" must've envisioned that linux 4.1.15 would _not_ be happening any time soon.
<tom^>	ekkelett: oh how wrong they were.
<tom^>	:p
<wasamasa>	how old is the movie?
<tom^>	but i guess since skynet nukes everything linux dev probably stops at 4.1
<beest>	92?
<tom^>	heh
<trivia_man>	godginrai: is there a way of doing it without separating swap partitions?
<wasamasa>	old enough
<tom^>	wasamasa: i think its from the newest one
<wasamasa>	over two decades is fine by me
<tom^>	wasamasa: isnt it?
<wasamasa>	tom^: i don't know, didn't watch any of these
<godginrai>	trivia_man: not any way that would be easier.  the reason you need separate swap partitions is because the swap partition is where the state of the system gets stored.  if the systems were to share the same swap partition, then one would clobber the state of the other whenever the swap partition was used.
<beest>	a few 90s console games had us in space freighters with lasers by the year 2015, i take it with a grain of salt
<ekkelett>	linux 4.1.13, 4.1.14, 4.1.14.1, 4.1.14.2, 4.1.14.3, etc, tom^
<_ashbreeze_>	i have a suggestion for the arch gurus: don't release the latest kernel until the gcc version is released that it is compiled with... imho.
<spectre1>	hi there
<tibl>	lsmod shows the nouveau module loaded but the xf86-video-nouveau package isn't installed. do i need that package if the kernel already provides nouveau?
<beest>	yes
<tom^>	tibl: you need it for x yes.
<tom^>	_ashbreeze_: its in testing.
<beest>	that's the xorg driver, the module is in the kernel tree
<smirky>	tom^: yeah, but the kernel isnt
<trivia_man>	godginrai: i remember when i had windows and mint, i could easily just hibernate, then boot up windows, boot up mint the next day without losing any data.
<foutrelis>	_ashbreeze_: i read that there are issues with vmware, but i don't see why the gcc version would matter unless vmware itself has an overly strict check
<smirky>	tom^: ant it's compiled with 5.1
<tom^>	smirky: and it is?
<tom^>	*it is?
<tom^>	hm
<godginrai>	trivia_man: that's because windows and mint didn't share the same swap partition
<smirky>	tom^: if you have a linux-4 arch machine, dmesg|grep gcc
<tom^>	smirky: heh
<tibl>	oh hey, after installing the xorg nouveau package my xorg crashing problem disappears :o
<tom^>	weird huh
<tibl>	i have two video cards in my laptop
<ekkelett>	woah
<ekkelett>	that pacman update solved several things
<n00balert>	who's excited about .net coming to linux?
<cloudef>	what is .net?
<cloudef>	domain?
<tom^>	n00balert: since mono has existed for ages, not so much.
<n00balert>	lel
<ekkelett>	a) gnome-keyring stopped complaining when i started a tmux session b) wpa_supplicant once again worked with netctl-auto (but that wasn't one of the bugs, was it, foutrelis?) and c) it seems .xresources got loaded too!
<ekkelett>	no more xrdb -load .xresources.
<tibl>	i saw the lines in xorg.0.log where nouveau wasn't found so maybe firefox requested the faster card and it tried calling into a function exist? ¯\(°_o)/¯ can speculate all day long
<spectre1>	.net it's a programation languges use by microsoft
<tibl>	it was a reproducible, consistent crash. not happening anymore :d
<demize>	.net is a framework, not a language.
<n00balert>	gp
<canolucas>	hi. after updating to linux 4.0 along with the latest linux-firmware, whenever i reboot, my notebook sometimes boots to gnome, but sometimes it doesn't. journalctl shows that x is throwing a segmentation fault at address 0x0. you can find the most relevant lines at http://openpaste.org/fc61f9cf
<foutrelis>	ekkelett: wpa_supplicant segfaulting would explain wpa_actiond's error message and thus netctl-auto not working
<canolucas>	hope you can help me sort it out. thanks!
<tom^>	canolucas: server error at the paste
<tom^>	nvm worked now.
<xexaxo>	tibl: don't think that ff can request a fast/slow/etc driver. i would assume that the fallback driver used instead of nouveau was leading to the crash.
<n00balert>	the good folks at gnutl can suck it
<n00balert>	jk :)
<n00balert>	gnutls rather
<tibl>	xexaxo: hmm sounds like a possibility
<ekkelett>	foutrelis: fair enough -- i thought it was odd it worked with wifi-menu though, and that maybe there was another bug that also caused a segfault
<tom^>	canolucas: add nomodeset to the kernel cmd
<tom^>	canolucas: or well thats gonna bork kms, what gpu and driver are you using?
<xexaxo>	tibl: important part is that it works now. although if you're bothered enough you can always open a bug or try to hack up a fix :)
<ekkelett>	tibl: seems like it could be trying to use hw acceleration for the website
<ekkelett>	still odd with how it happened at ctrl+f. :p
<canolucas>	tom^: my notebook has an intel core i5 with intel ironlake mobile gpu. i'm using xf86-video-intel
<canolucas>	tom^: which worked til the update
<canolucas>	tom^: in mkinitcpio, i have the following modules. maybe this helps: modules="intel_agp drm i915"
<godginrai>	when exactly did linux 4.0 get in core?  i updated yesterday and am still on 3.19

<godginrai>	tom^: i checked that, and it said that 4.0 has been around for weeks, which didn't make sense
<namarrgon>	4.0 was never in [core], 4.0.1 is now
<godginrai>	i see
<willer>	i'm getting libva-mesa-driver-git: /usr/lib/dri/gallium_drv_video.so exists in filesystem installing mesa-git
<thrice>	well, what owns that file?
<willer>	libva-mesa-driver
<thrice>	does it have the appropriate replaces/provides in the pkgbuild?

<ihre>	thats my buildlog :p
<godginrai>	kyusaki: i haven't used packer, so i can't give you a comparison... but i can give you reasons to eschew yaourt
<scimmia>	godginrai, i'd love to hear them
<godginrai>	witquicked|l: the noise is what makes it so nice
<witquicked|l>	godginrai: not when i'm on a conference call with a bunch of people
<witquicked|l>	ihre: that's a beautiful build
<godginrai>	scimmia: 1) encourages editing pkgbuilds during install 2) the author himself suggests an installation method that completely avoids learning anything about how to use makepkg
<godginrai>	witquicked|l: mute does wonders
<scimmia>	1) is actually good, not bad. 2) is not a yaourt problem
<lexvegas>	if i get a kernel update from pacman, do i need to update grub, or is that not needed?
<grawity>	lexvegas: nope, the configuration does not change
<godginrai>	scimmia: it's a problem with the author.  if you can't trust him to give you good advice, why would you trust his software that is related to it?
<lexvegas>	grawity: thanks!
<scimmia>	godginrai, judge the software, not the person. if there is one takeaway from systemd, it's that
<witquicked|l>	godginrai: mute is a code smell for conference calls
<godginrai>	witquicked|l: not really... mute prevents background noise so that everyone can focus on the speaker
<braindamage>	godginrai: the inventor of the transistor was a strong proponent of eugenics and sterilization of unfit people, would you switch back to tubes because of that?
<grawity>	scimmia: generally true, though software does say something about the author's skills in that specific area
<godginrai>	braindamage: except eugenics is not related to transistors.  suggesting you skip learning makepkg is directly related to your understanding of the aur, which yaourt is intended to be a helper for.
<braindamage>	sounds a bit contrasting tough, first you say it encourages editing, then it doesn't?
<scimmia>	grawity, what does it say? that his ideas are slightly different than yours"?
<scimmia>	godginrai, again, judge the work
<scimmia>	there is a lot of yaourt hate, and nearly nobody knows why they hate it. it's just "cool" to hate it
<godginrai>	braindamage: no.  i said that it encouraged editing pkgbuilds during install and that it discouraged using makepkg
<godginrai>	braindamage: if you can't understand the first, then you obviously have not used yaourt
<braindamage>	i have used yaourt, and i know it prompts to edit pkgbuilds when you install something from the aur
<wget>	pffff. my cypress trackpad isn't working anymore with the kernel 4.0 update :-(
<scimmia>	braindamage, why is that bad?
<braindamage>	scimmia: i was about to ask the same thing
<witquicked|l>	godginrai: yes really... using mute as a tool to mute background noise when there is a central speaker makes sense, but when you're in a group conversation, mute becomes an impediment to communication. i don't have any science to back me up on this. i do have a lot of experience with evidence to support my opinion...
<scimmia>	braindamage, sorry, meant to highliight godginrai  there
<godginrai>	scimmia: because you should be doing your package research before you are in the middle of an install
<witquicked|l>	scimmia, braindamage - because inspecting the pkgbuild before doing the install is the recommended recipe
<scimmia>	godginrai, and so do it
<scimmia>	prompting if you want to take a look and make changes doesn't mean you can't look at it before
<braindamage>	i do it at the same time
<braindamage>	i open the pkgbuild file, and do research starting from there
<godginrai>	scimmia: but by encouraging you to edit mid-install, you won't get in that hapbit.  also, making the changes on the fly like that is more likely to lead to problems caused by simple typos
<braindamage>	mid install? the install hasn't started yet until you quit the editing program and actually confirm
<scimmia>	godginrai, ah, so the issue is that they aren't forcing people into your specific workflow?
<dawnson>	i am in germany and i want to buy a cheap but good looking laptop for archlinux with wayland support, any recommendations?
<dawnson>	i prefer intel cpu and either intel or nvidia graphics
<godginrai>	witquicked|l: in a group conversation, especially one that is not in person, it is a lot harder to pay attention to 2 people talking at the same time.  it still makes sense to mute
<godginrai>	scimmia: not at all.  it's that they encourage bad practices
<braindamage>	dawnson: nvidia has no official driver for wayland as of yet
<dawnson>	budget is about 2-500€, preferably between 10 and 13"
<grawity>	dawnson: by "wayland support" you basically mean you want a graphics card that works well with the open-source kms drivers
<dawnson>	braindamage: hm ok. and the intel ones seem to be bugged currently
<gnoze5>	yellow
<scimmia>	godginrai, so what should they do, have a prompt asking if you've already looked at the pkgbuild?
<smirky>	nvidia and wayland don't go well atm
<smirky>	if at all
<scimmia>	yaourt is a tool, it's up to you how you use it
<witquicked|l>	godginrai: i should write up my findings about muting vs not using mute in group conference callls
<dawnson>	on my intel nuc i can start weston when x is already running but directly starting weston does not work
<godginrai>	scimmia: if someone chooses a bad practice on their own, then that's their problem.  but if they choose it due to the influence of the software they are using, then that's a problem with the software
<dawnson>	so: 10-13" laptop with intel graphics for 3-500€ that looks good. preferably ssd.
<sysgh0st>	dawnson: why wayland? i had the understanding that wayland is far from usable for everyday use.
<witquicked|l>	godginrai: cuz i used to hold that same opinion and have come to a different conclusion in the last several years
<scimmia>	godginrai, i think your definition of "encourage" is different than mine
<smirky>	sysgh0st: it is, he doesn't know that though
<godginrai>	witquicked|l: be sure to include experiments with push-to-talk in those findings
<dawnson>	sysgh0st: because i want to
<dawnson>	:d
<dawnson>	it is just for messing around
<scimmia>	godginrai, yaourt doesn't "encourage" anything. they give you the tools to determine your own workflow
<dawnson>	i like my nuc but i want to take with me so i need a laptop
<godginrai>	scimmia: asking you if you would like to edit the pkgbuild mid-install encourages such practices
<braindamage>	dawnson: it's kinda strange you want a dedicated machine just to mess around with experimental sw :s
<scimmia>	godginrai, if you're that weak willed that you can't just say "no", that's not the software's problem
<dawnson>	braindamage: why?
<scimmia>	godginrai, those people wouldn't have looked at the pkgbuild beforehand, anyway
<braindamage>	dawnson: because it costs money, and the situation is still very early re: support
<dawnson>	i like how that looks :d http://papyros.io/ but could not get it to work yet as well
<phrik>	title: papyros (at papyros.io)
<dawnson>	braindamage: well its my money :p
<braindamage>	things might change relatively soon, so you might end up wasting said money
<dawnson>	and i can still user it with x if i want to
<sysgh0st>	dawnson: well.. in that case you pretty much answered your own question. use a well known gpu that have some support for wayland. but it may only be in alpha... or in best cases, beta stage.
<godginrai>	scimmia: many would not have, sure.  but this still encourages making quick hotfixes to pkgbuilds in the install process rather than actually thinking things through and making an informed fix.
<braindamage>	yeah, sure, i just commented it's strange, i'm not trying to prevent you to spend them, you asked to elaborate :p
<dawnson>	i dont know much about laptops other than macbooks and i need one that will generally work well with archlinux and was hoping someone has a recommendation
<scimmia>	godginrai, again, that's the user's fault. blaming the software for user's decisions if folly
<hiptobecubic>	i have a t430 that works pretty nicely
<godginrai>	scimmia: if you enable a killer by giving them a weapon, you are just as much to blame as the killer
<utack>	http://www.linlap.com/ was ok last i checked
<teraflop>	^
<hiptobecubic>	the accelerometer-based hdd protection probably doesn't work, but i don' thave an hdd so i don't know or care
<scimmia>	godginrai, they were a killer to start with, they were already going to kill
<hiptobecubic>	it definitely worked on the t420
<dawnson>	utack: that website looks horrible and like it was out of date in 1998
<scimmia>	godginrai, you giving them a weapon made no difference
<hiptobecubic>	why do you want to upgrade your t420 anyway?
<godginrai>	scimmia: they can only kill if they are given the means to.  by providing them the means, you are just as much at fault
<scimmia>	godginrai, bullshit.
<braindamage>	scimmia: your convo is quickòy devolving to philosophy :p
<dawnson>	i would have gone with a sony vaio but they dont get made anymore :(
<disappointment>	hm, weird, when monitor connected with hdmi goes to sleep it will not wake up unless i switch to varrious tty's multiple times, using nouveau btw.
<sysgh0st>	dawnson: afaik, intel is the one gpu maker that has the "best" wayland support for now. i'm not sure how a;d/ati is doing. nvidia is .... well... i have no idea actually.
<scimmia>	godginrai, if they don't have a gun, they use a knife. if they don't have a knife, they strangle the victim
<utack>	dawnson th listed devices are ok, but it is far from complete
<hiptobecubic>	i would probably avoid small shops selling "linux" laptops. they will certainly work but if you ever need to buy replacement parts then what?
<scimmia>	godginrai, blaming the tool is a joke
<dawnson>	hmmm wasnt there a relatively new dell unit that even gets shipped with ubuntu?
<braindamage>	nvidia officially stated for a while they wouldn't support wayland, not sure if they changed their mind recently
<teraflop>	dawnson: i'd pick intel gpu for doing wayland righ now
<braindamage>	nouveau is a separate thing
<hiptobecubic>	i'd pick intel gpu for anything other than gaming
<dawnson>	teraflop: yeah thats what i'm going for
<teraflop>	hiptobecubic: yeah
<hiptobecubic>	and even there, it's not terrible
<dawnson>	i wouldnt pick linux for gaming either :p
<dawnson>	unfortunately
<disappointment>	ubuntu causes a girl to drop out of college
<dawnson>	i hope steamos does change that in the future
<sysgh0st>	hiptobecubic: doesn't that come back with pretty much every laptop? they aren't exactly modular. in best cases one can switch cpu, wifi and ram modules. i worst case only the ram can be upgraded.
<hiptobecubic>	damn, linlap has to have the slowest servers of any page i've tried to visit in the last year
<braindamage>	sysgh0st: my laptop's gpu is modular
<godginrai>	scimmia: people are easily influenced by options presented to them.  if you present them options that seem "easy", they will latch onto them.  even if they are bad practices.
<sysgh0st>	braindamage: ah.. dell?
<braindamage>	no, santech
<dawnson>	hmmm the xps13 is 899... a bit over budget for something i dont really need
<sysgh0st>	that is impressive. though dell was the onlly manufacturer with modular gpu.
<dawnson>	but the hardware would be perfect
<scimmia>	godginrai, so your answer is to blame the tool. i can't help you
<sysgh0st>	...but then it can only be switched out withing a very narrow series of gpus.
<godginrai>	scimmia: if a tool encourages bad practices, it should be replaced with a tool that encourages less or no bad practices
<iit_>	what is a method to update the config files ?
<braindamage>	sysgh0st: actually the socket it uses on my laptop is a vendor-agnostic standard: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mobile_pci_express_module
<phrik>	title: mobile pci express module - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (at en.wikipedia.org)
<iit_>	last time i had not updated anything and messed my arch install
<scimmia>	godginrai, again, it doesn' t "encourage" anything. i simply gives you options. you think users who know what they're doing should have less options because some idiot might abuse it?
<braindamage>	sysgh0st: howrever the amount of graphic boards available is indeed limited
<disappointment>	godginrai: what about dynamite, which was used in wars to kill people, but also in mines to bring prosperity, what did dynamite encourage?
<scimmia>	godginrai, we might as well all be using gnome
<godginrai>	scimmia: but *when* it gives you the options is what encourages the bad practices
<scimmia>	godginrai, because other wms "encourage" bad things by allowing them
<sysgh0st>	the idea of the mxm cards are great, but the limitations makes it crippled.
<saivert>	okay server back online
<scimmia>	godginrai, i think it comes down to your basic philosophy that people should be controlled
<teraflop>	daemon stop rofl http://a.pomf.se/dpvzkh.png
<braindamage>	sysgh0st: care to elaborate?
<saivert>	i received a logitech usb audio adapter today. listed as logitech clearchat pro
<cupantae>	oh yeah hey sysgh0st by the way, did you get through that issue you had with your bootup?
<saivert>	it seems to exhibit a cut off around 27,5 db where it goes to silence
<godginrai>	disappointment: i didn't say that something couldn't be misused.  but this is more like if the dynamite came with a label saying "you can destroy rocks or blow up people!"
<saivert>	-27,5db that is
<saivert>	volume level as reported by pa
<hiptobecubic>	godginrai, this is not a productive angle for you to take. claiming that flexibility encourages bad practices pretty much flies in the face of "the arch way" as a whole
<cupantae>	i was just going to suggest (re)installing systemd-readahead and i think cups?
<iit_>	best tool for managing .pacnew files ?
<hiptobecubic>	we might as well all just use ipads
<cupantae>	sysgh0st: to make sure those service files actually are there
<treferwynd>	are you talking about gun control or you're way too deep in a metaphor?
<braindamage>	treferwynd: latter
<scimmia>	godginrai, give me a break, that analogy is so far outside the scope of this discussion it's laughable.
<godginrai>	scimmia: actually, considering that i had to relate it to dynamite, it fits this situation quite well.
<treferwynd>	braindamage: thanks
<scimmia>	godginrai, you really think that comparing using yaourt to blowing up people with dynamite is a good analogy? wow
<xt1ger>	what did i miss here?
<godginrai>	hiptobecubic: giving 2 choices at a particular point of a process doesn't exactly encourage flexibility as much as it encourages performing an action at that point in time
<cupantae>	xt1ger: there was a bomb scare in the channel.
<xt1ger>	oooh shit
<cupantae>	as much as 1tb of damage.
<godginrai>	scimmia: i'm not comparing "yaourt" to blowing up people.  i am encouraging the choice to use a bad practice to blowing up people.  yaourt in this analogy would be the label.
<scimmia>	godginrai, again, you keep using "encourages", if you're that weak willed, that's your problem, not the software's
<godginrai>	s/encouraging/comparing
<sysgh0st>	braindamage: ah.. my fault. mistook the mxm card with another type of modular gpu that didn't have onboard vram.
<xt1ger>	my homenetwork got ddos'd the whole week from adresses of varous big hosters around the world atacking port 19
<xt1ger>	lucky me uses arch^^
<foutrelis>	wtf uses port 19?
<godginrai>	scimmia: blowing up people is dynamite's equivalent of a "bad practice"
<scimmia>	godginrai, ok, so in this ridiculous analogy of yours, that label might be offensive, but do you think that someone would see that an think "hey, maybe i *should* use it to blow people up!"

<octocpp>	is there a way to search for a package by text in the comment section using pacman?
<sysgh0st>	cupantae: i'm still looking into it. had other things getting in the way. but i suspect i got a broken file system on the computer in question.
<namarrgon>	octocpp: pacman -ss
<octocpp>	namarrgon:  i thought that only searched in the package name string?
<disappointment>	octocpp: it searches both.
<octocpp>	disappointment: ahh, great, thanks
<octocpp>	namarrgon: thanks
<shapeshifter>	soo many power saving options. what should i use? any recommendations? do i really have to wade through individual options?
<godginrai>	scimmia: no, but that's because common ethics would suggest it is wrong.  common ethics do not currently have any effect on computer usage.  if everyone had best practices for the aur as common knowledge before using yaourt, i'm sure you would see much less people editing the pkgbuild when given that option.  but these practices are *not* common knowledge, and thus users do not know better.
<shapeshifter>	pm-utils, tlp, laptopmode-tools...
<shapeshifter>	someone posted some scripts at some point
<scimmia>	godginrai, i answer yes to that question more often that not, does that make me a bad person?
<cupantae>	sysgh0st: that's grand. you just left very quickly last time, i thought i'd say my bit anyway :)
<scimmia>	godginrai, and again i'll say that the tool is not to blame for someone's bad practices
<godginrai>	scimmia: bad person, no.  but do i believe you are using bad practices? yes.
<scimmia>	godginrai, they you're an idiot
<scimmia>	s/they/then
<namarrgon>	godginrai: scimmia: i think it's fine now, most people already lost interest
<cupantae>	scimmia, godginrai: can you two actually stop this, it's really annoying and neither one is going to convince the other
<scimmia>	you're making wild assumptions about me
<holomorph>	what is this conversation about
<cupantae>	holomorph: oh don't, please.
<disappointment>	scimmia, godginrai: i personally think that we live in a free world (mostly), so everybody should be allowed to use wtf he/she wants.
<holomorph>	cupantae: d:
<sysgh0st>	cupantae: yeah.. sorry about that. work suddenly *popped* up on my desk.
<godginrai>	scimmia: when did i make an assumption about you?
<cupantae>	sysgh0st: no bother at all
<scimmia>	godginrai, that the only reason for that option is "bad practices"
<scimmia>	godginrai, ever think that there may be a trivial change that needs to be made? or a final check to make sure the pkgbuild is the same as the last time you checked it?
<sysgh0st>	cupantae: if you have any ideas where else to look i'd be happy. i'm not so sure the logs are telling everything. i suspect they just happen to stop at those particular spots due to some other deeper fault.
<godginrai>	scimmia: that is not an assumption about you.  and just because you can do something non-toxic with a feature does not mean that it is not bad practice to use said feature.
<scimmia>	godginrai, features cannot be "toxic"
<scimmia>	see, you're blaming the tool again
<cupantae>	sysgh0st: yes i think you're right there. nonetheless though, it was reporting missing files, so making it so the errors are gone is a decent place to start
<namarrgon>	scimmia: godginrai are you guys listening? #archlinux-offtopic is this way ->
<cupantae>	in fact, since cups and readahead aren't boot-necessary, you could try disabling them
<scimmia>	namarrgon, except this is very on topic
<godginrai>	scimmia: i didn't say that the feature was "toxic".  you are putting words into my mouth
<namarrgon>	scimmia: nobody give a fuck about that shit, you two are the only ones continuing
<cupantae>	godginrai, scimmia: /msg theotherguy more flaming
<holomorph>	!thestinger
<cupantae>	we don't need to listen to this shit
<phrik>	https://xkcd.com/386/
<scimmia>	by saying that you "can do something non-toxic" directly implies that it is inherently toxic
<godginrai>	cupantae: i'd love for you to point out where i flamed anyone here
<scimmia>	namarrgon, i don't care
<cupantae>	godginrai: stfu
<disappointment>	irc drama season v episode 312
<godginrai>	scimmia: it was meant to imply that any feature can be misused, and that if you provide a feature that has an increased likelihood of misuse, then it is a feature that should be avoided.  or at least gated behind some setting so that only those who are aware of what they are doing will enable it
<sysgh0st>	cupantae: i suspected so as well. i know that cups changed the naming on many of its systemd files, so that one was some leftovers from old versions. i didn't go though that update in a proper way. and that read ahead seems to be completely gone. i will remove it from systemd.
<nyomaszto>	how do i change default meta key in emacs?
<scimmia>	godginrai, and there's where we strongly disagree. removing a feature because there is the possibility of misuse goes against everything arch and linux in general stand for
<foutrelis>	godginrai, scimmia: sirs, have a bunny: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfgt1z2_clu
<phrik>	title: bunny eating lettuce - youtube (at www.youtube.com)
<sysgh0st>	cupantae: i'll keep looking for why. i also suspect a kernel module to taint the kernel, and in some cases cause it to panic.
<godginrai>	scimmia: you ignored my second sentence.  i am completely fine with it being gated behind a setting.  but it should not be default behavior
<scimmia>	godginrai, are you a gnome user?
<scimmia>	i've got to know
<godginrai>	scimmia: no.  i actually hate gnome
<disappointment>	foutrelis: +1
<godginrai>	scimmia: you should know i use e
<scimmia>	godginrai, ok, just curious. this really seems like the philosophy of gnome
<scimmia>	godginrai, you're right, i should have known that. sorry
<sysgh0st>	cupantae: be back soon. more work poped up ;)
<scimmia>	unfortunately, i have to get going, too

<rabit>	disappointment seems disappointmented
<godginrai>	also, bunnies are cute until they yawn

<noctlos>	hey, i have a problem with an ovmf guest image. i wrote about it here: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1524772#p1524772. does anyone have an idea how i can solve this issue?
<phrik>	title: windows guest vm in qemu with ovmf freezing on boot / applications & desktop environments / arch linux forums (at bbs.archlinux.org)
<octocpp>	ifim on kde4 right now, would i need to install qtcurve-qt4 and or qtcurve-qt5 in addition to qtcurve-kde4?
<tu34>	hello. i need to change my disk type gpt, if i backup my system files with rsync and replace them after install the system on gpt, will i have problem?
<godginrai>	noctlos: why are you using qemu?
<tu34>	config files etc. same on gpt and on mbr. aren't they?
<braindamage>	tu34: you'll have to change the uuid in fstab
<braindamage>	other than that, as long as you preserve the fs attributes, you should be fine
<noctlos>	godginrai: for kvm + vga passthrough
<tu34>	everything are fine, just i have to change fstab? if i backup /etc except fstab, problem will be solved, i guess
<godginrai>	a normal vm can't access kvm and vga?
<saivert>	qemu is kvm dummy
<saivert>	kernel virtual machine
<tu34>	okay, thank you.
<tu34>	and another thing, i've clean my pacman cache. so can i backup my packages?
<noctlos>	thanks, saivert
<tu34>	the built-in option to remove all the cached packages that are not currently installed is:
<tu34>	yes i can :)
<octocpp>	tu34:  i would back up everything even the fstab, but you will have to change the uuid of the partitions on that drive  referenced in fstab since it will change the uuid of them in the system.
<tu34>	octocpp: okay, i get it. thank you
<aryklein>	i've configured my network interface with networkd and i have success, but if i perform "systemctl stop systemd-networkd.service " network interfaces still configured. why?
<octocpp>	tu34: assuming there may be changes you made in there that you dont want to lose or something.
<godginrai>	tu34: did you just figure out the answer to your pacman question on your own?
<teraflop>	!give aryklein systemctl stop
<phrik>	aryklein: http://a.pomf.se/dpvzkh.png
<tu34>	godgrai: indeed.
<godginrai>	k, just making sure

<entity>	holyshit holyshit holyshit, linux 4 is in the repositories
<entity>	why no website announcement? shouldn't i be worried?
<disappointment>	entity: since yesterday
<godginrai>	entity: i was wondering as well why there wasn't a post in the news
<entity>	last time i tried linux 4, it killed my ssd drive
<disappointment>	it's because linux 4.0 isn't anything revolutionary.
<disappointment>	it's just another version.
<xt1ger>	updated to it, boots fine
<godginrai>	you'd think "linux 4" might be a change people might need to know about
<entity>	so i'm a bit worried about this
<xt1ger>	dont be
<xt1ger>	works for me
<xt1ger>	and shave 0,2 secs off my boot time
<iit_>	xt1ger, which ditro ?
<godginrai>	i updated right before it got pushed to repos yesterday
<godginrai>	so i'll probably just wait to update and see how it shakes out with other users
<xt1ger>	iit_: vanilla arch
<iit_>	i am also on arch
<godginrai>	iit_: i should hope so?
<xt1ger>	iit_: youre in the arch irc:)
<iit_>	yeah :d
<gehidore>	godginrai: i've been running mainline which was 4.0-rc* for 2 months or more... no problems
<godginrai>	gehidore: sure.  but i have no need to update so soon after just updating.  by giving it a couple of days, i ensure that any problems anyone *does* have will likely have shown up in the places i read to inform myself about any problems i may experience.

<bellbreaker>	any breakage to expect when upgrading the kernel?
<iit_>	pls anyone ?
<namarrgon>	vimdiff
<sudokode>	you're upgrading the one thing that allows you to talk to your hardware
<sudokode>	expect breakage
<tomty89>	eh why (lib32-)libpulse optdep on (lib32-)alsa-plugins
<iit_>	namarrgon, ok, installing it
<bellbreaker>	god damnit sudokode, i just needed someone to hug me and tell me everything was going to be all right
<sudokode>	gotta rip the bandage off some time
<charlesatum>	well, you sure have the arch livecd lying arround, right?
<namarrgon>	iit_: i hope you know some vim then. some seem to like meld (if you're after a gui)
<sudokode>	while we're at it, the tooth fairy isn't real
<bellbreaker>	you're crushing my reality
<bellbreaker>	stahp
<sudokode>	:>
<iit_>	namarrgon, yeah familiar with vim, but found pacnews-git and installed it, running it shows nothing which means all my files are good ?
<entity>	i think i'll wait ntil the live cd gets updated to 4.x as well
<entity>	so just in case, i can install 4 then anyway
<braindamage>	speaking of diff, is there any console alternative to vimdiff? my search fu is failing me
<sudokode>	why would you want an alternative to vimdiff when vimdiff is awesome>?
<sudokode>	that's like me giving you a $100 bill and you asking me for a crisper note
<braindamage>	because no matter how many times i tried i cannot get used to vim paradigm
<abrarsyed>	there is meld if you want a gtk app for it... can also use diff alone. but no alternative to vimdiff that i know of...
<namarrgon>	iit_: i don't know about "pacnews", either run pacdiff or find /etc -iname '*.pacnew'
<iit_>	shows no file :)
<endre>	hey ppl, is it safe in arch linux to remove python3? i fear of the system component dependecies
<braindamage>	core doesn't depend on it, but many things on top of it do
<homerj>	why would you remove it?
<tomty89>	endre: if you can pacman -r
<junka>	endre; upon removal, pacman will tell you if any apps have it as a dependancy
<endre>	thanks :)
<tomty89>	endre: python3 ftw
<abrarsyed>	or you can do pacman -rc python3    and actually see the nice massive list of things that would get removed because they depend on python
<endre>	gyp err! stack error: python executable "python" is v3.4.3, which is not supported by gyp.
<iit_>	how can i know "pacdiffviewer" is installed by which package ?
<endre>	yeah
<tomty89>	endre: wat
<homerj>	if you have something that's screwing up because it's running python3 and not python2, that's an issue with that program, not that you have python3
<endre>	sure it is
<asem>	hi, where can i request a package to be promoted to stable? , i am talking about tzdata , i dont think it needs testing and it can effect people if its not updated soon
<abrarsyed>	endre, if thats something to do with nodejs.. just add this to the end:  --python=python2
<braindamage>	iit_: pkgfile
<endre>	i know i know
<tomty89>	endre: change it bit of it should already fix it
<endre>	anyway, python _3_ just causes this annoyances all the time
<iit_>	braindamage, no that package is not installed yet
<tomty89>	wrong logic
<endre>	i see no benefit of having python3 installed when python2 is there
<braindamage>	iit_: then do it
<iit_>	braindamage, but i already have pacdiffviewer
<tomty89>	endre: lazy dev who doesn't update their code causes anonyance all the time
<endre>	:d
<braindamage>	iit_: pkgfile searches packages which provide said path
<endre>	:: libreoffice-still: requires python>=3.4
<endre>	o noes
<tomty89>	oh yay
<junka>	oh pls
<endre>	abandoned idea

<iit_>	braindamage, sorry i am not getting
<c0ffee_>	happy bluetooth keyboard users here, without any issues? is it my system or bluez5 doesn't reconnect keyboard properly?
<iit_>	c0ffee_, i am on bluetooth keyboard no prob at all :)
<holomorph>	endre: `pactree -r python`
<braindamage>	iit_: how can i know "pacdiffviewer" is installed by which package ?  -> pkgfile will tell you which package provides pacdiffviewer
<endre>	holomorph: nice, thanks
<c0ffee_>	iit_: and your keyboard turns itself off in a while to save power, then reconnects just fine?
<tomty89>	python2
<tomty89>	└─smbclient
<tomty89>	eww
<c0ffee_>	my keyboard is displayed as 'connected' in bluetoothctl, but keys work only after few 'power on' 'power off' in bluetoothctl?
<iit_>	braindamage, ok got thw whole thing, i just miss-understood :d
<iit_>	c0ffee_, yes perfectly fine

<tomty89>	sure
<tomty89>	it's really complicated to me though
<n00balert>	it is

<e^0>	doing for the first time system backup
<e^0>	n00balert: haha
<earnestly>	so do it
<earnestly>	just do it
<earnestly>	yes, rsync can do it, so can `cp` or even `dd` whatever.  you could even use `cat`
<gehidore>	rsync and tar both offer super easy backup methods...
<gehidore>	^^ nice earnestly
<n00balert>	cat lol
<earnestly>	just investigate it and do it, see what happens
<earnestly>	only way you will figure it out
<n00balert>	not tar...cat

<earnestly>	setup a smaller test case
<e^0>	ok
<earnestly>	include acl changes, xattrs, etc.
<azalus88>	n00balert: lol. i actually have considered that
<azalus88>	earnestly: should i resize from a gparted livecd?
<n00balert>	azalus88: depends on your boot loader - boot arch and destroy ubuntu
<earnestly>	you should maybe read?
<e^0>	earnestly: i am going to use the backup script  mentioned over here https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/full_system_backup_with_tar, which will "include acl changes, xattrs, etc." ?
<earnestly>	fuck this
<azalus88>	n00balert: i guess i am mostly concerned about removing ubuntu and screwing up my grub (which is what i am using)
<e^0>	earnestly: ? than what i am suppose to use
<earnestly>	e^0: you're supposed to quit irc and just do things
<n00balert>	earnestly: but this is more fun
<e^0>	earnestly: hehe ok moving forward with that thing. :)
<godginrai>	e^0: think trial by fire.  if something goes wrong, you'll learn from it.  if everything goes right, you'll feel that much more proud.
<oozbooz>	azalus88, after removing ubuntu... live boot arch, mount arch partitions under /mnt, chroot and rerun grub
<e^0>	godginrai: yeah right :) living in the wild
<n00balert>	that would do
<godginrai>	oozbooz: you mean rerun grub-mkconfig?
<oozbooz>	can you have two eufi partitions, wins and arch, on the same disks? or does arch boot have to live on first eufi partition?
<supergeek800>	how does one fix x starting up in 1024x768 (on an hdtv) and not giving the user any control whatsoever (on lxdm, downgraded to linux-lts, so it boots again, just can't access the system).
<supergeek800>	*?
<n00balert>	no, you probably have to rewrite mbr
<azalus88>	oozbooz: i assume i mount arch / under /mnt and the efi part under /mnt/boot?
<n00balert>	it feels weird saying mbr
<oozbooz>	goddesen, i meant ... find out what grub commands to run to redo mrb and image
<godginrai>	oozbooz: there is only one thing you can really call a "uefi partition", and that's the esp.  and you only ever have one of those.
<n00balert>	oozbooz: simple answer is no
<supergeek800>	tbh, considering just doing a reinstall, since i have 20gb to back up my music and emulated game roms.

<n00balert>	you're the god
<oozbooz>	goddesen, n00balert ... but having /dev/sda with uefi and uefi-usb both mounted is fine
<godginrai>	oozbooz: what are you using that calls your partition "uefi"?
<n00balert>	oozbooz: right but they're mutually exclusive
<supergeek800>	which if i do have to do a reinstall, /dev/sda4 should be the 20gb partition, so after my stuff is backed up, i won't mess with that partition, but i'll reinstall on the pre-existing /boot, /, and /swap partitions, if that's doable.
<oozbooz>	godginrai, i have gpt partitioned /dev/sda with uefi partion from ms windows
<supergeek800>	which the boot partition size is 50mb, which should be way more than the kernel needs.
<godginrai>	oozbooz: if those are the esps, then that's because they are separate media.  there is no "windows" or "linux" esp
<godginrai>	just the esp
<n00balert>	oozbooz: and windows 'own' the esp
<tomty89>	one esp per disk
<tomty89>	n00balert: nooo
<saivert>	i'm glad we are informed
<godginrai>	if you are trying to figure out how to dual-boot linux and windows with uefi, you would install your bootloader (gummiboot, for example) to the esp, and then let that handle booting into windows or linux
<tomty89>	n00balert: you own the esp
<tomty89>	n00balert: because you own the disk
<n00balert>	godginrai: i could never get it to work
<n00balert>	tomty89: lel...corporations own me, my disks and my phone
<stendarpaval>	hi there
<tomty89>	but maybe windows own a bootx64.efi there...
<n00balert>	if anyone has it working please show us
<tomty89>	what working?
<tomty89>	uefi?
<oozbooz>	so when arch wiki for dual boot, says run grub-install ... $esp ... that means mount ms windows created uefi partition and adding grub there?
<n00balert>	dual boot uefi arch+win
<tomty89>	!everyone
<treferwynd>	n00balert: *show em boobs*
<saivert>	the easiest route is to install windows first. in the installer of windows, when you are at the partitioning step, just delete all partitions. then create a new partition making sure you leave space for the linux one. it will then tell you it will create extra partitions to make sure the system boots. this includes esp, a recovery partition, a reserved partition and the windows partition itself. the rest
<saivert>	of the space is then free for linux. now you install linux, creating only the additional partitions you want for use with linux. put gummiboot in the esp that windows installer created for you.
<tomty89>	oozbooz: yup
<chjj>	the easiest route is to not install windows.
<n00balert>	tomty89: and what happens when windows gets updated?
<s00pcan>	chjj: ues
<s00pcan>	yes
<treferwynd>	n00balert: from 8 to 8.1 breaks everything
<treferwynd>	after that it's fine
<s00pcan>	my ideal setup is a vm of windows running in arch host
<n00balert>	there is a part of you that dies inside...a tiny part that wanted dual boot so bad
<tomty89>	n00balert: actually as long as you don't use --removable with grub-install and have a entry written in the nvm, it should be fine
<thurstylark>	i'm having trouble with launching minecraft on a fresh install. this is the crash report: http://pastie.org/10121566 would anyone be able to help me figure this out?
<phrik>	title: #10121566 - pastie (at pastie.org)
<tomty89>	gummiboot might have conflict though, idk
<oozbooz>	tomty89, windows and linux bits will co-exist on the same partition? .. scary..
<cloudef>	i run windows in my blood
<tomty89>	i'm not sure what path/way windows use to have the efi binary
<saivert>	why would upgrading windows touch the gummiboot?
<tomty89>	s/binary/executable
<n00balert>	saivert: it touches esp
<godginrai>	n00balert: could never get what to work?
<n00balert>	because 'windows own esp'
<saivert>	it doesn't wipe the esp and reinstall windows bootloader there
<tomty89>	because boot/efi/bootx64.efi is a de facto standard?
<treferwynd>	saivert: that's actually what happed to me from 8 to 8.1
<tomty89>	i don't know if windows use that
<saivert>	boot/efi/bootx64.efi is just the fallback path if no nvram entry is set
<saivert>	gummiboot install creates its own nvram entry
<n00balert>	godginrai: uh
<treferwynd>	*happened, dams
<tomty89>	okay de facto fallback
<saivert>	so don't worry about the fallback. it isn't used in normal situations
<tomty89>	saivert: but gummiboot also install an executable with that path i think
<tomty89>	the thing is, whether windows use that fallback as their standard'
<saivert>	and windows does not use it. it creates a nvram entry pointing to bootmgfw.efi
<tomty89>	good
<tomty89>	good to hear
<godginrai>	n00balert: windows does not "own" the esp
<tomty89>	so we can use --removable with grub-install :d
<n00balert>	i call it 'owning' when you have no control over windows writing it during updates
<earnestly>	n00balert: just like linux owns it then
<saivert>	just make a backup of the entire esp before windows upgrade then if you are paranoid
<n00balert>	eh
<godginrai>	n00balert: then windows owns your whole harddrive
<n00balert>	earnestly: you have control in arch
<earnestly>	so do you in windows
<sysgh0st>	actually, with my windows 7 installation, the bootx64.efi is loaded from the esp partition. i know this due to modifications i've made to it. (which we're not talking about here *cough* ... look... a bird! *sneaks away* )
<saivert>	control is an illusion
<n00balert>	godginrai: no; and i think it's more to do with oem and shit...bios makers...
<godginrai>	n00balert: my point is that windows could just as easily completely overwrite your linux partition as it could overwrite the esp.  there's nothing stopping it.
<saivert>	now we have devolved into a philosophical debate again. typical #archlinux
<thurstylark>	how can i check to see if i have the best driver for my graphics card?
<earnestly>	saivert: except we haven't, only you are trying to do so
<saivert>	haha
<tomty89>	thurstylark: pacman -qs nvidia
<godginrai>	thurstylark: nvidia or amd?
<supergeek800>	meanwhile i'm just trying to find out a way to regain access to my system here now that it's bootable, but x, or maybe lxdm, is malfunctioning.
<saivert>	earnestly: so you are paying attention
<saivert>	good to know
<n00balert>	godginrai: pft...no sorry; 'windows updates' won't touch other drives...just esp
<saivert>	it was a test
<tomty89>	!g the way meant to be played
<phrik>	tomty89: the way its meant to be played | nvidia: <http://www.nvidia.com/object/nv_gdc2k2_02.html>
<saivert>	i feel like glados now. the villain in portal games
<thurstylark>	godginrai, tomty89: i'm pretty sure it's just intel graphics. i guess graphics 'card' would be the wrong term. it's a 2014 inspiron 15
<stendarpaval>	what's a normal size for the esp partition?
<earnestly>	saivert: except you don't have a captive audience and no one cares
<n00balert>	stendarpaval: depends who's answering
<tomty89>	thurstylark: sorry, you only have the worst driver in the world then
<stendarpaval>	well, i *think* mine's 452 mb
<thurstylark>	brilliant
<earnestly>	stendarpaval: depends on what you're using it for
<stendarpaval>	but my partitions are all over the place
<godginrai>	n00balert: windows is capable of doing anything it wants.  it has access to the drive.  you are the first person i have ever seen complain that windows *could* overwrite the esp during updates.  plenty of people here have been running dualboots without this happening to them.
<stendarpaval>	i only run win7 on this laptop
<saivert>	earnestly: are you getting cross with me?
<earnestly>	thurstylark: tomty89 talks out of his ass, usually
<tomty89>	:d

<kamal_>	here's an uncommon opinion: the arch wiki is *amazing*
<teraflop>	kamal_: spend some time here ...
<zeevo>	dae arch is le best distro? #uncommonopinions
<kamal_>	:p
<zeevo>	fuck arch
<nixnerd>	zeevo: lol
<teraflop>	he loves fuck so that phrase is a compliment
<nixnerd>	right. arch is so awesome... he wan't to fuck it. i get it.
<proshot>	you could somebody help me out, getting my wifi working
<rena>	ugh, i've been fighting with my own wifi
<jushur>	kamal_: i find it to be so that everything is amazing untill its not ;)
<proshot>	do not understand i reinstalled, and now the wifi is not working anymore
<jushur>	proshot: what is the problem?
<proshot>	well the wifi is not up
<proshot>	as if its not recognized
<jushur>	proshot: installed  hte firmware package?
<nixnerd>	proshot: what are you trying?
<proshot>	the firmware-pacage
<rena>	yo, so i was watching a movie in vlc and the whole machine froze up. journalctl shows mention of a gpu lockup and mention of a kernel null pointer dereference. where/how to send the report?
<rena>	i'm using radeon driver
<jushur>	proshot: dmesg says anything?
<proshot>	ehm no not yet,
<proshot>	let me have a look
<earnestly>	rena: ask #radeon
<rena>	alright. is it possibly also a kernel bug?
<earnestly>	rena: radeon is in the kernel
<rena>	ahh
<rena>	thanks
<earnestly>	(likely a page flip thing, these programs vlc (and even mpv) do pretty stupid things)
<rena>	yeah it's always gpu drivers giving me headache. at least with open-source driver i can report the problem
<rena>	(well, that and wifi :v)
<rena>	but my wifi woes are the fault of crappy routers
<earnestly>	proshot: check that the interface is actually present, see ip(8) (or ip-link(8))
<jushur>	this machine got issues with the framebuffer and powersave, like in login console. one time it can turn of monitor, seckond time the screen goes all dim white instead.
<proshot>	earnestly, the interface is not pressent
<earnestly>	proshot: how is it connected?
<proshot>	via ethernet
<earnestly>	no, i mean the interface
<proshot>	via enp1so
<proshot>	via enp1s0
<proshot>	that is
<earnestly>	also, i'm not sure how "via ethernet" really fits in with "wifi not working", but okay
<earnestly>	proshot: no, the physical nic
<earnestly>	how is it connected
<earnestly>	usb? pci?
<proshot>	oh, dunno for sure, its on a laptop
<earnestly>	probably pci, does lspci(1) show it?
<proshot>	ag 02:00.0 network controller: broadcom corporation bcm4313 802.11bgn wireless network adapter (rev 01)
<earnestly>	why am i not surprised it's a broadcom
<proshot>	broadcom, that explains a lot, always problems with these cards
<proshot>	one second, have to make some coffee, to digest this broadcom news
<jonimus>	i must be lucky because i've never had an issue with a broadcom card :/
<jonimus>	then again all of my cards have always been supported by b43
<earnestly>	it seems like that version (4313) works with brcmsmac
<newphy>	having some troubles at the moment with my arch install. when i pacstrap i'm getting an error about invalid arguments and saying it can't open "...(pacman pkg director)/pkg/vi-1:05(version information blah).pkg.tar.xz.part
<newphy>	am i doing anything blatantly wrong? just using pacstrap /mnt base as per usual
<earnestly>	jonimus: it is a crapshoot with broadcom, some are lucky if you have the exact right model
<newphy>	note, it's saying "invalid argument" to be precise.
<earnestly>	newphy: check with file(1) about what that downloaded package is
<proshot>	ok, the brcmsac
<jonimus>	heh well i have a stack of "working" b43 bgn cards from old laptops so i guess dell picked well.
<earnestly>	proshot: https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers/brcm80211#supported_chips
<phrik>	title: en:users:drivers:brcm80211 [linux wireless] (at wireless.wiki.kernel.org)
<newphy>	i checked for it's existence in that directory, butit appears to not be there.
<earnestly>	proshot: "please note: at least bcm4313 is not fully supported" :/
<earnestly>	newphy: which directory?
<newphy>	my /mnt/var/cache/pacman/pkg/ directory that it's sayin git should be in
<earnestly>	newphy: based on limited information, my guess is that it *seems* like a proxy might be messing you up, and you're downloading html files instead of tarballs
<newphy>	i can transcribe and pastebin the whole log if you'd like.
<earnestly>	!sprungepacman
<phrik>	lc_all=c pacman --debug <pacmanoptions> |& tee >(curl -f sprunge=@- sprunge.us)
<earnestly>	if you must
<earnestly>	although this is pacstrap, hm.
<earnestly>	you'll have to pass --debug yourself
<newphy>	oho, that did the trick. seems one of my mirrors is bad.
<earnestly>	that's the other idea
<earnestly>	(although it's quite rare)
<newphy>	correction, all my mirrors are borked. i think i may have made a typo when using armrr heh. at least it's an easy fix.
<freezingcold>	so with 4.0, do i get new leet kernel hacker features?
<rena>	yes, access them by pressing ctrl+alt+de-- sorry my time machine glitched
<plitter>	i thought asp was as fast as the normal mirrors in getting new updates. am i wrong? if yes, then i'm doing asp update, going to the build directory and doing git pull, but the new version doesn't seem to be arriving
<dawnson>	hmm how do i easily apply a patch file to an aur package during building it?
<plitter>	dawnson: change the pkgbuild?
<dawnson>	or can someone quickly create a fork of the mesa-git aur package that includes the patch file from the first comment?
<dawnson>	plitter: i dont understand where to add it and what exactly to add
<earnestly>	dawnson: see pkgbuild(5) for the prepare() function.  also patch(1)
<dawnson>	i have the tgz of the package and a patch file
<dawnson>	ok then you also need to explain how i get the pkgbuild(5) manpage or am i missing something there?
<phaazon>	hey guys
<phaazon>	i’m trying to use my laptop’s wireless card with the latest kernel
<phaazon>	wireless.linux.org says it’s okay now
<phaazon>	i think it’s not :(
<phaazon>	http://lpaste.net/3226176139068178432
<phrik>	title: no title :: lpaste — lambda pastebin (at lpaste.net)
<phaazon>	any idea? :(
<plitter>	dawnson: man 5 pkgbuild
<dawnson>	ah thx
<earnestly>	plitter: except pkgbuild, not pkgbuild
<earnestly>	although lowercase works anyway *shrug*
<dawnson>	hmm the patch files first line is diff --git a/src/..../ b/src/.../
<phaazon>	no one :(
<dawnson>	but there are no a or b folders
<earnestly>	dawnson: don't worry about that
<plitter>	earnestly: your just a stickler for details :)
<dawnson>	hm ok
<earnestly>	plitter: you're*
<earnestly>	wait
<earnestly>	yes
<plitter>	from now on i'll lieve small grammatical errors in all my sentences!!
<thaweatherman>	anyone here using an xps 13?
<earnestly>	dawnson: patch(1) will figure it out, see what the arguments -n and -p1 do.  also -i "$srcdir"/foobar.patch
<dawnson>	the filename of the patch file starts with mesa-dev, would it work vor mesa-git as well or do i need the mesa-dev (or mesa-dev-git if that exists) package?
<thaweatherman>	i need to do a bios update but cant figure out how
<earnestly>	plitter: that's a spelling error though :p
<earnestly>	dawnson: the filename is irrelevant
<dawnson>	ok ill try it with mesa-git
<earnestly>	it's if the patch applies and it compiles, does it matter.  reading at least once will help you a lot
<plitter>	dammit, my plan has been foiled by silly spelling's...
<newphy>	haha, i found my problem, mounted my boot partition to /mnt and my root to /mnt/boot
<newphy>	welp, i'm bad :p
<dawnson>	earnestly: i dont get what -p1 does for patch
<earnestly>	dawnson: see the manual for -p
<thaweatherman>	does putting an exe for a bios upgrade into /boot/efi handle actually doing an upgrade? (when in the boot menu, of course)
<dawnson>	i am i dont understand it
<dawnson>	ah
<dawnson>	so i use -p2 or -p3?
<hid>	hi again
<binero>	anyone know of a linux friendly wifi card manufacturer?
<binero>	need a wlan thingy

<elocho>	hey everybody just wanted to get someone's opinion on how much of a leap it is for a novice debian user to switch to arch. other than the package management what are some of the other major differences?
<elocho>	i'm getting sick of wheezys incompatibility with the programs i want to run and jessie just seems too glitchy for me
<rena>	i switched from ubuntu recently for much the same reason
<luminarys>	a bit more cli intensive
<rena>	there is more diy involved
<codebam>	elocho: if you read the beginner guide you should be fine. main difference is that theres no automated installer
<luminarys>	you'll want to be quite familiar with basic commands
<rena>	yeah, like you have to install x yourself, but it's really not difficult
<rena>	you might find yourself a bit overwhelmed by choices
<codebam>	well... you dont have to install xc\
<luminarys>	if you understand what the installer guide is telling you to do, the install itself shouldn't be too difficult
<codebam>	*x
<elocho>	what all do you mean diy intensive?
<luminarys>	also yes lots of choices you'll need to make
<rena>	well, if you want x :p
<codebam>	elocho: you start with nothing but simple linux tools and a command line
<luminarys>	manual configuration and whatnot elocho
<rena>	i mean it doesn't hold your hand. you boot to a command line and set it up how you like from there.
<elocho>	ah
<rena>	whereas ubuntu and i think debian set up a gui automatically
<codebam>	yea they do. with debian you can choose what gui with a cli installer
<elocho>	so is it still stable enough to run a home server on 24/7 or is it more cutting edge and somewhat glitchy like jessie?
<luminarys>	homeserver shouldn't be an issue typically
<codebam>	elocho: jesse is stable now
<elocho>	meh so they say
<codebam>	s/jesse/jessie
<codebam>	it is, ive used it
<codebam>	as long as you dont upgrade :p
<dacoit>	you doubt debians stability?
<luminarys>	most of deb's packages have been thoroughly vetted
<elocho>	idk maybe i did something but last time i tried jessie in december it wouldn't run gnome classic and ate up too many recourses for my ancient ass 2006 comp
<seizo>	r00t^2: the problem persists, but seems the first time i crash x when moving the mouse, i get this xorg log showing a segfault: http://fpaste.org/217440
<phrik>	title: #217440 • fedora project pastebin (at fpaste.org)
<seizo>	also i removed the xf86 nouveau package, but am still getting nouveau mmio write errors.. how does one make a clean uninstall of nouveau?
<r00t^2>	ooooh interesting
<r00t^2>	seizo: lsmod|grep nouveau
<seizo>	the intel graphics page on arch wiki says for i915 drm, kms is mandatory. could it have something to do with the change in xorg-server 1.17.1?
<scimmia>	seizo, blacklist the module if you want to keep it from loading
<seizo>	scimmia: ah yeah, that would do it :p thanks

<r00t^2>	seizo: first make sure it's totally removed, too- pacman -q|grep nouveau

<sheep>	thurstylark: what graphics card and drivers are you using?
<thurstylark>	sheep: intel graphics card, and its driver (im told there's only one...)
<sheep>	minecraft has 64-bit native binaries
<sheep>	thurstylark: is intel-dri installed?
<sheep>	crap.  *mesa-dri
<parkerr>	packer is freezing for me right after checking aur for updates. is this a known issue? tried searching and haven't found anything. also tried clearing out /tmp/packer* with no luck.

<thurstylark>	i moved from openjdk8 to 7 for troubleshooting, but get the same error regardless.
<thurstylark>	sheep: mmkay. one sec...
<sheep>	which doesn't make sense since minecraft does come with 64-bit and 32-bit binaries
<thurstylark>	sheep: installing...
<thurstylark>	sheep: no luck
<sheep>	thurstylark: if you have mesa-demos installed, try running glxinfo
<thurstylark>	sheep: for some reason, it's saying that my arch is amd64. i thought it was x86_64... i'm not too certian of the difference, really..
<sheep>	amd64 = x86_64
<scimmia>	thurstylark, same thing
<thurstylark>	gotcha
<sheep>	there are very small differences between the amd64 implementation and intel's em64t implementation, but they're easy to work around
<thurstylark>	what should i look for when running glxinfo? there's quite a bit of output...
<sheep>	just pastebin all of the output
<thurstylark>	mmkay.

<sheep>	thurstylark: server glx vendor string: sgi
<sheep>	what
<thurstylark>	what does that mean?
<sheep>	oh wait never mind that's right
<sheep>	that all looks correct.  does glxgears display animated gears?
<thurstylark>	yup
<sheep>	that's strange.  try moving or deleting your ~/minecraft
<sheep>	or try a slightly older version in the launcher
<thurstylark>	sheep: removed ~/.minecraft/ and the launcher, and redownloaded. downloading 1.8.4 now...
<thurstylark>	nope. trying 1.8...
<thurstylark>	huh... that works.
<sheep>	1.8.1 works for me
<sheep>	report a bug to mojang
<kaibutsux>	can anyone recommend a good tool for building packages from aur? doing it manually is fine for a single pkg, but after a couple levels of subdependencies it gets tedious
<noremi>	yaourt
<noremi>	although many dislike it
<coolthingy500>	yaourt is messy to work with.
<thurstylark>	sheep: yup. 1.8.2 throws the error again, but 1.8.1 works fine .
<coolthingy500>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/aur_helpers
<phrik>	title: aur helpers - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<thurstylark>	sheep: i guess that's that...
<coolthingy500>	i have packer. but i'm on the lookout for something else.
<thurstylark>	kaibutsux: i'm using aurget. it's my first one, and it's been working great for me.
<lmnop__>	yaourt is a really unfortunate name
<coolthingy500>	true.
<kaibutsux>	i'll checkout that wiki, thanks. is my manual method correct or am i doing something inefficiently? i copy the link from the aur, wget link; tar xf package; cd package; makepkg package; pacman -u package && repeat for all dependencies
<lmnop__>	not quite as bad as scrotwm or naything
<switchy>	kaibutsux, if you use a helper for the getting pkgbuild part, and use makepkg -si or similar you can speed it up a bit
<noremi>	lmnop__: why is yaourt an unfortunate name?
<c0deweaver>	can arch have a /boot of btrfs?
<noremi>	isn't it just yogurt?
<seizo>	r00t^2: ok i fucked up. i blacklisted nouveau, yet it was still getting loaded, so as per arch wiki on blacklisting, i put 'install nouveau /bin/false' underneath the blacklist
<switchy>	c0deweaver, sure
<lmnop__>	noremi, if you tell me what it means or how it was named (you dont have to) it probably won't seem as bad
<r00t^2>	seizo: hrmmmmm
<seizo>	now half my modules aren't loading and i can't figure out how to fix it :x
<lmnop__>	i dunno it is too much like yogurt
<kaibutsux>	switchy: i'm looking more at speeding up getting the dependencies from aur
<coolthingy500>	yaourt is messy when it comes to using it. and others before me have mentioned that trying to build pkgbuilds can get complicated or something.
<noremi>	lmnop__: iirc it's french for yogurt
<r00t^2>	seizo: have a rescue disc handy? :)
<coolthingy500>	packer is much simpler to use.
<lmnop__>	u are shitting me
<lmnop__>	well that explains it
<switchy>	kaibutsux, something like cower will fetch dependencies as well
<c0deweaver>	switchy: that doesn't sound confident
<seizo>	r00t^2 nah its a brand new install
<coolthingy500>	yaourt stand for yet another user repository tool
<noremi>	lmnop__: "yet another user repository tool; french for 'yogurt'" https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/yaourt heh
<phrik>	title: yaourt - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<switchy>	coolthingy500, https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/btrfs#grub
<phrik>	title: btrfs - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<r00t^2>	noremi: confirming, it is indeed french for yogurt. harder to pronounce for a native english tongue though; too many vowels smooshed together. :)
<lmnop__>	ahh no wonder
<lyonsb>	that's called a dipthong iirc.
<r00t^2>	seizo: oh! have your install cd/usb?
<seizo>	r00t^2: what do you mean? i am able to use other usb devices
<lmnop__>	i dont think that i can pronounce it still
<switchy>	kaibutsux, i haven't seen many things with more than like 3 dependencies which are also in aur
<r00t^2>	seizo: it's a new install, yes? how did you install arch?
<lmnop__>	or at least i dont want to maybe now i will try harder
<seizo>	r00t^2: here is my dmesg now: http://fpaste.org/217445
<phrik>	title: #217445 • fedora project pastebin (at fpaste.org)
<seizo>	r00t^2: installed with usb
<lmnop__>	parley vu france
<lmnop__>	oh la la
<lmnop__>	um
<lmnop__>	cest le barbe
<r00t^2>	seizo: good. boot from that usb again, and you can mount your hard drive and remove the install line from the blacklist conf (or remove the whole blacklist conf file you created)- that'll get it back up and get modules loading at least. let's skip nouveau and move back to i915 directly to see what we can do there
<seizo>	r00t^2: alright one sec
<lmnop__>	nouveano
<kaibutsux>	switchy i am looking at blink-darcs specifically, but cower seems nice
<lmnop__>	more french stuff
<kaibutsux>	it looks like cower only downloads though, doesn't actually makepkg?
<switchy>	kaibutsux, correct
<kaibutsux>	well thats still better than doing it manually, thanks
<abrarsyed>	it is my opionion that packer/apacman is the best aur helper.
<abrarsyed>	+ powerpill
<seizo>	r00t^2: removed the blacklists, but themodules arestill not loading... nouveau is though.  i can still boot into it, i lost wifi and sound that i know of so far
<r00t^2>	which is weird, because in the output you pasted your wifi modules are still loading
<r00t^2>	seizo: oh. i guess some of your modules depend on nouveau. which is.. weird. you removed the entire conf you created? no more install ... in /etc/modprobe.d?
<seizo>	r00t^2: thats what i figured, which is why i tried that install to /bin/false trick. i just removed /etc/modprobe.d/nouveau_blacklist
<seizo>	i guess i'll try and reinstall nouveau
<r00t^2>	sure
<r00t^2>	if the install line isn't there thogh, that shouldn't be causing other modules to go missing
<r00t^2>	and your wifi module should definitely not depend on nouveau
<seizo>	r00t^2: didnt work x.x is there a way to see what modules are not loading?
<tekken>	nom nom
<r00t^2>	seizo: *not* loading? as in failed? uhm... maybe. systemctl status systemd-modules-load might do it
<seizo>	r00t^2: ah! for some reason my wifi is now off by default, and i have to turn it on with hardware switch on startup
<seizo>	alright! back to square one :p
<r00t^2>	lol
<r00t^2>	i *knew* i saw it in demsg
<r00t^2>	that's gonna be in either your uefi settings or it's something with rfkill. some connection managers can do that for you
<seizo>	r00t^2: eh i'm not really worried about it. this moving mouse crashing x is a real problem though
<r00t^2>	seizo: yeah, 'xactly. it's whenever you move it at all, right? what does journalctl -f spit out when it happens?
<seizo>	r00t^2: yes the first time i touch the mouse after plugging in the usb dongle, x crashes, with a segfault in dmesg.  one sec on the journalctl
<seizo>	r00t^2: doesn't look like there is anything different from dmesg http://fpaste.org/217448
<phrik>	title: #217448 • fedora project pastebin (at fpaste.org)
<r00t^2>	hrmm. does dmesg still give any mention of i915?
<seizo>	yeah when i crash it, i get those same two lines involving drm i915
<tekken>	they need to let me install arch on these desktops at work... just had a kernel panic... go debian
<switchy>	debian does not a kernel make
<tekken>	building php for a customer yay
<billybigrigger>	whats the proper way of running uname -r inside a pkgbuild?
<billybigrigger>	${uname -r} doesn't work for me
<scimmia>	billybigrigger, why not?
<scimmia>	oh, because of the braces?
<r00t^2>	seizo: what do you have in the kernel command line for your bootloader?
<billybigrigger>	bad substitution
<supergeek800>	well, i have a basic functioning system again.
<scimmia>	billybigrigger, braces are for variables, not commands
<supergeek800>	unfortunately the hardware won't boot 4.0, so stuck on lts as a result, but still.
<billybigrigger>	so --with-linux=/usr/lib/modules/${uname -r}/build
<tekken>	no braces
<billybigrigger>	oh, well i just want the current kernel as a variable
<tekken>	parenthesis
<billybigrigger>	ok
<billybigrigger>	thanks
<dacoit>	$()
<supergeek800>	and since i reinstalled, just to get shit outta the way, used a little pacstrap hack that i found in the forms to get linux-lts to install instead of linux.
<supergeek800>	*forums
<seizo>	r00t^2: no idea how to check >< i have never had to mess with the kernel too much
<r00t^2>	seizo: no worries. :) what bootloader are you using? grub(2)/grub-legacy, elilo, etc.?
<scimmia>	seizo, cat /proc/cmdline
<seizo>	r00t^2: ah. i'm using gummiboot (first time) cat /proc/cmdline=initrd=\initramfs-linux.img root=dev/sda3 rw
<billybigrigger>	tekken: thanks, it builds fine now :d
<billybigrigger>	scimmia: thanks aswell
<supergeek800>	however there is one problem that doesn't prevent the system from booting, but messes with usb flash drives, and that's the descriptor read error.
<billybigrigger>	#arch must be trying to improve its bad boy image :p
<sheep>	seizo: root=/dev/sda3, or just root=dev/sda3?
<r00t^2>	hrm. can you pastebin your /etc/mkinitcpio.conf?
<seizo>	sheep: sorry its /dev/sda3
<sheep>	is that the correct device?
<seizo>	r00t^2: http://fpaste.org/217456
<phrik>	title: #217456 • fedora project pastebin (at fpaste.org)
<seizo>	sheep: yeah thats correct
<seizo>	lspci
<seizo>	oops
<scimmia>	seizo, system info?
<rena>	enotty
<scimmia>	i haven't really seen most of your troubleshooting
<seizo>	scimmia: i posted most of the relevant log info in fpaste, you might be able to grep my name in your logs and get those. what info do you seek?
<scimmia>	just basic info, processor, vid card, etc
<r00t^2>	scimmia: would love if you could take over helpng him; i need to get back to editing my podcast
<scimmia>	unfortunately, i need to head to bed soon, so i can't stick around too much
<seizo>	scimmia: http://fpaste.org/217457 hopefully thats what your looking for. i'll post the i915 error again one sec
<phrik>	title: #217457 • fedora project pastebin (at fpaste.org)
<scimmia>	ok, first thing i notice is 4th gen core processor and no intel-ucode in your kernel command line
<scimmia>	seizo, ok, first thing i notice is 4th gen core processor and no intel-ucode in your kernel command line
<scimmia>	seizo, fix that before anything
<seizo>	scimmia: alright, installing now
<seizo>	scimmia: ok, looks like that took case of the i915 errors after x crashes. but it is still crashing from the segfault. http://fpaste.org/217458
<phrik>	title: #217458 • fedora project pastebin (at fpaste.org)
<optikalmouse>	i use windows and linux mint and haven't used arch in a long while but y'all have the best channel convos.
<scimmia>	seizo, is xf86-input-libinput installed?
<seizo>	scimmia: yeah its there
<scimmia>	seizo, get rid of it
<seizo>	done
<scimmia>	any change? the bt should change, at least
<seizo>	scimmia: omg.. there it is. looks like its working
<seizo>	i should have been able to get that one. thanks alot scimmia, and r00t^2
<scimmia>	great! guess i should have gotten more involved sooner
<scimmia>	seizo, that ucode update was probably the missing part. that damned tsx bug
<scimmia>	it's caused us so many problems the last couple of weeks
<seizo>	yeah i didnt know anything about the ucode bit
<seizo>	well thanks again scimmia. i'm off to bed.
<optikalmouse>	has anyone used arch on a host like digitalocean?
<sheep>	optikalmouse: do does some weird kernel and initramfs screwery so it's extremely difficult to run arch
<dacoit>	but doable. just a pain in the ass
<optikalmouse>	shitty. i guess i'll replace my crunchbang with arch perhaps
<lmnop__>	what is it called when you have 2 words and they each sound like the other one but there not the same
<dacoit>	homophone
<lmnop__>	it is?
<lmnop__>	ok thanks
<sheep>	there are other hosts that do natively support arch
<lmnop__>	i remember that now thanks
<sheep>	or that at least run whatever kernel and bootloader you actually have inside the vm's storage
<dacoit>	np
<scimmia>	optikalmouse, allan did a blog post on running arch on do recently
<satty>	hey guys , after upgrade to linux 4 graphics synaptics are weird
<satty>	is it linux 4 have bugs
<lebenserfahrung1>	what's up fellas? how are things?
<optikalmouse>	lebenserfahrung1, good, staying up late for the first time in a long time
<optikalmouse>	been up since 8am
<optikalmouse>	lebenserfahrung1, hows arch?
<junka>	today i got another weird msg on -syu (gzip: stdin: not in gzip format) :p
<junka>	what is going on?
<sheep>	what the
<sheep>	was that all the output?
<junka>	well the rest of the output was the stantard, syncing in core,extra,community, showing me the upgradable pkgs, and the question if i want to proceed with the installation
<electricprism>	is playonlinux in the official binaries? if so it has a update to 4.2.7
<electricprism>	which hasn't entered the arch repo yet
<sheep>	electricprism: mark it as outdated on http://packages.archlinux.org
<phrik>	title: arch linux - package search (at packages.archlinux.org)
<sheep>	huh.  it was flagged two weeks ago
<junka>	happy may day :d
<electricprism>	sheep: i wasn't aware that that functionality was build into packages also, thanks
<chrysalis>	electricprism, its not hard to build it yourself if you cant wait
<chrysalis>	electricprism, arch provides you with everything you need, just change the pkgver and md5sum
<chrysalis>	electricprism, actually, just change source link and leave pkgver so you can get the update form the arch repos when its there
<tekken>	hot pocket
<tekken>	soothes the soul
<tekken>	finally home
<tekken>	so happy
<coolthingy500>	glad to hear it.
<supergeek800>	well, a little depressing running an older kernel, but since 4.0 won't boot on my hardware.
<utack>	does someone know if the cinnamon popups (like here https://i.stack.imgur.com/k2iay.jpg) can be made "invisible for the cursor", like in ubuntu, so you can just click and it is registered in the window below
<shadowkatstudios>	j///dska\
<shadowkatstudios>	oops
<shadowkatstudios>	damnit, never mind that
<aelius>	what's the ` key called in keysymdef.h ?
<sheep>	grave maybe
<sanga>	super key not opening activities view in gnome 3.16
<lebenserfahrung>	optikalmouse: it has been awesome for the last 4 years
<aelius>	sheep: yep, thanks
<aelius>	now i just need to get dwm's statusbar and dmenu to be excluded from compton focus, but the window id changes and there doesnt seem to be another way to exclude them...
<tekken>	hey
<tekken>	i didn't realize that age of ultron wasn't out on dvd yet.
<tekken>	they showed it at work.
<tekken>	:x
<zeltak>	hi all. i have serious issues with my new arch intsall on my x1 (3rd geb)
<zeltak>	*gen
<sheep>	chromebook?
<zeltak>	for once i cant get x to start after i upgraded to latest linux 4.0. i tried i3,kde, gnome and its all the same..it freezes immidiatly after x comes up
<zeltak>	sheep: lenovo x1 carbon
<siavoshkc>	hello
<siavoshkc>	do we have a cli web bowser?
<sheep>	siavoshkc: if you mean a console-based one, try links, w3m, or lynx
<siavoshkc>	let me take tour on them
<zeltak>	here is what i get when i log into gnome https://paste.xinu.at/n7alys/
<zeltak>	it just freezes
<zeltak>	same with kde, i3 etc..im pretty desperate
<zeltak>	any clues anyone? anyone using latest x1 3rd gen laptop with arch?
<sheep>	does the mouse move?
<siavoshkc>	]i mean a web browser that doesn't need a desktop manager like kde
<zeltak>	sheep: no
<zeltak>	and i cant even get to the console with c-a_f1
<zeltak>	its just completly frozzen
<sheep>	maybe there's a kernel panic happening
<tekken>	a log of some sort would be handy
<zeltak>	also previous to the new kernel it did work with 3.19.2 yet with the dock i got these freezes when attaching it to the doc etc
<zeltak>	tekken: sure which log should i pastebin? im pretty new
<tekken>	journalctl -b -1 > lastboot
<zeltak>	when i downgrade to kernel 3.19.2 it will work (im using the laptop now)
<zeltak>	tekken: ok one sec
<tekken>	actually zeltak: did you have the new kernel in last boot?
<zeltak>	yes i did start with 4.0 then downgraded and started x (without a reboot)
<tekken>	okay.... then journalctl -b -2
<tekken>	it froze the boot before last right
<zeltak>	kk
<tekken>	:o
<zeltak>	tekken: will it does boot and i can login on console
<tekken>	zeltak: i'm just looking for the last boot when it actually froze up
<tekken>	however many boots ago that way
<zeltak>	the problem is that it freezes when i start a de/wm like gnome/i3 etc
<tekken>	was
<tekken>	that's the number you need to put
<zeltak>	tekken: thx. just to be clear again since i may have not explained correctly (im still a neewb :)). it does boot and i can login on console
<zeltak>	its the starting x that freezes ir
<tekken>	zeltak: journalctl -b gives the full boot log from startup to shutdown
<tekken>	for that session
<zeltak>	ok i think i will install linux 4.0 , reboot, try to login and then generate the logs and paste it
<zeltak>	give me a minute or two :)
<tekken>	mkay
<zeltak>	tekken: thx really appriciate it!
<tekken>	oh boy.
<tekken>	something is wrong with my vps
<tekken>	it's ooming
<zeltak>	tekken: this is the boot with linux 4 that frooze : https://paste.xinu.at/ljto/
<phrik>	title: boot2 (at paste.xinu.at)
<zeltak>	and this is the one after the freeze : https://paste.xinu.at/zp6pxn/
<phrik>	title: boot1 (at paste.xinu.at)
<zeltak>	i hope thats what you had in mind
<zeltak>	since it complelty frooze i had to manually poweroff
<tekken>	oh zeltak, that's not a big deal.
<zeltak>	ok. so the boot2 file was issued with the -b -2 and the boot1 file with b -1
<zeltak>	again complete feeze with 2.0 and works with 3.19.2
<zeltak>	problem is 4.0 including tons of fixes to the x1 carbon broadwell related bugs :)
<tekken>	looking
<zeltak>	tekken: thx!
<tekken>	zeltak: you use gnome don't you?
<zerkalerka>	whats the file i need to edit again to uncomment multilib for 64bit systems
<zeltak>	tekken: yes
<zeltak>	but same happens with i3 and kde
<zeltak>	etc
<tekken>	black screen?
<tekken>	or actual panic
<zeltak>	tekken: well in i3 i get the gui but completly forzzen
<sheep>	zerkalerka: the same file you edit for any other pacman config option: /etc/pacman.conf
<tekken>	zeltak: you're not frozen.... you're missing input drivers. :)
<tekken>	error while loading shared libraries: libinput.so.10: cannot open shared object file: no such file or directory
<zeltak>	in gnome i get the huge screen i posted before (https://paste.xinu.at/n7alys/)
<zeltak>	tekken: hehe ok as i said im a neewb :)
<zeltak>	do i need to install them?
<zeltak>	or reinstall xorg?
<tekken>	yea hold on, lol.... lemme double check real quick
<zeltak>	tekken: sure thx again really appriciate it
<zerkalerka>	sheep: ty lol duh
<tekken>	pacman -s xf86-input-libinput
<zeltak>	tekken: thx lets see
<tekken>	also
<tekken>	pacman -s libinput
<zeltak>	tekken: it said with both "up to date --reinstalling"
<zeltak>	shoud i try again to install linux 4.0 ?
<tekken>	whereis libinput.so.10
<zeltak>	tekken: let me search
<tekken>	no
<tekken>	its a command
<tekken>	i think
<tekken>	lol
<zeltak>	kk :)
<zeltak>	libinput.so: /usr/lib/libinput.so /usr/lib/libinput.so.10
<tekken>	perfect.
<zeltak>	ok. so try again?
<tekken>	you have evdev?
<zeltak>	mmm lets see
<tekken>	pacman -s xf86-input-evdev
<zeltak>	kk installing                                                                                              master⚡ evdev: /usr/share/man/man4/evdev.4.gz
<tekken>	pacman -qi xf86-input-evdev
<tekken>	:p
<tekken>	also.... a quicker way to check for packages you have in the future
<tekken>	pacman -qs
<tekken>	to search for local
<zeltak>	yeah its there and it again is reinstalling
<zeltak>	:)
<tekken>	after you do that try restarting and not using gnome.
<tekken>	cuz gnome is the devil
<zeltak>	tekken: lol
<tekken>	also
<tekken>	it gets in the way of debugging.
<tekken>	:)
<zeltak>	ok so to test now: install linux 4.0, reboot, startx i3 from console, and it it freezes reboot again and issue journalctl -b 2?
<tekken>	-b -1
<tekken>	but yea you got the right idea.
<zeltak>	ok to get the last reboot after the crash got it
<zeltak>	ok lete me try one sec
<inad922>	ho
<inad922>	hi
<inad922>	does anyone know how cpupower's service works?
<inad922>	i mean i just don't understand from the bash script how is it parsing the params
<inad922>	i want to set the max frequency to x
<tekken>	i always assume cpupower is some kind of voodoo.
<tekken>	man my vps is just being crap today.
<zeltak__>	tekken: latest boot same freeze with i3: https://paste.xinu.at/wynue
<r00t^2>	any ideas why tmpfiles isn't creating /run/log/journal?
<zeltak__>	tekken: hmmm looking at the logs i dont see any entries for today, seems like it ends with 20.3? i issued journalctrl -b1 > boot.v2 . was that the correct command?
<tekken>	zeltak__: looks fine.
<tekken>	do you get a screen with i3?
<tekken>	just no input?
<zeltak__>	tekken: mm no but its just the i3 interface (bar) and the mouse pointer and everything is forzen
<zeltak__>	cant even get back to console
<tekken>	you use a login manager?
<junka>	are files in /etc/systemd/* writeable and readable to all?
<zeltak__>	tekken: no i use startx from console
<zeltak__>	tekken: silly neewb q. how do you see todays date. when i look at the log i see this mar 20 00:30:54 zx1voics systemd-journal[147]: journal stopped
<zeltak__>	it says mar 20 on the right
<demize>	junka: readable yes, writable would be incredibly silly.
<tekken>	zeltak__: good point

<tekken>	zeltak__: i've no idea then.... it shouldn't be spitting out logs that old.
<tekken>	you are using -1 right?
<zeltak__>	tekken: yeah
<aeolus0>	hey guys, i had a quick question about pacman

<zeltak__>	now it did print may 1
<zeltak__>	wth
<aeolus0>	how do i find out what commands that package installs?
<zeltak__>	ok let me paste
<tekken>	-.-
<tekken>	you forgot the tac didn't you?
<tekken>	lol
<demize>	junka: that is not writable by everyone.

<aeolus0>	any ideas?
<junka>	demize; but when i clicked with my filemanager and went to permissions tab it says write and read to owner,group,others
<junka>	aeolus0; rephrase
<tekken>	zeltak__: looks like an incomplete log.
<aeolus0>	junka: i install a package based on its name with yaourt -s, and i want to run the binary ir supplies
<zeltak__>	tekken: ok install 4.0 and reboot then issue logs again
<tekken>	zeltak__: na
<aeolus0>	junka: how do i find out the command to do so, or what the package puts in /bin
<tekken>	journalctl -b -3
<tekken>	gimme that.
<zeltak__>	tekken: kk one sec
<junka>	aeolus0; usually its the package name, read 'package --help'
<zeltak__>	tekken: https://paste.xinu.at/hsbya/
<phrik>	title: boot3.v3 (at paste.xinu.at)
<aeolus0>	junka: that's what i normally do, but i dont think this one is named after its package
<aeolus0>	junka: i can just look at a  -ql and check the bin folders, but is there a better way
<tekken>	oh....
<tekken>	systemd is being a piece of junk and cutting off your logs in the 4.0 kernel
<tekken>	how nice of systemd
<r00t^2>	tekken: you too
<zeltak__>	:)
<r00t^2>	tekken: i thought i was going fucking nuts
<tekken>	r00t^2: zeltak__ is having the issue as well.
<junka>	aeolus0; i dont know, check the manpages?
<r00t^2>	the weird thing is i'm only getting it on my desktop, not my laptop
<r00t^2>	or firewall box either, but that uses volatile storage, not persistent
<aeolus0>	junka: if i knew the command, i can access the manpage, but that's kinda a chicken and egg situation
<junka>	aeolus0; try googling the package for info? :p
<r00t^2>	tekken: zeltak__: i thinnnkk i have it narrowed down to systemd-tmpfiles not creating /run/log/journal
<aeolus0>	lol
<r00t^2>	aeolus0: pacman -ql is the best way, yes. throw a "| grep /usr/bin" on the end
<aeolus0>	r00t^2: yup, that's what i'm doing now
<r00t^2>	tekken: zeltak__: can y'all check for me to see if you have a /run/log/journal ?
<aeolus0>	r00t^2: turns out anaconda installs itself to /opt/anaconda and wants you to add it to the path
<tekken>	r00t^2: i've not got my system up quite yet or i would.
<zeltak__>	tekken: i dont have that file
<r00t^2>	tekken: oooh, gotcha. and /run is created dynamically.. let me know
<zeltak__>	under /run/log/
<tekken>	r00t^2: there's your answer
<r00t^2>	zeltak__: thanks
<r00t^2>	i'ma file a bug report. i'm not sure if this is kernel, systemd, or arch
<tekken>	r00t^2: you tried swapping to rsyslog instead of syslog-ng?
<r00t^2>	but i'ma file with arch anyways. heh
<r00t^2>	tekken: not using any syslog
<zeltak__>	tekken: do i need to create it now?
<tekken>	zeltak__: no, its systemd's job.
<zeltak__>	ok
<tekken>	and its failing horribly...
<tekken>	again
<tekken>	-.-
<zeltak__>	:)
<tekken>	i liked init better.
<r00t^2>	indeed. :) and i think that's why it's failing to append to logs
<tekken>	it always worked.
<r00t^2>	because during the boot process, it does an initial flush from /run/log/journal to /var/log/journal/blahblah
<r00t^2>	(assuming you're using persistence)
<r00t^2>	tekken: zeltak__: stand by for bug report so you can cc
<zeltak__>	r00t^2: thx. im a neewb , where should i look for this?
<r00t^2>	zeltak__: nowhere, i'll link ya :)
<tekken>	zeltak__: he'll give you details in a bit.
<tekken>	its important that this get fixed.
<zeltak__>	tekken: anything else i can try to debug this..should i reinstall arch? could this be faulty hardware?
<tekken>	otherwise kernel errors are impossible
<junka>	what alternative to gksu are there
<tekken>	zeltak__: no.... its a faulty something.... but if it were hardware you wouldn't be in here right now.
<tekken>	:x
<tekken>	stay on the old kernel for now.
<zeltak__>	tekken: thx :)
<tekken>	without logging its next to impossible to determine what's broke.
<xt1ger>	what terminal emulators do you guys use?
<tekken>	i'd shoot myself in the face if we lost logs at work.
<tekken>	urxvt
<tekken>	i always use urxvt.
<r00t^2>	tekken: tell me about it. lol. debugging this shit and getting as far as i did was *not* fun.
<beest>	anything but urxvt
<junka>	tekken; pls
<zeltak__>	tekken: yeah i have a shitload of issues with x1 with old kernel as well :) random wifi/lan disconnects..using the dock coming out of sleep freezes laptop, connecting an additional monitor can freeze it etc..
<tekken>	what's wrong with urxvt?
<zeltak__>	last time i buy a new laptop when it just come out :)
<tekken>	zeltak__: yea.... you gotta give time for the kernel to play catch up on some of this ridiculously new stuff.
<tekken>	especially if the internal hardware is super new too.
<tekken>	junka: what say you?
<tekken>	talking about my baby
<zeltak__>	tekken: ok thx so for now wait for (new?) kernel update, and live with all other crap?
<tekken>	zeltak__: unless you enjoy using tty's all day.
<tekken>	:)
<junka>	tekken; lel, no.
<tekken>	holy nuts
<tekken>	someone on my node is being naughty
<tekken>	i hate vpss
<junka>	tekken; spank him
<tekken>	i miss my dedicated servers.
<tekken>	:|
<shanemikel>	junka: des like gnome use polkit to auth with their own custom apps (to give freedom over the interface design)
<zeltak__>	tekken: thx for your help really appriciate it
<tekken>	zeltak__: i tried.... but systemd is systemd.
<tekken>	and i can't help that the developers are careless retards.
<junka>	shanemikel; that came out of nowhere? :p
<d1etyd3vil>	wait. you play tekken :d
<zeltak__>	:)
<d1etyd3vil>	who do you main?

<beest>	youngwolf: you mean the image icons in the page? that looks like a server-side issue, although i dunno why they're being held by unicode placeholders instead of the default missing image icon
<r00t^2>	zeltak__: you'll automatically get updates from the bug that way. it also would help us out a lot if you can comment saying you can confirm the issue and vote for it.

<r00t^2>	thx!
<youngwolf>	beest: yes, image icons. dont think its a server side issue. it's the same on every website. guess i messed up the config
<r00t^2>	and with that, i need to get to bed. it's frickin' 0441est and i spent far too much time tracing root cause for this
<beest>	that's bizarre, no reason why penta would do that :/

<junka>	shanemikel; excellent, ty :d
<youngwolf>	beest: i know. it was alright but the last couple of days its been like this.
<flherne>	youngwolf: oh hey, i finally worked out what i was doing wrong :p
<beest>	i'd suggest rebuilding penta from hg (or git now, i think) but i haven't touched it in probably the last couple of fx versions
<nkparadox>	youngwolf, may pentadaactyl has an update
<tekken>	so..... the io is so high on my node right now...

<siavoshkc>	is it possible?
<siavoshkc>	for sure the problem is with your acces point
<gar_onn>	got a friend of mine saying "i've never been disconected form this wifi. and i always get disconeted when you are around"
<siavoshkc>	but what does it have to do with arch?
<gar_onn>	dualbooted with arch
<gar_onn>	it doesn't hapen on windows
<shanemikel>	siavoshkc: screenshot ?
<shanemikel>	siavoshkc: or use a program called script which will record all stdin and stdout into a txt file, and then print the file (or do something similar with redirection)
<shanemikel>	oh ... it looks like `script` doesn't sanitize terminal escape sequences, so you'd need to strip them..  actually that's a good question, i wonder if there are any utils to translate terminal escape sequences in plaintext into a common printable markup like pdf
<shanemikel>	or whatever else..  (is pdf a markup?)
<wasamasa>	pdf is not markup
<wasamasa>	pdf is basically a digital printing preview
<wasamasa>	good luck altering it

<brottweiler>	hi. i don't have a ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf, hence i don't either have a keyserver. should i have a keyserver? without one, i cannot add a key i need to add to be able to build an aur package
<sheep>	brottweiler: you probably should, though you could just use the --keyserver flag
<brottweiler>	although, i have a keyserver in pacman.d/gnupg/gpg.conf, but makepkg doesn't see this i think
<brottweiler>	could i just use the same keyserver?
<shanemikel>	ingar: that's beautiful.  also, there is a python-ansi2html in community
<sheep>	yes
<sheep>	makepkg uses your user's keyring, not the pacman keyring
<brottweiler>	actually i fixed it. i added "keyserver http://pgp.mit.edu/" to .gnupg/gpg.conf

<junka>	i installed pdnsd and enabled the service, what else does it need? pdnsd.conf is already configured by default
<sheep>	junka: did you also start it?
<junka>	sheep; yes i did systemctl restart pdnsd
<sheep>	what's its status?
<junka>	active and running
<sheep>	huh.  that's probably sufficient then
<vixxo>	hi guys, is the archlinux ultimate install script still developed ?
<junka>	but i still get my isps dns
<sheep>	junka: /etc/resolv.conf and your network manager's config probably need to be updated to query pdnsd
<beest>	vixxo: no
<vixxo>	beest: is there any similar project ? or is it safe to still use that script ?
<junka>	sheep; i removed netctl, could this be the culpit?
<beest>	i don't know, and script installers are dubious enough to begin with
<jasonwryan>	vixxo: there are plenty of similar scripts: they all suck
<sheep>	junka: maybe but you can most likely configure netctl to use localhost for dns instead of what dhcp wants
<vixxo>	jasonwryan: i remember that aui didn't sucked at all
<jasonwryan>	it sucked
<beest>	it's okay, i remember a lot of things differently from the rest of the free world
<junka>	sheep; pdnsd listens to 127.0.0.1?
<sheep>	if you configure it to
<sheep>	that's probably the default
<vixxo>	jasonwryan: thanks for your opinion, usefull and costructive :)
<jasonwryan>	it's one of my gifts…
<sheep>	vixxo: the official installation process is pretty straightforward if you know what you're looking for
<junka>	sheep; do i need to restart anything when i change the resolv.conf?
<beest>	vixxo: the long and short of it is that trusting a third-party script to install a rolling release distro is reckless at best and unsupported here
<sheep>	junka: most likely no
<vixxo>	beest: of course i understand these issues
<vixxo>	beest: you were good manner explaing me this, but not everyone, that's the reason of my answer to jason
<vixxo>	thank you
<siavoshkc>	it would be easy if i could send a page to printer for test
<beest>	vixxo: i preferred jason's manner
<junka>	shit no internetz

<sheep>	siavoshkc: you can connect to the cups management interface and request a test page

<kiuma>	hello recently, after system upgrade, i'm having many issues. the most annoying is that i'm not able to start gnome anymore. i've checked journalctl and the output is this: http://pastebin.com/vf8cntqc
<phrik>	title: errors - pastebin.com (at pastebin.com)
<kiuma>	i don't know what could it be. please help me
<sheep>	kiuma: how do you start gnome?
<blurider>	is there a particular reason why abs uses rsync instead of git?
<sheep>	blurider: you don't need the full revision history
<kiuma>	both from lightdm and gnome-session in .xinitrc. after xrandr --setprovideroutputsource modesetting nvidia-0 \n xrandr --auto
<kiuma>	sheep, ^
<sheep>	kiuma: when you use .xinitrc, do you use startx or xinit?
<kiuma>	startx
<sheep>	that should work, but it looks like gnome-session-f (?) is segfaulting
<kiuma>	enlightnement is working, (with issues, but it's working)
<junka>	sheep; thanks, i got it working :d
<sheep>	blurider: rsync is much more efficient at synchronizing files than git is.  git's better at synchronizing change histories, branching, and merging
<blurider>	sheep: i see. thanks. there's a fellow on the mailing list whose asking about syncing his kernel config. i just thought it'd be easier with git rebase.
<kiuma>	sheep, it's what i'm thinking, but why ?
<sheep>	blurider: there is a git repo for everything
<sheep>	kiuma: probably a bug
<kiuma>	and i also have problems with acpi. closing laptop lid
<kiuma>	ps doesn't hibernate
<blurider>	kiuma: what's your issue?
<kiuma>	and i've gnome stable

<phrik>	title: errors - pastebin.com (at pastebin.com)

<sheep>	n00balert: which package is it?
<n00balert>	binutils
<blurider>	kiuma: what's your version of gnome-shell?
<sheep>	let me try
<n00balert>	i copied files and modified pkgbuild...(it's installed fine tho)
<n00balert>	i mean via pacman update
<kiuma>	extra/gnome-shell 3.16.1-2
<kiuma>	is it correct to execute `yaourt -ss gnome-shell | grep install` by the way ?
<kiuma>	to detect installed version
<sheep>	uh no
<sheep>	pacman -q gnome-shell
<kiuma>	ah ok
<sheep>	-s will check what's in the repos
<sheep>	n00balert: i was able to compile it fine.  did you try importing the key to your user's keyring?
<n00balert>	sheep: um
<n00balert>	no; i did no such thing
<blurider>	kiuma: your gnome-shell's up to date (not a testing one). your error is kind of generic. the libpthread error could be a lot of things.
<kiuma>	sheep, 3.6.12-2 anyway
<sheep>	n00balert: that's why.
<n00balert>	sheep: how do i do it?
<sheep>	n00balert: gpg --recv-keys 90829082092890289082092
<sheep>	(replace the number with the key id)
<n00balert>	keyid in pkgbuild?
<sheep>	duh
<kiuma>	blurider, so what should i do ?
<n00balert>	lol
<sheep>	if that fails, edit your ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf and add 'keyserver keys.gnupg.net'
<blurider>	kiuma: got to think about this one. to put it in windows' terms, it's like when you open the debugger and it says there's a problem with a driver (it's often not the driver).
<blurider>	kiuma: it says you have  a  coredump. can you paste the output?
<kiuma>	where should it be ?
<blurider>	kiuma: you'd access a coredump with coredumpctl
<kiuma>	blurider, just coredumpctl ?
<blurider>	kiuma: need a bit more info to use that. i'd go to /var/lib/systemd/coredump. see if you see something like gnome-shell there.
<kiuma>	ouch a lot!
<blurider>	kiuma: yeah, that's probably everytime you tried to use gnome-shell, it crashed and systemd generated a coredump. so i'd go with coredumpctl dump gnome-shell > /tmp/gnome-shell.dmp
<blurider>	kiuma: that'll get grab the latest gnome-shell crash and dump it in /tmp/gnome-shell.dmp. then start looking through that.
<junka>	does pdnsd support dnssec?
<sheep>	junka: no
<junka>	waaaat
<sheep>	junka: well, not the version whose manual i read
<junka>	sheep; me so sad now
<blurider>	kiuma: if you can paste that online somewhere, i can help examine it with gdb. you should be able to look at the dump with gdb by the way.
<sheep>	junka: i probably got an ancient manual copy
<blurider>	sheep: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/core_dump
<phrik>	title: core dump - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<demize>	pdnsd is sort of dead too.
<kiuma>	my c knowlege is very rusty
<demize>	dnssec is the reason i went with unbound in the first place.
<sheep>	junka: it doesn't do dnssec validation but it will retrieve and cache dnssec records
<blurider>	kiuma: actually, it's not gnome-shell. judging from your pastebin, it's gnome-session.
<n00balert>	sheep: thanks! i had to import some guy name tristan's key...gpg.conf was fine.
<blurider>	kiuma: yeah, we're just looking for the offending issue here.
<demize>	sheep: which is pointless :p
<junka>	o.o
<sheep>	demize: it's good enough for applications that perform validation
<sheep>	which is pretty much none of them
<demize>	indeed, which is why i use unbound.
<demize>	which does dnssec
<nichego>	can xrandr be used to define a new x screen without restarting xorg?
<blurider>	kiuma: maybe easier is, when did gnome-session work for you?
<kiuma>	irrc before upgrading gnome
<kiuma>	but i'm not sure
<kiuma>	blurider, i've the dump
<kiuma>	whare can i paste it ?
<junka>	demize; the wiki on ubound suggests to cp the trusted keys, i cant do that everytime the arnchors update
<blurider>	kiuma: well, with the dump, you need to run gdb gnome-session <dump>
<kiuma>	whare can i paste it ?
<sheep>	junka: there's a package that contains the anchors
<blurider>	kiuma: uh, anywhere you'd like that can be accessed.
<blurider>	kiuma: so before this gnome upgrade, are we talking about using an older version of gnome-session?
<demize>	junka: uh... they like.. never change..
<junka>	damn
<kiuma>	yea: btw is it correct having extra/gnome-session 3.16.0-1
<kiuma>	?
<junka>	demize; isnt pdnsd faster?
<blurider>	kiuma: no, you're supposed to have 3.16.1-2
<kiuma>	is there a gui for gdb ?
<blurider>	kiuma: for gnome-shell i mean
<junka>	and more awesome feature wise, demize ?
<blurider>	kiuma: your gnome-session's right. sorry about that.
<junka>	the only bummer is the dnssec validation :(
<demize>	junka: what makes you say either of those?
<kiuma>	blurider, gnome-shell is 3.16.1-2 gnome session is 3.16.1-1
<kiuma>	blurider, gnome-shell is 3.16.1-2 gnome session is 3.16.0-1
<blurider>	kiuma: yeah, you have the updated copies.
<junka>	demize; idk, ubound sounds meh :p
<kiuma>	... and now google-chrome crashed
<kiuma>	and i think it's not gnome my problem
<kiuma>	.... maybe
<demize>	okay, then i'll just stop this conversation if you're going to use arguments like that.
<blurider>	kiuma: ... no it still can be. you use nvidia right/
<junka>	demize; does it support edns0? :d
<junka>	demize; does it prevent poisoning? :d
<kiuma>	blurider, yes
<demize>	junka: of course it does, and that question is way too vague.
<blurider>	kiuma: proprietary graphics?
<kiuma>	correct
<blurider>	anyone here using gnome-shell + nvidia proprietary?
<kiuma>	i've yust installed nvidia-dkms few minutes ago
<blurider>	kiuma: why do you need nvidia-dkms?
<blurider>	kiuma: are you running off a custom kernel?
<kiuma>	to rebuild drivers
<kiuma>	no
<kiuma>	ah ok then i get back with nvidia standard (that i had few minutes ago)
<blurider>	kiuma: if you use the official arch pkgs, you don't need nvidia-dkms. they already rebuild the drivrs.
<blurider>	kiuma: wait, what were you running?
<kiuma>	blurider, what are you referring to ?
<kiuma>	kerenl ?
<kiuma>	standard
<blurider>	kiuma: your nvidia packages. where are they from? are they official arch pkgs?
<kiuma>	extra/nvidia 349.16-2 yust reinstalled
<blurider>	kiuma: all right. if you're using official pkgs, you don't need nvidia-dkms. that's only if you're working with a custom kernel or a custom nvidia package. arch automatically supplies the stuff if it's official.
<kiuma>	extra/nvidia 349.16-2 yust reinstalled
<kiuma>	sorry
<blurider>	kiuma: did you activate the dkms service?
<kiuma>	now it's active (but not related to my provblem)
<blurider>	kiuma: i wanted you to disable it. that way nvidia-dkms doesn't build unecessary moduels.
<kiuma>	blurider, just calling `gdb gnome-session /tmp/gnome-session.dmp`
<blurider>	kiuma: dkms (last i checked) violates some packaging stuff. it will leave you with some module folders through kernel upgrades.
<blurider>	kiuma: yeah, but i'd disable the dkms service, and then rerun mkinitcpio -p linux. do a reboot, and see if anything's solved.
<kiuma>	i can removce it now since i don't use it

<blurider>	kiuma: i read your output. it doesn't tell us much. just says it got a segmentation fault.
<blurider>	kiuma: yeah, i'd reboot now.
<thelemonman>	grawity, i have a irc-related question that i couldn't answer by reading the specification, may i ask you ?
<junka>	demize; does it need access to he anchors-keys? or is it configured since it pulls the pkg as dep
<kiuma>	then what ? blurider
<grawity>	eh, sure
<blurider>	kiuma: see if it works. if it's a simple nvidia issue. otherwise, it could be a broader nvidia issue (they had some problems with gnome-shell a while back).
<kiuma>	then i'll disable nvidia and try intell
<kiuma>	blurider, optimus is an evil technology
<blurider>	kiuma: wait, what kind of device do you have there? you have nvidia and intel gpus?
<kiuma>	yes
<blurider>	kiuma: ah, the plot thickens.
<kiuma>	intel is disables
<kiuma>	*d
<blurider>	kiuma: with optimus; i like to use bumblebee. uses intel for everything. manually call graphics intensive stuff with primusrun. however, i heard cuda stuff doesn't work well under bumblebee.
<u42p>	hi, has oss (from aur) been broken for other people as well? anyone know a fix?
<kiuma>	blurider, bumblebee is an inferno with external monitor

<phrik>	title: cat /etc/x11/xorg.conf section "serverlayout" identifier "layout" - pastebin.com (at pastebin.com)
<blurider>	kiuma: i use bumblebee. the intel chip renders to 3 monitors. primusrun always works because it works in a nested x-server.
<kiuma>	blurider, my outputs are separated and i can access external monitor only via nvidia
<blurider>	kiuma: oh. wow, who made your laptop?
<d_garbage>	u42p, did you check its comments?
<kiuma>	blurider, it's msi dominator
<u42p>	d_garbage: yeah, none yet
<blurider>	kiuma: all right, i'd try the intel thing. don't forget the xf86-video-intel drivers if you're using xorg.
<u42p>	wait, quake live has sound
<u42p>	magick
<blurider>	kiuma: if it works, then it's probably nvidia.
<kiuma>	ok i try again
<kiuma>	give intel another chanche
<kiuma>	blurider, rebooting

<utack>	spotify uses ogg? didn't know that
<kiuma>	blurider, nothing changed
<thelemonman>	grawity, re: sasl chunked auth, i have a doubt about the encoding. my understanding is that if the payload is > 400 char then you send the first 399 and a trailing "+", followed by the rest, encoded the same way. is this right ?
<grawity>	thelemonman: no
<blurider>	kiuma: can you run that stack trace again. this time, type in "bt"
<grawity>	thelemonman: you send chunks of exactly 400
<grawity>	thelemonman: and if the last chunk was also exactly 400, you send one more message containing just "+"
<junka>	does chown -r give only read access?
<grawity>	thelemonman: basically the server decides based on input length, whether it needs to expect more data or not
<grawity>	junka: it gives owner access, which means whatever permission bits are set in the 'owner' section
<blurider>	kiuma: your previous debug output didn't return a stack
<grawity>	junka: (though, being the owner, you can chmod them)
<thelemonman>	grawity, so < 400 means it's done, 400 means there's more and if the payload happens to be exactly 400 bytes long then you just send a +
<kiuma>	ok i have to logout thought
<junka>	grawity; how can i view the permissions that x pkg have to y file
<blurider>	kiuma: sure. or you can just try it on a different tty.
<grawity>	thelemonman: yeah
<blurider>	kiuma: you're running x, right?
<grawity>	thelemonman: + means a zero-length payload
<thelemonman>	grawity, ty :) i doubt someone will ever make use of this though heh
<grawity>	well, some gssapi payloads might get largeish
<grawity>	like ~860 bytes when base64-encoded
<thelemonman>	ouch, i was rigth about to read about that mechanism
<thelemonman>	but imo plain over tls is enough
<arthar360>	hi, i want to disable running of commands which will be passed as parameter in ssh. example: `ssh user@server ls`. here the ls command should not run. no command in the place of ls should run. any suggestions ?
<sudokode>	arthar360: wat
<grawity>	arthar360: the suggestions somewhat depend on 1) why you want to disable this, 2) whether you want to keep sftp possible
<blurider>	kiuma: got that output?

<sudokode>	if he trying to pass that command to something else?
<grawity>	arthar360: step 2, write a wrapper script that prints an error message if -c was given, and runs /bin/bash otherwise

<proshot>	ok, my wifi module does not auto load, i create a file in the directory /etc/modules-load.d/ with the name brcmsmac.conf and in that file i put in the the name of the module, but still its not autoloading at boot. any idea's
<sudokode>	proshot: how'd you install this driver?
<arthar360>	grawity, i have made a script which executes when user logs in. it has limited options in the script which user should use (for example the user can only run `cat myfile`). my objective is that the user should only be able to do cat myfile. now if a user does `ssh user@host cat otherfile`, he can successfully read the otherfile which i dont want him to. thus i want do disable it.
<proshot>	the driver is the brcmsmac i think its in the kernel
<grawity>	proshot: have you tried loading it manually first?
<sudokode>	proshot: modprobe brcmsmac ; lsmod | grep brcm
<grawity>	arthar360: and you're running the script through .profile?
<proshot>	yes it loads manually otherwise i would not be online right now

<grawity>	blurider: well the whole script runs on the remote computer
<benoliver999>	almost as if it gets picked up too late
<blurider>	grawity: yes, if you set the script as the login shell for the remote computer as well, they'll have restricted commands.
<blurider>	grawity: i'm just wondering why one doesn't just fiddle with paths in the login script.
<arthar360>	grawity, means set the script as login shell of user in /etc/passwd ?
<grawity>	arthar360: yes
<grawity>	blurider: ...because that's easy to bypass?
<blurider>	grawity: how would setting the login shell change anything? why wouldn't he be able to run /usr/bin/cat?
<grawity>	blurider: because the login shell would reject that
<sudokode>	grawity: you'd also have to add that script to /etc/shells right?
<grawity>	blurider: remember that the shell is responsible for actually parsing the input commands and fork/exec'ing them
<blurider>	grawity: i see

<grawity>	try root:root, or just reinstall the package
<junka>	grawity; unbound?
<sudokode>	won't pacman -qkk warn about differing perms?
<sudokode>	hm. don't know if it will tell you the original owners though
<proshot>	and sudokode any idea why the module is not loading

<grawity>	sudokode: tar tvf
<sudokode>	if you really don't wanna reinstall :d
<grawity>	junka: then why are you reinstalling unbound and not that package?
<sudokode>	grawity: ooo yes
<junka>	grawity; idk, unbound has the perms on the file, not the other way around
<wafflesatan>	can someone that changes fonts a lot spare a few minutes to pm me and guide me a little ? i'm trying to install gohufonts,already looked at wiki and the forums have no idea what i'm doing wrong.
<grawity>	junka: because you `chown`ed the file to unbound
<grawity>	junka: which, by the way, has nothing to do with which package it belongs to
<grawity>	like, if you do `chown unbound ~/music`, it doesn't automatically become part of the unbound package in pacman; it merely becomes owned by the 'unbound' *user*
<arthar360>	grawity, trying...
<junka>	grawity; ok i see, so a pacman -s will do it? cause i cant remove it cause conflicts
<mssm>	if i open a directory with “xdg-open /path/to/dir”, it correctly opens it with dolphin.desktop; inside firefox on the other, “open containing folder” does not care about my mimeapps.list, and simply opens the folder with gwenview. how to fix?
<grawity>	junka: yeah
<junka>	grawity; thanks
<bshah>	whats the pacman option to see full details about package upgrade? (command line switch)
<d_garbage>	don't think there is one
<grawity>	what kind of details?
<bshah>	old version to new version
<grawity>	there is no option for that; see verbosepkglists in pacman.conf
<bshah>	i mean equivalant to enabling verbosepkglist in pacman.conf
<d_garbage>	man pacman.conf
<grawity>	like, really, there is no command-line option for that
<bshah>	okay
<mssm>	alright, firefox seems to use /usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache; why?! that makes no sense.
<grawity>	hrmm, strace shows http://sprunge.us/dfpi
<grawity>	but yeah, it does pick the wrong program
<p0np0n>	hello
<arthar360>	grawity, it is saying incorrect login when i set shell to /home/user/script.sh. the permission of script.sh are 755, root:root (it was user:user first even that didnt work). well as root if i do `su - user` , it works properly. but direct log in is giving error
<mssm>	furthermore, update-desktop-database puts gwenview.desktop into first position for inode/desktop
<grawity>	arthar360: try /etc/shells
<mssm>	any way i can affect the order of /usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache ? wiki says i shouldn't edit this by hand; but it makes no sense to have a bloody photo managing app in first place.
<chmd>	is there a way to trigger a script with udiskie when a device is mounted?
<grawity>	mssm: are you sure it uses only that file
<p0np0n>	i tried to install an arch linux as guestos with vbox. i partionned like that sda1-> / sda5 -> /usr sda6 -> /tmp like a traditionnal mbr partition sheme. but when i boot for the first time i got an error error: root device mounted successfully, but /sbin/init does not exist

<p0np0n>	i say on the net that there's problem with separate /usr partition but i can't find a good explanation to how to fix it
<black_prince>	p0np0n: that's because init is in /usr/bin, and /sbin is symlink to /usr/bin
<black_prince>	in other words, separate /usr ain't supported unless mounted from initramfs
<black_prince>	which you don't seem to do
<grawity>	p0np0n: make your initramfs mount /usr by enabling the 'usr' hook in mkinitcpio
<p0np0n>	okay fine thanks
<arthar360>	grawity, i wish i could give you cookies right now :) thank you :) :)
<mssm>	grawity: yeah, ok; should have read that report more carefully; going to see how i can set my default “gnome apps” without having gnome installed.
<mssm>	bad programming.
<p0np0n>	have a nice day
<grawity>	well, gnome uses the same xdg-mime stuff
<junka>	is powerdns overkill?
<wget>	apsu: hi. is your dell xps 13 trackpad still working with the kernel 4.0.1? i upgraded yesterday and my cypress trackpad isn't working any more. :-/
<arthar360>	grawity, 1 more question. my script starts successfully on login now. but i am unable to perform anything in it. example: it has a poweroff option which runs `sudo poweroff`. it is not working. what might be the reason? it used to work when the script used to execute from .profile
<grawity>	well, what do you mean by "it is not working"?
<arthar360>	i have used dialog box which has poweroff option in it. when i used to hit enter on poweroff, the machine used to shut down. now it isnt. it is not proceeding ahead.
<grawity>	but at which point does it break?
<grawity>	does it execute 'sudo'?
<grawity>	does sudo execute 'poweroff'?
<grawity>	does poweroff connect to systemd?
<grawity>	and so on
<arthar360>	the script is like this: it asks me "what to do?" it has a "poweroff" option. when i used to hit poweroff, the script used to sudo poweroff the system. now when i hit poweroff, it does nothing and again comes to the point where it asks me again "what to do"?
<grawity>	okay, so, my answer is still the same
<grawity>	go through it step by step until you find the part where it breaks
<grawity>	perhaps it's trying to call `$shell -c "sudo poweroff"` and it ends up calling the menu-script
<arthar360>	grawity, it worked.... i just rebooted the system :-|
<tylerdurden01>	i've been having some random graphical glitches with my intel + nvidia (that's turned off through bbswitch) setup on my laptop. i have only xf86-video-intel installed as a driver and yet i get these nouveau related errors messages. http://sprunge.us/jbca

<d_garbage>	definitely
<d_garbage>	you want people to take a look, you don't want to put them off with images of text

<freaj>	hi everybody, i just installed arch as i usually do, this time on a macbook pro 2012 but i'm having an issue, i'm making the lvm over luks like on my usual computer but i run into a problem on boot : "starting version 219" and then "device /dev/mapper/... not found", "unable to find root device "/dev/mapper/..." and it didn't prompt for cryptsetup password.
<freaj>	ideas?
<freaj>	cryptdevice is set in grub, also hooks lvm2 and encrypt in mkinitcpio
<namarrgon>	you rebuilt the initramfs images after adding the hooks?
<freaj>	yep
<freaj>	i'm doing it again just to be sure (i'm currently booting it in liveusb)
<namarrgon>	post grub.cfg and mkinitcpio.conf
<day>	i mounted a network share via cifs. and im having trouble writing to it.
<proshot>	ok, every telegram version form aur gives me a segmentation fault, like the comment overhere https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/telegram-dev/ any pointers for that
<phrik>	title: aur (en) - telegram-dev (at aur.archlinux.org)
<day>	i can write without any issues into the top directory. but i cannot write into subfolders
<day>	even as root
<day>	permissions look ok to me
<day>	that folder works: rwxrwxrwx 22 day day 0 may  1 15:19 wdcwd15-ears-00z5b1-01
<day>	this subfolder doesnt: drwxrwxrwx   3 day day          0 may  1 02:34 other-backup
<ploppz>	what do i do when an aur package won't work? https://bpaste.net/show/49c360d88e29
<phrik>	title: show at bpaste (at bpaste.net)
<ploppz>	looks like it won't comp+ile
<grawity>	day: the access checks are done server-side, based on the username/password you gave to cifs
<freaj>	namarrgon: how can i paste from command line?
<namarrgon>	!give freaj sprunge
<phrik>	freaj: pipe or redirect your command or file into `curl -f 'sprunge=<-' sprunge.us`. this will upload to sprunge.us and return a link to the paste.
<grawity>	day: does the server give apropriate permissions to that user?
<freaj>	<3
<day>	grawity: i mount the share with a generic username given by the router and a password.
<day>	if thsoe were wrong i wouldnt be able to write to anything
<grawity>	i wasn't saying they are wrong
<day>	besides i can create folders, and further folders within the newly created folder
<namarrgon>	ploppz: looks like upstream broke it
<grawity>	if they were wrong, you wouldn't be able to mount it at all
<freaj>	namarrgon: do i need to "cat file | curl..."?
<day>	grawity: yeah. just trying to explain my reasoning so far in case i made a mistake
<namarrgon>	freaj: curl -f "sprunge=<-" sprunge.us < yourfile
<day>	grawity: i have no issues to edit things via the router web interface btw
<freaj>	namarrgon: http://sprunge.us/zeom grub.cfg
<freaj>	namarrgon: http://sprunge.us/dcgh mkinitcpio.conf
<namarrgon>	freaj: you edited grub.cfg manually?
<freaj>	namarrgon: no, i did the cryptdevice stuff from /etc/default/grub
<freaj>	should i paste that too?
<namarrgon>	freaj: you have root= twice in there and cryptdevice doesn't connect to the device with a =
<freaj>	wait
<freaj>	i forgot the =
<freaj>	in the commandline of grub
<freaj>	it's like "cryptdevice /dev..."
<freaj>	that's why x.x
<namarrgon>	yes, don't forget to fix double-root= as well
<ploppz>	namarrgon: is there anything i can do about that?
<namarrgon>	ploppz: can you write code? if not, use the non-git package
<ploppz>	there seems to be none
<freaj>	namarrgon: how can i fix that?
<ploppz>	well i'm good without the package i guess
<solstice>	hi. i have a question about the boot process. once booted, original root on /run/initramfs is unmounted and /run/initramfs is empty, right ? so why https://github.com/vianney/arch-luks-suspend/blob/master/arch-luks-suspend this script hope to find a ./suspend script file there on line 42 ?
<phrik>	title: arch-luks-suspend/arch-luks-suspend at master · vianney/arch-luks-suspend · github (at github.com)
<namarrgon>	freaj: remove it from the defaults
<namarrgon>	freaj: grub-mkconfig should be smart enough to find it on its own
<freaj>	namarrgon: i've done grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg again but it keeps the uuid part
<namarrgon>	freaj: do you still get two of the root= parameters?
<freaj>	also the computer i'm talking with you on has it too apparently and it doesn't disturb the boot, should i manually edit the grub.cfg?
<freaj>	yes
<namarrgon>	post your defaults
<namarrgon>	freaj: also, your encrypt hook comes after lvm2 in hooks=, is that what you want?
<freaj>	namarrgon: sorry for the delay: http://sprunge.us/dxcg
<freaj>	hm, i should put encrypt before lvm2?
<namarrgon>	why do you have root= in there?
<namarrgon>	which guide are you following?
<freaj>	i don't know, i followed that: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/dm-crypt/encrypting_an_entire_system#configuring_the_boot_loader_2
<phrik>	title: dm-crypt/encrypting an entire system - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<freaj>	so... i should remove the root fromg grub, and put the encrypt before lvm2?
<namarrgon>	yes
<freaj>	namarrgon: okay, i'm rebooting and tell you if it works
<namarrgon>	you rebuilt the initramfs image?
<freaj>	i did grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg and mkinitcpio -p linux-lts
<freaj>	i removed root= from grub and put encrypt before lvm2 on mkinitcpio
<freaj>	okay so "unable to find root device ''."
<freaj>	i'm putting back root=/dev...?
<namarrgon>	no. post the new grub.cfg
<htrejh>	hi
<freaj>	namarrgon: okay i'm booting back to the liveusb >.<'
<htrejh>	i have two drives, one having a windows 8 install in uefi mode, and another drive having linux with grub in mbr mode, how can i boot arch & windows from grub?
<freaj>	namarrgon: http://sprunge.us/joyl
<namarrgon>	freaj: lsblk -f
<freaj>	namarrgon: what for?
<namarrgon>	science?
<namarrgon>	post the output
<freaj>	i mean.. do you need the result?
<freaj>	oh okay sorry
<youngwolf>	is there a key for going back a web page when using pentadactyl other than using :ba
<godginrai>	youngwolf: h
<freaj>	http://sprunge.us/jjoj namarrgon
<namarrgon>	freaj: from outside th chroot
<godginrai>	youngwolf: and l for forward
<freaj>	namarrgon: http://sprunge.us/zzng
<namarrgon>	freaj: were you asked for the passphrase this time?
<freaj>	namarrgon: no
<namarrgon>	freaj: the fallback image does the same?
<freaj>	you mean, without the second root= in grub.cfg?
<freaj>	i'll test and tell you
<namarrgon>	do you get dropped into a shell after that error?
<freaj>	yes
<namarrgon>	can you unlock the container manually?
<freaj>	oooooooh!
<freaj>	wait, i think it works :d
<freaj>	i rebooted normally (using the efi from refind) and it asked for the password
<namarrgon>	"normally"?
<freaj>	i had two entries from linux when i boot, the one from grub, the other one from efi (and then grub)
<freaj>	i don't know how to explain, it's.. mac :x
<namarrgon>	i wouldn't understand anyway :p
<godginrai>	blech
<freaj>	okay so it looks like i need to use qwerty to enter the password.. x.x
<freaj>	(but i put keymap in the hooks!!)
<freaj>	oh, that's why, i need to load keymap before the encrypt ._.
<freaj>	namarrgon: either refind reads grub and does things itself, or it launch grub and then grub does its things
<freaj>	i think that's why it didn't work the first time
<namarrgon>	you also should either use a uuid or at least the /dev/mapper path for cryptdevice=
<freaj>	namarrgon: it works!
<freaj>	namarrgon: i'll do it when i will have time, i need to setup everything ^^'
<freaj>	namarrgon: how many kisses do i owe you? :p
<namarrgon>	how ever many you think would be apropriate. convert them to cookies and send them my way.
<freaj>	cookies ^o^

<nexyon>	tom^: the question is not about the error however ;)
<tom^>	but it is
<untitaker>	nexyon: makepkg tries to eliminate user-specific configuration, so your bashrc probably won't get loaded
<untitaker>	nexyon: so your follow-up question *is* probably about the error then....
<nexyon>	untitaker: okay, hmm
<untitaker>	(and you probably don't want to search for a way to disable that behavior, it's highly useful for having the same kind of behavior everywhere)
<untitaker>	nexyon: what you can do is diff the output of `env` in both setups
<untitaker>	but before all that, you probably should just post the error message
<nexyon>	untitaker: right, it was the cflags environment variable, interesting
<nexyon>	i wonder where it comes from
<horsemaster>	does anyone know of a good list of proxies other than sockslist.org?
<nexyon>	the error if anyone is interested: gtkdialog.c:7:7: error: expected identifier or »(« before »__extension__« char *strdup(const char *s);

<smith2>	i can manually set the output for the tv using xrandr, however the tv will black out in some seconds because of 'inactivity'. audio output won't work either marking it as unplugged
<smith2>	the tv works flawlessly with android setup boxes/windows so it should not be the problem

<georgij>	also without copying /etc/x11/xinit/xinitrc to ~/.xinitrc (no xinitrc in my homedirectory) it startx works and uses '/etc/x11/xinit/xinitrc'. however if i were to copy '/etc/x11/xinit/xinitrc' to my home directory with the path ~/.xinitrc x11 starts black screen and then it closes. lol. the log doesn't give any errors either.

<phrik>	https://gist.github.com/buhman/7162560
<holomorph>	xaocon: ^ should help you get running
<johnfg>	openafs won't build against the 4.0.1 kernel.  are we waiting for an update of openafs-1.6.11 or are we waiting for someone to port openafs?
<beest>	there's already 1.6.11.1
<beest>	that apparently builds on 4.0
<beest>	if aur comments are any indication
<johnfg>	beest: i'll double-check, but thanks.
<`ajven>	hi, got problem with build package libdesktop-agnostic, got error in makepkg - http://pastebin.com/vd1wyutw

<junka>	i use openvpn but it does not use my provider's dns resolver, why
<`ajven>	someone know maybe how to fix it ?
<boodsugar>	hi guys, boot is going to emergency mode after last update. error calling eviocskeycode on device node on journalctl, can anyone help me on this?
<diegoviola>	happy international worker's day, camrades!
<boodsugar>	cant boot my arch... can anyone help me? boot is going to emergency mode after last update. error calling eviocskeycode on device node on journalctl, can anyone help me on this?
<aremis117>	odd problem.  on another machine i have a fresh install on it doesn't seem to know how to do separate hard drives.  i set them up on install with xfs and it labeled them as read only.  i tried fixing it in gparted and i get the same effect.  wat do?
<bushido_>	boodsugar: you need recreate the /etc/fstab and mkinitcpio -p  linux <- first for this
<bushido_>	boodsugar: first remove the linux iamges from grub
<bushido_>	then sudo pacman -s linux
<bushido_>	before that /etc/fstab
<bushido_>	then do mkinicpio -p linux
<bushido_>	then rebbot
<boodsugar>	remove /etc/fstab?
<bushido_>	yeah
<bushido_>	recreate it
<boodsugar>	ok
<pylbrecht>	hi, is there a way to tell dwb to use flash as default? i always have to "click to enable flash" while watching youtube movies (really annoying on playlists..)
<earnestly>	you may want to look into qutebrowser
<earnestly>	(also youtube-dl and skip the flash crap entirely)
<pylbrecht>	earnestly: ok, i'll try that. thanks
<johnfg>	is there a way, when i have some pkgs from aur, viz. openafs and openafs-modules-dkms, to have upgrades checked for?
<johnfg>	or do i have to check manually?
<earnestly>	pylbrecht: with mpv you can 'q' (save position quit) in the middle of a playlist, and provided you supply the same url again, mpv can resume the playlist where you left off, mid-stream.
<johnfg>	the latest, 1.6.11.1-1 built fine against the 4.0.1 kernel.  1.6.11.1 didn't.
<pylbrecht>	earnestly: thanks, that sounds great.
<boodsugar>	bushido_: what changes should i make to fstab?
<aremis117>	odd problem.  on another machine i have a fresh install on it doesn't seem to know how to do separate hard drives.  i set them up on install with xfs and it labeled them as read only.  i tried fixing it in gparted and i get the same effect.  wat do?
<bushido_>	boodsugar: just recreate it
<tomty89>	aremis117: wat
<bushido_>	hm
<aremis117>	tomty89:  the mount as read only.  i can't do anything to them
<aremis117>	might have found an answer though
<aremis117>	i've just never had this problem before :p
<tomty89>	you mean you see ro in findmnt or what
<aremis117>	tomty89:  i mean like i open /dev/sdb in thunar and i can't make a folder.
<tomty89>	aremis117: that's probably because of ownership/permission
<pylbrecht>	ls
<tomty89>	-l
<pylbrecht>	whoops
<johnfg>	so, maybe that source will build for gentoo also.
<johnfg>	archlinux's kernel is 4.0.1.
<beest>	johnfg: 1.6.11.1-1 is the same as 1.6.11.1, the dash is the release number
<johnfg>	beest: apparently not, as 1.6.11.1 failed, and it's a different source, where 1.6.11.1-1 succeeded.
<flank>	hey guys. i just noticed that my daughter's account has a uid of 500... should this not be above 1000 for a user with login privs?
<tomty89>	since when arch package has no release number
<earnestly>	flank: it should be above 1000, yeah
<powrtoch>	hi guys. where do i find the acpi log? i cant seem to figure out why my /etc/acpi/handlers.sh isnt working correctly.
<beest>	historically 500 was the first user account
<flank>	earnestly, hmmm.. i am gonna try and figure out how to change it...
<tomty89>	!acpi
<phrik>	http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/power-management-guide.xml
<flank>	beest, ah... ok makes sense.
<earnestly>	flank: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/developerwiki:uid_/_gid_database
<phrik>	title: developerwiki:uid / gid database - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<holomorph>	i imagine with usermod
<beest>	it may still be 500 on other distros, i'd bet a dollar it is on slack
<powrtoch>	tomty89: no mention of any log files there.
<tomty89>	powrtoch: what's an acpi log
<holomorph>	uid_min    1000     sys_uid_min    500
<flank>	beest, this was an account that i created about a year ago on arch. i used be a slack user... maybe i was drunk when i made it.
<tomty89>	!give powrtoch xyproblem
<phrik>	powrtoch: tell us what you're really trying to do. http://mywiki.wooledge.org/xyproblem
<powrtoch>	tomty89: i was hoping you would tell me. old posts tell me to look for "logger" messages in handler.sh in /var/log/messages
<earnestly>	sys_uid_min? hmm
<holomorph>	lol
<powrtoch>	but no such file exists on my system.
<earnestly>	"system accounts"?
<tomty89>	powrtoch: ah acpid
<earnestly>	holomorph: ah, no aging information
<powrtoch>	tomty89: oh yeah, sorry.
<georgij>	can i startx over ssh, i have a display connected to the server machine. can i startx on the main-display of the server?
<tomty89>	powrtoch: seriously i don't know what that thing do. `journalctl -b -u acpid`?
<earnestly>	holomorph: is what constitutes a "system user"
<holomorph>	earnestly: what is "aging information"?
<georgij>	etc. ssh user@server; > startx /bin/mplayer movie.mkv
<georgij>	but on server side
<tomty89>	powrtoch: maybe you should tinker with systemd instead of using that thing
<`ajven>	hi, got problem with build package libdesktop-agnostic, got error in makepkg - http://pastebin.com/vd1wyutw
<phrik>	title: ../libdesktop-agnostic/config-type-color.vala:81.32-81.69: warning: unhandled er - pastebin.com (at pastebin.com)
<flank>	well... seemed pretty easy. userod -u newuid username. i guess we'll find out when she can't get in to play minecraft and the world comes to an end. thanks for the help earnestly and beest
<earnestly>	holomorph: accounts can expire
<holomorph>	oh
<earnestly>	or rather, system accounts don't
<earnestly>	flank: just make sure all the files updated accordingly
<flank>	earnestly, thanks... gonna check permissions now.
<earnestly>	flank: i made that mistake once, so had fun running `find` updating everything :p
<junka>	in iw whats the difference between phy and dev
<flank>	;)
<junka>	eth and wlan accordingly?
<earnestly>	junka: dev is an interface, phy is a physical nic
<junka>	oh
<mattoufoutu>	hi there
<flank>	hi
<tomty89>	!hi
<phrik>	hi tomty89
<tom^>	hi
<mattoufoutu>	i'm having issues with a wireless card, thought i would have it work with the 4.0.1 update, but no luck, while lspci says the device is handled by the ath10k_pci module, it still doesn't work
<mattoufoutu>	and i get errors in dmesg telling thart the firmware couldn't be loaded
<mattoufoutu>	i stored all the info i gathered here, if someone's willing to give a hand :) : https://gist.github.com/mattoufoutu/40f387b5bfc5dcf48812

<freaj>	hi, it is still me again, everything is set up on my computer, i have almost everything, except the microphone.. the sound works, but not the mic, i tried with alsamixer to see if it's muted, i tried to press "m" but it doesn't change anything, no mic on mumble :(
<freaj>	any idea? :x
<freaj>	my user is in the group "audio"
<tomty89>	nooo
<tomty89>	that's only required by jack
<tomty89>	i mean jack audio connection kit
<freaj>	i'm removing my user from the group so, but how can i fix that issue with the mic?
<freaj>	i have alsa-utils, alsa-firmware, but.. still nothing x.x
<tomty89>	freaj: `pgrep -a pulse`
<arthar360>	grawity, hi..i am back ;-) one more question. the script which i used as login shell, now is in binary. how to execute it now at login? entry in /etc/passwd and /etc/shells is not working. any idea ?
<harha_>	why is arch so slick. ;__; i'm only using it through vmware on a windows machine and mate 3 feels more responsive than host windows.
<freaj>	tomty89: oh, i don't think i have pulse
<freaj>	tomty89: the answer is empty
<earnestly>	harha_: that's linux in generalish
<earnestly>	sort of
<tomty89>	freaj: paste your alsamixer in f4 maybe
<teraflop>	harha_: maybe your windows is bloated and you have e.g thousands of things loaded at startup?
<harha_>	earnestly; haha, i guess. well, ubuntu felt like crap tbh, it lagged and stuff when i tried it.
<earnestly>	harha_: it can be good but they start a lot of stuff to cater to the needs of as many people at once
<tomty89>	windows is always busy at something
<harha_>	teraflop; nope. i have a pretty freshly built machine with ssd. it's responsive as fuck, it's just that mate3 feels even more responsive somehow.
<supergeek800>	ubuntu live media are good rescue media.
<earnestly>	harha_: much of the "arch is fast" misnomer stems from this issue, it's not faster, it just doesn't start anything by default
<teraflop>	harha_: ok
<harha_>	yeah... i know that arch is all about minimalism, that's why i like it. i guess that makes the difference, at least some percentage of it.
<freaj>	tomty89: i installed pulseaudio and pulseaudio-alsa and now it works thx!! <3
<tomty89>	ugh okay
<earnestly>	harha_: it's not minimal or about minimalism
<supergeek800>	harha_: arch can also be all about having a blank canvas, so to speak.
<arthar360>	grawity, solved it thanks :)
<harha_>	supergeek800; well yeah, that's more what i meant. a blank os with no bloat to let the person who uses it customize it to their needs, no unneeded stuff, etc.
<trivia_man>	uh oh, i'm trying to download winusb, but i get this: warning: transient problem: timeout will retry in 3 seconds. 3 retries left.
<supergeek800>	harha_: but then gentoo can be about that too, as well as ubuntu, debian, or fedora having the ability to set them up arch-style as well.
<wcpo>	i just did a "umount -fl /mnt", and now i can't mount anything on the /mnt mountpoint. but it says "mount: /dev/sdc1 mounted on /mnt.
<wcpo>	"
<harha_>	supergeek800; haha, i guess yeah. i'll just assume that arch is about many things simultaneously, i'm still a pretty new user of it but i like it a lot.
<cpunltd>	sudokode... are you around?
<beest>	he's at work, on the railroad
<cpunltd>	haha
<supergeek800>	but yeah, if arch is all about minimalism, then the ability to set other distros up in the same way as arch never existed, i guess.
<damarusama>	is there a framebuffer video player that works in the console term ? like the image / pdf viewer for fbterm?
<thrice>	arch is not about minimalism
<tomty89>	arch is not about minimalism. arch is minimalism
<beest>	damarusama: mpv
<damarusama>	thanks
<beest>	oh, in the console, no
<tomty89>	mplayer
<supergeek800>	can get even a ubuntu install as lean or as bloated as you want, just like with arch, as an example, so past default configurations for most mainstream distros, linux in general can be about minimalism.
<damarusama>	tomty89: yeah i read that mplayer can be compiled with framebuffer option right?
<savinaroja>	is there a wiki resource on touchpads which are not using synaptics?
<cpunltd>	ok, i'm curious, supergeek800, how do you get a lean ubuntu install like arch? i'm a long-term arch user and question this statement...
<tomty89>	damarusama: i think there are some vo that can output in framebuffer, but i don't really know about it
<beest>	i thought mplayer dropped their framebuffer output, mpv still has it last i knew
<tom^>	cpunltd: you uninstall 90% of the preinstall crap?
<tomty89>	beest: oh
<supergeek800>	cpunltd: mini.iso, and set it up to a minimal install.
<thrice>	you can install a minimal ubuntu
<thrice>	or debian, or fedora, or whatever
<tomty89>	savinaroja: wacom? *shrug*
<lord4163>	anyone here running arch on a chromebook?
<beest>	tomty89: not sure anyway, memory's hazy, i usually just try to pretend mplayer doesn't exist
<cpunltd>	there's a stripped down iso of ubuntu out there somewhere?
<cpunltd>	i have never heard of this...
<tomty89>	beest: <_<
<supergeek800>	cpunltd: yes, all distros have minimal isos.
<cpunltd>	???
<damarusama>	like ubuntu?
<tomty89>	base group of arch isn't very minimal though
<tom^>	there comes a point when you realize choice of distro doesnt matter much besides your taste for package manager.
<thrice>	the term minimal is pretty dumb these days
<supergeek800>	arch and gentoo have them by default, debian and ubuntu have mini.iso, manjaro has a minimal iso, as well as fedora, opensuse, etc.
<damarusama>	well it's doesn'nt mean anything. mac is trying to be minimal
<thrice>	if you're worried about megabytes of ram or hd space, you should find a hobby away from the computer
<supergeek800>	thrice: i just prefer to use isos like that because i like the idea of having a blank canvas install to set up however.
<tomty89>	what does iso have to do with minimalism
<thrice>	are you reinstalling that often?
<tomty89>	it's about whether package pulls tons of thing as dep
<escondida>	thrice: having a system installed for more than a month can only lead to bloat.
<escondida>	!blot
<phrik>	becuse the 'a' in bloat is blot
<tomty89>	while they can actually be optdep
<supergeek800>	tomty89: other distros having arch-style isos available, basically.
<damarusama>	do i need to use avahi daemon in order to use cups? or once the setup is done i don't need the autodiscovery from avahi?
<tomty89>	supergeek800: i said it's nothing to do with iso
<thrice>	escondida: i think you're sarcastic, but i'm curious about the braindead logic if you are not
<escondida>	thrice: ironical? moi?
<tomty89>	iso should never been to minimal because they should have useful tools handy
<beest>	nonsense, escondida never irons
<tomty89>	it's package policy, not iso
<tomty89>	s/been to/be too/
<tomty89>	it's even quite acceptable for the isos to be a bit bloated anyway
<tomty89>	as long as it's below 4g if it's not targeted to cd-r
<tomty89>	but all these have nothing to do with the actual package policy
<beest>	slack's next release will be on bd-rom
<muflone>	debian has also a recommended option for less-optional dependencies and those are automatically installed by default but you can avoid the recommended dependencies to have a less bloated install
<thrice>	only because slack ships source, too
<wmunny>	any one knows how to change thunars opacity
<michaeltunnell>	has anyone come in to ask for help about quassel crashing? i found the solution if so
<bushido_>	defindd
<lebenserfahrung1>	anyone has experience running cyanogen on a nexus 6?
<tomty89>	arch android?
<alphahead>	wow arch android
<escondida>	lebenserfahrung1: cm has a channel (-:
<jackdaniel>	archdroid ;)
<tomty89>	arch aosp
<cpunltd>	cyanogenmod is an offshoot of android, but they're working to become their own thing (possibly with help of microsoft, which leaves me a bit on the fence about them)...
<tomty89>	aosparch
<lebenserfahrung1>	escondida: which is?
<cpunltd>	i've set it up on a galaxy s3 and am working on getting it on a dell streak 7...
<jackdaniel>	aosp - archlinux open source project
<escondida>	lebenserfahrung1: let me just visit their web site for you and check the contact page.
<tomty89>	cpunltd: huh with help from microsoft?
<lebenserfahrung1>	escondida: http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/cm_irc_channels. got it! thanks
<escondida>	np
<jackdaniel>	tomty89: microsoft wants to buy cyanogenmod (google tried this as well)
<jackdaniel>	idk status for now unfortunately
<tomty89>	ehh
<beest>	how come no one ever holds my hand
<tomty89>	because you are a beest
<beest>	it's not catching, honest
<tomty89>	what so special about cyanogenmod *shrug*
<beest>	it's rolling
<jackdaniel>	hm, they make aosp *usable* without ndk
<jackdaniel>	ndk isn't opensource, and it's main part of androids magic
<jackdaniel>	(google handles it as proprietary part)
<tomty89>	ndk?
<tomty89>	!g ndk
<jackdaniel>	google maps, google integration, playstore
<phrik>	tomty89: android ndk | android developers: <https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/>
<tomty89>	ie google apps *shrug*
<jackdaniel>	and much more
<jackdaniel>	yes
<braindamage>	unfortunately they shove more and more functionality on the ndk and leave the core withering
<braindamage>	so you're bound to their platform
<teraflop>	cyanogenmod is an company i dont trust companies ill switch to omnirom or similar
<tomty89>	meh i use android because i want google services
<jackdaniel>	thats why cyanogen mod is so attractive - google wants to hinder this opportunity, m$ wants to crate it's own ndk on top of aosp
<tomty89>	otherwise i'll get an iphone
<jackdaniel>	salfish-os :-)
<cpunltd>	tomty89: do a quick google search for cyanogenmod and microsoft... you'll see what i'm talking about.
<jackdaniel>	but it's a bit offtop, isn't it?
<braindamage>	tomty89: false dychotomy
<teraflop>	tomty89: that's what i avoid (google services)
<lebenserfahrung1>	teraflop: with you!
<braindamage>	if one wants an open source phone, then you have pretty limited choice for instance
<tom^>	from what i understand microsoft has even gone to the lengths that you can recompile android apps and run it on windows 10. without changing any code.
<tomty89>	if i avoid google services i'll just get back to pc :)
<teraflop>	tomty89: nah
<tomty89>	yes
<tomty89>	because this is me, not you
<teraflop>	sure
<youngwolf>	?
<teraflop>	i started my assertion with i too :p
<tom^>	assertion failed.

<kaliiiixx>	hello.
<wmunny>	quit
<tomty89>	pathetic
<kaliiiixx>	there is a problem is this script, is not it ? → https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/tor#running_tor_in_a_chroot
<phrik>	title: tor - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<hiptobecubic>	i agree about google services
<cpunltd>	gotta get going... i'll talk to you guys (and gals) later!
<hiptobecubic>	without them, android might as well be windows phone. who cares
<kaliiiixx>	i mean : several errors
<lebenserfahrung1>	if nokia had launched an android lumia phone sooner; they wouldn't have to see their phone manufacturing to microsoft
<lebenserfahrung1>	bet android lumia would have very well competed with the iphone
<hiptobecubic>	i think they were banking on os as a differentiator
<hiptobecubic>	stupidly
<tomty89>	they have to *shrug*
<tomty89>	because they are dying
<hiptobecubic>	honestly all you need is a fast browser and a really great camera. most people don't give enough of a shit about anything else
<tomty89>	dying people do every mad things before they go
<teraflop>	hiptobecubic: take a look in deep if you want, into the google settings app ...
<hiptobecubic>	most people don't play games that an 'average' phone can't handle
<hiptobecubic>	however, almost everyone tries to take a picture of their dinner in a dimly lit restaurant
<beest>	i use my phone to talk to people over long distances
<jackdaniel>	hiptobecubic: that's what chromeos aims to do
<beest>	it's like the future
<lebenserfahrung1>	hiptobecubic: not to forget it has to be a *phone* in the first place.
<tomty89>	beest: try radio
<hiptobecubic>	lebenserfahrung1, that problem was solved forever ago. the shittiest phone today is still an excellent phone.
<beest>	i can't fit ham gear in my pocket, i've tried
<hiptobecubic>	the problem is when you try to do other things on it
<lebenserfahrung1>	hiptobecubic: some of the awesome phones made by samsung suck so much when it comes to being a phone
<lebenserfahrung1>	hiptobecubic: its like poor signals indoors and i am like wtf
<kaliiiixx>	any idea about the script i show ?
<kaliiiixx>	on the wiki.
<hiptobecubic>	if all my phone had was an f1.2 high speed camera, a browser, and a good wifi/cell radio, i'd be pretty happy i think
<hiptobecubic>	instead it has a mediocre camera, decent radio, and is way overpowered to enable things i'll never want to do
<hiptobecubic>	like play gta while streaming to a tv with chromecast
<blackrim>	hiptobecubic, in on this late. mind if i ask what phone you have?
<tomty89>	any phone do dab+
<youngwolf>	is there a way to listen to pandora when visiting countries outside us?
<hiptobecubic>	blackrim, one plus one
<youngwolf>	wait wrong channell!
<tekken>	hey guys!
<tekken>	oh god
<hiptobecubic>	i like most of the phone, it just optimises for the wrong things.
<hiptobecubic>	i want a smaller screen as well
<hiptobecubic>	this thing is huge
<godginrai>	dab+?
<tomty89>	!g dab+
<phrik>	tomty89: digital audio broadcasting - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/digital_audio_broadcasting>
<hiptobecubic>	maybe if i had a watch with a headphone jack
<lbv_user>	hi all, i have an usb fingerprint scanner, but i cannot access it from an unprivileged user... how do i change the permissions for it?
<blackrim>	yeah, i am looking for a new phone for the same reasons (other than screen size). does simple things crapily
<hiptobecubic>	lbv_user, probably using udev rules
<tomty89>	since they all got aac decoder, so one thing less
<godginrai>	so it's like radio?
<tomty89>	digital radio yeah
<tomty89>	non-fm
<lbv_user>	hiptobecubic: subsystem=usb,vendor..., mode=0666?
<tomty89>	maybe it isn't dab in your country
<godginrai>	according to the linked wikipedia article, the us merely has "interest"
<random-nick>	does linux 4 have patching out of the box or is it yet to be implemented?
<random-nick>	live patching*
<tomty89>	godginrai: but i think you got an equivalence?
<jab416171>	random-nick, yes
<beest>	the us uses a pretty awful proprietary digital fm tech
<jab416171>	but i don't know if arch implemented it
<godginrai>	linux 4 is supposed to have live patching?  how did they solve that problem?
<tomty89>	beest: oh
<tekken>	godginrai: it's just been implemented
<beest>	i do wish america would have adopted dab+ instead, "hd radio" is fucking dreadful
<tekken>	and its not complete
<tomty89>	beest: ah yes hd radio
<lbv_user>	anyone knows what is supposed to replace the kdesu?
<godginrai>	tekken: i gathered.  but i'm wondering "how".  i heard previously that there were a lot of blockers to live patching the kernel
<escondida>	jab416171: arch's packages are generally vanilla. you can see any patches that had to be applied in /var/abs/$repo/$package .
<escondida>	random-nick: iirc, the live patching thing is still pretty early in its lifecycle. see kernelnewbies.org for more information on it
<tekken>	godginrai: i'd say there still are.... i doubt its even active in the built kernels by default at this point.
<random-nick>	godginrai: what i heard is that redhat come up with the idea to stop everything, apply the patch and continue
<holomorph>	wut "as defined by ibiquity these channels could be sub-divided into cd-quality (100 kbit/s)"
<john_f>	random-nick: config-have-livepatch is enabled, whatever good it is.
<godginrai>	random-nick: if you stop everything, then how would you apply the patch?
<random-nick>	godginrai: that's why i'm skeptical
<mariachiac>	hello hello. i see an arch wikki on intel ucode. do i need to be concerned with this i ahve a mac mini which has an intel core i5 3210m.
<godginrai>	random-nick: same here
<random-nick>	godginrai: how can a program stop the kernel and still run
<trivia_man>	anybody here use skype and noticed the low quality screen sharing?
<godginrai>	random-nick: yup
<godginrai>	!give trivia_man anyone
<phrik>	trivia_man: nope, just you
<tomty89>	mariachiac: just use it
<godginrai>	mariachiac: the ucode is something you can apply if you want, but it is not necessary.  i never applied it.
<lbv_user>	hiptobecubic: if of any interest, my rule is now : "subsystems=="usb", attrs{idvendor}=="1491", attrs{idproduct}=="0020", mode="0666""
<trivia_man>	my friend has the same thing on mint, i did too, could it be my video drivers?
<mariachiac>	godginrai: is there any advantages?
<tomty89>	trivia_man: unlikely
<hiptobecubic>	lbv_user, did it work?
<hiptobecubic>	udevadm might be of interest
<lbv_user>	hiptobecubic: yes :d
<tucos>	how can i make systemd not log errors for duplicate partlabels?
<godginrai>	mariachiac: it's basically updates for the firmware.  so there should be advantages.
<tomty89>	mariachiac: fix your cpu's bug :p
<mariachiac>	godginrai: ok
<mariachiac>	tomty89: nod nod
<tom^>	as long as there is updates for it.
<tom^>	otherwise it doesnt do much
<tomty89>	tucos: patch it? *shrug*
<tucos>	…
<tomty89>	does it come from the kernel
<tomty89>	tucos: why don't you just change the label, as you probably should
<tucos>	it comes from systemd, the kernel doesn't care. and i should not change the partlabels, because i don't care about the partlabels
<tomty89>	wat
<tomty89>	then don't have them
<tucos>	i didn't explicitly give any, like i said, i don't care. silly tools automatically named them all after their partition type
<kaliiiixx>	afk eat
<tomty89>	tucos: this is so pointless
<tucos>	not so pointless as logging errors for it
<tomty89>	i don't care but i don't want to see the error but i don't bother to change
<tomty89>	!give tucos wipe
<earnestly>	tucos: ask #systemd, you may get better suggestions there
<mattoufoutu>	tomty89, thx, i'm gonna give this a try, not much to lose anyway ^^
<tomty89>	wipe it all and use a non silly tool *shrug*
<tomty89>	mattoufoutu: actually after some further search it seems that the firmware is not released
<earnestly>	tucos: (although it is a bit quiet atm)
<tomty89>	mattoufoutu: and you can't use a hw3.0 firmware for hw2.1 device
<siavoshkc>	what is this number like 20121221-3 at the end of some packages?
<beest>	release version

<earnestly>	tucos: btw, out of curiosity, what does an error look like for duplicate partlabels?
<tucos>	earnestly: http://sprunge.us/pafq
<earnestly>	ah, this
<tucos>	in the end i just have one symlink for the partlabel
<beest>	siavoshkc: package release numbering, repackaging of the same upstream source version
<earnestly>	tucos: i believe this was a mistake lennart made in bumping the log level up when it should have been in debug, it's fixed apparently
<beest>	yup, i get a handful on every boot now, gives me something to look at
<tucos>	earnestly: ah, indeed, found the commit. guess i'll just have to filter them for a while.
<earnestly>	tucos: i was just looking for the commit, but couldn't find it
<tucos>	it's 5259bcf
<earnestly>	ah derp, yes.  i ignored the message for some reason
<nixnerd>	what's up everyone
<nixnerd>	lively bunch today.
<kaliiiixx>	any idea bis?
<ahtapot>	hey what should i do to use linux-lts to boot up with it
<jelle>	select it on boot?
<jelle>	i guess you might have to add it in your bootlaoder
<ahtapot>	so i should update grub then right?
<jelle>	ahtapot: if it's not there yes :p
<kaliiiixx>	please help me :/
<jelle>	do i really need to ask for a question then
<nixnerd>	kaliiiixx: what's you issue?
<jelle>	nixnerd: you!
<kaliiiixx>	nixnerd: i get several errors when running this script. → https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/tor#running_tor_in_a_chroot

<`ajven>	hi, someone playing in diablo 3 maybe and got cursor bug ??
<nixnerd>	kaliiiixx: what errors do you get?

<jelle>	niceee
<tom^>	`ajven: works here
<nixnerd>	kaliiiixx: sorry... i don't understand what's going on here.
<`ajven>	tom^: for me is working also but after few min (random time) my cursor stuck and i have to restart game :(

<kaliiiixx>	nixnerd: no problem :)
<`ajven>	tom^: its problem becouse im playing on hc
<tom^>	`ajven: odd, i can play for hours
<`ajven>	tom^: hmm ok so i have to find someone with this bug maybe will find answer
<tom^>	`ajven: yea im playing seasonal hc too :p
<tom^>	`ajven: however im building wine-staging
<tom^>	`ajven: and run it in virtual desktop mode or w/e
<jelle>	where is my beer
<jelle>	tom^: wine for?
<tom^>	jelle: diablo 3
<jelle>	tom^: lol
<jesin>	how does lldb compare to gdb for debugging c++ code?
<jelle>	try them both?
<pandb>	what does the hyphen do here, in bash: ${variable-} ?
<kalexort>	pandb: nothing? probably a typo
<kalexort>	see `man bash` and jump to parameter expansion section
<earnestly>	!bashpe
<phrik>	http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/pe
<pandb>	so then ${parameter-} would "expand" to an empty string in this case?
<pandb>	if parameter is unset, that is
<demize>	indeed, which is pointless indeed.
<smith2>	maybe someone has a clue on this: i have an external display via hdmi. i have configured it using kernel command line parameters. the screen is turned on during boot, i can see the console text and so on. when the window manager starts (cinnamon), the screen gets dimmed after a few seconds. if i shutdown the computer it will turn on showing the console before the computer shuts down.
<kalexort>	sounds like backlight is dimmed?

<fspkwon91>	hey can anyone help me out who has plasma5, my breeze dark theme doesnt work it shows up as breeze light with no icons
<fspkwon91>	could it be a permissions error?
<`ajven>	hm ?
<rkreis>	/exec -out dmesg
<`ajven>	you think so ? :d
<fspkwon91>	dunno
<fspkwon91>	im retarded when it comes to stuff like this
<fspkwon91>	would anyone mind exporting a working theme and uploading it to 4shared or mediafire or google drive or dropbox or something
<fspkwon91>	im trying to find breeze dark 0.9.7 on the net but nothing....
<fspkwon91>	apparently its a known issue in kubuntu maybe itll get an update and start working, i had the same problem with plastik on kde5, but was that on ubuntu? i dunno.... oh well
<billybigrigger>	i have a package i'm trying to make a pkgbuild for...but one of the scripts it uses to run regression tests wants root
<billybigrigger>	i'm not pkgbuild guru, but what is the best way to run this check.sh script?
<tom^>	why does it need root? o_o
<billybigrigger>	add it to package() because that runs as root no?
<earnestly>	billybigrigger: check()
<earnestly>	billybigrigger: package() runs under fakeroot
<billybigrigger>	ahhh
<seylerius>	earnestly: there's a function just for that?
<earnestly>	seylerius: yes, pkgbuild(5)
<delusionallogic>	where does systemd save the log for suspend?
<sledgehammer>	in the journal, like everything else
<billybigrigger>	earnestly: hmmmm...it fails in check()
<delusionallogic>	does it have a unit name or is it just the kernel channel?
<billybigrigger>	but i didn't even specify check() in the pkgbuild yet...
<billybigrigger>	make: *** [check-recursive] error 1
<billybigrigger>	make: target 'check' not remade because of errors.
<kremlin->	is there any reason to ever use open(3)+friends instead of fopen(3)?
<billybigrigger>	nvm
<earnestly>	kremlin-: open(2)
<kremlin->	:) fine
<kremlin->	open two
<delusionallogic>	ohh, systemd-sleep. i was hoping there was a more detailed log somewhere.
<delusionallogic>	since i cant resume from suspend, but the journal is no help
<kremlin->	they seem to do the same things with int fds instead of file*s
<kremlin->	but gets() man page says 'don't use this' so
<earnestly>	kremlin-: yes, open uses fd's, is a syscall.  fopen uses open, uses files, isn't a syscall.
<kremlin->	oh, didn't know that
<earnestly>	there's also no *at() versions afaik
<earnestly>	the rational for the *at() versions is detailed in open(2), which is nice, yay michael kerrisk
<earnestly>	although fdopen uses fd
<earnestly>	kremlin-: fopen is also buffered
<abrarsyed>	probably not the place to ask.. but anyone know where i can get a decently priced ssd?
<abrarsyed>	er.. thats basdly phrased, anyone know a good non-crappy yet cheap ssd
<earnestly>	kremlin-: anyway, you should use fopen since it's a c standard
<earnestly>	kremlin-: "open" is a os specific thing
<sledgehammer>	abrarsyed, ebay :)
<abrarsyed>	in my experience, ebay has been great for cheap stuff, but most of the time it dies very quickly..
<abrarsyed>	falls into the crappy end of the spectrum
<earnestly>	(although it is posix, that's not usually good enough.  some os might call their open syscall ouvert and your code using open() will fail.  usually fopen() will call the underlying syscall, and it will continue to work.)
<sledgehammer>	as the old saying goes - you get what you pay for
<earnestly>	since that os will simply make fopen use ouvert()
<malthe>	abrarsyed, i recently got a 250 gb samsung 850 evo, it was cheap.
<abrarsyed>	samsung seems to be the goto brand for ssds... i gues il just go for one of those then..
<abrarsyed>	now.. another ssd related question.. hoq big you think one needs to be to house a dualboot with windows, with no other hd
<wildefyr>	their write isn't the best, mine i got never performed to what was advertised
<wildefyr>	read is great though
<abrarsyed>	*how
<wildefyr>	well, i ran tests, numbers i got didn't match up
<abrarsyed>	so far i dont think my arch install has broken 100g but windows seems to require atleast 300 to maintaind ecent preformance..
<wildefyr>	also windows requires minimum of 60gb
<abrarsyed>	wildefyr, the how was a correction to my earlier statement where i typed "hoq" instead, but good to know :)
<agregory>	earnestly: open wraps a syscall, it's still part of libc same as fopen
<wildefyr>	because for some reason windows likes to store all its temp files
<earnestly>	agregory: open is not defined in the standard though
<wildefyr>	and not allow the user to easily offload data to another drive
<earnestly>	it is posix though
<agregory>	earnestly: i know, worrying about underlying syscall names makes no sense
<wildefyr>	you can probably get away with 120gb if you keep everything minimum overall though abrarsyed
<earnestly>	agregory: open is the name of the open syscall on linux, so i don't know what you mean by wrap
<agregory>	compare musl's fopen and open, they both make the same syscall
<earnestly>	agregory: i was saying, that if a platform implements c, fopen will likely use their syscall, whatever it's called or numbered
<agregory>	but so will open
<earnestly>	but open is not part of c
<abrarsyed>	hmm, thanks wildefyr
<earnestly>	open() doesn't need to exist
<agregory>	yes, i know that, but the underlying syscall name doesn't matter, because open is still part of libc
<earnestly>	what /are/ you talking about?
<wildefyr>	abrarsyed: thats also presuming you have a secondary drive for music/video storage
<demize>	glibc at least, not all libcs
<earnestly>	just because a libc includes open()?
<trivia_man>	what do i do, i switched off usb during boot up in my bios, now i can't access it at all d:
<earnestly>	demize: most do, it's a posix requirement
<demize>	sure, but not all oss are posix
<earnestly>	"open is still part of libc", not necessarily ^
<kaliiiixx>	hello !
<earnestly>	open doesn't *have* to be part of a libc
<kaliiiixx>	could someone help me please ?
<earnestly>	kaliiiixx: no one can help you because no one knows what you need help with
<nizumzen>	kaliiiixx: don't ask to ask
<wildefyr>	dont ask to ask...
<kaliiiixx>	well :)
<kaliiiixx>	i follow this → https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/tor#running_tor_in_a_chroot
<phrik>	title: tor - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<kaliiiixx>	and when i enter sudo chroot --userspec=tor:tor /opt/torchroot/ /usr/bin/tor
<kaliiiixx>	i get
<kaliiiixx>	chroot: failed to run command ‘/usr/bin/tor’: no such file or directory
<earnestly>	kaliiiixx: is there a /opt/torchroot/usr/bin/tor?
<kaliiiixx>	[kalix@arch-desktop ~]$ ls /opt/torchroot/usr/bin/
<kaliiiixx>	tor
<earnestly>	kaliiiixx: file it
<kaliiiixx>	and launching it works
<earnestly>	kaliiiixx: file
<kaliiiixx>	/opt/torchroot/usr/bin/tor: elf 32-bit lsb shared object, intel 80386, version 1 (sysv), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux.so.2, for gnu/linux 2.6.32, buildid[sha1]=24b2ce7271bb23ddaeed8e46a761f48993922ee8, stripped
<earnestly>	kaliiiixx: and uname -m?
<kaliiiixx>	i686
<earnestly>	that's weird then
<kaliiiixx>	earnestly: indeed.
<kaliiiixx>	any idea ?
<earnestly>	kaliiiixx: you ran that script, i assume?
<kaliiiixx>	earnestly: of course.
<earnestly>	kaliiiixx: do you have a linker in the destination newroot?
<kaliiiixx>	sorry, i do not understand :/
<earnestly>	kaliiiixx: e.g. /usr/lib/ld-2.21.so
<earnestly>	kaliiiixx: run that shared object, read what it prints, just for some insight
<earnestly>	kaliiiixx: since the script copies from /lib instead of /usr/lib.  /lib is a symlink, it should work, but "file not found" is odd.
<earnestly>	i can't think of anything else
<oarmstrong>	i've got 2 sounds cards, the mobo one and a usb dac and i want to be able to switch between which one the output goes to at will.  is this possible with just alsa?  i don't need extra stuff with pulse (different outputs/volume levels per application), just want all output to go to mobo or usb
<earnestly>	maybe strace will show you something but this is pretty much grasping at straw
<earnestly>	oarmstrong: use pulseaudio
<oarmstrong>	earnestly: would there be a way to "lock" all applications to the same output?  when i've used it previously i've had to change the output device of all applications
<earnestly>	sure, that's the default behaviour
<linnak>	hi, where can i find a working step by step installation manual on one page from the first line till the working os? there are too many and none of them works
<earnestly>	!give linnak wiki installation guide
<phrik>	linnak: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide
<oarmstrong>	not when i just tried it, i changed the default output and music continued to play through speakers, had to change the output of each application manually (was using pavucontrol)
<codebam>	how do i make sure that my media drive mounted with my fstab will have proper permissions so that regular users as well as mediatomb will be able to access it?
<oarmstrong>	ideally i could hit a keyboard shortcut and all audio switches over to the usb
<earnestly>	sure thing, can be done quite trivially
<earnestly>	just learn about it, and the tooling it provides
<oarmstrong>	thanks, at least i know it can be done :)
<kaliiiixx>	should i create tor user ?
<du5tball>	is there an easy way to convert my whole drive to lvm without reformatting it?
<irgendwie>	may seem like a stupid question, but how do you guys handle your bookmarks? i often do some research und therefore have lots of folders with a lot of bookmarks
<irgendwie>	by now, i loose my view ofer them
<seylerius>	irgendwie: like web bookmarks?
<dacoit>	there are a couple in-place lvm conversion tools blocks. i remain wary though
<irgendwie>	yeah, web bookmarks
<dacoit>	*like blocks
<tom^>	i dont even have bookmarks
<seylerius>	irgendwie: firefox and chromium both support tagging, which makes things a lot easier. also, using a tiddlywiki with the tiddlyclip ff extension allows you to clip page-bits straight into a wiki.
<irgendwie>	seylerius: tried the tag feature sometimes, but i'm not totally happy with that - it's still a mess
<seylerius>	sounds like you might need to annotate your stuff more. look into tiddlyclip.
<irgendwie>	i will have a look, thanks!
<irgendwie>	seylerius: do you use tiddlyclip/tiddlywiki yourself?
<namarrgon>	du5tball: no
<seylerius>	irgendwie: i mean to, but i haven't had time to set things up.
<irgendwie>	haha, yeah, i know that problem
<agregory>	earnestly: my point is just that the fact that open is a syscall is irrelevant, its portability is no different than any other posix function
<earnestly>	agregory: i didn't really try to claim that it being a syscall is relevant, just that it's a difference
<earnestly>	(although it is relevant that open (syscall or not) is not part of the c standard which might matter to those who want to write portable c code (or compliant))
<agregory>	then i don't understand the point of "ouvert" if you were just trying to say that some systems might not implement open
<earnestly>	they might implement it, under a different name, nothing stopping them, no standard requires it
<earnestly>	they might implement fopen using this different name.  code using fopen will work, code using open will not.  that's all i wanted to make a point of, basically explicitly saying that open is not c
<earnestly>	(standard c*)
<agregory>	meh, if the libc lacks open it's not really relevant if it provides its functionality under another name, open is still missing
<earnestly>	and that's fine
<earnestly>	libc doesn't have to provide "open"
<codebam>	i deleted my mediatomb config file... how can i get it to generate another one?
<earnestly>	code using open() is basically wrong, unless you know what you're doing.  at least according to jpl standards
<agregory>	well, it doesn't have to provide anything, even standardized c features can be missing
<earnestly>	then it's incomplete too :p
<tomty89>	codebam: in /etc?
<agregory>	sure, but i don't know of any complete libc
<earnestly>	i don't either
<codebam>	tomty89: no /var/lib/mediatomb/.mediatomb/config.xml
<earnestly>	agregory: i don't know any which don't have open either
<earnestly>	does that change anything?  not really, it has practical implication, that's all
<tomty89>	codebam: just restart the program?
<codebam>	tomty89: i did. still nothing there.
<agregory>	openat is way too convenient for me to worry about portability
<earnestly>	sudokode: http://www.newscientist.com/data/images/ns/cms/dn27464/dn27464-1_1200.jpg
<tomty89>	codebam: you may have to reinstall if it comes with the package, but idk *shrug*
<earnestly>	agregory: that's why i said "unless you know what you're doing".  jpl standards require strict adherence to the language specification, but then they program curiosity, so it has to never fail.
<codebam>	tomty89: i reinstalled with -s. should i -rns first and then run -s again?
<earnestly>	codebam: that won't do anything
<tomty89>	codebam: nope
<codebam>	earnestly: so what do i do to get another config file then?
<earnestly>	codebam: most configs are stored in your users home, pacman doesn't touch those locations on arch
<codebam>	this was in /var/lib/mediatomb/.mediatomb/config.xml
<earnestly>	gross :s
<ph0x>	hi
<ph0x>	earnestly: i remember you
<ph0x>	how have you been
<earnestly>	codebam: does the package track it?
<tomty89>	codebam: is there an actual problem btw :p
<earnestly>	codebam: i.e. is that file owned
<codebam>	tomty89: what do you mean?
<codebam>	earnestly: i'm not sure...?
<earnestly>	codebam: pacman -qo that/file
<tomty89>	codebam: i mean is the program not working without it
<codebam>	its non existent. i deleted it by accident
<codebam>	tomty89: yea it doesnt work
<tomty89>	d:
<earnestly>	then installing it again with -s (which does reinstall) should re-extract it
<usr13>	is there a command-line way to turn off power-save, or sleep mode, or what ever is causing my system to quit outputting video?
<ph0x>	probably
<earnestly>	usr13: "quit outputting video"?
<ph0x>	did you look on the wiki
<codebam>	earnestly: i did that. but its still not there. it was from aur though. so it was a -u
<ph0x>	sounds like something covered in the wiki
<earnestly>	codebam: so then -u again
<codebam>	earnestly: i did.
<codebam>	still not there
<tomty89>	!dpms
<earnestly>	agregory: does -u work the same as -s when it comes to reinstalling?
<alad>	!give usr13 wiki dpms
<phrik>	usr13: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/display_power_management_signaling
<codebam>	i did all this before i even asked you guys.
<earnestly>	alad: it's an xy
<usr13>	earnestly: yes, looks like it's just shutting off video signal on the vga port.
<earnestly>	don't jump to dpms straight away
<dacoit>	meh just delete the .mediatomb and restart the service
<earnestly>	usr13: "it"?  what is providing video, what are you doing?  what programs are involved
<earnestly>	?
<codebam>	dacoit: i'll try that. thanks
<usr13>	mythtv
<tomty89>	rm -r /var/lib/mediatomb lol
<earnestly>	okay, and?
<dacoit>	mediatomb/.mediatomb
<usr13>	i need arch to be in appliance mode.
<earnestly>	arch doesn't have "appliance mode"
<agregory>	earnestly: there's no difference between -u and -s other than where the package comes from
<d_garbage>	unless you install it on a toaster :p
<d_garbage>	!sting
<phrik>	ba-dum *ching*
<earnestly>	look, you're just running some software on a machine with a single monitor output, no lid closing involved, and it goes into powersaving mode?
<tomty89>	!emacs
<phrik>	a great operating system lacking only a decent text editor
<earnestly>	agregory: thanks
<earnestly>	agregory: i wasn't sure
<d_garbage>	is that right though?
<earnestly>	usr13: if that's the case, you need to figure out why mythtv is not inhibiting powersave, like pretty much all media players do
<d_garbage>	i do vaguely recall that -s does do something that -u doesn't, can't remember what though
<tomty89>	downloading the package and put it to cache
<tomty89>	if it's not there yet
<d_garbage>	no, other than that
<tomty89>	pacsave maybe
<d_garbage>	tomty89, i found out the other day you can actually do that, if you use file://
<earnestly>	as a hack, you can temporarily do `xset dpms force off` or `setterm -blank 0 -powersave off` on tty.
<earnestly>	but try to fix it properly
<tomty89>	d_garbage: ehh
<d_garbage>	tomty89, it treats it as a download
<tomty89>	earnestly: noooo
<tomty89>	xset -dpms
<earnestly>	or, yeah
<tomty89>	and probably also xset s off
<earnestly>	i'm so used to foribly turning screens off ;/
<earnestly>	good catch
<ph0x>	why wouldyou use arch on an aplliance
<ph0x>	i dont want to update my video player once a day
<earnestly>	you don't have to update arch one a day, or a week or a month or more.
<ph0x>	you dont have to
<earnestly>	and it's fine to not
<ph0x>	but you probably should
<ph0x>	if i go more than 2 weeks when i try to update it just breaks
<yeowang>	ph0x: it's probably fine if you do it every third to seventh day.
<earnestly>	generally there's no real need other than wanting newer software with bug fixes.
<earnestly>	i update machines months apart, it's fine.  if you know what you're doing
<ph0x>	what sthat you used to say
<yeowang>	ph0x: the hell do you have installed? i didn't update for 5 weeks because i moved and didn't have internet. *nothing* broke.
<ph0x>	arch doesnt like being neglected
<ph0x>	or was that patched
<codebam>	okay. so i did that, still the config file isnt there
<ph0x>	make oen
<alad>	ph0x, i'm curious how many local packages you have
<alad>	pacman -qm | wc -l
<earnestly>	most people are better off keeping up to date because they don't follow the news, dev-public or understand small issues.
<tomty89>	codebam: i wonder if it's really about the config
<dacoit>	codebam: you removed /var/lib/mediatomb/.mediatomb right?
<ph0x>	well i reinstalled sicne then obviously
<codebam>	tomty89: what do you mean?
<earnestly>	alad: but my local packages come from a repo, :/
<codebam>	dacoit: yes. and reinstalled
<ph0x>	5
<ph0x>	alad
<tomty89>	codebam: i mean what's the error you see
<dacoit>	codebam: i just did it here out curiosity. .mediatomb gets regenerated when i restart the service as expected
<alad>	earnestly, but you don't have 500 custom packages in your repo
<tomty89>	codebam: is it literally complaining about the config?
<alad>	right?
<ph0x>	no
<earnestly>	alad: i have about 100
<earnestly>	alad: and 66 forign ones, hmm
<codebam>	tomty89: no error. the server just doesnt run properly
<ph0x>	thats the worst
<tomty89>	ugh
<codebam>	dacoit: in your user dir? or in /var
<d_garbage>	i have one package from the eur :)
<d_garbage>	the earnestly user repository. heh
<dacoit>	 /var
<earnestly>	alad: but not 500, and i don't use 100 of them either
<codebam>	dacoit: thats weird... did you remove .mediatomb or mediatomb?
<earnestly>	alad: probably about 30 of them
<earnestly>	d_garbage: eur, secret plot
<alad>	sometimes i see people on bbs boasting those 500+ numbers, and i don't get it
<tomty89>	go gentoo
<earnestly>	alad: well, demonicmaniac3 has a lot
<d_garbage>	earnestly, i have to use the rss feed because cower doesn't cover it :)
<earnestly>	alad: because a ton of software is not official packaged
<earnestly>	d_garbage: hm?
<earnestly>	alad: lots of utility stuff as well like pcalc
<dacoit>	codebam: is yout /etc/conf.d/mediatomb altered from default?
<ph0x>	ill compile something from source because i want a new version
<d_garbage>	earnestly, the rss feed on githib, to see when there are updates
<ph0x>	but with arch thats rare
<ph0x>	with debain its most
<earnestly>	d_garbage: ah, i should push stuff, i haven't for awhile
<codebam>	dacoit: it shouldnt be. i didnt modify it
<d_garbage>	https://github.com/earnestly/pkgbuilds/commits/master.atom
<phrik>	title: recent commits to pkgbuilds:master load of version bumps and tweaks add orbment, renamed from loliwm. re-add vte3-select-text. not git this time. add youtube-dl-git. mostly fixing dependencies here and there, the odd revert, mostly version bumps. (at github.com)
<ack006>	just bootstrapped arch using my makefile based bootstrap/provision contraption, ~58 seconds from creating an image file to a working i3 setup, not bad :-)
<tomty89>	angerctl :o
<dacoit>	codebam: after you restart mediatomb.service, have you seen if status had any errors
<usr13>	i 'ln -s /dev/sr0 /dev/dvd'  but it gets deleted on reboot. how can i keep the configuration?
<tomty89>	usr13: udev rule
<earnestly>	usr13: ...why?
<codebam>	dacoit: no i didnt see any errors. it shows that its starting, but nothing works. http://sprunge.us/ibbu
<usr13>	need it for dvd playback by mythtv's internal media player.
<earnestly>	this mythtv sounds terrible :/
<usr13>	tomty89: where does it go?
<teraflop>	heh

<earnestly>	as tomty89 said though, a udev rule can do it.

<sudokode>	meh
<earnestly>	vdev?
<ack006>	earnestly: or you can wing it using tmpfiles.d config
<ack006>	:)
<usr13>	earnestly: what is terrible about having an internal media player that will play dvd's?
<earnestly>	ack006: you can, but there's a race condition when dev/sr0 is available and when tmpfiles are run
<ack006>	ah i see
<earnestly>	usr13: nothing is terrible about that (except not reusing already working, good codebases)
<dacoit>	codebam: /var/lib/mediatomb/.mediatomb is owned by and visible to root, are you sure its not regenerated
<tomty89>	usr13: btw can read /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/60-cdrom_id.rules for reference
<codebam>	actually. it shows that its loading my previous settings from /var/lib/mediatomb/ even though its not there anymore
<codebam>	dacoit: its not even there
<dacoit>	codebam: are you running ls or sudo ls?
<codebam>	ls
<d_garbage>	might be handy to paste output rather than describe it
<codebam>	but vim cant open the config file with sude
<codebam>	s/sude/sudo
<earnestly>	codebam: sudoedit
<codebam>	earnestly: okay
<d_garbage>	pseudo }:]
<tomty89>	sudokode:
<d_garbage>	lol
<earnestly>	codebam: sudoedit creates a temporary file, lets you edit that, then copies it when you're done
<earnestly>	codebam: so you don't have to run an editor, with full shell execution, as root...
<earnestly>	(rvim exists for that though)
<codebam>	earnestly: ah cool thats good to know. still cant find the file tho lol :p
<earnestly>	codebam: sudo ls -a
<sudokode>	._.
<earnestly>	or sudo -s, and ls -a
<codebam>	yea. its still not there
<earnestly>	then it's not there
<codebam>	no mediatomb folder in /var/lib
<earnestly>	directory*
<codebam>	dacoit: what did you do to get it to regenerate it?
<dacoit>	systemctl restart mediatomb
<codebam>	hmm. still nothing
<tomty89>	is it because of the ownership of /var/lib/mediatomb
<codebam>	tomty89: no. its not even there
<wmunny>	hello im using the option options usbhid mousepoll=1 for my mouse (it supports 1000hz) but when i test it i just have a 500hz any one knows how can i get it fix ?
<tomty89>	not the . one
<tomty89>	codebam: just /var/lib/mediatomb
<tomty89>	codebam: is it owned by mediatomb
<codebam>	yes i know. /var/lib/mediatomb is gone. i deleted it to try to get it to regenerate it
<tomty89>	ugh
<tomty89>	mkdir and chown? *shrug*
<dacoit>	chown mediatomb:mediatomb
<codebam>	i'll try it
<earnestly>	dacoit: how can he do that if the directory isn't there?
<dacoit>	he has to create it
<dacoit>	i just reproduced error by deleting /var/lib/mediatomb. restart enters failed state
<codebam>	okay. done. now i'll restart it
<trivia_man>	what format does a usb stick have to be to make a windows usb install
<tomty89>	what's a "windows usb install"
<codebam>	that worked :)
<codebam>	thank you so much earnestly, tomty89, and dacoit :)
<trivia_man>	tomty89: uh i mean an install usb
<dacoit>	cheers
<trivia_man>	to flash a windows iso on
<teraflop>	tomty89: a think made with windvdusbtool from a windows system
<dacoit>	no fs is needed then.
<tomty89>	teraflop: windows live medium? heh
<dacoit>	indeed
<sudokode>	wtf
<sudokode>	you can create gifs on youtube now?
<tomty89>	though windows live is a trademark
<teraflop>	tomty89: windows installation media from a usb stick
<sudokode>	that is so sick
<sudokode>	they added a meme generator
<teraflop>	you cant do dd qith such isos
<codebam>	you can use mini windows xp
<teraflop>	with*
<codebam>	but its xp...
<tomty89>	probably ntfs anyway i bet
<trivia_man>	i need to format the usb, i just don't know to what format
<tomty89>	or do they dare to use exfat now
<teraflop>	uhm xp meh
<sudokode>	hm. only on some videos
<tomty89>	teraflop: classics from m$
<teraflop>	yeah, i wonder if one can do a bootable xp usb with unetbooting
<tomty89>	trivia_man: didn't the guide teaching you how to "flash" the iso tell you?
<trivia_man>	what guide
<kaliiiixx>	tomty89: it does not wrk.
<tomty89>	what doesn't work
<tomty89>	trivia_man: no guide? how do you plan to flash the iso?
<trivia_man>	ah i forgot that dd formats it
<tomty89>	nooo
<tomty89>	so teraflop was right
<teraflop>	trivia_man: dd a windows ido to an usb ... good luck :p
<teraflop>	iso* sorry
<trivia_man>	okay, what am i doing wrong
<teraflop>	all of it
<trivia_man>	i would do it with winusb, but their site is down and i can't get the tarball, yaourt can't access it either
<tomty89>	trivia_man: you are not doing wrong, just have invalid expectation
<trivia_man>	tomty89: okay, which part is invalid?
<tomty89>	that the iso is "unflashable"?
<tomty89>	i mean that "the iso is flashable" is invalid
<trivia_man>	i never said any iso was unflashable

<sudokode>	the researchers used a technique called directed evolution; they used bacteria to create the enzyme and inserted particular mutations in the bacteria’s dna to make the enzyme even more powerful. after cultivating the bacteria over five generations, the enzyme became 170 times more effective.
<sudokode>	that's neat

<teraflop>	try wine with that winusb thing or try winudb from aur trivia_man

<sudokode>	trivia_man: there are about 10 guides online that will direct you on how to do this with any iso
<sudokode>	xp, vista, 7, 8
<tomty89>	sudokode: i'm just worried if it's permanent enough
<tomty89>	sudokode: what if it's reverted after a few days
<sudokode>	tomty89: yes, it's very permanent. i don't think the idea is to give it to donors though
<sudokode>	the idea is to use it after the blood is donated
<sudokode>	once it chomps off the antigens, they're gone
<tomty89>	hmm
<sudokode>	the problem was making that process effective enough to allow the blood to be universal

<earnestly>	dhts are just kind of cool
<pandb>	it's just lines and lines of that ^
<d_garbage>	it's much more civilised than torrents because it punishes leaching. the more you upload the higher download priority you get
<earnestly>	torrents don't encode policy, it's just a clever data transfer mechanism
<earnestly>	cern uses it for linux distribution
<earnestly>	and i can't find the article which talks about it anymore :/
<teraflop>	d_garbage: i hate the choked thing
<d_garbage>	you might have to wait a couple of months to get a file, but you will get it nowhere else

<earnestly>	d_garbage: bbc owns it, they use it
<d_garbage>	like how the legendarily never repeated blakes 7, one of the bbc's all time classics
<d_garbage>	they*
<d_garbage>	any of you youngsters don't know blakes 7, there's a really good 2-part 'making of' on youtube

<pandb>	that's the kernel i have
<d_garbage>	a very british vision of a distopian future
<pandb>	is it the arch way to install the newest stable kernel?
<earnestly>	yes
<earnestly>	upgrade
<pandb>	i think i'm starting to understand
<pandb>	:)
<earnestly>	arch is rolling release
<d_garbage>	only in a british show would you have the 'hero' to be so flawed :p
<ahtapot>	did work thanks
<bushido_>	alad: i do got the colors to fix
<bushido_>	but xterm works with those

<ryanvade>	hello everyone.  can anyone help me with wps office?
<sudokode>	ah
<ryanvade>	wps is complaining about missing cups libraries
<sudokode>	wps?
<ryanvade>	kingsoft office writer
<sudokode>	that acronym is wildly confusing
<sudokode>	anyway, what's it saying about the missing libs?
<ryanvade>	missing cups libraries. cannot access the printer. when i click print, wps segfaults
<sudokode>	fun
<sudokode>	how'd you install this?
<ryanvade>	technically its in alpha.  this is the only problem i have had in a very long time.  its available in the aur
<sudokode>	i686 or x86_64?
<ryanvade>	its i686 but i am on x86_64.  i have lib32-libcups installed
<sudokode>	weird
<sudokode>	i don't suppose it mentions the version anywhere?
<ryanvade>	of wps? 9.1.0.4945
<sudokode>	no, the lib it's looking for
<ryanvade>	i used ldd on it and found that it is using libcups.so.2 .
<sudokode>	hm
<sudokode>	not sure what to tell you then. everything seems to be in order
<sudokode>	you might have to ask kingsoft
<ryanvade>	libcups32 does not have a libcups.so.2 but it does have libcups.so so i symlinked it. did not fix it.  i also noticed that libcups.so is missing libgnutls.so.28 and the version in gnutls is libgnutls.so.30
<earnestly>	no symlinking manually plx
<ryanvade>	it didn't help anyway. :)
<ryanvade>	i think libcups is broke because of gnutls upgrade
<sudokode>	libcups /usr/lib/libcups.so.2
<sudokode>	hm
<sudokode>	oh lib32
<ryanvade>	32bit though
<sudokode>	multilib/lib32-libcups  /usr/lib32/libcups.so.2
<sudokode>	there's no update for it either
<ryanvade>	i reinstalled lib32-libcups and it did not have it...this is odd.
<sudokode>	pkgfile -l lib32-libcups
<sudokode>	!pkgfile
<phrik>	pkgfile is a tool to find out what package owns a file, even if said package is not installed. pacman -s pkgfile; pkgfile -u
<sudokode>	anyway, i'm audi
<ryanvade>	pkgfile is showing it as part of lib32-libcups....hmm. thank you
<mrelendig>	kittypack is also usefull
<ntzrmtthihu777>	so... apparently having an account on the aur doesn't get you one on the bbs?
<namarrgon>	nope, you'll also need a separate one for the bugtracker.
<ntzrmtthihu777>	interesting. anywho, that new issue with systemd and sysfs paths eh?
<namarrgon>	what issue?
<ntzrmtthihu777>	https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=196640
<phrik>	title: systemd device dev-disk-by\{stuff} appeared twice with sysfs diff path / system administration / arch linux forums (at bbs.archlinux.org)
<namarrgon>	that seems to be informational only, no?
<ntzrmtthihu777>	ran into this myself today, kinda dumb issue since it doesn't seem to make any difference.
<namarrgon>	so there is no issue?
<ntzrmtthihu777>	not really, i suppose. just making conversation.
<bpeak>	anybody knows why when i press alt+b in termite it works correctly, but when i press it in xterm i get the â character?
<ntzrmtthihu777>	compose key?
<ntzrmtthihu777>	possibly that xterm has a better relation with that sort of thing. i remember once i was trying to setup some .xcompose combos, they worked in xterm but not other terms.
<ntzrmtthihu777>	so perhaps you're using the alt that the system thinks is the compose key, termite ignores it, xterm takes it as such.
<lyonsb>	phrik admins, maybe add a !breathe command that echos "take a breath."  or "whooooaaa, slow down, take a deep breath" into chat?  maybe not?  just floating it.
<shadowkatstudios>	i'm a bad person. so, my homeserver's hdd died. now i'm going to replace it with a  flash drive. but it gets worse, i'm going to use one of my old ex-linux external hdds with a swap partition as swap

<shadowkatstudios>	waitaminute
<shadowkatstudios>	i have a backup server
<shadowkatstudios>	sort of
<ntzrmtthihu777>	good to hear :)
<shadowkatstudios>	i can leave this running apache2 while i get the other one working
<bpeak>	ntzrmtthihu777: the problem was that i needed to add "xterm*metasendsescape: true" in my xresources for some reason. thanks for the help though (:
<lyonsb>	ntzrmtthihu777, flash --> flesh?
<dagle>	i want fika.
<ntzrmtthihu777>	lyonsb: hmm?
<ntzrmtthihu777>	bpeak: glad to be of service :)
<ntzrmtthihu777>	lyonsb: oh, just reread the homeserver lol
<ntzrmtthihu777>	yah, funny stuff.

<jamesbond-4711>	hi
<jamesbond-4711>	is there a way to save a video from http://www.myvideo.de?
<d_garbage>	jamesbond-4711, youtube-dl --list-extractors   | grep myvideo
<beest>	(spoilers: it's there)
<jamesbond-4711>	d_garbage: i already tried youtube-dl, but all i get is: "unsupported url" (although your command above gives "myvideo" as output)
<hiptobecubic>	jamesbond-4711, are you quoting the url properly?
<beest>	i'd test but it's geo-ip'd
<hiptobecubic>	'?' makes bash upset
<halosghost>	it's a shell glob
<halosghost>	use single quotes
<jamesbond-4711>	hiptobecubic: i used double quotes...
<jamesbond-4711>	hiptobecubic: but single quotes don't work as well
<halosghost>	define “don't work”
<jamesbond-4711>	error: unsupported url
<halosghost>	post the exact youtube-dl command you're running
<jamesbond-4711>	youtube-dl 'http://www.myvideo.de/serien/der-lack-ist-ab'
<beest>	myvideo.de works according to the german archwiki and doesn't work according to random bug reports
<halosghost>	ahh
<halosghost>	bummer
<jamesbond-4711>	i was hoping there may be another tool for that site except youtube-dl
<halosghost>	back in the day, quvi might have been able to do it
<beest>	many geo-ip'd sites seem to fall on and off youtube-dl, ostensibly because they're more troublesome to test
<ph0x>	 i use net video hunter
<beest>	that already sounds like a porn site in of itself
<jamesbond-4711>	ph0x: that does not even claim to work with myvideo
<ph0x>	it still might
<dacoit>	lol
<ph0x>	works with alot of things with me
<jamesbond-4711>	could you try this? - http://www.myvideo.de/serien/der-lack-ist-ab

<reactormonk>	beest, yup
<reactormonk>	terminal works just fine
<beest>	beside the point anyway, that's likely font rendering, not locale issues
<reactormonk>	yup
<ph0x>	did you fuck with your font folder
<edit>	nicklist.pl
<ph0x>	if so, put that shit back
<beest>	is that the gtk or the qt wireshark?
<reactormonk>	ph0x, nope
<reactormonk>	i think it's gtk
<reactormonk>	yup
<beest>	are only gtk apps affected?
<pid1>	is there a preferred/recommended graphical utility for editing whiskermenu entries?
<reactormonk>	beest, also window titles, but yes, kde aren't
<dacoit>	what font is listed in your .gtkrc?
<reactormonk>	dacoit, i had a .gtkrc-2.0 which i just deleted and restarted wireshark, didn't help
<ntzrmtthihu777>	any under ~/.config/?
<dacoit>	what about the settings.ini in .config/gtk-3.0//
<reactormonk>	doesn't exist
<reactormonk>	nope, nothing in .config/gtk-2.0 either
<reactormonk>	nope, it's not a gtk-only problem, also when using the kde launcher i get the same problem
<case_of>	hello
<case_of>	i've a little question, about a twitter client called corebird which available in aur, should i take the stable release, or the git version ?
<case_of>	i do not found the release date of the stable release
<reactormonk>	what kinda font library could i use to circumvent the problem?
<case_of>	it seams to be released on march 28th of this year
<case_of>	sounds good for me
<kaligne>	hello everyone. i have a problem i tried cloning my irtuabox arch linux partitions on my usb stick. cloning of root and home partition did not reveal any error, but somehow i cannot boot from the us stick. would you help me? i paste all the steps i did here : http://sprunge.us/ztiv
<jswagner>	case_of: depends on whether or not you can tolerate breakage of your twitter client
<delumimator>	(delumimator) hey got a question. one it friend of mine suggested tha by overclocking the cpu i only increase responsiveness aka faster multitasking but actually reduce single application performance as the cpu spends more time switching between processes. is this correct? we were talking about the con kolivas kernel specifically and if it actually boosts performance.
<kaligne>	i am sorry there were few typos. reading this link will be more understandable: http://sprunge.us/herq
<dacoit>	why cat instead of dd? i suppose it should work but i've never tried that in place of dd
<ntzrmtthihu777>	fack udev rules are funky xd
<case_of>	jswagner: yes, but i don't know the delay between stable release, and knowing twitter, they could break the client functionality at any moment, which could be fixed quickly on the git version
<jswagner>	case_of: in which case an update to the stable version would follow shortly after
<potmo>	kaligne: did you run mkconfig?
<dacoit>	kaligne: can you paste fdisk -l
<jswagner>	case_of: i think it's an official gnome application at this point, so it's not likely that the stable will leave you hanging waiting for the next big release
<potmo>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/grub#install_to_external_usb_stick
<phrik>	title: grub - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<case_of>	jswagner: ok then i will choose the stable version
<kaligne>	potmo: i cannot find any mkconfig command
<dacoit>	grub-mkconfig
<kaligne>	dacoit: i get this output running fdisk -l: fdisk: cannot open /proc/partitions: no such file or directory
<dacoit>	kaligne: i think that's because youre in a vm.
<kaligne>	dacoit: wait i totlly forgot the grub-mkconfig command. i am giving it a try righth now. i am not in a vm anymore. i copied the vm partitions to an usb stick. now i can run commands directly from ubuntu
<case_of>	jswagner: oh there is a litlle problem, all the icons images are missing :/
<kaligne>	does the /root flder has to be mounted in order to make a grub-install?
<case_of>	(i'm on kde)
<jswagner>	case_of: sounds like you're missing a dependency
<ntzrmtthihu777>	herp derp. apparently my laptop has an accelerometer built in o.0
<pirithous>	throw it against a wall and take a measurement
<case_of>	jswagner: i've installed all the dependencies written in the aur package page
<jswagner>	case_of: that doesn't mean the dependencies are accurate
<dacoit>	kaligne: your command will look something like grub-install --target=i386-pc --recheck --debug --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sdb. yes to your question btw
<case_of>	jswagner: okay
<ansikt>	hey guys.  is there a way to deeply merge one directory into another?
<potmo>	kaligne: $ cat /dev/sda4 /dev/sdb4 did you leave out >
<ansikt>	something like rsync -vaz, but with the critical difference that i'd like to move the files instead of copy them
<ntzrmtthihu777>	ansikt: tar one to stdout; process that in the other reading the first into another tar?
<ansikt>	(because, i have a lot of files :))
<ntzrmtthihu777>	eh, copy/delete.
<ansikt>	ntzrmtthihu777, that would be much slower.  also, i don't have enough diskspace without a lot of manual intervention
<kaligne>	potmo: no that's a typo i overlooked. i ran the commands yesterday quite frankly :)
<ansikt>	there's a no-clobber option for mv, but that only gives me one level of depth, not two
<case_of>	jswagner: i don't find information about which package i'm missing
<ansikt>	the exact case is that i'm trying to move my music library over
<jswagner>	case_of: try filing a bug against the package
<case_of>	ok
<jswagner>	case_of: corebird works for me, but i'm a gnome user, so i probably already have whatever is needed installed.
<d_garbage>	case_of, https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/choqok/
<phrik>	title: arch linux - choqok 1.5-3 (x86_64) (at www.archlinux.org)
<dacoit>	ansikt: rsync has --remove-source-files. but be sure to do a --dry-run first
<ansikt>	and merge my old archived version with my newer, cherry picked version.  file structure looks like ~/music/[artist]/[album]/[song].  mv -n should let me merge in one leve, but how do i say -- for every folder, move all the files in that folder into another folder of the same name in a different directory
<kaligne>	coming back soon
<dacoit>	ansikt: if you ask me, create a tertiary directory "merged" and rsync the two separate directories into it, if you use --link-dest, hardlinks will prevent you running out of space
<ansikt>	dacoit, ooooh, i didn't know about that.  that should fix the issue, but i'd still have to make 500gigs of io, which i'd like to avoid.
<ntzrmtthihu777>	ansikt: hehe, that's basically how i do my music :)
<ansikt>	dacoit, link-dest sounds perfect.  you're a guru, man!
<dacoit>	hah nah, its just how i do incremental backups (following guides by real gurus) :p
<case_of>	d_garbage: i will try this!
<case_of>	d_garbage: oh but it's another client...
<case_of>	i wanted to try corebird
<d_garbage>	case_of, there's also an experimental frameworks version ported by our very own andrea scarpino http://blog.andreascarpino.it/choqok-and-kde-frameworks/
<phrik>	title: choqok is using kde frameworks (at blog.andreascarpino.it)
<tomty89>	+--
<d_garbage>	case_of, well now you have options
<case_of>	d_garbage: i prefer not installing experimental versions :)
<case_of>	d_garbage: i installed it from the official repo
<case_of>	d_garbage: and do you know which package is missing ? :s
<jswagner>	case_of: if his solution is "just use something else", you can assume he doesn't know the answer :)
<edit>	b²
<edit>	?
<kaligne>	dacoit potmo:  i tried ocne but mu usb still wont boot. "now i read again the arch wiki and it says :assume your usb stick's first partition is fat32 and its partition is /dev/sdy1 ". i assume they are referring to my root partition, which is the second one, and it is labeled as ext4 partition, not fat32.. is there something wrong here?
<d_garbage>	case_of, so an a version supported by an arch dev is out but some random stuff from the aur is ok? heh
<d_garbage>	jswagner, fyi you can't file bugs against aur packages, the aur is unsupported
<jswagner>	d_garbage: we're talking about the stable package
<ntzrmtthihu777>	so lets see if we broke anything :)
<jswagner>	oh, i see, corebird isn't in official repo
<case_of>	d_garbage: i don't understand what you mean
<case_of>	how is done choqok is not really interesting from my point of view
<case_of>	anyway, i've asked the project maintainer on github
<case_of>	i'm waiting for his answer
<d_garbage>	out of interest i installed corebird, seems to be working just fine here
<case_of>	d_garbage: what's your desktop environment ?
<d_garbage>	can't say i like it much though, especially since it's using the awful new 'flat' theme
<d_garbage>	kde (kdebase4)
<case_of>	i'm using kde 15.04 with plasma 5.2
<case_of>	do you have a package i don't have ?
<d_garbage>	it also doesn't seem to have a 'systray' icon?
<d_garbage>	case_of, how did you build it?
<case_of>	d_garbage: using the corebird package from aur
<d_garbage>	makepkg -sicr ?
<case_of>	d_garbage: just makepkg
<d_garbage>	you generally use -s to install deps (-r removes build deps)
<case_of>	ok
<d_garbage>	man makepkg
<case_of>	i'm actualy reading it
<shanemikel>	is there a simple suid wrapper for bash scripts that allows people to run it without the ability to read it?
<case_of>	i'm not using -s -r because i haven't configured sudo (and i don't want ^^)
<shanemikel>	or any shebang scripts for that matter
<d_garbage>	case_of, you don't need sudo
<case_of>	d_garbage: makepkg tells me it needs it to install dependencies
<d_garbage>	nope
<case_of>	really ?
<d_garbage>	not for a long time now
<d_garbage>	yeah like years
<d_garbage>	it will use su if sudo is not available
<case_of>	it stills asking me to use sudo
<d_garbage>	then there's something wrong with your system
<case_of>	:(
<d_garbage>	"==> warning: cannot find the sudo binary. will use su to acquire root privileges."
<case_of>	mmmh
<d_garbage>	if you don't use sudo, uninstal it
<ph0x>	^
<scimmia>	case_of, do you have it installed but not configured?
<case_of>	i have uninstalled it now
<rgb-one>	hey
<ph0x>	why use sudo
<d_garbage>	why not?
<case_of>	scimmia: that was probably that
<rgb-one>	how would i go about making a group pkgbuild?
<ph0x>	because su
<ph0x>	you use ubuntu?
<scimmia>	rgb-one, be more specific
<rgb-one>	like for example a gnome group pkgbuild
<ph0x>	when ever i see something talking about sudo
<ph0x>	im like
<ph0x>	ubuntu user
<case_of>	:)
<d_garbage>	odd
<scimmia>	rgb-one, if you're just talking about a package group, you just add the group to each pkgbuild
<case_of>	because lots of sudo users runs ubuntu
<ph0x>	oh i was gonna ask
<ph0x>	can i put together collections of packages
<ph0x>	like on a dvd
<d_garbage>	sudo is a very useful program allowing you to make fine grained permissions.
<ph0x>	i know they probably go out of date quick
<ph0x>	d_garbage: i know
<d_garbage>	!shrug
<phrik>	¯\(º_o)/¯
<case_of>	i'm still not understanding sudo is working :)
<case_of>	how*
<case_of>	once i tried with the sudo conf file
<case_of>	i have stopped here
<d_garbage>	get rid of it then, it's just getting in the way as it is
<case_of>	d_garbage: what are your gtk related packages ?
<d_garbage>	this is an old install there's a bunch of that kind of stuff in here
<d_garbage>	besides just installing random packages does feel like the right way to go about fixing something

<case_of>	d_garbage: it will be the opportunity to test what you said about makepkg :)
<d_garbage>	if you installed corebird i think you should have it though, if i understand that correctly. it should be installed as part of a chain of deps
<d_garbage>	ie something else you have installed has that as a dep

<case_of>	so it will not fix the problem

<bshah>	nicoadamo: never had that.. but from what i know it is upto device...
<case_of>	nicoadamo: probably an android security parameter, do you have a passcode on your lockscreen ?
<bshah>	y u no use kde connect? ;) *hint*
<case_of>	bshah: i'm not sure it will solve the problem :)
<nicoadamo>	bshah: yes, i've got a password to unlock. that behavior seems reasonable, but it's annoying checking all the time if the screen is going to be locked
<d_garbage>	too much security!
<case_of>	nicoadamo: is there a setting on your phone to disable *temporarily* the security feature ?
<bshah>	case_of: iirc kdeconnect is not using mtp.. i maybe wrong but..
<case_of>	i absolutely do not know :)
<case_of>	i do not like smartphones
<bshah>	:d
<d_garbage>	not sure if i like them or not, certainly i can't afford one
<case_of>	(and smartwatch are worse, but i'm off topic so i'm stopping now)
<shanemikel>	if i install linux-lts, will grub automatically generate a boot entry for it when i run grub-mkconfig ?
<d_garbage>	case_of, that's up to you, it's not technically off topic though
<d_garbage>	!whatisontopic
<phrik>	the main topic of the channel is support for and discussion about arch linux. talk about general software and hardware is ok if it does not interfere with the main topic of the channel. anything else is handled on a case-by-case basis at the op's discretion. (source: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/irc_channel#.23archlinux_rules)
<d_garbage>	shanemikel, not sure, check the manual
<d_garbage>	grub for me comes under the category of done it once, now forget all about it
<nicoadamo>	case_of: i'll check... but i think there aren't many settings for mtp
<case_of>	nicoadamo: unfortunately
<case_of>	nicoadamo: that's also why i do not like smartphones :)
<d_garbage>	or turn the auto-lock itself off? if i understand the problem correctly
<d_garbage>	the trouble with that is remembering to turn it on again which is kind of the point of auto-lock in the first place :p
<case_of>	d_garbage: good idea, i did not though of this
<case_of>	nicoadamo: you could disable the autolock
<d_garbage>	i once got a call from my ex boss, which consisted of 15 mins of him walking to work :p
<shanemikel>	d_garbage: do you know of a suid wrapper that i can use to hide the contents of scripts from users that run them? it should be reasonably secure, though i don't intend to use it to wrapp a suid root script
<case_of>	d_garbage: he is lucky to only 15 minutes to go to work
<case_of>	only take*
<d_garbage>	shanemikel, what are you trying to do?
<d_garbage>	i also once recorded a 40 min cycle to work on my mp3 player by accident. still got it, it's funny
<nicoadamo>	case_of: sure, i'll try that next time i plug the phone... you don't like smartphone? jajaja, they're like a necessary evil these days...
<shanemikel>	d_garbage: i'm trying to call a shell script from php on a webserver, without allowing users to access the page, and i'd rather do it with userspace than funky configurations of the server itself
<d_garbage>	i did that journey for many years so i recognised all the bits from the audio
<shanemikel>	d_garbage: that is, access the text of the script
<case_of>	nicoadamo: i'm liking the rare moments when you are totally disconnected from the rest of the world
<d_garbage>	shanemikel, not something i'd know about personally. obviously you want to be careful about security then
<d_garbage>	shanemikel, what function does this script provide? perhaps there's a better way is what i'm getting at
<d_garbage>	what's the actual goal
<nicoadamo>	case_of: of course! even more if you are introvert (my case), those moments are necessary!
<case_of>	nicoadamo: i'm a little like that too
<reactormonk>	any flag for cp to overwrite the target?
<d_garbage>	man cp ?
<d_garbage>	reactormonk, wait you mean 'not overwrite' target?
<reactormonk>	ah, good old -f
<reactormonk>	somehow didn't find it on my first pass
<shadowkatstudios>	is it a little crazy to ask my 800mhz via c3 machine with 512mib ram to mount an 18gb archive?
<shadowkatstudios>	it's been going for like, 10 minutes. maybe 18gb of .tar.gz is just too much for it.
<d_garbage>	oh
<case_of>	18gb oo
<shadowkatstudios>	archive of /srv and /etc
<nicoadamo>	shadowkatstudios: wow... that's taking too long. 10 min for only mounting?
<shadowkatstudios>	aaand i kernel paniced it
<shanemikel>	hmm, really the goal is to be able to write shell scripts that are run from php scripts, there is no specific scripting goal yet.
<case_of>	shadowkatstudios: huhu :)
<shadowkatstudios>	nicoadamo: it's an 800mhz x86 box from around 2000, it's not surprising
<halfwit>	you need to let it go.
<case_of>	shadowkatstudios: prefer a more recent computer
<shadowkatstudios>	guess i'll try to use it over sshfs on my haswell i3
<nicoadamo>	jajaja
<shadowkatstudios>	aaand i crashed it again
<case_of>	i can try corebird on a virtual machine running gnome
<case_of>	sounds good
<case_of>	shadowkatstudios: congratulations :)
<case_of>	shadowkatstudios: your file is too big
<nicoadamo>	shadowkatstudios: via went out of the processors market, right?
<case_of>	nicoadamo: since long long time ago
<nicoadamo>	yep, just read it focused then on mobo chipsets and audio. kind of sad because the more companies available, more challenge among them and innovation
<strayarch>	if i wanted to put a desktop/server between my wifi router and wan, for advanced filtering, what would be the best way to do so? an inline proxy like squid or apache?
<shadowkatstudios>	nicoadamo: via's strong point was low power usage
<shadowkatstudios>	like, intel is only now managing to catch up to their 5w idle
<case_of>	nicoadamo: on pcs today, there is still just intel and amd
<case_of>	now arm plateform emerges on pcs
<case_of>	:)
<shadowkatstudios>	i've seen laptops, tablets and phones with arm, but no desktops.
<case_of>	shadowkatstudios: look at the raspberry pi 2 model b
<case_of>	shadowkatstudios: it is able to do a lot of things !
<shadowkatstudios>	rpis still seem like embedded boards.
<utack>	shadowkatstudios and sadly that is the only thing intel is focused on, because no one else is in the high end market and arm in the low power area
<shadowkatstudios>	the closest we've come to a desktop board for arm i've seen is the cubieboard.
<shadowkatstudios>	still, some form of atx board with pci-e would be awesome for arm.
<case_of>	on a desktop computer the power usage does not count
<case_of>	it does not make sense
<d_garbage>	does if you're thinking green
<utack>	lol
<shadowkatstudios>	appeal to the hippies! :p
<case_of>	not as much as on a laptop which has a battery
<utack>	10w is going ot kill the environment in the end, for real!
<noremi>	does anyone have experience with multiple sound cards in wine?
<case_of>	utack: xd
<noremi>	winecfg only gets my first card, not my second
<case_of>	my graphic card can use 300w power usage at its peak :)
<shadowkatstudios>	i'd like an arm desktop - i could still use my cheap, low-end, old gpu, but people wouldn't tell me to install windows like an animal
<d_garbage>	well i'm a bit cynical about that but really when it comes to computers there are just so many of them now in all the businesses around the world that it's likely to be a significant thing
<case_of>	i'm destroying the environement !
<d_garbage>	large companies have policies about power management of their computers
<d_garbage>	in a very small way we all are
<case_of>	d_garbage: and spending so much more money on their equipments :)
<utack>	yeah but not because it matters, just because they want to have a reputation
<ph0x>	it matters
<ph0x>	esp if you do pv
<ph0x>	esp at night
<d_garbage>	well dunno about that, there are an awful lot of computers in the world by now
<shadowkatstudios>	i want an arm server, because it would use even less power than the thinkpad t400 with a flash drive i currently use
<ph0x>	my computers are over half my energy usage at night
<case_of>	i don't have enough money to save the environment personally :)
<homerj>	most business computers are just on a lease
<utack>	it is not like it does for the environment, or do you think some alien cares if it writes down 2314 as last human extinct or 2314 and 10 seconds
<d_garbage>	and not to mention power costs money ;)
<homerj>	get them 1,000 at a time
<homerj>	plug them in, spit out a new image to them all and call it a day
<d_garbage>	what about the hard drives?
<homerj>	unless you have a moron running it, then they pay people who graduated from itt tech to reinstall windows manually
<case_of>	d_garbage: the difference for me, what the power costs to me, and the price of the low power usage, my choice is quick done ;)
<homerj>	d_garbage, what about hard drives?
<case_of>	low power usage equipment*
<homerj>	you don't let people write anything to their hd by policy
<d_garbage>	ah
<case_of>	the same hardware as i have in low power edition costs 4 times more money
<case_of>	my pc has cost around 800€ which could make 900$ or 1k$
<homerj>	heck, you do things like make an updated image on thursday, push them out to everyone over the weekend
<shadowkatstudios>	so, i've got sudo, htop and vim. any other essentials i want?
<homerj>	and it just deletes what was there
<case_of>	imagine askiong me paying 4k$ for a pc
<case_of>	-o
<homerj>	get really fancy with it, you just have everyone use a thin client, and it's just some virtualized session
<d_garbage>	case_of, add up the cost of the power usage over its lifetime, who knows you might be surprised
<homerj>	wyse made some decent ones, dell bought them out a few years back
<d_garbage>	things have a nasty way of adding up to unexpectedly large amounts
<homerj>	don't know how they work now
<case_of>	d_garbage: not really
<case_of>	d_garbage: i'm still saving money :)
<d_garbage>	did you work it out then?
<d_garbage>	or are you just assuming/guessing/hoping for the best?
<shadowkatstudios>	can i use a single vnc port for multiple connections, each to a different session?
<case_of>	your second guess d_garbage
<case_of>	:d
<d_garbage>	case_of, once, when i gave up smoking, i worked out very roughly how much i'd spent on smoke and drink over the years. it was in the order of £100,000
<case_of>	shadowkatstudios: probably
<shadowkatstudios>	i wonder if i could do it based on password, like znc
<case_of>	znc is a bouncer
<case_of>	not a vnc server
<case_of>	:)
<case_of>	shadowkatstudios: but some vnc servers allows multiple connections
<case_of>	d_garbage: lot of money
<case_of>	d_garbage: but electricty is not the same
<case_of>	price
<case_of>	:)
<shadowkatstudios>	i know znc is a bouncer, but the way sessions work is username:password
<shadowkatstudios>	i was pondering differentiating sessions using that
<d_garbage>	case_of, you're missing the point i feel. i'm talking about the way that small things add up over time in ways which are not necessarily intuative
<case_of>	d_garbage: and i came from a taumatic abusively expensive company of computers as a user
<case_of>	:)
<d_garbage>	i'm not saying that your more expensive, low power computer would pay for itself, just that it might and it's hard to tell unless you do the math
<case_of>	and i wanted something a lot more affordable
<n00balert>	or meth
<case_of>	x)
<d_garbage>	in the same way that buying cheep in the long run can work out more expensive if a higher quality but more expensive thing lasts longer or is more efficient/reliable
<n00balert>	quality is relative?
<case_of>	d_garbage: don't worry, my hardware is not the cheapest
<case_of>	it's in high-end rage
<case_of>	range*
<d_garbage>	you see thet in business all the time. the company saves mony on equipment in the short term and then pays a fortune to maintain it and downtime
<n00balert>	case_of: you mean it's high grade?
<case_of>	what ?
<n00balert>	high quality and high grade
<case_of>	dunno
<n00balert>	class c hardware can be of high quality
<n00balert>	and class a hardware can be of low quality
<n00balert>	it depends
<d_garbage>	the classic example of this in my experience is building air conditioning,  though this may be a uk thing
<n00balert>	class=grade
<case_of>	i have an intel 4690, an asus r9 280 3gb, an asus h97-plus, 4 x4gb g.skill ripjawsx 1600mhz cl7
<case_of>	i have a crucial m500
<case_of>	a corsair cx600
<case_of>	so
<n00balert>	so you seem to have high grade and high quality equipment
<ph0x>	i have an hp 2000
<ph0x>	and an hp mini
<d_garbage>	i have ... er, well it works when you turn it on anyway }:]
<ph0x>	and a amd 64 athalon
<n00balert>	ouch
<n00balert>	that must hurt
<ph0x>	<3 xfce4
<n00balert>	lol
<case_of>	d_garbage: huhu
<case_of>	d_garbage: my pc is an excellent one
<d_garbage>	i'm jsut glad i have something at all and that it works. if anything breaks at the moment there is no way i can replace it
<case_of>	n00balert: i'm not really good english speaker ^^
<n00balert>	it's so good to procrastinate and even better when you finally fix the damn thing
<n00balert>	case_of: neither me i
<n00balert>	am
<d_garbage>	english as she is spoke
<n00balert>	english as it's spoke is broke
<case_of>	i love procastinating
<d_garbage>	actually that's a big advantage of english, it's very robust. you can mangle it all to hell and still be understood
<case_of>	my favorite hobby
<n00balert>	i wonder if they code in japanese in japan...or english?
<case_of>	d_garbage: i know that
<case_of>	n00balert: i was always wondering how they wrote in japan in their computers
<n00balert>	case_of: in japanese...i wonder  about 'coding'
<d_garbage>	i think because the core of the language is very small and everything else just got tacked on over the years from many other languages. someone like escondida could probably tell you more
<n00balert>	i used to work for a japanese  company...been there too
<case_of>	n00balert: yes i would say in japanese ^^
<n00balert>	d_garbage: shakespeare would disagree
<case_of>	n00balert: how are their keyboard ?
<d_garbage>	n00balert, not sure about that
<n00balert>	case_of: eng/jap
<case_of>	oo
<case_of>	i want to see that
<n00balert>	printed...
<n00balert>	psh
<n00balert>	search online :)
<n00balert>	(all) programming languages are written in english
<n00balert>	except assembly :p
<shadowkatstudios>	are we still comparing specs?
<case_of>	omg http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/macbookprojiskeyboard-1.jpg
<case_of>	shadowkatstudios: no :)
<shadowkatstudios>	oh :(
<d_garbage>	the funny thing about shakespere is that people seem to think it's fancy and sophisticated, whereas it was actually written and performed for ordinary people of the time
<n00balert>	lel
<case_of>	http://mc.pp.se/dc/kbd_large.jpg
<case_of>	these keyboards wtf
<shadowkatstudios>	n00balert: well, assembly is sort of english. machine code is just numbers, though.
<d_garbage>	it's actually very 'down to earth' it's just the language has changed somewhat making it slightly confusing and the things it talks about also
<d_garbage>	it's also realy quite dirty :p
<n00balert>	shadowkatstudios: i never cared for assembly...or any programming language for that matter
<shadowkatstudios>	case_of: an american keyboard with hiragana?
<shadowkatstudios>	i'd totally go for that
<case_of>	:o
<shadowkatstudios>	then i'd swap ctrl and caps lock
<shadowkatstudios>	and what the hell is the s1 key?
<n00balert>	i care about virtualization though
<sheep>	i juse have an ime to switch between us, us international, and japanese ime
<shadowkatstudios>	wait, is s1 the modifier to type japanese?
<case_of>	shadowkatstudios: i think :)
<sheep>	the kataka/hiragana/romaji key two keys to the right of the spacebar
<n00balert>	d_garbage: languages are never dirty...just useful
<d_garbage>	shakespere is packed with sex'n'violence, puts hollywood to shame :p
<case_of>	x)
<case_of>	your typo on his name
<shadowkatstudios>	can i get stickers for normal keys? like, ones i can place anywhere? i want to put a caps lock sticker on my ctrl and a ctrl on my caps lock
<n00balert>	if he was alive today he'd be packed with sex'n'drugs
<shadowkatstudios>	and maybe a diamond for my meta key
<devgrohl>	no
<n00balert>	and might have heard of arch linux...
<n00balert>	though nothing to write poetry about
<case_of>	shadowkatstudios: do you that overpriced keyboard which have lcd screen on each keys ?
<case_of>	do you want*
<n00balert>	wow
<shadowkatstudios>	case_of: no, considering i'm currently typing on a third-hand dell keyboard.
<shadowkatstudios>	budget, man.
<n00balert>	if my finger tips had eyes...i might consider that
<d_garbage>	shadowkatstudios, marker pen :p
<case_of>	shadowkatstudios: the optimus keyboard ^^
<d_garbage>	gaffer (duct) tape and magic marker :p
<case_of>	http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus/maximus/ the keyboard for just 1500$
<phrik>	title: optimus maximus keyboard (at www.artlebedev.com)
<shadowkatstudios>	is it mechanical?
<shadowkatstudios>	... it has the key set on the side
<shadowkatstudios>	damnit, i want that, i could actually replicate the sun layout
<case_of>	shadowkatstudios: pay it :p
<shadowkatstudios>	actually, are there any keyboards with that set of keys?
<shadowkatstudios>	like, the extra keys?
<siavoshkc>	i see there are a number of compression tools which come along arch
<siavoshkc>	gzip, bzip, tar, xz,...
<case_of_>	sorry time for my router to shutdown
<case_of_>	i'm back then
<siavoshkc>	and these are installed by default
<siavoshkc>	why do we really need all of them?
<scimmia>	siavoshkc, because they're very common compressions that are used everywhere
<scimmia>	and for the record, tar is not a compression tool
<case_of_>	i'm tired
<case_of_>	see ya later
<rena>	so when firefox shows popup notifications (e.g. for new mail) what program is responsible for displaying them?
<rena>	does firefox itself create those popup windows or is it e.g. libnotify?
<rena>	i'm wondering, because i hoped to change which screen they appear on, and firefox doesn't seem to allow to configure that
<threegen>	libnotify
<threegen>	change the settings in system -> preferences -> pop-up notifications.
<threegen>	at least on my mate arch system thats where it is.
<dacoit>	for me, firefox nightly would just use notify-send to my daemon of choice. the main version used something prettier than twmnd
<rena>	alright, and looks like i have notification-daemon installed...
<rena>	...but awesome window manager also provides its own listener for them? hmm
<rena>	i guess i'll uninstall notification-daemon and wait to get a new email :p
<koz_>	when i installed my graphics card a while ago, this caused me to not be able to use wired internet. i remember fixing it (in the os, *not* the hardware), but i don't rememeber how. now that same issue is back.
<koz_>	could someone help me a bit?
<koz_>	i was using dhcpcd, but when i try to bring it up manually, it fails.
<thrice>	i don't see how those are related at all
<dacoit>	koz_: do you see your ethernet interface when you type `ip a`?
<koz_>	dacoit: yes.
<gnea>	koz_: how do you usually call dhcpcd?
<koz_>	gnea: you mean, if i wanna bring it up manually?
<koz_>	sudo systemctl start dhcpcd@enp3s0.service
<dacoit>	koz_: and after stopping all network management services and dhcp services, dhcpcd <interface> doesnt work?
<gnea>	koz_: well, manually would be an abnormal process.
<koz_>	dacoit: what do i have to stop besides dhcpcd to try this?
<gnea>	koz_: okay. does it say anything in systemctl status dhcpcd@enp3s0.service ?
<dacoit>	dhcpcd should be all unless you are using something like networkmanager of systemd-networkd
<dacoit>	s/of/or
<koz_>	dacoit: definitely not using networkmanager, unsure about systemd-networkd.
<ph0x>	^
<ph0x>	networkmanager sucks
<gnea>	yes it does
<ph0x>	i used wicd still
<geomyidae_>	are we going to get an updated mono soon? :(
<dacoit>	koz_: if you didn't enable it, then dhcpcd is probably all you're using
<koz_>	it says 'failed to start dhcpcd on enp3s0'.
<thrice>	lol
<koz_>	dacoit: then it is all i'm using.
<thrice>	!wicd
<dacoit>	koz_: what error do you get when you try to manually run dhcpcd <iface>?
<gnea>	koz_: okay. try stopping it, then see if there's a zombied process of dhcpcd.
<koz_>	do i have to run it out of sudo?
<koz_>	or just normally?
<dacoit>	sudo
<gnea>	ps axf | grep dhcpcd
<dacoit>	pgrep
<dacoit>	-a
<koz_>	dacoit: i get a single message 'sending commands to master dhcpcd process' and then nothing
<dacoit>	well then there is some other dhcpcd service running.
<gnea>	dacoit: ah cool, new one for me
<causasui>	i have a software raid5 array with mdadm, as described in the wiki article on raid. a disk failed, and i i just installed the rma drive. am i just adding it to the array as described here, or is there more to it? https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/raid#adding_a_new_device_to_an_array
<phrik>	title: raid - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<koz_>	ok, fixed the second running dhcpcd. now it does this:
<dacoit>	koz_: that's your problem. run systemctl status dhcpcd.service and status dhcpcd@iface.service. which are enabled?
<koz_>	yeah, i had both. disabled the non-template one.
<koz_>	now, here's the error:
<codebam>	where is $plex_home?
<koz_>	control_open: connection refused.
<gnea>	codebam: echo $plex_home
<koz_>	then it tries to solicit an ipv6 router. fails. then times out.
<gnea>	koz_: just stop all instances altogether
<codebam>	gnea: its not a real variable
<codebam>	i dont know where plex has its home as
<koz_>	gnea: ok, stopped them all. gonna try and start again.
<gnea>	koz_: before you start, double check processes
<gnea>	codebam: sorry, i don't know what plex is
<dacoit>	dlna/upnp server
<gnea>	cool
<codebam>	yea
<koz_>	gnea: with all instances of dhcpcd off, i get the same result as before - it tries to solicit an ipv6 router, fails and times out.
<dacoit>	koz_: after disabling dhcpcd.service and enabling the template one, reboot. dhcpcd.service grabs that interface too soon during boot process and fux wit udev.
<koz_>	ok.
<shadowkatstudios>	http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/images/enhpc.gif this i want.
<koz_>	just rebooted. still same problem.
<dacoit>	same connection refused error too?
<gnea>	shadowkatstudios: that looks like a sun keyboard on steroids
<koz_>	connection's not refused this time - but it still times out when soliciting an ipv6 router.
<gnea>	koz_: did it at least get an ip this time?
<koz_>	it says there are none available, and then times out.
<koz_>	how can i check if it did?
<gnea>	ip a
<shadowkatstudios>	gnea: it's what you get when you combine a sun keyboard, a space cadet keyboard and an ibm 3270 keyboard
<gnea>	shadowkatstudios: very nice, when will the kickstarter happen?
<koz_>	it has a mac for link/ether and something under inet6 labelled 'scope link' at the end.
<koz_>	which i assume means it did not/
<shadowkatstudios>	gnea: probably never, it was on a blog http://segin-rr.blogspot.com.au/2010/06/discussion-on-keyboard-layouts.html
<phrik>	title: segin's blog of rantings and ravings: a discussion on keyboard layouts (at segin-rr.blogspot.com.au)
<shadowkatstudios>	i would very much like a keyboard like that.
<gnea>	koz_: if it's not showing any addresses afer inet and inet6, probably not
<koz_>	it's definitely not showing anything that looks like an ipv4 address.
<koz_>	i dunno if the thing after inet6 is an ipv6 address or not.
<koz_>	it's 5 numbers, separated by colons, all being 4 hex digits.
<koz_>	with a /64 at the end.
<dacoit>	yup
<dacoit>	thats ipv6
<gnea>	koz_: if it starts with fe80::yada/64, then that's the translated mac address
<gnea>	but that's not an ipv6 ip address
<dacoit>	woop
<koz_>	gnea: it looks like that. so yeah, no addresses for me. :(
<dacoit>	s
<codebam>	so no one knows where the plex home is?
<gnea>	koz_: on the first line, there should be something that says <broadcast,something,somethingelse>, what are those something elses?
<koz_>	multicast, up, lower_up
<aremis117>	my xorg didn't configure a monitor.  is there a way to have it configure itself?
<gnea>	koz_: okay, so the ethernet cable is plugged in securely on both ends...
<koz_>	lol... first thing i checked. :p
<gnea>	thought so, but for sanity-sake :)
<gnea>	koz_: how many results from this command: locate dhcpcd.service
<koz_>	i don't have a command called 'locate'.
<koz_>	ok, wtf.
<koz_>	it works now.
<koz_>	i changed where one cable was plugged into the switch....
<koz_>	sorry to bother you all with this everyone.... :(
<dacoit>	:-) lol
<koz_>	well, that's hardware problem #1 diagnosed. :p
<koz_>	the problem in that case was most definitely between the keyboard and the chair.
<gnea>	heh cool
<koz_>	i'm gonna get that damn switch replaced one of these days.
<gnea>	i was about to call the horse deceased...
<koz_>	yeah, well... figures.
<gnea>	hehe
<koz_>	i can diagnose a lot of stuff myself - this is one of the few times when i can't.
<koz_>	also, holy shit, just -syu'd, saw new kernel.
<koz_>	:d:d:d:d:d
<gnea>	been there, done that. sometimes it just takes a few other sets of perspectives.
<gnea>	yeah, been running 4.0 for a couple weeks now, it's decent
<zeltak>	hi all. perhaps there are arch user here using the lenovo x1 (3rd gen)?
<koz_>	good to know.
<koz_>	now i just have to see if my issues with nouveau and my card are something to worry about.
<rena>	wtf, why does "import -window root screenshot.png" make my pc speaker beep
<koz_>	(my monitor sometimes stops displaying anything halfway through boot time)
<gnea>	i prefer the vendor-based drivers
<dacoit>	first check if videocard is firmly seated :p
<koz_>	dacoit: could that be causing it?
<dacoit>	koz_: no not at all, i was just kidding
<causasui>	i have a software raid5 array with mdadm, as described in the wiki article on raid. a disk failed, and i i just installed the rma drive. am i just adding it to the array as described here, or is there more to it? https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/raid#adding_a_new_device_to_an_array
<phrik>	title: raid - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<koz_>	i've asked about it on #nouveau already.
<koz_>	they've been quite helpful about it previously.
<gnea>	koz_: dsub, dvi or hdmi connection?
<koz_>	gnea: dvi.
<gnea>	i used to have a dsub or dvi plugged in and would just start the screws a little and just leave it... then one day it would intermittently display, turned out the cable was being yanked and pulled out a little
<gnea>	after that, i made sure to screw them both in all the way lol
<koz_>	i think they're both screwed in all the way, but i'll check in any case.
<rena>	seems i need to use -silent to make `import` not beep... silly
<koz_>	rena: go figure. :p
<rena>	(of course the manual doesn't mention
<rena>	"beep", only "bell", so i missed it)
<rena>	(damn enter key)
<koz_>	also, is there any particular reason why we're still on gcc 4.9.2?
<gnea>	koz_: i just did an update and it's on 5.1.0
<koz_>	gnea: weird....
<threegen>	4.9.2 isn't _that_ old...
<koz_>	threegen: i'm one of those horrible 'must use newest thing' people. :p
<threegen>	i run repo-ck too...doesn't mean it's good. bleeding edge is pretty bad. gotta have a _few_ days to catch up. repock doesn't even work right now. :)
<scimmia>	koz_, allan says there are still a few bugs blocking it from going to core
<scimmia>	it is in testing, though, if you want it
<koz_>	scimmia: thanks.
<codebam>	how do i fix 'no space left on device' errors for my /tmp folder
<sheep>	codebam: what are you using /tmp for?
<codebam>	sheep: building a package
<codebam>	specifically the fake-hwclock-git
<tomty89>	 n,/
<tomty89>	oops
<sheep>	codebam: build it in your home directory
<codebam>	fixed... i just removed a bunch of stuff out of tmp as root
<codebam>	npm stuff. so nothing important
<codebam>	and then the pacaur cache
<codebam>	1% used now
<codebam>	:)
<youngwolf>	-c
<tomty89>	codebam: don't abuse your ram
<n00balert>	don't abuse your keyboard?
<reactormonk>	so how can i tell makepkg to install dependencies as root?
<sheep>	add -s
<reactormonk>	ah, ok
<reactormonk>	last time i checked it didn't go for the sudo part. neat.
<sheep>	it will run sudo if it's available
<reactormonk>	yup, now i know
<n00balert>	what's the best way to run a script x mins after the reboot?
<n00balert>	surely there is an easier way than systemd :(
<reactormonk>	sounds like a job for systemd.
<n00balert>	yep
<sheep>	systemd.timer onbootsec
<sheep>	cron probably has a way to do it too
<n00balert>	uh
<n00balert>	cron is not 'boot' aware?
<sheep>	most cron implementations are
<sheep>	using the @reboot option
<n00balert>	my ignorance than
<reactormonk>	there's also onstartupsec relative to systemd startup
<n00balert>	cron should do then...
<n00balert>	i'd rather learn cron than systemd
<sheep>	what do you need to run x mins after reboot?
<n00balert>	vm startups
<n00balert>	over nfs
<reactormonk>	that sounds more like a systemd file with a dependency
<n00balert>	yeah...but i get confused with 'requires, wants, needs, begs, forgives'
<rena>	have the script run at boot and add "sleep 10m" to it?
<sheep>	the timer unit just needs 'unit=whatever.service'
<sheep>	and probably 'wantedby=multi-user.target' in the [install] section
<reactormonk>	and requiresmountsfor=
<n00balert>	...
<n00balert>	i'll try cron...then fallback to systemd
<reactormonk>	n00balert, systemd is the tool you want here.
<sheep>	n00balert: what you're doing sounds like it's dependent on nfs working, so you almost certainly want to do it with systemd
<sheep>	it doesn't sound like it's dependent on how long after boot it runs
<n00balert>	it doesn't but that's my best guess...not the best way i agree
<reactormonk>	and with requiresmountsfor= it shouldn't be harder than a cron script... and you even get the systemctl stop vms systemctl start vms for free
<n00balert>	if this was a client's system...i'd totally do it that way
<n00balert>	or tell people to do it that way...but at home i live in the comfort of cron
<sheep>	i'm not sure about cronie, but i know fcron has a way to do something x amount of time after fcron starts
<n00balert>	hm, that could be bad
<n00balert>	cron crashes too
<n00balert>	thanks guys
<particleman72>	i forgot how to update grub after removing a kernel. anyone want to tell me
<sheep>	particleman72: grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
<particleman72>	thank you :d
<sheep>	particleman72: that was straight from the grub page on the wiki.
<n00balert>	i'm so glad i got rid of grub
<sheep>	n00balert: what do you use now?
<particleman72>	i must have missed it
<n00balert>	refind
<sheep>	n00balert: efistub
<n00balert>	yeah kernels are built that way now
<shadowkatstudios>	where does mysql keep its files?
<shadowkatstudios>	like, .sql files?
<sheep>	shadowkatstudios: it doesn't store .sql files.  it uses a binary backend
<sheep>	shadowkatstudios: i bet it's somewhere under /var/lib
<tekken>	ah
<tekken>	nothing like eggs and chimichangas right before bed
<shadowkatstudios>	i need to get the database back for my prosody install, where would i find that?
<reactormonk>	shadowkatstudios, somewhere under /var/lib? or ask prosody.
<shadowkatstudios>	doing a search using pcmanfm now
<shadowkatstudios>	but i'll check under /var/lib
<tekken>	i use syslinux as my boot manager.
<tekken>	:x
<reactormonk>	running a livecd?
<sheep>	tekken: i do when i have to use bios
<tekken>	reactormonk: no, i just like syslinux.
<tekken>	its simple and gets the job done.
<tekken>	mmm
<n00balert>	i'm beginning to think simple is a relative term too
<tekken>	nice vanilla almond soy to finish my night
<tekken>	s/finish/start/
<tekken>	gotta put together my desktop.
<tekken>	i bet i'm gonna regret getting the fx-6300 processor though.
<tekken>	bet it runs like lava.
<ph0x>	almonds are killing california
<ph0x>	dont buy almond shit
<n00balert>	lul
<tekken>	ph0x: nobody cares about california.
<tekken>	its falling away anyhow.
<tekken>	or some shit.
<particleman72>	finally dumped the lts kernel.. we wil see
<ph0x>	whos water do you think theyll come for next?
<n00balert>	oregon
<tekken>	ph0x: i dunno.... some third world country i don't care about...
<tekken>	n00balert: yea, like oregon
<n00balert>	oregon is a 3rd world country
<tekken>	yep.
<n00balert>	no, not really.
<n00balert>	but they have water
<tekken>	n00balert: as long as they keep producing my almond milk i'm happy.
<tekken>	:)
<n00balert>	lol
<particleman72>	i buy straus milk its yummy.  glass bottle,cream top, smells like clover
<ph0x>	takes 1 gallon of water per day
<ph0x>	to make one almond
<n00balert>	particleman72: i take whatever is organic...tho heavy on pocket
<n00balert>	those gmo almonds and the chemicalized milk
<particleman72>	yeah its a little more expensive but you can tell its just better
<tekken>	ph0x: you'll never get me to believe it takes an entire gallon of water for a single almond per day
<tylerdurden01>	almonds are thoroughly disgusting.
<tekken>	the size to water ratio isn't even correct
<tekken>	:|
<n00balert>	lel
<tylerdurden01>	they taste like cockroaches to me
<tekken>	tylerdurden01: i've ate cockroaches
<tekken>	so no, they don't.
<n00balert>	roasted or fried?
<tekken>	roasted and chocolate covered
<n00balert>	almonds...
<tekken>	never had a fried almond
<particleman72>	i just sprayed around the outside of my house with demon wp dead roaches all over
<tekken>	lol.
<n00balert>	well...i have. but i think my allergies are bullshit
<n00balert>	particleman72: ship them to tekken?
<tekken>	n00balert: they're contaminated and not organic.
<tekken>	no thanks.
<n00balert>	tekken: demon wp is an organic pesticide
<ph0x>	almonds are lquid
<ph0x>	until they are ripe
<ph0x>	believe it or not
<ph0x>	wait is that peacans?
<ph0x>	idk i cant remember
<sheep>	probably pecans
<shanemikel>	can somebody point me to a script that encodes/decodes special characters for urls
<wasamasa>	!give shanemikel g url encoder

<shanemikel>	thanks, i'm an idiot, of course it's built into php and js...
<tekken>	base64_encode?
<tekken>	oh
<tekken>	wrong question
<tekken>	carry on.
<sheep>	urls don't use base64
<tekken>	i'm also busy thinking about whether that bitch of an ex is gonna let me see my son this july.
<particleman72>	tekken i know the feeling i have not seen my kids in 10 years
<particleman72>	last child support payment goes out next month
<tekken>	heh
<tekken>	and with that note.... doing as the handwaving man says
<tekken>	:x
<tekken>	wait...
<tekken>	there's nobody here to help.
<tekken>	:(
<wasamasa>	...
<wasamasa>	then drop it please
<tekken>	wasamasa: why you gotta hate? lol.
<shadowkatstudios>	can i bind ctrl-shift-l to type the lamda symbol?
<wasamasa>	shadowkatstudios: where precisely?
<shadowkatstudios>	in x, ideally, but in ttys would be nice too
<wasamasa>	hack a keyboard layout then
<wasamasa>	i personally wouldn't bother doing it for anything else than my text editor
<wasamasa>	though, i'm using compose for that specific usecase
<shadowkatstudios>	i should really bind my right <correct name for windows key> to compose
<wasamasa>	you can do fun things like <compose><c><c><c><p> -> ☭
<shadowkatstudios>	can you get keyboards with more modifiers than ctrl, shift, alt and whatever windows key is?
<wasamasa>	yeah
<wasamasa>	!give shadowkatstudios g lisp keyboard
<phrik>	shadowkatstudios: space-cadet keyboard - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/space-cadet_keyboard>
<shadowkatstudios>	i know about those, but i highly doubt i could get my hands on one
<wasamasa>	even more amazing, it was hooked up to an ipad!
<shadowkatstudios>	should i just take the plunge, wire up some arduinos and build my own keyboard with like, cherry switches and editor keys and stuff?
<shadowkatstudios>	200 key layout?
<wasamasa>	well, you could go the software route: http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/a-modern-space-cadet/
<phrik>	title: a modern space cadet / steve losh (at stevelosh.com)
<wasamasa>	the neo layout does this kind of thing and got all these fancy layers
<wasamasa>	also, very german
<wasamasa>	shadowkatstudios: they told me they got it in combination with a full lisp machine
<shadowkatstudios>	mmm, that'd make sense.
<shadowkatstudios>	i don't want to think about how much money that would cost.
<wasamasa>	more than your average gaming pc i guess :p
<shadowkatstudios>	more than my $300 budget machine
<arch-tk>	keyboard?
<arch-tk>	build your own
<frankyboy_>	hello :) i have a 4-5 sec keyboard pause between grub and moment i can type password at login screen. basically, i am viewing login screen but keyboard doesn't work for this period of time. any tips how to resolve this issue? :)
<ph0x>	maybe bios taking time to see the usb keyboard
<ph0x>	is it older?
<ph0x>	iv seen older mobos like that
<ph0x>	wait
<ph0x>	misread
<ph0x>	nevermind
<polyzen>	!enter
<phrik>	stop hitting the enter key. can't you even type a full sentence?
<polyzen>	cannot netflix even load?!
<ph0x>	!no
<seylerius>	wasamasa: that approximation of the old space cadet (which i hadn't heard of until today) is awesome.
<polyzen>	fuck
<polyzen>	arch-tk
<polyzen>	fuck
<ph0x>	concentrate on your nextflix instead of my enter-key-frequency
<arch-tk>	yes
<polyzen>	03:42
<gayprogrammer>	systemd provides a tool called systemd-analyze that can be used to show timing details about the boot process

<locrian9>	anyone ever had issues with setting up copy/paste buffers (primary and clipboard) running urvxt over dwm?  i can go into a browser and do cntl+c, then go back to my urxvt terminal and issue shift+insert, and that direction gives me a copy/paste.  however when i'm trying to copy text from my urxvt terminal (cntl+shift+c) and paste that back into a browser (cntl+shift+v), i don't get results.  also plain
<polyzen>	and it does not fucking load
<locrian9>	 old tiled sessions of vim in a single tab don't allow a visual mode select, yank (y), and paste (p) into neighboring tiled window in a common tab.

<phrik>	polyzen: oh no! netflix.com is down. // isitup.org
<polyzen>	seylerius, yessir
<polyzen>	ffffffuuuuuuuuuu
<seylerius>	shiny.
<seylerius>	and distinctly non-shiny about netflix being down.
<sheep>	it's up for me
<arch-tk>	polyzen: and you want me to fix it for you?
<sheep>	and i have comcast
<polyzen>	twss?
<seylerius>	then we can all hate you for it, sheep.
<shadowkatstudios>	so pidgin is freaking out, i use a prosody server with a self-signed cert, and when i import it to pidgin, it still freaks out even though the cert is there >.<
<polyzen>	arch-tk, duh
<sheep>	shadowkatstudios: did you tell it to accept invalid ssl?
<sheep>	or accept that thing
<polyzen>	hax it
<shadowkatstudios>	it's in the certificate window
<seylerius>	arch-tk: everyone knows everything's your responsibility to fix!
<seylerius>	wasamasa: know anything that actually ships with a hyper key?
<polyzen>	i should alias netflix to chrome
<demize>	seylerius: space-cadet keyboard
<seylerius>	demize: do they still ship those bits of classic awesomeness?
<demize>	unlikely i guess.
<seylerius>	didn't think so.
<seylerius>	anything currently shipped you can think of that might come with a hyper key?
<seylerius>	(or perhaps doesn't put the damn windows logo on the super key?)
<demize>	i know of nothing other than the space-cadet and the following symbolics keyboard that's had one.
<seylerius>	alas.
<seylerius>	i'll have to do like the guy in the link and hack layouts and tools to approximate a hyper key.
<tekken>	i setup dokuwiki on my domain
<tekken>	now i just need to fill it with something.
<tekken>	:|
<wasamasa>	seylerius: no
<wasamasa>	seylerius: i just know that some sun keyboards have a separate alt and meta key
<wasamasa>	seylerius: and even a dedicated compose key
<locrian9>	(tekken) congrats on your docuwiki.  we're running a mediawiki with a bluespice front-end.  slightly complicated at the moment, so maybe i'll look more into the dokuwiki.  does the docuwiki have a quick search field?

<tulcod>	is there a way to completely blacklist a program from being used for mime type associations? (gimp in particular)
<tulcod>	system-wide if possible
<sheep>	remove its .desktop file
<sheep>	or just edit the mime type associations to not use gimp
<sheep>	the .desktop file would be reinstalled when gimp upgrades
<tulcod>	so these are both not solutions
<sheep>	why not?
<tulcod>	as you say, the .desktop file gets reinstalled, and i don't want to waste time listing all the individual mime types. cause gimp has plenty.
<sheep>	hmm
<sheep>	there may be a way to do it with sed.  i can't remember where the file is
<tulcod>	i mean i guess i could write a script to edit mime type associations
<tulcod>	but really i just want gimp to gtfo
<sheep>	you could uninstall gimp
<tulcod>	but i use gimp
<tulcod>	just not every freaking time i want to look at a pdf or a jpeg or whatever
<sheep>	you could edit ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list
<tulcod>	well yes, but again, this would be per-mime-type
<tulcod>	and yes, i could write a script to do that, and that's plan b
<sheep>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/default_applications might be useful

<jackies>	printf("hello world!\n");
<shadowkatstudios>	wrong window?
<jackies>	guys, is it safe to leave testing repo uncommented in my daily updates?
<jackies>	nope, that was a different way to say hello world!
<sheep>	jackies: there will sometimes be breaking updates in testing
<jackdaniel>	your edge will bleed ^_^
<jackies>	i expected so, okay another newbie question. what should i do if i want to downgrade my linux kernel, after cleaning my old packages in /var/pacman/cache/db ?
<jackies>	and of course other than trying to recompile it myself
<rkreis_>	jackies, find an old package file somewhere and install it with pacman -u
<rkreis_>	they had something called arch rollback machine if i remember correctly, then it died and then got revived... just check the wiki, it's all ther
<tom^>	!arm
<jackies>	tried, with no hope, everyone is up to date
<phrik>	arch rollback machine. a 3rd party repository for old packages. see https://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-general/2013-september/034094.html
<jackies>	ah let me see that
<namarrgon>	why do you want to downgrade the kernel?
<jackies>	actually in every bit of a kernel update, vmware is having tons of issues, i used to solve each one after each update, but for kernel 4.0.1-1 i didn't find any either on wiki or the internet generally, so i wanted to downgrade to 3.19.6-1 because i need vmware urgently
<namarrgon>	you understand that the problem is vmware, not the kernel?
<jackies>	of course i do, but didn't find any fix for it until now, and my work is based mainly on vmware, so i can't postpone it anymore
<jackdaniel>	jackies: linux-3.19.3-3 will be ok?
<jackies>	jackdaniel, yea, vmware was working fine on that version until 4.0.1-1 appeared
<namarrgon>	what isn't working now?
<arch-tk>	jackies: is it because you failed to reboot after a kernel update and didn't know that the modules version directory gets deleted during an update and modloading old modules gives errors?
<jackies>	that arm is amazing, found an image of it, thanks a lot guys
<jackdaniel>	jackies: check priv for link - it would be careless tough to intall it from random link ;p
<jackdaniel>	oh, ok
<jackdaniel>	nvm :p
<guest62523>	holy sheet
<guest62523>	over 2000 people in here
<jackdaniel>	nowai!
<jackies>	arch-tk, nope, i'm doing a reboot ofc after each system update generally, and specifically after kernel's ones
<mrelendig>	welcome to 2003
<mrelendig>	guest62523: fix your nick
<arch-tk>	mrelendig: don't worry, he must be one of the elder guests.
<arch-tk>	they are the masters of the scrolls.
<tom^>	this is the realms of skyrim?
<earnestly>	arch-tk: did you get that ups?
<arch-tk>	earnestly: sadly, no. it got cancelled.
<arch-tk>	as in, amazon or they cancelled.
<earnestly>	that's not altogether very unsurprising
<arch-tk>	apparently shops reserve the right to do something stupid.
<tom^>	huh?
<arch-tk>	like fuck up their prices.
<tom^>	price was unbeliveable low?
<tom^>	:p
<arch-tk>	tom^: unbelievably low?
<arch-tk>	it was 98% off
<tom^>	haha
<arch-tk>	for a £700 item
<mrelendig>	all serious online shops have a clausule about "errors" or "wrong price" or similar
<shadowkatstudios>	arch-tk, so like, $14?
<shadowkatstudios>	pound, rather.
<arch-tk>	shadowkatstudios: what the fuck is that weird s with a line through it?
<tom^>	arch-tk: swedish crowns.
<shadowkatstudios>	arch-tk, it's what american keyboards have instead of a £, we really need a generic currency symbol
<arch-tk>	like `fuck'
<arch-tk>	that's a good generic currency symbol
<arch-tk>	i'll pay you 100 fucks
<shadowkatstudios>	100? that'll take quite some time to pay off.
<tom^>	shadowkatstudios: he is fast.
<tom^>	sigh the kernel is really starting to contain to many drivers.
<demize>	shadowkatstudios: there is one.
<tomty89>	isn't that linus' goal
<sheep>	you can configure it not to compile unneeded drivers
<demize>	shadowkatstudios: ¤
<tom^>	sheep: the trick is to know what you need.
<cloudef>	inb4 userspace drivers
<shadowkatstudios>	demize, what is it? what's it called?
<sheep>	inb4 moving drivers to a separate package
<shadowkatstudios>	is it a prefix or a suffix?
<demize>	it's a currency sign an it's called currency sign,
<shadowkatstudios>	that makes sense.
<du5tball>	can i mount the same /boot for several oses? (in this case, arch and ubuntu. some games seem to need ubuntu >_> or the devs won't help you if it's not ubuntu)
<mrelendig>	du5tball: with some care yes
<mrelendig>	also what games?
<mrelendig>	you could just use a container instead of running ubuntu...
<tom^>	du5tball: you can get most if not all games running here.
<du5tball>	tom^: true, but metro crashes randomly and the support only supports, if you use ubuntu
<du5tball>	mrelendig: container? as in, lxc?
<tom^>	du5tball: just tell them you run ubuntu then, even if you dont.
<tomty89>	tom^: good one
<mrelendig>	metro games works fine for me
<earnestly>	http://www.elsman.com/mlkit/ converts most programs (ml) to almost stack based memory management instead of gc using region analysis.  basically since the 80s

<du5tball>	tom^: they want a system log from some ubuntu-tool. it shows up and i don't have the nerves to fiddle around with all the logs just to make my machine look like ubuntu
<tom^>	i would :p
<tomty89>	du5tball: what nerves do you need? just a copy and a editor
<mrelendig>	if they refuse to help then demand your money back

<du5tball>	bah
<du5tball>	sue everyone!
<du5tball>	here's another thing. i've got a 1 tb drive which is almost full, but i want to convert the whole drive to lvm (from ext4). any way to do that in place reliably?
<tomty89>	wat
<mrelendig>	!give du5tball yt google btrfs 2015
<phrik>	du5tball: why you should consider using btrfs ... like google does. - youtube: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dplcprqjva>
<du5tball>	mrelendig: does it still have the limitation of root not being able to reside in a subvol?
<mrelendig>	du5tball: not since 5 years ago
<du5tball>	wth... i missed out on stuff.
<mrelendig>	anyway, way to convert to lvm
<mrelendig>	backup and restore
<mrelendig>	!common-sense
<phrik>	http://arch.har-ikkje.net/gfx/common-sense.jpg
<mattoufoutu>	tomty89, ok, i tried to install the ath10k firmware from git anyway (and created a hw2.1 folder linked to the hw3.0 one), but as you said, something still seems to be missing, as now i get errors in dmesg about a missing cal-pci-0000:04:00.0.bin
<du5tball>	screw that. i just didn't consider btrfs because i thought the limitation was still in place
<mattoufoutu>	i've attached the new dmesg output, and the pkgbuild i used to install the firmware files to the initial gist (https://gist.github.com/mattoufoutu/40f387b5bfc5dcf48812)

<tomty89>	mattoufoutu: did you read the link i sent you later?

<shadowkatstudios>	what filesystem do i want to use for a 4gb flash drive (as an os drive)?
<keenerd>	ext4 works fine, just take care to minimize writes.
<tomty89>	^has_journal
<shadowkatstudios>	i'm thinking i'll go with btrfs and the ssd/noatime options
<keenerd>	tomty89: doesn't matter, still more efficient (less writes) than ext3 without a journal.
<mrelendig>	noatime isn't that usefull
<tom^>	keenerd: i wonder if thats the case since it runs on the same driver? :p
<shadowkatstudios>	and if i go for btrfs, i can easily expand if i write the image to an 8gb usb if i want to
<mrelendig>	shadowkatstudios: f2fs
<tomty89>	keenerd: i mean to disable journaling
<mrelendig>	disabeling the journal is stupid
<mrelendig>	either do real only image, eg using squashfs, or use f2fs
<mrelendig>	read*
<mattoufoutu>	tomty89, i'm gonna have a look, not sure i'll understand much, first time i'm struggling with that kind of stuff, but at least it will be educative ^^
<mrelendig>	vfat as / is utter insanity
<tomty89>	mrelendig: you only live once
<keenerd>	i used ext4 on cheap flash drive for / for years.
<keenerd>	works great.
<mrelendig>	keenerd: plain luck
<mrelendig>	usb sticks are horrible
<shadowkatstudios>	well, i'm going to be using this to play quake, so i doubt there'll be much writing to it
<keenerd>	mrelendig: they are fine.  1ms minimum access time is the only bad part.
<mrelendig>	!give keenerd ccc sd card

<mrelendig>	most usb sticks are of the same quality
<shadowkatstudios>	(literally just gonna use this usb as a bootable copy of openarena)
<mrelendig>	cheapest crappiest nand chips they could get that week on the shinsen market or ebay
<mrelendig>	usually
<mrelendig>	f2fs helps a bit due to cow
<keenerd>	mrelendig: i always used the cheapest stuff i could find.
<tomty89>	i wonder how much better is f2fs than nilfs2
<shadowkatstudios>	also, will copying a .vmdk to a raw to a dd of=/dev/<usb> work for a bootable usb?
<mrelendig>	cheapest up front is often not the cheapest when it comes to total cost :)
<keenerd>	if you minimize writes then the fs doesn't matter much.
<tomty89>	shadowkatstudios: unlikely
<shadowkatstudios>	so i can't install it to a vm?
<mrelendig>	depends on the boot loader etc
<shadowkatstudios>	then write the disk to the usb?
<tomty89>	shadowkatstudios: wait you mean you convert it first?
<keenerd>	mrelendig: well, here it was.  i never had a single failure on cheap generic flash.
<shadowkatstudios>	yeah, using converttoraw
<tomty89>	ugh use qemu
<keenerd>	mrelendig: only failure was with a name brand card, and that happened the moment it was plugged in (smoke).
<tomty89>	you can even use the device directly
<shadowkatstudios>	alternatively, i could use the p4 ht 64 box on my floor
<keenerd>	shadowkatstudios: you could light a $100 bill on fire every year.  cell phones are more powerful and don't guzzle watts.
<shadowkatstudios>	i meant to install to the usb
<mrelendig>	why not just install to the usb the normal way
<shadowkatstudios>	'cause i don't feel like going under my desk and plugging it in
<shadowkatstudios>	so i'm going to use a vm running on the machine on my desk
<tomty89>	shadowkatstudios: why not the bootstrap
<tomty89>	or just pacstrap
<tomty89>	!wtf pacstrap

<produnis>	hi there... i have a question:  i installed the tbs-dvb-drivers from aur, und my tv-card works fine with them. however, with every new kernel-update, i need to re-built the driver-package... i am searching for a quasi "dkms"-workaround:  how can i automatically bulit the driver-package afeter any linux-kernel-update?
<mrelendig>	why not just use dkms?
<produnis>	mrelendig, i thought i would need a package that ends with "-dkms"
<mrelendig>	you just have to write a profile
<mrelendig>	profile/config
<produnis>	mrelendig, i dont know how...
<mrelendig>	there are lots of documentation for dkms on the intertubes
<mrelendig>	and you can look at the configs for other modules as examples
<produnis>	i dont know where it is located
<chrysalis>	i never really played with dkms too, but doesnt kernel 4 kinda depricate dkms now?
<mrelendig>	produnis: as i said, the intertubes has info
<mrelendig>	like......  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/dynamic_kernel_module_support
<tomty89>	what does the kernel have to do with it
<phrik>	title: dynamic kernel module support - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<mrelendig>	chrysalis: not at all
<tomty89>	how can something being served deprecate whatever serves it
<produnis>	anyone else interested in helping a noob?
<namarrgon>	you'll have to do some research yourself
<d_garbage>	not to put you off learning something new but isn't rebuilding a driver manually a very small amount of effort on kernel update?
<mrelendig>	produnis: start by reading that wiki page
<tomty89>	eww i nearly forgot dkms is something from dell
<namarrgon>	especially the link at the bottom of the page
<gayprogrammer>	produnis: knowing what you don't know was the hardest part. now you find out how to learn it.

<yeowang>	i've been trying to search for the fstobdf binary in packages, but i can't seem to find the package containing it. the most helpful thing i've got so far is that the package in debian is called x11-xfs-utils. does this exist on arch?
<tomty89>	wat even efibootmgr is from dell
<produnis>	some people might need more than a textbook to learn how it works...
<tomty89>	produnis: why don't you just rtfm and ask when you see something you don't understand
<tomty89>	"i need help...i don't know what help i need..." wouldn't work anywhere
<d_garbage>	produnis, true but what you do is start with the book first and then ask for input as you run into problems
<tomty89>	ah debian packaging debian/efibootmgr.git
<tomty89>	eh wait...historical efibootmgr.git	now hosted at https://github.com/vathpela/efibootmgr
<phrik>	title: rhinstaller/efibootmgr · github (at github.com)
<produnis>	the problem is: english is not my native language, and i have a hard time while rtfm
<braindamage>	d_garbage: while it's not so much efforts recompiling, it's annoying because it can be automated easily and if you forget then you get malfunctions
<braindamage>	there's rather no reason not to use it
<produnis>	never mind
<braindamage>	( ps, your line of reasoning could be extended to pretty much most tasks which are automated, and is, imho, flawed )
<earnestly>	braindamage: i think the reason is to do things manually first to understand the process
<braindamage>	i have no problems with that, i reccomend it myself, but for prolonged usage? no
<d_garbage>	of course there is always that calculation of the effort to automate vs time/effort saved
<d_garbage>	in this case sounds quite high, learning payoff excepted
<braindamage>	you need to quantify the time wasted in debugging when you forget about it, it's not very obvious
<d_garbage>	i think i might be slightly biased because i build the kernel, so the extra effort might seem less to me

<qgel>	hi, i just installed arch on a new asus ux303 with two graphics cards (intel 5500hd, nvidia 840m). x (and kde) work fine. however, if i switch to a tty after starting x i get weird tearing / text is rendered at multiple places at once, like the resolution is wrong or something like that.
<qgel>	anyone got an idea what the problem might be? the wiki article about the ux303 describes no such problem.
<tomty89>	probably i915 is still shitty on intel 5000
<tomty89>	though it'll remain constantly shitty, but it still gets better later
<tomty89>	followed by unexpected ups and downs
<qgel>	hmm so there is no workaround i could use? because everything looks fine on the ttys if i dont have x running at the same time
<jackdaniel>	/win 13
<drizzd>	pkgbuild: in the absence of make install, what's the recommended way to recursively copy the build result from "$srcdir/builddir" to "$pkgdir/..."? cp -rt "$srcdir/builddir" "$pkgdir/...", followed by chmod -r?
<tomty89>	qgel: no idea. have you set something with an xorg conf?
<chrysalis>	my old laptop had a problem like that, couldnt go back to tty after i started x... never really 'got better' for 5 years+
<tomty89>	drizzd: mv!
<drizzd>	and then chmod?
<tomty89>	it depends *shrug*
<drizzd>	they should be owned by root, right? that's why package runs in a fakeroot environment.
<qgel>	tomty89 i have not changed in the xorg configuration.
<tomty89>	qgel: than even less chance you can find a workaround
<tomty89>	flood their bugzilla. intel devs are freakin' lazy anyway
<qgel>	:/. im just reading about the i915 in the wiki. maybe i need to add i915 to my modules for kms?
<tomty89>	that's unlikely relevant. but you may try
<tomty89>	drizzd: you can ls -l your srcdir :p
<augustas>	cou
<chrysalis>	qgel, why you wanna be in a tty anyway?
<augustas>	maybe i installed grub in wrong section, because not working'
<tomty89>	qgel: i don't assume you set something like nomodeset right?
<arch-tk>	chrysalis: in case x goes to shit?
<arch-tk>	chrysalis: in case you're doing something you can do only in a tty?
<arch-tk>	chrysalis: in case you want a backup plan
<chrysalis>	arch-tk, yea like what?
<augustas>	error: no such device
<qgel>	tomty89 no
<arch-tk>	chrysalis: fucking around with the framebuffer for one
<chrysalis>	ive lived with no tty cause of similar bug and i dont miss it one bit, infact i forgot about it until reminded now
<chrysalis>	arch-tk, list one thing you can do in tty only? lol
<tomty89>	augustas: better tell your partition layout and how you installed grub
<arch-tk>	chrysalis: i just did.
<qgel>	chrysalis i dont need the tty much, but every now and then ill get to the point where my window manager becomes unresponsive. so id like a backup.
<tomty89>	augustas: also did you see grub shell or the menu
<arch-tk>	chrysalis: if you try writing to /dev/fb0 within x you get a mess.
<qgel>	also, staying in the tty to long at the moment also seems to screw up all rendering, on x as well.
<augustas>	from install section in wiki. no just booting... grub loading. welcome to grub and then error no such device entering rescure mode ( sorry not writing in paste.org or something
<d_garbage>	drizzd, i think that's what 'install' is for? no expert though
<arch-tk>	chrysalis: showkey --scancodes
<tomty89>	augustas: probably you forgot to deal with grub.cfg
<chrysalis>	arch-tk, great, youll need the tty once a year, disable your dm and boot to tty
<arch-tk>	chrysalis: that's two
<arch-tk>	chrysalis: dm?
<tomty89>	augustas: it's not helpful to say "i did what the wiki told" btw :p
<arch-tk>	who needs a dm?
<arch-tk>	chrysalis: also, why should i need to reboot to do something in linux.
<augustas>	somehow i can run live usb, login as root and try to reconfig grub? and i doesnt run fstab, there was problem with that
<chrysalis>	arch-tk, if you were paying attention you would know that tty bug is only when going from x to tty, not initial boot
<chrysalis>	arch-tk, anyway, forget it, ive no time to reason with you
<arch-tk>	chrysalis: i was paying attention you twit.
<arch-tk>	chrysalis: that's why i said such a bug would be a pain in the ass for someone who has reasons to use a tty
<d_garbage>	you're both getting personal now, which rarely helps
<sheep>	ass and ttys
<d_garbage>	!grab sheep
<phrik>	d_garbage: tada!
<earnestly>	tty devices are scary things to program for
<arch-tk>	sheep: would have sounded better if you said as and ttys
<qgel>	could i somehow force the nvidia driver to render ttys instead of the intel ones?
<earnestly>	which is why kernel devs were happy for it to be replaced with kmscon or something else
<d_garbage>	doesn't tty come from the old days of teleprinters and so on?
<earnestly>	!tty
<phrik>	the tty demystified: http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/index.php
<earnestly>	the trouble isn't what it is, it's how it's implemented
<earnestly>	lots and lots of legacy
<d_garbage>	hah that's it
<d_garbage>	used to look fancy in old films
<arch-tk>	chrysalis: and anyway, here's the last thing i'll say, if anyone was fucking around with the fb, or using showkeys --scancodes they would be doing so with the aim to do most of the work in a graphical environment with terminal emulators, web browsers etc. so it honestly doesn't make sense to make an exception in turning off your dm and rebooting just to do something you're going to spend 5 seconds doing
<arch-tk>	before you get back into a graphical environment.
<d_garbage>	like thrillers and action movies
<d_garbage>	it's why in modern films they still put that little sound on when printing characters to the screen lol
<d_garbage>	i think there's an article on tvtropes about that kind of thing
<chrysalis>	grat, beat up yur head against it then to figure out there no fixing instead of rebooting for 20sec
<d_garbage>	qgel, you might not want to, nvidia has its own problems with tty's
<earnestly>	nvidia flat out doesn't support it
<pirithous>	nshittia
<teraflop>	no kms no fun
<qgel>	alright, i guess it might not be worth the trouble
<augustas>	who can agree that this is good tut? http://www.linuxveda.com/2015/04/20/arch-linux-tutorial-manual i know all of you can say that better follow wiki but just asking
<phrik>	title: how to install arch linux - easiest guide ever! (at www.linuxveda.com)
<augustas>	step by step like in wiki
<tom^>	its horrible
<tom^>	because it isnt the wiki..
<teraflop>	heh
<thrice>	awful
<arch-tk>	chrysalis: rebooting takes 20 seconds for people with ssds, not for people without, in fact, even 20 seconds is a giant pisstake when you spend a few minutes programming to have to spend 40 seconds rebooting and 5 seconds testing.
<thrice>	what is the hip icon theme to use these days?  i'm tired of numix
<arch-tk>	chrysalis: that's absolutely unacceptable.
<arch-tk>	there are times when fixing something is not worth it but this is definitely not one of those times.
<qgel>	any tips what i could do if, for example, i need to kill a gui app which captures all input? steam does this for me sometimes...
<d_garbage>	oxygen }:]
<tom^>	thrice: uh icons? :s
<chrysalis>	arch-tk, are we booting arch in a tty or ubuntu in gnome?
<arch-tk>	chrysalis: what?
<beest>	tom^: i think it's for catholics or something
<d_garbage>	qgel, blind type :p
<tom^>	beest: must be
<namarrgon>	augustas: if a tutorial tells you to add the [archlinuxfr] repo and to run -sy then you shouldn't trust it
<qgel>	d_garbage, sadly, spending to much time in the tty completelety screws up rendering and x wont work afterwards as well :/
<d_garbage>	ouch
<earnestly>	augustas: it's a bad piece of work, they almost always are
<earnestly>	it over complicates things as well for no real reason
<d_garbage>	qgel, i gess you might as well just kill x then, if steam misbehaves
<chrysalis>	qgel, was the iso fine when you were intalling arch?
<d_garbage>	guess*
<earnestly>	switch to another tty and kill stream from there?
<ksj>	how do i stop systemd from managing my network? i'm trying to manually disconnect from a network with iw, which works for a second, and then bam, systemd has reconnected me
<earnestly>	ksj: don't use systemd-networkd
<sheep>	systemctl disable whatever
<earnestly>	ksj: i doubt systemd actually has anything to with it
<ksj>	i never enabled it
<earnestly>	especially if you're using `iw`
<thrice>	it's off by default
<ksj>	and it's a target, not a service
<thrice>	no
<earnestly>	what the fuck are you doing?
<thrice>	there is a systemd-networkd
<ksj>	it can only be systemd. i disabled netctl
<earnestly>	sigh.
<ksj>	and i don't have connman or wicd installed
<earnestly>	amazing deductive skills there.  perhaps you'd be better off checking if stuff like wpa_supplicant is running or a dhcp client
<thrice>	why do you think systemd is reconnecting you?
<wyre>	there is any channel about aur here? in freenode? :p
<ksj>	because when looking through systemctl i can see network-online.target and network.target
<wyre>	i'm having issues with a pkgbuild :)
<sheep>	wyre: this is the preferred place
<earnestly>	the only way "systemd" could be doing this is if systemd-networkd is enabled and configured to use dhcp, with wpa_supplicant running (since i assume wireless given your use of iw)
<tigrmesh>	wyre, this is it.  what is the problem?
<sheep>	wyre: correction: #archlinux-aur
<earnestly>	ksj: those are just targets, it doesn't reconnect shit
<sheep>	but you can ask here and that channel is really small
<wyre>	ok :d
<wyre>	thanks sheep :d
<augustas>	earnestly yes, you always giving good advices.
<ksj>	earnestly: ok, thanks. wpa_supplicant is running for some reason
<earnestly>	ksj: it's not "for some reason", netctl starts it.
<earnestly>	even if you stop netctl
<ksj>	i disabled netctl
<earnestly>	yeah, netctl doesn't really... uh, smart
<qgel>	chrysalis i must admit i diddn't check
<ksj>	wait....so if i disable netctl, it doesn't really disable it?
<earnestly>	ksj: it sort of does
<ksj>	shit....that made me chuckle
<earnestly>	but seems to leave behind a bunch of processes
<sheep>	wyre: you might just want to ask her
<sheep>	e
<wyre>	;)
<earnestly>	i assume you're familiar with what wpa_supplicant is and what it does and how wireless over encrypted channels works
<ksj>	ok, going to reboot and kill everything. i guess it's my only option to make sure i'm starting clean with iw
<earnestly>	and how it has nothing much to do with systemd
<earnestly>	why?
<sheep>	it can also handle wired 802.1x
<ksj>	i wasn't bitching about systemd
<ksj>	just that i couldn't see it could be anything else
<earnestly>	ksj: even using `iw` doesn't make sense
<earnestly>	what are you actually trying to do here?
<ksj>	and i don't know systemd well enough to troubleshoot it
<earnestly>	ksj: systemd wasn't even remotely the right place to look
<ksj>	i'm trying to get control and understanding of how to connect to a wireless network
<earnestly>	so you wouldn't be doing any troubleshooting there
<ksj>	i can use wicd and connman, and they work some of the time
<earnestly>	!give ksj wpa_cli
<phrik>	ksj: https://gist.github.com/buhman/7162560
<earnestly>	!give ksj wpa_supplicant
<ksj>	but i want to actually learn how to do it properly
<phrik>	ksj: https://gist.github.com/holomorph/9655261
<ksj>	wap_cli??? the wiki doesn't mention that
<earnestly>	ksj: wicd is dead, use connman or networkmanager if you want a full manager
<ksj>	thanks
<earnestly>	ksj: fuck the wiki on this topic
<earnestly>	it's crap
<ksj>	yeah, connamn is a lot better
<chrysalis>	ksj, look for a leftover network config from the install in your /etc/systemd/
<earnestly>	chrysalis: wat?
<earnestly>	why would ther... does netctl do that?
<chrysalis>	i think os
<chrysalis>	so
<earnestly>	chrysalis: nope
<chrysalis>	something does
<earnestly>	likely netctl.  networkmanager will likely switch to networkd as an alternative to dhclient
<earnestly>	but /etc/systemd is for admin override, no packages should install anything there
<earnestly>	systemd comes with some something networkd related units in /usr/lib/systemd/network
<chrysalis>	i thought it was a fresh install, sorry
<augustas>	earnestly in how much time do you install arch linux? 10 minutes? :d
<earnestly>	augustas: without waiting for downloads?
<augustas>	yes, only commands
<earnestly>	probably a minute or so, i haven't done it for a long time
<pessimist>	you can easily make a script that does everything for you
<pessimist>	after you get familiar with the system
<pessimist>	automate everything! :)
<thrice>	mkfs.xfs && mount && pacstrap && chroot
<nizumzen>	augustas: installing arch linux is pretty easy when you get the hang of it - the only thing that took me ages last time was because i was moving from a bios system to a uefi system and i had to teach myself about uefi bootloaders and gpt etc
<utack>	wonder when gcc5 will leave testing and how much it will break...
<beest>	considering the kernel's already being built with it i'd say not much
<beest>	arch's shipping kernel, that is
<polyzen>	someone should fix the netflix issue, now
<polyzen>	haven't been able to connect since last night...
<drathir>	polyzen: thats only 1 day...
<polyzen>	this is like not being able to access my email for a day
<polyzen>	but worse
<beest>	polyzen: you mean /your/ netflix issue, wfm
<polyzen>	that is hwat i mean
<polyzen>	though:
<polyzen>	!isitup netflix.com
<phrik>	polyzen: oh no! netflix.com is down. // isitup.org
<beest>	yeah no, i'm currently watching planet earth on it in an adjacent window.
<polyzen>	idontbelieveyou.gif
<polyzen>	this is bs
<scimmia>	i've got it up, to
<scimmia>	s/to/too
<oarmstrong>	up here in the uk
<woodennails>	hey guys, whats best way to parition arch when installing, i have a 128gb ssd and a 500gb hdd
<bougyman>	!best
<phrik>	use whatever suits _you_ best.
<d_garbage>	i'd say using a partitioner is the best way
<bougyman>	we don't know what you want to do with that thing, woodennails.
<d_garbage>	you could try magnets
<bougyman>	personally, i like a small /boot then i put everything else on lvm
<woodennails>	basically, kinda want to run the os and a few apps from the ssd and have any pictures/movies etc on the hdd
<xkonni>	d_garbage: but they dont work on the ssd... ;(
<teraflop>	woodennails: i do / and bind some non . dirs to the hdd
<d_garbage>	nonsense magnets work on everything
<bougyman>	i tried btrfs instead of lvm and regretted it. btrfs isn't completely ready yet.
<d_garbage>	i don't think you understand magnets at all
<beest>	polyzen: https://clbin.com/jk8dwe.png
<drathir>	woodennails: os+swap at sdd and /home at second...
<drathir>	woodennails: also maybe consider usage of lvm...
<teraflop>	or btrfs with subvols
<drathir>	bougyman: hardcore you to chose btrfs...
<teraflop>	why /home at the hdd?
<beest>	polyzen: if you can't connect to netflix at all (and if phrik can't either) then there are probably routing issues upstream
<polyzen>	can't even connect via proxy
<d_garbage>	so when phrik's not answering questions it's watching netflix?
<qgel>	chrysalis huh, going to sleep, waking up and immediately switching to tty seems to be a workaround. not pretty, but i guess ill take whatever works :d
<drathir>	teraflop: no needed fast access to /home mostly... or also possible place /home na sdd and /home/user/storage at hdd
<d_garbage>	yup, often the way in life
<polyzen>	put home on the ssd
<teraflop>	yeah
<polyzen>	and var
<polyzen>	!give beest fuuu
<d_garbage>	qgel, if you run the witcher 1 in wine, you often need to switch to a tty and back a few dozen times to get the models to load properly. :p
<polyzen>	!fu
<phrik>	fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu--------
<beest>	:d
<beest>	if you wanna see something i'll watch it and tell you what's going on
<teraflop>	xd
<linnak>	please guys . have you ever seen a good installation manual all in one. but please don't give me the archwiki link
<beest>	linnak: the arch wiki is the best you'll do
<chrysalis>	linnak, whats wrong with it?
<linnak>	not for me. too many links from other pages
<du5tball>	assuming i log in via sddm to openbox, where exactly do i have to set environment variables like xdg dirs? (i know they should be default. nonetheless, some programs seem to need the additional env-var to honor them)
<chrysalis>	linnak, whoever that install is for he needs to know how to use it afterwords, so going though the install is kinda mandatory
<d_garbage>	linnak, if you find following links on the internet hard, probably might as well not bother installing arch
<beest>	you'll probably be following even more once you have it installed anyway
<utack>	beest how do i find out which gcc version was used for the kernel?
<beest>	cat /proc/version
<utack>	thx
<smilex>	i'm trying to install seabios with pacman, but it seems to be sparsely available in the mirrors, and from the one i get it from, it fails the integrity check. is there any way for me to fix this?
<polyzen>	beest, open a port forward for me so i can use netflix over your internets
<polyzen>	v.v
<polyzen>	port forward/tunnel :p
<beest>	smilex: best i can tell you is to get better mirrors, i just installed it in about a half second
<achillion>	polyzen: get a us vps?
<smilex>	beest: where can i change that?
<polyzen>	achillion, tried proxying through erebor as well
<smilex>	been awhile since i used the manual
<beest>	!give smilex wiki mirrors
<phrik>	smilex: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/mirrors
<achillion>	polyzen: i managed to watch netflix from cyprus to netflix.uk via my uk vps using openvpn. it was smooth.
<beest>	polyzen: where are you anyway, i've forgotten
<achillion>	though, uk netflix is very poor compared to us.
<d_garbage>	du5tball, http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/software/xdg-user-dirs/
<phrik>	title: xdg-user-dirs (at www.freedesktop.org)
<d_garbage>	however i think xdg is a bit ropey anyway and things still might not work as you expect
<smilex>	beest: thanks
<teraflop>	i do netflix through a vpn in jacksonville
<beest>	i guess jacksonville's good for something after all
<teraflop>	heh sure
<polyzen>	beest, ny
<polyzen>	achillion, fffuuuuu
<teraflop>	s/vpn/vps
<du5tball>	d_garbage: thanks
<achillion>	polyzen: hm?
<achillion>	polyzen: why the fu
<teraflop>	achillion: he's upset he cant watch daredevil
<achillion>	ah
<beest>	smilex: also if it's "sparsely available" you probably need an -syu since it just had an update yesterday
<polyzen>	teraflop, scrotal recall is pretty fun/ny
<a-109-107>	if i don't see my macbook
<beest>	tell it you love it?
<a-109-107>	if i don't see my macbook's media keys keycodes in xev, what am i missing?
<utack>	beest do you know if the entire buildserver uses gcc5 now or just the kernel?
<scimmia>	utack, the build server would be no different than any other machine. testing has gcc 5.1, extra has gcc 4.9
<utack>	so the linux kernel being built with gcc 5.1 is an exception scimmia because core would still be gcc4.9?
<scimmia>	utack, no, it was built against testing then moved to core
<utack>	interesting
<scimmia>	there is no core-<arch>-build script because everything in core goes through testing
<shadowkatstudios>	a usb flash drive should be 4096mib, right?
<teraflop>	polyzen: i liked unbreakable kimmy schmidt
<polyzen>	\o/
<oarmstrong>	shadowkatstudios: if it's a 4gib drive, then yes?
<shadowkatstudios>	yeah, that's what i meant (oops)
<particleman72>	anyone having issues with konversation hogging cpu. at times its using 100% of one core
<bushido_>	particleman72: what you mean overload?
<du5tball>	here's a seemingly dumb question: when building a bunch of packages via pacaur, how can i disable the pgp-checks? i know it works on makepkg with --skippgpcheck.
<d_garbage>	particleman72, this the new kf5 version?
<d_garbage>	du5tball, why would you do either of those things?
<d_garbage>	or any of those three things indeed
<du5tball>	i'm just setting up the system again as i f*ed up big somewhere, but saved my package lists. i verified them all at some point, so i know they're valid. and right now, i'm too lazy to re-verify every single one again
<spyhawk>	du5tball: you can't
<particleman72>	d_garbage  yes it is
<d_garbage>	why use a list of what you had before? maybe you don't need all that stuff anymore
<spyhawk>	du5tball: either use cower and do the manual makepkg dance, or fix the pgp issues.
<d_garbage>	the less unsupported packages the better, now would be a great chance to reduce them
<du5tball>	i went throught the whole list before feeding it to pacaur :)
<d_garbage>	auto-retrieve the keys then?
<du5tball>	how would i do that?
<spyhawk>	du5tball: check makepkg wiki page
<d_garbage>	did you make any effort to find out before asking that?
<du5tball>	yup
<d_garbage>	no
<d_garbage>	lies
<particleman72>	lol
<spyhawk>	well, try again then
<d_garbage>	there's a setting in gpg.conf, now go look that up
<beest>	there's also a factoid for it that i've forgotten
<d_garbage>	we need a factoid to remind us about the factoid, clearly
<beest>	!nokeys
<phrik>	add 'keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve' to ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf, to let makepkg download missing keys automatically.
<beest>	that should probably be "uncomment" instead
<beest>	since it's commented in the shipped conf
<amcrae>	note the path...
<beest>	oh.
<du5tball>	nah beest is right. the full config gets copied there
<beest>	no, alan's right
<amcrae>	since when
<beest>	allan, too
<du5tball>	idk. but it was just sitting there.
<amcrae>	> cat ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
<amcrae>	keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu
<amcrae>	doubt that is the full config :p
<du5tball>	on my end, it's the complete thing. and i'm just reinstalling
<beest>	no, the factoid suggests adding it to your user confing which is the smarter thing
<beest>	i also suggest more drugs for myself since i obviously can't fucking type this morning
<beest>	oh wait, it does get copied there
<d_garbage>	it gets created
<amcrae>	since when
<d_garbage>	i dunno but it does
<amcrae>	that is stupid behaviour...
<thrice>	hm, i can't get termite fonts to look nice outside of gnome.  gnome does some serious magic
<beest>	termite fonts?
<amcrae>	then there is no point having a global config - one it is copied, the global one is useless
<thrice>	fonts displayed without the termite emulator, if you want to be so pedantic
<beest>	i guess it's meant to seed configs for new users? silly
<earnestly>	interesting, i have the full config
<earnestly>	i don't recall copying it over (history doesn't suggest it, but idk)
<beest>	i surely didn't on this box
<d_garbage>	i'm not sure now actually, i might have been thinking of the keyring
<beest>	ohhhh there's a skel now.
<beest>	or supposedly according to the wiki, that's not on my box
<beest>	oh there it is
<thrice>	here's how termite looks in xfce:  http://a.pomf.se/rurkxq.png
<thrice>	and an old ss i have from gnome:  http://a.pomf.se/dtgxap.png
<thrice>	same font, same termite config
<earnestly>	different dpi
<thrice>	hm
<earnestly>	thrice: consider, run xrandr --dpi 72, then open a terminal.  try --dpi 144, then --dpi 96 (a good constant)
<thrice>	xfce is using 96
<mueslo>	the kde4/5 transition is messing up the print system for me
<earnestly>	thrice: that value isn't really reliably
<earnestly>	reliable*
<earnestly>	unfortunately
<thrice>	i'm too lazy to see what gnome does
<d_garbage>	beest, not here either. now i have no idea where the conf came from hah! great security, eh? :p
<earnestly>	or it is
<earnestly>	okay nvm
<beest>	lol i'm glad everyone's as confused as i
<earnestly>	thrice: dpi is a real problem that most des and such just ignore
<thrice>	earnestly: so, what's the best way to handle it?  i can disable the dpi setting in xfce.  a combo of that + a fontconfig/fonts.conf ?
<earnestly>	beest: the skel matches my gpg.conf almost exactly
<thrice>	i assumed it was xfce settings (some gtk2 stuff) not getting along with gtk3 vte3
<earnestly>	thrice: the current best way to handle it is to set the dpi to 96 and deal with anything
<earnestly>	or a multiple of 96 (or 48)
<amadiro>	earnestly, from what i've heard, both kde and gnome are working on dpi issues, but some of the fundamentals (gtk, qt) still have issues...
<earnestly>	  (96%2)*!10
<earnestly>	0 48 96 144 192 240 288 336 384 432
<amadiro>	i think the gnome team had a blog post about it recently
<earnestly>	amadiro: it's not really a solvable issue, np hard :p
<beest>	heh
<amadiro>	earnestly, what do you mean?
<thrice>	earnestly: but, how can i make termite look as sharp as gnome?
<earnestly>	amadiro: it's like trying to sample music well below nyquist and expecting to get an accurate result
<d_garbage>	beest, ah, it's not in /etc/skel it's in /usr/share/gnupg/gpg-conf.skel
<earnestly>	amadiro: the only solution to this problem is to use monitors with extremely high pixel density and have all monitors attached be the same dpi
<beest>	yup, it's just a skeleton for gpg, doesn't get created for new users, only on gpg first-run
<earnestly>	otherwise you have to just scale shit, but font sizes (or typeface sizes specifically) are not linear
<amadiro>	earnestly, not sure what you are referring to, all that should be necessary is to teach the respective toolkits and rendering backends (qt, gtk+, qpainter, gdk) to scale up based on dpi, as well as teach all relevant applications to not position things in dpi-dependent ways
<beest>	afaict there's no system config in /etc anymore
<earnestly>	amadiro: fonts don't scale linearly
<earnestly>	!give amadiro rastertragedy
<phrik>	amadiro: http://www.rastertragedy.com/
<thrice>	i'm just confused, because on the same monitor + same app, and same configs, gnome appears much nicer.  i'd like to just get to that
<earnestly>	thrice: gnome's just looks smaller to me
<beest>	use a larger font
<beest>	also you probably want to turn on subpixel hinting
<thrice>	gnome also used slight hinting, rgb
<amadiro>	earnestly, doesn't sound like an issue to me, we can already scale fonts well, and other systems such as osx do a great job at rendering fonts at high dpis
<beest>	thrice: not the same thing
<earnestly>	!give amadiro g behdad subpixel
<phrik>	amadiro: high-dpi, subpixel text positioning, hinting - google docs: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wpzggmqxgit6fbvao76epnnfc_rqpdvkswrdqwyqo1m/edit>
<earnestly>	amadiro: not really
<thrice>	beest: explain?
<earnestly>	but, it's probably acceptable
<beest>	subpixel hinting gets switched on in an environment variable (on arch's shipping freetype)
<amadiro>	"not really" what?
<earnestly>	amadiro: it's not really a good job, and it's not an easy thing to hack around
<d_garbage>	special hax
<earnestly>	and it is hacks, all font rendering is hacks sadly
<earnestly>	but read those documents
<thrice>	changing to hinting: none doesn't alter the appearance
<amadiro>	earnestly, no idea what you mean by "not really a good job", if you look at some rendered fonts on android, ios devices or osx systems with retina displays, it looks absolutely fantastic.
<d_garbage>	fonts are a lot more complicated than, well, meets the eye :)
<thrice>	fonts on linux are terrible
<earnestly>	amadiro: those devices have enough pixel density to make hinting completely hide the problems
<beest>	amadiro: that's because you have a significantly higher resolution display with a much higher dpi
<floralshoppe>	thrice, if you mean font rendering then its your own fault its terrible
<thrice>	beest: but overriden by the de, surely
<earnestly>	hinting becomes essentially complete at about 250-300 dpi
<beest>	thrice: what?
<thrice>	floralshoppe: i'm aware, but it's not quite clear how to fix it
<d_garbage>	and your fonts are feeling like tv actors with less than perfect skin
<thrice>	beest: in gnome, changing the hinting in tweak-tool changes the appearance
<earnestly>	also because google docs is pain, i'll upload it as a pdf somewhere, assuming the pdf generation is acceptable
<beest>	thrice: which you can't use to set subpixel hinting
<kaipee>	i have a slightly strange issue on an arch system. i'm trying to set up a touchscreen. on ubuntu the serial device is registered as /dev/ttys4 (allowing me to assign the correct module). on my arch system, it only detects up to /dev/ttys3 - and none of those seem to be the touchscreen input
<kaipee>	any ideas?
<d_garbage>	you know they had to invent special makeup for hd video? because the actors looked to 'real' :p
<thrice>	beest: are you being purposefully daft?
<amadiro>	earnestly, yeah, those are the kind of screens the kde/qt/gnome devs are worried about, afaiu
<amadiro>	those are also the kind of screens where gnome/kde still looks... not great on
<earnestly>	amadiro: i don't think you do, but it's okay
<earnestly>	amadiro: font scaling is not linear, the second document explores how to do scaling with that in mind
<thrice>	also, the font appears nicer in xfce4-terminal
<earnestly>	feel free to read it, behdad is the gnome guy for fontconfig/freetype stuff
<beest>	thrice: no, but you're being accidentally daft, i'm done
<d_garbage>	thrice, https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/35274
<phrik>	title: fs#35274 : [freetype2] 2.4.11: enable subpixel hinting (at bugs.archlinux.org)
<earnestly>	(the pdf generated makes the images blurry, sigh)
<thrice>	beest: i mean, you're speaking in really bad generalities, if you don't have specific advice, that's fine, but stop pretneding to :-)
<tomfyuri>	hey, i installed package "mygui" and wanted to check it's demos in /opt/mygui/ directory but not a single one launch, they all error with "cannot open shared library libcommon.so". can anyone confirm they are actually working? (mygui is archlinux's package from offical repo)
<amadiro>	earnestly, sure, and...? it's clearly a solved problem...
<d_garbage>	i think it would be even better if beest did as they liked and you stopped telling them what to do. i guess we all have opinions on this
<amadiro>	anyway, i don't think it's fair to say the des are ignoring it
<earnestly>	what surprises me is your unwillingness to read the research into this problem, then claim it's solved.
<sudokode>	hi
<d_garbage>	o/
<earnestly>	it's like saying that the cap theorm has been solved, or more obviously, that the halting problem has been solved.
<amadiro>	earnestly, i've read some of it, but you'll have to work a bit harder than that to convince me that it's relevant
<amadiro>	seems pretty irrelevant to me
<earnestly>	i'm not required to convince you of anything
<d_garbage>	amadiro, have you made your own fonts? earnestly has
<namarrgon>	tomfyuri: which package provides that file?
<amadiro>	yes, i have
<earnestly>	that doesn't really matter
<tomfyuri>	namarrgon: mygui
<namarrgon>	tomfyuri: i mean "libcommon.so"
<sudokode>	earnestly: i heard cold fusion is possible too
<tomfyuri>	namarrgon: i have no idea what that is
<sudokode>	what's going on anyway
<namarrgon>	!give tomfyuri pkgfile
<phrik>	tomfyuri: pkgfile is a tool to find out what package owns a file, even if said package is not installed. pacman -s pkgfile; pkgfile -u
<earnestly>	sudokode: :p
<tomfyuri>	sure, wait a minute
<earnestly>	sudokode: apparently people have solved the problem of non-referential transparency
<d_garbage>	i wonder if bussard's old company has gotten anywhere with their fusion prototype yet?
<sudokode>	well, i'd like to buy that person a drink
<tomfyuri>	namarrgon: no matches
<sudokode>	along with any person that can tell me what non-referential transparency is
<earnestly>	sudokode: next they'll get rid of silly laws like the 0th law of thermodynamics
<namarrgon>	tomfyuri: are you sure it's an upper-case "c"?
<sudokode>	earnestly: most people don't even realize there is a 0th law
<tomfyuri>	namarrgon: /opt/mygui/demo_colour: error while loading shared libraries: libcommon.so: cannot open shared object file: no such file or directory
<sudokode>	probably because the only people stupid enough to start counting at 0 are computer scientists
<tomfyuri>	namarrgon: you see i'm not sure it even exists
<tomfyuri>	namarrgon: i'm thinking about trying arch rollback repo to see maybe it's simply broken since some update
<earnestly>	sudokode: :d, besides, it's not a law used in stupid arguments,
<sudokode>	heh that too
<woodennails>	any of you guys play games like world of warcraft on arch
<woodennails>	?
<pirithous>	hell no
<d_garbage>	ah good, research is on-going. may happen yet
<beest>	woodennails: there are many people who use wine to play wow, yes
<earnestly>	woodennails: do you have a question?
<d_garbage>	i always meant to try wow. it's free to play for the first couple of levels, isn't it?
<sudokode>	d_garbage: think you get 24 hours of play
<tomfyuri>	namarrgon: tried bunch from http://seblu.net/a/arm/packages/m/mygui/ all have same error
<phrik>	title: index of /a/arm/packages/m/mygui/ (at seblu.net)
<d_garbage>	i'd just like to look around the world, not really interested in playing the actual game though
<sudokode>	i still haven't tried wow. i'd probably hate it for 23 hours and then it'd get interesting
<earnestly>	d_garbage: if you really want to, you'd probably want to try find a good private server, but good luck with that
<beest>	i haven't played wow in ... gosh, must be seven or eight years now
<d_garbage>	i guess
<namarrgon>	tomfyuri: looks like a bug then
<namarrgon>	tomfyuri: your system is fully up to date?
<earnestly>	it was a good game, probably the best mechanics for an action rpg where not only timing and skill matter, but numbers still matter.
<earnestly>	almost no game gets this balance right
<tomfyuri>	namarrgon: aww, yes, fully up to date
<earnestly>	either it's all numbers or all skill
<hejki>	earnestly: yes, and then the tbc came rolling in and the fscked up the whole thing :>
<beest>	yeah, my ex and i stopped not terribly long after bc
<hejki>	aq40 in vanilla was just awesome
<earnestly>	hejki: i didn't like the first game very much
<earnestly>	the mechanics were boring
<earnestly>	and buggy as fuck
<tomfyuri>	namarrgon: i still wanted someone else to confirm this for me by trying those demos themselves...
<d_garbage>	i watched quite a bit of videos about it. there's someone on youtube called wowcrendor i like and he does that kind of thing, machinimas and so on
<earnestly>	bc cleaned it up, a lot, and greatly improved the ui and plugin api
<hejki>	yes
<earnestly>	then i kind of stopped
<hejki>	but the balance went haywire in tbc
<hejki>	esp. pvp
<namarrgon>	tomfyuri: still downloading, might take a while
<earnestly>	hejki: there was no balance in the first game, are you serious?
<tomfyuri>	namarrgon: sure
<hejki>	i should know, i played feral druid + rogue in 2v2 arena in top10 ;>
<namarrgon>	tomfyuri: there is a 'libcommon.so' in htdig but that seems unrelated
<hejki>	earnestly: pvp specs were really balanced imo, you could not roll any spec for pvp, but those viable for pvp were quite in balance imo
<earnestly>	they were not
<earnestly>	go back and play it
<earnestly>	you're not remembering at all
<hejki>	could be nostalgia
<hejki>	:p
<d_garbage>	then there's that infamous story about that 'funeral' that was held in wow that got raided. fascinating story
<hejki>	well
<earnestly>	indeed
<hejki>	i played warlock, druid and warrior
<hejki>	:)
<earnestly>	d_garbage: there were a bunch like that
<tomfyuri>	namarrgon: i tried htdig, it's unrelated
<drew]>	does anyone here use nftables?
<hejki>	tbc pve content was quite... content :)
<hejki>	bt was semiboring
<d_garbage>	odd because you could see both sides of the 'argument'
<d_garbage>	at the same time
<hejki>	mh was awsum
<earnestly>	anyway, it was a mechanically great game, no idea what it's like now
<hejki>	it is quite casual these days
<earnestly>	sudokode: dave wrote a plugin for it ;p
<hejki>	and all classes can do anything
<hejki>	there is no really any variance anymore
<sudokode>	what
<hejki>	paladins have hots and other shit
<namarrgon>	tomfyuri: can you rebuild the package from abs and see if that lib is somewhere in $srcdir?
<earnestly>	sudokode: i shit ye not
<sudokode>	for what?
<hejki>	earnestly: you ever tried out poe? :)
<sudokode>	oh
<sudokode>	er
<drew]>	i'm trying to decide if i should use nftables instead of iptables, but i'm not sure if it's ready yet to be a better replacement
<sudokode>	man these bikes are loud
<sudokode>	drew]: depends on what features you need
<sudokode>	make a list and we'll let you know
<sudokode>	or better yet, show us your old iptables rules
<earnestly>	hejki: i don't really like those kinds of games, mechanically they're okay (torchlight), but poe is just a grind fest to me, not a fan.
<spareproject>	does nftables have recent module functionality?
<sudokode>	no
<spareproject>	:(
<sudokode>	afaik
<hejki>	earnestly: ok, it is quite well mechanically, and the talent stuff is just awesome =)
<sudokode>	spareproject: you can use limit though
<earnestly>	hejki: sure, although i didn't find a way to reset the talent trees to try other ideas
<earnestly>	hejki: without restarting
<sudokode>	which is like a dumbed down version of recent
<hejki>	earnestly: talent calculators
<drew]>	well i have almost no experience setting up firewalls but i just set up my desktop to face the internet so i feel like i should use one now
<earnestly>	hejki: i don't really want to spend my time in excel
<earnestly>	hejki: just for the want to try different things, it's not like i'm min-maxing, i don't care about it.
<earnestly>	having to restart if you want to try something else is enough to kill that game outright
<beest>	you mean starting new characters? wow got talent tree resets (for gold), i think pre-bc even
<earnestly>	beest: yes
<drew]>	i'm running subsonic and apache through airvpn if that makes any difference
<beest>	which got awful when you were expected to change your talent tree before every raid
<earnestly>	beest: but this is a f2p game (poe) so they will find ways to disrespect your time as much as possible, even if they're one of the best ethically speaking
<tomfyuri>	namarrgon: sure, building
<beest>	ohhhh poe
<sudokode>	power over ethernet?
<earnestly>	beest: i didn't mind the gold costs, it was not fun though
<earnestly>	at least you could, though
<beest>	min-maxing just isn't much fun for me in general, when i spend more time tweaking than i actually spend playing it's no longer a game
<spyhawk>	yes it is!
<spyhawk>	tweaking can be the game itself :p
<tomfyuri>	namarrgon: during building there is mygui-mygui3.2.2/build/lib/libcommon.so
<mirazi_heket>	is it possible to turn on exit codes in linux terminal while launching any app in terminal (c++ or any else program; saw it on archiso)?
<spyhawk>	see ksp, for example.
<tomfyuri>	namarrgon: and stuff is being linked to it
<namarrgon>	tomfyuri: probably a packaging issue, file a ticket on the bugtracker
<earnestly>	mirazi_heket: various shells have shell options to enable exit code reporting after the command
<tomfyuri>	namarrgon: i copied that libcommon.so to /usr/lib/ and now demos work
<earnestly>	mirazi_heket: e.g. zsh's printexitvalue
<tomfyuri>	namarrgon: it's like nobody used that package ever...
<bushido_>	i3 wm urxvt color
<guest81119>	how do i stop a program reading from stdin? i thought it was ctrl-d, but that doesn't do it
<bushido_>	change to
<guest81119>	the program is xxd
<bushido_>	chang e
<bushido_>	urxvt color red .. i3 wm
<namarrgon>	tomfyuri: that may be the case, i've never heard of it before just now :p
<pid1>	mirazi_heket, i don't know about bash. zsh has some great built-in prompts that give you the exit code of the prior command.
<wasamasa>	there's also $?
<wasamasa>	which you can just incorporate into the prompt
<tomfyuri>	namarrgon: i see
<gehidore>	guest81119: wrap it in a trap perhaps
<thelemonman>	guest81119, ctrl-c
<utack>	cinnamon uses 1.4gb ram. is that normal under circumstances or a memleak?
<mirazi_heket>	pid1: #!/bin/sh -e, thats for sh according to internet
<earnestly>	nah
<earnestly>	mirazi_heket: for bash, you could add something like printf '%.*s' $? $? to your prompt
<mirazi_heket>	earnestly: will check, thanks
<bushido_>	how tog et the urxvt color  in i3 wm
<bushido_>	urxvt
<earnestly>	mirazi_heket: the hack uses $? in the * width field, so if it's 0, it won't leave a space in your prompt
<thraul>	utack: cinnamon is using 1.4gb ram here has well. i think that is normal....
<bushido_>	for_window [class="^urxvt$"] border 1pixel
<earnestly>	mirazi_heket: and a width of 0 means it won't print '0'
<guest81119>	ctrl-c kills the program, it doesn't give output. gehidore: what do you mean "wrap it in a trap"?
<guest81119>	oh wait, i should just use   < echo -n mywords   perhaps
<utack>	thraul thanks
<earnestly>	mirazi_heket: i do wonder if bash has a way to do this nicely, ask #bash.  zsh's printexitvalue looks something like: http://ix.io/ifk/sh
<utack>	not excatly a slim de....
<thelemonman>	guest81119, i usually put a | $(pager) to avoid those problems
<utack>	i wonder why. what the hell uses 1.4gb
<earnestly>	guest81119: you should probably stop using echo
<earnestly>	there is almost no reason to use it ;/
<guest81119>	earnestly: you're right
<bushido_>	urxvt color change
<mirazi_heket>	thanks for help
<thraul>	just looked at htop again. cinnamon --replace is using virt 1.5gb res 175mb....hmmmm
<bushido_>	i2 wm anyone know about the color
<bushido_>	change clinet.focus
<bushido_>	for_window [class="^urxvt$"] border 1pixel
<pid1>	bushido_, stop. you've asked three times in 6 minutes.
<bushido_>	i got the color on the broder
<thelemonman>	echo shouldn't block when piped into xxd :|
<earnestly>	thraul: now you have to go look up what virt and res means and how to read it
<bushido_>	pid1: yeah okay
<bushido_>	let put it all together
<earnestly>	thelemonman: codepoint() { printf '%s' "$1" | xxd -ps } # heh
<earnestly>	thelemonman: teapot earnest %i master ~ codepoint 𝑛
<earnestly>	f09d919b
<thraul>	hehe virt max it will use res current in use mem....
<bushido_>	for_window [class="^urxvt$"] border 1pixel  this si the line urxvt color , i got he colors in the broder .. butget the config to change the color.
<thelemonman>	earnestly, i use vim's g8
<earnestly>	thelemonman: yeah, also a nice way
<earnestly>	thraul: on 64 bit machines, each process can use like 2^64 -1 virt
<vmassuchetto>	can i follow a 'systemctl status' output as in 'tail -f'?
<earnestly>	actually no
<earnestly>	2^47-1
<earnestly>	(kernel reserves 1)
<earnestly>	vmassuchetto: less +f is better than tail
<earnestly>	vmassuchetto: also, not really, status' output doesn't update like that
<vmassuchetto>	earnestly, ok
<beest>	vmassuchetto: systemctl status is just journalctl output for that unit, use `journalctl -f -u unitname'
<beest>	or something
<thelemonman>	earnestly, g8 gives you the utf8 codepoint while ga gives the decoded unicode one :d
<earnestly>	status isn't really journal related
<beest>	i think he's wanting the logs that print at the end of status.
<earnestly>	thelemonman: yeah, there's a load of cool stuff behind the 'g' namespace, i only know a few
<earnestly>	beest: "systemctl status" is very different to "systemctl status <unit>" though
<beest>	also i made a gender assumption that i never do, bad beest
<earnestly>	gender is irrelevant, english doesn't have a way to be "nutral", it doesn't matter, no one really cares
<earnestly>	neutral*
<earnestly>	well, no one who is interesting cares ;p
<beest>	i care and i'm fucking interesting
<earnestly>	beest: i mean, people who care if they're called he, she, it, whatever on irc
<earnestly>	or any other anonymous place
<beest>	and yeah, <status> is a pretty safe assumption to make considering they're trying to -f it which wouldn't be useful with just `systemctl status`?
<earnestly>	beest: you should run 'systemctl status' and see what it looks like
<beest>	erm s/<status>/<unit
<beest>	you should tail -f `systemctl status` and see what it looks like
<beest>	i think one of us is misunderstanding what someone who has long left and can't defend themselves is trying to do
<beest>	i think they were just trying to follow the unit log snippet that posts at the end of a status on a unit
<beest>	without realizing it's just the journal
<earnestly>	beest: you say that, but they pretty explicitly said 'systemctl status', literally, including the quotes.  so idk, xy problem, we're both guessing
<woodennails>	is there any need to create a swap partition?
<openfbtd>	depends.
<beest>	earnestly: you've been here long enough to know that people never say what they mean in here :d
<svanheulen>	i'm trying to set usbhid quirks for multiple devices, but it seems like only the last option line in my modprobe config sticks. i'm guessing it each time i set quirks it overwrites the previous setting?
<earnestly>	beest: but the quotes!  not many do that :p
<earnestly>	beest: yeah, xy problems all over the place, it's tricky
<openfbtd>	woodennails, i prefer to have one in case my 16g of memory get eaten by something and i actually notice that i'm out of mem
<openfbtd>	instead of oom killer coming and killing my browser
<beest>	earnestly: fair enough but not many seem to know that `systemctl status` is even a thing
<earnestly>	svanheulen: pretty much
<woodennails>	openfbtd, i have 16gb mem too
<beest>	(minus a unit)
<woodennails>	openfbtd, just tryign to work out how to partition my drives as i have ssd and hdd
<openfbtd>	never actually happened, but i don't lose anything by having 16g swap.
<earnestly>	beest: it's fairly useless as well, because it doesn't really tell you what has degraded
<beest>	woodennails: it's not likely you'll ever need it and you can happily use a swapfile if you start doing particle physics calculations that require it
<openfbtd>	woodennails, oh, my swap is a file :)
<svanheulen>	earnestly: super... you wouldn't happen to know how to set quirks for mulltiple devices at once then, would you? :)
<earnestly>	and if one wanted the nice tree output, they'd use systemd-cgls
<beest>	yup
<earnestly>	svanheulen: nope
<svanheulen>	dang
<beest>	hell, the box i'm on now only has 4gb and my swap never gets touched aside from the odd dirty page, but i also travel pretty lightly and don't use 4000 browser tabs
<eleventh>	4gb is more than enough unless heavy gaming or virtualizing
<svanheulen>	your system basically grinds to a halt if you're using enough ram to need swap so i don't really see the point
<ruan>	it doesn't, the process consuming the most memory is killed
<openfbtd>	beest, it all depends on usage, yeah. my work pc also has 4, and i sometimes forget that i only have 4. which results in heavy swapping till i notice the machine running real slow
<eleventh>	swap is nessesary if you are going to suspend
<ruan>	oh, i use zram
<svanheulen>	ruan: ah ok, i've only ever had "swap" come into play on windows and that's what happens there lol
<ruan>	without swap, or when swap is full, the oom killer kills the "worst" process
<earnestly>	it still waits a long time to kill
<openfbtd>	which is exactly why it's useful for those weird scenarios where you're out of ram
<earnestly>	and can grind the system to a halt for minutes or even hours.  yeah, you've long since powered off at this point
<ruan>	under a desktop system i've experienced it working quite as intended
<ruan>	with a recent 3.x kernel
<earnestly>	lucky you, you've never experienced a run away process in the extreme then
<openfbtd>	yeah, i too have never seen oomk waiting long
<earnestly>	also, this is on 3.x and 4.x
<beest>	ruan: you mean zram?
<earnestly>	with cfq and bfq
<ruan>	the oom killer
<tylerdurden01>	!swap
<beest>	yeah, it's almost never graceful, even when processes are supposed to be trapping for oom
<ruan>	was using the ck kernel at the time, switched back
<openfbtd>	every time it happens, it's like: oh that porn site looks go-god dammit where is my browser
<beest>	boobies are such memory hogs
<openfbtd>	mostly because i forgot to power down two vms and apachedirectorystudio
<openfbtd>	it's really easy to get used to your machine easily handling a few vms running all the time and then forget that your work pc is not like the home one >_>
<sheraf>	how can i prevent ssh to display: connect_to localhost port 80: failed.
<cirrus_minor>	dont use port 80 for ssh ?
<beest>	are you trying to proxy?
<sudokode>	and so allergy season begins
<sudokode>	oh well. as long as it's nice outside
<shadowkatstudios>	how do i make my lightdm gtk greeter's background scale?
<beest>	when it's nice outside i'm usually miserable inside :/
<sudokode>	why so weak
<beest>	my head is a giant fucking barometer
<beest>	not to mention that i have ehlers-danlos and tennessee hurts my fucked-up joints more than normal
<beest>	the only thing i miss when i'm not in the tropics
<binero>	hello
<binero>	i have a pretty annoying audio issue
<binero>	my audio gets cut off
<binero>	like a few miliseconds at the start and end of audio
<binero>	which is annoying for sound editing
<binero>	it happens everywhere, so i think it must be something pulse related
<utack>	thraul cinnamon crepped up to 2.1gb, definitly a memleak for me
<carogila>	hi :)
<sudokode>	i'm at 4.03g
<sudokode>	mostly firefox and mpv
<sudokode>	and deluge
<sudokode>	firefox is at 24% of memory, so about 2g
<carogila>	i've just installed arch on my computer and i have mainly one issue: when gdm is started my touchpad works fine but once i've logged in, the pointer doesn't move any longer (but the button are still functionnal).
<utack>	sudokode cinnamon alone uses 2.1gb, and about an hour ago it was 1.4gb
<utack>	so it definitly has some memleak
<carogila>	would you know why?
<beest>	utack: i think you're probably misreading htop
<sudokode>	utack: probably
<sudokode>	i blame flash for firefox's issues
<wurstmann>	utack: look in the res column in htop
<utack>	virt and res: 3620.9m 2.206g
<wurstmann>	oo
<utack>	i used the gnome system monitor before, but it says the same
<cpnl>	wr
<cpnl>	did you install any extra mouse drivers carogila? that happened to me at first with mtrack too, probably since gdm is using wayland
<utack>	i will see if it is happening again
<utack>	if yes i can look into it
<cpnl>	otherwise wouldn't work there either
<carogila>	cnpl: nope at all, i've installed almost nothing yet
<carogila>	this touchpad is focaltech and i use linux kernel >4 then it should works fine.
<carogila>	actually, it shoulsat least move the pointer ^^ i don't understand why the pointer doesn't move while buttons are still listened to.
<carogila>	well, i've just found the graphical output i'm using is tty2 but gdm is still showing login screen in tty1. wtf??
<carogila>	maybe it's because of this: pointer may be locked by first tty.
<error404notfound>	for an aur packages based on someone else's repository, is there a way i can automate rebuilding pkgbuild against latest commit and upload it?
<error404notfound>	s/packages/package/
<mrelendig>	sure
<mrelendig>	makepkg does this for you already
<infides>	hey guys, is there a way to change the display resolution in the zsh shell at the installation process?
<tom^>	infides: depending on your gpu, but it should be automaticly detected
<beest>	probably easier to change the font if you're on hi-dpi
<infides>	ok, i have a 4k display and the font is really tiny
<tomty89>	how nice is nomodeset
<beest>	infides: setfont sun12x22
<infides>	beest: thx
<mrelendig>	why change the res when you can just select a larger font
<augustas>	note: swap partitions must not be mounted here. umout /dev/sda2(here is my swap)
<beest>	especially since you'll ostensibly only be in console for a few minutes
<augustas>	this command will work for unmount?
<mrelendig>	swapoff
<augustas>	thanks
<infides>	was not sure what to do, but setfont works well
<error404notfound>	ah, ok, i guess i got some rtfm'ing to do.
<tomty89>	guess we soon need hidpi-ready console
<infides>	yeah, would be great
<tomty89>	otherwise kms would be further meh
<beest>	not really, just moar bigger console fonts
<jushur>	4k console
<tomty89>	beest: can't we be saved from adjusting ourself :p
<beest>	i never stop adjusting myself
<beest>	look at it
<tomty89>	error: focal length not supported
<jushur>	4k res on console with ter-112n font, need a amplifier to read it.
<augustas>	i am in begginers guide and in category mount the partitions  if the root partition's name is sdxr, do:
<augustas>	# mount /dev/sdxr /mnt
<augustas>	 so i need to write mount /dev/sda /mnt or mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
<homerj>	you need one of those microfiche readers
<tomty89>	augustas: you just don't know what's sda and sda1. not about mount
<tomty89>	perhaps fdisk -l helps
<augustas>	i know that sda is raw device but like sda1 is partitions
<tomty89>	actually it's possible you can use mount for either of them
<tomty89>	depending on the case
<tomty89>	augustas: so think, if you have two partitions in a disk, hence sda, sda1 and sda2, what do you think you'll use if you want to mount one of the two partitions
<lebenserfahrung>	guys how is the nexus 6 as a device?
<tomty89>	hmm nexus 6 is popular in this channel huh
<lebenserfahrung>	i am planning to get rid of my iphone 6 plus and get one :p
<augustas>	tomty89 sda because this is head of sda1 and sda2 ?
<tomty89>	...
<tomty89>	augustas: but you want to mount a partition
<tomty89>	augustas: if you use sda, how can `mount` know which one you want
<tomty89>	remeber you have two now
<augustas>	tomty89 so i need to mount every partitions ?
<tomty89>	every one you want to mount, yes
<augustas>	tomty89 how to hide my ip in irc?
<tomty89>	no idea
<tomty89>	i'm an irc noob
<tylerdurden01>	augustas: ask in #freenode for a "cloak"
<lebenserfahrung>	augustas: /mode yournick +x
<mrelendig>	a cloak is not reliable
<mrelendig>	tor is more reliable, but freenode have disabled the hidden service and blocks most of the public exit nodes due to abuse
<tylerdurden01>	mrelendig: really? how would one find my ip even with a cloak?
<mrelendig>	tylerdurden01: if you identify too late, or the services are down
<mrelendig>	depending on client/config you can abuse dcc to get the ip too
<tylerdurden01>	mrelendig: that seems unlikely
<mrelendig>	or you connect trough the web gateway
<mrelendig>	tylerdurden01: happens all the time actually
<augustas>	but now i am without nothing because like hackergeek showing ip near nickname  hackergeek (~hackergee@199.19.94.135) has joined
<teraflop>	mrelendig: if you when are in query it shows the ip no matter if you have cloak?
<tomty89>	<3 tomty89 is unknown (~user@014199149146.ctinets.com)
<howdoitype>	do i need xorg to run wayland?
<tomty89>	not necesarily
<mrelendig>	howdoitype: ofcourse not
<mrelendig>	you need x to run apps that have not been ported to wayland
<howdoitype>	is xorg-server-xwayland enough for that?
<mrelendig>	usually
<howdoitype>	alright, thanks
<augustas>	i trying to mount: unable to read superblock
<augustas>	not mounted something or what?
<ruukasu>	i added the infinality-bundle repo and the necessary key, and it's still giving me "database 'infinality-bundle' is not valid (invalid or corrupted database (pgp signature))" whenever i -syu
<kaikas>	slim works with fprintd now. but slimlock does not. any ideas what i need to do to unlock slimlock with my fingerprint?
<mrelendig>	ruukasu: import and lsign the key
<namarrgon>	augustas: what are you trying to mount? and how?
<augustas>	trying to install arch, and need to mount partitions because need to create /home /boot
<ruukasu>	mrelendig: thanks
<namarrgon>	augustas: you already partitioned the disk?
<augustas>	all worked to install in sd1, not figure out why not working to mount on sda3 (sda2 swap_
<augustas>	yes
<namarrgon>	augustas: you formated them?
<augustas>	yes, pressed write
<namarrgon>	pressed write?
<augustas>	or that not enough?
<namarrgon>	did you run "mkfs.<xyz>" on them?
<aidancollier>	can anyone help with the awesome wm? i haven't gotten any responses on the awesome irc.
<augustas>	namarrgon oh i need to do mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdxy with every portition?
<tom^>	aidancollier: not without you asking what it is you need help with.
<mrelendig>	augustas: did you ask in their channel on oftc?
<wurstmann>	augustas: yes tbh
<namarrgon>	augustas: if you want to use ext4, yes.
<wurstmann>	augustas: *yes you have to
<namarrgon>	augustas: except for swap, that is
<namarrgon>	augustas: are you not reading the beginners' guide?
<augustas>	thanks, that was my problem i think. mrelendig what is this?
<disappointment>	!give augustas beginners
<phrik>	augustas: read this! all of it, twice! your answer is probably here! http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/beginners%27_guide
<augustas>	yes i know
<mrelendig>	augustas: was for aidancollier
<augustas>	i read that alot and try to understand not for first time. keep searching inside,i knew that command.
<disappointment>	augustas: it's not that difficult to understand, just need a bit of time :p
<aidancollier>	tom: i'm having a few quirks with it. first, my widgets are not given any margins in the wibox, as you can see here:http://imgur.com/gr92e46. this is easily seen in the '0m11:58' part, where the '0m' is actually my volume widget and the '11:58' is the clock widget. what variables exactly do i need to change to add say, a 5px margin in between each widget? i've looked for fixes, but all of them have kicked me back to the
<aidancollier>	fallback configuration until i removed their code.
<howdoitype>	i got an error while trying to launch weston
<howdoitype>	http://dpaste.com/16gwa5y
<phrik>	title: dpaste: 16gwa5y (at dpaste.com)
<namarrgon>	why are you running it as root?
<howdoitype>	i literally installed arch 5 minutes ago, i haven't even made a user account yet
<namarrgon>	that's your first priority then, not wayland
<mrelendig>	howdoitype: making an account should be the first thing you do after the first boot
<howdoitype>	k i made the user account
<howdoitype>	still have the error when trying to launch weston
<disappointment>	huh, khan academy has made something called katex?
<holomorph>	evidently.
<disappointment>	never heard of it before.
<aidancollier>	mrelendig: yes, i did ask on oftc.
<augustas>	dissappointment i see that fstab need only run one time. but why? why if i run one more time?
<augustas>	what bad can be happen?
<namarrgon>	howdoitype: pacman -qs mesa
<howdoitype>	glu lib32-libtxc-dxtn lib32-mesa lib32-mesa-libgl libtxc-dxtn mesa mesa-libgl
<tom^>	howdoitype: which gpu?
<howdoitype>	intel
<howdoitype>	more specifically intel atom processor integrated graphics controller
<namarrgon>	poulsbo?
<disappointment>	augustas: i've never tried doing it, so i simply don't know, but i guess it might generate invalid/empty file.
<augustas>	dang, grub problems
<markamber>	just got back from co-op in summer and fall and school in spring and booted up my arch box and did some upgrading (about 10 months worth)!
<augustas>	working. thank you guys!
<augustas>	!give disappointment cookie
<phrik>	disappointment: augustas wanted you to have this cookie.
<mneuro>	is there a way to have a volume applet on the xfce panel in arch?
<augustas>	!give namarrgon cookie
<phrik>	namarrgon: augustas wanted you to have this cookie.
<mrelendig>	mneuro: just install and run one
<teraflop>	howdoitype: i have the same issue from tty and gdm but i can do weston inside xorg, intelhd 3000 gpu here
<mneuro>	mrelendig which one can you install and run?  according to the arch wiki, xfce4 mixer and xfce4 volumed are no longer maintained
<howdoitype>	teraflop: i guess i'll have to install xorg then
<mrelendig>	there are loads of them
<mneuro>	mrelendig, "loads of them" doesn't help
<mrelendig>	personally i would just set up some keybindings instead
<teraflop>	howdoitype: i already have xorg installed
<tom^>	aidancollier: i just create a texbox widget containing a space in such cases.
<tom^>	aidancollier: and smack that in :p
<disappointment>	yay cookies.
<markamber>	what is the current best method to deal with aur packages now... back when i last used it i used cower but that is out of date it seems
<mrelendig>	markamber: no
<mrelendig>	markamber: why do you think that using cower is "out of date"?
<tom^>	huh cower is not out of date
<youngwolf>	hey fellas
<youngwolf>	cannot connect to internet on static host name
<youngwolf>	only can connect via transient host name
<mneuro>	mrelendig you are a troll
<markamber>	where is cower development happening? where can i get a recent version
<mneuro>	mrelendig, people are asking for help, not your short non-answers
<cloudef>	cower is developed at the farm
<holomorph>	markamber: yours might be out of date, seeing as you haven't upgraded for 10 months
<mrelendig>	mneuro: ?
<holomorph>	!gh falconindy/cower
<phrik>	holomorph: falconindy/cower · github: <https://github.com/falconindy/cower>
<mrelendig>	mneuro: how am i trolling?
<tom^>	by not spoonfeeding
<mneuro>	people are asking for help and you are responding to them not giving them answers
<mrelendig>	mneuro: ?
<mrelendig>	mneuro: example please
<mneuro>	after you i asked if there is a way to install a volume applet in xfce you said "yes loads of them"
<mneuro>	that isn't an answer
<tom^>	mneuro: so you mean you think this channel is the "let us google/wikipedia search for you. channel" ?
<mneuro>	tom^ i clearly stated i already read the wiki and pointed out that it said that the normal 2 ways are no longer maintained
<mrelendig>	mneuro: it is
<mrelendig>	mneuro: http://bit.ly/1zndgn9
<phrik>	title: let me google that for you (at bit.ly)
<mneuro>	tom^ so i was asking the people here if there was another way
<holomorph>	yeah
<mrelendig>	mneuro: it literally is a valid answer to your question
<holomorph>	it's linked in the fucking section in the wiki
<mrelendig>	mneuro: "are there any blue cars?"
<mrelendig>	"yes, lots"
<cloudef>	blue cars are quite rare
<mrelendig>	perfectly valid answer
<mrelendig>	cloudef: not around here
<holomorph>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/list_of_applications#volume_managers
<phrik>	title: list of applications - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<mneuro>	holomorph no it is not
<cloudef>	i see mostly white, black and red cars
<holomorph>	!reading
<phrik>	reading is a virtue. and also something you don't know how to do.
<mneuro>	i ask for an xfce volume applet, and the arch tards recommend i install a gtk volume applet
<grawity>	"technically valid answer" is not an excuse for being a jerk
<mneuro>	arch is supposed to be about not installing 100 extra useless libraries
<grawity>	being a chanop is also not an exuse for being a jerk
<howdoitype>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xfce#xfce4_mixer
<phrik>	title: xfce - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<codebam>	what package is genfstab in?
<howdoitype>	it still works even though it's not being maintained
<namarrgon>	!give codebam pkgfile
<phrik>	codebam: pkgfile is a tool to find out what package owns a file, even if said package is not installed. pacman -s pkgfile; pkgfile -u
<mneuro>	howdoitype xfce4-mixer is no longer maintained
<codebam>	namarrgon: thansk
<howdoitype>	mneuro: but it still works perfectly
<codebam>	*thanks
<mneuro>	it does not work with newer gstreamer
<aidancollier>	tom: i saw there were layout margin properties that could be used for widgets here: http://tinyurl.com/mkpjecu . i couldn't see exactly how to apply the functions from the documentation (the last time i read it) though. would you know how to use them, by chance?
<mneuro>	it clearly states that on the wiki
<teraflop>	weekends here are funny
<junka>	teraflop; ^^
<howdoitype>	it has worked fine for me for the last few weeks.
<namarrgon>	you have a funny definition of funny
<alcyius>	greetings.
<alcyius>	is anyone here familiar with using jazip?
<beest>	also "weekend", it's been a weekend in here for the past two weeks
<grawity>	mneuro: however, arch *isn't* about not installing 100 extra libraries
<alcyius>	because i can't make heads or tails of it and i need to get stuff off of my great-grandmother's zip disks
<tom^>	aidancollier: hm no not really, i dont know lua that much
<grawity>	mneuro: and given that xfce is all based around gtk, recommending a gtk applet sounds reasonable
<mneuro>	grawity yes it is, it is about installing only what you need
<codebam>	namarrgon: wow, thats awesome. thanks
<mneuro>	you don't need 100 libraries for gtk to use a volume applet in xfce
<grawity>	yes you do because every single part of xfce is gtk-based
<beest>	you probably already have most of those, you're using xfce
<howdoitype>	aand he's gone.
<thrice>	the xfce-pulseaudio mixer is really good
<cloudef>	i like my volume wheel in keyboard
<howdoitype>	i just use the default one that comes with xfce
<alcyius>	anyone?
<markamber>	ok so i cloned and installed latest cower. i downloaded updates to my packages. i cant find in my history what command i was using to batch install a directory of directories of packages. would it have been pacaur
<beest>	i just turn down the big knob
<thrice>	there isn't a default with xfce 4.12
<thrice>	xfce4-mixer is dead
<howdoitype>	it works though
<howdoitype>	i see no reason of getting anything else. :p
<thrice>	it uses old gst stuff.  why not use the pulse mixer?
<grawity>	how about "it's going to break in 6 months and it's not going to be fixed" for a reason
<howdoitype>	well i'll use it until it breaks then
<junka>	howdoitype; you like it hard :p
<howdoitype>	all i need is the ability to turn my volume down from the taskbar when i need to, and as long as it can provide me with that, i have no reason to switch. :p
<mrelendig>	howdoitype: why not use keybindings?
<mrelendig>	like those fancy volume keys you have on your keyboard?
<teraflop>	heh
<razorx>	?
<junka>	xfce-mixer provides those too
<junka>	iirc
<howdoitype>	i don't have volume keys on my keyboard
<lyonsb>	(you lack alt+shift+f7 ?  unless you have it bound to something else . . .)
<howdoitype>	lyonsb: it switches to my 7th workspace. i just noticed i have an unnecessary amount of workspaces o.o
<aidancollier>	tom^: okay. i'm also having an issue where fonts which appearing in webpages or applications under all of the other environments/wm's i've used (including openbox) are replaced by fairly funky fonts under awesome. i have one screenshot here with the case under awesome: http://imgur.com/e8ceqv6 . would this be work i need to do in awesome configuration, or would it just a be a need to install more fonts?
<phrik>	title: imgur (at imgur.com)
<int-main>	so i am looking for a arch distro with most vanilla experience and that works out of box (if possible gnome), any ideas which distro is good?
<howdoitype>	int-main:  arch linux
<tom^>	aidancollier: that doesnt matter which wm or de you use, its something else. missing fonts and it uses something funky to replace it with or similiar.
<int-main>	howdoitype: i said out of box
<howdoitype>	hmm
<tom^>	int-main: arch linux
<keenerd>	int-main: think outside of the box.
<int-main>	i cannot set it up via command line.
<tom^>	yes you can.
<wurstmann>	int-main: why not? just use the beginner's guide. it's not hard
<int-main>	i have problem with my internet. it needs a web login
<howdoitype>	int-main: try antergos
<howdoitype>	i'm honestly not sure about it, i've never looked into it at all
<grawity>	elinks should be able to handle most web logins
<int-main>	i am thinking archbang
<beest>	you're thinking too much
<keenerd>	antergos is better than archbang, at least.
<wurstmann>	just use a terminal browser like lynx
<aidancollier>	int-main:what exactly is the issue your internet?
<grawity>	other than that, "vanilla experience" and "works out of the box" are a contradiction
<grawity>	aidancollier: captive-portal logins
<int-main>	i meant most possible vanilla experience.
<wurstmann>	or use a live cd of another distro to install arc
<wurstmann>	*arch
<grawity>	int-main: that's regular arch then
<lyonsb>	howdoitype, well okay, you've got several other possible key combinations any of which would work for volume once set to xf86volumeup or xf86volumedown  -- mate and manmy other de's have an app for that, but if you prefer a console, there's that too.
<namarrgon>	oh, wow. weston starts without a hitch in a vmware guest
<aidancollier>	tom^: i was just wondering, because i haven't had this issue ever before.
<howdoitype>	namarrgon: i got mad at my weston for not starting so i wiped my disk
<teraflop>	namarrgon: what video driver?
<tom^>	aidancollier: because before you had the correct fonts installed.
<tom^>	aidancollier: ttf-dejavu or msfonts
<howdoitype>	i feel like weston has something against intel
<namarrgon>	teraflop: xf86-video-vmware :3
<teraflop>	damn true ^
<namarrgon>	howdoitype: have you found out which gpu you have?
<howdoitype>	namarrgon: i thought i already said it earlier. intel atom processor n450 integrated graphics controller
<tomty89>	lyonsb: aren't they xf86audioraisevolume xf86audiolowervolume
<namarrgon>	howdoitype: you omitted the model number the first time
<howdoitype>	ahh
<lyonsb>	tomty89, oh yeah, maybe so.
<lyonsb>	tomty89, was just from memory, + possible change from version to version.
<namarrgon>	"intel gma 3150" should work imho
<lyonsb>	tomty89, i suppose that could be somewhat confusing . . ."increase the size of my xorg install by 30 bits!  (volume?)"
<tomty89>	<_<
<aidancollier>	tom^: that fixes it!
<aidancollier>	bye!
<sudokode>	anyone near ocean city, md and wanna see the fight tonight?
<ravior>	i'm having a problem with my wireless interface. according to ifconfig it's name is 'wls1'. when i try to start it with rp-pppoe, i'm getting an invalid interface error.
<grawity>	uh, why would you run pppoe over a wireless interface
<grawity>	that's got to be the weirdest network i've heard of
<sudokode>	the wireless needs more ether
<crazedpsyc>	the oe bit seems to suggest that might not be a great idea
<ravior>	grawity, and it is. that's the way the internet connection was done around here.
<grawity>	well, wifi is close enough that it could technically work (it uses the same ethertypes, etc.)
<sudokode>	because ieee
<sudokode>	now if we can just tie it all together with 1394
<sudokode>	we'd control the world's communication
<grawity>	sudokode: ah, yeah, ip-over-firewire was a thing several years ago
<ravior>	the problem is only with this laptop. the thing that struck me in the beginning was it's name. it's the first time i've seen a interface that worked and didn't have the default naming code ('wlsxpy')
<sudokode>	lol
<grawity>	ravior: which "default naming code" are you talking about?
<grawity>	hrmm this would be easier if i could actually obtain ppp source code
<sudokode>	ravior: that's the udev rules from systemd
<sudokode>	!give ravior iface
<phrik>	ravior: https://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2013-january/024231.html http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/software/systemd/predictablenetworkinterfacenames
<crazedpsyc>	i don't understand the new if naming scheme still
<sudokode>	crazedpsyc: see above then
<sudokode>	enlighten thyself
<crazedpsyc>	ah, right
<sudokode>	ravior: you can undo all that by adding net.ifnames=0 to your kernel args
<ravior>	sudokode, i see
<crazedpsyc>	weird
<sudokode>	it makes more sense when you have more interfaces
<crazedpsyc>	i'm glad all my networking hardware is pci and fairly normal
<sudokode>	and ofc normally the names don't interfere with anything. it's just odd looking at first
<beest>	makes more sense when you look at lspci
<crazedpsyc>	i've never seen something other than wlpxsy and enpxsy
<ravior>	i didn't knew that. thanks for the info. i managed to make it work
<sudokode>	crazedpsyc: i've seen some eno1 sometimes, which is an odd one
<ravior>	when i said x and y, i wanted to say two numbers
<sudokode>	because the 'o' is for onboard, but pci stuff is also considered onboard
<crazedpsyc>	huh
<sudokode>	so i've always been confused about the difference
<beest>	sudokode: i think that's mostly for on-chip ethernet
<sudokode>	what is that
<crazedpsyc>	soc controller?
<sudokode>	hm
<sudokode>	do socs usually have the ethernet chip on them?
<beest>	yup
<beest>	and most of it doesn't get enumerated through pci
<sudokode>	embedded
<sudokode>	:<
<heftig>	it depends on what the firmware reports
<heftig>	if it reports that it has a network device it expects on a certain pcie port, then that gets assigned an onboard number
<sudokode>	does it have to be pcie?
<sudokode>	my board's older, so it's likely the ethernet is on pci
<aremis117>	!ix
<phrik>	curl -f 'f:1=<-' ix.io
<aremis117>	hey i have a problem in xorg.  http://ix.io/ifw  the nvidia module doesn't load.  how do i load individual modules again?
<crazedpsyc>	aremis117: what does dmesg say about that error?
<howdoitype>	does #archlinux-offtopic not exist?
<crazedpsyc>	it sure does
<howdoitype>	apparently i'm banned. o.o i've never even been there.
<crazedpsyc>	it requires freenode registration
<howdoitype>	i am registered

<howdoitype>	"[21:58] == #archlinux-offtopic cannot join channel (+b) - you are banned"
<crazedpsyc>	oh. well then *shrug*
<teraflop>	then youre banned? :p
<beest>	aremis117: it's already trying to load the module, do you have the right driver?
<howdoitype>	it's weird because the first time i even heard of that channel was 2 minutes ago. xd
<aremis117>	beest:  i got the nvidia-304xx driver
<beest>	howdoitype: someone probably banned the whole webclient
<howdoitype>	ahh.
<crazedpsyc>	aremis117: do you have nouveau blacklisted?
<beest>	aremis117: is that the right driver?
<aremis117>	crazedpsyc:  don't you have to have nouveau installed in the first place to have that be an issue
<aremis117>	?'
<demonicmaniac3>	aremis117: no
<crazedpsyc>	you do have nouveau installed
<crazedpsyc>	it's part of linux
<demonicmaniac3>	the nouveau module sits in the kernel
<aremis117>	beest:  yes the 340 driver works with my card
<aremis117>	ah
<aremis117>	that's probably it then
<beest>	the nvidia pkgbuilds add a nouveau blacklist but who knows
<beest>	aremis117: aha, you're sure you installed 304 instead of 340?
<beest>	[  3016.785] (ii) nvidia dlloader x driver  340.76  thu jan 22 11:03:05 pst 2015

<aremis117>	oh well :p
<beest>	don't confuse me this early in the afternoon
<aremis117>	i blacklisted nouveau @ /etc/modprobe.d/nouveau_blacklist.conf but it still fails to start
<tom^>	aremis117: pacman -qs nvidia
<beest>	yeah, the package should be doing that for you already anyway
<aremis117>	beest: if it blacklists it in the first place then how should i go about fixing this xd it's a fresh install
<beest>	while you're at it, lspci | grep vga
<tom^>	aremis117: pacman -qs nvidia
<aremis117>	beest:  "vga compatible controller: nvidia corp gt215 [gt330] (rev 2)
<beest>	actually nevermind, i just looked at your dmesg
<aremis117>	tom^:  yes ok it lists 3 packages
<tom^>	aremis117: yes and which?
<tom^>	aremis117: that old card needs  nvidia-304xx anyways.
<aremis117>	tom^:  nvidia-340xx libcl and nvidia-340xx-utils
<tom^>	340xx
<tom^>	i meant
<tom^>	aremis117: nvidia-340xx-libgl
<aremis117>	i have used 340 with it and it preformed better.
<aremis117>	whatever then
<tom^>	wat
<aremis117>	yes
<beest>	yeah, it thinks nouveau is loaded when it isn't, i'm officially stumped
<tom^>	are you skipping 2/3 of what im writing? :p
<aremis117>	tom^:  no :p i'm installing 304 instead as you advise :p
<tom^>	tom^ | 340xx
<beest>	no, you're skipping 2/3 of what he's writing :p
<tom^>	tom^ | i meant
<beest>	or maybe closer to 1/3.
<aremis117>	ah
<aremis117>	maybe i'm just blind
<aremis117>	:p
<aremis117>	ok now my brain is stuck.  use 340 or not
<beest>	use 340
<aremis117>	i'm too dead in the head for this crap today xdd
<beest>	and install nvidia-340xx-libgl
<beest>	although i don't think that's gonna help, but you need it anyway
<aremis117>	will do
<ruukasu>	even though i'm in urxvt and my $term is rxvt-unicode-256color, lots of unicode characters show up as ?
<ruukasu>	how can i fix that?
<holomorph>	configuring fallback fonts for urxvt, or using a terminal emulator that doesn't suck with fonts so much
<namarrgon>	have you set up the locale?
<aremis117>	here goes nothing
<holomorph>	or that
<beest>	!give ruukasu chklocale
<phrik>	ruukasu: diagnose locale issues by running the following bash script: <http://git.io/q_henq>
<aremis117>	thakn you both beest and tom^
<beest>	is it working?
<howdoitype>	i'm making a 150gb file server, let's see how this works out
<ruukasu>	beest: i think uncommented a locale in locale.gen and ran locale-gen when i was installing, but for some reason my locale is "c"
<beest>	ruukasu: did you also set your locale in locale.conf?
<aremis117>	beest:  yes it looked like it wasn't going to but it went through
<beest>	aremis117: i'm kinda surprised, if you were just missing libgl i would have expected it to fail much later than that, tom was the one with the catch
<howdoitype>	do i need anything from base-devel if i'm only setting up a file server?
<beest>	i wouldn't expect to
<beest>	well, at least not the whole group
<aremis117>	beest:  i have very wierd hardware come in every once in a while
<ruukasu>	beest: ah, i seem to have forgotten that
<ruukasu>	thanks
<ponyrider>	hey guys where can i change the font for the terminal when i am not running xorg
<ruukasu>	weird, how i'm getting "you are using the en_us.utf-8 locale." and "shell's locale matches terminal's locale.", and some unicode seems to work, but i still get ? in place of vertical and horizontal bars in weechat
<ruukasu>	(after reboot)
<howdoitype>	is there a cli-based battery indicator in the official repos?
<howdoitype>	i'd rather not get a gui just to see if i'm low on battery
<hazuki>	hello world. i'm trying to install ndiswrapper from aur at https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ndiswrapper/ and running into the problem the top poster mentioned (needs linux 3.18 or 3.19 and i have 4).
<phrik>	title: aur (en) - ndiswrapper (at aur.archlinux.org)
<hazuki>	i don't understand what to do here
<hazuki>	do i add those 4 lines to the pkgbuild, add the next 4 to the .patch, and add the last one to .install?
<namarrgon>	ruukasu: post the output of the script to a paste-service
<howdoitype>	hazuki: add everything but the last one to the pkgbuild
<hazuki>	howdoitype: okay, will try that :)
<ruukasu>	namarrgon: http://termbin.com/z9sa
<namarrgon>	ruukasu: have you installed any fonts? do you have some other terminal installed?
<ruukasu>	namarrgon: i have dejavu installed, and that has pretty much every character there is, right?
<namarrgon>	no, certainly not every character but it should have enough box-drawing characters for weechat
<namarrgon>	unless you failed to set the font properly
<hazuki>	howdoitype: thanks, this compiled successfully :)
<howdoitype>	hazuki: no problem. :)

<clarjon1>	howdy, tigrmesh
<hazuki>	you can get 120gb-class ones for <$60 us at some places like best buy
<tigrmesh>	debian stable?
<qgel>	i'm trying to compile youcompleteme from source, but cmake complains that it can't find python development files. i come from debian (where i would install python-dev) but i read that arch already includes dev headers with the main package. is there anything else i need to do so cmake finds the headers?
<clarjon1>	tigrmesh: it was unstable, then they pushed a release, now i'm not sure what i'm running exactly -- all i know is that packages are starting to break no matter what i do, meaning it's about time for a reinstall anyways.
<namarrgon>	qgel: you should know that on arch 'python' is python3
<tigrmesh>	i've read that when a release happens, the freeze ends, and there are a flood of packages that have been waiting
<tigrmesh>	to move
<lyonsb>	like ten thousand weasels attempting to move through one toilet paper tube at once.
<hazuki>	clarjon1: debian 8 ("jessie") also ships with systemd, so i'd advise a fresh install rather than a dist-upgrade
<hazuki>	as things are going to break (tm)
<qgel>	namarrgon i have python2 and python3 installed. the cmake script requires 2.6 or 2.7, so it should (ideally) find the correct installed version, no?
<namarrgon>	qgel: is there no aur package for it or why are you building from source?
<tigrmesh>	clarjon1, so you're used to the rolling release model.  that's good.  it can be quite an adjustment
<clarjon1>	tigrmesh: i prefer rolling release.
<beest>	qgel: also youcompleteme has a git aur package that could save you a lot of trouble https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vim-youcompleteme-git/
<phrik>	title: aur (en) - vim-youcompleteme-git (at aur.archlinux.org)
<qgel>	namarrgon there is an aur package, but it exibits the same problem for me
<tigrmesh>	me too
<ruukasu>	qgel: it is probably expecting /usr/bin/python to be python2 as it is on 95% of systems
<beest>	also i'm exactly a half minute behind namarrgon
<clarjon1>	hazuki: i think i was on "sid" and i switched over to systemd manually.
<clarjon1>	right now, the ssl libs are causing such a pain.
<hazuki>	eep...
<clarjon1>	if i try to update 'em, they get marked as broken. if i try to fix that, it uninstalls all of kde.
<beest>	qgel: do you have the base-devel group installed?
<hazuki>	what happens if you uninstall all of kde, update them, and reimnstall kde?
<clarjon1>	hazuki: i'd rather switch to arch, as i'll have to be reinstalling kde anywho. :)
<qgel>	beest yes
<hazuki>	clarjon1: lol, fair enough :)
<beest>	i'm building ycm now, we'll see what breaks
<namarrgon>	qgel: can you post the full build output?
<qgel>	nmarrgon what the console prints? or is there a special log file?
<howdoitype>	i like how quickly arch installs. c:
<namarrgon>	qgel: either will do

<tom^>	!give clarjon1 wiki install guide
<phrik>	clarjon1: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide
<clarjon1>	yup, i'm reading that over.
<tom^>	clarjon1: if its not enough there is the beginners guide but its horrible.
<clarjon1>	i've just been pampered by gui installers all my linux life, heh.
<namarrgon>	qgel: add "-dpython_include_dir=/usr/include/python2.7 -dpython_library=/usr/lib/libpython2.7.so" to the cmake call
<namarrgon>	qgel: you should switch to the aur pkgbuild btw
<beest>	and that's weird because it builds fine for me without it
<beest>	oh, he's not using the pkgbuild
<clarjon1>	i can skip some of the steps, such as partitioning, as i already have my partition tables setup how i want 'em
<namarrgon>	beest: do you have python and python2 installed?
<beest>	yup
<clarjon1>	sooo, backup my current fstab, and copy it over to my other running machine so i can use it as a reference...
<qgel>	namarrgon what do you mean by aur pkgbuild? i can't find a package by that name.
<pessimist>	!pkgbuild
<namarrgon>	!aursearch youcompleteme
<phrik>	searching aur packages... https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?k=youcompleteme
<namarrgon>	qgel: ^
<beest>	i can confirm it builds from that pkgbuild
<qgel>	i was using that in my log im pretty sure
<namarrgon>	i just assume it doesn't fail because of his broken locale
<amoushamara>	hi, i'm trying to use pam_mount, i edited system-auth as described in the wiki under pam_mount, but it's not working for me, it's as if pam_mount doesn't get the password. any idea what could be wrong?
<beest>	yeah, i'm not sure why it would fail to find python from a busted locale but my cmake voodoo is weak
<namarrgon>	beest: can you break your locale and try again? :p
<beest>	i was considering it!
<namarrgon>	qgel: locale -a
<qgel>	sorry i'm a bit confused now. to build something from aur i just download, extract and run makepkg, correct? because thats what i was doing
<mjuad>	i'm having an issue getting urxvt to use true transparency
<luminarys>	you using compton mjuad?
<namarrgon>	qgel: pretty much, yes. you should take a look at the pkgbuild and .install scripts first though.
<mjuad>	if i use the command line urxvt -depth 32 -bg rgba:1111/1111/1111/dddd it works fine
<mjuad>	but when i put the stuff in ~/.xdefaults or ~/.xresources and use xrdb -merge it doesn't do anything
<mjuad>	i'm using xfwm
<tom^>	does xfwm have a compositor?
<mjuad>	yes
<mjuad>	can set transparencies for moving windows, background windows, shadows for windows, etc.
<mjuad>	and like i said it works fine when i use the command line to initiate urxvt
<qgel>	namarrgon ok, it works if i add the flags to the cmake call
<luminarys>	and xrdb -merge doesn't register updates for the urxvt transparency, or any updates in general?
<tom^>	mjuad: oh missed that.
<mjuad>	just not when i add it to the .xresources or .xdefaults files
<namarrgon>	qgel: locale -a
<howdoitype>	i'm unable to ssh into my laptop .-. i must be doing it wrong
<luminarys>	probably howdoitype
<luminarys>	is the laptop on your local network?
<howdoitype>	yes.
<beest>	do you know how to type?
<luminarys>	alright and you know the ip address?
<howdoitype>	yes.
<luminarys>	ok do ssh -vv user@laptopip
<mjuad>	luminarys: it doesn't say anything, no
<beest>	does the laptop have sshd installed?
<mjuad>	just some stuff about overrides for some keybindings
<beest>	and running?
<howdoitype>	beest: yes, i installed and configured sshd on the laptop
<howdoitype>	and enabled+started the daemon
<mjuad>	i mean i know i can just set up an alias to use the command line for when i start urxvt but i'd like to figure out why it's not working when it's in the config file
<tom^>	mjuad: well what are you adding to the xdefault/xresource file?
<mjuad>	urxvt*depth: 32
<howdoitype>	oh it worked, luminarys
<howdoitype>	thanks
<mjuad>	urxvt*background: rgba:1111/1111/1111/dddd
<luminarys>	i don't think i did anything
<luminarys>	but if it works it works
<luminarys>	probably a minor typo on your part
<howdoitype>	i actually used the method the wiki suggested and that didn't work
<nuc1eon>	hi, can an onboard soundcard be destroyed by software?
<tom^>	mjuad: urxvt.depth: 32  too
<luminarys>	also if you did do what i typed, don't include the -vv from now on
<tom^>	mjuad: oh nvm
<mjuad>	i have that
<luminarys>	it's a verbose option
<tom^>	mjuad: i should sleep haha, missing lines.
<mjuad>	np, i typed them manually
<mjuad>	so they didn't show together
<qgel>	namarrgon it really looks like it was the locale. i set a correct one (i hope, en_us.utf8) and now it works without the flags.
<qgel>	thanks a lot!
<beest>	!give nuc1eon xy
<phrik>	nuc1eon: what exactly are you trying to do? http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
<mjuad>	is there any difference between urxvt* and urxvt. ?
<mjuad>	i've also seen urxvt*.
<nuc1eon>	i am trying to find out why my soundcard is dead
<hongouru>	how can i change the keyboard type??
<d_garbage>	qgel, just a tip: next time you see a log and things are screaming about a problem, like your locale, maybe check your locale? }:]
<hongouru>	i did loadkeys es but nothing happened
<howdoitype>	hongouru: did it not give you any output?
<hongouru>	i installed i3-wm and it changed my keyboar type
<hongouru>	as sudo no
<howdoitype>	nomrally if loadkeys gives no output, it works
<howdoitype>	normally*
<namarrgon>	qgel: that's just broken
<nuc1eon>	so, do you guys think that software can physically damage a soundcard?
<namarrgon>	qgel: you could report it if you care enough
<hongouru>	nuc1eon, yes...
<tom^>	nuc1eon: in theory sure.
<nuc1eon>	hm, thats interesting
<mrelendig>	hongouru: loadkeys is not for x
<qgel>	namarrgon looks like i was wrong about that actually. i think it just worked because it diddnt build everything again (i just ran makepkg with -f)
<mjuad>	nm got it working, i think it's becuase my xresources file had some issues so it wasn't doing the merge at all
<mrelendig>	hongouru: setxkbmap on the other hand...
<nuc1eon>	well looks like i need to buy a new one then
<qgel>	if i start completely from scratch, it still doesnt work
<mjuad>	i put it in ~/.xdefaults and merged that and it worked fine
<namarrgon>	qgel: do you still get the locale warnings?
<tom^>	nuc1eon: 1. i doubt that. 2. you havent really telled us why you think its dead.
<beest>	nuc1eon: in practice it's extremely unlikely, what software do you suspect of killing your soundcard and why?
<hongouru>	mrelendig, thank you !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<hongouru>	persist changes?
<tom^>	hongouru: nop
<hongouru>	how do i make it persist ?
<mrelendig>	add it to whatever autostart your wm has
<vimal2012>	i have successfully installed plasma and sddm. i got a working desktop.  but where are my applications like (kate, konsole, dolphin)? what package should i install?
<mrelendig>	pkgfile
<d_garbage>	meh, i got all excited because gpodder3 had an update an i imagined it was a fix for the new youtube api. turns out it was just a rebuild. there's a couple of bugs on the tracker that haven't been looked at yet, project seems dead. shame it's a nice little program.
<mrelendig>	!wiki kde packages

<nuc1eon>	beest, i have had some trouble with my new kernel, it didnt boot correctly. so i took time to fix it and now i dont have any sound
<nuc1eon>	i have no idea why
<mrelendig>	pacman -ss is also usefull
<mrelendig>	-l
<nuc1eon>	i mean the soundoutput isphysically dead
<j0hw0lf>	hi
<nuc1eon>	i tried it on widnows even
<mrelendig>	nuc1eon: not in lspci?
<nuc1eon>	just yesterday it still worked
<j0hw0lf>	my problem
<j0hw0lf>	help
<nuc1eon>	it is getting recognised
<tom^>	john_f: no.

<tom^>	j0hw0lf: no.
<hongouru>	tom^, how do i make it persist ?
<nuc1eon>	i know it soudns weird
<j0hw0lf>	git connect github problem
<nuc1eon>	wouldnt believe if it didnt happen to me :p

<j0hw0lf>	command ssh -t gitgub.com wait
<hongouru>	ok
<vimal2012>	pacman -s kde
<hongouru>	for i3 ?
<vimal2012>	does not work
<nuc1eon>	also i am using oss instead of alsa, maybe oss managed to kill it by some strange bug/misbehaviour
<d_garbage>	you probably don't need or want all of kde anyway
<beest>	and there's no group named kde
<d_garbage>	!give vimal2012 wiki kde
<phrik>	vimal2012: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/kde
<tom^>	nuc1eon: why use dead old obsolete oss?
<rrooij>	hey, i have a question about aur maintanence. if the version number of a package changed formats, should pkgrel be incremented by 1?
<tom^>	nuc1eon: get alsa and i bet it simply just works.
<jushur>	omg hadent noticed the speed improvement in zfs modules since last update, impressive. gona asume there was a very bad performance bug before.
<d_garbage>	things will be a lot easier when kdebase4 gets dropped, even if things aren't 100% done by then
<mrelendig>	rrooij: no
<qgel>	namarrgon:  yes, setlocale lc_all: cannot change locale (en_us.utf8)
<namarrgon>	qgel: locale -a
<d_garbage>	poor kde wiki page has a split personality
<mrelendig>	rrooij: pkgrel should be bumped if you have a changed pkgbuild for the same version
<j0hw0lf>	debug log http://ix.io/ify
<rrooij>	mrelendig: clear. also, nice nickname by the way.
<qgel>	namarrgon:  i don't understand how that helps me. it prints : c, en_us.utf-8 posix
<namarrgon>	qgel: 'locale'
<tom^>	rrooij: its misspelled, supposed to be mrevil
<nuc1eon>	tom^, dunno it always worked for me. but still i mean it's physically dead. the soundcard gets recognized and i even see the mixer showing soundoutput, but it does not work. as i said even on windows...
<d_garbage>	rrooij, he used to be mr happy before helping here }:]
<nuc1eon>	so if it works on windows it must be the hardware

<phrik>	mrelendig: tada!
<beest>	his nick is a misnomer, he's always fucking cheerful
<tom^>	nuc1eon: oh i still think you are stupid.
<tom^>	i still will help you up to a certain point :p
<qgel>	namarrgon: not that i'm aware of. i ran 'locale-gen' and 'localectl set-locale lang=en_us.utf-8 '
<d_garbage>	!chklocale
<phrik>	diagnose locale issues by running the following bash script: <http://git.io/q_henq>
<nuc1eon>	well i dont need actual help since i'm not able to repair a broken soundcard, but still i was curious to see if you think if a soundcard can be damaged by software (be it by the kernel, or buggy sound systems)
<beest>	it is so unlikely as to be inconsequential
<tom^>	^
<beest>	to the point where i'd eat my shoe if it actually happened
<d_garbage>	interesting, google translates 'happy' as 'glad' which is a fine old english word
<tom^>	i wouldnt believe it even if i so saw it with my own eyes
<grawity>	nuc1eon: possible in some cases (see e.g. "killer poke")
<grawity>	nuc1eon: but really not that common
<tom^>	d_garbage: or the swedish word for happy
<beest>	not on modern hardware
<tom^>	d_garbage: :>
<d_garbage>	seems to have germanic roots
<namarrgon>	qgel: can you log in with a different user on a vt and see what 'locale' returns there?
<beest>	this isn't like telling a vic to sync out of spec
<grawity>	beest: well that's how i blew up my crt in 2003
<d_garbage>	yeah wsa just thinking that
<beest>	yup, crts are another story :p
<grawity>	i remember a few years ago there was a story about a cd drive using the "are you a cd drive" command for firmware upgrades
<grawity>	so windows somehow worked, but linux would brick it
<beest>	and there are actually a handful of digital displays that can be bricked
<grawity>	and, well, there was that thing from 2013 about lenovo uefi variable brickage
<grawity>	two stories, even
<d_garbage>	didn't the kernel break some network cards a while back?
<tom^>	the rt8189 or whatever the module now is called could lock it in a state where you had to unplug cable and make sure its powerless before it would be able to be used again.
<junka>	bad, bad kernel
<tom^>	but it didnt break it :p
<d_garbage>	ah
<nuc1eon>	grawity, thanks that really helpful and might help me to understand what happened. well in the end there's only two possibilities: either it got damaged by a "killer poke", or it just randomly died.
<d_garbage>	things do die occasionally
<beest>	but unless you, i dunno, somehow put a dsp in a loop and fry it or something really bizarre, you're not gonna kill a sound card in software
<beest>	granted, most consumer sound hardware is shit
<howdoitype>	is there a cli-based battery indicator in the official repos?
<grawity>	htop and `acpi` can report battery status
<beest>	i did kill a pro tools card once but that was my own fault :p
<selby>	am i here?
<tom^>	selby: nope

<qgel>	namarrgon: switching to a tty and logging in as root prints the same thing as before, except that it now says 'lc_all=' at the bottom

<selby>	tom^:  i don't know.  web browser is working fine
<selby>	as is irc apparently
<kaligne>	hi i am about to install x. i have a nvidia card. which driver should i pick? nouveau or proprietary  nvidia driver? output from `lspci` command is here in case: http://sprunge.us/jced
<eleventh>	selby maybe iptabels?
<tom^>	kaligne: nouveau will not be pleasent on that card.
<namarrgon>	qgel: which de/wm and terminal are you using for building?
<tom^>	kaligne: so there is really just one choice.
<selby>	eleventh: no rules
<tom^>	kaligne: however isnt this a optimus laptop ?
<qgel>	namarrgon: kde/plasma/konsole
<beest>	nuc1eon: shorted the expansion chassis with a roy rogers
<grawity>	selby: ls -l /etc/resolv.conf
<tom^>	kaligne: which means the monitor is actually hardwired to the intel gpu, and you will need bumblebee or similiar to use the nvidia card.
<namarrgon>	qgel: and if you log in as that user on vt?
<selby>	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 32 apr  8 15:09 /etc/resolv.conf -> /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf
<pid1>	kaligne, is that a desktop or an optimus laptop?
<kaligne>	tom^ pid1 : it is an acer inspiron laptop
<nuc1eon>	beest, heh well thats a deadly combo^^
<pid1>	kaligne, so optimus.
<selby>	well, restarting networkd and resolved fixed it
<pid1>	!give kaligne wiki optimus

<beest>	ah, demize did it, musta been a troll zinger
<linoge>	holy christ
<namarrgon>	qgel: yeah, lc_ctype=c is not right. does this also happen if you log in with that user on a vt?
<beest>	linoge: costs more than that most places these days
<beest>	and in new york expect to sell a kidney
<qgel>	namarrgon: yes
<pid1>	tom^ that's cheap. they're about $8.50 where i live.
<teraflop>	lol
<tom^>	beest: if not its gonna be stolen
<d_garbage>	get a vape, much cheaper and more practical :)
<namarrgon>	qgel: create a new user, log in and see if you get the same there
<pid1>	maybe if you buy in bulk they're cheaper.
<linoge>	hell, i was told that selling burgers in mcdonald you get about 1500$ a month?
<d_garbage>	all the nicotine you could ever want and no mess
<beest>	d_garbage: speak for yourself, i just changed a coil and am covered in goo

<clarjon>	so, as i said earlier, installing arch. i'm up to the point where i have to generate grub, and i'm confused.
<grawity>	basically the steam-runtime ships libraries that no longer work with arch's libgl
<ph0x>	how so
<namarrgon>	qgel: "grep -r lc_ctype ~" logged in with the broken user
<kaligne>	ok before going any further, can you tell me why i would be better off chosing bumblebee instead of nvidia driver? reading the wiki page didn't give me a clue (tom^ pid1)
<clarjon>	first time really installing grub from scratch, don't want to mess things up.
<grawity>	aremis117: http://ix.io/ifz
<ph0x>	is it a dual boot system clarjon
<clarjon>	no.
<ph0x>	should be straight forward
<ph0x>	dont worry about breaking it if it fouls up ill help you chroot in and fix it
<rkreis_>	kaligne, you need it to use optirun/primusrun
<clarjon>	alrighty. i'll just run the commands from the wiki then -- my only concern is that it says i386 whilst this is an x86_64 install.
<ph0x>	its fine
<clarjon>	that's why i came here, to double check. thanks :)
<ph0x>	86_64 can run 386
<ph0x>	thats hwy its called 86_64
<kaligne>	i read about switching between graphical cards. does it mean i have an internal graphical card, plus a nvidia one? (sorry for the dumb questions, that's a whole new world to me (
<clarjon>	oh. looks like i have to learn the package manager, heh.
<grawity>	clarjon: for bootloaders that's fine - x86_64 cpus always start in x86 mode first
<qgel>	namarrgon: ok, looks like i actually set lc_ctype=c in my .zshrc ,,, not sure why, to be honest
<aremis117>	grawity i have a command for that stuff already.  find ~/.steam/root/ \( -name "libgcc_s.so*" -o -name "libstdc++.so*" -o -name "libxcb.so*" \) -print -delete  and i add it to the run file to patch it up but it still doesn't work
<namarrgon>	qgel: remove it, re-login
<aremis117>	i'll have to dig into it later i guess
<howdoitype>	i honestly didn't think it'd be this easy to set up a fileserver
<aremis117>	it's not that hard tbh
<howdoitype>	i'm a first timer and it took less than an hour
<howdoitype>	including the installation of arch ^
<qgel>	namarrgon: http://lpaste.net/1549712577938849792 . thanks for all the help by the way..
<phrik>	title: no title :: lpaste — lambda pastebin (at lpaste.net)
<aremis117>	howdoitype:  install is done in 7 commands and then the rest is done in a flash
<cirrus_minor>	lighttpd is simple to set up imo
<namarrgon>	qgel: that should fix the warnings but does it still not find python?
<qgel>	namarrgon: it's still the same, including the warning
<clarjon>	alrighty, let's see if this is working...
<clarjon>	and i have a login! nice.
<howdoitype>	now to set up a static ip for my laptop so i don't have to manually check everytime i want to ssh into it
<clarjon>	oh. huh. wifi-menu didn't have it's dependencies installed. not fun.
<howdoitype>	clarjon: that has happened to me way too many times.
<aremis117>	ok i really don't know what the issue is here.  i delete the files left over in the steam stuff and try to start it but it still freezes at the breakpad handler dingus...
<namarrgon>	qgel: you still get the locale warnings?
<aremis117>	clarjon
<pandb>	i can't seem to interact with bluetooth and i don't know where to start
<aremis117>	you should chroot while in the cd session
<clarjon>	yes.
<clarjon>	i was out of the cd session, so now i'm rebooting into the cd session again.
<pandb>	i get "no default controller avaiable" when i enter the command `power on` in bluetoothctl
<aremis117>	!give pandb wiki bluetooth
<phrik>	pandb: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/bluetooth
<pandb>	phrik i've already been there
<d_garbage>	!give pandb source
<phrik>	pandb: my source is at https://github.com/progval/limnoria
<ph0x>	clarjon: we were all new once
<peregrine`>	hi, i have installed taglib which is supposed to have bindings for perl, but perl/i can’t find them.  is it a known issue?  (i am new to perl and its module system, might have skipped an important step.)
<clarjon>	mhm :)
<teraflop>	hey i run the same supybot!
<clarjon>	is there a page with a list of recommended packages to install? base install doesn't even come with ifconfig it seems...
<qgel>	namarrgon: ok, looks like it was just because the folder still had stuff from before in it. everything works now if i start from scratch, thanks again
<teraflop>	clarjon: btw you missed dialog package?
<spareproject>	clarjon: ip help
<clarjon>	teraflop: the install guide didn't say i'd need the dialog package, i had followed it expecting a base system that i could just run wifi-menu and start installing what i needed
<ph0x>	i dont even know what ifconfig is but i feel like iv used it
<r4sp>	somebody using gnome? i'm having an issue with my arch. every time i launch a new gnome-terminal gnome freezes just a few seconds and then everything is normal. i just have this issue launching new terminals.
<teraflop>	clarjon: so yes? heh
<clarjon>	so, yes.
<teraflop>	heh
<ph0x>	youll need the dialog package for wifi-menu
<wyre>	someone uses kega fusion emulator? :p
<ph0x>	i suggest using ethernet till you get set up
<ph0x>	then yuo can c/p the key
<ph0x>	wifi key
<qgel>	namarrgon: sorry it took me so long to get. i feel like that could have gone somehwat faster :d
<namarrgon>	qgel: no problem. you can still report the broken buildsystem if you feel like it
<ph0x>	first time i set up arch
<ph0x>	i felt really annoyed
<d_garbage>	clarjon, the install guide does link to other sections, you need to follow those too
<ph0x>	like extremely
<d_garbage>	it's not 'additional' information it's part of the install
<ph0x>	but its not really so hard
<clarjon>	alrighty, i ended up being able to figure out how to get wifi working without a guide. :3
<cpnl>	i have a odd problem on both my desktop and laptop, using gnome and firefox with flashplugin and when i put any flash thing in fullscreen i can't click the exit fullscreen button, esc doesn't work either, only alt tab, any idea why that might be happening?
<qgel>	namarrgon: where would i report it? the aur package, or upstream to youcompleteme?
<namarrgon>	qgel: upstream
<cpnl>	same for volume etc, i get the gnome desktop options when i click there, if i click on the video itself it will pause though so not sure why that may be happening :/
<d_garbage>	qgel, makepkg has the -c and -c flags which can clean build area after building
<clarjon>	i am having fun. i had a lot of people tell me that arch wouldbe difficult, but it really isn't.
<clarjon>	that's what's most important for me in a linux distro. not how well it works, how often packages are updated -- how fun it is to problem solve :)
<aremis117>	clarjon:  good man
<cpnl>	other than the random quirk as long as you can read it's pretty straight forward :p
<rkreis_>	i agree that arch creates very few problems that don't already exist upstream
<clarjon>	and,  i have a perfect excuse to try out kde5 haha.
<d_garbage>	how difficult it is depends a lot on how much you already know/how quickly you learn things
<cpnl>	but yeah anyone else with the flash plugin issue? where anything like exiting fullscreen button or adjusting volume etc doesn't seem to work? bugging me and googling just brings random stuff that has nothing to do with it
<teraflop>	the crappiness of the flashplugin is legendary
<d_garbage>	also i imagine expectations play a part. if you thnik it's going to be really hard then that might make it seem easier and vice versa
<clarjon>	it should be pretty straightforward -- xorg's defaults tend to pick my hardware settings properly, as it's intel based hardware, so it -should- just work(tm)
<clarjon>	if not, not my first time wrangling xorg.conf, but it's been a long time since i've last had to.
<d_garbage>	also arch was a lot different when it started out back then it was much less smooth so got more of a reputation i guess
<cpnl>	biggest possible issue is not touching the install for a few months and having to figure out what's wrong when you update :p
<r4sp>	 teraflop hahahaha
<cpnl>	last time was around the time systemd was introduced, that was fun
<clarjon>	i've been enjoying systemd, i slapped it onto my last debian install.
<cpnl>	didn't touch the machine for like 4 months updated and fun times
<jushur>	use youtube-dl and mpv to watch videos instead, gives a lote better experience..
<cpnl>	yeah not for youtube, just other sites that use flash :( like twitch etc
<clarjon>	i use kodi on an android hdmi box for watching youtube on
<clarjon>	and for watching twitch :)
<cpnl>	well not twitch since i use livestreamer
<cpnl>	but for racing streams etc
<d_garbage>	if it's a channel i want to support, i use both
<teraflop>	cpnl: https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html
<cpnl>	never had that flash issue before but now it's on both machines with different video drivers so must be gnome or firefox i guess, but was hoping there was a fix
<phrik>	title: youtube-dl: supported sites (at rg3.github.io)
<d_garbage>	watch it in livestreamer and have the browser on mobile quality stream on the other workspace, so they can get the add revenue and i don't have to watch the adds
<closingin>	hi all. do someone know why i keep seeing "acpi: failed to switch the brightness" on my tty when i enable my hybrid graphics on the bios ?
<cpnl>	true i did that for games done quick
<closingin>	i've been looking on the wikis, did everything, but i do'nt find my answer
<closingin>	after a period of time, the computer crashes
<clarjon>	is there a chrome build for arch? or will i use chromium?
<cpnl>	there is on aur
<clarjon>	cool!
<grawity>	clarjon: the chrome build for arch is pretty much called chromium
<d_garbage>	clarjon, chromium
<clarjon>	i was aasking about chrome specifically, as that bundles with that pepper flash.
<grawity>	the only thing that gets called "chrome" is the binary directly from google
<cpnl>	but better off downloading chromium with pepper flash on aur too
<grawity>	if you want pepper-flash, use chromium and the aur pepper flash package
<d_garbage>	+1
<rgb-one>	hello
<cpnl>	hi
<d_garbage>	you have to install something else too, if you want to use netflix
<cpnl>	speaking of which i need to test pipelight flash to see if i still get that bug
<cpnl>	but then i'll get ugly fonts on flash muhaha
<clarjon>	grrr, it keeps booting me out of the user login :/
<cpnl>	uh :p
<clarjon>	there we go, just had to rename the old bash profile and bashrc files.
<kaligne>	i am about to install bunblebee with intel/nvidia. i am asked to choose between 4 providers for libgl: 1) mesa-libgl 2) nvidia-304xx-libgl  3) nvidia-340xx-libgl 4) nvidia-libgl. how do i know which one to pick? my gpu information are still here: http://sprunge.us/jced
<clarjon>	and now to figure out how to launch startx without being root...
<namarrgon>	!give clarjon wiki xinitrc
<phrik>	clarjon: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xinitrc
<clarjon>	oh, startx is in it's -own- package.
<mr423143>	hi
<thrice>	no, it's a part of the xinit package
<cpnl>	hi
<mr423143>	guys
<mr423143>	i have a question
<thrice>	!enter
<phrik>	stop hitting the enter key. can't you even type a full sentence?
<cpnl>	just ask don't ask to ask hehe
<halosghost>	phrik: give mr423143 ask
<phrik>	mr423143: don't ask to ask, if anyone is here or alive, or uses something. just ask, and we'll get moving along. thanks.
<halosghost>	❤
<jupelius>	!ask4
<phrik>	one day, after the apocalypse, somebody is going to find a computer with 3% battery remaining, logged in to #archlinux. they'll ask hello? is anybody alive in here? and the one other person still online will run !ask right before the battery dies.
<mr423143>	i installed archlinux arm on my raspberrypi. i've changed the locals, font and keyoboard to my locals (pl). reboot my raspberry pi. now when i clicking on a backspace or trying to click ctrl+x it is just showing question marks on the white background.
<qgel>	kaligne: i used mesa-libgl with a somewhat similiar hardware configuration (intel and nvidia graphics card)
<halosghost>	jupelius: lolyes
<halosghost>	mr423143: alarm != arch
<halosghost>	phrik: give mr423143 alarm
<phrik>	mr423143: if you're here because of an issue with your raspberry pi or other arm device, join #archlinux-arm.
<mr423143>	phrik: ok
<phrik>	ok!
<halosghost>	phrik: bot
<phrik>	i'm a bot! ~does the binary solo~ 00001 000011 0000111
<wasamasa>	!turing-test-passed
<halosghost>	phrik: are you a bot?
<phrik>	certainly true...
<halosghost>	wat
<halosghost>	oh, someone messed it up again
<halosghost>	phrik: "are you a bot?"
<phrik>	no, i'm just really smart and can type *very* fast
<kaligne>	qgel: what made you choose it?
<teraflop>	kaligne: read the bumblebee wiki
<d_garbage>	more like they'd ask, "has anyone here had an apocalypse? can someone help me with my survival problem?"
<halosghost>	d_garbage: heh
<qgel>	kaligne: i think the other options are only for when you are using the proprietary nvidia driver. as i wasn't going to use that all the time (ie when the dedicated card is diabled), i chose mesa-libgl
<kaligne>	teraflop: this wiki page does not tell me to choose between 4 providers. it says i will install mesa, but also nvidia. so making the asumption that i should go with mesa-libgl provider instead nvidia-*-libgl is quite unclear to me =)
<teraflop>	kaligne: that's true, my apologies
<mr423143>	guys nobody responding on #archlinux-arm do you know any other channel with arm linux support for newbies?
<teraflop>	kaligne: and yes i do bumblebee and i did mesa-libgl
<neuroserpens>	are there any gamers in this channel?
<neuroserpens>	i've been really missing farming gold for some real money lately and i haven't seen a linux game in which i can do that haha.
<neuroserpens>	xd
<clarjon>	bleh, kind of wish i hadn't selected the entire kde-applications section now, heh.
<clarjon>	oh well.
<kaligne>	teraflop: you are the second to write having gone with mesa-libgl. i guess i wont flip a coin then =)
<clarjon>	by the way, is there a gui frontend for pacman?
<witquicked>	mr423143, you have to be patient
<witquicked>	#archlinux-arm isn't as active as this channel
<mr423143>	witquicked: ok, someone responded :)
<mjuad>	google is your friend, there's a whole wiki page on pacman gui front ends
<clarjon>	awesome to hear. i'll look into that once i get my gui back up :)
<mjuad>	never seen a use for one myself, it just seems so much faster to type "pacman -s package"
<clarjon>	i like to browse what's available.
<mjuad>	fair point
<neuroserpens>	  ok noone likes games in this channel
<clarjon>	i like games, but my linux machine is not a gaming machine.
<mjuad>	what about games?
<neuroserpens>	neuroserpens | are there any gamers in this channel?                                                                                                                                                   │ ]oli[
<mjuad>	just reattached to my tmux session, did you have a question about them?
<neuroserpens>	18:51:03 neuroserpens | i've been really missing farming gold for some real money lately and i haven't seen a linux game in which i can do that haha.                                                           │ _404`d
<neuroserpens>	18:51:09 neuroserpens | xd
<clarjon>	and, i'm not a big fan of your types of games, neuroserpens.
<mjuad>	oh
<_404`d>	huh
<sublimate>	hey
<mjuad>	wine+your favorite mmo
<neuroserpens>	clarjon: noone said this is my type. i just said i've been missing doing that.
<sublimate>	i'm having trouble with launching vmware after a recent kernel update
<mjuad>	i've been having issues with vmware in general
<mjuad>	it seems to just destroy my resources and my machine isn't exactly lacking
<sublimate>	it is looking for version gcc version 5.1.0 and the latest arch version seems to be 4.9.2
<sublimate>	mjuad: same here...
<sublimate>	it makes xfce entirely unresponsive sometimes
<mjuad>	in windows or other (supported) flavors of linux i can run 5-6 vms at once and still do everything else i need
<mjuad>	seems to just make everything unresponsive in arch
<sublimate>	to be fair, i'm running a mac os x vm
<sublimate>	so it's not exactly supported :p
<sublimate>	mjuad: has it been launching fine for you with the newest kernel (if that's what you use)
<mjuad>	even running like xp vms kills my resources
<keenerd>	neuroserpens: linux has those games, but linux also has amazing farm bots.  they still need a really good amd video card.  i think it is called bitcoin or something.
<neuroserpens>	keenerd: lmao
<sublimate>	i'm getting a mac on monday
<sublimate>	installing arch will be a...fun thing
<mjuad>	i can't do the mac keyboard
<sublimate>	apparently the macbook one is good
<mjuad>	so many keys missing
<thrice>	their new touchpad is pretty cool
<mjuad>	there's some software i need for work where i have to have all of the keys
<mjuad>	for example insert
<mjuad>	which there doesn't seem to be a way to simulate on a mac
<sublimate>	thrice: mine won't have that unfortunately :(
<mjuad>	so i have a nice 15 pound hp elitebook with a full keyboard & nice screen
<sublimate>	i've been waiting but it looks like intel's way off of quad-core broadwells
<mjuad>	which i lug around the world
<sublimate>	so they're not gonna be coming out with a new mbp 15" soon
<sublimate>	so looks like i might have to install gcc from testing or something
<sublimate>	grr
<ph0x>	macs suck
<ph0x>	panasonic cf31 ftw
<sublimate>	good argument xd
<mjuad>	been thinking about doing some contributing to wine...what's the best way, just pick a bug on bugzilla and start hacking away at it?
<ph0x>	work on getting more of the google shit to work on linux
<ph0x>	ge works well but picasa doesnt
<thrice>	mjuad: how shoudl we know?  ask the wine guys
<ph0x>	cant detect usb cards i have to find it myself
<witquicked>	i've got a lenovo t540p and macbook pro sitting here in my office - i've gotta decide which one to use as my daily runner
<mjuad>	because it's probably a general question when it comes to contributing to any open source project
<ph0x>	and no matter how i try i cant log in to my google account
<sublimate>	mjuad: i figure so... wine seems to be a very high entry project in that it maintains/tries to emulate a lot of subtle windows behaviours and bugs
<mjuad>	and you know, considering that this channel is kinda geared towards that sort of thing, i figured people might have an idea
<mjuad>	fuck me for asking
<ph0x>	yeah
<clarjon1>	and i now have a working desktop. huzzah.
<ph0x>	fuck you
<sublimate>	mjuad: but with python core i know what you do is start by writing tests and stuff
<sublimate>	for patches in the beginner section
<ph0x>	clarjon1: now pass the install disc on
<sublimate>	then work up to fixing bugs
<ph0x>	and bless someone else
<thrice>	mjuad: sure, i guess.  buuuut given that the wine folks are available, seems like a better option to me
<thrice>	fuck me for suggesting
<mjuad>	thanks sublimate
<ph0x>	wine channel is ded
<ph0x>	most of the time
<cpnl>	lol
<sublimate>	kumbaya my lord... kumbaya...
<ph0x>	someones crying my lord
<ph0x>	kumbaya
<ph0x>	*looks around*
<ph0x>	i forget
<ph0x>	how do you search for packages you no longer need
<ph0x>	like libs and shit
<ongunkanat>	ph0x: pacman -qdt shows you orphaned packages
<ph0x>	is there a trick to outputting that to pacman -r
<ph0x>	pipe?
<d_garbage>	!wiki pacman tips
<phrik>	d_garbage: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman_tips
<d_garbage>	$() is handy
<d_garbage>	but be careful of auto-deleting stuff, it's better to double check
<d_garbage>	sometimes the dependency checks don't work as expected and you end up deleting stuff you want to keep
<earnestly>	d_garbage: pacman -qqtd | vipe | pacman -rs -
<d_garbage>	suppose thing a has thing b as a dep and b gets installed 'asdep' now you want to keep b but get rid of a, b will look like an orphan but you still want it
<earnestly>	d_garbage: if you want to check
<d_garbage>	nice :)
<braindamage>	!wtf vipe
<phrik>	braindamage: community/moreutils
<d_garbage>	sounds like a mixure of vi and pipe
<earnestly>	d_garbage: edit the commands output before passing it on to the next via vi/m yeah
<earnestly>	it's a pretty tiny perl script
<earnestly>	30 lines or so
<dropdrive>	hi, a newbie question.  my machine has 4gb ram, and at times, when i have too many tabs open or whatever, the machine basically becomes unresponsive for many minutes ... how might avoid that?
<aajjbb>	dropdrive: close a few tabs
<tomty89>	dropdrive: free -h
<tomty89>	or top *shrug*
<dropdrive>	tomty89: i was hoping for something like, well, if memory pressure is high, then offending processes get killed or whatever
<sublimate>	tried installing gcc 5.1.0, vmci still doesn't build
<d_garbage>	dropdrive, i have a visual monitor of cpu/ram/swap)/network usage on the panel, comes in handy for keeping an eye on things
<earnestly>	dropdrive: that's what it does do, oomkiller
<earnestly>	it just takes awhile sometimes
<earnestly>	dropdrive: there is still like 'earlyoom' which might help
<tomty89>	or perhaps it isn't your actual problem
<dropdrive>	d_garbage: which one do you use?
<sublimate>	any vmware users having trouble with kernel 4.0.1/vmci?
<sublimate>	i think i'm just gonna downgrade to -stable :p
<d_garbage>	dropdrive, i use kde so i have knemo for network and system monitor widget for cpu/ram
<earnestly>	grawity: http://www.projectmf.org/
<phrik>	title: project mf -- welcome page! (at www.projectmf.org)
<d_garbage>	dropdrive, but there are many such monitoring things available. conky for example can be used for that and is quite popular
<earnestly>	heh http://benlakey.com/2015/05/02/inquiring-minds-want-to-know/
<phrik>	title: inquiring minds want to know (at benlakey.com)
<dropdrive>	d_garbage: thanks, i'm on xfce so i guess conky
<d_garbage>	not sure how up to date it is bu there's a list of applicaitons on the wiki
<d_garbage>	!apps
<phrik>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/list_of_applications
<d_garbage>	but*
<brian_ch>	about dropdrive memory problem, that annoy me as well, i feel that swap just make things worse nowadays since once the os start writing to disk, there's no much hope it will comeback.
<earnestly>	c++ https://daniel-j-h.github.io/post/intuitive-monadic-bind-kleisli-composition/
<phrik>	title: an intuitive use-case for monadic bind and kleisli composition · daniel j. h. (at daniel-j-h.github.io)
<d_garbage>	not at all, doesn't work like that
<nuborn>	when swapping happens to me, i usually just close the application (sometimes from a tty) then "swapoff -a && swapon -a" to clear swap
<tomty89>	...
<brian_ch>	yes, i try to kill the application too, but sometimes i'm a little late and have to reboot
<sublimate>	who the eff built the kernel with a gcc that isn't in core yet
<d_garbage>	one thing i've noticed is that chromium eats ram for breakfast
<brian_ch>	but generally only happens when using vms or with gnash (alternative flash player)
<ph0x>	it sucks
<sublimate>	d_garbage: http://i.imgur.com/4lpvkts.gif
<d_garbage>	so you need to keep an eye on how many tabs you leave open
<ph0x>	vms eat ram too
<ph0x>	you need more ram
<ph0x>	its cheap now a days
<earnestly>	d_garbage: you know it's funny, but that it "eats ram for breakfast" really means almost nothing :d
<d_garbage>	sublimate, hehe
<earnestly>	it's like a phrase that has been so brutally disfigured that it sort of has its own weird meaning now
<earnestly>	"i eat punks like you for breakfast"
<brian_ch>	indeed, but ram is not that cheap here where i live
<sublimate>	i wish my school gave access to workstation 11
<sublimate>	hopefully we'll get it next academic year
<teraflop>	i've faced ram exhaustion importing huge pgsql databases for gis system i swear the server never recovers
<ph0x>	brian_ch: where do you live
<brian_ch>	brasil
<earnestly>	i've faced ram exhaustion building mlkit
<ph0x>	brian_ch: you can ship it to me
<sublimate>	gcc: now with colors.
<earnestly>	chromium is pretty light in comparison
<ph0x>	ill ship it to you
<teraflop>	!wtf mlkit
<phrik>	teraflop: what the hell is mlkit?
<sublimate>	looks like a compiler for ml
<earnestly>	teraflop: it's a region analysis compiler for ml, that basically converts programs to a stack memory allocation scheme instead of gc
<d_garbage>	!echo sublimate funny, i put it in a bang for you [chromium2]
<phrik>	sublimate funny, i put it in a bang for you http://i.imgur.com/4lpvkts.gif
<sublimate>	d_garbage: heh, nice!
<sublimate>	yay vmware modules finally compiled
<d_garbage>	no sure if sudokode's !chomium is still relevant so didn't delete it
<brian_ch>	ph0x: thanks, but fortunately i don't have to use vms so often. (and i gave up on gnash hehe)
<d_garbage>	seems to pass the test though now
<sublimate>	solution: install gcc from testing, downgrade to -lts, and use vmware-patch from aur
<sublimate>	such elegance, wow
<gusto>	hhi
<sublimate>	hi gusto :)
<earnestly>	your fault for using vmware
<gusto>	i just upgraded my beagle bone black and there is no ipv4 any more
<gusto>	what happened?
<sublimate>	earnestly: i need it :p
<gusto>	did arch move out of this netcfg?
<sublimate>	it's the only way i can run my mac vm
<maxwell>	all right, so i've tried everything on the kernel panic wiki page (which is actaully really old, interestingly), but trying to update to 4.1-rc1 from http://kernel.org is causing kps
<clarjon1>	hmph, now to reconfigure gtk to my liking...
<phrik>	title: the linux kernel archives (at kernel.org)
<maxwell>	http://u.xpo.pw/fow.jpg is a pic of it
<earnestly>	gusto: quite a long time ago, also arch doesn't support arm, you're in the wrong distro channell
<maxwell>	i've tried reducing like, everything new in the config
<gusto>	no, i have arch on my beaglebone black
<teraflop>	sublimate: forgive my ignorance, yo hae to do that because the vmware modules does not build against the latest core kernel?
<teraflop>	yo have*
<sublimate>	teraflop: yeah, vmware isn't very good at keeping their modules up to date
<sublimate>	i think they're still with like 3.14 or something
<kaligne>	i installed bumblebee  with intel/nvidia as described in the bumblebee wiki page. i added my user to the group bumblebee. i enabeld bumblebeed.service with systemctl. i rebooted. when i test optirun with the command `optirum glxgears -info` it says secondary gpu cannot be accessed. here is the output: http://sprunge.us/iapa. same occurs if i run `optirun glxspheres64`. what's going on here?
<pid1>	gusto: no, you have arch linux arm.
<sublimate>	vmware-patch is a good tool for it
<gusto>	archlinuxarm.org
<nizumzen>	gusto: no you don't - arch linux doesn't support arm - you are using an arch derivative
<maxwell>	!alarm
<phrik>	if you're here because of an issue with your raspberry pi or other arm device, join #archlinux-arm.
<pid1>	^
<gusto>	aha
<gusto>	ok
<teraflop>	holy cow i just use libvitd im on testing ^
<earnestly>	maxwell: unable to mount root fs
<maxwell>	yes, earnestly, yet booting with another kernel mounts the root fs fine
<earnestly>	maxwell: you might need to specify rootfstype=foobar on the kernel command-line, but this is a guess more than anything.
<maxwell>	hm, and what would i do if it was an encrypted root
<maxwell>	set it to the type of what's inside the container, or something like crypt
<earnestly>	nothing changes
<ph0x>	everything is always the same
<ph0x>	#philosophy
<ph0x>	dorry
<ph0x>	sorry
<ph0x>	couldnt help it
<maxwell>	wow spam
<maxwell>	earnestly: all rihgt
<ph0x>	carry on
<maxwell>	let's see what happens
<earnestly>	maxwell: it's a long shot
<maxwell>	who knows, maybe you'll be my savior
<yumbox>	is wayland useable yet?
<maxwell>	i'm so baffled as to a root fs not being able to mount is achieved via a new kernel version
<earnestly>	yumbox: "yes"
<earnestly>	maxwell: *shrug*, it is a bit odd
<maxwell>	didn't work
<earnestly>	but laptops
<aremis117>	!wiki uefi
<phrik>	aremis117: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/unified_extensible_firmware_interface
<yumbox>	earnestly: can i run gtk/qt/whatever programs on it?
<maxwell>	whois aremis117
<earnestly>	yumbox: mostly yes, some still require xwayland
<aremis117>	!wiki gummiboot
<earnestly>	yumbox: see orbment
<phrik>	aremis117: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/gummiboot
<maxwell>	lol, sorry, i was checking if you were another person with a similar nick
<earnestly>	yumbox: if you want a tiling "wm"
<yumbox>	earnestly: is that the closest i can get to i3 on wayland?
<earnestly>	yumbox: yes
<d_garbage>	maxwell, if you client has a server window, do your command in there then you never make mistake :)
<yumbox>	earnestly: okay, thanks.
<maxwell>	d_garbage: yeh, but switching to it takes work :(
<aremis117>	does anyone know of a command line only / verbose option for running steam?  i left it at the breakpad whatever 2 hours ago and nothing has happened
<d_garbage>	heh
<maxwell>	let's see now
<maxwell>	maybe 4.1-rc1 is just a dud or something?
<maxwell>	i mean, i doubt it
<earnestly>	maxwell: wait, 4.1-rc1?
<d_garbage>	already?
<maxwell>	yes, earnestly
<earnestly>	maxwell: where are you getting rc releases?
<maxwell>	kernel.org
<earnestly>	right...
<pid1>	hahaha
<brenix>	4.1-rc1 and nvidia don't play nice :(
<earnestly>	so i'm not even sure you're building it properly now
<maxwell>	earnestly: i'm using the pkgbuild from the linux-mainline aur package modified, so...
<earnestly>	4.0.1 is in core
<earnestly>	maxwell: so what?
<earnestly>	rc kernels, have fun.
<earnestly>	go report bugs if you want to use rc releases
<maxwell>	meh, [core] kernels
<earnestly>	what are you here for then?
<earnestly>	go report bugs upstream
<kaligne>	how can i even be sure i have a second gpu ? http://sprunge.us/ftdh
<earnestly>	kaligne: they're usually found in lspci
<bougyman>	well, can you count to 2?
<maxwell>	kaligne: look inside your computer
<maxwell>	are there 2
<earnestly>	it's a laptop
<maxwell>	look up your model number exactly / the configuration you ordered it with
<bougyman>	x-ray machine.
<earnestly>	or just lspci and see two gpu: entries
<maxwell>	unless it isn't found in lspci
<earnestly>	it will be
<bougyman>	doesn't optimus and the amd version of it hide one of the gpus?
<earnestly>	(in the case of optimus machines)
<earnestly>	no
<earnestly>	bougyman: the trouble is that the discrete gpu is not connected to the lvds, some people can get ordinary nvidia working if they exclusively use hdmi as those are usually connected to the discrete ;/
<kaligne>	it's a laptop indeed. there is a nvidia. there is also a vga compatible controller, not sure if that is the second though.. lspci: http://sprunge.us/zeda
<earnestly>	kaligne: you don't have optimus
<maxwell>	yes
<maxwell>	that is another gfx card
<earnestly>	it's not optimus though
<earnestly>	unless...
<kaligne>	how do you know? two other users told me i had optimus and i had to go with bumblebee
<bougyman>	it looks the same as an alienware i saw last week.
<bougyman>	which had optimus.
<earnestly>	interesting
<ph0x>	kaligne: you need to know
<ph0x>	not us
<kaligne>	haha alienware :)
<ph0x>	you are asking us
<earnestly>	i wonder if lspci's output has changed slightly since i last used it for this
<pid1>	earnestly, the nvidia card won't show up with lspci. mine doesn't either.
<earnestly>	kaligne: my condolences
<bougyman>	that's the only optimus i've ever had in front of me.
<ph0x>	you shouldnt take anyones word without some sort of proof
<earnestly>	pid1: it does, or used to.
<kaligne>	well i wish someone cold tell me how i can know it for sure :)
<earnestly>	pid1: it also should since it uses the pci subsystem
<bougyman>	what's the model number of the laptop?
<pid1>	must have been used to. it isn't showing up for me at the moment.
<earnestly>	pid1: unless your gpu uses usb or agp or something
<bougyman>	i can tell you for sure, with that info.
<ph0x>	kaligne: call the manufacture
<ph0x>	r
<pid1>	"call"
<pid1>	just check the product page on the dell website.
<earnestly>	it's alienware
<pid1>	^which is dell.
<ph0x>	i remember when alienware was good
<bougyman>	if it's alienware it's dell, and it's optimus.
<earnestly>	ph0x: you remember wrong
<ph0x>	earnestly: i know
<bougyman>	no, i remember when alienware was even _more_ overpriced.
<ph0x>	^
<bougyman>	i don't think the quality dropped much, but the prices did.
<ph0x>	it was a joke
<ph0x>	i bought one second hand once
<kaligne>	my laptop is an acer aspire v5-571g
<ph0x>	was just a normal amd64
<earnestly>	you have the professional laptops from dell which are meh, the consumer laptops which are hopeless and then the "gaming" laptops
<ph0x>	in a fancy shell
<pid1>	earnestly, never mind, i apologise. i'm just blind.
<pid1>	01:00.0 vga compatible controller: nvidia corporation gf108m [geforce gt 525m] (rev ff)
<bougyman>	kaligne: don't tell me you got the 'killer' network wifi?
<earnestly>	pid1: right, but see how it says "vga" and some say "3d controller"
<earnestly>	this is vaguely new to me
<bougyman>	that's why that friend brought his alienware over, trying to get the killer networks wifi working.
<pid1>	ah, ok.
<bougyman>	it's a lost cause.
<kaligne>	not sure, i had to install b43 driver
<bougyman>	absolutely doesn't work worth a crap in linux.
<earnestly>	bougyman: gaming stuff doesn't care for your standards
<bougyman>	b43 is broadcomm, no?
<earnestly>	they just bundle their own windows driver
<kaligne>	yes it is broadcom
<earnestly>	bougyman: mostly so they can led lights or something
<earnestly>	or contribute to buffer bloat
<bougyman>	everyone loves blinky lights.
<earnestly>	braindamage: you might have an answer to this; why do so many charges include leds which are extremely bright?
<earnestly>	is this some kind of design choice or just inherent somehow?
<clarjon1>	earnestly: because many people don't think something works if there isn't a bright light letting them know it's on.
<bougyman>	
<earnestly>	clarjon1: it doesn't have to be that bright
<earnestly>	clarjon1: almost no other form of light indicating the same thing on other devices are
<clarjon1>	earnestly: you'd be surprised -- i've had many people tell me that their charger is broken on day one because the led is dim.
<clarjon1>	earnestly: that kind of feedback goes back to the manufacturer eventually, they put in brighter leds to prevent confusion.
<bougyman>	we had a little red led on this driver fob we install on trucks.
<earnestly>	clarjon1: there are always going to be idiots, nothing will help that :p
<bougyman>	so the driver has to "fob-in" (touch his little keyfob to the magnet) so that the truck will start.
<earnestly>	but i wondered if there was some legitmate reason, like it being connected to the main
<bougyman>	the customers asked for a brighter led.
<bougyman>	"we can't see it in the daytime"
<earnestly>	well yeah, you can't see leds in day time without shielding
<bougyman>	right.
<bougyman>	it doesn't matter how bright we make it
<clarjon1>	i'm going to mod one of my chargers to have a light sensor. the more light the brighter the led will be.
<bougyman>	but they still all wanted it brighter.
<earnestly>	clarjon1: it won't be visible in light
<earnestly>	(lol solarroads)
<earnestly>	bougyman: just put a little shield over the top like traffic lights :p
<bougyman>	earnestly: it's usually mounted under the dash.
<earnestly>	wat
<bougyman>	near wherever the key goes.
<earnestly>	is it exposed to direct light at all then?
<kaligne>	so it appears my laptop has a nvidia optimus.
<earnestly>	kaligne: yes
<kaligne>	oh also, ther eis a sticker that says it
<bougyman>	earnestly: not normally
<kaligne>	am i going blind..
<earnestly>	bougyman: but can it be?  as in, sun light, not shining a torch directly on it
<bougyman>	the thing is, i don't think this thing even needs an led on it.
<bougyman>	if it didn't have an led at all, i doubt anyone would ask for one.
<kaligne>	which means, that isntalling bumblebee wasn't a mistake?
<bougyman>	https://www.geoforce.com/specialized-applications/driver-metrics drivers hate us.
<phrik>	title: geoforce - driver focused metrics (at www.geoforce.com)
<earnestly>	i can imagine
<teraflop>	kaligne: i do bumblebee but i do not have such issue, did you pick the proper nvidia version for your gpu?
<earnestly>	bougyman: every driver i've spoken to (or overheard) usually says they hate these things
<bougyman>	of course they do.
<earnestly>	:p
<earnestly>	some even hack them
<bougyman>	yeah they've cut the wire on our device quite a few times.
<aremis117>	hey beest you still there?
<bougyman>	then it starts alarming like crazy. an ultra-high pitched constant tone.
<bougyman>	they don't like that.
<earnestly>	bougyman: well, less crude hacks as well
<earnestly>	something something involving foil, i can't remember anymore :/
<kaligne>	teraflop: i installed bumblebee, mesa, xf86-video-intel and nvidia.  for libgl provider, i picked mesa-libgl in stead of any nvidia-*-libgl provider
<bougyman>	if they were good enough with bluetooth they could reprogram it over ble.
<bougyman>	the security on ble is just laughable.
<aremis117>	does anyone want to help take n a stupid thing steam is doing?
<bougyman>	wha?
<pid1>	aremis117, there's a forum thread linked in the steam wiki page that will fix your issue.
<aremis117>	pid1:  if you're thinking of the gcc thing i already did that
<earnestly>	gcc 5 is nice
<kaligne>	and, lspci -vnn says: kernel driver in use: nvidia;   kernel modules: nouveau, nvidia.
<bougyman>	it breaks a lot of things
<bougyman>	but of course all new gcc releases do.
<earnestly>	it breaks a lot of broken things
<earnestly>	people using implementation defined behaviour, for example
<kaligne>	maybe there is a conflict between nouveau and nvidia modules?
<aremis117>	bougyman:  how about not letting steam load past the very first breakpad?  does it do that?
<earnestly>	it's a shame there isn't a nice list of this for c, jpl's standards document redacts it for some reason
<pid1>	kaligne, that's your problem. you can't have nouveau and nvidia both installed.
<bougyman>	aremis117: no idea, steam works fine here.
<pid1>	remove nouveau
<bougyman>	the hnig of void plays steam, so it never breaks for long, here.
<bougyman>	hnic, that is.
<kaligne>	so that means both are installed, ok thanks
<aremis117>	kaligne:  blacklist nouveau.  you can't just eliminate it since it's in the kernel
<braindamage>	earnestly: no electromagnetical reason for the led, just indicators
<earnestly>	braindamage: but why so bright?
<earnestly>	braindamage: i.e. all other indicators are much dimmer
<earnestly>	like in monitors, laptops, tvs, etc.
<earnestly>	even the bios light in desktops
<braindamage>	generally because they recycle old designs and the led efficiency went up
<braindamage>	and they haven't adjusted
<earnestly>	would adjusting be less simple?
<earnestly>	e.g. adding resistors or something
<kaligne>	yes i can't uninstall nouveau via pacman. i will try to  blackmail it
<braindamage>	no, it's just a matter of tweaking a resistor typically
<earnestly>	i guess there's a resistor there already
<braindamage>	the resistor is already there, you just have to make it larger
<keenerd>	bougyman: you can see leds in the daytime.  every truck i've used for the last few years has had led taillights.  the backups were only a single led each.
<earnestly>	i see
<earnestly>	keenerd: but how?  i mean, you can't really see led strips in direct daylight, or i couldn't (it's slight)
<bougyman>	keenerd: lots of traffic lights moving to led, too.
<earnestly>	bougyman: traffic lights are shielded
<bougyman>	they're significantly brigers and very directional.
<earnestly>	to shade it
<bougyman>	*brighter.
<brian_ch>	also it's simpler to see if monitors, laptops, and tvs are working, so the led doesn't play this role in these devices.
<earnestly>	brian_ch: standby does
<braindamage>	leds are not limited to your low intensity status type
<earnestly>	keenerd: i assume it has something to do with the plastic red cup over it
<braindamage>	there's all sort of leds now from the faint to the _literally_ blinding
<earnestly>	hm
<braindamage>	i have an emitter that does 1klm
<earnestly>	braindamage: at what wattage?
<braindamage>	~15w
<brian_ch>	ah yes. but i assume they won't put a very bright led just because of that, it would distract attention from the image in the tv, monitor
<earnestly>	hmm
<braindamage>	it's a car headlight to get an idea of intensity
<earnestly>	brian_ch: i'm going to go with braindamage's theory :p
<earnestly>	braindamage: yeah, i know kind of what 1k lm is like, 15w is pretty damn good
<earnestly>	i thought it'd be higher
<braindamage>	iirc the ultimate limit would be around 600lm/w
<braindamage>	but that's monochromatic green light
<braindamage>	where the eye photopic response curve is at it's peak
<brian_ch>	earnestly: hehe ok :)
<sudokode>	light is always monochromatic
<earnestly>	brian_ch: but it's not bad either
<bougyman>	i want a super bright amber led.
<braindamage>	sudokode: except it's never is
<braindamage>	-'s
<sudokode>	well, you don't see it that way because you'
<sudokode>	re seeing light from multiple sources
<earnestly>	bougyman: you can buy leds to replace house lighting with them
<earnestly>	these days
<bougyman>	earnestly: i've done that.
<bougyman>	but they're all white.
<bougyman>	i want like 1969 terminal amber leds.
<sudokode>	for instance, you make a white led, you have to first make a blue led, then combine it with something to produce green and red
<sudokode>	constructively making white
<earnestly>	bougyman: yeah, you just have to get a lower colour temperature
<sudokode>	it's a fun game
<braindamage>	no, you can just do blue + yellow
<sudokode>	either way
<braindamage>	also
<bougyman>	yellow and blue make green.
<d_garbage>	and if you want you want to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe :p
<braindamage>	not with the correct weights
<earnestly>	sudokode: wait, but what about violet lights?
<sudokode>	it's hard to apply weights when you're using chemicals to produce light
<braindamage>	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/cie1931xy_blank.svg/2000px-cie1931xy_blank.svg.png
<sudokode>	earnestly: violet isn't real
<braindamage>	it's about intensity
<sudokode>	violet is just a deep shade of blue
<earnestly>	sudokode: it's a mixture of colour hues
<earnestly>	since it doesn't exist on its own, yeah
<braindamage>	take the baricenter of a colour combination and you get the resulting percieved colour from that space
<earnestly>	but that means it's not monochromatic
<sudokode>	when you pass over to uv, you get some leak into that "violet" light, which is just high frequency optical light
<braindamage>	also, there's no monochromatic source ever existing
<braindamage>	even the purest lasers have finite width
<earnestly>	braindamage: is that lab colours?
<braindamage>	it's the cie chromaticity diagram
<braindamage>	it's the result of an experiment on perception done on the 30s by comparing colours
<earnestly>	ah, it is
<sudokode>	braindamage: color is just the wavelength of light. it's pretty arbitrary
<earnestly>	braindamage: yeah, i call them "lab", i should call them cie
<sudokode>	and light from one specific source always has one specific wavelength
<earnestly>	or wait
<braindamage>	sudokode: utterly wrong
<sudokode>	braindamage: no it's not
<braindamage>	google: doppler broadening for instance
<earnestly>	no, i'm thinking of something else, sorry.  also thanks
<sudokode>	that's a moving source
<braindamage>	even static sources, as long as they last a finite amount, you're multiplying with a box in time
<sudokode>	and you're detecting from a stationary point. that's where you get red and blue shifting
<braindamage>	which is equivalent to convolving to a sinc in frequency domain
<braindamage>	which actually extends to infinity
<sudokode>	a frequency isn't a frequency if it doesn't remain the same
<sudokode>	to remain the same, it must have the same wavelength
<braindamage>	now you're just making things up
<sudokode>	uhhhh
<sudokode>	no
<sudokode>	wtf do you think a frequency is
<braindamage>	sorry, but you're over your head here, google fourier transform
<braindamage>	box function, and convolution
<earnestly>	ah, gate function
<braindamage>	the frequency is the frequency of sin and cos signals that form an orthogonal basis that you decompose signals to
<braindamage>	a monochromatic source is defined as a pure sine or pure cos, which is a pair of dirac deltas centered on the appropriate frequency
<sudokode>	right, and there's the exact reason why you have to mix frequencies in rf to produce binary data that can read by a receiver
<d_garbage>	anyone for apple pie?
<sudokode>	in other words, a single source of rf will not produce anything meaningful because it's the same frequency
<d_garbage>	sorry it took so long, i had to invent a universe
<braindamage>	again, you're over your head sorry, and since you're not acknowledging it, i'll just drop it now
<sudokode>	!shrug2
<phrik>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<sudokode>	if you're redefining frequency, we may all be in over our heads
<braindamage>	i'm not, it's just not a single frequency
<braindamage>	you have a mix of signals, not a single one
<sudokode>	right, because signals are mixed
<sudokode>	we're saying the same thing
<d_garbage>	often the case
<braindamage>	no, any signal of finite duration is not a single frequency
<braindamage>	easy as that
<sudokode>	right, which is why pulses don't work in rf either
<braindamage>	they work?
<sudokode>	and neither do constant single frequencies
<braindamage>	they work too
<braindamage>	but they don't exist
<earnestly>	braindamage: wait, why is -any- signal of finite duration not a single frequency?
<sudokode>	earnestly: correct
<sudokode>	because frequency has to be consistent forever ad infinitum
<earnestly>	braindamage: i mean, if i "generate" a sin wave, is it not a single frequency?
<sudokode>	otherwise it's not the same frequency
<braindamage>	sure, but a true sine wave extends from -inf to +inf
<kaligne>	i tried blacklisting nouveau by editing /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf. i put the following line: "install nouveau /usr/bin/false". lspci still tells me that nvidia kernel modules are nouveau and nvidia.
<d_garbage>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwkmhclkvog
<phrik>	title: r.e.m. - what's the frequency, kenneth? (official video) - youtube (at www.youtube.com)
<earnestly>	braindamage: oh, good point
<sudokode>	earnestly: if you don't include time, anything becomes a wave
<braindamage>	since it has a finite point in time it was born, and a finite point it time it'll die, it's not an actual sine wave
<earnestly>	braindamage: so what exactly about finitness makes it change over time?
<earnestly>	or, not a -single- frequency?
<earnestly>	braindamage: or is it simply by definition that unless it's infinate it's not a true sin wave?
<kaligne>	this is going nowhere.. i have ubuntu on another partition, graphics work fine, and it seems it is using nouveau. if i decide to go with nouveau for my arch installation, that's my problem but, what is you opinion about that?
<earnestly>	sine*
<braindamage>	a single frequency means that you have one only sine that will be necessary to produce your signal
<braindamage>	of a single freq
<braindamage>	to reproduce your signal from ideal sines, you'll need to sum up a certain amount, with different frequencies
<earnestly>	so perfect sines only really exist in mathematics?
<braindamage>	the function that gives the weights, it's the result of a fourier transform
<aremis117>	when you install steam you have to accept the lisence agreement right?  what if there isn't a 1 / true var going where it needs to for some reason.  what file does the lisence agreement change?
<earnestly>	hmm
<r4sp>	guys when i execute /bin/bash for example running a new terminal or whatever my arch freezes for 3 seconds. how can i check the reason for that?. i tried zsh and i get the same issue.
<earnestly>	braindamage: this makes some sense to me.  i can probably read about the rest in context
<brian_ch>	kaligne: don't know if it work with grub2, but at least before, you could blacklist it typing "modeset.nouveau=0" in the end of the grub entry of your kernel
<sudokode>	earnestly: it's like a line
<sudokode>	if you graph a linear equation, you don't make it go on forever because you can't. you just draw a line segment with some arrows
<aremis117>	kaligne: open source drivers are more desireable to me.  the users make the changes needed, not some guy in a tower who has an intel chip comp

<sudokode>	users are known to be unreliable though
<earnestly>	aaron of nvidia is a pretty cool guy nevertheless
<sudokode>	is that their one linux dev?
<earnestly>	pretty much
<braindamage>	bleh, sorry, i had 1 min lag
<sudokode>	heh
<d_garbage>	users my arse
<braindamage>	yes, perfect sines exist only in math
<braindamage>	real sines have lots of non-idealities, they have phase noise for example ( their period expands and contract over time ), or the fact itself they have a finite duration makes them not ideal
<earnestly>	braindamage: it's kind of obvious when it comes to perfect square waves
<braindamage>	those make so that the amount of ideal sines to describe them, instead of 1, becomes infinite
<earnestly>	because you can see that the number of transforms would need to be infinite to produce a perfect square wave
<braindamage>	eg this would be the transform of an ideal sine
<braindamage>	https://www.chem.purdue.edu/courses/chm621/text/ft/basiset/sine/sine.gif
<braindamage>	those are dirac deltas
<earnestly>	i know more about that man than his contributions, of which the list is insane.  people like him make me think nobel should be extended to mathematics
<braindamage>	in reality for a sine of finite duration you'll get 2 of the function of the right centered on the peaks: http://cnx.org/resources/af9ca97d2f0a55d7e6fe71023bd18f25/lowsinc.png
<braindamage>	which is the transform of a rectangle function in time, because you can see your sine of finite extension as an ideal sine * that windowing function
<sudokode>	earnestly: run `aplay -r 2000 <(yes)` in one terminal and `aplay -r 2001 <(yes)` in another

<qwazerty>	hi, i'm writing a pkgbuild for an haskell project, but it doesn't build against recent ghc version
<qwazerty>	what's the best way to handle this (please don't say rebuild ghc for this :p)
<earnestly>	qwazerty: you dare to try use something not from cabal or stackage?
<earnestly>	fix the haskell project to work against 7.10
<qwazerty>	i'm not able to fix it, but i could report it
<qwazerty>	not an haskell dev
<earnestly>	yeah, pretty much the best course
<earnestly>	is it ghcmod?
<qwazerty>	its a project used at my school
<earnestly>	yeah, report it as a problem
<earnestly>	also nice to see some schools using haskell (or anything ml-like)

<mpdavis73>	gonna try to export my zfs pool then try it
<escondida>	mpdavis73: what else do you have set to run at boot?
<mpdavis73>	so no zfs is mounted
<mpdavis73>	is not at boot, i can reproduce it by running updtaedb and waiting
<mpdavis73>	was running at midnight and freezing ~12:03-5 every morning
<mpdavis73>	zfs and nfs shares is about it other then normal svcs - and kvm virt machines
<jushur>	mpdavis73: ck kernel?
<mpdavis73>	jushur: is stock kernel, no mods made
<mpdavis73>	other than zfs modules
<jushur>	mpdavis73: i have no problem here.
<mpdavis73>	if it was related to zfs-git, someone else would have posted it - seems to be just the panic output that mantions
<mpdavis73>	mentions*
<mpdavis73>	looking thru lsmod output to dbl check modules
<jushur>	i did notice my system became a bit slugish while doing heavy copy from internal zfs drive to my backup zfs drive. but nothing else
<mpdavis73>	nouveau, kvm_intel, zfs-related, other normal modules
<jushur>	you made a special zvol for the swap right?
<mpdavis73>	mlocate is not installed as of now
<mpdavis73>	no swap :)
<jushur>	oh, but that is also bad
<mpdavis73>	not zfs on root, just storage
<jushur>	ok. np then
<mpdavis73>	24gb ram
<mpdavis73>	only time i had memory pressure was running a windows domain in kvm
<jushur>	well the ram is only good for the performance realy. wont matter for locks
<mpdavis73>	helps for kvm virt machines
<mpdavis73>	i can add a small swap if it will help
<jushur>	well ofc, because they like it when you use zfs as they get direct access to drive
<mpdavis73>	not against it, just didn't think i would need it
<mpdavis73>	i have a 2tb ext4 i can resize down a bit, nowhere close to full
<jushur>	some apps behave badly without swap
<mpdavis73>	zfs is a 1tb mirrored vdev
<mpdavis73>	when i tested, i disabled gdm, restarted, deleted the locate db, ran updatedb -v, and when that completed, ran a sleep 5, date loop until panic
<mpdavis73>	before i found the cause, i had left system monitor, top, and virt-manager where i could see utilizations, no issues with that
<jushur>	you do have ecc memmory?
<mpdavis73>	gonna try to disable gdm, restart, export my pool, then delete the locate db and run again
<mpdavis73>	nope, and weekly scrub was clean
<mpdavis73>	is a home pc, so board doesn't support it
<jushur>	try limit the memmory to the arc
<mpdavis73>	is limited, iirc, to 2gb
<ezalor>	just moved to arch and loving it :d
<jushur>	if its due to a memmory issue it could help
<mpdavis73>	after i was up for about a month once (lax on updates), arc was taking a lot of ram, so i limited it
<hhhhhhhh>	if i don't have a /dev/hci0 does that mean my bluetooth isnt working
<mpdavis73>	back in a bit, gonna go test with zpool exported - will rmmod zfs modules to be sure
<spartan-s63>	i have a question regarding arch installations on existing raid 0 arrays. i'm trying to install arch linux beside windows 8.1. i have a raid 0 array and a regular hard drive. i'm trying to install arch on the regular drive but the bootloader is on the raid array. how can i set this up to use windows' existing efi system partition?
<spartan-s63>	never mind, i figured it out.
<frederick>	folks can one please point me to a guide of how to use an american keyboard and use portuguese language accents and cedilla?
<aelius>	any dwm users in here?
<escondida>	frederick: you need a compose (multi_key) key. i set mine to be where right control usually is

<phrik>	title: runorraise | suckless.org dwm - dynamic window manager (at dwm.suckless.org)
<aelius>	but there is no documentation and i cannot figure out exactly what the run or raise code is actually searching for
<escondida>	frederick: you'd do that by setting the "compose:rctrl" xkboption in a snippet file in /etc/x11/xorg.conf.d
<earnestly>	(or setxkbmap)
<escondida>	frederick: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/keyboard_configuration_in_xorg#using_x_configuration_files <- how these files generally work.
<phrik>	title: keyboard configuration in xorg - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<escondida>	yes, or that.
<frederick>	escondida: thanks a lot
<escondida>	np
<escondida>	frederick: compose is a dead key, so to type á, you'd type compose, then a, then ', or compose, then ', then a
<maxwell>	well, it seems like either the -arch config or the 2 patches in the [core] linux package are preventing the kernel from failing to mount rootfs and panicing
<maxwell>	the thing is, i can't see how the patches are applied in the pkgbuild
<fe_still_waiting>	my wifi stopped working all of the sudden. i deleted my netctl profile and tried wifi-menu, but it says conneciton failed when i try to connect to any network. how can i fix this?
<hiptobecubic>	fe_still_waiting, unload and reload wifi drivers. if that fails, reboot. if that fails, then come back and ask again. my drivers shit the bed too frequently to count. it's really annoying.
<mpdavis73>	issue resolved :)
<mpdavis73>	bad snapshot from a couple of months ago, it seems
<mpdavis73>	from an ls -l on the .zfs of the snapshot, i got this:
<mpdavis73>	ls: cannot access /storage/.zfs/snapshot/201503081134/nobackup: too many levels of symbolic links
<mpdavis73>	and this: d????????? ? ? ? ?            ? public
<mpdavis73>	destroyed the snapshot and all is good
<jushur>	i see. should make a bugreport on it
<devgrohl>	yeah it seems like you broke something important
<mpdavis73>	not sure i could reproduce it - or how
<jushur>	could be because you dont use ecc memmory
<mpdavis73>	shouldn't have destroyed the snapshot
<mpdavis73>	per matt ahrens, ecc memory is better, but not needed
<jushur>	actually one bit flipped at start of it and the whole snapshot gets corrupted
<mpdavis73>	i think that is how he spells it
<mpdavis73>	that is the same with any file
<jushur>	no
<jushur>	if you had ecc it would noticed it. and fixed it
<jushur>	but its actually like one in a billion that it would happen exactly at the start of the snapshot to
<escondida>	oh, ffs...gtk doesn't implement the xcomposefile variable? it's defined in the xcompose manual
<mpdavis73>	but with a mirrored vdev, and weekly scrubs, it should have as well
<mpdavis73>	right?
<sammm>	hey, sometimes the kernel loads my audio devices in a different order and sets let's say my usb microphone as the default sound device, therefore no audio from speakers. i can use something like vlc and set the default audio device as my soundcard but things like mpd don't (at least not as simply as vlc). any ideas?
<sammm>	i basically want to set my sound card as the default device!
<jushur>	well do a bugreport and have the devs comment on it. im only a user.. tho as i understand it. that particular moment when you create the snapshot is a bit picky with correctness.
<dacoit>	sammm: do you use pulseaudio?
<sammm>	dacoit: i use alsa
<sammm>	dacoit: i had issues with pulseaudio and wine
<dacoit>	sammm: hmm i see. have you seen the modprobe.d confs on the arch wiki page on alsa? back when i used alsa, that worked fine to prevent the order switching up on me
<claudiop>	whats wrong with this command: "cat hugefilelist | grep foo | rm"  ?
<dacoit>	useless us of cat
<dacoit>	use
<sammm>	i'll take a look dacoit , thanks
<escondida>	claudiop: grep can read files, not just stdin.
<mpdavis73>	saw a talk on useless use of cat at self a couple years ago..lol
<dacoit>	claudiop: you would need xargs rm to make it work
<mpdavis73>	grep foo hugefilelist | xargs rm
<claudiop>	dacoit, "cat hugefilelist | grep foo | xargs rm" ?
<claudiop>	oh, ok
<mpdavis73>	looks dangerous
<claudiop>	what does xargs do btw?
<thrice>	grep foo hugefilelist | xargs
<dacoit>	try it ^
<mpdavis73>	issues rm <fiolename> for each found instance
<mpdavis73>	rm doesn't take piped input, i don't think
<claudiop>	oh, that explains why thrice's command has no rm ;)
<keenerd>	claudiop: depending on how hugefilelist was generated, it might be better to use 'find' and find's rm option.
<mpdavis73>	i would use -i with the rm
<thrice>	 | xargs echo?
<thrice>	:)
<claudiop>	keenerd, it was made from a script in the wiki to list all the orphan files in a system. it has absolute paths for all of them, one for line
<keenerd>	ah, disregard me then.
<mpdavis73>	still gives me pause - any rm that operates like that
<mpdavis73>	dangerous
<dacoit>	90% of the time i use xargs, it because i forget find's syntax :p
<escondida>	!grab dacoit
<phrik>	escondida: tada!
<mpdavis73>	as long as it gets the job done - better to look for most efficient way if you are on a prod server, but not much diff at home :)
<claudiop>	mpdavis73, any better idea to clean a 2mb long filelist of ruby gem leftovers?
<mpdavis73>	wish i could chmod -x less at work
<claudiop>	and i literally mean 2mb filelist, not 2mb of files in a list
<mpdavis73>	grep foo hugefilelist | head | xargs rm -iv     do that first, just to be sure
<claudiop>	mpdavis73, thats meant to see if im deleting what i really want to delete, correct?
<mpdavis73>	then go with grep foo hugefilelist | xargs rm -v > deletedfiles.txt
<mpdavis73>	exactly
<mpdavis73>	just to be on the safe side
<mpdavis73>	then you can review the files deleted, if you ned to
<claudiop>	mpdavis73, ehh, i would spend less time reinstalling the whole system. yet it seems the better way to do things the safe way.
<claudiop>	as far as there's not anything in the home dir, everything's fine
<mpdavis73>	head only gives you 10 lines, enough to test
<mpdavis73>	you can get rid of the "-v > deletedfiles.txt" if you want
<mpdavis73>	will make it faster in operation, but no record of deleted files - but you can get that from grep foo hugefilelist any time you want
<aelius>	how does one go about changing the instance and class name of a window?
<yumbox>	aelius: depends on your window manager
<aelius>	dwm
<claudiop>	mpdavis73, worked like a charm, and the computer is still working :p  hurray, thanks for helping me getting rid of ruby's waste without blowing the whole system away ;)
<aelius>	yumbox: xprop can change the classname but i just found a bug report that shows xprop -set cannot set a classname
<aelius>	i mean, instance
<aelius>	alternatively
<aelius>	can i wrap a terminal in some program that would change the classname but is otherwise invisible?
<packetprophet>	hello im trying to build a very hacker looking arch system
<packetprophet>	like everything from the terminal to impress my friends
<packetprophet>	but firefox is only loading in half a window
<packetprophet>	not sure how to explain
<claudiop>	when do you guys consider a system to simply be too old? i mean, my oldest working arch install has now almost 3 years, and its becoming harder and harder to get it as clean as a fresh install
<packetprophet>	https://i.imgur.com/vrzwpqp.jpg
<packetprophet>	is this normal for archlinux?
<dacoit>	!ops

<claudiop>	eventually it will be too full of crap and with too many broken dependencies (yea, because sometimes im lazy and just -rdd). when do i know it is time to do it?
<tigrmesh>	caleb, go for it
<caleb>	that mother fucker
<tigrmesh>	move like father f*
<tigrmesh>	*more like
<keenerd>	claudiop: that makes very little sense.
<keenerd>	claudiop: if you want to be "fresh" then blow away /etc and ~/.config and any other work you've done.
<keenerd>	(i wouldn't be surprised if most people here with +3 years of arch have always migrated old installs to new computers.)
<claudiop>	keenerd, don't your systems eventually accumulate more and more files left in random directories of the system? and sometimes pacman gets dependencies wrong, or you just -rddns because you wanted to clean a depedency config
<keenerd>	um, no.
<keenerd>	i would hire an exorcist.
<claudiop>	i actually install a lot of aur packages, thats part of the cause probably, but official packages also do that. i have tons of leftovers i would need to manually clean (not to delete anything needed) inside folders like /usr/share
<keenerd>	that would be a bug.
<keenerd>	(and if you want to play the aur game, do you have more than 400 aur packages installed?)
<dacoit>	jesus
<claudiop>	keenerd, even for aur packages? i always remove packages with the -rns , don't know if pacman keeps a list even for those
<d_garbage>	error: target not found: jesus
<claudiop>	keenerd, i never install more than 50, in any occasion, why?
<dacoit>	!grab d_garbage
<phrik>	dacoit: tada!
<claudiop>	do you have 400+?
<keenerd>	yes.
<aeon-ltd>	why?
<claudiop>	keenerd, holy crap, and why's that? are you like an aur mainetainer or some serious shit like that? o.0
<keenerd>	claudiop: there shouldn't be anything left.  if there is, then the package is missing a post-remove function.
<aeon-ltd>	just trying stuff? or you actually use 400+ utilities?
<claudiop>	keenerd, and in that case it would be usefull to report the bug?
<keenerd>	for official packages, yeah.  for aur you make a comment and ask the maintainer to fix it.
<claudiop>	btw, how do you update those 400+ packages? tools like yaourt with --noconfirm require user input every 5 minutes, do you have sudo with no password request for your user?
<keenerd>	claudiop: but if you are uncertain, feel free to run any "is this a bug?" question past this channel.
<claudiop>	yea, better do it. but most of my files-belonging-to-nobody were caused by ruby. its not really an arch bug, it is more of a ruby problem. got to check what do i got left other than ruby things
<mpdavis73>	ooh! exciting, linux-4.0.1-1
<mpdavis73>	been a few days since my last update
<keenerd>	claudiop: technically you can find these files before uninstalling.  they've be on the drive but not in pacman's database.
<keenerd>	let me see if i can find the script that collects them...
<andronas>	is this channel for chat too, or just for serious discussion?
<edit>	hello, i"m using kernel: 3.19.3-3-arch x86_64 (64 bit) & did a " pacman -syyu " and part of update has,, linux-4.0.1-1
<sheep>	andronas: it's mostly serious but there is #archlinux-offtopic
<edit>	any issues with uing, ???
<andronas>	cool thanks :)
<sheep>	edit: go for it!
<edit>	linux-4.0.1-1
<dacoit>	edit: its 4.0.1-1 is stable
<sheep>	edit: but make sure you have the package for the old kernel just in case
<mpdavis73>	make sure any aur packages that you use that have kernel modules are updated
<edit>	i have, so linux-4.0.1-1 is stable ..
<sheep>	edit: yes.
<edit>	ok.. thx
<sheep>	edit: there may be some bugs for some hardware drivers, but that was the case with every kernel update
<sheep>	even ones like 3.18 -> 3.19
<edit>	i thought, 3.18 was pretty stable
<sheep>	edit: it's really 3.20, not 4.0
<edit>	sheep:  >?
<sheep>	the version number change from 3.x to 4.x was arbitrary
<sheep>	it does not mean anything
<d_garbage>	edit, you don't need the extra 'y'
<d_garbage>	-syu is sufficient
<edit>	ok, as long as i stay on the "stable" i'm cool
<d_garbage>	also just because it's a stable release doesn't mean you wont have problems with it. you should always be ready for a non-booting system
<edit>	:)
<d_garbage>	helpfully, arch tends to hold off on new kernels until x.x.1
<aeon-ltd>	not bleeding edge enough 1edgy3me
<keenerd>	there is "homefully not broken" (normal repos), "probably broken" (testing), and "absolutely broken" (staging).
<mpdavis73>	there are worse things than a non-booting system
<aeon-ltd>	yeah full blown data corruption
<mpdavis73>	got stuck with a alpha/beta gcc once on redhat 7 - tearing my hair out with issues trying my first lfs build
<d_garbage>	fun
<cabreraalex>	so a likely common question: looking for a new laptop for college, and really want a macbookpro-like device for arch. any suggestions?
<d_garbage>	don't get a macbook?
<amcrae>	macbookpro?
<mpdavis73>	i just got a gazelle from system76
<halosghost>	cabreraalex: chromebook pixel with a hdd that you add yourself
<mpdavis73>	they have a galaga that may work
<mpdavis73>	i looked at chromeboks, couldn't find any with a matte 1080p screen
<cabreraalex>	how do you add an hdd to a chromebook...
<cabreraalex>	the pixel looks extremely nice though
<halosghost>	cabreraalex: open it up and replace the tiny one with a bigger one
<halosghost>	?
<mpdavis73>	lol
<cabreraalex>	well thank you :/
<halosghost>	mpdavis73: eww matte
<mpdavis73>	no glare
<d_garbage>	i dunno about laptops but i heard that matte was supposed to be the best
<halosghost>	yeah, but you ruin the higher color quality of nicer screens
<dacoit>	vim vs emacs
<mpdavis73>	bad eyes, glare kills me
<halosghost>	/kick dacoit
<d_garbage>	yeah, glossy screens look sexy but have glare problems don't they?
<halosghost>	d_garbage: don't use them outside?
<amcrae>	mpdavis73: an alpha/beta gcc and redhat 7 do not go together...
<halosghost>	d_garbage: don't use them in lighting situations with glare?
<d_garbage>	people go outside?
<d_garbage>	wow
<halosghost>	d_garbage: people that worry about glare must
<d_garbage>	brave folk
<dacoit>	halosghost: "you're holding it wrong."
<halosghost>	either that or they hae horrible lighting inside
<halosghost>	dacoit: lol
<mpdavis73>	amcrae: was gcc 2.96 in redhat 7 - not rhel, think older
<halosghost>	amcrae: \o/
<halosghost>	phrik: allanbrokeit
<phrik>	my liege!
<d_garbage>	amcrae, oh, how's your postcard project going? :)
<halosghost>	amcrae: how's life?
<tigrmesh>	dang.  i meant to buy a postcard today
<amcrae>	d_garbage: no received yet...  but only started on wednesday
<mpdavis73>	https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-2.96.html
<phrik>	title: gcc 2.96 - gnu project - free software foundation (fsf) (at gcc.gnu.org)
<d_garbage>	oh yeah, i suppose they have to go a long way, surface mail
<mpdavis73>	wow, forgot how long ago that was
<mpdavis73>	i feel old now
<amcrae>	that is gcc being silly because the egcc fork was around...
<d_garbage>	heh, it creeps up on you
<mpdavis73>	and in a whole new area in my career - scary
<d_garbage>	it's even worse for people born in this century because the math is so easy
<d_garbage>	much worse than omg is is is such-and-such years since 19xx?
<d_garbage>	is it*
<tigrmesh>	amcrae, ahhh
<mpdavis73>	lol - i'll be 42 this month - started with linux on 1999-2000
<d_garbage>	'appy birthday
<mpdavis73>	danke
<d_garbage>	you will soon know the meaning of life :)
<mpdavis73>	i'll be the answer :)
<d_garbage>	indeed!
<taozhijiang>	hello
<mpdavis73>	then i'll just stay 42 and forget the rest of my b'days
<amcrae>	!old
<phrik>	hullap fails hard
<taozhijiang>	i want to ask, if there are some tools to maintain battery, to avoid the battery over charged.
<taozhijiang>	for example, when the battery charged to 70%, stop charge the batter
<rena>	do modern batteries really still have that kind of issue
<devgrohl>	i think those are bios functions, i have never seen something to stop the a/c adapter from working
<rena>	and do the chargers really let it happen instead of automatically cutting the battery off
<devgrohl>	or something like that
<halosghost>	rena: overcharge? nah
<halosghost>	but, there are definitely practices that you can follow to increase the overall life of a battery
<devgrohl>	i remember that some bios in old laptops didnt knew when to change from ac to battery
<halosghost>	one of them is generally to keep the battery between 15 and 85 percent
<taozhijiang>	halosghost: yes, that's it
<taozhijiang>	halosghost: some windows power driver has that function
<halosghost>	taozhijiang: generally speaking, you'd need to have the ability to programmatically control your battery's firmware
<taozhijiang>	halosghost: example, thinkpad series
<halosghost>	taozhijiang: most batteries don't give you access to an api
<halosghost>	so, in most cases, you probably can't do this
<scimmia>	it is possible with lenovo, iirc
<scimmia>	there is a kernel module you need to access the options
<scimmia>	i never looked into it further than that
<halosghost>	scimmia: oh? which module?
<halosghost>	i'd love to be able to do this
<halosghost>	it's one of those things i looked into a while back and was unable to find anything helpful
<scimmia>	hold on, let me do some googline
<scimmia>	googling
<halosghost>	:d
<devgrohl>	i dont understand why would someone want to do that
<halosghost>	❤
<devgrohl>	you will just suck the life time in the battery
<halosghost>	devgrohl: prolong battery life
<halosghost>	umm
<halosghost>	no?
<devgrohl>	you want to keep it from a 80% or less
<devgrohl>	but still use it
<scimmia>	halosghost, http://tpctl.sourceforge.net/
<phrik>	title: tpctl homepage (at tpctl.sourceforge.net)
<scimmia>	i think that was it
<halosghost>	devgrohl: you want to keep it between 15 and 85 percent, yeah
<scimmia>	but it seems to be pretty old
<halosghost>	devgrohl: which is what i'm trying to do
<devgrohl>	then the cell between the 15 and 85 will be used
<halosghost>	scimmia: hmm, thanks for the tip
<devgrohl>	and eventually burn
<halosghost>	wut
<halosghost>	lol
<thrice>	i leave my laptop plugged in 90% of the time, battery hasn't changed too much in 2 years
<devgrohl>	i unplug the battery when is full
<devgrohl>	and thats all
<devgrohl>	5 years with the same battery and still have 63% at full capacity
<devgrohl>	which i think is much
<devgrohl>	for 12+ hours shifts
<devgrohl>	but well
<keenerd>	i dunno, my battery is four years old and at 99% capacity.  i keep it charged at 60% usually.
<keenerd>	but maybe the battery is lying or confused.
<devgrohl>	there is a command to check the real life %
<keenerd>	acpi -ib
<devgrohl>	i use one different
<devgrohl>	upower -i /org/freedesktop/upower/devices/battery_bat0
<halosghost>	you can actually check that information in the battery's uevent
<devgrohl>	it gives me this output: capacity: 63.0303%
<halosghost>	good lord
<halosghost>	after three or four years of common usage when i treat my batteries right, they get down to like 80 or 85
<taozhijiang>	percentage:          68%
<taozhijiang>	    capacity:            80.8333%
<taozhijiang>	devgrohl: means i can not fully charge this battery now?
<devgrohl>	that's what i understood
<halosghost>	sure you can
<keenerd>	taozhijiang: it means the "fully charged" mark is lower than before.
<devgrohl>	the capacity shows how much of the complete power in the battery you can get
<halosghost>	it's just that fully charging it won't yield the same capacity as when it was freshly made
<halosghost>	keenerd: ++
<taozhijiang>	then what's the percentage mean
<keenerd>	taozhijiang: brand new, your battery was full when it had 100 units of electricity in it.  now you battery is full when there are 80 units of electricity in it.
<devgrohl>	+1
<taozhijiang>	keenerd: i know, this is any method  to refresh my battery
<devgrohl>	to 100% there is no way
<halosghost>	taozhijiang: no
<taozhijiang>	keenerd: tell you the truth, this dell laptop with 4-cell battery, performance really bad enough
<devgrohl>	unless you are somekind of expert in electronics and can change the cells in the battery
<keenerd>	i've heard that fully charging it and fully discharging it can help, but that is also rough on the battery.
<halosghost>	never deeply discharge a battery
<halosghost>	great way to permanently kill it
<keenerd>	(and even then it doesn't do anything to the battery, just resets the internal health-tracking counter.)
<keenerd>	halosghost: no modern li-ion pack will let you deep discharge to the point of damage.
<halosghost>	keenerd: well, that's only partly true
<taozhijiang>	https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=182217
<phrik>	title: [solved] lenovo battery maintenance for linux? / laptop issues / arch linux forums (at bbs.archlinux.org)
<halosghost>	keenerd: when you discharge to 0, 0 != deeply discharging
<halosghost>	but that doesn't mean you can't deeply discharge one
<halosghost>	and discharging to 0 is still not great for the battery life
<keenerd>	no, but it should probably be done every couple of months to remind the circuitry that your battery can in fact go that low.
<halosghost>	i haven't read that, but i don't doubt its possibility
<keenerd>	though i've been avoiding doing a refresh cycle for the past year and haven't seen any sort of phantom capacity loss, so maybe the issue has been fixed.
<n00balert>	anyone has anything good to share about zfs on arch?
<devgrohl>	fuck sunsmicrosystems! buuuu
<devgrohl>	joking
<halosghost>	keenerd: yeah, the last time i had a battery which i had ever noticed real benefits from a refresh cycle was ~6 years ago on an android device
<devgrohl>	i dont know nothing about zfs
<d_garbage>	it's supposed to be good for large file sizes isn't it?
<n00balert>	d_garbage: the bigger the cache the better it works
<d_garbage>	but the driver isn't in the kernel i don't think
<n00balert>	nope
<n00balert>	it's an 'add-on'
<flaccid>	just need a check. /var/run is meant to be: /var/run: symbolic link to ../run ?
<n00balert>	so i guess the question is of its durability
<sheep>	flaccid, i think so
<n00balert>	mine r 2 diff dirs
<escondida>	flaccid: yup
<halfwit>	hmm. i must have missed the hubub-- linux 4.0 out of testing now
<flaccid>	thanks guys :)
<n00balert>	phew
<halfwit>	maybe my drivers will work without the git version now <3
<claudiop>	easiest way to get rid of qt desktop entries? deleting them is worthless since at the next update they'll get back
<claudiop>	alacarte doesn't work anymore
<escondida>	halfwit: no hubub. the version bump is cosmetic. linus torvalds got bored of the leading 3 (no, really)
<halfwit>	escondida: i know, i know!
<claudiop>	the same applies to avahi and opendjk. vanilla arch, i hate you...
<escondida>	halfwit: ah. i thought you thought there really was hubub.
<halfwit>	escondida: i almost hoped for one :3
<escondida>	claudiop: arch didn't design qt
<n00balert>	claudiop: try chocolate arch?
<claudiop>	escondida, yea, but couldnt the qt packager package the ide apart from the libraries?
<claudiop>	any way to make those desktop entries dissapear?
<claudiop>	n00balert, it makes the system heavier
<escondida>	verily, ifaith, nuncle
<escondida>	claudiop: if qt ever packages them separately, sure
<n00balert>	eh
<jamdox>	hey folks i am having a bevy of problems
<escondida>	claudiop: what desktop entries are you talking about?
<tigrmesh>	hey jamdox - what's going on?
<devgrohl>	jamdox: which kind of problems?
<jamdox>	i'm trying to set up a home server
<jamdox>	it's going ok, but subsonic can't add directories
<jamdox>	(i suspect this may be a mac utf8 issue)
<claudiop>	escondida, im talking about having "qt4 assistant, designer, linguist, qdbusview, ..." in a desktop system which will never use them. its like installing mathematica because i wanted to go to wolfram alpha...
<jamdox>	samba is taking 99% of one core
<claudiop>	why do qt packages that way?
<taozhijiang>	n00balert: try zfs with gentoo
<taozhijiang>	n00balert: feel greate
<n00balert>	sigh
<dexter>	feel good mane
<escondida>	claudiop: then don't install them
<jamdox>	(i suspect this is due to apple's crap smb implementation)
<jamdox>	and afp is just refusing connections
<devgrohl>	claudiop: why dont you remove them?
<claudiop>	because i need keepassx to live in peace
<claudiop>	and one dependency of keepassx is qt
<n00balert>	taozhijiang: why gentoo over arch?
<dexter>	i just keep my passwords in a plaintext file uploaded to a public ftp server
<devgrohl>	i just cant forget my passwords
<n00balert>	taozhijiang: why gentoo over arch (for zfs)?
<devgrohl>	and the ones harder i have them in the cellphone in a file encrypted
<taozhijiang>	n00balert: cause i do not know arch, but i love gentoo
<halfwit>	algorithmically defined passwords are legit.
<n00balert>	taozhijiang: how often do you update it?
<taozhijiang>	n00balert: and i success install gentoo with zfs
<taozhijiang>	quite frequently
<taozhijiang>	with a week
<n00balert>	taozhijiang: how many times it broke?
<taozhijiang>	within a week
<escondida>	claudiop: the qt devs seem to think you do need them. if you don't...why not just ignore them?
<taozhijiang>	n00balert: never
<n00balert>	taozhijiang: i find that hard to believe
<taozhijiang>	n00balert: gentoo never break up
<devgrohl>	neither do arch
<n00balert>	taozhijiang: issue is not gentoo...it's zfs
<escondida>	claudiop: i have qt 4 and i never even realized those were installed until you brought it to my attention...and now that i know, i still don't care.
<taozhijiang>	devgrohl: probobaly not
<claudiop>	escondida, if you used gnome shell you would, since you get your applications in the middle of those useless unremovable icons
<n00balert>	taozhijiang: those upstream guys add features/functions at will...
<devgrohl>	let's dont fight about which distro this or that
<n00balert>	with bsd and solaris in mind...not linux.
<claudiop>	not pretty, not functional, not usefull
<escondida>	claudiop: you could always just rebuild the package if it bugs you that much
*	topic for #archlinux is: welcome to arch linux world domination, inc. <+> read: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=57205 <+> be patient with those willing to learn and be kind to those willing to teach. <+> hubble is 25, all hail our science overlord: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2oiaa1tdre
<amcrae>	keenerd: nothing c++ built with gcc-5.1 should have moved from [testing]...  people never learn!
<d_garbage>	i'm not very adveturous for an arch user. i tend to hold back on things and wait to see if there's any major problems with them. not very brave i know but i like things just to work at the moment
<keenerd>	amcrae: we only have the one [staging] so overlap was inevitable.
<escondida>	d_garbage: that's crazy talk. you feeling alright?
<d_garbage>	heh, ikr
<scimmia>	yep, amcrae that one was on you. gcc 5.1 shouldn't have gone into staging/testing until the boost rebuild was complete
<d_garbage>	hehe
<amcrae>	i underestimated dev/tu knowledge once again...
<scimmia>	yep :)
<amcrae>	over estimated
<amcrae>	i did something
<keenerd>	overestimated?  so, um, what should we have done?
<d_garbage>	but at least you don't have to worry to much right? i mean people who use arch going to be self reliant and expect the occasional problem and not whine about things... oh, wait }:]
<scimmia>	ironically, the people running testing had no problems :d
<d_garbage>	from what i've heard people running testing have suprisingly few problems generally
<allanbrokeit>	keenerd: seen that gcc-5.1 entered the repos from the arch-dev-public post and blocked it updating in your chroots
<jamdox>	listen guys, i can live with this samba thing, but subsonic is killing me
<jamdox>	i don't know, it worked on ubuntu
<jamdox>	>macfag
<jamdox>	fleedom!
<escondida>	jamdox: keep it civil. also, what errors are you running into?
<jamdox>	i enter the folder but it can't find it
<jamdox>	eg /mnt/drive/music
<jamdox>	which is available, read/write, etc, and it says "folder not found"
<jamdox>	[5/2/15 11:28:11 pm cdt]	info	musicfolderdao	created music folder mnt/drive/music
<jamdox>	is the only log entry
<escondida>	jamdox: does it recognize other directories?
<jamdox>	not really... i tried copying a music directory to /home/user/music and it gives the same error
<foutrelis>	allanbrokeit: that's not how chroots work
<allanbrokeit>	why not?   that is what i did...
<jamdox>	if i tell it to use /home/user it'll load it, but nothing shows up in the library
<foutrelis>	and other than the kernel (which breaks like vmware, so i don't care) and wxgtk (which i patched), i don't think much more software broke
<allanbrokeit>	there was several boost bugs that i saw
<allanbrokeit>	boost related
<foutrelis>	oh, that sounds bad :p
<allanbrokeit>	nah - who uses that anyway :p
<aelius>	this article makes it sound so great, why is it not just default https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/linux-ck
<phrik>	title: linux-ck - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<allanbrokeit>	because upstream says no
<dacoit>	bfs' advantages over cfs arent that significant
<foutrelis>	allanbrokeit: how do you even block gcc 5.1 from a staging chroot? :3
<dacoit>	and less scalable, as ck would say himself.
<jamdox>	i also tried the good old chmod -r 0777
<allanbrokeit>	foutrelis: create clean chroot, install gcc-4.9, build
<allanbrokeit>	could do it automatically by adding makedepends=(gcc-4.9) and then removing it :p
<foutrelis>	allanbrokeit: using staging-x86_64-build you'd have to download gcc 4.9 locally and install it with the -i switch
<foutrelis>	still feels like a funky workaround :3
<jamdox>	;_;
<jamdox>	my pepper is becoming less and less green
<allanbrokeit>	people use staging-x86_64-build!
<foutrelis>	of course, archbuild scripts ftw
<escondida>	jamdox: do you have write permissions to /var/lib/subsonic?
<escondida>	read and write, i should say, plus execute on the directory and only the directory
<flaccid>	wouldn't happen to be an admin that does aur-requests@archlinux.org (merge) alive that can expedite my merge requests here ?
<allanbrokeit>	hrm...  i wonder if i can...
<jamdox>	var/lib/subsonic is drwxr-xr-x
<escondida>	jamdox: who owns it, and what group is it in?
<miaofengwei>	(miaofengwei) can archlinux adopt kdbus before merged?
<caioau>	hello from brazil, when i got new mail, i get a "notification" on terminal (using postfix) . how to do that with exim ? thanks
<jamdox>	subsonic:subsonic.
<dacoit>	it would be silly to
<allanbrokeit>	miaofengwei: not likely
<holomorph>	look it's allan
<allanbrokeit>	where?
<holomorph>	i must have been hallucinating
<jamdox>	i tried setting the service to user=subsonic and user=user
<jamdox>	i could try adding myself to subsonic group and making everything 0770
<miaofengwei>	thanks
<jamdox>	or 0771
<escondida>	jamdox: try asking in their official channel, first. also, generally make sure you're running it in exactly the way their docs recommend running it.
<jamdox>	yeah, their channel is pretty dead and their documentation...
<escondida>	their documentation...?
<jamdox>	wait, it exists?
<escondida>	i dunno, i never heard of it
<escondida>	!wiki subsonic
<phrik>	escondida: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/subsonic
<escondida>	jamdox: as always, there's the wiki, at least. ↑
<jamdox>	yeah, it's in aur.  i'd use something else, but i haven't found anything else really
<jamdox>	lol the wiki broke it
<escondida>	hmm
<escondida>	what step?
<jamdox>	sudo -u subsonic ${java} -xmx${subsonic_max_memory}m \
<jamdox>	change to that from ${java} -xmx${subsonic_max_memory}m \
<miaofengwei>	kernel devs seems dislike dbus. so kdbus for 4.2 likely to merge?
<escondida>	miaofengwei: it's useless to speculate.
<escondida>	jamdox: sudo -u subsonic echo $java $subsonic_max_memory
<escondida>	does that give you the results you're expecting?
<escondida>	jamdox: (in that script)
<jamdox>	let me see, this will take a sec
<devgrohl>	does the filter in weechat to hide join/quit needs to be in a config to be permanent?
<escondida>	devgrohl: if you just enabled it, do /save
<devgrohl>	nice nice
<devgrohl>	im new in the ircs
<escondida>	gotcha
<jamdox>	it's better, now it's at least saying that subsonic is not in sudoers
<jamdox>	instead of just saying "wut"
<escondida>	it probably shouldn't be in sudoers
<escondida>	run the script as your user
<escondida>	jamdox: you know, it occurs to me...why not just run mpd?
<escondida>	mpd can stream
<jamdox>	can mpd stream over the internet? and does it have a mobile app?
<escondida>	there's probably a mobile client for it
<escondida>	and yes it can
<holomorph>	http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/clients
<phrik>	title: clients - music player daemon community wiki (at mpd.wikia.com)
<holomorph>	lol
<escondida>	holomorph to the rescue!
<escondida>	i really need to sleep
<holomorph>	me too
<devgrohl>	i dont
<devgrohl>	sleep it's overvaluated
<jamdox>	running the shell as myself says it's started but that i don't have permissions on the log
<jamdox>	but it's not up...
<escondida>	jamdox: where does it log?
<jamdox>	var/lib/subsonic/subsonic_sh.log
<escondida>	ah, nevermind. i misunderstood.
<jamdox>	i could try re-editing the service to run as user instead of subsonic
<escondida>	jamdox: yeah, the more i look at the wiki page, the more outdated it looks. there are still references to /etc/rc.d, for crying out loud. i'd say get rid of your configs and dir in /var/lib/subsonic and reinstall
<jamdox>	yeah, i installed from aur but i'm thinking of just using the standalone installer from the website.
<escondida>	jamdox: i'd say to just check the pkgbuild against its installer to make sure they're actually following the directions. it's generally better to install things as proper packages.
<jamdox>	the package in aur is up to date
<escondida>	anyway, good luck to you. 'night
<escondida>	!bail
<phrik>	looks like escondida is bailing out on this one - good luck!
<jamdox>	but yeah, i'm going to have to dig into this
<jamdox>	thanks
<aelius>	humblebundle gave me a binary file for super hexagon. i assume it must be compiled for 32bit, but the rather unhelpful error i get when trying to run it is "command not found"
<aelius>	is that normal?
<allanbrokeit>	yes
<aelius>	ok

<diegoviola>	3 meters, violent fall
<tekken>	good news!

<tekken>	:(
<jesin>	ah, i see
<jesin>	i recently bought a used thinkpad and i'm really happy with it so far
<jesin>	diegoviola: were you at least able to save the hard drive?
<diegoviola>	jesin: yes but i've donated it to a friend as it's useless for me right now
<diegoviola>	gave ram away too

<diegoviola>	not really
<jesin>	diegoviola: ok cool. sometimes data is the hardest thing to replace <_<
<diegoviola>	jesin: why hardest?
<tom^>	ive never quite understood that, i could wipe everything right now and all it would take is a couple painful redownloads and im back.

<sigttou>	particleman72: tested with other operating system to ensure it's not a hardware error?
<particleman72>	nope. it could be a bad switch i guess but i cant "make" it happen
<particleman72>	bump it ,smack it, bend it nada
<sigttou>	particleman72: try it with another live cd - if it works we can blame your current setup ;)
<particleman72>	yeah. the only bummer is some times it takes hours or even all day
<particleman72>	then sometimes it happens several times in a few minutes
<sigttou>	that sounds really like a hardware error ;)
<particleman72>	yeah it very well could be this thing is like 10 years old
<sigttou>	after testing we would know for sure^^ otherwise disabling the lid action is a fast solution
<sigttou>	otherwise, opening the case and removing/replacing the switch would be possible?
<particleman72>	yeah im sure it could be done but i dont think im willing to spend anything on this
<particleman72>	its an old hp dv6700
<particleman72>	should have burned up years ago'
<particleman72>	dual core turion
<john_f>	nearby mri machine?
<particleman72>	hahah
<particleman72>	i have an e cigg with a magnetic door already made sure that was noot causing it :p
<particleman72>	i just think its time to slowly start breaking the news to the wife
<particleman72>	i have had this arch install for almost 5 years now
<junka>	scrot is the only option for screen capturing?
<junka>	oh i have xwd too
<junka>	oh that's for terminals only? :p
<john_f>	gimp has a screen capture dialog
<junka>	yeah i know, but i already love scrot :p
<haix64>	hi. i can't diagnose this: when i'm online(network) firefox and emacs have a delay before loading (3~10 secs). but just as i disconnect, they run instantly. helps?
<john_f>	haix64: strace -f emacs may show you what it is waiting for.
<freaj>	junka: hello, you can use maim -s if you want to capture a part of the screen, but scrot is fine yes.
<haix64>	john_f: the amount of information in strace is mind-boggling! i'd not used it before
<haix64>	john_f: gonna trace... thanks for the pointer ;-)
<john_f>	usually trying to open a file or reading from a socket. but yeah low level functions.
<john_f>	see what it is repeating during the delay.
<junka>	freaj; maim?
<junka>	freaj; which pkg provides it
<freaj>	junka: well, "maim"
<haix64>	john_f: it tries to connect to the primary dns server. but i have no idea why does it take so long, and why does emacs connect to the dns server in the first place at all!

<linnak>	hi
<linnak>	can someone make an installation tutorioal with this image https://www.archlinux.org/download/ on a 12gb virtualdrive?
<phrik>	title: arch linux - downloads (at www.archlinux.org)
<tom^>	linnak: no.
<tom^>	!give linnak wiki beginners
<phrik>	linnak: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/beginners'_guide
<linnak>	that's what i thought
<linnak>	wiki even it says beginners guide is not for beginners
<junka>	freaj; thanks! :d
<tom^>	linnak: exactly, use some other distro if beginners guide is to hard.
<john_f>	haix64: does ping/dig localhost and by your hostname return 127.0.0.1?
<linnak>	i can install any other distro
<linnak>	even freebsd
<linnak>	but i tried 30 times arch and i couldn't
<linnak>	i need to learn this to install
<haix64>	john_f: yes
<tom^>	!give linnak wiki install guide
<phrik>	linnak: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide
<tom^>	that is all that needs to be done.
<syedomar>	linnak: dont give up
<tom^>	its like a 5 minute process.
<linnak>	syedomar :)
<haix64>	john_f: hostname gives my lan ip (192.168.1.68)
<linnak>	i've just gave up the 30th installation
<linnak>	syslinux could't set bootflag
<linnak>	have a nice day
<linnak>	bye
<coolthingy500>	and another one bites the dust.
<syedomar>	gone with the wind
<haix64>	john_f: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/emacs#incorrect_network_configuration. that's the answer, but i'm curious to know why would my text editor enforce net config? any idea?
<phrik>	title: emacs - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<coolthingy500>	that's it a kansas song. jk
<haix64>	john_f: adding the hostname to /etc/hosts fixed it. gonna get back to work though, but still badly curious! thanks anyway.
<freaj>	junka: i've been using it for months with the screenshot key handled by maim -s (and a random name to save the file in my screenshots folder), sad it's not famous x.x
<john_f>	hmm, i thought it was no longer needed, or automated elsewhere.
<shadowkatstudios>	crazy thought: one day, ipv4 will be old technology like token ring
<tekken>	wow.... ftb caused a sigbus error
<tekken>	not seen one of those in quite a bit
<junka>	freaj; yeah it's promoted as an improved scrot!
<junka>	and it is
<coolthingy500>	i'm still waiting for ipv6. what the hell!
<tekken>	ipv6 is not important
<tekken>	:d
<coolthingy500>	:d i'm just messing about.
<coolthingy500>	i doubt i would be able to tell the difference between the two.
<chris|>	i am trying to build packages using makechrootpkg, but whenever the chroot tries to install a dependency, i get a "... is corrupted (invalid or corrupted package (pgp signature))" error. has anyone else experienced this?
<tekken>	chris|: i know how to fix your issue!
<tekken>	mkdir -p ~/.gnupg
<earnestly>	that's not the solution
<chris|>	nope, that isn't it
<tekken>	chris|: did you run the command again?
<chris|>	tekken: to what should
<earnestly>	chris|: remove the corrupted package download and try a different mirror
<chris|>	~ even resolve in the chroot?
<donrichie>	i noticed that after i log into arch the start of my ssh daemon is delayed by 1 minute and 30 seconds. is this some kind of systemd asynchronous boot magic?
<tekken>	that doesn't sound normal.
<earnestly>	donrichie: it means something is failing and it is waiting before continuing the boot
<earnestly>	check your logs
<donrichie>	i think the delay occures when dhcpcd is working
<earnestly>	no
<earnestly>	wasamasa: btw, cs2 is free now
<donrichie>	aaahhh
<donrichie>	red font
<donrichie>	mai 03 11:16:42 archvm systemd[1]: timed out waiting for device sys-subsystem-net-devices-enp3s0.device.
<donrichie>	yes, i remember i typed the wrong name
<donrichie>	will disable it :d
<earnestly>	that's more like it :p
<shanemikel>	are you running sshd for a specific network interface?
<phiphler>	i'm having problems with polkit.service, is this a known issue? when i check the status of the process it has failed and i can't use systemctl to restart, start, stop etc. services
<donrichie>	no, but i think i found the source of the delay. i enabled networking for the device enp3s0 and not enp0s3. i remember that i did it but i though it had no effect. mistake by me
<donrichie>	thank you for your help
<wasamasa>	earnestly: well, yeah, grabbed it months ago
<earnestly>	wasamasa: but legitmately free, all cs2 stuff
<wasamasa>	earnestly: i thought there was the restriction that it's only legal for license holders?
<tom^>	cs2 = ?

<wasamasa>	earnestly: 2013!
<shanemikel>	donrichie: i'm just curious because you should be able to run the ssh server whether or not you're actually connected to a network
<earnestly>	wasamasa: okay, so awhile ago :p
<donrichie>	shanemikel: yes, but the execution of ssh itself is delayed because of the networking-timeout
<donrichie>	thats what i suppose^
<shanemikel>	wow, gitg is getting pretty nice
<chris|>	earnestly: doesn't help, other mirrors produce the same issue
<thurstylark>	what do i need to do to give a user access to /dev/ttyusb0?
<junka>	omg
<junka>	minecraft is in the aur? pls
<thurstylark>	junka: yeah, i don't really understand why...
<tom^>	why not?
<sheep>	thurstylark: try adding the user to the 'uucp' group then logging out
<thurstylark>	because the launcher auto-downloads everything, imo. it's in a nice little package
<tom^>	the launcher wont put binaries in your $path amongs other things.
<ruan>	the launcher downloads stuff to ~/.minecraft/libraries
<shanemikel>	favorite bug trackers?
<sheep>	shanemikel: arch uses flyspray
<thurstylark>	tom^: good point.
<shanemikel>	i'm looking for something light, easy installation, good for a small project
<demize>	easy, all of them suck.
<allanbrokeit>	that is accurate
<shanemikel>	*installation/admin
<shanemikel>	demize: next you're gonna tell me that git sucks and you recommend emailing diff patches around
<junka>	is there a good mmorpg multiplayer and open source game?
<demize>	shanemikel: why would i?
<junka>	hello demize
<shanemikel>	demize: nvm..
<junka>	demize; did that maintainer contact you?
<demize>	junka: was probably from an orphan cleanup.
<shanemikel>	demize: if all the trackers youve used suck, perhaps you could share with me which sucked the most and why?
<junka>	demize; will you package it?
<demize>	i can't think of any that sucks less really. most of them are either slow, have really clunky interfaces, barely have any features, have really crappy search, or a combination of the above
<demize>	junka: when my key gets signed, sure.
<fawaz>	hi, has anyone tryied upgrading to 4.0 kernel?
<junka>	demize; thank you :)
<demize>	fawaz: many has.
<fawaz>	demize, do you know if there are any issues, like with vm or such?
<demize>	no.
<demize>	!ask
<phrik>	don't ask to ask, if anyone is here or alive, or uses something. just ask, and we'll get moving along. thanks.

<shanemikel>	but python works for me
<shanemikel>	curious....
<nkparadox>	ofc it works im just curius

<p2e>	a long time ago in a land far away (before i switched to arch), i used aterm. can someone recommend the best lightweight, fast terminal
<alad>	p2e: termite
<thelemonman>	st or termite i'd say
<p2e>	unicode support?
<alad>	yes
<alad>	true color too
<p2e>	what is this "true color" you speak of
<p2e>	colors are real?
<thelemonman>	the song
<alad>	p2e: https://gist.github.com/xvilka/8346728
<demize>	24-bit colors.
<phrik>	title: true color (16 million colors) support in various terminal applications and terminals (at gist.github.com)
<p2e>	will it also hold its color, like a pendulum?
<sheep>	st is really lightweight.  it doesn't even do scrolling on its own.  you'll need to run screen or tmux inside it
<p2e>	ok, st is out
<p2e>	i do want scrolling but i'm ok with simple scrolling (i disable scrollbars)
<thelemonman>	there's a patch to have built-in scrolling
<shanemikel>	st definitely works
<bellbreaker>	i get a segfault every time i send sigterm to a process
<shanemikel>	!google st patches suckless
<phrik>	shanemikel: patches | suckless.org st - simple terminal: <http://st.suckless.org/patches/>
<p2e>	just need to point this out, neither of these are in the regular repos
<sheep>	they aren't
<sheep>	urxvt is another one.  i'm not sure if i'd call lilyterm 'lightweight'
<sheep>	but that's what i use
<shanemikel>	p2e: as far as st is concerned, it don't matter if it's avail as binary cause you'll want to use the header files to configure and compile
<wildefyr>	urxvt is probably the best one around for beginners, extensible but not overly complicated
<shanemikel>	just like dwm
<alad>	cd
<alad>	(derp)
<p2e>	~$
<p2e>	also need to figure out why firefox keeps firing javascript errors at me
<alad>	on what sites?
<shanemikel>	i'm pretty sure st is way 'lighter' than rxvt
<p2e>	alad: i think it's a plugin =[
<p2e>	which is annoying because i don't have many installed, all of them are pretty useful
<p2e>	i think i should've been careful to state that rxvt is probably lightweight "enough".....i just don't want to go installing gnome-terminal
<xyzaffa1r>	fix it: openspades: error while loading shared libraries: libglew.so.1.11: cannot open shared object file: no such file or directory
<p2e>	xyzaffa1r: ok, i fixed it
<p2e>	now what
<alad>	heh
<xyzaffa1r>	p2e, how do i fix it my self?
<shanemikel>	p2e: if you do decide to use st, beware of the fact that it references xfonts directly in the source, so you need to make sure the font is installed, or change it in the config.h header .. other than that, i don't remember having problems with it
<p2e>	xyzaffa1r: i typed /clear in the irc window and the error vanished.
<xyzaffa1r>	i don't know what that does, but i am pretty sure it won't fix it :)
<xyzaffa1r>	some one help me.
<p2e>	xyzaffa1r: might be helpful to tell someone what you tried to do and when you got the error rather than just ordering us to fix it
<xyzaffa1r>	p2e, maybe, i tried to launch openspades and that is the only output i revieved.
<xyzaffa1r>	*recieved.
<shanemikel>	if you're looking for a modern term that's pretty independent of de libs, terminology is a good'n
<e1z0>	yeah, #archlinux number one on freenode!
<e1z0>	\o/
<alad>	xyzaffa1r: glew was updated and arch doesn't keep old libraries around. rebuild the package
<xyzaffa1r>	alad, ok, thank you.
<xyzaffa1r>	problem
<bellbreaker>	or the reverse alad
<xyzaffa1r>	i tried that and it didnt work
<binero>	hello, i am having some trouble starting the packet filtering service (iptables)
<bellbreaker>	try updating libglew then
<binero>	systemctl gives me process: 319 execstart=/usr/bin/iptables-restore /etc/iptables/iptables.rules (code=exited, status=1/failure)
<binero>	it says iptables-restore[319]: can't open /etc/iptables/iptables.rules: no such file or directory
<binero>	is it safe to just create this file empty?
<p2e>	well if the file doesn't exist you're not going to break anything by trying to create it
<p2e>	oh
<p2e>	you're gone
<p2e>	ff
<xyzaffa1r>	alad, http://sprunge.us/aauh
<earnestly>	well, it shouldn't be empty in either case.
<xyzaffa1r>	can rebuild it.

<wasamasa>	earnestly: an article on database architecture taking cpu caches in account?
<earnestly>	wasamasa: shocking, i know.  :p
<earnestly>	people just don't really grasp *how* much faster good data locality is
<alad>	xyzaffa1r: use makepkg
<earnestly>	i wish language designers would make their syntax and constructs more machine friendly.  you can always spot a badly designed language if you have to write ugly non-idiomatic code to get the performance you should get almost by default
<xyzaffa1r>	alad, but i haven doen't it with out using pacaur is so long, it takes longer.
<p2e>	i wish javascript would up and die

<hannibal_smith>	earnestly, it would also include languges like standardml
<earnestly>	hannibal_smith: hm?
<hannibal_smith>	you can't express the memory layout when defining your own records/types
<earnestly>	hannibal_smith: you shouldn't have to
<shanemikel>	what about julia? hannibal_smith ?
<earnestly>	that's highly implementation specific and should be effecient based on the architecture
<hannibal_smith>	shanemikel, never used it
<earnestly>	hannibal_smith: compilers like mlkit can almost completely get rid of the gc in sml (region analysis)
<hannibal_smith>	earnestly, see what you have to do in haskell to manage the meory layout
<hannibal_smith>	they have to do this, because the compiler can't do it for the developer
<earnestly>	hannibal_smith: i blame cisc for that mostly
<shanemikel>	afaict it's the up and coming lang for nerds like y'all
<hannibal_smith>	earnestly, uhm...why?
<earnestly>	hannibal_smith: because it makes compiler designs much more complex and determinism goes out the window
<earnestly>	hannibal_smith: cisc was created to make writing assembly easier, which is not what we do anymore.
<hannibal_smith>	from the little that i have read, the major problem is considering a good cost model for a modern cpu
<earnestly>	in fact, you can't even write crypto code on x86 that isn't susceptible to side-channel timing attacks
<hannibal_smith>	more than a risc/cisc
<earnestly>	hannibal_smith: consider http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burroughs_large_systems
<phrik>	title: burroughs large systems - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (at en.wikipedia.org)
<earnestly>	because x86 does not have determinable performance characteristics
<hannibal_smith>	earnestly, uhm that is a lot to read
<earnestly>	hannibal_smith: see the unique features
<earnestly>	hannibal_smith: these machines are still used, praised by even ewd
<earnestly>	transmeta was also a nice idea
<hannibal_smith>	partially data-driven tagged and descriptor-based design <-wow for me it's the first time seeing something like this
<hannibal_smith>	interesting link earnestly, thank you
<earnestly>	oh, coincidently, the burroughs machines are what godard wrote the algol compiler for.  godard is the chap pushing forward the new "belt machine" mill cpus
<earnestly>	which is basically a vliw stack machine with a twist :p
<junka>	when i have a local dns resolver and dnssec support, does the dns server needs to support dnssec validation too?
<bellbreaker>	it will be interesting to see how the mill does
<hannibal_smith>	earnestly, do you think that the set of optimizations that a modern cpu does today are possible also with a such architecture without a real assembly language?
<bellbreaker>	an architecture without an assembly language?
<disappointment>	lolwut
<hannibal_smith>	bellbreaker, se the previous lik
<hannibal_smith>	*link
<hannibal_smith>	no assembly language or assembler; all system software written in an extended variety of algol 60. however, espol had statements for each of the syllables in the architecture. <-
<bellbreaker>	wouldn't that be an assembly language then if there is such a close mapping between the language and actual instructions
<xyzaffa1r>	adal, fine, i am building it with makepkg, may have done it wrong, it's been a long time. i just un tared it and ran makepkg -s.
<alad>	yep
<hannibal_smith>	bellbreaker, personally i see assembly as a sequence of instruction that modify some architectual components
<xyzaffa1r>	adal, building it returned an error: ==> error: 'pacman' failed to install missing dependencies.
<alad>	(didn't think my name was this hard to type)
<alad>	xyzaffa1r: so what do you  think that error message means?
<xyzaffa1r>	alad, the dependancies are only in the aur so pacman couldn find them?
<xyzaffa1r>	alad, i assume that's the problem.
<xyzaffa1r>	which is why i got pacaur, so i wouldn have to hunt down a million dependancies from the aur to build
<xyzaffa1r>	.
<alad>	if it had aur dependencies - but openspades doesn't have aur dependencies
<alad>	building works for me, let's see if it finishes
<xyzaffa1r>	alad, i could build it but it didn finish.
<alad>	will take a while on this atom
<xyzaffa1r>	alad, took some time on my celeron.
<moetunes>	more cores, no snores
<torulv>	which dir holds the configs for gnome?
<xyzaffa1r>	torulv. .gnome? .conig/gnome?
<alad>	gnome stores configs in a binary database
<xyzaffa1r>	one of the two.
<alad>	man 7 dconf
<xyzaffa1r>	aw
<xyzaffa1r>	iḿ dumb.
<torulv>	alad: and this database is in ~/.config ?
<alad>	this starts to sound like an xy problem. what's your exact problem?
<alad>	xyzaffa1r: managed to build and install openspades without issue, starts as well
<xyzaffa1r>	alad, oh no, what do.
<xyzaffa1r>	i will try again i suppose
<alad>	xyzaffa1r: if you have the package built, install with pacman -u
<alad>	(or makepkg -si)
<alad>	man makepkg and man pacman
<hannibal_smith>	bellbreaker, if you are interested, i found the reference manual of the language that the linked architecture use http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/burroughs/b5000_5500_5700/1032638_b5500_espol_refmanoct67.pdf
<hannibal_smith>	it's impression how short that document is
<xyzaffa1r>	alad, i ran makepkg -si and it is just building it again, will report back when it's done.
<alad>	k
<swordfischer>	hi, i'm trying to setup uefi boot in gentoo, and read the arch documentation for gummiboot. i can get the uefi to load gummiboot, but that's as far as it goes.. my entries are not shown, so it only has one options and that is to boot into firmware

<mrelendig>	xyzaffa1r: i bet the dep is in aur too
<mrelendig>	swordfischer: did you actually make some entries?
<xyzaffa1r>	mrelendig, thatś what i though, then i didn't do anything with that thought.
<mrelendig>	swordfischer: also #gentoo does exist
<mrelendig>	xyzaffa1r: post full output
<swordfischer>	mrelendig: yeah i 've been to #gentoo, but didn't receive much help there, and as the doc is from arch i assumed some arch users might be of assistance :)
<swordfischer>	mrelendig: and yeah, i did add some entries under esp/loader/entries/
<mrelendig>	gentoo probably does stupid things to gummiboot
<mrelendig>	like they do to everything else
<mrelendig>	specially since gummiboot is now a part of systemd, and we all know how "herp derp durp" the gentoo people every time systemd is mentioned
<xyzaffa1r>	meelending, i am building something that i think is the dep seperatly right now, if this doesn work out i will but i can until it is done.

<mrelendig>	swordfischer: you get the menu at all?
<swordfischer>	mrelendig: yeah i get the menu, only with one entry which is "reboot into firmware device", so i 'assume' that i misplaced the config files

<phrik>	title: freedesktop.org git repository browser (at cgit.freedesktop.org)
<mrelendig>	more than one esp?
<swordfischer>	nope, just that one, and that has gummiboot.
<earnestly>	hannibal_smith: (yes)
<earnestly>	hannibal_smith: (more in fact, as compilers get smarter.  it is often the case that compilers will only use the risc-bits of a cisc architecture just to get the performance (deterministic-ish).  also consider stuff like greenarrays which uses forth)
<hannibal_smith>	earnestly, if i remember correctly, they does so because complex instruction can't benefits of optimizations like out of order excecution
<hannibal_smith>	that the sequence of simpler instruction doing the same operation can do
<hannibal_smith>	well, there are exceptions like related to simd
<hannibal_smith>	i don't know about forth unfortunatelly
<bellbreaker>	i thought the risc vs. cisc debate had been settled firmly in favour of risc
<hannibal_smith>	earnestly, thinking about it, not only they don't benefits from superscala architecture, they are also implementated in microde that is usually not fast
<bellbreaker>	now that we don't write exclusively in assembler
<hannibal_smith>	bellbreaker, i remember also things like arm including complex instructions...
<junka>	gcc 5.1 is on testing :o
<hannibal_smith>	but i can't remember the scope of these
<xyzaffa1r>	mrelending, i started doing other things and forgot about this, trying once again to makepkg -s to provide output, sorry.
<hannibal_smith>	probably related to simd
<bellbreaker>	neither the arm nor x86 isa are risc
<bellbreaker>	but intel uses risc cores that interpret the cisc x86 instructions afaik
<xyzaffa1r>	mrelending, it seems to not be able to find imagemagick
<mrelendig>	xyzaffa1r: please start using your <tab> key
<xyzaffa1r>	because when building i am getting a ton of errors where it can find that.
<mrelendig>	and post actual output
<allanbrokeit>	junka: has been for a while...
<mzgnr>	hello everyone. i have a bug with the latest kernel, whcih i cant describe with my low level english. i recerded a video. can you tell me what is wrong with it ? https://youtu.be/kpliq-l1r_g
<xyzaffa1r>	mrelendig, never, it is still running, then i will.
<egasimus>	hi folks, how can i add broadcom wifi firmware to my installation usb?
<egasimus>	already built b43-firmware from aur on another machine
<egasimus>	but can't seem to copy it over -- even after removing write protection with hdparm
<xyzaffa1r>	mrelendig, http://sprunge.us/asbg
<thrice>	!wiki archiso
<phrik>	thrice: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/archiso
<thrice>	xyzaffa1r: your mirror is outdated, do a pacman -syu
<mrelendig>	egasimus: just copy it to /usr/lib/firmware
<thrice>	extra/imagemagick 6.9.1.0-1
<egasimus>	thrice: thanks, i'll look into that
<xyzaffa1r>	thrice, oh, i haven updated in like a month :)
<mrelendig>	never -sy foobar
<mzgnr>	noone ?  :/
<mrelendig>	mzgnr: helps if you actually tell us what hardware you have, what driver you are using and so on
<smirky>	did someone test the live patching on archlinux with the stock kernel? i don't know anything about it, any info would be nice.
<mzgnr>	mrelendig : xf86 ati, i have hd6470m and intel hd 3000
<sheep>	smirky: i haven't seen anything
<mrelendig>	mzgnr: tried using the intel chip?
<mzgnr>	mrelendig : yes i did. but same :/
<thrice>	it's definitely a software problem?  that is, does the older kernel not have the problem?
<smirky>	sheep: do you know what would be the right term to reference it with, linux kernel live patching || kpatch || kgraft ?
<sheep>	smirky: linux 4.0 live patching?
<smirky>	sheep: why 4.0, it's present since 4.0, it's not like it's worth mentioning the version
<sheep>	smirky: there were other live patching systems developed well before 4.0 that never caught on or were merged into mainline
<sheep>	smirky: i have no idea if this requires any changes in the way arch packages the kernel
<smirky>	sheep: exactly, not merged means not worthy, so we talk about mainline only :)
<sheep>	smirky: but if you search for linux live patching, it will likely bring up those unmerged patches
<smirky>	sheep: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kgraft
<phrik>	title: kgraft - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (at en.wikipedia.org)
<smirky>	sheep: they call it kgraft here
<smirky>	sheep: and it's mentioned regarding the 4.0 merging
<pid1>	smirky, what are you trying to accomplish with live patching? do you have a server where a reboot would be an unacceptable service outage?
<smirky>	so i guess it's the official name?
<namarrgon>	zgrep livepatch /proc/config.gz
<sheep>	smirky: there's also kpatch.
<smirky>	pid1: knowledge
<sheep>	smirky: both had a lot of code merged into the kernel
<pid1>	^
<smirky>	so they are two mechanisms implemented and merged into the kernel?
<smirky>	hm
<sheep>	it's enabled in the stock kernel, but that doesn't mean it will actually be usable
<pid1>	the current live patching implementation takes parts from both projects. the kernel mailing list has all the info you need.
<sheep>	two mechanisms that have the same low level code iirc
<smirky>	i'm just curious, it it like a protocol, which third party apps are going to use and patch the system or it's the same for everybody
<sheep>	i doubt that the userspace part is done yet
<sheep>	it will probably require arch's maintainers to generate patches or binary diffs between kernel updates
<smirky>	yes, the pacman issue is going to be interesting
<sheep>	that might require some major changes to the infrastructure the developers use
<namarrgon>	livepatching is not going to replace kexec or a reboot any time soon
<namarrgon>	so there is no pacman issue
<sheep>	livepatching also has the problem of what it does when you skip updates
<smirky>	well now there isn't
<smirky>	but in time, people would want that
<demize>	why would that have anything to do with pacman?
<sheep>	e.g. 4.1.1 comes out, you install that, then arch releases 4.1.2, you skip it, and you want to upgrade to 4.1.3 after it comes out
<smirky>	cause pacman doesn't really apply patches, rather than overwrite all
<pid1>	what?
<smirky>	i guess?
<sheep>	yeah
<demize>	smirky: it never would, and that is irrelevant
<smirky>	demize: then how would the patches be applied and the version get bumped?
<demize>	how arch packages kernels is unrelated to pacman.
<zagabar>	hello. i ran pacman -syu on my laptop (i updated last time maybe a week or two ago) and during the update the screen got black, with occassional very brief flashings of the desktop. i gave it some minutes and then force shut off the computer. now during boot in the main terminal where it shows the loadning stuff it never gets to a login prompt and i never get a graphical environemnt up
<sheep>	it's something that makes more sense for distributions like debian or red hat where the kernel is updated infrequently but it's used in servers that can't go down
<demize>	/you/ would do the patching manually anyway.
<earnestly>	smirky: we've had kgraft and kslice for ages, why weren't all distros using one or the other before "now"?
<demize>	not that it will ever be something that everyone do anyway.
<demize>	it's a really brittle thing.
<zagabar>	and if i switch to another terminal and try running xinit, then it fails with "cannot open /dev/tty0 no such file or directory
<earnestly>	smirky: the media reporting of "never reboot" is a bit sensationalist
<pid1>	earnestly, a lot were. people are just excited because it got merged into mainline.
<smirky>	earnestly: because of mainline not accepting it?
<sheep>	zagabar: did you try startx instead of xinit?
<smirky>	pid1: yes, something like that
<pid1>	which is stupid
<zagabar>	sheep: oh i did just then actually and i get some simple windows up and running. so maybe it's not x, but something else
<pid1>	if you needed live patching you were already using it.
<earnestly>	the merge unified the api both used
<braindamage>	for things like load dispatchers it makes a lot of sense
<smirky>	so you're telling me that pacman isn't going to handle version bumping nor patching in any way for the future?
<braindamage>	which are generally the critical point of failure that can't be brought down
<namarrgon>	nothing will change for arch
<zagabar>	sheep: when i boot the machine, the last thing it stops at is "started user manager for uid 120". maybe that is the last thing, i dunno but it usually boots up gdm automatically
<smirky>	which actually makes sence, cause arch is not really a server distro, not that it can't be used for such. so why bother working on a never-reboot-system
<demize>	smirky: i'm telling you that 1) it's not something that should be done automatically. 2) pacman will not specifically support it because there's no reason for it to.
<phre4k>	[x-post from ##linux] can you help with my samba issue? https://paste.kde.org/pu3df8igj (touching a test file –  the user ids on the servers always differ from the client's user ids)
<phrik>	title: kde paste (at paste.kde.org)
<smirky>	demize: so the situation that uname is going to pop with a linux 5.0 one day and pacman -q linux would report a 4.0 is quite possible?
<namarrgon>	"pop"
<demize>	smirky: why would it be?
<smirky>	?
<smirky>	if i decide to patch it manually, that's why
<namarrgon>	you won't be able to patch 4.x.y to 5.x.y anytime soon
<smirky>	it was a random thought
<smirky>	not a perfect example
<smirky>	but still, why not
<demize>	you wouldn't be able to patch that far anyway since it would touch a huge part of the kernel
<demize>	anyway
<demize>	the question still doesn't really make sense. if you don't update the linux package it won't be updated, that should be pretty obvious.
<smirky>	you're telling me that the live patching can't patch every part of the kernel
<mrelendig>	we should rewrite the kernel in erlang
<namarrgon>	please do some research
<smirky>	namarrgon: me?
<namarrgon>	yes. these questions are all over the lkml, there are articles in all major magazines now. even wikipedia should have something decent to read.
<pid1>	^
<smirky>	ok, but i asked a lot of arch specific things above too, so it's not like that's written somewhere
<smirky>	but i got most of them answered, so...
<namarrgon>	you wouldn't ask these questions if you'd read up on the basics
<demize>	learn the basics before you as... ^ that.
<meteorhead>	hello!
<meteorhead>	i've installed archlinux; great experience so far but i have a question; on boot, i notice a message saying mount real_root
<mrelendig>	meteorhead: that is normal
<meteorhead>	but it disappears as systemd messages scroll
<meteorhead>	mrelendig, ah that's cool then, thanks :)
<oxdb>	i have accounts for [aur,bbs,bugs].archlinux.org ... do i need another one for wiki.archlinux.org or can i re-use credentials from one of the others?
<mrelendig>	oxdb: there is no shared accounts
<mrelendig>	because reasons
<oxdb>	ok. :)
<mrelendig>	we really should just use persona for everything
<mrelendig>	but that would mean having to patch in support for it in all the seperate projects
<mrelendig>	we should add u2f support too :/
<oxdb>	well... i'll just create another account. not a showstopper.
<smirky>	persona?
<smirky>	is that a project of some sort

<mrelendig>	wish it supported u2f
<demize>	sadly mozilla doesn't have any people working on it anymore.
<demize>	mrelendig: well, that would be up to the idp to support
<smirky>	so it's a matter of what supports it i guess
<smirky>	phpbb and stuff
<demize>	so you could implement it yourself
<mixedcase>	hey, does anyone know how long will plasma 5.3 stay in testing?
<mrelendig>	!when
<phrik>	when it's ready.
<mixedcase>	thank you for the elegant may-may chap, i tip my fedora to you.
<mixedcase>	but if anyone has got any news from plasma's maintainer, i'd appreciate it. testing's package is still at -1
<egasimus>	okay, so, still trying to install arch on hp 550 with bcm4312
<egasimus>	decided not to go with archiso for the time being
<egasimus>	instead found a spare usb drive, built b43-firmware from aur on another machine, copied it over, and installed with pacman -u
<egasimus>	still can't see my wifi interface in ip addr though
<xyzaffa1r>	guys
<mrelendig>	egasimus: as i said, just copy the firmware to /usr/lib/firmware
<namarrgon>	egasimus: you built it for the same kernel that the iso uses?
<xyzaffa1r>	mrelendig, recompiled, same error: openspades: error while loading shared libraries: libglew.so.1.11: cannot open shared object file: no such file or directory
<namarrgon>	oh, just the firmware. nvm
<egasimus>	mrelendig, okay, will try that next
<egasimus>	mrelendig: pacman -ql b43-firmware shows that the firmware has already been copied there
<egasimus>	i have the b43/ucode5.fw that could not be found at boot
<mrelendig>	did you reload b43?
<egasimus>	with modprobe b43?
<mrelendig>	modprobe -r first
<egasimus>	yayyyyyy
<pid1>	mixedcase, reach out to the maintainer and take a look at the bug tracker.
<egasimus>	mrelendig, that worked, thanks : ))

<jcelerier>	hi :)
<jcelerier>	i have a question about a package that i would like to make for the aur
<jcelerier>	i want to package a software whose architecture is based on plug-ins
<jcelerier>	(there is a thin glue layer and then about 10 shared libraries)
<earnestly>	jcelerier: make them makedepends and mark them as optional
<jcelerier>	mhh... they aren't actually optional, they make the bulk of the software
<jcelerier>	it's just that they are built as shared objects
<earnestly>	jcelerier: e.g. https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/wl/wlc-git/pkgbuild
<jcelerier>	(the software without the plugins would be a window without any buttons)
<jcelerier>	(just a blank window to stare)
<earnestly>	wait, does the software itself build these shared objects?
<jcelerier>	yes
<earnestly>	then what's what problem
<jcelerier>	it's all in a single repository
<jcelerier>	i just wonder where i should put them
<jcelerier>	the software expects to have them in a plugins/ subfolder
<earnestly>	jcelerier: the software should define lookup paths
<jcelerier>	but i guess just dropping them in /usr/bin/plugins would not be a good practice :p
<earnestly>	jcelerier: the software should look in well known locations
<sudokode>	you shouldn't have any directories in /usr/bin
<jcelerier>	so my software is named i-score; would it be okay if i put the shared libraries in /usr/lib/i-score/plugins ?
<jcelerier>	(and the executable in /usr/bin)
<sudokode>	yes, that's where'd you put any binaries you don't want in path
<sudokode>	(/usr/lib that is)
<earnestly>	jcelerier: yes, /usr/lib/<program_name>/... is fine
<jcelerier>	okay! thanks then.
<earnestly>	jcelerier: orbment for example is also based on plugins like this; checks xdg_data_home/orbment/plugins after /usr/lib/orbment/plugins
<earnestly>	jcelerier: http://ix.io/igv
<jcelerier>	earnestly: perfect!
<earnestly>	jcelerier: debian has libexec/ nonsense, but nevermind that
<jcelerier>	oh and this is nice to have a consistent naming scheme
<a1ynx>	if i've got a blank fstab, can i reset it by using the live medium, re-mounting all partitions and the just run genfstab again?
<jcelerier>	earnestly: yep, i come from a debian background but i couldn't event start comprehending how to build packages for it
<jcelerier>	arch is soooo simple in comparison
<jcelerier>	it's a breeze
<earnestly>	it really is
<sudokode>	jcelerier: arch just follows fhs for the most part
<earnestly>	jcelerier: just to show you that, see https://gist.github.com/earnestly/bebad057f40a662b5cc3
<phrik>	title: a brief overview of the process involved in creating a pacman package. (at gist.github.com)
<namarrgon>	a1ynx: are you already using the system?
<earnestly>	sudokode: do keep in mind that fhs is a redhat thing
<sudokode>	there is some license, but it shouldn't effect anything
<a1ynx>	namarrgon: yes i am
<earnestly>	see systemd-path(1) or read file-hierarchy(7) for systemd's opinion on it.
<sudokode>	earnestly: thought fhs was an lsb thing
<sudokode>	does redhat run lsb?
<earnestly>	sudokode: yeah
<namarrgon>	a1ynx: then you can just run gen-fstab if all your partitions are mounted, or just write the fstab manually
<jcelerier>	s
<earnestly>	jcelerier: the end of the gist has a complete script to build a package without makepkg

<sudokode>	then something else is setting it
<wildefyr>	hi, i am currently trying to get mutt and msmtp working to send an email to myself, but when i try, msmpt gives me this error - https://ptpb.pw/pwxt now my gmail password and account are correct so i have no idea how to get it working. also the msmtp config file is under /etc atm
<statelesscat>	/home/raphael/.config/plasma-localerc:lang=fr_fr.utf-8
<statelesscat>	this one ?
<sudokode>	that'll do it
<statelesscat>	/home/raphael/.config/plasma-locale-settings.sh:export lang=fr_fr.utf-8 ?
<sudokode>	are you running plasma?
<statelesscat>	yes
<sudokode>	that'd be why
<statelesscat>	and i dont whant french
<sudokode>	change it in plasma then
<sudokode>	not sure how that shit happened
<namarrgon>	people tend to set stuff up and instantly forget about it
<statelesscat>	_echo $lang
<statelesscat>	en_us.utf-8
<sudokode>	woot
<statelesscat>	:)
<statelesscat>	i remember why i set it
<sudokode>	the money?
<statelesscat>	because i if not set it, in plasma, i got hours, date in us format
<sudokode>	that's always the reason
<sudokode>	which date format are you looking for?
<sudokode>	you can create your own locale if you want
<sudokode>	if you can't find one that suits your needs
<statelesscat>	and i'm still french, and more confortable with date in 24h format, with days before month in date... you know with metric instead of imperial :)

<junka>	scimmia; :o

<diegoviola>	will a ssd save energy / power consumption on a laptop?
<diegoviola>	or not necessarily
<tom^>	diegoviola: neglible differences
<arch-tk>	tom^: no skype
<sheep>	it will probably use a lot less energy since there are no moving parts
<tom^>	arch-tk: skype master race
<sheep>	but i could be wrong
<arch-tk>	tom^: no
<junka>	( it produces encrypted traffic even when you are not actively using skype. 0
<diegoviola>	tom^: right
<sheep>	ssd+hdd would probably use about the same amount
<diegoviola>	tom^: last time when i swapped my hdd for my ssd, arch was still as fast
<tom^>	junka: you are still running skype when that happends.
<sheep>	junka: how much of that is just keepalives and setting or querying status?
<diegoviola>	tom^: i heard people notice a difference with windows though
<clarjon1>	junka: of course it does, how else does it know when people go onilne/offline/change status/incoming messages/etc?
<junka>	i don't know. i just query the wiki :p

<earnestly>	tom^: y no mumble?
<tom^>	same reason as above.
<junka>	^
<arch-tk>	tom^: ah, teamspeak is like the mother of all baby duck syndrome
<earnestly>	i don't know much about mumble though
<arch-tk>	"oh my, but mumble is different and i've only ever used ts so mumble must be shit"
<clarjon1>	and, skype is working!
<junka>	gamers usually use mumble
<wildefyr>	i actually prefer ts to mumble, mumble is hard to get people to use
<tom^>	^
<holomorph>	why :|
<arch-tk>	what the fuck.
<tom^>	i dont know why, but it just is.
<sheep>	mumble's access control is weird
<wildefyr>	because it's fuck ugly
<wildefyr>	that's why
<arch-tk>	*sigh*
<wildefyr>	that too sheep

<sheep>	*might*

<vodik>	huh, how much does that cost you?
<cloudef>	free
<vodik>	asking because i'm considering setting it up for me stuff
<cloudef>	it's running on some friend's server
<vodik>	*my stuff
<vodik>	oh
<vodik>	hah
<jza>	anyone know the package name for telepathy-chat on arch
<cloudef>	though servers in general are quite cheap nowadays
<tom^>	~400€
<earnestly>	you can probably use some simple ec2 instance for free
<p67>	hi all. i'm trying to install a desktop running both an intel gpu and a nvidia card. early kms does not seem to work as i am getting black screens if i don't use nomodeset. do i need to use the nouveau driver to enable early kms or does the proprietary driver support this as well?
<sheep>	jza: you want the actual empathy client, right?  not just the telepathy framework?
<vodik>	!give p67 wiki bumblebee
<phrik>	p67: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/bumblebee
<tom^>	p67: and which card is the monitor plugged into?
<tom^>	vodik: desktop, not laptop :p
<arch-tk>	on a scale of 1 to 0
<p67>	tom^: nvidia card
<vodik>	oh
<vodik>	right
<jza>	sheep: that's the confusing part, i use kopete but i read that kde did a release of telepathy chat, but i get too many telepathy packages but no 'telepathy-chat'
<tom^>	p67: which gpu
<jza>	sheep: empathy is a gnome cliengt
<p67>	uff, i thought it was a 560gti
<tom^>	p67: but yes to use kms you need nouveau, however it might not be supported on your card
<vodik>	jza: look at the optional dependancies
<tom^>	p67: i would just use the nvidia blob and be done with it.
<sheep>	jza: maybe they named it something else
<p67>	tom^: and use nomodeset?
<tom^>	p67: yes
<jza>	sheep: thats the question :)
<jza>	well i will go to their project and see their actual package name and start from there.
<vodik>	jza: empathy's opt-depends: optional deps  : telepathy-gabble: xmpp/jabber support
<vodik>	                 telepathy-idle: irc support
<vodik>	                 telepathy-salut: link-local xmpp support
<vodik>	                 telepathy-rakia: sip support
<vodik>	                 telepathy-haze: libpurple support
<vodik>	fuck
<vodik>	i had a pastebin
<wasamasa>	fuck
<junka>	pls
<p67>	tom^: alright, i was thinking about that too, but maybe there were other things i didn't know existed ;)
<arch-tk>	vodik: kick yourself
<vodik>	http://ix.io/7vg
<earnestly>	you made a point though
<junka>	..
<tom^>	vodik: didnt work, ban yourself.
<vodik>	i hope i learnt my lesson
<vodik>	tom^: im only on strike 2 :(
<arch-tk>	vodik: no, i think you need to kick yourself a few more times.
<jza>	vodik: like i got telepathy-kde-applet, telepathy-kde-integation-module
<earnestly>	jza: there are many more
<vodik>	jza: right, but telepathy has various backends for different protocol
<vodik>	look at what i pasted
<vodik>	telepathy-gabble: xmpp/jabber support
<vodik>	telepathy-rakia: sip support
<arch-tk>	vodik: if you need a server to host on.....
<vodik>	^ different protocols
<earnestly>	vodik: i like the spam, it made a point that "you should read the opt depends"
<sheep>	what are those optional deps for?
<vodik>	arch-tk: getting a personal server is something on my todo list, so thanks, but i'd rather have more reasons not to be lazy about it then less
<vodik>	earnestly: yeah i know
<earnestly>	:p
<jza>	vodik: ok i think this is the definitive package: telepathy-kde-meta
<vodik>	jza: it doesn't install telapathy backends
<jza>	yeah saw that umm..

<lucysan>	how can yaourt or any other aur package manager install packages without root?
<sheep>	lucysan: they can't
<sheep>	they can call sudo or su though, but that requires that the user running the aur helper has access to them
<lucysan>	oh
<lucysan>	i must have had anways sudo with nopasswd
<lucysan>	*always
<earnestly>	pls don't do that
<earnestly>	anyway
<earnestly>	xy problem
<lucysan>	yeah, i know
<tom^>	sudo stores uh your uhm "session" for a while
<vodik>	lucysan: its technically possible, but the real question here is why? since this quite the potential security hole
<lucysan>	but typing password in is pain in the ass
<lucysan>	it defeats "not-runing-as-root" purpose trough
<vodik>	lucysan: make sudo remember your password for longer is one option, so you still have to manually enter it at least once
<lucysan>	yeah
<freaj>	vodik: lol..
<lucysan>	fixed nopasswd ^.^
<vodik>	freaj: yeah, don't do that :p
<vodik>	lucysan: yeah, don't blame us now if someone exploits that hole
<halfwit>	typing in a password is the one pain in the ass we really urge you to learn to live with
<lyonsb>	it seems that sudo's . . . erm . . . temporary password removal is tied to the specific terminal session.
<lucysan>	<lucysan> fixed nopasswd ^.^
<freaj>	vodik: i don't find anywhere to make the screen goes off on lid closing
<lyonsb>	so you have to enter it once to run several sudo commands.  (ie, mfu cache for bash commands, so to speak)
<vodik>	freaj: nvidia in your macbook?
<psi-jack>	grrr... why! why oh why!   something so something that works everywhere else but this..
<jumbers>	freaj: what desktop environment? mate has an option to turn off the screen when closing the lid
<halfwit>	you're like an npc in a game.
<lucysan>	jumbers, almost any has
<lucysan>	and if not `xset dpms force off`
<freaj>	jumbers: lxde
<vodik>	freaj: nvidia?
<freaj>	vodik: i don't think so
<freaj>	lucysan: that's what i do but i don't know how to do it as usual
<vodik>	freaj: does `xset dpms force off` work if typed manually?
<vodik>	i think you should do that next to rule out dpms is broken in the first place
<vodik>	if that doesn't work, the de doesn't matter, it can't turn off the monitor either
<freaj>	vodik: it does

<wasamasa>	cloudef: alternatively, hum, perhaps supporting guile would be an option since it lends itself for embedding
<wasamasa>	cloudef: and you already did experiment with it
<howdoitype>	does arch come with a c++ compiler by default?
<sheep>	howdoitype: no.  install base-devel

<cloudef>	wasamasa: the guile would go in plugin :p
<sudokode>	about once a week

<howdoitype>	sheep so one comes with base-devel?

<jasabella>	sheep... yea, i realise, but i'm doign my homework before jumping in (i.e. reading about arch) and there was something mentioned being about more likely to break something if you wait longer between updates?
<sudokode>	heh
<sheep>	jasabella: absolutely
<caleb>	i dont have comcast i just used it because it did ipv4 and ipv6 speed tests
<caleb>	sudokode: nice speeds

<vodik>	this machine will never recieve any updates
<sudokode>	mhm

<vodik>	this machine has a replacement coming in the mail

<sudokode>	you all could build a megacity with free gigabit internet
<halfwit>	mostly due to fuck toronto
<sudokode>	lol
<tom^>	sweden is a 9 million strong.
<tom^>	how many lives in toronto?
<sudokode>	that would also make it too easy for the rest of the world
<sudokode>	we'd all be like... hey, canada's just a city-state now...
<halfwit>	!g population of toronto
<phrik>	halfwit: toronto - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toronto>
<sudokode>	oregan trail 2.0

<tom^>	"which is home to 8,686,923 people"
<kaligne>	hi guys! i have an archlinux partition and an ubuntu one. from arch i downloaded and installed windows manager xmonad. i can naturally use it in arch. but now i can also select to log in  my ubuntu account using xmonad. is that normal? i didn't expect arch xmonad to work on another partition?
<tom^>	right so toronto has almost as many people as our country has.
<tom^>	:p
<halfwit>	that's awesome, lol
<sheep>	kaligne: are arch and ubuntu using the same partition for /home?
<freaj>	vodik: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/acpid#laptop_monitor_power_off worked for me :-)
<phrik>	title: acpid - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<jasabella>	what kind of breakages are typically encountered if you neglect updating? is it dependencies?
<sudokode>	tom^: lol your country is basically just a loose collection of viking families
<tom^>	sudokode: with gigabit internets in our elk hide tents.
<kaligne>	sheep: nope. each one has its own /home
<halfwit>	deal with it, lol
<sudokode>	priorities
<sheep>	jasabella: occasionally it's dependencies, but there's also stuff like pacman not tracking symlinks, needing to run pacman-db-upgrade, glibc dropping support for older kernels
<sheep>	jasabella: or major groups of packages being restructured (like kde)
<jasabella>	oh so things move around hmmm
<sudokode>	sometimes
<sudokode>	and when they do, there's generally a big alert somewhere
<sudokode>	that will give you very detailed instructions on how to not break your system
<sudokode>	along with 2 blog posts explaining how to unbreak your system
<sudokode>	unless you can't read, arch shouldn't be a problem
<jasabella>	i'm a bit confused as to why i need a /var to store old packages... does arch not keep a repository of old stuff?
<tom^>	jasabella: nope
<jasabella>	ahhh i see
<sudokode>	your package cache will contain old versions of any package downloaded
<mpdavis73>	even if they did, you want a local pkg to downgrade to if your network breaks
<mpdavis73>	or worse
<kaligne>	well ubuntu dpkg shows xmonad is installed. perhaps i did install it on both partitions but i have abslutely no recollection, and i discovered xmonad few days ago so that is weird.
<sudokode>	which you can either keep around or clean out
<sudokode>	mpdavis73: it's not always that simple
<spectralsun>	i'm having troubles updating; some conflicts with sage mathematics: https://pastebin.osuosl.org/26161/
<phrik>	title: #26161 • osl pastebin (at pastebin.osuosl.org)
<vodik>	!give jasabella arm
<phrik>	jasabella: arch rollback machine. a 3rd party repository for old packages. see https://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-general/2013-september/034094.html
<mpdavis73>	true, but you do want local copies of your last working pkgs
<vodik>	jasabella: but its unofficial
<sheep>	spectralsun: you should probably answer 'y' to that conflict
<tom^>	wtf is blackarch
<sudokode>	say foo is linked against libbar. libbar and foo are upgraded together. if you didn't have an old copy of libbar sitting around, you couldn't downgrade foo
<holomorph>	tom^: 3rdp repo of netsec type stuff
<vodik>	spectralsun: what did you answer to those questions?
<tom^>	hm ok
<jasabella>	i wonder if filesystem snapshots would help
<vodik>	jasabella: before updates? yeah, totally
<mpdavis73>	usually easier to fix the issue with the upgrade than downgrade, except for trivial pkgs
<sheep>	backups are never bad
<scimmia>	spectralsun, what did you expect when you accepted the default on that last question?
<sheep>	though 99% of the time you can fix a broken upgrade
<vodik>	jasabella: but yeah, i think its either a little to paranoid or you already need filesystem snapshots for other reasons
<jasabella>	hehehe ok
<sudokode>	mpdavis73: yeah it much easier if the deps are small
<jasabella>	but typically with arch, you only install and care about the stuff you use, you dont get cruft like with other distros and/or their desktop environments
<jasabella>	right?
<mpdavis73>	if upgrading is the only reason you back up, you are doing it worng
<sudokode>	mpdavis73: like you could rebuild libbar yourself. the old version of it
<vodik>	jasabella: pacman does a damn good job of refusing to update stuff that will do serious damnage to the package management
<sudokode>	it's almost trivial as long as the deps it needs aren't versioned
<jasabella>	ooohh neat
<mpdavis73>	as opposed to lobfoo? lol
<sheep>	jasabella: right, but you can still accumulate cruft.  the difference with arch is that it doesn't come with cruft by default
<vodik>	jasabella: you only really have to worry about either your stupidness or a regression in particular piece of software
<sudokode>	then you could downgrade foo based off of that
<mpdavis73>	libfoo*
<sheep>	i probably have about 500 packages i never use, but this install dates back to mid-2011
<jasabella>	i got plenty of stupids :d
<sudokode>	lol sure
<vodik>	jasabella: which you can just install the old version back on, so yeah, snapshots can be a nice safety net, but at the same time, are on the 'very paranoid' side of things
<sheep>	wait.  i have gnome and kde and xfce and lxde installed, but i use i3.  i am doing arch entirely wrong.
<sudokode>	this is why it pays off to learn about arch packages
<jasabella>	is removing packages easy? :)
<mpdavis73>	is not as bad as changing glibc in lfs..heh
<vodik>	jasabella: yes
<sudokode>	it's no excuse not to either since they're relatively easy to work with
<spectralsun>	oh weird, its working now
<jasabella>	i'm used to debian-based systems (incl. debian itself) and want to learn abut worried about learning curve, but want to learn at the same time... in a weird place
<spectralsun>	sheep, vodik, scimmia: i thought i had tried y, i realize in my paste i didnt. it's going now... derp...
<spectralsun>	thanks
<vodik>	heh
<jasabella>	maybe i'm jumping in too deep and should go for something like fedora instead
<scimmia>	jasabella, there is always the dual boot option
<jasabella>	yea
<vodik>	jasabella: nah, i'd rather suggest you're overthinking and overwrorrying
<sudokode>	jasabella: through the looking glass
<sheep>	jasabella: have you ever used debian unstable?
<sudokode>	fedora is actually super annoying to use if you start with arch
<vodik>	jasabella: but pick what you think its best for you
<mpdavis73>	arch has better documentation
<sudokode>	!wiki pacman rosetta
<phrik>	sudokode: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman_rosetta
<scimmia>	arch isn't for everyone, but you don't know until you try
<freaj>	jasabella: hi, i've been using debian derivatives for a while, arch is more manual, but if you're used to debian for example, arch will be fine for you!
<freaj>	jasabella: also, it has a huge documentation :p
<tom^>	mpdavis73: i dont ever backup and never have in the ~16 years ive used computers.
<mpdavis73>	tom^: insanity wolf..lol
<scimmia>	tom^, that's it, you're about to have a major system crash
<sheep>	tom^: reminds me of when i screwed up my mbr with dd and was only able to salvage it because i had a copy of the mbr saved from when i dumped grub for syslinux
<mpdavis73>	either you have lost data, or will lose data
<tom^>	the thing is i dont work with computers and really dont have any work related things on it.
<sheep>	it's amazing how destroying 512 bytes makes a disk useless
<tom^>	so if shit goes bork its just pirated and/or games which can easily be restored
<sheep>	also, mbr totally sucks.  gpt has built in redundancy
<mpdavis73>	found the hard way that with winblows, uefi==gpt and bios==mbr
<tom^>	and i mean sure losing the configs in ~ would be boring, but fun too. maybe i could try some new wm's and what not.
<mpdavis73>	had to dual boot my system76 and had my gpt partitions all nice and set up, then tried to install win8 for work
<sudokode>	you can use gpt with bios on windows as long as you boot from a disk with an mbr
<sudokode>	the system partition has to match gpt/uefi or mbr/bios
<mpdavis73>	only had 1 disk at the time
<sudokode>	well yeah that'd be your system drive then
<sudokode>	s/partition/drive/
<mpdavis73>	added a 750gb wd black since
<sudokode>	wd blacks are awesome
<tom^>	wd blacks are unkillable
<sudokode>	too bad they're so expensive
<sudokode>	yeah, i still have my 500gb
<mpdavis73>	i have 2 greens for my zfs mirror
<sudokode>	ran my root/home on it since i got it until i got an ssd
<sudokode>	greens are fuckin terrible
<sudokode>	intellipower is shit if you want performance
<mpdavis73>	tigerdirect was closing here and they were 25% off
<sudokode>	yeah, they're okay for mass storage
<sudokode>	great if you get them cheap
<sudokode>	but wds are still prone to failure
<mpdavis73>	yeah, just tv shows for plex and backup files mostly
<sudokode>	i'm using an hgst now
<scimmia>	i've had wd blacks go bad. any disk will die eventually
<sudokode>	owned by wd, but somehow still better
<sudokode>	well yeah, but wd blacks seem to outlast them all
<sudokode>	hitachis were nice too, now they're hgst
<sudokode>	haven't had any issues with this 4tb drive though
<jasabella>	wd blue is my backup :/
<mpdavis73>	is why mione are mirrored - have been thru ~5 disks with this zfs pool
<sudokode>	black > blue > purple > red > green

<mpdavis73>	tarsnap :) 3 copies, 2 locations = 1 good backup
<tom^>	its outlasted many computers heh
<sudokode>	tom^: it should get at least 5 years cause the blacks have a 5 year warranty
<sudokode>	theoretically anyway
<tom^>	sudokode: it does? hm
<sudokode>	yeah. blacks still have the longest warranty of any consumer drive
<sudokode>	except the ssds that come with 10 years
<tom^>	not bad, i got 3 1tb blacks, and 2 ssds and this oldass 320gb one
<tom^>	gonna last for a while then
<sudokode>	1tb blacks are expensive too
<tom^>	indeed
<arch-tk>	i need to find some offsite backup place.
<tom^>	arch-tk: to the cloud!
<sudokode>	but if you want 3tb storage pool that'll last a while, that's probably the best way to go
<arch-tk>	tom^: fuck no.
<sheep>	sudokode: i got one for $97 a few years ago.  how much is it now?
<sheep>	a 1tb black
<sudokode>	we'll see how long this 4tb hgst lasts
<mpdavis73>	tarsnap - love it so far - may be $$$ for a lot of data
<sudokode>	sheep: that's expensive for 1tb :p
<tom^>	arch-tk: to the microsoft backup cloud!
<sheep>	dang
<arch-tk>	tom^:  fuckedy fuck no
<sheep>	it has a 6-year-out-of-date arch install on it
<sudokode>	sheep: i mean that's the normal price of a black roughly
<tom^>	sheep: its time to -syu
<sudokode>	but if you figure you can get a blue for maybe half the price
<mpdavis73>	velociraptor - lol
<arch-tk>	tom^: that would probably kill it.
<earnestly>	tom^: it would probably work too
<tom^>	you two contradict eachother now.
<sheep>	tom^: that was before systemd was even available.  the glibc update will kill it and it still has to deal witj the /usr/bin and /usr/lib merges
<tom^>	!fight arch-tk earnestly
<earnestly>	you /may/ have to -syu from a live iso though
<phrik>	tom^: arch-tk: 883000, earnestly: 568000
<arch-tk>	i win
<earnestly>	just so you can use pacman without /lib for a moment
<tom^>	earnestly: thats not so bad idea tbh
<arch-tk>	earnestly: when did arch switch over to systemd?
<sheep>	i'll probably just copy arch onto some magnetic tapes, wipe the partition off the disc, and install templeos on it

<sudokode>	doesn't have the warranties on there actually, but the blue is 3 years i think

<mpdavis73>	lumina..heh
<earnestly>	jasabelle: yes, we have lots of them
<jasabelle>	ew emacs :d
<earnestly>	jasabelle: you're a bit like a broken record, do you have any unique thoughts of your own?
<random-nick>	i wonder if someone made a distro all around emacs
<thrice>	does emacs support wayland?
<wasamasa>	earnestly: now i have an earworm
<earnestly>	random-nick: probably, although i've not seen one, hm.  there is a proof of concept where emacs (with the help of /bin/mount) runs alone on a linux kernel
<wasamasa>	thrice: of course not
<wasamasa>	thrice: you can use it via xwayland though
<earnestly>	same with vim
<jasabelle>	earnestly... i'm new :p
<earnestly>	jasabelle: then forget the "emacs" this or that bullshit until you know for yourself
<random-nick>	earnestly: there is also a theory about how uefi could run emacs without an os
<jasabelle>	earnestly... i'm a vim user
<earnestly>	random-nick: you can run quake on uefi without an os, uefi is larger than the kernel core
<earnestly>	jasabelle: so?
<jasabelle>	but yea, hence the ":d", it wasnt meant to be taken seriously :p
<earnestly>	jasabelle: you have no idea how tedious it gets
<jasabelle>	okie, sorry
<earnestly>	(yes, i use vim mostly)
<random-nick>	i just use kate as a text editor, but i am not really a programmer
<earnestly>	both vim and emacs are sorely needing rewrites.  they have so many dark corners (kernighan) and legacy.  emacs has been cloned in the form of virtually every other editor out there, vi/m hasn't really very much outside of a few old ones
<random-nick>	but when i was doing something with c i used kate's konsole integration
<earnestly>	vim is some of the slowest, most horrid c89 code out there
<jasabelle>	i dont care what you use, juts do something with it :d
<random-nick>	earnestly: is it slower than python?
<earnestly>	jasabelle: you should probably care about the tools you use, since they dictate what you can do
<jasabelle>	haha stallman
<jasabelle>	i agree with that
<earnestly>	random-nick: you could implement vim in python (assuming the official implementation of python) and it will be just as fast, yes.
<pessimist>	languages don't have speeds
<earnestly>	random-nick: yi, which is written in haskell, and supports both styles of editting is faster
<wasamasa>	thrice: there's an unfinished attempt by someone at creating a cairo backend, but it's pretty slow currently and not decoupled from all the xorgisms
<earnestly>	pessimist: yes, they very much do
<pessimist>	their implementations do
<earnestly>	no
<wasamasa>	pessimist: there are languages that are nearly impossible to get fast
<wasamasa>	pessimist: thanks to their design
<pessimist>	nope, i can write a c implementation that is slow as ****
<nizumzen>	pypy is a nice speed up over the standard python implementation
<random-nick>	wasamasa: for example python and java
<wasamasa>	pessimist: it took generations of vm engineers to have an acceptably fast javascript interpreter, yet it's still all weird
<earnestly>	the point isn't about how slow you can make something.  that's easy, just put a call to sleep for a million years between each instruction
<random-nick>	wasamasa: these aren't all that fast
<nizumzen>	random-nick: try pypy
<wasamasa>	pessimist: that kind of thing could have been avoided, really
<pessimist>	the point is that the implementation of any language can be as slow as much as you like it to independently of the actual language
<earnestly>	pessimist: read some of the dragon book and perhaps types and programming languages
<earnestly>	pessimist: there's also a ton of books referenced there
<earnestly>	pessimist: yes, but ... sigh.
<random-nick>	i wonder did some make a c interpreter in c
<wasamasa>	pessimist: going as slow as you like isn't the goal at all
<earnestly>	random-nick: yes, cling.  it's not very good.
<wasamasa>	pessimist: our goal is doing better, damnit
<pessimist>	wasamasa: it doesn't have to be on purpose
<wasamasa>	pessimist: of course not, python and ruby and php and perl weren't designed that crappily on purpose
<earnestly>	pessimist: the real world is usually less forgiving
<spbogie>	i think the proper argument is that languages aren't inherently fast, but they can be inherently slow
<earnestly>	where designs do matter, and there are designs which are mathematically impossible to make fast
<earnestly>	i.e. optimisations can't make guarantees
<wasamasa>	yet here we are, with engineers at facebook toiling away at making their tons of php run sufficiently fast
<earnestly>	why do you think c has so much undefined behaviour?
<pessimist>	i'd guess to allow a lot of freedom in implementation
<hannibal_smith>	wasamasa, thinking about it, in fb case what is a "sufficiently fast" php implementation? is not an easy question imho
<earnestly>	pessimist: languages which only rely on recursion *must* be able to guarantee tce, programmers have to usualyl go out of their way to help the compiler, because cpus do not understand recusion, they understand loops.
<wasamasa>	hannibal_smith: hhvm is about twice as fast as the official zend implementation, thank you
<random-nick>	isn't facebook's "optimizing" of php just translating into a cgi c application?

<wasamasa>	hannibal_smith: and as for the question how to decide that, wikipedia decided to switch over to it to spend less on servers
<earnestly>	pessimist: tail call elimintion
<wasamasa>	pessimist: tail-call elimination
<wasamasa>	pessimist: what languages like haskell and scheme do
<earnestly>	a lot of cps languages need it
<hannibal_smith>	wasamasa, the question is more "is this implementation really fast enough?"

<phrik>	title: how we made editing wikipedia twice as fast « wikimedia blog (at blog.wikimedia.org)
<earnestly>	pessimist: then consider the design of languages like k
<random-nick>	what's k?
<wasamasa>	hannibal_smith: they keep working on it because there isn't such a thing as being ever fast enough for them :p
<earnestly>	pessimist: it's interpeted, but almost as fast as c or as fast
<hannibal_smith>	wasamasa, yes it's because that, that i find it an interesting question
<earnestly>	pessimist: because it makes extremely effecient use of data locality, being an array based language
<earnestly>	pessimist: the entire thing almost never leaves the cpu caches
<earnestly>	pessimist: they use it at banks like morgan stanely for their databases and it absolutely blows away everything else out there
<wasamasa>	hannibal_smith: but still, a widely known website a lot of us relying on switching implementations (despite already having a pretty well working caching solution) is interesting to me
<earnestly>	pessimist: look into mlkit in what it does for standard ml
<hannibal_smith>	wasamasa, i think that with hack, they can actually do optimization that are not possible with only php, like asmjs case
<wasamasa>	hannibal_smith: perhaps, my impression so far was that it makes developing such huge codebases possible
<hannibal_smith>	wasamasa, yes for sure productivity is the main mission of hack
<jasabelle>	hmmm
<pessimist>	first time i've heard about k :d
<earnestly>	hannibal_smith: i hate the "developers must be 100% productive" crap.  you always find them saying stupid things like "cpu time is less important than developer time"
<earnestly>	hannibal_smith: what exactly is "cpu time"?  you might wonder.  it's just the dehumanising name given to users
<earnestly>	!machinesympathy
<phrik>	http://traffic.libsyn.com/seradio/se-radioepisode201-martinthompson.mp3
<grawity>	okay, what.
<earnestly>	pessimist: ^ is nice too
<grawity>	no, honestly
<hannibal_smith>	earnestly, i learned that performance is part of the specification of a problem
<grawity>	this rant has reached critical levels of i don't even
<thrice>	agreed
<hannibal_smith>	so if your code is too slow respect to the "specification", you are not solving the problem
<earnestly>	hannibal_smith: yeah, certainly
<tom^>	what did i miss :o
<grawity>	'"cpu time" is the dehumanising name given to users'?
<earnestly>	grawity: yes
<thrice>	pessimist left hours ago, i think
<grawity>	how the hell does that make sense
<hannibal_smith>	earnestly, i think that probably the real problem is the lack of specification when writing something
<earnestly>	grawity: because it's used to justify bad programming that wastes user time
<hannibal_smith>	if you don't have a specification, you don't have clear the problem to solve
<earnestly>	grawity: a task that could take seconds now take minutes because a developer needed to spend 5 hours less time to write some bad code
<hannibal_smith>	you can do anything you like, and be correct
<earnestly>	that task has to run hundreds of times across millions of users machines
<earnestly>	the justification of "cpu time" is used to mask this impact by trying to make it a pejorative
<hannibal_smith>	earnestly, but as cs student, i have a problem more with this kind of approach "write first code, than optimize"
<hannibal_smith>	at least from my little experience, is not possible
<earnestly>	hannibal_smith: well, if you get the data structures right, that's usually the most optimisation you'll need.  for the rest one has to just measure and work more like a scientist to find the rest.
<thrice>	why does it matter how long it takes for people to program things?
<tom^>	because some does it at work
<tom^>	and time is money.
<earnestly>	thrice: because the faster they program the quicker some company can ship a product
<thrice>	every company i've worked has never put strict time schedules on my work
<thrice>	nor anyone i know personally
<earnestly>	thrice: doing cad work?
<hannibal_smith>	earnestly, personally i tend to think like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx0itvevjhc
<thrice>	doing any work
<earnestly>	thrice: perhaps it's just a silicon valley startup thing
<hannibal_smith>	and in the end, he think the same as you earnestly
<braindamage>	several development patterns altough try to somewhat enforce redular checkpoints tough
<braindamage>	such as the agile's scrums
<earnestly>	hannibal_smith: this came up recently: http://www.benstopford.com/2015/04/28/elements-of-scale-composing-and-scaling-data-platforms/
<phrik>	title: elements of scale: composing and scaling data platforms - ben stopford (at www.benstopford.com)
<braindamage>	even just as peer pressure to have something more to show as "still working"
<tazmain>	in #pulseaudio
<namarrgon>	no, this is #archlinux
<namarrgon>	try next door
<thrice>	earnestly: your bosses keep honest time expectations?  i'm not justifying slow activity, but i think the point is also a bit extreme
<earnestly>	thrice: *shrug*, it's a bit of a meme at this point in programming, as braindamage mentioned.
<earnestly>	it might be a minority as well, with blogs
<gschanuel>	hi folks. i'm trying to turn my laptop screen off when i close it's lid. i have changed handlelidswitch to lock in /etc/systemd/logind.conf just for testing, but it do not lock.  journalctl shows systemd-logind "lid closed". so i was wondering, where can i change this behaviour?
<grawity>	"lock" and "turn screen off" aren't the same thing...
<grawity>	which one are you trying to ask about?
<earnestly>	thrice: (it's not always the programmers fault either (they should profile though), because high-level languages these days seem to be designed without taking into consideration how machines actually work.  you'll typically find fairly non-idiomatic and horrible looking code when performance is sought in them)
<gschanuel>	i want to turn the screen off, but i didn't find that option in  /etc/systemd/logind.conf
<gschanuel>	so i set it to lock just for testing purposes
<grawity>	turning the screen off isn't done by logind
<earnestly>	gschanuel: the default is #handlelidswitch=suspend
<grawity>	it's supposed to be done in all cases, i don't know what is usually responsible for it though
<gschanuel>	grawity, shoud i change it to ignore and do it with acpid?
<grawity>	i was thinking the graphics driver, or xorg
<earnestly>	is there a setterm(1) for blanking in the monitor?
<grawity>	there was, but setterm is tty-specific
<sudokode>	grawity: dpms
<sudokode>	monitor-specific, controllable through x
<grawity>	dpms is the method, but what usually calls it?
<earnestly>	sudokode: that's xset(1)
<grawity>	i mean
<sudokode>	nothing, the monitor does it on its own
<sudokode>	afaik
<earnestly>	which requires an x server to use
<grawity>	yeah,  ithought so too
<sudokode>	you basically trick the monitor into thinking there's activity
<earnestly>	which means you need to know display
<grawity>	but then i've seen people complain that their laptop *doesn't* turn off the screen so x has to do it
<earnestly>	which makes lid reactions a bit trickier
<gschanuel>	i think it could run "xset dpms force off" on lid closed
<sudokode>	hm
<sudokode>	!w dpms
<earnestly>	gschanuel: which requires a display, since an acpid will be running as root and won't have your environment
<phrik>	sudokode: dpms panther arms - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dpms_panther_arms>
<sudokode>	lol wat
<earnestly>	gschanuel: can't a daemon like upower configure a policy more cleanly?
<sudokode>	http://webpages.charter.net/dperr/dpms.htm
<phrik>	title: dpms monitor specification (at webpages.charter.net)
<sudokode>	so it's between the video adapter and the monitor
<hannibal_smith>	earnestly, i got at the begin of "parallelism"...really great talk. interesting enough the approach proposed column oriented also in other kind of applications. in games for example is common to use "array of structure"
<infides>	does someone know if this guide: http://www.pavelkogan.com/2014/05/23/luks-full-disk-encryption/ also works with gpt?
<phrik>	title: full disk encryption with luks (including /boot) · pavel kogan (at www.pavelkogan.com)
<earnestly>	hannibal_smith: computers like arrays (sequential data), can see upwards of 7000x faster writes/reads
<earnestly>	hannibal_smith: to the point where sequential data access on *disks* is faster than random access in memory
<earnestly>	https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1563874
<phrik>	title: the pathologies of big data - acm queue (at queue.acm.org)
<behelit>	stupid question: how do i persist changes made with `iw`? (i.e. disabling power_save, setting reg etc)
<hannibal_smith>	oh sorry, i meant structure of array
<hannibal_smith>	earnestly, for me it's the first time seeing that is actually possible doing an approach like the one illustrated when managin an index
<hannibal_smith>	so using the storage not as "cold memory"
<earnestly>	hannibal_smith: whatever names we give it, it's just sequential access.  you keep the cache line hot, the page cache current, the disk cache current and the pre-fetcher happy.
<grawity>	behelit: udev rules for power saving, /etc/conf.d/wireless-regdom (crda) for the regdom.
<hannibal_smith>	i don't think that aside from db engine, having seen this in other kind of application
<behelit>	grawity: thank you
<earnestly>	hannibal_smith: perf(1) is a really great tool btw, and callgrind + qcachegrind or gprof2dot -f callgrind
<hannibal_smith>	yes, i already use perf
<hannibal_smith>	less valgrind suite
<earnestly>	hannibal_smith: postgrsql can't handle data this big before just dying
<earnestly>	see acm article
<earnestly>	!ftp
<phrik>	size of data to be transferred: one kilobyte. amount of data transfered to talk about the data about to be transfered: one megabyte.
<earnestly>	this is what ends up happening :p
<bougyman>	every single time i forget to turn pulseaudio off after a google hangout then try to play a video i get this crap:  ************************************************
<bougyman>	           **** your system is too slow to play this!  ****
<bougyman>	           ************************************************
<bougyman>	possible reasons, problems, workarounds: - most common: broken/buggy _audio_ driver - try -ao sdl or use the oss emulation of alsa. - experiment with different values for -autosync, 30 is a good start.
<sudokode>	bougyman: in what?
<earnestly>	mplayer
<bougyman>	mplayer
<earnestly>	you can ignore it
<sudokode>	heh
<bougyman>	but the video lags and freezes and spurts
<bougyman>	i really can't ignore it.
<sudokode>	have you tried mpv?
<earnestly>	that's weird
<bougyman>	all it means (now) is c-c killall pulseaudio !mplayer<enter>
<earnestly>	bougyman: you know, `kill` can take names too
<bougyman>	sudokode: no, vlc does similar with pulse on
<earnestly>	bougyman: `kill pulseaudio`, has been able to do so for like 20 years
<grawity>	is that with -ao pulse or -ao alsa, i wonder
<bougyman>	and it's pretty obvious, pulseaudio is eating 100% of cpu.
<grawity>	never used hangouts aside from text
<bougyman>	grawity: it's with no -ao
<earnestly>	i don't think mplayer supports pulse
<bougyman>	defaults to using alsa which is using pulse which is using alsa
<bougyman>	i tried -ao pulse and it's the same.
<grawity>	earnestly: it does
<earnestly>	ah, i thought they were more interested in supporting the ancient stuff
<bougyman>	 oss oss/ioctl audio output alsa alsa-0.9.x-1.x audio output pulse pulseaudio audio output jack jack audio output sdl sdllib audio output mpegpes dvb audio output v4l2 v4l2 mpeg audio decoder output null null audio output pcm raw pcm/wave file writer audio output
<grawity>	bougyman: well yeah, but pulse via libpulse and pulse via libasound→libpulse might have different results
<bougyman>	it suppors all of those.
<bougyman>	grawity: i thought the same
<bougyman>	we were both wrong.
<earnestly>	you'll have to do more investigation and get more data to look at
<bougyman>	it seems to always been on low-quality videos.
<bougyman>	maybe the sound stream is corrupt.
<earnestly>	are these videos you have or ones we can try?
<bougyman>	it's probably not legal for me to share them.
<bougyman>	they are purchased and legal for me to have.
<earnestly>	heh
<bougyman>	so they have copyright crap attached to them.
<tazmain>	youtube video via vlc or smbtube ?
<earnestly>	anyway, i can't think of reasons why and i've never encountered problems like that before.  if you do find some info on it, that might be interesting to see
<bougyman>	no, this is purchased porn.
<bougyman>	mostly mkv and avi.
<earnestly>	bougyman: here's one idea to just eliminate it
<bougyman>	earnestly: i already found that solution.
<bougyman>	just stop pulse.
<earnestly>	bougyman: try loading the udev module with tsched=0
<bougyman>	i keep it stopped all the time unless i'm in a google hangout. for some reason chrome requires pulse for that now.
<earnestly>	bougyman: i'd be interested to know if it's the buffer management instead of using just irq interupts is causing it
<earnestly>	tsched=0 reverts back to alsa-like irq interupts
<bougyman>	if it were interrupts shouldn't it affect alsa as well?
<bougyman>	oh, pulse does something different.
<bougyman>	gotcha, will try.
<earnestly>	yes, it uses the coreaudio design
<bougyman>	i am just a little bit curious about it.
<earnestly>	(delay lock loop)
<bougyman>	right, i remember that.
<bougyman>	perfect audio nonsense.
<earnestly>	!give bougyman 0pointer glitch free
<bougyman>	yep
<earnestly>	!give bougyman g 0pointer glitch free
<phrik>	bougyman: whats cooking in pulseaudios glitch-free branch: <http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/pulse-glitch-free.html>
<bougyman>	i know it
<earnestly>	bougyman: see paul davis' comments on it, if he says it's clever and something they missed out on, i presume it's a good thing.
<earnestly>	(they = alsa kernel api)
<earnestly>	anyway, i'd be interested to know if disabling the scheduling helps
<earnestly>	just `pacmd load-module module-udev-detect tsched=0`
<earnestly>	although, idk.  you might have to to put that in default.pa and restart it
<bougyman>	earnestly: the problem with the whole glitch-free model, imo, isn't technically about the method.
<bougyman>	it's about the crappy sound card technology degradation that created a necessity for it.
<earnestly>	it would have existed regardless as it's simply a better design
<bougyman>	it should be bypassed for good soundcards.
<earnestly>	software mixing is the future, it is now
<bougyman>	you don't want system timers doing what the specific dac timers are puspose-built for in a professional sound card.
<bougyman>	just like you wouldn't be running a software raid on a good hardware raid card.
<earnestly>	you would
<earnestly>	same reason you'd be using software defined radio instead of real hardware
<tazmain>	lol i load snd_usb_audio and i can't logout wonderful
<earnestly>	it's better, faster, much less expensive
<earnestly>	and a heck of a lot more flexible
<bougyman>	you could say much the same of software raid.
<earnestly>	i am
<bougyman>	except it's not faster, nor is software audio vs a professional sound card.
<earnestly>	idk, raid controllers + boot time is not a happy memory
<earnestly>	bougyman: professional audio is also software, unless paul davis isn't an authority on this topic
<earnestly>	i'm just assuming he's right, which is a terrible thing to do
<bougyman>	it is. but professional audio software is realtime.
<bougyman>	pulseaudio isn't.
<earnestly>	bougyman: actually, it can be these days
<bougyman>	you'd be doing pro sound card on an rt kernel with jack over alsa.
<bougyman>	which is what the people who run professional rigs (in linux) generally do.
<earnestly>	not necessarily using an rt kernel anymore either
<earnestly>	bougyman: but yeah, although pa can go realtime, you'd still use jack because of the protocol and the tools around it
<earnestly>	and why not, jack is amazing
<tazmain>	earnestly, do you think jack might solve my issues with alsa and snd_usb_audio? would i have to remove all pulse stuff and alsa-tools ?
<bougyman>	no
<earnestly>	tazmain: no to both questions :p
<diegoviola>	i never bothered to learn jack, is it a sound server like pulse too?
<dacoit>	yeah
<earnestly>	diegoviola: yes, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jack_audio_connection_kit
<phrik>	title: jack audio connection kit - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (at en.wikipedia.org)
<diegoviola>	so you just install, run it and point your apps to it?
<tazmain>	-_- drat i need an alsa dev then.
<earnestly>	diegoviola: consider http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/when-pa-and-when-not.html
<phrik>	title: pulseaudio and jack (at 0pointer.de)
<diegoviola>	thanks
<tazmain>	is thjere a way to manually set the interface for a usb sound card ?
<charlesatum>	i actually liked that quit line.
<cydrobolt>	hello
<cydrobolt>	is anyone here experienced with pulseaudio/alsa?
<cydrobolt>	i plugged in an hdmi cord into my computer a while ago, so java's output device switched to hdmi but it won't switch back to analog output anymore
<cydrobolt>	it's stuck in pavucontrol
<clarjon1>	cydrobolt: is the hdmi device still connected?
<lyonsb>	maybe get paprefs and check the box about simultaneous output?
<cydrobolt>	clarjon1, nope
<cydrobolt>	the cord is disconnected
<cydrobolt>	all other apps have switched back to analog output
<clarjon1>	cydrobolt: perhaps try reconnecting it so the device exists, then switching it manually in pavucontrol?
<cydrobolt>	but a single app (java) has been stuck on the nonexistent control
<cydrobolt>	maybe that will help
<cydrobolt>	pavucontrol gives me the option to switch it to analog audio, but clicking the option does nothing
<cydrobolt>	it's essentially stuck
<heartsnatcher>	try: amixer cset numid=3 1
<heartsnatcher>	you should be able to set this kinda stuff with "amixer cset"
<cydrobolt>	nope, that didn't work
<cydrobolt>	it's not due to the volume
<cydrobolt>	it's due to the wrong output device being set
<tazmain>	i can't believe that actually worked !!
<cydrobolt>	going to try plugging it in
<heartsnatcher>	cset is i think setting the output device
<tazmain>	earnestly, i took a usb extender cable and plugged my headphones into my front usb 2.0 ports it works !
<cydrobolt>	hmm\
<cydrobolt>	clarjon1, nope, plugging it back into the tv doesn't let me switch the audio output
<earnestly>	tazmain: hooray
<clarjon1>	sounds like java messed up. can you not just restart the java process?
<cydrobolt>	clarjon1, i've restarted it tons of times
<tazmain>	earnestly, odd though seems usb 3.0 is still unstable then?
<cydrobolt>	when it restarts, it always is back on hdmi
<clarjon1>	and it keeps going tothat non-existant output?
<cydrobolt>	yes
<clarjon1>	huh, weird.
<cydrobolt>	it's the only app that does it and it always does it
<clarjon1>	try finding it's config files and see if it has it saved?
<cydrobolt>	it was fine before i plugged in the hdmi cord too
<cydrobolt>	where are the configs?
<cydrobolt>	i deleted ~/.config/pulse for pulseaudio
<clarjon1>	that would depend on the java app.
<cydrobolt>	hmm, would it be controlled by the app?
<cydrobolt>	i feel like it would be something on alsa or pulse's part
<clarjon1>	it could be being set directly by the app, it sounds like.
<cydrobolt>	possibly
<cydrobolt>	let me try that
<earnestly>	wat http://ponylang.org/
<phrik>	title: pony - high performance actor programming (at ponylang.org)
<earnestly>	tazmain: it may be the headphones
<earnestly>	tazmain: esp. if they're gaming ones
<arch-tk>	what the actual fuck are push notifications?
<earnestly>	arch-tk: you become the server and the server becomes the client
<arch-tk>	well yes, but through what magic?
<tazmain>	earnestly, seems to be a common thing i saw this hint on an ubuntu forum with logitec headphones. non gaming ones
<sudokode>	man, true detective might have been the best buddy cop pairing of all time
<honestly>	and that magically saves battery somehow
<earnestly>	also, this pony language seems like a joke at first, but then they have papers and shit
<holomorph>	let's write ponymix in pony
<honestly>	(probably because the people who make the push notification api and service are actually competent)
<clarjon1>	the documentation feels really friendly towards new programmers.
<sudokode>	earnestly: you can find "serious" academic papers on lots of things :p
<earnestly>	they used systemd f to mechanically prove the type system wat
<earnestly>	system*
<earnestly>	well, it looks like system f
<earnestly>	sudokode: but it's like, proper and stuff
<earnestly>	it looks very much like those old 60s-70s languages syntactically

<sudokode>	:d
<earnestly>	this actually doesn't look bad
<clarjon1>	cydrobolt: well, i'm rather confused as to what to try next, i'm afraid.
<cydrobolt>	:( me too
<cydrobolt>	audio on linux :<
<earnestly>	it's like a pascal version of rust but hoare actor model
<sudokode>	dr. craig bennett put a dead salmon from the market under a functional mri scanner to show that, after enough measurements, a few voxels would light up often enough to "significantly correlate" with the images he was "showing" to the dead salmon as a visual stimulus. this would then lead him to the "conclusion" that the salmon was "thinking" through the lit up brain regions and that these were associated
<sudokode>	with visual processing in dead salmons.
<sudokode>	haha
<tazmain>	ewe pascal
<earnestly>	tazmain: pascal is a very beautiful language
<tazmain>	earnestly, mmm okay well delphi which used it was terrible
<earnestly>	i don't actually know about delphi
<odd0002>	hi
<sudokode>	earnestly: basically object-oriented pascal
<earnestly>	sudokode: not oo in that way
<earnestly>	sudokode: it's actor model
<earnestly>	sudokode: although it's really just fancy names for types
<earnestly>	class in c++ is a type, struct is a type, blah
<sudokode>	mhm
<earnestly>	it's not quite documented yet, meh
<earnestly>	it's not self-hosting yet either
<cloudef>	oo has many very funny terms
<cloudef>	like message passing, which in every language means different thing
<earnestly>	i just pretend oo doesn't exist and look for the real things
<cloudef>	in c++ is just accesing member, on objective-c it's some very weird proxy thing
<earnestly>	like what kind of message passing, what kind of data hiding, what kind of ...
<earnestly>	anyway, this pony is implemented in c at least
<earnestly>	using gnu style ;p
<lyonsb>	object.method.subobject.submethod.inheritedobject.inheritedmethod(self.method(wtf??)) ?
<sudokode>	cloudef: well, obj-c was inspired by smalltalk, which was written by the guy that sorta came up with oop, iirc
<sudokode>	names i do not recall
<earnestly>	sudokode: alan kay
<sudokode>	earnestly would know
<cloudef>	sudokode: yeah
<sudokode>	yeah that name sounds familiar
<earnestly>	lyonsb: that could be any language
<cloudef>	sudokode: i guess you could say other languages get the oo "wrong" :p
<sudokode>	heh that's what i've heard
<earnestly>	sudokode: his idea of oo was focused more on message passing
<sudokode>	i believe earnestly posted an article once that kay wrote talking about why modern oo is wrong
<cloudef>	but then again whole oo is just big very vague concept. i don't think anybody can explain what it even means
<sudokode>	i've always just seen oo as a means of orthogonality
<sudokode>	like modules and functions and the rest
<cloudef>	it's concept that does not show up in computers anywhere
<wasamasa>	no cars in computers
<wasamasa>	"it's for modeling the real world!"
<hiptobecubic>	i think the problem is that oo basically came to mean java/c++ over the 90's and early 2000's
<wasamasa>	well, i haven't seen a factoryfactory in the real world, silly
<earnestly>	this pony is actor model with capabilities, hmm
<earnestly>	although it's way too new
<hiptobecubic>	so if those languages couldn't do it, or did it badly, it wasn't oo and if they did, then it was.
<earnestly>	almost no comments, no real documentation
<earnestly>	i should package it
<lyonsb>	well, most science, math, etc . . . are about modeling the real world in some way.
<cloudef>	lyonsb: oo is exception, that it becomes impossible to explain people as it does not have any ties to inner working of program
<hiptobecubic>	wasamasa, when you see "factory" in java-esque oo you should really just be thinking "partially applied function"
<lyonsb>	do you mean oo assumes objectivity where there might not actually be any?
<lyonsb>	objectivity / subjectivity axis, not . . ."objectivity" as conjugate of "object"
<earnestly>	lyonsb: this article spends most of its efforts trying to define what it means: http://www.smashcompany.com/technology/object-oriented-programming-is-an-expensive-disaster-which-must-end and is hence very long.
<phrik>	title: object oriented programming is an expensive disaster which must end | smash company (at www.smashcompany.com)
<lyonsb>	i've read that article.
<hiptobecubic>	there can always be some, the problem is when you choose to represent things with stupid objects or make stupid relationships between them that only make sense to other people that have studied your stupid book about how to work around java's horribly limited feature set.
<lyonsb>	it's one of the classics in earnestly's meme stream on this topic. :)
<earnestly>	lyonsb: so i assume you know what we mean when we speak of objects?  if not, consult the "elements of programming" which explains what they mean
<aleb>	i'm making a package with makepkg and i see "==> tidying install..." "  -> stripping unneeded symbols from binaries and libraries..."  how do i skip that?
<dacoit>	!give aleb wiki debug traces
<phrik>	aleb: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/debug_-_getting_traces
<earnestly>	aleb: you don't really skip it, but you can set the pkgbuild to include options=(!strip)
<hiptobecubic>	so if you really can't pass a function around, then yes, suddenly you need to come up with patterns like "strategy" and "command," which are difficult to remember and get right because they are not how anyone sane would do it if you didn't force them to figure out how to noun all their verbs.
<lyonsb>	in your pkgbuild, adjust it and add options=(!strip).
<aleb>	let me try, thanks
<earnestly>	hiptobecubic: that seems to be an accurate explaination of the situation
<lyonsb>	aleb, that'll build your binary with debugging symbols, etc.
<earnestly>	"the reflection api should be mirror-based and capabilities-secure." heh, i don't know what this means
<earnestly>	but i like "reflection should be mirror-based"
<lyonsb>	as opposed to . . .?
<earnestly>	don't ask me lol
<rkreis>	the ocean, i guess?
<rkreis>	with waves all over
<sudokode>	my reflection is always mirror-based
<hiptobecubic>	maybe as opposed to just philosophically reflective
<lyonsb>	maybe we should have cloud-based jargon reflection in our emergent properties of new waveform analysis.
<sudokode>	that's how i keep an eye on it
<lyonsb>	lets use lasers.
<rkreis>	lasers *as a service*
<sudokode>	laas
<wasamasa>	hiptobecubic: hmm
<wasamasa>	hiptobecubic: i still can't believe just how much code it takes to represent that one concept in java
<lyonsb>	our new public laser api protocol is perfect for emerging markets of bogus java classes.
<hiptobecubic>	wasamasa, well it's quintessentially verby in a language explicitly designed not to have any. i'm surprised anyone managed at all.
<odd0002>	reflections should be portal-based
<earnestly>	odd0002: now there's an idea
<sudokode>	i got this shiny new api from a reputable nigerian prince
<wasamasa>	!grab sudokode
<phrik>	wasamasa: tada!
<lyonsb>	kind of feel sorry for the half a dozen or so legitimate nigerian princes.
<sudokode>	yeah, poor rich guys
<odd0002>	reflections based on mystical time-space bending
<sudokode>	i feel the same way every time i take a shit
<sudokode>	s/take a shit/think about rich guys/
<holomorph>	i'd rather have a zamundan api
<dacoit>	!grab sudokode
<phrik>	dacoit: tada!
<lyonsb>	might be kind of fun to do some kind of data science project based on the jargon file.
<shadowkatstudios>	can i get an api to control nazguls? http://izaya.pc-logix.com/image/onering.jpg
<odd0002>	hmm, i came in here to ask a question, turns out a reboot fixed it
<sudokode>	shadowkatstudios: http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/a5ed94c8c3d50b8e5f859dc5601d4d6a489a64b5.gif
<sudokode>	one ring to rule them all ^
<sudokode>	(that's the only pun i could think of)
<shadowkatstudios>	sudokode: are there then smaller sub-rings?
<sudokode>	ofc
<odd0002>	i finally have 2 seperate hdd's
<sudokode>	it wouldn't be a network if it didn't have complicated caveats
<odd0002>	so i partitioned them to make a 50 gb raid 1 array
<shadowkatstudios>	excellent. well then, time to invade gondor.
<sudokode>	odd0002: welcome to 2001
<odd0002>	sudokode: because the rest of the 1 tb i'll use for other files
<aleb>	dacoit, earnestly, lyonsb, it works! i struggled with this for a week almost. filed a (real) bug with python.. btw, impressive number of fast responses, thanks again :)
<lyonsb>	welcome.  :)  you might also need debug to options as well, like options=(!strip debug)
<diegoviola>	my thinkpad t510 died and i'm looking for a new one, what are your thoughts on the t450?
<cn>	but that's a smaller number
<namarrgon>	it's bigger if you add the digits up
<diegoviola>	meh
<namarrgon>	bigger==better
<diegoviola>	i think t5xx has a wider screen than t4xx but i could be wrong
<halosghost>	lol
<diegoviola>	http://i.imgur.com/xdrsmjf.jpg
<diegoviola>	that's my t510
<lyonsb>	saaalvaaage!
<namarrgon>	what was broken?
<diegoviola>	namarrgon: everything
<diegoviola>	i got some pieces that were reusable from the trash
<namarrgon>	that looks like you rage-quit
<diegoviola>	namarrgon: i was angry, sure
<tom^>	diegoviola: from where did you drop it?
<tom^>	diegoviola: stairs? ;p
<diegoviola>	tom^: something like that
<sledgehammer>	he said it died... so it must have jumped :)
<tom^>	i got more context then you do.
<namarrgon>	replacment parts for thinkpads are easy to come by, i hope you looked into reparing/replacing first
<diegoviola>	namarrgon: i already removed the keyboard and bezel a year ago, and it cost me too much to fix it, import taxes are not cheap here
<sudokode>	yeah, if you don't have a supplier in your country, replacement parts aren't that cheap
<diegoviola>	namarrgon: so i just got all parts that were ok still and gave them away to friends
<sudokode>	and is it even worth it for older hardware
<tom^>	i would just get a rpi and hook that monitor up to it
<tom^>	=d
<ambsace>	the wiki page for mkinitcpio says that nfsv4 is not supported, but the wiki page for diskless systems dscribes some modifications to the net hook for nfsv4.  does anyone successfully run diskless with root filesystems on nfsv4?
<diegoviola>	paying like $200 just for taxes for a $40 keyboard and $40 bezel, screw that
<diegoviola>	at the end of the day you're paying like $400 for two pieces of plastic
<namarrgon>	"country with high import-taxes" means there is a black-market. just look between the kalashnikovs and used stinger-launchers.
<sudokode>	heh
<namarrgon>	they should have something, doesn't have to be new
<sudokode>	or find a friend outside of that country to shove the parts up a chicken's ass and give it a kick over the border
<sudokode>	disclaimer: i do not endorse chicken violence
<diegoviola>	lol
<jushur>	sudokode: drone managed delivery ftw
<tom^>	no idea about other countrys but gifts are tax free to sweden
<sudokode>	ah there ya go
<tom^>	so no need for the chicken :p
<sudokode>	amazon will do it
<sudokode>	wonder if amazon ships to the amazon...
<sudokode>	tom^: no one is sending you gifts though
<tom^>	which is a tragedy in itself.

<sudokode>	the best thing for any computer is to never boot it
<tom^>	jasabella: use uefi if you wanna learn how the future is gonna work.

<sudokode>	bios is gonna easier to set up because it's very standard

<thrice>	wut
<sudokode>	uefi can be a little more complicated with different vendors
<tom^>	efivars is cute too but meh

<emperiz>	i have my usual routine with bios.. fdisk etc. everything easy as usual
<holomorph>	earnestly: hmph, no mention of an emacs mode for it :p

<earnestly>	holomorph: a bit eeeh
<earnestly>	at the end
<zat>	neckutrek: you need to use pthreads (or similar) to take advantage of multi-cores.
<namarrgon>	zat: both work fine here. what output do you get staring it from a terminal?
<holomorph>	earnestly: the hashmap?
<earnestly>	holomorph: the signature of map
<neckutrek>	zat, my program is meant to measure computation time of sequential code, so by not using pthreads etc i'm always getting it all run on one core then?

<rasi>	atm*
<earnestly>	rasi: it sort of has to be otherwise you limit the search.  at least it can let you change modifiers, but not shift of course
<rasi>	earnestly: he will probably change the return codes to negatives, so it never interferes with "1"
<rasi>	but it works perfectly
<rasi>	and of course i like that the commit is named "rasi-patch"
<rasi>	haha
<zat>	namarrgon: i got the bug, thanks for the help, if you want to reproduce it:
<zat>	touch $home/.config/qtproject/designer.conf.lock
<zat>	then run designer-qt5 with strace if you want
<earnestly>	rasi: it's not a bad idea
<rasi>	i already made a branch using this. and result was 200 lines less code
<earnestly>	rasi: although i will admit a bit that at this point it's almost better to just do it "properly" :p
<earnestly>	as in, write a program itself, or rasi can become a toolkit
<earnestly>	like zenity
<earnestly>	it kind of is
<rasi>	earnestly: that was his argument too.
<earnestly>	rafi*
<rasi>	rofi*
<dexter>	i lost the game
<namarrgon>	zat: indeed
<earnestly>	rasi: or turn rofi into a library, a bit like bemenu, and then you can do whatever
<earnestly>	rasi: still, it's nice to have but it is skimming the edge i suppose :p
<demize>	rasi: hmm, there's no such thing as a negative return code if you're talking about executables.
<earnestly>	demize: you can return -1 -2, etc.
<earnestly>	teapot earnest %i master ~ return -2
<earnestly>	zsh: exit -2
<demize>	dmm
<earnestly>	the linux kernel does it a lot
<earnestly>	-1 on error
<demize>	if you do it from a binary it will wrap around to 255 though
<earnestly>	signed int main(lololo)
<demize>	they're signed, yes
<earnestly>	anyway, the kernel does this
<demize>	actually try it though
<demize>	what you get in your shell will be 255
<earnestly>	i know i've see that
<earnestly>	demize: but read any of the linux api functions or even stuff like open(2)
<earnestly>	"return the new file descriptor, or -1 if an error occurred"
<psi-jack>	hmm.. well, i'm failing to find any resolution. networkmanager, setup to auto-assign ipv6, isn't. ipv6 is not disabled, link-local works, other non-arch systems are getting ra and assigning just fine, just not this. :/
<earnestly>	and set errno
<demize>	i'm quite aware of that
<demize>	which is why i said "if you're talking about executables"
<rasi>	demize: actually its about nothing. its a bout a keypress that generates a return code
<demize>	for what?
<rasi>	its only for deciding what to do...
<earnestly>	demize: yeah, you can't return negative values as an executable
<rasi>	carnager@caprica ~ > menu=$(echo "press alt+number" | rofi -dmenu -p "> "); echo "you pressed alt+$(echo $?)"
<rasi>	you pressed alt+5
<rasi>	thats all it does
<holomorph>	i vaguely remember seeing a toggle selection patch for dmenu, seemed useful
<demize>	rasi: i.e. it's entirely about executables since you can't return a negative exit code.
<demize>	unless rofi is some magic non-executable.
<michaelp>	dolphin.... unable to save bookmarks in . reported error was: no such file or directory. this error message will only be shown once. the cause of the error needs to be fixed as quickly as possible, which is most likely a full hard drive.
<psi-jack>	though it is odd.. on centos 7, with nm configured to do ipv6 in the same manner, is running dhclient with ipv6 arguments. nm on arch is not.
<earnestly>	demize: or rather, you can't return negative values from main
<demize>	earnestly: sure.
<jasabella>	so with uefi i want my first partition to be a fat32 esp 512mb in size

<earnestly>	it doesn't have to be the first partition, the partition type must be ef00 though, which uefi firmware will find
<earnestly>	oh, there's a new .config/chromium-flags.conf
<earnestly>	you can just dump --all-your-arguments-there, which can get long for chromium
<earnestly>	instead of using chromium_user_flags
<tom^>	huh what arguments do you use for chromium?
<earnestly>	tom^: e.g.
<earnestly>	--password-store=gnome
<earnestly>	or stuff like --ppapi-flash-path=/usr/lib/pepperflash/libpepflashplayer.so --ppapi-flash-version=16.0.0.305
<psi-jack>	hmm, in fact, why isn't networkmanager running dhclient with nm-dhcp-helper at all?
<earnestly>	tom^: chromium has lots, mostly documented in the manual
<tom^>	hm ok
<d_garbage>	yeah, a rare arch hack :)
<tom^>	d_garbage: huh?
<d_garbage>	the config file for chromium
<d_garbage>	it's arch specific iirc

<d_garbage>	[saturday 18 apr 2015] [20:23:32] <foutrelis>   tomty89: did you figure out why chromium-flags.conf wasn't working for you? in the mean time, i updated the wiki page: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/chromium_tweaks#making_flags_persistent
<phrik>	title: chromium tweaks - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<d_garbage>	see? lol, not mad quite yet
<earnestly>	d_garbage: yeah, but it doesn't seem to have been an arch only thing
<earnestly>	or hm
<earnestly>	hmmm
<d_garbage>	man that's annoying, a separate page 'chromium tweaks' and it's not listed in the "see also" section.
<d_garbage>	ah right, it's split out from 'tips and tricks'. i'm not a fan of splitting things up like that
<charlesatum>	it's on related articles
<d_garbage>	related articles?
<earnestly>	d_garbage: no idea, can't find where arch does anything specific wrt this, but it says it does, idk
<thrice>	look at the github launcher
<d_garbage>	charlesatum, or i see, at the top right
<agregory>	earnestly: did you look at the pkgbuild sources?
<earnestly>	launcher?
<earnestly>	agregory: i ... probably skimmed those
<thrice>	https://github.com/foutrelis/chromium-launcher/blob/master/chromium-launcher.in
<phrik>	title: chromium-launcher/chromium-launcher.in at master · foutrelis/chromium-launcher · github (at github.com)
<d_garbage>	well make searching a pain and i can't see the point
<earnestly>	oh snap
<earnestly>	that's lame
<earnestly>	i'm not really surprised given the tu, but there you go.  now to check if any of the other stuff i use isn't upstream
<earnestly>	thrice, agregory: thanks for the hint
<d_garbage>	bah!
<d_garbage>	}:]
<thrice>	wasn't me, agregory linked it, i just re-pasted :>
<d_garbage>	where's *my* gold star then, eh? *fume*
<earnestly>	oh, i had the pkgbuild open, i just wasn't paying attention
<sudokode>	i also want recognition
<d_garbage>	!sudokode
<phrik>	sudokode is a mega furry!!
<lyonsb>	participation medal!
<d_garbage>	^
<sudokode>	thx
<sudokode>	!rq sudokode
<phrik>	<sudokode> it's like someone took a torrent client and used it to disembowel a giraffe
<d_garbage>	lol
<earnestly>	lyonsb: in some places, actually participating contributes to the final grade
<d_garbage>	nice one
<charlesatum>	so, what is this chromium-launcher for?
<thrice>	charlesatum: read it?
<earnestly>	charlesatum: it basically sets up the --ppapi paths for people who use chrome pepper flash libraries without them having to do it
<lyonsb>	earnestly, i think there's also "participation bachelors degrees" too
<earnestly>	it also adds a new configuration file that loads extra configurations
<charlesatum>	oh, that's useful
<d_garbage>	[03/05/2015 23:09:42] <d_garbage> yeah, a rare arch hack :)
<earnestly>	charlesatum: it's also not part of chromium
<earnestly>	charlesatum: if you wanted useful, you'd use ubuntu
<lyonsb>	earnestly, in a class full of logical introverts, incentivizing meaningful contribution might be a wise manuever.
<earnestly>	lyonsb: it's quite stupid
<earnestly>	lyonsb: it would fail people like dirac
<lyonsb>	earnestly, or in a class full of people that are told they don't have voice, teaching them to use their voice to contribute might also be a wise manuever.
<lyonsb>	(this also goes to the whole "women in tech" thing, believe it or not)
<earnestly>	wat.
<d_garbage>	nah, jsut means the most pushy get the rewards, oh wait, that just life already
<lyonsb>	generally, yeah, "extrovert privlege" or something. . . ?
<earnestly>	you read too much nonsense, i swear
<lyonsb>	haha, do you mean me?
<earnestly>	yeah :p
<charlesatum>	i guess there is a bug report so chromium searches for the flash plugin on the correct place, right?
<d_garbage>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjlhrhlvwzs
<phrik>	title: grandmaster flash - the message - youtube (at www.youtube.com)
<earnestly>	charlesatum: no idea
<lyonsb>	well, you know . . . to quote the big lebowsky "that's just like, your opinion man . . ."
<d_garbage>	school's in kids ;)
<thrice>	encouraging some participation from shy people isn't a bad thing
<d_garbage>	"it's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how i keep from going under"
<earnestly>	thrice: making their success depend on it?
<d_garbage>	you don't have to be from the ghetto to feel that sentiment
<lyonsb>	you're suggesting that their success would not depend on it sometime int he future . . .
<earnestly>	seems kind of cruel and stupid, from a historical perspective
<d_garbage>	(but it helps of course)
<earnestly>	lyonsb: it doesn't
<thrice>	you had a college class that was that extreme, where you couldn't pass without it?
<earnestly>	i assume you've heard of dirac, if not, look him up.  or perhaps alonzo church
<earnestly>	or perhaps alan turing
<lyonsb>	well, there's a lot of studies that suggest it does -- but the potential for misconduct using completely honest statistics . . .  -- yes, and considering what happened to alan turing for speaking up . .
<earnestly>	lyonsb: he generally didn't speak, he was shy, thoughtful
<earnestly>	so are most of the most important contributors to science throughout history.  dirac is the best example, einstein even came up with a metric of "diracs per minute" to indicate how someone spoke (slowly)
<earnestly>	dirac would be very careful in saying the correct thing or he'd not speak at all.  his list of contributions is staggering
<psi-jack>	huh... interesting.. it was proxmox ve's firewall causing ipv6 ra's not to get to the guest vm.
<lyonsb>	sure.  outliers are valuable, sure.  that's not the general trend regarding professional "success" nowadays, whatever that means.
<earnestly>	lyonsb: it shouldn't hinge on it
<earnestly>	it shouldn't be graded
<earnestly>	that's not how you "encourage" anything
<lyonsb>	we should offer people money?
<esdf>	i'll take it!
<earnestly>	that would produce even worse results
<lyonsb>	academic excellence doesn't correlate well with financial success -- (at least, not that i know of)
<earnestly>	and that's a study, by mit and the federal reserve bank of america
<earnestly>	the more money you offer, for anything that requires any intelligence, the worse the result
<lyonsb>	i hope you understand, that actually i agree with you at least 80%
<earnestly>	in terms of speed
<lyonsb>	sure, cognitive tasks, etc.
<earnestly>	across all nations and wealth
<earnestly>	lyonsb: rudamentary cognitive skill
<lyonsb>	mmmhmm, i know exactly what you mean, the incentives are mastery and autonomy and . . . other stuff like htat.
<earnestly>	anything above scewing lids on toothpaste tubes
<lyonsb>	mmmhmm, when it's widgets/minute it works, since widgets/minute doesn't require much problem solving.
<lyonsb>	much anything other than "twist knob onto widget"
<earnestly>	i think they used the candle problem
<lyonsb>	yes.
<lyonsb>	although that was also used to test something else as well
<earnestly>	heh, this study was done before, with the same results apparently
<earnestly>	glucksberg
<lyonsb>	a particular form of confirmation bias -- by altering the test conditions to either have the box full of tacks or the tacks outside the box.
<lyonsb>	i remember that study off the top of my head, heh.
<earnestly>	that's what glucksberg did
<lyonsb>	but yeah, offering the students some money for completing it "before someone else"
<lyonsb>	there's also some studies about group effort, social loafing, many other tasks, etc.
<lyonsb>	and yes, money does not incentivize performance.
<thrice>	not even to a degree?
<lyonsb>	but participation grades tend to be more of a "did you speak up?" rather than a subjective evaluation of the quality of the content.
<thrice>	there is a sweet spot with paying employees, at a point where they forget about the compensation, because it isn't important
<earnestly>	thrice: well, it makes the participants in the studies worse
<earnestly>	thrice: from mit to rural indea
<lyonsb>	yes, but if you don't pay them enough, it becomes a stressor?
<earnestly>	india*
<thrice>	sure
<earnestly>	lyonsb: you have to pay just enough to take "money off the table"
<cyphix>	hi. i'm trying to install archlinux in a virtual machine, but i'm stuck on the choice between the two types of partition tables, mbr or gpt. i'm not familiar with this at all, so i don't know how to check for the appropriate selection for me. could someone enlighten me about this choice?
<earnestly>	thrice: which is what you said, yes ^
<lyonsb>	(a stressor with some incredibly robust knock-on effects, esp over generations)
<lyonsb>	(and by robust i mean "riots and social unrest if it's not resolved in a generation or two")
<earnestly>	cyphix: honestly the best info you can get is wikipedia on gpt
<earnestly>	cyphix: as it will explain mbr in context and why you should use gpt, but also in relation to uefi or bios
<cyphix>	earnestly: as far as i understood, gpt seems better. so i chose to follow this path. but i have a problem with gummiboot, and i was wondering if it was related to this.
<lyonsb>	cyphix, you could prob. use mbr if you're just making a vm for your own experimentation.  if it's production . . . dunno.
<earnestly>	you want gpt pretty much regardless
<earnestly>	if you can use it
<lyonsb>	(yeah, if you want to experiment with zfs, gpt is mandatory)
<lyonsb>	(for example)
<cyphix>	ok. so i did the good choice. but i don't understand what is meant by "if a new uefi system partition has been created on a uefi/gpt system, it must be formatted with a fat32 or vfat32 file system."
<lyonsb>	(but if your just installing arch for the practice of installing arch, on a desktop or somesuch, choose whichever one is least familiar to you :)
<cyphix>	what should i format in fat32? the boot partition?
<cyphix>	or every partition?
<earnestly>	cyphix: nope, if you're willing read this article:
<earnestly>	!give cyphix uefi2
<phrik>	cyphix: https://www.happyassassin.net/2014/01/25/uefi-boot-how-does-that-actually-work-then/
<lyonsb>	uhh, you can, i'm fairly sure you have to demarcate a partition as efi00 and it's that one that has to have the vfat formatting.
<clarjon1>	how many vms do uefi tho?
<earnestly>	cyphix: it will explain all of this.  i'll leave you with, "you should probably make /boot your esp just to avoid the need to copy kernels over if you're using gummiboot"
<earnestly>	lyonsb: ef00*
<earnestly>	clarjon1: all of them
<clarjon1>	neat.
<lyonsb>	^^
<earnestly>	you sometimes just have to enable them in different ways
<earnestly>	but they can all do it, at least
<earnestly>	if you did vms, you'd probably be better off with coreboot though
<teraflop>	clarjon1: as in qemu-system-x86.64 ... -pflash bios.bin or whatever
<cyphix>	so it seems i did things correctly according to the wiki. but i still have this error when installing gummiboot : "not booted with efi, skipping efi variable setup"
<clarjon1>	i was not aware that vms did uefi now. that's really neat.
<earnestly>	well, you have to boot in uefi mode
<earnestly>	see how to do that for your vm
<grogoreo>	hi
<cyphix>	earnestly: i use virtualbox. is it the option "activate efi" ?
<lyonsb>	roll the knobs, flip the switches, check the boxes, move the sliders.  see what happens . . .
<lyonsb>	if you are using gnome, you can even fondle the notification area.
<earnestly>	cyphix: try and see
<grogoreo>	i'm adding vi settings to inputrc for readline input and going through the wiki (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/readline#history) there are keymaps for "\e[a": and "\e[b": i just wanted to know what is being bound here? i get it's an escape code but for what? also has anyone managed to get show-mode-in-prompt working?
<phrik>	title: readline - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<cyphix>	earnestly: i will. it's just that i can't modify it afterwards. i'll have to strat from zero. anyway, hope it will work now.
<derpadong>	if i have a list of packages installed from another disk, is there a way to reinstall these packages?
<earnestly>	grogoreo: not for bash; anyway they're escapes defined by terminfo, the terminal you're using
<earnestly>	grogoreo: man terminfo for the gory details
<earnestly>	cyphix: if you installed in non-efi mode, you can just install gummiboot to efi/bootx64.efi (or bootia32.efi on 32bit x86) and it should fallback on that.  anyway, that long article talks about this too, so read that
<grogoreo>	earnestly: ta, i'll have a look.
<supergeek800>	i've a slight hunch that my problems with 4.0 being unbootable may be linked to using the r300 driver, but not entirely sure about that.
<supergeek800>	tried contacting the main linux chat to see if i can't get any info to verify that.
<supergeek800>	just because the system is bootable again because of using 3.14lts for the kernel, don't mean i won't pry into what is keeping me off 4.0.
<earnestly>	supergeek800: the main linux chat?  you mean the ##linux channel?
<supergeek800>	ywp.
<earnestly>	supergeek800: it's not an official channel, the ## indicates this
<ahop>	have anyone trid to create a new /etc/udev/rules.d/mynewrule.rules ?
<earnestly>	you'll actually usually be better off staying away from it, in my experience
<ahop>	sucessfully?
<ahop>	i'm stuck with this
<callipygous>	hi
<supergeek800>	earnestly: worst case, i'm stuck on lts until i can get a half-decent system. best-case, whatever is up with 4.0 and r300 will be resolved eventually and i can run the latest kernel again.
<callipygous>	i'm currently running e19, but i want to install e17, is it possible to somehow do this?
<earnestly>	yes
<scimmia>	callipygous, sure. best way would be to create a new pkgbuild that builds from the enlightenment-0.17 branch of enlightenment's git repo
<scimmia>	i know there was someone working on that
<callipygous>	working on it? hmm
<ahop>	earnestly: any idea?
<callipygous>	i don't know how to make pkgbuilds though
<scimmia>	callipygous, that was a week ago, maybe? haven't heard about it since
<iamlayinganegg>	hello
<scimmia>	and i don't keep my logs, so i can't say who it was
<callipygous>	aur has some enlightenment17 packages, but not enlightenment17 itself :(
<callipygous>	oh well
<iamlayinganegg>	can someone help me with steam not working? https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/34raoq/you_are_missing_the_following_32bit_libraries_and/cqxca1m
<scimmia>	callipygous, what packages? afaik, all of the "enlightenment17" packages are gone from the aur
<iamlayinganegg>	i think i found the problem, i just dont know how to fix the too many levels of symbolic links.
<scimmia>	if there's some still there, i need to know
<callipygous>	e17-icons, e17-themes, e17-backgrounds....
<callipygous>	e17-themes-ru
<scimmia>	ah, yeah, those poss
<scimmia>	mostly they didn't even work with the e17 releases
<scimmia>	was going to get them removed, but never got around to it
<namarrgon>	!give ahop wiki udev
<phrik>	ahop: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/udev
<namarrgon>	ahop: ^ has a couple of links that you should read
<iamlayinganegg>	can anyone help with me too many symlinks problem?
<iamlayinganegg>	on steam
<parkerr>	iamlayinganegg: are you trying to make a symlink of a symlink?
<iamlayinganegg>	parkerr: https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/34raoq/you_are_missing_the_following_32bit_libraries_and/cqxd9er?context=10000
<phrik>	title: iamlayinganegg comments on you are missing the following 32-bit libraries, and steam may not run: libc.so.6 (at www.reddit.com)
<iamlayinganegg>	i am the op
<parkerr>	i'd say a safe way would be to move your game folder out of the way and just nuke everything and rerun steam
<parkerr>	it shouldnt have any libc errors at least on arch
<iamlayinganegg>	i did nuke
<iamlayinganegg>	i nuked .steam
<iamlayinganegg>	and /.local/share/steam
<iamlayinganegg>	but notice how it has //
<scimmia>	iamlayinganegg, so what symlinks do you have in that path?
<iamlayinganegg>	idk if it none
<scimmia>	the double slash is meaningless
<parkerr>	not sure then
<iamlayinganegg>	i dont have any symlinks that i created in there
<supergeek800>	also, there's an issue with the latest lts kernel resulting in usb wireless chips using the r8191 driver that results in it being disabled.
<iamlayinganegg>	it's all steam
<jasabella>	i'm guessing i should disable intel rapid start technology
<scimmia>	iamlayinganegg, i didn't ask what you created, i asked what links were there
<supergeek800>	a little surprising considering it being lts, but whatever.
<earnestly>	supergeek800: lts doesn't mean much
<iamlayinganegg>	uhhh
<earnestly>	it doesn't get less updates
<iamlayinganegg>	how would i check that scimmia
<supergeek800>	earnestly: it means a bootable system in my case, unless whatever's preventing 4.0 from booting on my system gets resolved at some point, lol.
<earnestly>	sure, but that's almost purely coincidental

<lyonsb>	if this chat was a first person shooter, all the kicking would leave the walls looking like van gogh working in blood and body parts.
<lyonsb>	in other news, maybe we should put !pastebin into the topic?
<namarrgon>	nobody reads the topic
<scimmia>	we have a topic?
<lyonsb>	can phrik be told to send a /msg to anyone on joining with something like "paste more than two lines, be kicked" . . .?
<lyonsb>	maybe this isn't the problem.
<lyonsb>	is this the problem?  like, basic ettiquitte?
<earnestly>	three lines
<lyonsb>	i see your three lines and raise you one, to four lines!  ? --
<earnestly>	lyonsb: it's basic etiquette, all channels are like this
<lyonsb>	yes.
<lyonsb>	but it isn't written anywhere except on bang cmds.
<earnestly>	it's written in the irc rules
<earnestly>	!rules
<phrik>	go here >> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/irc_channel << for the channel rules/guidelines, and other useful information.
<lyonsb>	maybe i don't understand the problem?  it seems like no one reads/knows the rules soooo . . .
<holomorph>	so they can gtfo
<holomorph>	and maybe even get a clue
<sudokode>	we need an auto-notice to people
<earnestly>	lyonsb: 99% of people do
<baconicsynergy>	hey guys, i've been rtfming for the past few days on an issue and was hoping you could help me out
<holomorph>	!ask
<earnestly>	i don't see a problem, i just think people accidently paste into the channel more than deliberate
<phrik>	don't ask to ask, if anyone is here or alive, or uses something. just ask, and we'll get moving along. thanks.
<sudokode>	please register to chat. do not paste more than 3 lines at once. please read the rules: /msg phrik rules
<sudokode>	have phrik notice that to anyone on joining
<sudokode>	problem solved
<lyonsb>	maybe it isn't a problem.
<sudokode>	it happens enough
<lyonsb>	stupid until proven otherwise?
<sudokode>	just like the registering your nick thing
<earnestly>	lyonsb: on irc, it's the reverse (at least to me)
<earnestly>	given by the fact they're using irc at all :p
<lyonsb>	it does seem like it could be automated and reduce the quantity of "hat get, apply boot, unhat"
<mpdavis73>	at aol support, we used to say gtfomp
<lyonsb>	there is that.
<mpdavis73>	get the f off my phone
<sudokode>	lyonsb: well, no because people that aren't used to irc usually have a gui client like hexchat or konversation
<earnestly>	lyonsb: it's a small problem and almost never comes up.  i don't see why any measures need to be taken
<lyonsb>	i also use hexchat actually
<baconicsynergy>	i've been trying to set up a dark transparent gtk theme, but i can't seem to enable transparency with compton...
<sudokode>	those clients have a look to them like you can just throw a bunch of text in and who cares
<lyonsb>	it would prob. suit me to switch to irssi or weechat for the vimification since i seem to be slowly crawling towards more keyboard-only usage . . .
<sudokode>	whereas with a tui client, you tend to respect line space more
<sudokode>	neither are vi-like
<earnestly>	sadly :p
<lyonsb>	ohhhhh.
<sudokode>	they're like most gui clients. /cmd-based with keyboard shortcuts
<holomorph>	so gui ⇒ flood, interesting.
<sudokode>	usually ctrl-something or alt-something
<sudokode>	even have mouse support due to ncurses
<earnestly>	sudokode: all of those clients will warn on any attempts, that's enough prevention
<lyonsb>	earnestly, fair enough, i guess i"ve got "occured several times while i was watching <random channel that might not be this one> today"
<lyonsb>	bias.
<earnestly>	lyonsb: small channels don't mind it so much
<sudokode>	well it must be a stupidity thing then
<earnestly>	sudokode: yes, and no amount of prevention will help there
<sudokode>	we still need to +r this channel and have an auto-notice for it
<sudokode>	and for /msg phrik rules
<sudokode>	that's trivial to implement and bothers no one
<earnestly>	even if you notice, they won't see it, won't read it, won't follow it, because they are stupid in the first place :p
<mpdavis73>	who is going to self?
<sudokode>	at least we can say they were warned already
<earnestly>	sudokode: their clients already do
<sudokode>	if they argue, /kick watch the notice when you rejoin
<callipygous>	is there anywhere i can get old packages from?
<sudokode>	earnestly: not about the pasting thing
<mpdavis73>	git?
<sudokode>	we've already moved passed that
<cmiles74>	imho, people will do it wrong at least once. then someone points out how icky pasting into irc looks and they use a pastebin from then on.
<sudokode>	past
<baconicsynergy>	callipygous: i've been wondering the same thing myself
<sudokode>	passed
<sudokode>	no past
<earnestly>	passed is fine too
<lyonsb>	sudokode, i think we've gotten to the point where it's either go / no-go on implementation.
<mpdavis73>	i tried ubuntu mate on my laptop - moving back to arch now
<scimmia>	callipygous, the arm, but it only goes back so far, and you have to be very careful what libs those old packages are linked to
<mpdavis73>	drunk arch install - what can go wrong?
<callipygous>	what is the arm?
<earnestly>	sudokode: passed the point in the past
<scimmia>	!give callipygous wiki arm
<baconicsynergy>	mpdavis73: drunken arch installations can only lead to good things happening
<phrik>	callipygous: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/samsung_chromebook_(arm)
<scimmia>	hmm, that's not right
<callipygous>	chromebook? :s
<lyonsb>	yeah that's the other part, it seems like a "it only happens once" kind of thing.
<baconicsynergy>	lol
<namarrgon>	!arm
<sudokode>	earnestly: lol you're just asking for revenge there
<phrik>	arch rollback machine. a 3rd party repository for old packages. see https://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-general/2013-september/034094.html
<lyonsb>	and a kick isn't a ban.
<callipygous>	thanks
<baconicsynergy>	awesome, i learned something new today
<sudokode>	!give baconicsynergy til
<phrik>	baconicsynergy: http://www.takenseriouslyamusing.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/til.jpg
<baconicsynergy>	<3
<baconicsynergy>	but serious question here, does anyone have experience with transparent gtk theming?
<mpdavis73>	let's see if win8 can survive a partition move
<sudokode>	mpdavis73: no
<lyonsb>	i believe they call that an upgrade :)
<scimmia>	it can, i've done it
<sudokode>	now everything that expects c:\ will be looking for d:\ instead
<sudokode>	:(
<mpdavis73>	ndb, was just for the android tools anyway - i think i have a java odin around somewhere
<sudokode>	the poor letters
<callipygous>	scimmia, know if the current efl and elementary will work with a previous version of e?  i.e. e17
<lyonsb>	windows 8 failing to survive a partition move: that's a feature!
<callipygous>	no, wait, it needs a bunch of other packages...
<mpdavis73>	just moved the partition with gparted
<scimmia>	callipygous, yes, it will. jef91 is doing it with bodhi
<sudokode>	that's anti-copy protection
<sudokode>	wouldn't want someone stealing your data
<jasabella>	hmmm
<mpdavis73>	like m$?
<jasabella>	uefi archinux is different from bios
<sudokode>	jasabella: as in...
<supergeek800>	how bad is it to consider going to ubuntu lts from arch because you've a feeling that it'll run better on your hardware than arch, because you've 8-yr-old hardware that evidently won't work with 4.0?
<jasabella>	no pretty graphics
<sudokode>	woo i'm caught up on veep
<sudokode>	weird
<namarrgon>	supergeek800: you have to live with that choice, not us
<mpdavis73>	supergeek800: 4.0 was only a normal update, according to linus
<phreakachu>	i'm surprised that 4.0 would not work with 8 year old hardware
<phreakachu>	but i guess it's not impossible it could be broken
<supergeek800>	phreakachu: r300 i assume is the problem in my case.
<sudokode>	what's r300?
<supergeek800>	amd.
<scimmia>	supergeek800, if that's the case, it's a regression that needs to be reported upstream
<namarrgon>	if it is a regression then report it and it'll get fixed
<lyonsb>	radeon graphics card pre 6870
<sudokode>	the radeon driver doesn't support it?
<lyonsb>	(6870 = r600 driver)
<sudokode>	i find it hard to believe the radeon driver would drop support for 8 year old hardware
<scimmia>	they didn't. atleast not on purpose
<sudokode>	i sense skullduggery
<jasabella>	i'm a little confused as to whichoption heh
<earnestly>	xorg just added xrandr support for riva128 ...
<sudokode>	haha
<sudokode>	ofc they did
<deusstultus>	world domination, inc. eh?
<sudokode>	there's still a driver for rage128 iirc
<lyonsb>	supergeek800, you'll need a lot more evidence than "because i've got a feeling" -- there are so many other hidden factors that may be giving you that feeling that have nothing to do with performance or "better" --
<lyonsb>	and all of those are good.
<lyonsb>	i mean, if your feeling is that ubuntu lts is for you, then go for it -- your feelings are totally valid etc.
<supergeek800>	lyonsb: this is based on hardware alone.
<sudokode>	plus linux-lts is still on 3.14
<scimmia>	i've got a machine running r300 that should probably be updated
<scimmia>	maybe i'll give it a go
<sudokode>	and you can always use whatever kernel you like
<deusstultus>	i've hurr durr'ed my fair share in this life and always related well to sheep, so stepping back to 3.14 is out of the question, but to each his own
<sudokode>	just grab an old tarball for it
<sudokode>	"stepping back"
<sudokode>	generally you start with -lts if you've gotten older hardware
<sudokode>	got*
<scimmia>	generally lts isn't going to be much different than mainline if you've got old hardware
<scimmia>	older drivers don't get much attention
<sudokode>	probably not
<sudokode>	especially on arch
<sudokode>	the -lts bumps are a bit more frequent
<welenad>	excuse me: how can i tell startx which window manager to load?
<namarrgon>	!give welenad wiki xinitrc
<phrik>	welenad: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xinitrc
<callipygous>	seems e17 wants eio, efreet,edje, eeze
<scimmia>	callipygous, all of those are part of efl now
<callipygous>	ah okay, so i can force it ?
<scimmia>	don't know, never tried to tell pacman to ignore deps like that
<callipygous>	okay, i'll give it a try
<callipygous>	bbl
<case_of>	hi
<case_of>	:: bluez-qt et libbluedevil-frameworks sont en conflit. supprimer libbluedevil-frameworks ? [o/n]
<case_of>	should i delete that package ?
<d_garbage>	lang=c in front of a command will give english output
<saimeidae>	a package is showing up on the package listing, but isn't on any of the 4 mirrors i have (that i acquired today via armrr). nothing greenlet (python- or python2-) are downloading via pacman (saying it doesn't exist on the source).
<d_garbage>	handy for debugging
<jasabella>	hmmm
<saimeidae>	any clue what can be done to fix it?
<d_garbage>	pacman -syu
<case_of>	conflicts between bluez-qt and libluedeveil-frameworks
<d_garbage>	!partial
<phrik>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman#partial_upgrades_are_unsupported
<diegoviola>	how heavy is 4 lbs?
<jasabella>	so the esp be 512mib mounted at /boot?
<jasabella>	1.8kg
<case_of>	pacman asks me if i want to delete libbluedevil-frameworks
<d_garbage>	couple of bags of sugar?
<eleventh>	degoviola just under 2kg
<diegoviola>	i wonder how heavy that is
<saimeidae>	thanks d_garbage, i guess everything wasn't synced when i did that last.
<d_garbage>	yeah use the bag of sugar standard: 1kg -2.2 lbs :p
<diegoviola>	thinking about buying a new laptop
<diegoviola>	but i need it to be light
<eleventh>	4lbs is not bad. not ultralight but fine for a backpack
<d_garbage>	saimeidae, that happens when you sync without updating which can be a bad idea
<d_garbage>	!sos
<phrik>	_never_ -sy when installing! http://gist.io/5660494
<jasabella>	quick way to convert lbs -> kg: halve and take 10% off, gets you 2 significant figures :)
<saimeidae>	mmh, pretty sure i never did that but hey, nothing exploded!
<d_garbage>	bags of sugar, tellin' ya
<d_garbage>	saimeidae, or when you install without syncing :)
<d_garbage>	saimeidae, simplest way use: pacman -syu <package>
<saimeidae>	ooh, i usually do sync without updating or anything, yeah.
<saimeidae>	bad habit i guess.
<d_garbage>	saimeidae, use 'checkupdates' instead
<d_garbage>	one of the scripts that come with pacman
<d_garbage>	downloads a copy of the db's to /tmp and checks against that
<saimeidae>	would someone mind mentioning me in about 20 seconds as a test? science has a cost ya'know :d
<tolstoi>	saimeidae,
<saimeidae>	thanks, worked perfectly.
<tolstoi>	np
<diegoviola>	is 4lbs light enough to carry a laptop this way? http://pressandupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/lenovo-think-pad.jpg
<diegoviola>	or that would be ~2lbs?
<case_of>	depends what you want to do with
<diegoviola>	case_of: i'm looking for a light laptop
<diegoviola>	light enough to travel comfortably with it
<case_of>	to move it a lot all day ?
<diegoviola>	case_of: and do work with it
<case_of>	ultra mobility ?
<case_of>	look for the lightest possible
<jasabella>	so i really only need 2 partitions with uefi, a esp and everything else/fill rest of hdd?
<diegoviola>	t450s seems to be lighter than t450
<diegoviola>	but more expensive too
<diegoviola>	x1 carbon is more expensive than both of those
<scimmia>	jasabella, pretty much
<diegoviola>	and lighter too
<scimmia>	jasabella, unless you want a swap partition
<case_of>	jasabella: i think you should seperate minimally your /home folder in another partition
<jasabella>	i do that with my thinkpad all the time (well from the side!)... but it's nowhere near as thinas that one, it's a x230 :d
<jasabella>	hmm
<case_of>	diegoviola: depends about your budget too
<case_of>	diegoviola: how much do you want to spend on it ?
<jasabella>	case_of: in case i bork up yea
<jasabella>	sizes is hard to estimate :/
<case_of>	jasabella: are you going to install a lot of programs ?
<jasabella>	i dont know
<braindamage>	diegoviola: unfortunately, your question has no definite answer
<braindamage>	( re: the weight )
<zzat>	hi guys, i'm trying to run postgres on my arch machine but everytime i try to start the service it fails with this error http://pastebin.com/ef1ginj2 . i tried finding postgres.conf and pg_hba.conf but couldn't find them . any pointers?
<phrik>	title: execstartpre=/usr/bin/postgresql-check-db-dir ${pgroot}/data (code=exited, statu - pastebin.com (at pastebin.com)
<braindamage>	because how the weight is distributed will change the torque, think of the laptop as a lever
<braindamage>	that will push your thumb up
<jasabella>	if i do mess up i suppose i can boot off usb and mount the internal hdd and just copy out what i need
<case_of>	jasabella: while you do not erase your partitions :d
<scimmia>	jasabella, you can always go for a more complex partition/subvol layout: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1525627#p1525627
<phrik>	title: systemd can't start load kernel modules after upgrade to linux 4.0 / kernel & hardware / arch linux forums (at bbs.archlinux.org)
<case_of>	:o
<case_of>	i did not had this problem
<jasabella>	erasing your partitions is very hard to accidentally do unless you're messing around with fdisk/cfdisk/parted or something
<jasabella>	right?
<case_of>	yes
<case_of>	or dd too :d
<braindamage>	dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/sd*
<braindamage>	aaaand it's gone
<mmarker>	i was just going to say dd. late night working on embedded system sd cards... dd is not forgiving
<braindamage>	you'll likely need superuser
<jasabella>	hmmmm
<mmarker>	"wait, did i want sdb or sdcraaaappppp"
<jasabella>	i'm fairly paranoid about dd
<deusstultus>	tried to resize my var partition last week to find that it started on an illegal sector and i couldn't legitimately extend it.  pacman gets ornery when it loses it's db
<deusstultus>	s/'s/s/
<spartan-s63>	does grub allow you to boot with a kernel that isn't in the /boot partition? if not, is it just refind and gummiboot that allow for that?
<phreakachu>	usually fdisk will pick by default properly aligned start/end locations
<mmarker>	spartan: as long as its on a filesystem grub can read, tje kernel can be anywhere
<diegoviola>	case_of: not much
<spartan-s63>	mmarker: okay, thanks. do you know offhand if it can read an ext4 file system?
<diegoviola>	case_of: i'm cheap, but i'm willing to pay a reasonable amount too
<mmarker>	grub2 can.
<spartan-s63>	mmarker: yep, i just found that from a quick search. okay, sounds good. i'm trying to install arch in a dual boot configuration with windows 8.1 and the windows esp is on a raid 0 array. i was hoping to reuse that esp rather than create another one. i just am not sure which bootloader to go with. any suggestions?
<mmarker>	beyond me! i usually put linux on first, and then mercilessly beat windows into submission. so i may not be a great reference.
<deusstultus>	i'm slowly tinkering with getting arch up on a nyan-big, which is certainly small enough to do that
<spartan-s63>	mmarker: okay, i install windows first because it doesn't like any other operating systems. i hate that windows thinks it's going to be the only os on the system.
<spartan-s63>	mmarker: it's too greedy for my taste, but i like playing windows-only games too much to ditch it, unfortunately.
<case_of>	diegoviola: you should try to found one around 2.5lbs
<case_of>	diegoviola: 4lbs is heavy for a laptop
<jasabella>	do i mark the esp as primary or extended?
<deusstultus>	primary would certainly be recommended
<charlesatum>	yay, lots of corrupted logs
<charlesatum>	i think i'll have to blame chrome memory usage, again.

<al2o3-cr>	me
<welenad>	would anyone happen to have a solution, or at least know how to check on why it's not working?
<al2o3-cr>	0600
<al2o3-cr>	is thei no sudo group in arch
<dacoit>	al2o3-cr: alright then xauthority is fine. there goes my hunch. there is no sudo group by default, no.
<dacoit>	some people opt to make wheel the sudoers group
<phreakachu>	wheel is the usual choice
<phreakachu>	there's a commented out line in sudoers to enable that
<al2o3-cr>	right im in etc/sudoers
<dacoit>	always use 'visudo'
<dacoit>	dont edit directly
<al2o3-cr>	ok done via visudo
<strayarch>	i have my desktop infront of my router. so, i would like to make sure it is secure. i know having a gateway and desktop on the same machine isn't ideal, but it is what it is.
<strayarch>	i setup ip tables, but they have to be altered from the guide on arch linux wiki pages :3
<strayarch>	should of those rules still apply excluding for port 5000?
<strayarch>	all of those*
<al2o3-cr>	right on weechat now i can type
<al2o3-cr>	uncommented wheel now have sudo rights
<al2o3-cr>	now how to startx
<dacoit>	al2o3-cr: you dont need sudo right to start x.
<parkerr>	since quite a while now
<al2o3-cr>	no but i'm getting an error
<dacoit>	strayarch: i dont follow your question
<al2o3-cr>	unable to connect to x server connection refused
<al2o3-cr>	and i did what parkerr said
<welenad>	http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?p=5357405 <-- i am a bit of a noob, in what i still use, but i am striving to learn more and get better, and with this in mind, am planning a move to regular arch in the near future and hope the experience will improve my knowledge and skills.
<parkerr>	what i said was pretty much straight off the wiki (from memory)
<strayarch>	dacoit, if i have my iptables setup properly, then should a basic nmap scan show open ports? my desktop is infront of my router as a cavaet.
<al2o3-cr>	i get /etc/x11/xinit/xserverrc line 2: /usr/bin/x no such file or directory?
<thrice>	al2o3-cr: well, do you have /usr/bin/x ?
<al2o3-cr>	thrice: how do i tell?
<thrice>	"ls /usr/bin/x"
<parkerr>	al2o3-cr: is xorg-server installed?
<al2o3-cr>	thrice: no
<thrice>	ok, so install xorg-server
<al2o3-cr>	parkerr: lemme check
<thrice>	and respective drivers
<parkerr>	i usually just use the xorg metapackage to pull everything
<al2o3-cr>	ah, we got a gui ;p
<al2o3-cr>	parkerr: what is the metapacke called?
<dacoit>	strayarch: a simple nmap scan will show any port you open, e.g. 22,80,443,etc as open. more complex scans can be used to identify what ports are actively-filters as opposed to simply closed
<dacoit>	*filtered
<parkerr>	:/
<parkerr>	xorg
<parkerr>	pacman -s xorg links against everything thats needed (and a few extras you can cut outn later)
<parkerr>	*out
<al2o3-cr>	parkerr: ah ok thanks installing now
<parkerr>	if you are working theres no need
<al2o3-cr>	just touchpad isn't working so i installed xf86-input-synaptics thats all that wasn't working upto yet
<parkerr>	:)
<al2o3-cr>	how do you start networkmanager?
<parkerr>	!give al2o3-cr wiki networkmanager
<phrik>	al2o3-cr: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/networkmanager
<al2o3-cr>	thanks :)
<sudokode>	game of throoooones
<strayarch>	dacoit, thanks, i suppose i'm just worried about potential security issues. but, i've setup my ip tables as best as i can. and i am using grsec & paxd. sooo, onto scripts for keeping logs.
<dexter>	sudokode: you just made me lose the game
<dacoit>	strayarch: that stateful fw on the wiki is a real beauty, no kiddin. any work after that or trying to filter output has massively diminishing returns
<sudokode>	no
<dexter>	yup
<dexter>	bedtime :3
<d_garbage>	installing all of xorg isn't a great idea
<d_garbage>	!wiki xorg
<phrik>	d_garbage: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xorg
<al2o3-cr>	just one more question what do you install to have bash autocompletion?
<d_garbage>	guess
<dacoit>	lol
<d_garbage>	pacman -ss bash
<al2o3-cr>	ok
<d_garbage>	you can't miss it :)
<strayarch>	dacoit, i wasn't able to setup the entire firewall. it ended up blocking my internet sharing. i'm not too worried though. my ssh is key authentication and google oauth, combined with fail2ban. it nearly sounds like over kill :)
<al2o3-cr>	d_garbage: got it thanks ;p

<tigrmesh>	ntzrmtthihu777, hi
<spartan-s63>	so i'm having issues installing refind on my system. when i go to run "refind-install" i get an error that "there were problems running the efibootmgr program! you may need to rename the refind_x64.efi binary to the default name (efi/boot/bootx64.efi on x86-64 systems or ...) to have it run!"
<spartan-s63>	how should i go about fixing this issue?
<ntzrmtthihu777>	spartan-s63: this *is* a uefi system, right?
<ntzrmtthihu777>	other than that, i have no idea, never used refind, i use grub in efi mode :)
<davidosomething>	i can't connect to ethernet alongside my wifi -- networkmanager doesnt assign an ip?
<spartan-s63>	ntzrmtthihu777: yes, it's an msi gs70, which i understand has an extremely locked down uefi system. i'm reusing the windows esp as my arch esp.
<spartan-s63>	ntzrmtthihu777: i found out that grub supports booting kernels off ext4 file systems, so i might try grub instead.
<ntzrmtthihu777>	yep.
<ntzrmtthihu777>	i use grub and it is just dandy :)
<spartan-s63>	yeah, i've used it before too. maybe i'll try it again.
<spartan-s63>	i'll do that and see if it works. i'll come knocking again if it doesn't work ;)
<ntzrmtthihu777>	also, if you move the *.efi file as mentioned, it *should* work oob.
<se7enelv1>	i have a problem with plasma 5.3.
<se7enelv1>	i am unable to change the keyboard layout.
<se7enelv1>	error: cannot load libary /usr/lib/qt/plugins/kcm_keyboard.so:(/usr/lib/libstdc++.so 6z"version glibcxx+3.4.21 not found (required by /usr/lib/qt/plugins/kcm_keyboard.so))???
<se7enelv1>	anybody an idea how to fix that
<ntzrmtthihu777>	uefi looks there by default, but you can add new locations by writing to the nvram using efibootmgr, so you can have multiple efi bootloaders on one system recognized by the firmware
<nishantjr>	hi, any idea why i can't start virtualbox vms: "failed to create a session object", ns_error_factory_not_registered, most likely, the virtualbox com server is not running or failed to start.
<ntzrmtthihu777>	se7enelv1: install the package containing that shared library, do you have either kdebase-workspace or plasma-desktop package installed?
<se7enelv1>	extra/plasma-desktop 5.3.0-1 (plasma) [installed] ntzrmtthihu777
<se7enelv1>	ntzrmtthihu777: as fare as i understand the glibc version is wrong
<scimmia>	se7enelv1, that means it requires gcc-libs 5.1 from testing
<scimmia>	file a bug report
<spartan-s63>	ntzrmtthihu777: using grub instead worked perfectly! thanks!
<se7enelv1>	error: failed to prepare transaction (could not satisfy dependencies)
<se7enelv1>	:: gcc: requires gcc-libs=4.9.2-4
<halfwit>	krav: ping
<scimmia>	se7enelv1, right, you have to upgrade both
<scimmia>	ping arojas ^^
<scimmia>	eh, pretty late for him
<se7enelv1>	ok i'll try ... thanks for your help scimmia
<ntzrmtthihu777>	se7enelv1: remeber, partial upgrades are not supported
<ntzrmtthihu777>	spartan-s63: glad it worked for you :)
<spartan-s63>	ntzrmtthihu777: however, i am getting an issue when attempting to use os-prober to find my windows installation. it's not able to find the bootloader on the right partition. it searches on /dev/md126p3 but never on /dev/md126p2, which is where the windows bootloader is.
<spartan-s63>	ntzrmtthihu777: is this a situation where i need to manually configure the boot entry?
<ntzrmtthihu777>	what the hell kind of disk you have?!
<se7enelv1>	ntzrmtthihu777: but it is not recommended to upgrade against testing as well right?
<spartan-s63>	it's a raid 0 array
<ntzrmtthihu777>	se7enelv1: in for a penny, in for a pound.
<ntzrmtthihu777>	spartan-s63: ah
<se7enelv1>	ntzrmtthihu777: :)
<ntzrmtthihu777>	erm, you need to do the windows efi yourself
<spartan-s63>	okay, that's what i figured.
<ntzrmtthihu777>	se7enelv1: if you ain't -syu'd, you're gonna have a bad time :)
<strayarch>	 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ whats with people these days

<amcrae>	which window is active?
<holomorph>	amcrae: all i notice is a small difference in shadow :|
<holomorph>	i used kde today, it was fun
<tigrmesh>	yeah.  that bugs me too
<amcrae>	i will switch to kde next computer - or lxqt
<amcrae>	sick of gtk themes
<andronas>	why you sick of gtk
<scimmia>	amcrae, lol, i'm helping the guy figure out his pkgbuild and hadn't even looked at those screenshots
<amcrae>	i am avoiding work by google+
<rena>	i'm guessing the answer is "none of those are active because this is a window picker like alt+tab"
<amcrae>	it is getting desperate
<orbisvicis>	git moc(p) + latest pulseaudio == total brokenness, can anyone recommend any audio players that do not index (no libraries)
<lebenserfahrung1>	i use and android phone without a google account. hands down!!
<dacoit>	cmus
<lebenserfahrung1>	*an
<orbisvicis>	dacoit: cmus indexes
<holomorph>	orbisvicis: ffplay, mplayer or any of its forks
<dacoit>	orbisvicis: oh, my bad
<halfwit>	lebenserfahrung1: you're missing out on many wonderful things, but that's your choice to make.
<orbisvicis>	holomorph: way too spartan. i'd like some handy form of playlist, or at the very least navigation
<lebenserfahrung1>	halfwit: like?
<halfwit>	you've already made your mind up on the matter.
<orbisvicis>	enable a google account, and get a burner for whatever else
<orbisvicis>	proof by extreme exaggeration
<keenerd>	lebenserfahrung1: me too.
<lebenserfahrung1>	keenerd: cool.
<keenerd>	halfwit: the only thing you miss are some of the location services, afaik.
<dacoit>	you also miss the gentle guiding nudge of big brother
<lebenserfahrung1>	halfwit : have been there and done that.
<lebenserfahrung1>	dacoit: haha
<halfwit>	like i said, you've made your mind up already.
<lebenserfahrung1>	halfwit: because i've explored the other half extensively :-)
<braindamage>	keenerd: try unifiednlp, and you can get aggregate location services, even offline by downloading databases, it's a plugin api with many backends
<keenerd>	braindamage: i meant specifically the thing that tells people you call where you are.
<braindamage>	ah
<keenerd>	but thanks, i will look into that stack.
<lebenserfahrung1>	keenerd: what do you use for maps?
<grandpatrolling>	er, i just got a black screen on android netflix. anyone else have this problem? o.o
<grandpatrolling>	oh awesome, so it works on mah linux
<sh4tr>	i would like to move /home from / to a separate partition, what is the right procedure to do so
<dacoit>	sh4tr: format the target disk, mount it somewhere like /mnt
<dacoit>	sh4tr: then rsync /home to /mnt/
<dacoit>	sh4tr: and after confirming data transfer, log out of your user, into root. and blast /home/* and mount the device to /home
<dacoit>	and update fstab accordingly
<sh4tr>	thank you, i was forgeting fstab
<grandpatrolling>	oh. figured out my netflix problem in android.
<grandpatrolling>	color correction (night mode) kicked in
<grandpatrolling>	derp. should've thought of that, or at least looked at the time first
<derpadong>	derp you sir

<dacoit>	ls crembola
<crembola>	hey guys, i'm trying to install kde on a fresh base-sytem install of arch and it's been a while. i'm trying pacman -syy and then pacman -s kde and it says the target can't be found
<dacoit>	fuck it
<tom^>	crembola: dont ever do that
<tom^>	!give crembola sos
<phrik>	crembola: _never_ -sy when installing! http://gist.io/5660494
<tom^>	crembola: secondly the group kde doesnt exist any more.
<amcrae>	the wiki will have up to date instructions
<crembola>	thanks for the warning on -sy <package> but i had them as seperate things, so i don't think its the same
<tom^>	yes it is
<crembola>	tom^: any idea what package i should be looking for instead of kde?
<tom^>	crembola: -syy and then -s is exactly as bad
<amcrae>	!wiki kde
<phrik>	amcrae: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/kde
<crembola>	tom^: thanks, good to know! *tucks away for the caution list*
<amcrae>	it is all in that wiki link
<holomorph>	all hail the kde maintainer
<crembola>	alright, so instead of looking for the kde package i should be looking for plasma, assuming that i don't want a kde4 workspace?
<phagus>	any keepass users here? does anyone have an issue whereby the clipbaord doesn't automatically wipe itself?
<amcrae>	crembola: sounds right
<crembola>	thanks guys! you are always the best
<amcrae>	well i am...  not sure about holomorph
<holomorph>	amcrae: hm?

<phrik>	<allanbrokeit> i know how glibc does not work...   1) it is released, 2) it does not work <allanbrokeit> i has backup! <allanbrokeit> it happens because arch sucks <allanbrokeit> developers are useless <allanbrokeit> pacman is crap
<tigrmesh>	be nice to our devs!
<alxbl>	sounds like a cup of angry
<tigrmesh>	i know, right?  and our beloved pacman
<amcrae>	you give the angry guy op?!
<tigrmesh>	i have no patches
<tigrmesh>	or i'd send those instead
<amcrae>	good - i am already behind on patch review
<tigrmesh>	haha
<alxbl>	my favorite quote was "developers are useless".
<tigrmesh>	ok dacoit - time for your joke
<tigrmesh>	arch-related only

<gnea>	gehidore: especially when they're dead
<goatman>	is there a way to reinstall all currently installed packages from the repo?
<gehidore>	gnea: even when they're live...
<dacoit>	pacman -s $(pacman -qqn)
<dacoit>	why though
<gnea>	yes, they do poop a lot
<amcrae>	dacoit: it will magically fix things
<dacoit>	just add --magic
<tigrmesh>	dacoit, pacman -syu $(pacman -qqn)
<goatman>	dacoit, somehow my libuhd library was changed to 32 bit, and contained a shell script

<wasamasa>	i hope that's no password
<junka>	:d
<wasamasa>	though, spaces in passwords are weird
<jasabella>	protective mbr, 512 mib /boot/efi, 67 gib /, 100 gib /home sound reasonable?

<goatman>	maybe there was no actual shell, but somehow access was possible to the library.  i have also the binary which was uploaded
<goatman>	again, it is a 32 bit intel executable with a shell script
<jasabella>	btrfs hmmm
<jasabella>	is btrfs or ext4 recommended? or zfs even?
<sheep>	ext4 is the most stable though btrfs has some interesting features.  zfs is still a pain to use though, though it's a really nice filesystem
<dacoit>	it depends. ext4 as the default recommendation
<soulescaper>	ext4 is the recommended format
<d_garbage>	it's up to you
<n00balert>	what btrfs offers that zfs or lvm doesn't?
<n00balert>	well...lvm is not an fs.
<sheep>	it's supported by mainline linux and doesn't need to be recompiled by users for every update
<soulescaper>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_of_file_systems
<phrik>	title: comparison of file systems - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (at en.wikipedia.org)
<sheep>	if you really need zfs's features, you might want to check out freebsd
<n00balert>	that's my dilemma
<n00balert>	i have to maintain both bsd and linux
<n00balert>	freebsd because zfs is easy and solid...and linux because of everythingelse
<phreakachu>	another question is what does zfs offer that btrfs doesn't?
<soulescaper>	that's in the link i gave
<n00balert>	i don't know btrfs that well but i know zfs is production ready
<n00balert>	and last time i setup btrfs at home...it was a mess.
<jasabella>	i'm so slow installling all this stuff
<jasabella>	i'm only on after 3 after so like 3 hours
<jasabella>	lol
<jasabella>	step 3
<n00balert>	i'm usually slow too if i'm on irc
<phreakachu>	i've been using btrfs for ages without any problems
<moetunes>	is there a fsck for btrfs yet?
<shadowkatstudios>	btrfs is good - but if you're installing to anything older than a windows vista box, you have to re-init the partition table to boot from it.
<jasabella>	i'm learnig a lot as i go though so it's great
<phreakachu>	$ which fsck.btrfs
<moetunes>	so that'll be a yep then cheers
<phreakachu>	/usr/bin/fsck.btrfs
<phreakachu>	it exists
<phreakachu>	$ pacman -qo /usr/bin/fsck.btrfs                                                                                                ⏎
<moetunes>	not here but that's ok
<heftig>	phreakachu: open that file in a text editor
<phreakachu>	/usr/bin/fsck.btrfs is owned by btrfs-progs 3.19.1-1
<soulescaper>	in my experience btrfs performance is a little sluggish compared to ext4
<jasabella>	so i want defaults,discard,relatime, what other mount options for ext4 on a ssd?
<moetunes>	noatime
<dacoit>	relatime is fine
<phreakachu>	heftig, so it says basically "btrfs doesn't require fsck, this is a wrapper"
<phreakachu>	;)
<heftig>	exactly
<heftig>	(not a wrapper)
<phreakachu>	well it doesn't actually do anything except prevent errors from happening due to it not existing
<heftig>	yes
<dacoit>	compat layer
<jasabella>	ro for /boot/efi so i dont mess things up :)
<heftig>	jasabella: i mount the efi partition at /boot, not /boot/efi or anywhere else
<moetunes>	i'd feel kinda naked without a fsck for my filesystems
<moetunes>	.
<phreakachu>	well it actually elaborates further in the script
<heftig>	moetunes: why? the regular before-mount check is part of the kernel driver, while the repair utility is "btrfs check"
<phreakachu>	fsck on boot is only in case the log needs to be replayed after an unclean mount
<moetunes>	it's just a feels thing...
<phreakachu>	which isn't required for btrfs
<grawity>	i think even ext4 replays the log in-kernel, no?
<beest>	and btrfs check isn't something you're gonna be running often anyway
<grawity>	or is that still part of fsck.ext4?
<jasabella>	isnt there other stuf in /boot not related to efi though?
<grawity>	jasabella: very little
<grawity>	other distros put a copy of the kernel config there, but that doesn't disturb anything
<heftig>	mounting the partition at /boot lets you use gummiboot as your bootloader
<jasabella>	for an indecisive person, archlinux is a fun sort of hell lol
<soulescaper>	that's why i use archbang , saves you some decisions :)
<wasamasa>	isn't that officially dead?
<wasamasa>	i recall an announcement of its lead stepping down
<soulescaper>	well i installed it 2 weeks ago
<soulescaper>	so i guess it's not dead :p
<wasamasa>	you can install windows xp, too
<wasamasa>	doesn't change anything about it being unmaintained
<soulescaper>	uhm, archbang doesn t really needs to be maintained imo
<wasamasa>	lol, of course not
<soulescaper>	it s arch with openbox and some apps installed
<jasabella>	too bad crunchbang is no more
<wasamasa>	"i don't want any sekuriteh!"
<wasamasa>	http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=416493#p416493
<wasamasa>	but archbang, hmm
<jasabella>	is changing boootloaders painful?
<soulescaper>	yes that's why i switched to archbang, it s very similar to #
<grawity>	jasabella: not really
<wasamasa>	apparently that was crunchbang i was remembering
<grawity>	jasabella: somewhat easier with uefi though, since you can have both old & new installed at once
<jasabella>	yea from what i've read it seems to be just installing a new package, that's all
<jasabella>	editing a few config files
<jasabella>	so many mount options wow
<heftig>	jasabella: btrfs? ext4?
<jasabella>	ext4
<heftig>	noatime should be enough
<namarrgon>	ext4 now supports lazytime
<al2o3-cr>	could someone tell me how to get a wireless connection using network-manager or wifi-menu please?
<moetunes>	isn't wifi-menu eol
<moetunes>	run wifi-menu - select network - enter password - profit

<moetunes>	"vendor preset: disabled"
<al2o3-cr>	nope
<al2o3-cr>	any other suggestions?
<al2o3-cr>	do i have to start network service or something
<shadowkatstudios>	so can i use a mounted disk as the input for dd?
<moetunes>	apart from "get a better init system" no
<al2o3-cr>	it's a brand new install bout 3 hrs ago
<rtmf>	shadowkatstudios: mount it read-only?
<soulescaper>	you can use an iso file as input for dd
<xificurc>	is there a way to mount a stick/card/etc as a specific user instead of root?
<shadowkatstudios>	i want to clone a usb from a copy of linux on said usb to a different usb.
<moetunes>	everything is a file in linux so if=/dev/sda1
<rtmf>	shadowkatstudios: could always rsync instead
<shadowkatstudios>	like, it wouldn't break the everything, would it?
<shadowkatstudios>	i need to transfer the boot sector and stuff
<rtmf>	xificurc: see fusermount?
<moetunes>	dd needs/uses the same size as the partition tho
<rtmf>	shadowkatstudios: do a boot sector install after, grub-install /dev/fuu
<rtmf>	*foo
<rtmf>	lol
<john_f>	it will need an fsck at least. same as pulling the power on a mounted drive.
<rtmf>	>.> my Æ is showing apparently
<shadowkatstudios>	but it won't kill the input drive?
<rtmf>	i suggest rsyncing to a partition on the new device then doing a grub-install & grub-mkconfig or whatever on it (or investigating syslinux/etc.)
<john_f>	input wont care.
<rtmf>	you can't easily just dd it (i mean unless we're talking identical-sized flash drives, in whcih case unmount or read-only mount both and then dd the raw device)
<shadowkatstudios>	okay, excellent.
<rtmf>	it all depends on your bootloader, etc.
<moetunes>	there is no unmount in linux
<shadowkatstudios>	i'll write a script to remount / as ro, dd the raw device, then remount / as rw
<rtmf>	but with identical drives, umount/remount-ro both, and then dd if=/dev/sd? of=/dev/sd?
<xificurc>	rtmf: thanks, will look into that
<rtmf>	that way you copy all partitions and the boot sectors and partition map
<rtmf>	otherwise you have to intervene re: bootloader anyway w/ most bootloaders
<jasabella>	so i should set my esp as ro,nouser i suppose
<al2o3-cr>	can anyone help me get wifi working please?
<shadowkatstudios>	if i clone a 4gb usb to an 8gb usb directly, can i then partition the remaining 4gb?
<shadowkatstudios>	and will it boot, more importantly?
<moetunes>	al2o3-cr:  have you checked lsmod to see if the right module is loaded for it?
<john_f>	al2o3-cr: check rfkill, read the full boot log, or stop netcfg and systemctl start networkmanager, nmtui
<rtmf>	shadowkatstudios: if you clone it directly #1 it will boot most likely, #2 it won't let you do that, but a quick parted might fix it
<rtmf>	shadowkatstudios: you'd be copying the 4g-sized partition table
<al2o3-cr>	right ath9_htc driver loaded check, rfkill all on no check
<al2o3-cr>	john_f: how to stop netcfg?
<al2o3-cr>	john_f: how to stop netcfg?
<tylerdurden01>	al2o3-cr: you want to autoconnect your wifi to a single router?
<al2o3-cr>	tylerdurden01: just want to connect to wifi on a single router
<john_f>	er, netctl not netcfg
<moetunes>	i still use netcfg

<rtmf>	...the namespace is getting insanely cluttered (e.g. systemctl vs sysctl :-p)
<beest>	just forces me to get a little more creative with tab completion
<rtmf>	i went with aliases personally
<rtmf>	the "lower 26" as it were are carefully assigned ;)
<al2o3-cr>	right i just did this netctl stop-all; nmtui select network add psk and working by nm-applet way doesn't work i'm not bothered as long as i got a connection
<rtmf>	nmcli has gotten pretty usable lately too
<rtmf>	though the tab completion of names that need quoting is still...iffy
<ph0x>	you think arch linux will run on a toughbook?
<rtmf>	ph0x: likely yes, though it totally depends on which toughbook and then if any hardware gives you trouble, how good you are at dealing with it.  "arch linux" is a rather huge cross-section of possibility
<rtmf>	(so is "toughbook")
<rtmf>	i got a recent ubu release running on a random toughbook recently though so its possible
<rtmf>	(in theory)
<ph0x>	idk

<tazmain>	compiz is no longer in the offical packages what happened
<sheep>	tazmain: i thought it was gone from the official packages for a long time
<rtmf>	nobody's been maintaining it for ages, tazmain ... beyond that i'm not sure.  (as i am said quinnstorm, i kinda hate the situation but i haven't been able to get the time and energy at the same time to work on it)

<sheep>	iirc no

<quinnstorm>	at least as of #compiz-dev's latest chatter
<tazmain>	quinnstorm, sorry to here that man
<chandan>	namarrgon: ok. thanks for the information
<quinnstorm>	it beats being homeless...barely
<quinnstorm>	(having unfortunately done both)
<tazmain>	quinnstorm, well like its fine if that is the reason arch shoves it out. i mean if its not maintained i can't go ahead and try use it with plasma
<quinnstorm>	its really kinda badly unmaintained, i mean there are people talking about picking it back up, but its last known state was a half-rewritten mess
<quinnstorm>	too many people, too many egos, and they kicked out the few people who could keep the group on one user-focused track...for doing just that
<tazmain>	ish, well i am not fluent in c++ yet so i can't pick it up
<quinnstorm>	yeah, it was c originally, that's part of the problem
<quinnstorm>	lol
<tazmain>	why is c bad ? c is awesome
<quinnstorm>	not ad
<quinnstorm>	just
<tazmain>	quinnstorm, sounds like you knew what happened and politics and egos got in the way of the project
<quinnstorm>	the c++ rewrite is...only partly done, though at the time it started seemed promising...it appears to have devolved into mostly autoconverted code that doesn't work

<sheep>	g0ts1ck: for this you almost certainly want 'cut' or 'awk' or 'sed'
<g0ts1ck>	seheel
<g0ts1ck>	your cut
<g0ts1ck>	did it
<quinnstorm>	anyhow, compiz-fusion (once i walked away mostly) put out a few releases, but basically everyone gave up not long after "winning"
<tazmain>	quinnstorm, yeah life can be harsh. but its sad to here stuff like that happen
<lemonxah>	!ssh
<tazmain>	people can be idiots and selfish
<alund>	hi. is there is a conflict with the qt5 update, concerning libmm-qt5 and modemmanager-qt. ok to remove libmm-qt5?
<sheep>	tazmain: much of what compiz did can be handled by other window managers or compositors now, and its features weren't really geared towards usability
<quinnstorm>	i'd get into it but its way off-topic, and really what i need more than another shoulder to cry on is someone to say "hey come fly here, i'll give you a couch while you find a better job" :-p
<namarrgon>	alund: follow the default choice
<alund>	namarrgon: ty, but that means no update, so there is a issue to fix there :)
<namarrgon>	alund: post the complete output
<tazmain>	sheep, which window manager took over that
<sheep>	tazmain: many of them.  none are a direct continuation of compiz, but the compositing features in compiz did influence most major de wms like kwin and mutter
<alund>	namarrgon: https://paste.kde.org/payfzdprv
<phrik>	title: kde paste (at paste.kde.org)
<tomty89>	there are a tons of renaming of kf5 packages i think
<namarrgon>	alund: hm, libmm-qt5 is not in the repos, remove it
<namarrgon>	i.e. say y when asked
<bshah>	yep; libmm was renamed to modemmanager
<tomty89>	probably a remerge
<alund>	namarrgon: thanks, i just searched for it and found the same :)
<alund>	namarrgon: maybe the deafult should be changed to reflect that :)
<quinnstorm>	kde's effects are strongly based on compiz's work, to the point that initially the devs wanted to work on a cross-compatible plugin system...we agreed eventually that compiz's core, at the time, was not amenable
<tomty89>	compiz is so meh
<draggie>	hi. i am trying to run eclipse on the latest version of arch with the latest version of oracle's jdk. when i start eclipse it gives me a "this process is currently running setuid or setgid. this is not a supported use of gtk+" error and refuses to start. what is causing this?
<quinnstorm>	tomty89: agreed, i wanted it to be more, but see above
<namarrgon>	alund: one of the packages probably needs a replace= but i'm not sure what was replaced by what
<alund>	sounds likely, namarrgon :)
<junka>	is btrfs suitable only for ssds?
<tomty89>	no
<tomty89>	it's not even designed for ssds at the beginning

<phrik>	title: sdaf - pastebin.com (at pastebin.com)
<g0ts1ck>	why this aint working ?
<sheep>	g0ts1ck: because you don't understand what = does and what echo does.
<junka>	tomty89; is it suitable for flash drives too?
<sheep>	g0ts1ck: you probably want var=$(commands...) or var=`commands...`
<tomty89>	junka: *shrug* you can say so. there's an option "ssd" which would be enabled by default the non-rotational disk is detected

<tomty89>	draggie: hmm i just got eclipse with jdk8. runs fine
<sheep>	draggie: i can confirm what tomty89 said
<draggie>	ok, maybe its a bad download or something.  i'll check the file hashes and set things up again from the start to see if i can repeat it.
<draggie>	thanks for checking tomty89 and sheep
<agarnier>	hello all, considering that gdm, since version 3.16, refuses to launch a gnome session on my laptop (and given that it is the only desktop manager to do so), i deliberately kept it to 3.14.1-2 version, without any flaw until today, when the last update of wpa_supplicant kept gdm itself from prompting on boot.
<tomty89>	agarnier: i don't think gdm is the only one that can start gnome
<ph0x>	i dont like dms
<agarnier>	was wpa_supplicant the reason of so many bugs on last version of gdm (ahem… https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=195866), so that i just have to update both to last version to have everything work fine, or should i wait for a new update of gdm?
<phrik>	title: gdm login no longer works after upgrade to gnome 3.16 / pacman & package upgrade issues / arch linux forums (at bbs.archlinux.org)
<tomty89>	it's a display manager btw
<ph0x>	unless i  have multi users i dont use one
<agarnier>	tomty: certainly not, it’s just the most comfortable in my opinion ;)
<agarnier>	* tomty89
<tomty89>	agarnier: do you always do partial updates?
<tomty89>	coz you sounded like you do
<tomty89>	!syu
<phrik>	the -y will update the package list, the -u will prevent you from having a partially updated system
<agarnier>	only when my session won’t start.
<agarnier>	sooo, twice in two years?
<agarnier>	twice being one month ago and today…
<agarnier>	(gdm and wpa_supplicant, as i said :p )
<agarnier>	(that i downgraded for aforementioned reasons)
<tomty89>	!tias
<phrik>	try it and see™
<tomty89>	if it still doesn't work you should check journal
<tomty89>	hiding is not a solution
<tomty89>	btw
<tomty89>	wpa_supplicant was downgraded in repo
<tomty89>	https://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/commit/trunk?h=packages/wpa_supplicant&id=7562b98bd83fe5bce43e6952e0e922e7791e18b5
<phrik>	title: svntogit/packages.git - git clone of the 'packages' repository (at projects.archlinux.org)
<agarnier>	yep, i saw it.
<agarnier>	by downgrading, i meant a pacman versioning related downgrade, so from 1:2.3.1 to 2.4.1 (which, i admit, consists more in an update than a downgrade).
<tomty89>	so what's the problem and which one do you have problem
<tomty89>	*with
<tazmain>	so ghostery and noscript phones home with your ip. mmmm
<agarnier>	i have a problem with 1:2.3.1, stating that wpa_supplicant couldn’t up wlan0 for what i recall from journal -xe (didn’t save the log, my bad), which strangely kept gdm from launching.
<agarnier>	* journalctl
<tekken>	yck.
<jasabella>	wlan0 is now wlp3s0 heh
<tekken>	jasabella: i don't understand why they bothered to change nice simple device names to really annoying ones.
<tekken>	:|
<demonicmaniac3>	because they weren't persistent before
<demonicmaniac3>	now they are enumerated on which pcie slot/port they are so they never change
<qgel>	does anyone know if ambient light sensors in laptops generally adjust the screen backlight by themselves, or whether it is done in software? i'm trying to get mine to run, and i can get it to tell me the current brightness and it auto-adjusts the keyboard backlight, but not the screen backlight.
<demonicmaniac3>	before you had fun with eth0 and eth1 switching around
<demonicmaniac3>	much like sda/sdb instead of uuid
<tekken>	demonicmaniac3: you could always go in config and lock it in place manually.
<tekken>	:)
<demonicmaniac3>	yes you could write an udev rule yourself for your specific id of the device
<demonicmaniac3>	but that's what this does now
<demonicmaniac3>	persistent naming
<tekken>	demonicmaniac3: all i'm saying is the simple names could have been kept.
<agarnier>	maybe (just maybe) they could have specified a numeration of eth* and wlan* based on ordering of pcie slots/ports, keeping human-readable interfaces without random swaps :p
<tekken>	^
<demize>	you can just disable the persistent naming if you want, but it's perfectly human readable and more flexible.
<tekken>	enp0s19f2u5
<tekken>	is my ethernet device
<tekken>	-_-
<jasabella>	hmmm rfkill was set to softblock
<jasabella>	is this the defult?
<junka>	tekken; lol
<demize>	tekken: port 5, function 2, slot 19, port 0
<tekken>	demize: tell that to someone who enjoys jumbles of letters.
<jasabella>	nasty
<demonicmaniac3>	agarnier: no
<demonicmaniac3>	agarnier: because on some drivers and stuff you get eth0 and eth1
<demonicmaniac3>	instead of wlan0 and eth0
<demonicmaniac3>	this way now it's persistent and not up to the driver which may be utter bullcrap
<demonicmaniac3>	especically the blobs
<sheep>	you can use udev rules to chose custom names
<tekken>	we still have blobs for wireless lying around?
<sheep>	yes
<tekken>	mine just work these days.
<jasabella>	if i wnat to use networkmanager instead of netctl, i install that later right?
<jasabella>	it doesnt come on the boot iso
<sheep>	yes
<jasabella>	woo im online
<jasabella>	i'm so slow lol but i'm reading lots of documentation
<tekken>	i never can get proper uefi when installing arch anymore. ;[
<tekken>	oh well. i hate uefi anyways
<ox33>	morning
<chais>	in itself it's not a stupid idea. it just has some weaknesses in the execution
<ox33>	any idea what could cause slow download speeds under arch? when downloading big files in firefox, i get about 200kb/s. in my windows vm, i get 3 mb/s
<jasabella>	is archlinux about as much control as you can get for a linux system, short of compiling your own kernel?
<chais>	yes and no
<sledgehammer>	jasabella, you could compile everything e.g. lfs
<freaj>	hi jasabella, you can run your own kernel, there are many derivatives on aur/official packages (grsec, knock etc), but by default, it's a standard package
<sheep>	lfs gives you the most control though that requries compiling everything and doesn't come with a package manager
<chais>	arch is about being a simple, straightforward distro. being in control is a side effect
<tekken>	gent9o
<qgel>	is there a good resource for learning how to write a systemd daemon?
<jasabella>	qgel: lpi
<chais>	wat
<chais>	"hey i wanna write up a quick daemon" - "here make this 300$ course and take the 100$ exam"
<sheep>	qgel: man systemd.unit; man systemd.service
<chais>	^
<chais>	the wiki might also contain some hints
<qgel>	i'm looking for resources on writing the actual daemon, not the service files.
<sheep>	qgel: you don't write a systemd daemon.
<qgel>	something like in daemon(7)
<sheep>	you just write an ordinary daemon
<qgel>	but more in-depth
<jasabella>	i meant the book mind you
<sheep>	though systemd has some apis that can be useful like notifying systemd that a service is ready or using systemd's socket activation
<sheep>	but you don't usually need those
<qgel>	if i understand daemon(7) currect systemd comes with some functionality to write what they call 'new-style-daemons', no?
<draggie>	hi. i am trying to run eclipse on the latest version of arch with the latest version of gnome3. when i start sublime 2 it gives me a "this process is currently running setuid or setgid. this is not a supported use of gtk+" error and refuses to start. what is causing this?
<draggie>	i had the same problem with eclipse, but after reinstalling oracle jdk and eclipse, it fixed itself.  as far as i know, sublime does not depend on oracle jdk.
<jasabella>	i have apue back home
<sheep>	qgel: very little.
<sheep>	it's really limited to sd_notify
<sheep>	and a few other small functions
<jasabella>	tlpi = the linux programming interface, apue = advanced programming in the unix environment --- they got nice chapters
<sheep>	you still have to make it daemonize yourself
<jasabella>	on daemons
<sheep>	qgel: man sd_daemon
<sheep>	it's basically those 5 functions
<qgel>	jasabella: thanks, i'll look into that
<sheep>	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17954432/creating-a-daemon-in-linux may also be useful
<phrik>	title: c - creating a daemon in linux - stack overflow (at stackoverflow.com)
<qgel>	hmm i thought one of the advatages of  systemd was that it can do the demonization for me
<earnestly>	man 7 daemon
<sheep>	no.  one of the advantages of systemd is that it can properly track processes that daemonize
<jasabella>	no, systemd tells you what it expects of you, i.e. how to write it :p
<earnestly>	they wrote that manual which explains everything a correctly daemoning process needs to do
<earnestly>	better init systems have disallowed "daemonising" as it's n ugly hack
<earnestly>	for over a decade now
<qgel>	earnestly: thats what i read, and it says "none of the initialization steps recommended for sysv daemons need to be implemented."
<junka>	i installed kernel 4.0.1
<qgel>	i took that to mean that systemd would handle it for me. is that incorrect?
<sheep>	that's because systemd starts them as child processes that don't fork
<earnestly>	qgel: yeah, there's no need, that's why some tools were made to force forgrounding bad daemons
<arch-tk>	alright
<sheep>	or it can do that
<jasabella>	i'll still be double forking and setuid()ing hrmph!
<arch-tk>	guize
<earnestly>	anyway, cgroups can track daemons reliably now
<earnestly>	jasabella: still perfectly tracked, how every many times you fork
<earnestly>	ideally you'd write your daemon to never background and send a signal when it's ready instead of relying on the exit status of the parent to do that
<earnestly>	e.g. systemd-notify, there's a bunch of ways systemd will accept a kind of "ready state" signal
<qgel>	alright, thanks for the pointes. i'll go read up some more before i bother you with more superficial knowledge :p
<jasabella>	off to wokr
<jasabella>	ciao :d
<arch-tk>	wokr?

<cloudef>	it's mournday
<arch-tk>	you want a job to find you
<arch-tk>	if a job finds you it's much better than a job you find
<arch-tk>	generally if a job finds you, a job wants you, and when a job wants you, you own the job and the job doesn't own you

<junka>	btw i cant reproduce that, works fine on me
<mehdi__>	hi fellas
<utack>	tomty89 same as windows control center, you need to know what is where, or you are lost
<tomty89>	utack: nah i mean it deps on some many stuff
<utack>	probablly on gnome-desktop, and gnome desktop comes with everything?
<mehdi__>	i want to migrate from ubuntu to arch , and managed to install kde4 on vm but now i want to installed it on laptop but want to know is there any possible way to create and iso from an existing os that i can install taht one with no problem?
<tomty89>	utack: the biggest problem is it dep on cheese
<tomty89>	directly
<mehdi__>	i dont want to install manjaro or antergos
<mattapp13>	when using efistub and a fastboot uefi board, how can i reboot into my bios
<arch-tk>	mehdi__: why do you need to do that?
<arch-tk>	mehdi__: installing arch and getting kde up and running is piss easy
<utack>	yeah that is "funny"
<grawity>	mattapp13: `systemctl reboot --firmware-setup`
<grawity>	mattapp13: i think that's only available in systemd-git, though
<namarrgon>	junka: simplescreenrecorder

<grawity>	mattapp13: ...assuming by "my bios" you meant the settings screen.
<mehdi__>	arch-tk, well installing is not that easy since i come from ubuntu , plus i wanna install it on my new laptop  and our internet is sux
<sheep>	installing arch takes 5 minutes if you write down what you need to do before you start
<tomty89>	utack: and the second one is grilo
<utack>	what does that do?
<tomty89>	"framework that provides access to various sources of multimedia content"
<tomty89>	no idea

<grawity>	it's a thing that apps like totem use, to retrieve stuff from lan, from video websites, etc.
<arch-tk>	mehdi__: then copy the packages from the cache
<yeowang>	mehdi__: maybe this is something you can make use of: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/archiso

<utack>	mattapp13 is efistub faster or just easier to configure?
<grawity>	a little of the former; definitely not the latter
<z1lt0id>	hi guys i noticed when doing a pacman update today it wont let me. it comes up with the following error. looking for conflicting packages...
<z1lt0id>	error: failed to prepare transaction (could not satisfy dependencies)
<z1lt0id>	:: lib32-cracklib: requires cracklib=2.9.1
<z1lt0id>	should i download it manually off the mirror and install it locally?
<mehdi__>	yeowang, http://imgur.com/jdyszx9
<phrik>	title: imgur (at imgur.com)
<utack>	it sounds like you need some script to link the currnet kernel name to a constant file like "kernel" so the efi always knows what to boot?
<grawity>	z1lt0id: no; you already have 2.9.1
<grawity>	z1lt0id: the upgrade however wants to install 2.9.4
<grawity>	z1lt0id: so, you need to uninstall lib32-cracklib, upgrade, then check if you can install a more recent lib32-cracklib (from aur?)
<yeowang>	mehdi__: what was the command?
<mattapp13>	a kernel, backup initramfs and ucode image
<mehdi__>	pacman -s kf5 kf5-aids
<tomty89>	nooo
<tomty89>	plasma!

<namarrgon>	no, i mean, have you rebooted into the native system already?
<david89>	hello. i'm trying to figure out why gnome-terminal and rxvt-unicode are giving me different $paths. does anyone have any idea what files they could be parsing differently?
<mehdi__>	namarrgon, yes installation is finished
<namarrgon>	mehdi__: "pacman -s archlinux-keyring" then retry
<orbisvicis>	anyone know if cmus supports podcasts ?
<tomty89>	seems groups and meta-package of plasma and kde-application has no absolute consistency
<tomty89>	sounds good "note that the kde4 plasma desktop is currently in maintenance mode, and is expected to reach eol in august 2015." :o
<mehdi__>	i wish pacman could guess the packages  and namarrgon it pass thanks
<mehdi__>	well kde 5 plasma released recently but i heared its awsome
<mattapp13>	if you install a group ( say plasma ), and want to remove all packages from that group at a later date, apart from those which are dependancies, how can  you do that?
<mehdi__>	why pacman does not guess the package?(tab completion)
<sheep>	mehdi__: did you try using tab completion manually>
<namarrgon>	that's your shell, not pacman guessing
<shadowkatstudios>	okay, if i remount / as ro, what everythings will that break?
<earnestly>	shadowkatstudios: try it and see
<sheep>	shadowkatstudios: why do you need to remount it ro?
<tomty89>	mattapp13: -rus
<shadowkatstudios>	sheep, so i can clone it using dd using the os itself, of course
<shadowkatstudios>	totally a great idea.
<tomty89>	wat
<t-ask>	how can i disable usb drivers? by removing /lib/modules/4.0.1-1-arch/kernel/drivers/usb/storage/usb-storage.ko.gz ?
<sheep>	first of all, use a livecd for that
<tomty89>	t-ask: blacklist perhaps
<tomty89>	t-ask: why?
<sheep>	second, you probably don't want a block-level image.  you probably want a file level image (like tar with all attributes and ownership stuff preserved)
<t-ask>	tomty89: just for hardening the server
<mehdi__>	sheep,  that's what i always do seems im so lazy at typing
<shadowkatstudios>	sheep, i know what i want.
<sheep>	mehdi__: is bash-completion installed?
<tomty89>	t-ask: lol
<tomty89>	t-ask: don't forget uas then
<mehdi__>	its just a fresh install so i think not
<mehdi__>	namarrgon, is fish the sell available in repo?
<namarrgon>	pacman -qs fish
<namarrgon>	pacman -ss fish
<namarrgon>	woops
<mehdi__>	what is q?
<mehdi__>	and s
<tomty89>	t-ask: if you don't want usb at all, you probably remove the controller dirver
<t-ask>	tomty89: sounds good. so re/moving them /lib/modules/4.0.1-1-arch/kernel/drivers/usb/storage/ is fine then?
<sheep>	man pacman
<sheep>	t-ask: don't
<sheep>	t-ask: they'll be reinstalled when you upgrade the kernel
<tomty89>	^
<mehdi__>	i only know syu :d
<sheep>	t-ask: instead, use modprobe's blacklisting functionality
<tomty89>	the thing is...would that really increase security?
<namarrgon>	mehdi__: then you are missing out on a lot of features, read the manual
<sheep>	tomty89: probably not
<sheep>	unless your server is somewhere were people have physical access to attach usb devices
<tomty89>	maybe udev rules might help if it's actual permission problem
<sheep>	but, if they can do that, then you have much bigger problems
<tomty89>	yeah i mean they can modprobe anyway
<tomty89>	if they break it
<tomty89>	bah if you wants it anyway just compile a kernel with no usb support at all lol
<tomty89>	don't forget to buy a set of ps/2 mouse and keyboard though
<t-ask>	i don't need usb at all, because the server is a kvm. i know i is not possible to secure it 100%. just making it harder for training purposes is fine with me
<sheep>	t-ask: how does removing usb support secure it?

<_zoopp>	hey, might someone be able to give me a hand on this? https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=196998
<phrik>	title: wrong scancodes for ctrl, super and alt on keyboard / kernel & hardware / arch linux forums (at bbs.archlinux.org)
<tomty89>	_zoopp: all of them show as 42?
<_zoopp>	yes, let me check again just in case
<_zoopp>	tomty89: yes, all of them show 42
<t-ask>	tomty89: sure, that's the best way to build a custom kernel. i guess, blacklisting is a good temporary solution to prepare a custom kernel. do you have a good source on kernel hardning?
<t-ask>	as i said, i just want to teach myself a bit of steps to consider on server hardening. maybe someone has a good source on this topic
<sheep>	t-ask: focus on hardening the userspace, not the kernel
<sheep>	userspace is where most exploits happen
<earnestly>	lol not anymore
<earnestly>	not only do they exploit the wealth of bugs in the kernel but are also starting to target firmware
<mehdi__>	namarrgon, im using the zsh but still not guessing the packages i even installed bash-completion :(
<sheep>	bash-completion only does stuff if you use bash
<earnestly>	t-ask: get grsecurity as a baseline
<tomty89>	_zoopp: what if you run showkey with -s?
<_zoopp>	tomty89: all 4 of the keys output 0x2a followed by 0xaa (when releasing the key)
<tomty89>	o.o
<tomty89>	no idea then...
<_zoopp>	ah, thanks for trying
<tomty89>	_zoopp: maybe you can file a bug report on usbhid
<_zoopp>	tmomty89: on the arch bugtracker? i'm asking because the issue manifested on an android table as well
<_zoopp>	tablet*
<tomty89>	_zoopp: no kernel upstream
<_zoopp>	tomty89: alright, i'll look into it
<tomty89>	that's probably a pretty weird keyboard though...
<utack>	skype seems to be a little more stable the last half year now. before it crashed on my at least twice a day, now maybe twice a month
<utack>	well until gcc5 abi comes along, does that break commercial programs using the old one, or will they co-exist?
<tomty89>	_zoopp: btw the last paragraph of `man showkey` might be interesting to you
<_zoopp>	checking it out now
<tomty89>	_zoopp: though i'm not sure if it applies to usbhid
<tomty89>	_zoopp: coz the kernel param is only for atkbd
<arch-tk>	:(
<tomty89>	:)
<_zoopp>	tomty89: i'll reboot and check it out, i'll be back and let you know how it went
<bneutrality>	i'm updating an arch system system today... after well over a year of no updates. do you guys recommend anything different from just acting like it was a month? (i was just checking the site for everything that might cause a hiccup in the update)
<bneutrality>	[sorry if this is a silly/rtfm question]
<grawity>	over a year? *might* be painful
<grawity>	but the latest breaking change was a bit older than that
<grawity>	iirc
<tomty89>	!reinstall
<phrik>	a reinstall isn't a solution to your problem, period.
<earnestly>	update from a live iso if you want to be safer
<tomty89>	earnestly: how does that help?
<earnestly>	tomty89: you have access to a pacman that works
<tomty89>	oh okay
<_zoopp>	tomty89: that option as no effect, i'll check if there's something similar for usbhid
<tomty89>	_zoopp: that's normal unless you are using some quirky convertor
<tomty89>	_zoopp: but doesn't seem like there's an equivalence for usbhid

<chais>	i'm searching for plasma, an lapack replacement for multicore architecture. however if it exists in the repo it's drowned in the flood of kde packages
<chais>	i searched for 'plasma lapack', 'plasma blas', 'plasma atlas', 'plasma math' but none of these yield results
<grawity>	search for lapack then
<grawity>	generally it would have "an lapack replacement" in its description
<grawity>	like aur/magma does.
<chais>	lapack brings up blas, cblas, openblas, magma, but no plasma
<grawity>	probably not in repos then
<chais>	oo
<chais>	dammit
<braindamage>	write a pkgbuild
<chais>	but that'll take time
<tomty89>	hire someone to write it for you
<chais>	i had begun with it anyway but couldn't believe it's not in the repo
<chais>	or at least the aur
<rtb>	hey all! i find that ~/tmp/odch gets created in home directory. if i delete it i find it again on reboot. this odch file is a socket. how can i investigate further?

<tomty89>	rtb: oracle?
<demonicmaniac3>	b00k3r: you cannot mount a blank disk

<grawity>	well technically packet writing and mrw exists
<grawity>	but it's rare
<demonicmaniac3>	grawity: you mean a dvdram?
<b00k3r>	when i insert the blank cd, other partitions mounted disappear..
<grawity>	demonicmaniac3: no, generally rewritable cds/dvds
<grawity>	though i guess dvd-ram is more optimized for that
<demonicmaniac3>	grawity: yeah but you generally clear unless you attach a new session on the end
<tomty89>	/dev/dvd+rw o.o
<demonicmaniac3>	and the new session is  a new filesystem basically
<grawity>	demonicmaniac3: which part of "packet writing" did you miss
<demonicmaniac3>	 the whole
<tomty89>	b00k3r: other partitions mounted?
<tomty89>	b00k3r: disappear where?
<b00k3r>	tomty89: when i insert blank cd
<tomty89>	where, not when
<grawity>	demonicmaniac3: you pretty much get to use a cd-rw as a block device, to some extent (i think it's required to have udf though)

<tomty89>	maybe mate expect libudf to be installed *shrug*
<tomty89>	so that it can prompt "do you want to format your blank disc" when it's ejected
<hexhaxtron>	i'm loosing my internet connection about 3 or 4 times an hour and it takes about 5 minutes to have it back... what should i do?
<tomty89>	*inserted
<tomty89>	or some brasero plugin
<tomty89>	idk
<halosghost>	udf :d
<tigrmesh>	hexhaxtron, does it work in a different os?
<hexhaxtron>	tigrmesh, i don't know... i can't use another os...
<tomty89>	wifi or ethernet
<hexhaxtron>	wifi
<tomty89>	did you started multiple agents explicitly
<tomty89>	eh my grammar is getting poor
<tomty89>	!netctl
<phrik>	users having issues with netctl are advised to try alternatives such as systemd-networkd, networkmanager, or connman.
<hexhaxtron>	i was using wifi-menu before to have the connection back but now wifi-menu says aborted, and now i think i'm using networkmanager.
<tomty89>	either pgrep or systemctl status :p
<tomty89>	make sure all netctl sh*t is stopped
<tomty89>	but you sound like you had same problem when you only had networkmanager?
<hexhaxtron>	tomty89, yes, it's the same problem.
<tigrmesh>	hexhaxtron, are you sure they not both running?
<tigrmesh>	hexhaxtron, nothing else on that machine?  try a livecd / liveusb of some other distro.  you can start with the arch installer.  did you install recently?
<hexhaxtron>	i'm not sure.
<phutchins>	good morning all. on a fresh install, trying to use lvm, when trying to reboot into my system after install from usb stick, i am getting unable to find root device 'uuid=f8c.....'. i've googled, and tried the suggestions about mkinitcpio but have had no luck. anyone know what i might try next?
<tomty89>	follow your journal maybe
<tomty89>	journalctl -f
<tomty89>	phutchins: you mean you have lvm hook and regenerated the image already?
<hexhaxtron>	tigrmesh, can i try something else without rebooting and running a livecd?
<tigrmesh>	hexhaxtron, would need to reboot
<hexhaxtron>	tomty89, journalctl -f has nothing relevant.
<tomty89>	keep watching until it disconnect. or use -b instead :p
<bretzel>	i there, i try to compile ncurses but it fails on "ld -lutil"  - but i do have it at " /usr/lib/libutil-2.21.so*;  /usr/lib/libutil.so@;  /usr/lib/libutil.so.1@;" ( only shared ? )
<phutchins>	tomty89: so i did uncomment the hook as suggested in another post, the one with lvm2. not sure about regenerating the image. what image? the boot image?
<tomty89>	hexhaxtron: pasting output of `systemctl` might help
<hexhaxtron>	tomty89, i think this is the latest entry and i lost my connection several times since then: mar 25 17:38:32 richland org.gtk.private.udisks2volumemonitor[2276]: index_parse.c:190: indx_parse(): error opening /run/media/hexhaxtron/e9c4a5c9-c885-4217-aa66-678db5d91828/bdmv/backup/index.bdmv
<tomty89>	phutchins: initramfs
<tomty89>	phutchins: if you edit the file you have to run mkinitcpio again
<tomty89>	hexhaxtron: ...
<phutchins>	ah ok and mkinitcpio rebuilds initramfs?
<phutchins>	didn't know i had to rebuild... trying now
<phutchins>	thanks so much for your help!!
<tomty89>	yeah, -p linux if it's repo kernel
<phutchins>	tomty89: ok great.
<phutchins>	finally got around to replacing ubuntu on my desktop with arch. :)
<tomty89>	hexhaxtron: perhaps you should need to `man journalctl`. shouldn't tell you about -f so early maybe
<tomty89>	hexhaxtron: btw `systemctl` list known units
<phutchins>	tomty89: hum, didn't seem to work. rebooting back into chroot and going to check the options i have for the hook
<hexhaxtron>	tomty89, sorry, i'm back again...
<hexhaxtron>	tomty89, http://sprunge.us/dhxz
<chais>	grawity: should i include examples in the package?
<tomty89>	hexhaxtron: wpa_supplicant.service is suspicious
<tomty89>	hexhaxtron: did you enabled/started it explicitly with systemctl?
<hexhaxtron>	not explicitly.
<hexhaxtron>	it wasn't me.
<tomty89>	btw you're not running networkmanager now?
<hexhaxtron>	i think i am, no?
<tomty89>	...
<hexhaxtron>	i don't know...
<tomty89>	i see only wpa_supplicant.service related to network connection
<hexhaxtron>	tomty89, i got network manager applet near the clock.
<phutchins>	tomty89: i had two hook lines uncommented, commented the second one ( the one without lvm2 ) and redid mkinitcpio. trying again
<phutchins>	looks like that did it! got a login prompt  now :)
<bneutrality>	hey guys, i'm updating an arch system after about 1.5 years; when i syu do i want to ignore dependency stuff? because it seems to be circular
<tomty89>	hexhaxtron: pgrep -a networkmanager
<hexhaxtron>	tomty89, 1364 networkmanager
<namarrgon>	bneutrality: what is the output?
<rtb>	grawity, indeed i do run an opendc hub :) so its benign then?
<tomty89>	hexhaxtron: ehh
<phutchins>	tomty89: thanks again for your help...
<bneutrality>	namarrgon, error: failed to prepare transaction (could not satisfy dependencies):: haskell-syb: requires ghc=7.6.3-1
<tomty89>	phutchins: np
<namarrgon>	bneutrality: which repo is haskell-syb from?
<bneutrality>	aur
<tomty89>	hexhaxtron: maybe you can try disable/stop the wpa_supplicant service
<namarrgon>	bneutrality: you'll probably want to remove all the haskell packages that are not in the repos, update and then reinstall what you need
<bneutrality>	well i'm dumb
<tomty89>	hexhaxtron: not sure what spawned nm though
<tomty89>	hexhaxtron: do you really see "networkmanager" in pgrep? or just the applet

<hexhaxtron>	job for wpa_supplicant.service canceled.
<bretzel>	please again, ncurses fails to compile : "ld -lutil" : no such file.... ?
<hexhaxtron>	tomty89, networkmanager appears in pgrep
<namarrgon>	bretzel: abs?
<hexhaxtron>	and i got the applet too.
<tomty89>	hexhaxtron: no idea what's changed. maybe an update/downgrade
<tomty89>	hexhaxtron: i think you can do the reload. or reboot
<hexhaxtron>	tomty89, should i wait some time to see if systemctl stop wpa_supplicant fixed it?
<bretzel>	namarrgon: abs, does  mean nothing to me, so what do you mean ?
<namarrgon>	bretzel: are you using arch? are you building the package from the abs?
<tomty89>	hexhaxtron: why wait, take action(s) :p
<sledgehammer>	bretzel, why are you compiling ncurses anyway?
<bretzel>	namarrgon: ah! sorry :-) no direct gnu ftp download. i need extended colors and mouse version 2

<lmat>	i'm having some trouble with rdesktop. i'm connecting to a microsoft windows 7 machine which is on a domain.
<namarrgon>	bretzel: why are you not using a pkgbuild?
<lmat>	i use  rdesktop -u lmat -d ads.ou.edu 10.23.4.5; rdesktop shows up with
<lmat>	module = lmatdesktop; (i don't know what that means) then asks for a password.
<lmat>	i give the password, then it shows "started connecting" "connecting to 127.0.0.1 5900" "error -problem connecting"
<bretzel>	namarrgon: because i was not aware before you suggest me that i could edit the build scripts and put the options there :-)
<lmat>	i guess rdesktop is setting up a local tunnel of some sort using the username and domain i supplied (?), then attempting to connect to that tunnel and provide the password i give and failing? i don't see any stdout or stderr output.
<namarrgon>	bretzel: see what the official arch package does to make it build and adapt it
<tomty89>	hexhaxtron: better check how nm is started btw. i don't think any de would spawn it. did you start it manually or put it in xinitrc or something
<namarrgon>	why the heck does the pkgbuild provide specific .so?
<lmat>	there are other modules available besides 'lmatdesktop': 'rdpany' 'freerdp-any', and 'sesman-x11rdp'
<tomty89>	hexhaxtron: it doesn't even have a .desktop file in xdg autostart paths
<lmat>	the last one allows a username and password. i've tried to put in my username and password a number of ways there (specifying also the domain, etc.) with no success. if anyone uses this tool successfully, please let me know which module you use, and any configuration you use?
<bretzel>	namarrgon: it is still strange to see  the message "ld:  cannot find '-lutil' ... "-lutil"  is "-l" part of the lib name given to ld ??
<namarrgon>	bretzel: you would need to tell us how you are building it
<bretzel>	btw, i wrote a_color needs to be 16 bits - it's not. i meant 15 bits... "./configure --prefix=/usr " whitout any options first...
<earnestly>	bretzel: sounds like you're passing the options to the wrong thing
<earnestly>	or you're looking in the wrong place
<bretzel>	earnestly: the "thing" is the root of the ncurses source subdir...where configure script is ...
<namarrgon>	did you look at the pkgbuild?
<earnestly>	you're not giving us enough information
<earnestly>	"ld not finding xyz" is a very common issue

<earnestly>	ian lance is worth following
<earnestly>	he wrote gold
<hexhaxtron>	tomty89, i also got this: # pgrep -a wicd
<hexhaxtron>	1066 /usr/bin/python2 -o /usr/share/wicd/daemon/wicd-daemon.py
<hexhaxtron>	1085 /usr/bin/python2 -o /usr/share/wicd/daemon/monitor.py
<earnestly>	wicd is dead, kill and move on
<halosghost>	earnestly: that's not really my point
<earnestly>	halosghost: your point is silly anyway
<halosghost>	how?
<halosghost>	nim is supposed to be safer and simpler than c
<earnestly>	is it not?
<halosghost>	defaulting to something that is malformed in the underlying language seems like an incredibly poor decision to me
<earnestly>	(although not simpler certainly)
<bougyman>	by whose version of simple?
<lmat>	i just ran ss and see that my rdesktop has a connection to the microsoft windows 7 machine :-o i ran tcp dump and was surprised that every keypress resulted in traffic...so there's an authentication problem i guess.
<earnestly>	it's not *malformed*, for fucks sake
<bougyman>	it's more complex than c.
<earnestly>	using signed integers is not bad
<earnestly>	bougyman: i think he meant easier
<bougyman>	when you compile nim to c, wouldn't it be just as unsafe (or as safe) as c? not less or more.
<halosghost>	right
<bretzel>	earnestly: tell me i am doing stupid thing: i've copied the pkgbuild to an ncurses/ dir. but makepkg refuses to proceed because of a "pgp signature" ... i am missing something here :-)
<halosghost>	bougyman: that's the issue
<earnestly>	bougyman: it can place more stack guards and bounds checking, which you can also do in c, but it's implicit
<kilo`byte>	apparently my bluetooth isn't working correctly. i have the bluetooth daemon running, but it seems to not be detected in bluedevil and in bluetoothctl
<lmat>	gee, i wish i could see what the heck is going on...is there a way to make rdesktop verbose?
<kilo`byte>	the dongle is however listed in lsusb
<kilo`byte>	am i doing something wrong? or is something broken?
<bretzel>	* pgp,,,
<bretzel>	gpg
<earnestly>	c itself is not type safe, a nice definition of what "type safe" is comes from the types and programming languages book.  "a type safe language means a programmer can read the manual and learn everything they need to know".  a non-type safe language depends on memory layout, which is platform specific heh
<halosghost>	heh
<bougyman>	lisp is both.
<bougyman>	well, common lisp.
<bougyman>	you get optional type safety.
<bougyman>	the ruby author talked about adding the same for ruby 3.0
<earnestly>	the c standard's stance on overflow is mostly because it can be implemented in different ways, so it gets away with calling it "undefined"
<earnestly>	this is why c is so prevalent, it makes it much simpler when you can just do whatever the hell you like in implementing it :p
<halosghost>	lool

<earnestly>	which makes it suitable for working on a large array of hardware
<bougyman>	well it didn't have much competition for what it can do.
<earnestly>	trying to implement haskell's calling convention alone on some architectures can be a hassle
<bougyman>	and other than rust today, still not much.
<earnestly>	bougyman: fortran and algol at the time
<earnestly>	or yeah, even lisp
<bougyman>	lisp can't get down to the metal as easily.
<bougyman>	well, common lisp can't.
<bougyman>	unless i fire up my lisp machine from '83
<archtitan>	im using mpd but its not showing up in pavucontrol. it uses "mpd" as user
<earnestly>	yeah, it's a bit eeh.  like pl/i
<kilo`byte>	archtitan: pulseaudio is user specific
<kilo`byte>	so when the pulseaudio daemon runs as your user, the mpd won't be able to connect
<earnestly>	archtitan: if you want to use a mpd user you need to publish the pulse server over a socket and have mpd connect to that
<bougyman>	you know the last time i had a problem with my window manager was never?
<earnestly>	bougyman: did you try without tsched?

<earnestly>	bougyman: okay
<hexhaxtron>	tomty89, i killed wicd but it still disconnects...
<earnestly>	ffs, htop.
<hexhaxtron>	can anyone else help me?
<earnestly>	hexhaxtron: dmesg will tell you how it disonnects, -x
<earnestly>	also, it helps to go back to basics and then build up
<hexhaxtron>	earnestly, dmesg doesn't have anything...
<earnestly>	hexhaxtron: dmesg will tell you about disconnection events
<hexhaxtron>	it doesn't...
<earnestly>	paste it, dmesg -x
<bougyman>	what are you using to connect, hexhaxtron ?
<hexhaxtron>	earnestly, http://sprunge.us/evhi
<hexhaxtron>	bougyman, networkmanager i think.
<bougyman>	kern  :info  : [614215.394452] wlo1: deauthenticating from 00:62:2c:13:99:48 by local choice (reason: 2=prev_auth_not_valid)
<bougyman>	what do you think that is?
<bougyman>	it's a disconnect event.
<earnestly>	there's also  local choice (reason: 3=deauth_leaving)
<earnestly>	so now we get to go back to basics
<earnestly>	hexhaxtron: what kind of auth does the network are you trying to connect to use?
<bougyman>	hexhaxtron: wpa_cli list_networks
<earnestly>	bougyman: wait, before that
<hexhaxtron>	earnestly, wpa2 with preshared key.
<earnestly>	hexhaxtron: okay, do you mind posting pstree?
<bougyman>	earnestly: i'm just curious if nm uses std wpa_supplicant networks or makes it's own list with wpa_supplicant daemons called on some runtime conf (like netctl/netcfg did)
<hexhaxtron>	http://sprunge.us/cudz
<hexhaxtron>	bougyman, failed to connect to non-global ctrl_ifname: (null)  error: no such file or directory
<bougyman>	looks like std wpa_supplicant.
<bougyman>	hexhaxtron: add a sudo before it.
<hexhaxtron>	bougyman, i'm root already.
<bougyman>	er wo... no ctrl interface at all?
<earnestly>	hexhaxtron: okay, stop wpa_supplicant and networkmanager
<hexhaxtron>	how will i chat?
<earnestly>	hexhaxtron: i thought you were on another device... since you can't connect?
<earnestly>	how are you talking in irc if you can't connect?
<bougyman>	he is connected now, accd to that dmesg
<earnestly>	blegh
<earnestly>	hexhaxtron: my suggestion for now is to go back to basics, make sure stuff works manually, then build up.  to do it basically see: !wpa_supplicant and !wpa_cli factoids
<earnestly>	hexhaxtron: and remember that you can't have multiple wpa_supplicants running, so if you use network manager, let it manage the processes
<bougyman>	my suggestion is use wifish
<earnestly>	i'd rather not recommend wrappers until the base case is solved
<earnestly>	because otherwise it's just magic and you learn nothing
<hexhaxtron>	it takes about 5 minutes to get my connection back.
<hexhaxtron>	it disconnects more than 5 times per hour.
<bougyman>	part of wifish's job (working towards 2.0) is to teach wpa_cli/wpa_supplicant, too. but i understand your point.
<earnestly>	that could be a router issue then or driver problem
<earnestly>	esp if it's wl
<bougyman>	and it sounds like you have a driver or router issue, but that could just be an aggressive wifi manager.
<bougyman>	and network mangler is pretty aggressive.
<bougyman>	so get rid of that layer and see if the situation remains.
<earnestly>	how does that make sense?
<bougyman>	how does it make sense that network manager can disconnect for reasons of its own?
<bougyman>	it can. it does.
<earnestly>	bougyman: it's not disconnecting though, not networkmanager anyway
<earnestly>	if it was, dmesg wouldn't say much :p
<bougyman>	hexhaxtron: has this always happened with that card?
<bougyman>	i've had funky deauths on particular kernel revs that go away on subsequent kernel updates (or kernel downgrades).
<hexhaxtron>	earnestly, i tried to kill /usr/bin/wpa_supplicant -u but it returns again.
<earnestly>	hexhaxtron: because networkmanager is using it, which is why i said stop that first
<hexhaxtron>	bougyman, it's been like this for some time, since about 3 weeks ago.
<earnestly>	hexhaxtron: quick sanity check, do you know what wpa_supplicant effectively does?
<bougyman>	hexhaxtron: but before that it was fine?
<hexhaxtron>	earnestly, i don't.
<earnestly>	as in, what it's for
<hexhaxtron>	bougyman, actually, it's like this since 4 or 5 days ago but before that it would only disconnect rarely.
<xarxer>	hey all.. when installing something from aur, for example from a git-repo, and the installation fails for some reason. is it possible to persist the downloaded data and just try to reinstall? i.e. now i'm cloning a huuuge repo again just because the build failed...
<earnestly>	hexhaxtron: okay, so wpa_supplicant is a supplicant (the router has one too) which basically opens a tunnel to the router (like an ssh tunnel) which lets you communicate with the router as if it had no encryption
<xarxer>	(using yaourt btw)
<earnestly>	hexhaxtron: that's all it does
<earnestly>	i don't know why we don't use ssh for everything :(
<thrice>	xarxer: the srcdir shouldn't be removed by default, i think
<thrice>	could be a yaourt option doing it
<bougyman>	depends on how dump the pkgbuild is.
<bougyman>	i've seen some dumb ones.
<scimmia>	xarxer, either don't use yaourt or set a sane srcdest or builddir
<xarxer>	thrice, maybe not, but it seems yaourt just downloads again anyway
<bougyman>	yaourt isn't doing that.
<xarxer>	hmm, okay..
<bougyman>	where is the pkgbuild?
<scimmia>	yes, yaourt is the problem here
<bougyman>	yaourt only downloads dist files and then runs makepkg
<thrice>	bougyman: what?  that's not the default makepkg trait
<bougyman>	it doesn't do any crazy git stuff.
<scimmia>	and removes them after the run
<thrice>	it might certainly pass the option to makepkg to remove it
<scimmia>	it also downloads them to tmpfs
<bougyman>	it doesn't
<bougyman>	it's still there in /tmp/yaourt-username/thing
<thrice>	he's talking about a git source entry
<xarxer>	i haven't editet yaourtrc at all (i.e. it only contains comments), so i don't know what its working dir is
<bougyman>	xarxer: /tmp/, then.
<scimmia>	xarxer, like i said, set a sane srcdest
<bougyman>	you can use yaourt just to dl source then do the rest manually.
<xarxer>	yes, /tmp/yaourt-tmp-$user
<bougyman>	yaourt -g <packagename>
<bougyman>	and it'll just download the source to ./<packagename>
<bougyman>	then you can cd <packagename> and run makepkg manually.
<xarxer>	so when yaourt failes to build something, is the cloned repo/downloaded files still in /tmp, or does yaourt delete them?
<scimmia>	or set s sane srcdest and don't worry about all of that
<bougyman>	it doesn't delete them.
<xarxer>	weird that it by default downloads it again then..
<bougyman>	go look in that /tmp/yaourt-tmp-$user/ dir.
<hexhaxtron>	earnestly, i'm reading this: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/wireless_network_configuration
<phrik>	title: wireless network configuration - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<bougyman>	not weird. again, where is the pkgbuild for this?
<earnestly>	hexhaxtron: i wouldn't
<earnestly>	but, feel free
<xarxer>	bougyman, /tmp/aur-tmp-$user/packagename/pkgbuild
<xarxer>	yaourt-tmp-$user i meant
<spyhawk>	xarxer: you can also keep the sources in a separate directory. see makepkg.conf.
<bougyman>	xarxer: can ya tell me what the actual packagename is?
<xarxer>	bougyman, cling-git
<thrice>	scimmia: even in /tmp , it shouldn't go away (unless a reboot happens, or so)
<scimmia>	thrice, except yaourt does clean it up
<xarxer>	thrice, no, it doesn't.. but yaourt still overwrites it when i try to -s the package again
<earnestly>	oh dear, that pkgbuild does stuff
<xarxer>	yeah it's cloning a couple of hundred megs to start with :p
<thrice>	scimmia: i figured :-)
<earnestly>	xarxer: that's fine, if you didn't use aur helpers and kept the pkgbuilds around, it wouldn't need to do that a second time
<earnestly>	since it will keep mirrors
<xarxer>	earnestly, no, but that's the point though, wouldn't it be smart of yaourt to _not_ re-download stuff in case of a build fail?
<thrice>	yes
<scimmia>	xarxer, so like i said, set srcdest and it won't
<xarxer>	scimmia, you sure?
<scimmia>	yes, i'm sure
<archtitan>	hi. i just configured mdp to run as my user, but now pavucontrol says it cant connect to pulseaudio anymore
<xarxer>	scimmia, will try it then.. thanks :-)
<kilo`byte>	archtitan: is pulse running (ps aux | grep pulseaudio)
<archtitan>	kilo`byte: yeah it's running. i'm playing music on mpd as we speak. pavucontrol works fine but when i start it while listening to music i get the error
<archtitan>	kilo`byte: error is: connection refused
<kilo`byte>	thats a pretty generic error that can mean just about everything
<kilo`byte>	pulse is probably not listening for incoming connections or something
<namarrgon>	are you running pa system-wide?
<archtitan>	namarrgon: no idea actually. how it pulse even started? it's not in my systemd services
<bretzel>	earnestly: \o/ !! you are my hero :-) hehehehehehe!! i have what i need manual  compile-install  ncursesw6 from the pkgbuild !!!
<kilo`byte>	archtitan: it is usually started by your desktop environment
<bretzel>	..and also thank to you namarrgon !!
<archtitan>	kilo`byte: well, that's weird. i'm using i3 but it's not started from there. but it is active.
<kilo`byte>	archtitan: hmm weird, yeah, in i3 it should not automatically start (my i3 config starts pulse on login)
<namarrgon>	bretzel: yw, now post some screenshots!
<archtitan>	kilo`byte: hm. it's not, here. any idea how to find out?
<bretzel>	namarrgon:  i take your request! :-) ( trying flicker... )
<dreampwnzor>	hi guys, anyone has a jack + pulseaudio setup? i have an expensive external sound card and everything connects to it, but the sound quality of system sounds (e.g. chromium youtube) is fairly bad. maybe there's an equalizer i'm missing, or some secret place to set bitrate?
<bellbreaker>	broadcom-wl has to be updated after every kernel update. how do i download the package in advance such that i don't have to build it on another machine and transfer it manually?
<namarrgon>	don't remove it each time?
<mrelendig>	bellbreaker: just use dkms
<mrelendig>	seriously
<archtitan>	well i be damned. i can't find out how pulse is started. it's not in systemd, not started by i3 and not an /etc/xdg/autostart either.

<earnestly>	chais: it's kind of a per-build system thing
<sudokode>	ask #systemd or #pulseaudio
<godginrai>	!grab bougyman
<phrik>	godginrai: tada!
<earnestly>	chais: because some build systems will override your makepkg settings or environment but expose options to set things
<earnestly>	or just ignore them
<tomty89>	alexoundos: you loaded 30-dbus.sh though
<alexoundos>	tomty89, yes
<alexoundos>	is it wrong?
<vfw>	sudokode: was i supposed to substute my user-name?  (instead of "user"?)
<chais>	earnestly: buildsystem meaning?
<tomty89>	alexoundos: i don't think so
<earnestly>	chais: whatever build system the project uses
<chais>	ah. so make, maven or whatever
<alexoundos>	tomty89, so do i have dbus properly running?
<earnestly>	or cmake or autotools, or scons, or ninja, or some hand rolled script, or make, or ...
<chais>	ay
<vfw>	sudokode: (i ran the systemctl command as root)
<earnestly>	or opam or cabal or cargo or npm or...
<earnestly>	i hate everything :d
<godginrai>	lol
<chais>	so there's some sense in setting it inside the pkgbuild
<earnestly>	not really
<sudokode>	vfw: the point of --user is to run it as your user
<lyonsb>	i was reading suckless recently, and i believe they called it "auto*hell"
<sudokode>	alexoundos: how are you running start-pulseaudio-x11
<sudokode>	are you using sudo?
<scimmia>	vfw, why would you run a systemctl --user command as root?
<earnestly>	chais: set it however it works for the build system, e.g. cmake -dcmake_cxx_compiler=clang++
<cloudef>	lyonsb: automake is still better than most of those
<earnestly>	chais: or export cxx=clang++
<vfw>	got it...
<tomty89>	alexoundos: seems to me yes
<chais>	or rather, the pkgbuild needs to generate a make include file
<alexoundos>	sudokode, type "start-pulseaudio-x11" in terminal, without sudo
<chais>	which is expected to contain that setting
<earnestly>	chais: set it in makepkg.conf and then figure out how to fix each package if it's a problem
<cloudef>	s/automake/autotools/
<alexoundos>	sudokode, in "xterm"
<sudokode>	alexoundos: how about this service you're using to start x
<sudokode>	lets see thst
<earnestly>	chais: pkgbuild does nothing special
<sudokode>	and how did you start/enable it
<earnestly>	chais: see https://gist.github.com/earnestly/bebad057f40a662b5cc3
<phrik>	title: a brief overview of the process involved in creating a pacman package. (at gist.github.com)
<earnestly>	chais: including the example at the end
<lyonsb>	hmm.  !snark
<chais>	earnestly: i'm trying to bulid plasma. which expects a customised make.inc file in its basedir
<chais>	it comes with an .example file
<alexoundos>	sudokode, i user this method: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd/user#automatic_login_into_xorg_without_display_manager
<phrik>	title: systemd/user - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<chais>	i'm just looking for defaults i should incorporate
<alexoundos>	sudokode, i use*
<sudokode>	"the factual accuracy of this article or section is disputed."
<sudokode>	well that's a good sign
<earnestly>	chais: you'll just have to deal with it then
<mrelendig>	just use sddm
<earnestly>	chais: e.g. http://sprunge.us/zswo?sh
<vfw>	my only goal is to have audio turned up by default.  "alsactl store" does not work.
<sudokode>	alexoundos: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/start_x_at_login
<phrik>	title: start x at login - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<sudokode>	try that instead
<vfw>	i just want audio turned all the way up for mythtv
<tomty89>	alsactl store?
<sudokode>	vfw: check pactl or pavucontrol
<alexoundos>	sudokode, without systemd, right?
<sudokode>	the output for that might be lower than the system audio
<tomty89>	vfw: what does that have to do with your problem
<vfw>	ok
<sudokode>	alexoundos: right
<sudokode>	so just disable that unit you're using
<alexoundos>	sudokode, ok, i'm going to try it
<sudokode>	make sure you've got stuff in ~/.xinitrc
<sudokode>	!wiki xinitrc
<phrik>	sudokode: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xinitrc
<alexoundos>	i have a working xinitrc, i don't think i need to edit it
<balloonface>	on this: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/arch_compared_to_other_distributions#fedora
<phrik>	title: arch compared to other distributions - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<balloonface>	what does it mean by a ports system?
<sudokode>	balloonface: ports is a build system used by freebsd
<balloonface>	so something similar to portage on gentoo?
<sudokode>	no
<sudokode>	portage is a package manager inspired by ports
<alexoundos>	sudokode, my xinitrc http://pastebin.com/bghdsfbb
<phrik>	title: xinitrc - pastebin.com (at pastebin.com)
<sudokode>	arch's pkgbuilds and makepkg concepts are inspired by ports
<tomty89>	ports™ system
<tomty89>	alexoundos: cd ~ is funny
<balloonface>	my understanding (maybe it's wrong) was that freebsd ports were package management where it would compile from source if it had to
<alexoundos>	tomty89, maybe
<mrelendig>	freebsd supports both binary and source packages
<tomty89>	eh export in background and .xinitrc...?
<tomty89>	(none is relevant though)
<alexoundos>	tomty89, sudokode, ok, rebooting, brb
<rhino-sic>	i just did an update on my mbp, and now the trackpad is not working.  i have no idea where to start poking around to debug the issue
<tomty89>	why reboot!?
<godginrai>	tomty89: who's doing cd ~?
<tomty89>	alexoundos
<godginrai>	:(
<sudokode>	balloonface: whereas portage has one idea: build from source (except for some package) and pacman is a full binary package manager that comes with tools for building packages from source
<charlesatum>	awesome name, i would install it
<godginrai>	charlesatum: lol
<tomty89>	rhino-sic: you mean it doesn't move the cursor at all?
<tomty89>	!wtf thefuck
<phrik>	tomty89: community/thefuck
<rhino-sic>	tomty89: yeah
<teraflop>	the fuck reminder thingy?
<alexoundos>	sudokode, tomty89, rebooted with this method https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/start_x_at_login without systemd. still same problem. start-pulseaudio-x11. connection failure: connection refused
<phrik>	title: start x at login - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<tomty89>	rhino-sic: eh start with journalctl -k / dmesg?
<tomty89>	rhino-sic: can it be some software/hardware lock
<tomty89>	there was cases that kde disable some trackpad by default
<rhino-sic>	tomty89: i am on gnome, but i see what you are saying
<tomty89>	i don't recall macbook has lock button though
<godginrai>	alexoundos: you *do* know that `cd` with no arguments changes to $home, right?
<alexoundos>	godginrai, yes
<tomty89>	rhino-sic: you can try a kernel downgrade
<tomty89>	godginrai: i didn't lol
<balloonface>	sudokode: when it's saying that it has a ports system whereas fedora doesn't, what is it meaning?
<alexoundos>	godginrai, does it matter in case of pulseaudio not running??
<balloonface>	it has a system for automated building from source?
<godginrai>	alexoundos: then why do you use `cd ~` ?
<godginrai>	tomty89: then why did you find `cd ~` funny? o.o
<sudokode>	balloonface: i'm not sure
<tomty89>	godginrai: because he puts it in .xinitrc
<tomty89>	without other cd
<sudokode>	!give balloonface abs
<phrik>	balloonface: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/arch_build_system
<godginrai>	tomty89: ah
<earnestly>	alexoundos: you still haven't checked the journal where the errors go (syslog)
<alexoundos>	godginrai, this xinitrc is ~5 years old and changed a lot and i don't remember why "cd ~" was relevant back then
<tomty89>	lol
<godginrai>	alexoundos: that can lead to problems.  when you make changes, you should always check to make sure the rest of the code makes sense.  otherwise you can create unexpected bugs.
<peregrine`>	hi, i frequently have this problem when trying to build an aur package: missing package() function in /tmp/yaourt-tmp-peregrine/<package name>/./pkg_build.  is there something i can do?
<alexoundos>	godginrai, sure, but i didn't use pulseaudio at that time
<earnestly>	peregrine`: complain to the maintainer
<earnestly>	peregrine`: they had over a year to fix this (it was warning every time)
<earnestly>	(maintainer of the package that is)
<alexoundos>	earnestly, last 40 lines of journal http://pastebin.com/mbdwemqp
<phrik>	title: journalctl -b -n 40 - pastebin.com (at pastebin.com)
<peregrine`>	earnestly: thank you, i’ll do that.
<earnestly>	may 04 18:28:27 300v5a pulseaudio[2282]: [pulseaudio] pid.c: daemon already running.
<earnestly>	there's no real errors here
<alexoundos>	well, i started and stopped pulseaudio 2 or 3 times at this boot.
<earnestly>	it's just saying that there's nothing that provides bluetooth, and that's fine
<earnestly>	starting and stopping shit isn't going to help
<earnestly>	linux in generally is thankfully quite deterministic
<earnestly>	general*
<alexoundos>	yep. so what are my next steps?
<godginrai>	alexoundos: and?  it's not like i was saying that cleaning up your code fixes pulse.  my point is that by cleaning your code, you make it less likely that you will run into problems with any software.  sure, you'll still run into bugs that are in the software itself, but you will not be running into as many problems caused by your own hand.
<alexoundos>	ok
<mrelendig>	i would just use a dm instead of reinventing the wheel badly
<earnestly>	alexoundos: which user owns the current pulseaudio process?
<alexoundos>	alex
<tekken>	o hai.
<earnestly>	alexoundos: and pacmd(1) can't connect to it?
<alexoundos>	earnestly, indeed pacmd can connect: http://pastebin.com/dratpiw2
<phrik>	title: pacmd can connect to pulseaudio - pastebin.com (at pastebin.com)
<earnestly>	alexoundos: so, what's the problem?
<alexoundos>	but pavucontrol cannot.
<alexoundos>	and mpv cannot
<mrelendig>	starting it from the same terminal?
<alexoundos>	yes
<earnestly>	alexoundos: that seems really strange, if pacmd can connect to the server then ...
<earnestly>	alexoundos: -syu maybe
<earnestly>	it's very unlikely an issue
<alexoundos>	did ~12 hours ago
<earnestly>	but if pacmd then everything should be able to connect
<holomorph>	session broken? user groups?
<alexoundos>	http://pastebin.com/hckxbhda

<phrik>	title: groups alex - pastebin.com (at pastebin.com)
<earnestly>	that makes no sense, your system is whack
<earnestly>	what the hell
<earnestly>	why are you in so many groups?
<holomorph>	wtf
<holomorph>	fix that
<alexoundos>	ok, what should i remove?
<alexoundos>	or leave?
<wasamasa>	everything except users and wheel
<holomorph>	leave users and wheel
<alexoundos>	what about pulse and pulse-access?
<holomorph>	what about them
<alexoundos>	keep or not?
<holomorph>	"did i stutter?"
<holomorph>	why the hell did you add them in the first place
<earnestly>	i still can't think of a reason why pacmd would work but pavucontrol or mpv wouldn't
<alexoundos>	don't remember really. ok, i restart in order to make group changes to take effect.
<alexoundos>	ah, changes are applied without restarting.
<earnestly>	relog
<rhino-sic>	tomty89: i just rebooted, and noticed that the trackpad works on the login screen
<rhino-sic>	it must be a user setting that got messed up
<therealfakemoot>	so i'm encountering a strange problem with my arch install. i used the march 1 install disk and everything went perfectly smooth: i was able to use wifi-menu to generate a profile and succesfully connect to the internet. the rest of the install went flawlessly. however, once i booted into the actual installed os, my wireless adapter doesn't appear in /dev. it works perfectly fine on the livecd. did i miss something? i'm currently booted
<therealfakemoot>	 into windows, so it's not like i can run any diagnostics right this second.
<alexoundos>	now alex user is only member of wheel and users.
<mrelendig>	therealfakemoot: network adapters never shows in /dev
<therealfakemoot>	oh, good.
<alexoundos>	still the problem remains.
<alexoundos>	pacmd connects and mpv doe not
<alexoundos>	does* not
<mrelendig>	what is the actual problem?
<chais>	what's the proper way to check which package provides a certain package?
<mrelendig>	chais: file you mean?
<earnestly>	chais: what is the real question?
<therealfakemoot>	mrelendig: journalctl reports "the wpa supplicant failed to start"
<therealfakemoot>	which doesn't tell me a whole lot
<sd1001>	pkgfile can be used
<mrelendig>	therealfakemoot: dmesg etc
<chais>	that. packages can define provides
<niel>	therealfakemoot, restart dhcp?
<mrelendig>	chais: pacman -s works
<mrelendig>	-ss even
<therealfakemoot>	mrelendig, i'll take a look at dmesg.
<niel>	try using wpa_supplicant
<mrelendig>	so does expac + some parsing
<therealfakemoot>	niel, i did, but i wasn't sure how to list the available interfaces
<therealfakemoot>	which is when i went looking in /dev, which is apparently incorrect
<holomorph>	therealfakemoot: first off, an installed system doesn't have networking automagically configured
<holomorph>	second:
<holomorph>	!netctl
<phrik>	users having issues with netctl are advised to try alternatives such as systemd-networkd, networkmanager, or connman.
<therealfakemoot>	holomorph, no, it doesn't. but i used wifi-menu, and netctl.
<niel>	therealfakemoot, iw dev
<chais>	so pacman -qs blas will find me the package providing blas, even it 'blas' is not part of the pkgname or pkgdesc
<therealfakemoot>	niel, sweet, perfect
<dan39>	do it manually first
<mrelendig>	therealfakemoot: ip a, ip l
<mrelendig>	!netctl
<phrik>	users having issues with netctl are advised to try alternatives such as systemd-networkd, networkmanager, or connman.
<niel>	nmapplet is best
<holomorph>	netctl is trashy and i suggest you avoid it
<niel>	except that its stupid buggy
<alexoundos>	earnestly, holomorph, the problem remains. pulseaudio is unusable (mpv and pavucontrol fail to connect) except pacmd that is able to connect.
<therealfakemoot>	that's disappointing.
<earnestly>	alexoundos: you'll have to stop all instances of pulseaudio and start them in a controller manner using `pulseaudio --start --log-level=debug --daemonize=false` (or if false doesn't work, 0, because pulseaudio(1) doesn't define 'bool')
<therealfakemoot>	cause the installation tutorial kinda uses/recommends it.
<earnestly>	controller/controlled
<dan39>	therealfakemoot: i had the same issues
<alexoundos>	earnestly, pulseaudio --kill ?
<therealfakemoot>	yeah, dan39?
<holomorph>	yeah, it's a shame
<earnestly>	or /usr/bin/kill pulseaudio or pkill pulseaudio
<dan39>	used wifi-menu during setup, worked
<dan39>	once installed didnt work
<earnestly>	alexoundos: and make sure it doesn't autospawn
<earnestly>	alexoundos: you may have to configure that
<dan39>	tried re-doing it several times n all
<niel>	i make sure to get nm-applet and gdm/xfce during the install so i dont have to bother with any of that
<alexoundos>	earnestly, well, i killed all instances and it doesn't appear again in "ps aux|grep pulse".
<earnestly>	stop fucking using ps aux
<holomorph>	pgrep pulse
<therealfakemoot>	alright. i've got a handful of diagnostic commands and logs to examine. if i use the livecd to chroot into the install, acquire connman or networkmanager, then i should be able to figure something out.
<earnestly>	alexoundos: unless you can tell me what 'aux' does right now
<earnestly>	alexoundos: what a and u and x
<earnestly>	does
<niel>	therealfakemoot, do you plan to use a display manager?
<niel>	cause it will be much easier
<dan39>	ended up trashing that, added the wifi to /etc/wpa_supplicant/interface.conf and just enabling dhcpcd on boot, and that works great haha.
<therealfakemoot>	i do.
<earnestly>	as i thought
<niel>	what de do you like?
<dan39>	thats just cuz i have laptop that never moves n stuff
<therealfakemoot>	well, i wanted to give kde/plasma a spin.
<therealfakemoot>	but i'd settle for openbox
<therealfakemoot>	i don't need much.
<niel>	gimme a second
<therealfakemoot>	this isn't my first arch install
<holomorph>	why do you have to "settle" :|
<therealfakemoot>	it's just the first time i've had so much trouble with networking
<niel>	one sec breh
<earnestly>	alexoundos: as a bonus, pgrep works everywhere from solaris to busybox
<alexoundos>	earnestly, ok
<earnestly>	it's also easier to type and more reliable, what more could you need?
<sudokode>	apparently pgrep works more often than pulseaudio
<earnestly>	where as grepping ps will result in false positives as grep matches itself
<dan39>	of course if you actually moved your laptop around you want a better solution than what i do :p
<therealfakemoot>	dan39: this is a desktop. there will be no moving.
<earnestly>	sudokode: his pa works, but this system is fucky
<dan39>	why wifi-menu?
<therealfakemoot>	i don't care if i have to statically configure the dang network.
<sudokode>	why does grep match itself anyway?
<dan39>	get a damn wire!
<sudokode>	seems like a waste
<niel>	sudo pacman -s networkmanager network-manager-applet gdm kdebase-plasma xorg-server <insert gpu drivers>
<niel>	therealfakemoot, ^
<earnestly>	sudokode: because grep pulse becomes the process grep with the arguments pulse in ps
<niel>	do that then tell me
<earnestly>	sudokode: these | execute | in | parallel
<earnestly>	sudokode: but they will usually wait() for data, stdin whatever
<sudokode>	if pid == this_pid; then next pid; else foo; fi
<dan39>	i think sudokode must be trolling
<therealfakemoot>	niel, alright, i think i can handle that
<sudokode>	to pseudocode it in bash
<niel>	gpu drivers can be found on the xorg wiki
<earnestly>	sudokode: that's terrible
<sudokode>	it's not so terrible
<earnestly>	it's fundamentally bad
<earnestly>	to do tht
<sudokode>	why?
<earnestly>	because you're altering the semantics of the command based on outside global state
<sudokode>	ls doesn't show you relative paths by default because they're unnecessary
<earnestly>	making it basically inpure
<sudokode>	that's a weak argument
<earnestly>	consistency is important if you want to ever reason about a system
<sudokode>	i guess the only reason would be because you're doing something like uhhh
<sudokode>	vimpager
<earnestly>	if commands suddenly do different things based on outside factors, they are going to subvert that reliablity
<sudokode>	where you're setting up vim for each scenario of input
<earnestly>	what if you want grep to match itself?
<sudokode>	well, if we're entertaining that thought
<sudokode>	-a
<earnestly>	why artificially limit it instead of just using the right tools instead?
<sudokode>	nope, already taken
<earnestly>	i don't understand how you can munge this logic together, ps is not the only tool we have
<alexoundos>	earnestly, holomorph, now i stared pulseaudio using "pulseaudio --start --log-level=debug --daemonize=false". pacmd responds, mpv freezes, pavucontrol also freezes. there are some messages about suspended streams. http://pastebin.com/tgg5wptw
<phrik>	title: pulseaudio --start --log-level=debug --daemonize=false - pastebin.com (at pastebin.com)
<sudokode>	well i've already said why it doesn't work
<sudokode>	so technically i'm not
<earnestly>	alexoundos: there are no issues in that output
<sudokode>	there should be no need to start pulseaudio ever
<sudokode>	this is why i'm confused
<earnestly>	i also really hate that, so i'll it
<earnestly>	i hate autostart, i hate the desktop autostart and i hate the socket autostart.  my own pulseaudio package doesn't ship any of those things.
<sudokode>	but assuming a vanilla pa
<thrice>	earnestly: why?
<earnestly>	until i can say "enable" or "disable" like every other normal service, i don't want it autostarting
<earnestly>	thrice: because i'm too stupid to follow what's going on when software does that
<alexoundos>	pavucontrol's window doesn't load at all
<earnestly>	alexoundos: what kind of errors does pavucontrol print?
<sudokode>	have you considered #pulseaudio
<thrice>	it's a pretty small set of things that autostart, and i'd argue that there are a few which make sense regardless (including pulse)
<earnestly>	it also makes debugging issues a lot more complicated when you now have to worry about autospawn
<thrice>	or better, is there ever a time where it shouldn't start when x starts
<alexoundos>	earnestly, only these: http://pastebin.com/4qv26zrq
<earnestly>	thrice: sure, you'd argue that.  i would not.  i like the consistency of "things start because i ask it to"
<phrik>	title: pavucontrol errors - pastebin.com (at pastebin.com)
<earnestly>	thrice: if and when we can actually control dbus services, i won't allow any of them to start
<alexoundos>	earnestly, after these messages it doesn't show any window
<sudokode>	thrice: the concept pulseaudio is based around is that of a desktop where each user, even at login, requires its own set of resources, such as audio
<sudokode>	the reason things like audio are required to autostart (by default anyway) are things like screen readers
<earnestly>	alexoundos: everything seems fine, my only guess now is probably audio driver.  see #pulseaudio like sudokode said
<sudokode>	accessibility is a big pusher here
<earnestly>	sudokode: that model also sucks.  you can make pulseaudio run as its own user publishing over a socket and every user can just use that.
<earnestly>	that's where pulse was going, but they stopped
<sudokode>	earnestly: doesn't that break the seat model?
<alexoundos>	earnestly, ok, anyway, thak you for the help
<sudokode>	because systemd
<earnestly>	sudokode: nope, it just acts as a server which accepts clients
<thrice>	if i load a mixer to control pulse in my environment, i'd expect it to start pulse, i guess
<sudokode>	yeah, i remember when systemd used to endorse a system daemon
<earnestly>	like everything else which behaves like a server, there's no seat issues
<earnestly>	a seat is a client
<thrice>	or better, "sound" is something i think should always be loaded
<earnestly>	thrice: you're probably right, and in stuff like gnome based os' or ubuntu or other such distros, that's a good idea
<sudokode>	thrice: well it is. you can always talk to alsa directly
<tomty89>	<3
<sudokode>	the audio capabilities are there
<sudokode>	the idea behind pulse is to add userspace logic to that audio
<thrice>	earnestly: distro is irrelevant
<thrice>	if gnome uses pulse, it should start pulse, not doing so is being silly
<tomty89>	i hope soon the service way can be the default. they need kdbus for that do they?
<bneutrality>	very short stupid q: if i press "enter" at a y/n question from pacman, does it take it as "y"?
<tomty89>	thrice: desktop file
<earnestly>	thrice: it's not, some distros are catered towards people who are less interested in the system, and that's fine.  you can autostart all kinds of software there
<mrelendig>	bneutrality: it selects whatever is capitalized
<earnestly>	not on arch though, because nothing else in arch works like that.
<namarrgon>	bneutrality: the upper-case option is the default
<earnestly>	this is pure pulse forcing policy on users
<mrelendig>	bneutrality: that is the convention used in all tools
<earnestly>	lennart needs to stop doing this
<earnestly>	at least it is configurable
<earnestly>	unlike networkd forwarding
<thrice>	sorry, but i disagree with "arch should be un-user-friendly, for some form of entitlement"
<earnestly>	thrice: i think autospawning is unfriendly
<earnestly>	what now?
<thrice>	you have to appreciate you are the extreme minority
<bneutrality>	okay, thanks guys, mrelendig  -- was there a resource that i could have gone to to find that out?
<thrice>	"i don't want sound to work on its own"
<thrice>	makes no sense to 95% of people
<earnestly>	that's not what i said
<mrelendig>	most people want it to autospawn so imo it is just fine as a default
<earnestly>	and sound will work
<earnestly>	pulse or not
<earnestly>	you're setting up straw men now
<sudokode>	my favorite kind of men
<sudokode>	mmm
<derpadong>	straw men, more like seamen
<sudokode>	derpadong: leave the humor to me
<earnestly>	i find inconsistency to be the most unfriendly thing you can do on a computer as complex as these are today
<thrice>	earnestly: no, gnome depends on pulse running
<earnestly>	when you have to stop and think "where did this process come from", it's unfriendly
<earnestly>	thrice: that's gnome's problem to make sure its running then
<thrice>	again, 95% of people don't inspect their processes in such great detail
<earnestly>	i don't give a fuck what 95% of people think
<holomorph>	let's make up statistics
<derpadong>	isn't everything moving from alsa to pulse now?
<earnestly>	even if it was 99.9%
<scimmia>	thrice, 95% of people will never touch arch, either
<tomty89>	thrice: doesn't gnome start pulse automatically now?
<earnestly>	derpadong: hopefully
<sudokode>	thrice: 95% of people don't check their body temperature either. doesn't mean they don't worry about getting sick
<thrice>	making arch less user-friendly is a terrible idea
<holomorph>	!users
<phrik>	idiots, http://i.imgur.com/ife3dhg.gif
<derpadong>	i know skype uses pulse instead of alsa
<tom^>	mrelendig: boat is ordered, im expecting deliver in ~3 weeks, 30 bhp tohatsu
<tom^>	woop woop
<diegoviola>	sudokode: i tend to check my body temperature
<earnestly>	thrice: you haven't even defined why it's less friendly, at least i defined what it was unfriendly
<tomty89>	tom^: oh secrets
<scimmia>	thrice, giving the user control over their system is anything but a terrible idea
<sudokode>	diegoviola: welcome to the 5%
<earnestly>	you just keep saying that as if you're the keeper of what is friendly or not
<diegoviola>	sudokode: do you check yours?
<mrelendig>	tom^: get a src license and get a vhf too
<thrice>	meh
<diegoviola>	sudokode: i doubt i'm in the 5%
<sudokode>	no, i check other people's though
<sudokode>	when they're asleep
<tom^>	mrelendig: heh nah im broke now :<
<sudokode>	i like to make sure everyone's healthy
<diegoviola>	sudokode: do you work in a hospital?
<mrelendig>	tom^: easy as fuck
<sudokode>	no
<sudokode>	just do it on the side
<sudokode>	for the good of humanity
<diegoviola>	sudokode: why would you do that?
<mrelendig>	tom^: and you can get handheld vhf, even with dsc, dirt cheap
<sudokode>	why not?
<sudokode>	it's good to be paranoid
<diegoviola>	isn't it invasive?
<mrelendig>	tom^: and you can read up on the cert yourself, it is really easy
<sudokode>	no, technically the digestive tract isn't inside of you
<diegoviola>	sudokode: it's good if you are doing for the wellbeing of others though
<bneutrality>	yay updates going guys, this was almost no headache at all
<sudokode>	that's what i keep telling the police
<mrelendig>	tom^: i just read the book a couple of times and passed with just one error, and that was due to the crappy web interface for the exam
<thrice>	earnestly: i'm curious, though.  do you start and stop pulse regularly, or does it run most of the time?
<tom^>	mrelendig: however i sort of want a uh echo sounder first too
<mrelendig>	tom^: that didn't let you correct misclicks >_>
<earnestly>	thrice: i start it pretty much once, with all the other long running user daemons i use
<tom^>	mrelendig: also im not sure the big ferrys would approve of my screaming in the vhf
<earnestly>	if it fails, i want it to stay failed so i might be allowed to see what happened
<earnestly>	although it's only failed once, due to my own fault messing with modules
<thrice>	i guess i just feel that for pretty core-system things (like decently working sound), that should just be automatic, or an expectation of the user that it justworks
<mrelendig>	tom^: they would apreciate it more than not being able to yell at you when you are in the way
<mrelendig>	:p
<scimmia>	thrice, alsa works fine
<mrelendig>	also it might just save your life one day
<earnestly>	thrice: pulse is only core-system for gnome though, alsa works fine without it
<mrelendig>	or someone elses life
<tom^>	mrelendig: haha im expecting ~26 knots
<mrelendig>	sadly the vhf usage is going down :(
<alexoundos>	alright. my problem solved. i had a commented "load-module module-native-protocol-unix" line in /etc/pulse/default.pa for some reason. uncommenting it allowed pavucontrol and mpv to connect to pulseaudio.
<defunctprocess>	mrelendig: i want to has your babbies
<thrice>	scimmia: mm, debatable, but sure.  pulse is the clear future :--)
<earnestly>	thrice: in the case of gnome, yes, you're right that gnome should manage it, just like it manages all the other daemons it uses
<defunctprocess>	mrelendig: <3
<mrelendig>	which is why they are making it easier to take the exam
<earnestly>	the alsa api isn't going away
<tom^>	mrelendig: isnt it going towards some sort of digital devices now?
<tomty89>	alexoundos: wat, you have that commented?
<mrelendig>	in most countries in europe you can take it online now
<scimmia>	thrice, pulse may be the future, but it's really just a layer on top of pulse
<holomorph>	alexoundos: glad you found it o/
<mrelendig>	tom^: no
<earnestly>	pulseaudio needs libasound
<thrice>	ok, i thought your argument was with gnome autostarting pulse
<thrice>	my fault
<scimmia>	er, on top of alsa
<mrelendig>	tom^: well, techically vhf does digital stuff too
<mrelendig>	tom^: dsc = digital self call
<tom^>	i see

<uberlambda>	earnestly: it does not add the spaces before the region

<uberlambda>	what's different?
<tom^>	sudokode: mermaids.
<sudokode>	uberlambda: you described the expected outcome
<earnestly>	you're explaining what it's not doing which you're expecting it to do
<uberlambda>	sudokode: oh, ok
<earnestly>	"don't work" doesn't say anything
<earnestly>	for all we know it could be killing you dog
<earnestly>	your*
<uberlambda>	well, the standard says what it should do
<sudokode>	well that took an interesting turn
<earnestly>	the indent might also be affected by the current indenting scheme used
<mrelendig>	cat master race!
<earnestly>	e.g. haskell-mode has it's own indent system
<penguin>	earnestly: its
<earnestly>	its* ;p

<hexhaxtron>	what is this? fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
<sudokode>	exactly what it says
<sudokode>	whatever you're trying to run git on isn't a git repo
<uberlambda>	*if he
<sudokode>	sure why not
<uberlambda>	sudokode: would i need to create a git repo in /?
<earnestly>	git_work_tree and git_dir is fun
<uberlambda>	or to copy them by hand?
<hexhaxtron>	sudokode, sorry but how i fix it?
<earnestly>	git_dir allows you to basically keep the .git somewhere else
<sudokode>	uberlambda: think the easiest way would be to put them all in one directory, then symlink them to their original places
<sudokode>	and use that one directory as your git repo
<sudokode>	the only problem you run into there is you can't sanitize any of the files before syncing
<uberlambda>	sudokode: hm, i'll try that
<sudokode>	e.g. your weechat's server config
<uberlambda>	#emacs seems pretty much dead btw
<uberlambda>	sudokode: sanitize as in? removing trailing space, etc.?

<e^0_>	which is the lts kernel atm ?
<sudokode>	zakhan: yeah, i don't see that phrase

<sudokode>	take your pick

<arch-tk>	install errorfixer.exe
<arch-tk>	it will fix your error
<zakhan>	arch-tk: are yuo talking to me?
<arch-tk>	zakhan: of course.
<zakhan>	.exe?
<xamindar>	lol
<namarrgon>	it's a virus!
<xamindar>	all .exe files are viri
<zakhan>	i have a problem here and you are making fun
<arch-tk>	zakhan: yes .exe
<qubitnerd>	!g plural of virus
<phrik>	qubitnerd: plural form of words ending in -us - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plural_form_of_words_ending_in_-us>
<namarrgon>	zakhan: 'lscpu'
<earnestly>	is viruses
<earnestly>	not viri
<earnestly>	learn2latin
<xamindar>	viruseseseses
<eleventh>	earnestly is learn2latin in the aur?
<tomty89>	hmm wonder when will 30-dbus.sh be necessary
<earnestly>	eleventh: maybe
<homerj>	oh what is this nonsense now....kde 5.3, my battery applet is going bonkers
<eleventh>	figured it would packaged with dos2unix
<sudokode>	earnestly: sometimes it's tough when the language doesn't always agree with itself
<_mel_>	hi. i#m using cinnamon. gedit 3.16 looks a lot like gnome. can i somehow change it to make gedit look more "classic"?
<earnestly>	sudokode: virus is already plural though, in latin
<sudokode>	this isn't latin
<xamindar>	learn to btrfs then you can just roll back to a working snapshot ;)
<earnestly>	sudokode: basically, it's simple, don't invent latin
<namarrgon>	_mel_: apart from the theme, not really
<ingar>	homerj: how is 5 compared to 4? i still need to upgrade, but i'm scared becayse i haven't forgotten 4.0
<homerj>	i like it
<earnestly>	octopi is also wrongish
<sudokode>	radius -> radii, cactus -> cacti, virus -> viruses, octopus -> actually, it's octopuses most of the time but some do say octopi
<sudokode>	exactly, it's wrongish
<earnestly>	both are acceptable
<qubitnerd>	earnestly: the english plural of virus is viruses.[1] in most speaking communities, this is non-controversial and speakers would not attempt to use the non-standard plural in -i. however, in computer enthusiast circles in the late 20th century and early 21st, the non-standard viri form (sometimes even virii) was well-attested, generally in the context of computer viruses
<earnestly>	just not octopideas
<sudokode>	irregardless
<earnestly>	is wrong ;p
<sudokode>	no it's not
<xamindar>	but viri sounds better so i use it
<_mel_>	namarrgon: it keeps having the close button on the right side even if any other windos has it on the left (my preferred)
<sudokode>	it's also a word now in colloquial use
<sudokode>	that's how words work :d
<xamindar>	i don't care what's right or wrong
<earnestly>	xamindar: you're just a neolatin hipster
<wasamasa>	lol
<xamindar>	oh no you didn't!
<xamindar>	lol
<sudokode>	literally semantics right now
<sudokode>	it's great
<homerj>	to quote an english major i used to date, using things like "virii" or "octopi" isn't a rule, it's more of a guide
<wasamasa>	homerj: octopi is crappy software
<sudokode>	lets talk about the oxford comma next
<wasamasa>	homerj: and that's a rule!
<homerj>	there's not rule that says you have to put an "i" plural
<earnestly>	it's needed
<xamindar>	more like guidelines
<xamindar>	arrr!
<homerj>	it's latin, not english
<_mel_>	is there any cinnamon editor equal to gedit?
<earnestly>	homerj: virii is not latin
<homerj>	or whatever
<earnestly>	homerj: virus is latin and already a plural
<sudokode>	virii wouldn't even be the proper pluralization
<qubitnerd>	whats the singular ?
<sudokode>	that's a mistake people make because they only have one other -us word in their vocab
<earnestly>	_mel_: yes, gedit
<sudokode>	another word i take issue with is data
<earnestly>	_mel_: or does cinnamon use some wacky toolkit now?
<sudokode>	data is plural, but it sounds so stupid when you use it like a plural word
<zakhan>	namarrgon: http://hastebin.com/niqubocune.coffee
<phrik>	title: hastebin (at hastebin.com)
<xamindar>	cinnamon is gtk so i would assume gedit would be fine
<homerj>	it's like of like pierogi
<_mel_>	earnestly: gedit looks like gnome3 theme
<homerj>	it's already plural
<homerj>	but people still say pierogis
<earnestly>	_mel_: adwaita is a gtk3 theme
<homerj>	pierog is the singular in polish
<arch-tk>	homerj: pierogis?
<xamindar>	i can't use gtk too much on this laptop, it always ends in screen corruption. qt all work fine
<arch-tk>	homerj: not in poland they don't
<earnestly>	homerj: sheep :p
<namarrgon>	zakhan: pacman -q intel-ucode
<arch-tk>	homerj: pierogis wtf really?
<sudokode>	heh, my parents call them pierogis
<sudokode>	they love those things
<homerj>	arch-tk, i love some pierogis
<sudokode>	i have never had one
<arch-tk>	it's pronounced pie
<arch-tk>	ro
<arch-tk>	gi
<_mel_>	can i change the gnome3 window decoration to put the close button on the left side?
<arch-tk>	and it's plural
<homerj>	arch-tk, yes
<homerj>	people in the us will use an s
<zakhan>	namarrgon: paackage not found
<namarrgon>	!give zakhan tsx
<phrik>	zakhan: intel's tsx instruction causes various thread segfaults on haswell and newer cpus, get the microcode update that disables it. https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/microcode
<arch-tk>	homerj: people in the us are noobs
<earnestly>	_mel_: i believe so, or one was able to
<earnestly>	not sure now actually
<xamindar>	_mel_: maybe try geany?
<arch-tk>	homerj: they need to l2p
<arch-tk>	homerj: learn to pierogi
<sudokode>	or learn2polish
<earnestly>	eat polish
<arch-tk>	hey, i'll pronounce it for you
<homerj>	arch-tk, that's what i mean, borrowed works and what to do with them, the original language rules are more of a guide, kind of like the pirate's code
<earnestly>	polish my polish shoes
<sudokode>	how many polish guys does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
<homerj>	s/works/words
<_mel_>	xamindar: geany is a ide right?
<sudokode>	depends on how you define ide
<xamindar>	yeah a simple one
<sudokode>	well then vim is an ide
<xamindar>	works really well as a text edotor though
<_mel_>	more than just an editor :)
<sudokode>	hey vim too
<tomty89>	is emacs an ide?
<xamindar>	editor*
<sudokode>	tomty89: seems so
<eleventh>	emacs == os
<xamindar>	lol
<tomty89>	emacs == tiling wm
<_mel_>	emacs? you mean the operating system? :-)
<qubitnerd>	why do people use == ?
<tomty89>	we should make emacs a wayland compositor
<e^0_>	tomty89: hey :) how you doin..
<tomty89>	hi o/
<zakhan>	namarrgon: installed intel-ucode
<xamindar>	because only one "=" would be assigning to that variable
<scimmia>	qubitnerd, because that's the comparison operator
<tomty89>	xamindar: it depends
<qubitnerd>	so when you use == there should be a question mark at the end of the line
<qubitnerd>	emacs == os ? and someone replies true
<xamindar>	lol
<tomty89>	should we introduce brackets and parenthesis
<tomty89>	*ses
<xamindar>	we shouls all only post in code hahaha
<charlesatum>	in which language?
<eleventh>	fortran
<ingar>	time to learn brainfuck then
<scimmia>	take your pick. more fun that way
<scimmia>	one person posting in python, one posting in asm
<scimmia>	could get interesting

<tomty89>	    hi

<wasamasa>	arch-tk: "what is the meaning of life?" - "pierogi" (resignated tone)
<wasamasa>	earnestly: i did glance over it
<arch-tk>	wasamasa: it's the first track of the album "pierogi"
<earnestly>	wasamasa: i packaged it, was pretty easy.  either way, their research actually seems credible
<_mel_>	anyone ever tried medit as replacement for gedit?
<arch-tk>	wasamasa: check the file tags

<prinsen>	i experience a strange behaviour with netctl and multiple interfaces. i have created naming rules as stated in the wiki, and the devices get correct names. but one of the netctl profiles always fails saying that net-subsystem timed out until i reenable the profile

<zakhan>	namarrgon: i have no idea
<colbyf>	question, when building your arch distro up, do most people end up with everything on it anyways?

<godginrai>	oh wait
<qubitnerd>	holomorph you're grammar is good
<godginrai>	just saw that holomorph said the same thing
<colbyf>	i get it, it is a pointless question, cause you built it how you want, and if you want "everything" you do it.
<godginrai>	colbyf: i would say that most people on arch tend to have a lot of different software than is default on ubuntu/mint

<murkx>	i'll go with networkmanager then, thx :)
<grawity>	zsandu: for pacman, or for your regular keyring?

<zsandu>	gpg: keyserver receive failed: no keyserver available
<arch-tk>	zsandu: man gpg
<zsandu>	i tried that a while ago
<bitschift>	oops sorry about that
<zsandu>	how hell does one use that --keyserver option i cannot understand.
<grapeape>	how hell, indeed!
<grapeape>	:)
<grawity>	--keyserver *might* be broken in current gnupg
<grawity>	but generally it's "--keyserver pgp.mit.edu"
<zsandu>	grawity, i always am given that "go ahead and type your message box"
<godginrai>	charlesatum: you know, now that i look more into that package... i'm tempted to install it <.<
<zsandu>	i'm just so confused. what would you guys reccomend as a learning curve for linux?
<tomty89>	exponential
<grawity>	zsandu: are you trying both options at once, or separately?
<teraflop>	tomty89: xd
<zsandu>	grawity, this time i tried separately.
<grawity>	use them both at once then
<arch-tk>	zsandu: the learning curve for linux is the same as the learning curve for reading a man page
<tomty89>	youtube-dl get dash streams by default now <3
<grawity>	--recv-key is the action; --keyserver adjusts its parameters
<zsandu>	grawity, looks like gpg doesn't not want more than one option: https://bpaste.net/show/1036ce913788

<pinkiesout>	i would love some help debugging an intermittent internet connection problem. can't seem to find errors anywhere. using netctl-auto to manage wifi. connects (usually) without problem, and 'iw <dev> link' shows constant connection, yet occasionally internet drops (no ping) despite persistant connection to router. very hard to debug
<pinkiesout>	would love advice on where to look for problems...
<grawity>	zsandu: hrmm, i guess it is being picky about their order?
<godginrai>	!give pinkiesout netctl
<phrik>	pinkiesout: users having issues with netctl are advised to try alternatives such as systemd-networkd, networkmanager, or connman.
<godginrai>	so many netctl problems today o.o
<pinkiesout>	phrik: advised by who? is this a way to deal with annoying newbie problems, or an indication that netctl is amassing bugs?
<grawity>	to some point, might be both

<holomorph>	pinkiesout: in general, by this channel. netctl is a pretty poopy wrapper around tools that work just fine by themselves
<grawity>	for most newbies, it's just better to use a tool that's tested by several different distros and has most of the bugs ironed out, than a tool that's only used by arch and is...kludgy.
<grawity>	prefer to waste time on things that matter.
<holomorph>	it often gives useless errors if any at all, does stupid things, etc
<zsandu>	grawity, is gpg ironed out too?
<prinsen>	does a kernel upgrade affect netctl? going from 3.19 to 4.0.1
<grawity>	zsandu: not really
<grawity>	zsandu: if anything, 2.1 broke several things
<grawity>	prinsen: generally it shouldn't
<thrice>	prinsen: in that the underlying drivers may have changed, kind of.  but mostly not
<orbifx>	is anyone using incrond here ?
<holomorph>	!give orbifx ask
<phrik>	orbifx: don't ask to ask, if anyone is here or alive, or uses something. just ask, and we'll get moving along. thanks.
<godginrai>	prinsen: i'm starting to think so, given the number of people complaining about netctl today
<zsandu>	grawity, oh, so it wasn't this bad before. i mean i was getting a feeling it might be me that is really not able to make it work...
<grawity>	well, the ui was always bad
<orbifx>	can stderr of a script executing by incron be piped into a file?
<grawity>	it's widely mocked for that
<grawity>	it's just --keyserver specifically that was broken for a while, and is still somewhat worse than before
<orbifx>	trying `script 2> errfile`, but doesn't seem to work.
<godginrai>	!give orbifx xyproblem
<phrik>	orbifx: tell us what you're really trying to do. http://mywiki.wooledge.org/xyproblem

<polyzen>	!wtf xelatex
<phrik>	polyzen: extra/texlive-bin
<slunatecqo>	hi - i have problems with font in urxvt. when i copy a character from gucharmap and paste it in urxvt, i can see just rectangle. i am using the same font in urxvt. when i use another terminal emulator, (and the same font), everything works...
<orbifx>	i want to get the stderr of a script into a file.
<orbifx>	nothing is written into the file, although i know there should be messages.
<holomorph>	pinkiesout: go for it
<ruan>	i've used systemd-networkd for a wired connection and it's instant compared to netctl which takes 2 seconds for some reason
<ruan>	(with ssd)
<zsandu>	what exactly does a "skeleton config file" stand for? as an example?
<pinkiesout>	ruan: netctl is very slow to respond for me as well. but the random dropping of connection is a deal breaker
<grawity>	zsandu: a configuration file that has the bare minimum of options
<holomorph>	or a file that is copied by useradd(8)
<zsandu>	grawity, ok, so much less than an example would have.
<grawity>	eh, it's a rather vague term, but yeah, you could say that
<zsandu>	so in the comments on the aur page of the package that i'm interested in, someone in the comments is suggesting to set up a personal keyring, since my install of archlinux is fresh, i guess i need to do that too. does one have to give gpg a specific command or simply try and import existing keys?
<polyzen>	lol i have to install mesa and wayland in order to install texlive-bin...
<earnestly>	zsandu: a skeleton doesn't have any meat to it
<earnestly>	zsandu: and it's less of an example and more of a "where to start"
<earnestly>	i.e. "these are good defaults, add your own stuff to it", which is why it's called a skeleton
<zsandu>	earnestly, ok, i will get that skeleton conf and add in the suggested lines.
<grawity>	zsandu: honestly? `gpg --import /usr/share/pacman/keyrings/archlinux.gpg` will be fine
<grawity>	or adding "keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve" to ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
<zsandu>	thanks a lot. yes, i did do the second one.
<godginrai>	polyzen: a lot of things rely on wayland now, it seems
<grawity>	if it still doesn't work, add "keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu"
<zsandu>	grawity, this is strange. after using your import command and also settings up that skeleton file and the "keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve" option in it, it works fine. i can import keys with: keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve
<zsandu>	maybe i did a mistake earlier of just generating a config file for .gnupg with just "keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve" in it.
<zsandu>	i mean i did this earlier before speaking to you.
<zsandu>	well it looks like now the aur package is working fine. thank you. can i ask about a quick lecture about the pacman keyring and the personal keyring? so, the keyring used in pacman is used to check the packages that are being downloaded?
<firedingo|mobile>	so i have a small issue. i tried starting plasma via xinitrc and i got these very confusing errors. xterm: command not found and twm: command not found. can someone help me please?
<ph0x>	pacman install xterm twm
<grawity>	firedingo|mobile: looks like it isn't actually using your xinitrc, but the system's default xinitrc
<firedingo|mobile>	ah ok.

<ph0x>	i didnt read but the last line
<grawity>	that was the only line anyway

<devgrohl>	firedingo: opengl libs probably
<jonimus>	or you trying to configure x server instead of letting it do its thing automaticaly
<firedingo|mobile>	except i have no idea what.
<charlesatum>	anyone using chromium could help me with a simple test?
<firedingo|mobile>	jonimus: it wasn't doing anything so i tried starting it via xinitrc and after that i got that error.
<clarjon1>	charlesatum: yo.
<bitschift>	is avr-gcc incompatible with atmega?
<charlesatum>	ok, clarjon1, open this webpage: http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/eevee_(pok%c3%a9mon)
<charlesatum>	wait some minutes for it to load
<charlesatum>	then press shift + esc
<charlesatum>	tell how much memory this tab uses and how much physical ram and swap you have.
<grawity>	wait *minutes* for it to load?
<qubitnerd>	bitschift: no
<charlesatum>	ok, 1 minute
<grawity>	it loads in 3 seconds...
<grawity>	anyway, 56,384 kb and slowly falling
<charlesatum>	should be enough for the memory to leak
<arch-tk>	charlesatum: it loads in about 0.4 seconds
<tylerdurden01>	pokemon wikipedia? /facepalm
<charlesatum>	ok, wait a few minutes *after* it loads, so memory can leak
<qubitnerd>	bitschift: most of the atmega microcontrollers are supported by avr-gcc
<grawity>	keeps jumping up by several hundred kb, but slowly falling again
<grawity>	tylerdurden01: what's the problem
<grawity>	tylerdurden01: it's not any worse than having a linux wiki
<clarjon1>	175... 176000k... 177....
<charlesatum>	here the tab uses 617 mb
<clarjon1>	178...
<qubitnerd>	tylerdurden01: pokemon wiki
<charlesatum>	6 gb physical ram + 16 gib swap
<grawity>	okay, maybe it's the µblock, but the tab still hasn't reached 57,000 k
<clarjon1>	8gb physical, 3.8gb swap here.
<clarjon1>	no adblockers on this chromium install.
<clarjon1>	just hit 182,000k
<earnestly>	sounds like bad ads then
<grawity>	yep, definitely µblock, after disabling it's 287,300 kb in a few moments
<earnestly>	grawity: (seen pony lang?)
<clarjon1>	it dropped down a bit, it hink it may have peaked...
<charlesatum>	704 mb now
<earnestly>	all the more reason to use ublock
<grawity>	conveniently, chromium has js heap profiling in the devtools panel
<clarjon1>	woah.
<clarjon1>	in the stats for nerds section, it recognized i'm running firefox, and is showing chromium's memory usage in comparison.
<clarjon1>	neat
<godginrai>	tylerdurden01: why not?  it makes sense for there to be wiki's for things that contain a lot of information.  especially if you want to crowdsource the information.
<grawity>	clarjon1: that was in fact a selling point in the first days of chromium
<clarjon1>	i have way more tabs open in firefox
<clarjon1>	and chromium is using more ram
<saivert>	µblock is hard to configure though. not very userfriendly with that weird ui for setting blocks
<bitschift>	qubitnerd: usbserial doesn't seem to work for some reason
<saivert>	basically colored blocks of something.
<qubitnerd>	that isnt avr-gcc's fault then
<soulescaper>	chromium takes a very long time to load on my system , prob viruses
<godginrai>	soulescaper: stop going to shady websites
<grawity>	charlesatum: yeah, it seems to be leaked by ads.pubmatic.com
<soulescaper>	:)
<soulescaper>	it s very bad when your nickname is a reference to that kind of site
<bitschift>	i figured as much, my udev rules seem alright and everything
<bitschift>	this works pergfectly under ubuntu
<bitschift>	which baffles me
<charlesatum>	godginrai: did you try thefuck?
<godginrai>	charlesatum: haven't tried it.  but i'm getting more and more tempted to install it
<qubitnerd>	bitschift: is it using a bootloader ?
<bitschift>	qubitnerd: yeah, it is
<bitschift>	qubitnerd: teensy 2.0
<_mel_>	is ther any bluez applet for cinnamon?
<qubitnerd>	bitschift: dmesg and lsusb ?
<bitschift>	qubitnerd: that's what i use
<bitschift>	qubitnerd: it mounts sometimes as /dev/ttyacm0 or usb0, and sometimes not at all
<bitschift>	qubitnerd: i'm unable to use teensyloadercli to program the device
<teraflop>	thefuck is quite useful for my typo desease

<silentz0r>	soulescaper: yeah
<godginrai>	when mispelled
<charlesatum>	er.. should "no fuck given" be appearing when i open a new terminal or source .bashrc?
<soulescaper>	lol

<silentz0r>	soulescaper: btw it's happening to two of my pcs (both laptops, neither has laptop mode tools anymore)
<charlesatum>	let's see, should i trust the upstream or the mantiner?
<bfrizzle>	hey, i'm seeing a conflict between directives in /etc/modprobe.d and /usr/lib/modprobe.d - installing nvidia places a blacklist for nouveau in /usr/lib/modprobe.d, but the blacklist isn't effective. i had to put the blacklist into a config file in /etc/modprobe.d/something.conf - did i miss something along the way that deprecated /etc/modprobe.d?
<charlesatum>	s/mantiner/mantainer/
<hexhaxtron>	somehow my firefox and pidgin stopped having access to the internet... what should i do?
<godginrai>	charlesatum: with regards to what?
<orbifx>	if anyone ever looks into this log looking for an answer to the question i had: incron doesn't support redirects and other shell interpretations. first word is the command and the rest are arguments to it.
<charlesatum>	godginrai: which alias command to use. the on on the .install or the one in the github page?
<teraflop>	charlesatum: fix your alias
<soulescaper>	silentzor: i don't know much about hibernating, i just know that i solved it by creating a swap partition and that the swap must be big enough according too your ram
<charlesatum>	ok, so i should not trust the mantiner not putting aposthrophes in the alias command.
<clarjon1>	hexhaxtron: check if there's a proxy configured?
<hexhaxtron>	what the heck?.... suddenly firefox and pidgin stopped having access to the internet... but i can use chromium and skype...
<hexhaxtron>	clarjon1, yes, i got tor.
<godginrai>	charlesatum: it's not the apostrophes that matter.  it's whether that `history -r` matters, as far as i'm concerned
<clarjon1>	hexhaxtron: and you're certain that they're configured correctly to use said proxy?
<hexhaxtron>	i got connection again.
<hexhaxtron>	thanks!
<godginrai>	i tend to err with the upstream unless the maintainer has a believable reason for what they are doing
<earnestly>	godginrai: outside of bug, maintainers have no business changing upstream
<earnestly>	bugs*
<charlesatum>	damn, i will have to use all my free time to learn c++, =/
<godginrai>	earnestly: agreed
<earnestly>	charlesatum: stick to modern c++ and you'll be good
<dacoit>	lucky you
<godginrai>	earnestly: in this case, however, the maintainer wasn't changing upstream.  he was adding an alias that was only "suggested" in the upstream readme
<charlesatum>	unfortunately i just have a 1995 book and sometimes no good internet access on weekends.
<atweiden>	i have a broken install. i think because i forgot to upgrade systemd-sysvcompat-git when i last upgraded systemd-git
<hannibal_smith>	charlesatum, a good way to not learn c++!
<earnestly>	godginrai: that's borderline, but i'd still say no
<earnestly>	charlesatum: yeah, you'll want to not use that book
<atweiden>	i have recovered the machine, and am just wondering how to mount /proc in a arch-chroot
<dacoit>	theres no shortage of free c++ books you can download
<atweiden>	am planning to run arch-chroot /mnt/rescue to fix it
<earnestly>	charlesatum: get stroustroup's book
<earnestly>	the rest suck
<earnestly>	especially ones by meyers
<gog>	the arch-chroot script should automatically do that
<holomorph>	wget cppreference.com for reference http://en.cppreference.com/w/cppreference:archives :p

<earnestly>	charlesatum: way too old
<gog>	mkdir /mnt/rescue/proc
<godginrai>	charlesatum: have you learned c yet?
<earnestly>	charlesatum: most books barely even touch on c++11 let alone c++03
<dacoit>	20 freakin years
<earnestly>	and c++11 is a very different language and approach
<earnestly>	it starts to drop the oo bullshit
<atweiden>	gog: mkdir /mnt/rescue/proc  ;;; failed to setyup chroot /mnt/rescue
<dacoit>	might as well use a fortran77 book
<gog>	wait is the root of the system you're trying to rescue mounted?
<atweiden>	gog: i mounted btrfs subvols, so maybe?
<gog>	what's in ls /mnt/rescue ?
<atweiden>	boot home opt proc srv tmp usr var
<gog>	uh okay
<gog>	that looks right
<charlesatum>	i will think about that tomorrow, but i will check for a different book.
<gog>	is proc already mounted?
<atweiden>	i didn't do anything special with /mnt/rescue/proc besides mkdir
<gog>	strange
<gog>	where is sys
<atweiden>	not there; it isn't created as a btrfs subvol
<hannibal_smith>	charlesatum, just a personal opion from someone who has only recently learned c++, do what earnestly said, otherwise you will only lose time
<atweiden>	hmm, might've mounted it wrong
<gog>	did the filesystem package get installed?
<hannibal_smith>	c++ is not a language that you can learn from bad books, and changed a lot recently
<gog>	also proc should not be a subvol
<gog>	nor sys
<gog>	they're psuedo-filesystems for exposing kernel data structures to user space
<atweiden>	gog: am running a livecd; the system being rescued would have proc and sys functioning on it
<atweiden>	but, maybe didn't get mounted
<gog>	okay
<atweiden>	can i do anything with a pacman config here?
<gog>	no
<gog>	because etc is missing, too
<gog>	it's like the filesystem package was never installed
<atweiden>	would pacstrap work?
<gog>	probably
<gog>	that's what it's for
<atweiden>	without data loss would be nice
<gog>	what data are you worried about?
<atweiden>	pacstrapit is safe?
<gog>	shouldn't touch /home
<gog>	if the directory already exists it should just warn about it
<atweiden>	well in that case it's fine i guess
<mijenix>	hi
<mijenix>	my internal nic gets the right ip/default gw but the interface is not up
<mijenix>	what can be the problem
<damarusama>	pcmanfm ftp/ssh connection give me a operation not supported
<damarusama>	not sure what i am missing for pcmanfm to support these type of connections
<atweiden>	gogs: pacstrapit /mnt/rescue ... ==> /mnt/rescue is not a mountmount
<atweiden>	gog*
<atweiden>	should i pacstrap a fresh system and transplant the files manually?
<soulescaper>	atjeiden: did you make that folder first?
<atweiden>	yes i have mounted btrfs subvols in /mnt/rescue already
<demize>	what is pacstrapit from?
<atweiden>	pacstrap*
<atweiden>	typo
<demize>	anyway, pacstrap has a -d flag
<atweiden>	demize: running with -d flag   error: failed to initialize alpm library (could not find or read directory: /mnt/rescue/var/lib/pacman/)
<atweiden>	that directory exists tho
<ahop>	do you have ideas about mistakes i could have done while installing "autofs" for automounting usb devices?
<ahop>	i struggle with this since days... unsucessfully
<mijenix>	seems ipv6 related
<ahop>	?
<mijenix>	systemd-networkd[223]: enp3s0          : cannot configure ipv6 forwarding for interface: no such file or directory
<mijenix>	systemd-networkd[223]: enp3s0          : enp3s0          : could not bring up interface: address family not supported by protocol
<mijenix>	systemd-networkd[223]: enp3s0          : enp3s0          : could not set route: network is unreachable
<ahop>	i followed exactly: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/autofs
<phrik>	title: autofs - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<thelemonman>	maybe you could try another tool
<ahop>	thelemonman which one?
<thelemonman>	ahop, i heard ldm is great
<reisio>	display managers?
<gehidore>	t
<silentz0r>	so, laptop taking 5 minutes to wake up from suspend. any ideas?
<gehidore>	wtf mouse focus
<gehidore>	sounds more like it's suspend to disk'd rather than ram
<reisio>	silentz0r: what power manager?
<mijenix>	so if i disable ipv6 i cannot use static ips anymore?
<mijenix>	any ideas?
<silentz0r>	reisio: acpi i'd say, but dunno if plasma desktop has it's own
<ahop>	thelemonman:  pacman -s ldm
<ahop>	error: target not found: ldm
<godginrai>	charlesatum: so, did you install thefuck?
<sash_>	hi, i gotta short question. i run gnome3 on arch using gdm. yesterday, i found out that i got the login screen on 2 ttys. today, i had a deeper look and found /usr/lib/xorg-server/xorg vt1 -displayfd 3 -auth /run/user/120/gdm/xauthority -nolisten tcp -background none -noreset -keeptty -verbose 3 on tty1 (user 120 is gnome display manager) and the same with user 1000 on tty2 (i am user 1000). any ideas? i already set waylandenable=false in ...
<sash_>	... /etc/gdm/custom.conf to get rid of the wayland session that i don't need, but it has just been replaced i guess
<thelemonman>	ahop, it's available on the aur
<prinsen>	i recently changed from debian. i use kvm with pci-assign (the old method) and add my graphics card to pci-sub.ids. in debian i could assign the device to a qemu host, but now it says that the pci-stub driver is occupying it, which is wierd as it is what i want
<ahop>	thelemonman  how to do it with pacman?
<godginrai>	ahop: download the tarball from the aur, untar, cd to directory with pkgbuild, makepkg -s, pacman -u <generated_package.tar.gz>
<ahop>	thelemonman: is it suited to mount/unmount/remount  usb sticks
<ahop>	i see : ldm doesn't offer any blacklisting by itself but it honors the options found in the fstab so it will ignore any device with flag noauto.
<ahop>	a usb stick will always be as "noauto" in fstab, right?
<ahop>	so it will be ignored by ldm?
<thelemonman>	hrm, i'm don't quite understand the question but yes, marking it as noauto makes ldm ignore it
<ahop>	thelemonman: will it work for usb sticks which are not plugged in on boot time?
<ahop>	ie:  no usb stick on boot,   2 minutes later, i plug a usb stick
<thelemonman>	well, that's the main use case
<charlesatum>	damn, so should i simply return the book i borrowed from my friend?
<s00pcan>	not very active in here today eh?
<earnestly>	charlesatum: yes
<charlesatum>	anyway, what do you all recommend for learning c? i was trying the learn c the hard way last time.
<charlesatum>	*"learn c the hard way"
<ahop>	thelemonman: do you have a package ready-to-use?
<ahop>	i don't know how to compile/install this package
<earnestly>	charlesatum: eh, c is a bit different
<godginrai>	charlesatum: the best resource out there is this book: http://www.amazon.com/the-programming-language-brian-kernighan/dp/0131103628
<earnestly>	godginrai: not really anymore
<diegoviola>	will zram really help with performance on a old computer with low ram?
<diegoviola>	instead of swapping to disk
<diegoviola>	hdd, not ssd
<earnestly>	charlesatum: honestly, get some basic familiarty with it by playing with it, use gdb to analyse what's going on, then read expert programming: deep c secrets and then just read the standard/gcc/clang manuals ;/
<charlesatum>	ok, thanks
<earnestly>	charlesatum: and read modern codebases like openbsd, linux, sel4, systemd, etc.
<godginrai>	earnestly: i find it to be better than anything else i've seen.  still haven't looked into that deep c book yet, tho'.
<hannibal_smith>	charlesatum, http://fabiensanglard.net/c/
<earnestly>	charlesatum: or thestinger's allocator code and such
<phrik>	title: to become a good c programmer (at fabiensanglard.net)
<koz_>	charlesatum: i recommend "21st century c" as a *second* book on c.
<earnestly>	godginrai: ansi c is too old, full of bad practice
<koz_>	also, you may find some of the stuff here useful: https://notabug.org/koz.ross/awesome-c
<phrik>	title: awesome-c - notabug.org: free code hosting (at notabug.org)
<earnestly>	it's not bad, if you know not to fall into those traps
<koz_>	look at the learning section.
<earnestly>	erm, no
<earnestly>	don't follow this websites advice
<earnestly>	it also links to pirated content
<earnestly>	and talks about struct packing, fuck this
<earnestly>	even if it is esr
<earnestly>	!yt standard programming paradigms
<phrik>	earnestly: lecture 1 | programming paradigms (stanford) - youtube: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps8joj7dia0>
<godginrai>	earnestly: what in particular is wrong w/ struct packing?
<thelemonman>	what's wrong with learning how structures are represented ?
<earnestly>	godginrai: you don't know alignment better than the compiler
<earnestly>	thelemonman: that's what programming paradigms does
<earnestly>	in a proper way
<godginrai>	earnestly: good point
<ahop>	thelemonman: is there a way to install ldm without having to compile it myself?
<earnestly>	godginrai: intel's major contribution was to design cpus that don't explode on misaligned data, just performance hits instead
<charlesatum>	so, could i also have your opinions on the flos design from that old 2012 or 2013 article?
<earnestly>	alignment used to matter quite a lot :p
<ahop>	i have a minimalistic computer, with few cpu + drive space, without gcc
<ahop>	would there be a ready to use package of ldm somewhere?
<demize>	earnestly: struct packing has it's place. it's something that doesn't matter most of the times but there are cases it does matter, like esr's page talks about.
<thelemonman>	meh, it's better to explode than to become slow as fuck heh
<earnestly>	charlesatum: keep in mind that expert programming aka "the fish" is old, but it's written by someone on the standard with a perspective on the standard.  lots of real world examples as well and quite short
<thelemonman>	ahop, sure, what arch do you need it for ?
<cloudef>	thelemonman: misaligned data has use when doing network code :p
<earnestly>	demize: it's almost never a good idea.  you're much better off just being smart about how you arrange the struct fields
<absolute0>	gnome-terminal in awesome wm has a transparent border while the other windows do not
<absolute0>	how do i fix this?
<earnestly>	demize: you'll get better performance too
<demize>	earnestly: i.e. know about struct packing.
<ahop>	thelemonman: arm, but i asked here because you're the maintainer of this package
<godginrai>	thelemonman: exploding is never better
<absolute0>	i have size_hints_honor = false,
<ahop>	i know there's another channel for arm
<earnestly>	demize: programming paradigms standard lectures discuss it better than esr
<thelemonman>	cloudef, most of the time the buffers you use are always padded and rounded
<demize>	*shrug*
<earnestly>	stanford*
<thelemonman>	ahop, gah i don't have a suitable cross compiler at the moment, you should try asking in #archlinuxarm
<ahop>	thelemonman: i did but no answer
<earnestly>	demize: i've looked into a lot of this stuff trying to find good material and there's so much trash out there it's not even funny
<earnestly>	demize: and almost all material on c assumes you know it already
<thelemonman>	godginrai, raise an exception and let the kernel handle the unaligned access :d
<ahop>	i'm really fighting with udev+autofs+usbmount(not available anywhere on arch!)  since days...
<earnestly>	demize: and the ones which don't are far too ancient
<godginrai>	thelemonman: it's #archlinux-arm
<demize>	i found esr's page rather good last time i read it, but i could see why newer people would get confused by it
<earnestly>	demize: also pony is... an interesting language.  the n-body code runs in 9.18s
<earnestly>	demize: the best c++ runs in 9.08s
<demize>	pony?
<thelemonman>	ahop, #archlinux-arm as godginrai pointed out
<earnestly>	demize: i thought it was a joke at first... but they actually have mechanical proofs for their type system in system f ;s
<ahop>	thelemonman i already asked there. eally i'm fighting with automount since days
<earnestly>	demize: http://ponylang.org/
<phrik>	title: pony - high performance actor programming (at ponylang.org)
<ahop>	it drives me really crazy :)
<ahop>	such a simple thing
<codebam>	if i have 1 core, should i put my makeflags to -j 2 (1 more than the number of cores) or just leave it default?
<thelemonman>	the enforced alignment also gives you a marginal improvement security-wise
<earnestly>	demize: i packaged it as pony-git, you have to use ponyc -p /usr/lib/pony
<godginrai>	earnestly: it probably was a joke, but they probably said: "well, if we're gonna do it... let's make it impressive"
<earnestly>	godginrai: but it, has like papers
<earnestly>	proper ones
<ahop>	thelemonman: i finally installed gcc, etc. and succesfully have done "make"
<earnestly>	and it's curiously quick
<ahop>	what to do to install ldm now?
<thelemonman>	ahop, the package is really tiny, i think the rpi or whatever should handle it well
<ahop>	yeah, i just built it now
<demize>	earnestly: huh...
<thelemonman>	ahop, you're advised to use makepkg and the aur package to avoid /usr pollution
<earnestly>	demize: imagine if rust was written using pascal's syntax with a secret love of hoare
<ahop>	thelemonman: i never did any package, so i might be lost with this
<ahop>	isn't there an easy solution to run ldm quickly
<ahop>	now that's it built?
<earnestly>	demize: the language sort of appeared out of nowhere
<earnestly>	https://github.com/causalityltd/ponyc
<phrik>	title: causalityltd/ponyc · github (at github.com)
<thelemonman>	ahop, well you can easily run it as ./ldm
<charlesatum>	so, should we start migrating our production critical software to pony?
<thelemonman>	ahop, make sure to read the manpages and the included systemd script
<hyo0301>	hell
<hyo0301>	o
<charlesatum>	s/?/?</s>/
<demize>	earnestly: (also, what is it with this trend of having programming languages be un-googlable?)
<charlesatum>	sure it's not like as if common verbs and nouns are turned into names of programing languages
<jelle>	one pony at a time
<hyo0301>	can i get support here on how to install arch? or do i have to go elsewhere
<thelemonman>	meh, there's no trace of examples
<appledash>	7there is a tutorial, hyo0301
<appledash>	it's pretty good
<codebam>	xd my processor costs $4 on amazon http://www.amazon.com/intel-pentium-2-8ghz-800mhz-socket/dp/b001949fwk/
<cyphix>	hi. i'm trying to install the graphical interface. i can launch startx from root, but with my standard user, the result of the command is "xf860openconle: cannot open virtual console 1 (permission denied). what am i doing wrong?
<earnestly>	demize: lol, ikr
<earnestly>	demize: but
<earnestly>	demize: r c j k m
<hyo0301>	appledash: i know, but i'm having trouble even booting arch, that's the problem
<earnestly>	demize: go...
<namarrgon>	hyo0301: ask away
<appledash>	what sort of issues?
<demize>	true.
<ahop>	thelemonman: i got a "/dev/sdb1 (fs_usage : vfat fs_type : filesystem)
<ahop>	segmentation fault (core dumped)"
<earnestly>	demize: just append 'lang' and it usually works
<ahop>	known issue?
<hyo0301>	i have mounted archlinux.2015.01.05-dual.iso to g: and booted from that cd drive, still not getting arch up
<demize>	c is mostly googlable though, but you get a lot of c++ results too
<appledash>	what do you get?
<earnestly>	demize: google lets you actually do -c++ and it just works
<hyo0301>	nothing, it just skips it and goes directly to windows loadscreen
<earnestly>	demize: you'd think the ++ would be stripped but i think they made an exception for it
<appledash>	are you sure your boot order is right?
<hannibal_smith>	earnestly, ms published a paper that seems similar to what pony proposes for their "capabilities" http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/170528/msr-tr-2012-79.pdf
<earnestly>	hannibal_smith: their capabilities are just type qualifiers
<hyo0301>	i'm wondering if it's even right to use daemontools to install archlinux
<earnestly>	nothing like os/kernel capabilities
<hyo0301>	appledash:  yes it is
<charlesatum>	plot twist: pony was created by microsoft
<earnestly>	hannibal_smith: but yeah, this paper is very similar
<appledash>	...no, it is not right to use daemon tools to install arch linux. daemon tools will mount the image inside of windows.
<demize>	earnestly: hmm, i thought i tried that but it didn't work. good to know.
<earnestly>	charlesatum: maybe, microsoft research is full of phds
<earnestly>	hannibal_smith: interesting find
<earnestly>	it also has move semantics via 'consume'
<earnestly>	and destructive read
<hannibal_smith>	earnestly, if i remember well, this stuff is also patentend by ms
<demize>	i have a friend who recently got a phd in uw, was a bit sad when he got a job at ms ;p
<earnestly>	so you can swap with: a = b = a
<demize>	he's doing some work on cortana or somesuch
<charlesatum>	let's fork pony with the name punny, before microsoft takes over.
<earnestly>	charlesatum: it's already gpl license
<earnestly>	which is interesting for a language...
<hyo0301>	appledash: is there another way to do it then? daemontools works for ubuntu
<charlesatum>	i will still pronounce pony as punny
<appledash>	it shouldn't...
<hyo0301>	appledash:  i don't have an usb or a disk
<demize>	earnestly: anyway, this is interesting.
<appledash>	daemon tools only mounts images inside of windows, you can't boot from a dt mounted image...
<earnestly>	demize: still seems very new and lacks a decent reference
<charlesatum>	wait, what about the livecd?
<hyo0301>	so i'm uncapable of installing arch linux?
<demize>	earnestly: agreed, will be interesting to see how it turns out too.
<hyo0301>	great, wasted hours on supports and tutorials^^
<holomorph>	\o/
<charlesatum>	buy a usb flash drive .-.
<hyo0301>	i have one
<earnestly>	demize: ponyc also uses the directory as the program name and can basically do all the dependency management and linking itself, like make does, for you
<demize>	yeah, i'm reading the tutorial now
<earnestly>	heh, pony is only x86_64 atm
<earnestly>	but it uses llvm
<demize>	;p
<earnestly>	demize: i am a little worried about them constantly refering to bignums as u64 or u128
<demize>	what o.o
<earnestly>	"it'll be big enough" kind of mentality
<earnestly>	but anyway, if "not working on 32bit x86" is any indication, it's how new this is
<charlesatum>	isn't that good? .-.
<earnestly>	no
<charlesatum>	does it compile to arm?
<demize>	it would be one thing if it was some weird arch that took a lot of code to maintan support for, but..
<earnestly>	it compiles so easily, was easy to package except i install'd the bits myself since it hardcodes /usr/local
<earnestly>	charlesatum: no
<earnestly>	charlesatum: x86_64 only
<charlesatum>	hmm
<charlesatum>	did, hyo0301 give up?
<charlesatum>	dam tab complete adding commas
<hyo0301>	yes
<hyo0301>	i can't do anything...
<hyo0301>	can't even isntall ubuntu
<charlesatum>	not even in a vm?
<charlesatum>	wait, wasn't there a bot abuse channel?
<hugosthlm>	catalyst stable was in conflict with linux 4. i installed catalyst beta, but have some problems. any idea when i can go back to catalyst stable?
<demize>	charlesatum: #archlinux-botabuse, yes.
<hyo0301>	vm works very well charlesatum, i can install pretty much any distro in there
<charlesatum>	so, you want the true experience of your hardware not working most of times, right?
<hyo0301>	actually i just want rice and anime
<hyo0301>	but that's fine too
<thelemonman>	rice and anime ?
<teraflop>	paella?
<jasabella>	hi
<thelemonman>	i like mine with soy sauce, meat, peas and a fistful of chopped onions
<thelemonman>	and an egg if i'm feeling in the right mood
<earnestly>	demize: yay pony is like k
<earnestly>	demize: "pony takes a different approach and outlaws infix precedence. any expression where more than one infix operator is used must use parentheses to remove the ambiguity."
<jasabella>	is it preferred that fstab use uuid or labels?
<soulescaper>	uuid
<demize>	earnestly: ooh, that's nice.
<jasabella>	beccause labels can change right?
<jasabella>	whereas uuid are fixed
<demize>	more likely to conflict too
<earnestly>	if you use labels then namespace them with the machines hostname or something
<rgb-one>	hey
<lindenk>	thelemonman: i misread that as a fistful of egg at first
<jasabella>	i am guessing base group for pacman sets up a minimal posix compliant system
<earnestly>	zeus-root for example, because calling it 'root' can easily conflict if you decide in 5 years to call the next partition root on a second harddrive
<rgb-one>	how can i add a guest account?
<jasabella>	ahhh
<earnestly>	i just use uuids now because of that ._.
<rgb-one>	as seen on ubuntu and its dirivatives
<earnestly>	demize: new create(env: env) => basically is your entry point (argc, argv[]) into main, fwiw.
<earnestly>	demize: you can see env.pony in builtins/
<demize>	argh, damned keybindings
<demize>	heh, both traits and interfaces.
<earnestly>	demize: well, old ideas.  anyway, can't have top-level functions, so basically every function has to be part of a type (class) ;/
<meaulnes>	is there a way to test a new crypttab without a reboot?
<demize>	mmm...
<demize>	earnestly: at least the concurrency/sequentiality thing is sort of a good reason for it, imo
<earnestly>	demize: what class should 'min' be part of?
<earnestly>	it doesn't always make sense
<earnestly>	maybe they think class == submodules or something
<earnestly>	demize: oh
<demize>	well, min is part of the type primitive
<earnestly>	yeah
<earnestly>	that's okay actually
<earnestly>	except
<earnestly>	they have to redefine min over and over and over again for all primitive types
<earnestly>	a nice solution to a generic min is to just take an alternative function object that does the comparison
<earnestly>	e.g. if you were to compare your "manager" type
<demize>	hmm, can a primitive be part of a trait?
<earnestly>	the way they're doing this is kind of werbose
<earnestly>	w/v
<earnestly>	"there is no overloading of methods in pony." :s
<demize>	i'm guessing no.
<demize>	mmmmm...
<earnestly>	that sucks
<earnestly>	welp, it was easy to package, i'll see where it goes, it's sort of interesting
<demize>	hmm, there's a section about polymorphic methods but it's not written yet..
<earnestly>	yeah, that's why we'll have to see
<holomorph>	yep, a lot of sections are missing
<demize>	mmm, haskellian match.
<earnestly>	well, also erlang and rust and clojure
<earnestly>	except in erlang it's '='
<pankid>	what is the best way to untar a .tgz and overwrite a directory similar to how rsync --delete works?
<soulescaper>	file roller is great
<demize>	mmm, i just always think of haskell. i've never looked at erlang actually, i should sometime.
<earnestly>	demize: erlang in anger :p
<demize>	hmm, danke
<earnestly>	demize: basically about erlang as if it was written by someone who has been around the block
<demize>	heh, same author also wrote "learn you some erlang for great good!"
<earnestly>	"read the source" is one of the most annoying things to be told, but dealing with erlang programmers, you’ll have to do it often. either the documentation for a library will be incomplete, outdated, or just not there.in other cases, erlang programmers are a bit similar to lispers in that they will tend to write libraries that will solve their problems and not really test or try them in other
<earnestly>	circumstances, leaving it to you to extend or fix issues that arise in new contexts.
<gendale_>	has anybody used refind with a macbook?
<earnestly>	demize: that's kind of what the book is like
<earnestly>	"don't drink the koolaid" which is what learn you some erlang constantly reminded people of
<deusstultus>	there any general consensus in these waters on preferred aur helper?
<earnestly>	deusstultus: ideally none
<demize>	cower is handy though.
<earnestly>	ideally you'd keep the pkgbuilds after downloading with cower
<demize>	without doing too much
<holomorph>	cower is a glorified tarball downloader and search thingy
<demize>	indeed
<holomorph>	quite useful
<demize>	i mostly just get a package, clean it up, and then use my own copy
<earnestly>	deusstultus: but ultimately, once you learn about it yourself, you can answer that question for yourself and know the pitfalls and what to do
<robtaylor>	test
<dchw>	for me the benefits of cower are that it does very little, but if there are other aur  packages it needs to get too i can make cower download those as well. that way i dont have to download a ton of crap
<earnestly>	!check if robtaylor's test succeeded
<phrik>	testing if robtaylor's test succeeded: [pass]
<robtaylor>	earnestly: heh, thanks :)
<robtaylor>	as i was just saying to earnestly,  the o'reilly book on erlang is good and has some really nice approaches to thinking about concurrent design
<tomty89>	!give robtaylor hi
<phrik>	robtaylor: hi tomty89
<demize>	hmm
<demize>	  fun _fmt_int(fmt: intformat): (u64, string, string) =>
<demize>	    match fmt
<demize>	    | intbinary => (2, "b0", _large())
<earnestly>	robtaylor: the only issue with those books, and what i kind of appreciate about the approach taken in the others, is that they don't hype the language at all.  they're usually quite critical of it in fact and tell you how to use proper tools and approaches to even use it.
<earnestly>	i like critical books because i gain more value from what something cannot do
<robtaylor>	still haven't managed to write much in earlng, but definitly reused some design concepts..
<robtaylor>	oh yes, its certainly good when books are more critical rather than drinking the kool-aid
<arch-tk>	demize: what language is that?
<demize>	arch-tk: pony
<robtaylor>	but still, worth a read, a google will find you a pdf
<arch-tk>	really?
<demize>	quite so.
<arch-tk>	hmm
<arch-tk>	there's two (i guess)
<raj>	is arch not considered systemd free or something? it's not in the list at the end of this blog post, although gentoo is. https://igurublog.wordpress.com/2015/05/04/kdbus-systemds-kid-cousin-come-to-stay/

<arch-tk>	fim++ and pony-lang
<earnestly>	robtaylor: bookzz.org will also find you a pdf, but i didn't tell you that
<earnestly>	raj: if it's ignorantguru, don't waste your time
<earnestly>	raj: just don't read it
<arch-tk>	when i last googled "pony programming language" all i saw was fim++
<raj>	earnestly, why's that?
<tomty89>	systemd-free?
<earnestly>	raj: it's the most baseless, unresearched, paranoia invested drivel written by anyone
<tomty89>	i think that means "without systemd"
<demize>	raj: arch was one of the first distros to use systemd, so it would be exceedingly dumb if it was.
<holomorph>	raj: fud fud fud fud
<demize>	raj: and because he's really ignorant.
<arch-tk>	weird
<raj>	earnestly, anything i can read the counter his claims?
<earnestly>	raj: i speak to you, an intelligent person, and my recommendation is to avoid that garbage.  either that or actually substantiate his work
<earnestly>	raj: the lkml threads where kdbus is discussed
<raj>	*that
<earnestly>	he said he quit, either he's just as stupid or changed
<raj>	he said he quit what?
<earnestly>	yeah, more random crap
<earnestly>	raj: linux
<demize>	earnestly: https://github.com/causalityltd/ponyc/issues/145 that seems to be how they do it
<phrik>	title: polymorphic functions can only bind type params once · issue #145 · causalityltd/ponyc · github (at github.com)
<raj>	no, he said he was sitting back to wait and see what happens with decisions being made on the kernel
<earnestly>	raj: long ago
<earnestly>	raj: anyway, it's more emotional and unsubstantiate bullshit.  i don't see how anyone can tolerate reading this
<diegoviola>	i hope gnome is more stable this time
<earnestly>	"even if you don’t mind that nsa toy red hat single-handedly controls xorg, udev, etc"
<raj>	oh, i only started following him about 2 years ago when i started using spacefm
<earnestly>	are you serious?
<raj>	which is undoubtedly the best fm of the very many i tried
<holomorph>	was your first question actually serious
<raj>	he took a hiatus soon after i started following the project on github though
<earnestly>	he lists manjaro has systemd free, quality research as usual
<raj>	earnestly, that was an exageration, of course, but the nsa does try to convince major corporations to leave a backdoor for them
<earnestly>	raj: you do not throw around accusations like that without evidence
<diegoviola>	all distros have systemd these days, the only that doesn't is slackware and gentoo, right?
<earnestly>	raj: he's just an intellectually dishonest moron
<diegoviola>	and crux
<demize>	diegoviola: gentoo supports systemd though
<ecraven>	i don't use it on arch either
<agregory>	earnestly: well, manjaro does officially support openrc
<raj>	earnestly, all i have to say is his fm is really freaking good though
<ecraven>	openrc works ok for me
<earnestly>	raj: that's irrelevant
<diegoviola>	demize: yep
<holomorph>	this discussion is still happening
<earnestly>	raj: i could say his code quality was garbage too, but that's also irrelevant
<diegoviola>	debian will already install systemd by default, so does the latest ubuntu, no?
<earnestly>	raj: it took years to debunk his fud article about gtk3 to countless idiots who fell for it and spammed it in this channel, i'd rather he actually quit for good
<raj>	earnestly, what's fossforce? reliable?
<earnestly>	no idea what that is

<diegoviola>	what are the default keyboard shortcuts for sending a window to another desktop, etc?

<wasamasa>	i'm shocked

<earnestly>	diegoviola: ctrl-alt-up/down
<demize>	wasamasa: they do.
<wasamasa>	demize: well, it was listed in this guy's crapfest
<demize>	wasamasa: <agregory> earnestly: well, manjaro does officially support openrc
<holomorph>	and archlinux should care
<diegoviola>	earnestly: thanks
<wasamasa>	demize: hmk
<diegoviola>	ctrl+alt+shift up/down will move windows, nice
<luizrpgluiz>	i wonder why they removed the text mode installer of new versions of linux arch?
<earnestly>	it's a lot of modifers really, maybe you can change that somehow
<earnestly>	luizrpgluiz: it basically broke and no one wanted to fix it
<tomty89>	hmm one shouldn't be listed as systemd-free unless its official repos do not provide systemd at all
<wasamasa>	luizrpgluiz: because it was broken and nobody wanted to fix it up
<diegoviola>	i really like this
<wasamasa>	!judges
<phrik>	it was very close, but wasamasa won by a nose!
<earnestly>	luizrpgluiz: it had two pages of critical bugs, dave wrote a simple script that automated the chroot and bootstrap of pacman and found it was even better
<earnestly>	luizrpgluiz: it's similar to nix-install or debootstrap or that fedora one if you're familiar.  turns out the new method is clearer and simpler which makes scripting even easier.  it just seems difficult at first
<raj>	earnestly, looking further into it, there are troves of people on both sides of this issue about red hat implementing code at the request of the nsa: http://techrights.org/2014/01/17/rhel-security/
<phrik>	title: for real security, use centos — never rhel — and run neither on amazon’s servers | techrights (at techrights.org)
<raj>	the comments are informative as well
<raj>	for both sides of the issue
<earnestly>	raj: no citation again
<holomorph>	!literal judges
<phrik>	holomorph: <reply>it was very close, but $nick won by a nose!
<raj>	fair point
<earnestly>	follow the source
<earnestly>	always
<earnestly>	any claim without a source is basically worthless
<raj>	oh, you're right, ignorantguru's been saying this stuff for a while now
<raj>	guess i wasn't signed up for his mailing list until late last year
<raj>	earnestly, do you trust assange's direct quotes regarding the nsa and red hat?
<earnestly>	raj: not quite, but i'm sure he has a citation
<earnestly>	to show for it
<earnestly>	nsa did work on selinux which is heavily used in linux distros like redhat
<raj>	that's certainly concerning
<earnestly>	they also made tons of standards which people through were good, security guides, everything.  all of that is now put into question
<earnestly>	basically they're not trustable now.  accusations of malicious intent needs evidence though
<earnestly>	otherwise it's just slander
<raj>	the nsa is a secretive organization with dubious intentions even for its own nation's citizens. evidence is difficult to come by
<earnestly>	not anymore thanks to snowden ;p
<raj>	it was suggested many eyars ago that they were wiretapping. it took a long time before snowden came along to release all that information
<earnestly>	also, apparently there's a register called 'dil', i've not seen this before
<raj>	until snowden proved it, everyone thought accusers were wearing a tinfoil hat
<earnestly>	ah
<earnestly>	raj: and that's fair
<earnestly>	demize: the passing of capabilities wrt origin and reciever and blegh is going to be a bit confusing for awhile
<raj>	anyway, if a paranoid person is happy with a linux kernel, i can feel safer
<earnestly>	raj: well, you'd use grsecurity (for anything internet facing anyway)
<ox33>	hi all... could someone explain to me why i am able to watch flash videos using gstreamer and gst-libav. i dont even have adobe flash installed. im glad that it works, i just didnt expect it
<earnestly>	explain what you're doing
<diegoviola>	is 8 gb of ram still good enough for running a modern linux desktop with few vms and for doing development? or i need 16gb?
<diegoviola>	reason i ask: looking for a new laptop but don't want to spend too much
<earnestly>	demize: going to switch to debug builds since you get all of this: https://github.com/causalityltd/ponyc/blob/master/src/ponyc/main.c#l102
<phrik>	title: ponyc/main.c at master · causalityltd/ponyc · github (at github.com)
<ox33>	earnestly: i was fiddling around with mozplugger, mpv and stuff, and it never worked. then i just installed gstreamer and gst-libav, and suddenly every single video on the internet works. embedded.
<earnestly>	ox33: what /exactly/ are you doing?
<ox33>	earnestly: visiting golem.de/videos, watching videos.
<holomorph>	html5 is catching on
<earnestly>	ox33: html5
<ox33>	earnestly: how did you know so fast?
<earnestly>	firefox uses gstreamer for html5 video that requires patent encumbered formats such as h264
<diegoviola>	i wonder what in the gnome group is pulling pulseaudio-alsa
<earnestly>	diegoviola: pulseaudio does
<earnestly>	ox33: and i assumed firefox since you mentioned mozplugger
<ox33>	yeah, i am using firefox
<diegoviola>	earnestly: well, pulseaudio shows it as an optional dep
<earnestly>	ox33: mpv can watch most via youtube-dl as well, that will work for non-html5 as well as html5 most of the time
<earnestly>	diegoviola: *shrug*, you should have it anywayt
<diegoviola>	earnestly: yeah it doesn't hurt
<earnestly>	it's pretty required
<diegoviola>	earnestly: i tried to live without it when all my apps were using pulse
<earnestly>	there is no reason to not use it
<earnestly>	(well, no valid reasons)
<ox33>	earnestly: how do you incorporate youtube-dl into your workflow? ive been using it from the command line to download yt videos
<earnestly>	ox33: mpv has builtin support for it
<earnestly>	ox33: find a way to make passing urls to mpv simple and you've solved it
<earnestly>	or if you're not using mpv, `mplayer "$(youtube-dl -g "$url")"`
<earnestly>	i think vlc does its own thing and should work with many sites too
<diegoviola>	swapping is not just for "i'm out of ram and i need more" right? it's a way for the kernel to offload some processes, right? you still want swap even if you had 1tb of ram?
<diegoviola>	sorry if my question happens to be stupid
<earnestly>	sure, kernel can purge dirty pages
<diegoviola>	hrm
<earnestly>	you don't need a big swap for that though
<jasabella>	ummm
<dacoit>	cold pages can be put into swap so the active pages are closer together too
<earnestly>	50-200m is enough for that
<jasabella>	i just catted a binary file and the terminal has turned into garbage

<jasabella>	cool
<fireboot>	(i start it by doing startx)

<jasabella>	i wouldnt even know ow yo google for that one!!
<earnestly>	jasabella: that's also lame, i'll find the proper one
<jasabella>	how ti
<fireboot>	any idea how to solve this? i'mrunning out of ideas
<dacoit>	fireboot: we need more details pal
<earnestly>	jasabella: again, reset is the sort of overkill approach.  you can type certain sequences to fix certain kinds of corruption, but ain't nobody got time for that
<fireboot>	dacoit: hmmm, ask ke anything
<fireboot>	me*
<jasabella>	yup
<fireboot>	i don't know what you need
<dacoit>	fireboot: any error when you try to startx as your error?
<dacoit>	fireboot: and have you looked at the x log

<earnestly>	(tldp is not normally very good)
<sudokode>	ugh laws
<sudokode>	i spent an hour trying to talk legalese to someone
<earnestly>	fireboot: if it starts as a new user then it's clearly a kde configuration issue
<sudokode>	this idiot is worried about her hardwood floors so she's trying to figure out how to deny a renter with a service dog a week rental
<fireboot>	earnestly: i went as far as deleting ~/.config
<sudokode>	and she's gonna end up getting sued
<earnestly>	sudokode: what an ass
<sudokode>	if not getting everyone sued
<fireboot>	~/.kde4 (no idea why this gets created,i'm using kde5)
<fireboot>	and everything is /run/user/1000
<fireboot>	if you know anything else i should delete let me know
<earnestly>	fireboot: that's probably a tad overkill
<sudokode>	well, she has to spend money to accomodate this person and she can't legally pass that charge off to them
<earnestly>	sudokode: too right
<sudokode>	only if they do damage can she seek damages
<earnestly>	sure
<fireboot>	earnestly: well i was supposed to work tonight, then this happened when i turned on thecomputer
<earnestly>	sudokode: she could also just say no, right?  i mean, private business can do that
<earnestly>	don't need a reason
<sudokode>	but she's got it in her head that the ada doesn't cover inside her unit, only the fha does
<sudokode>	earnestly: nope
<earnestly>	fireboot: :s
<n00balert>	fireboot: share xserver log maybe?
<fireboot>	working on it pal
<sudokode>	well, that's the grey area
<earnestly>	sudokode: still, ethically fucked up
<sudokode>	if she falls under the fha, she has to abide by that. and it specifies pretty much the same thing as the ada
<caralla>	hello! is there a kernel parameter to set the gateway? i need it for pxe+nfs boot. my kernel parameter is ip=dhcp but i have to execute ip route add default via <gateway> dev eth0 after each boot. is it possible to extend the ip paremter somehow?
<sudokode>	which is there is no certification required for service animals and there can be no special fees or charges for them
<sudokode>	but in the case of the fha, it covers all animals
<sudokode>	the ada was changed in 2011 to only cover dogs and oddly enough miniature horses
<sudokode>	but still. there's really not much she can do without opening up a huge can of worms
<sudokode>	it's inconvenient, but it's only fair
<diegoviola>	i'm pretty impressed with gnome, it's so nice to use
<nizumzen>	diegoviola: heh use xfce and you'll never go back to gnome
<earnestly>	diegoviola: don't be afraid to learn about dconf and gnome-settings-daemon stuff
<diegoviola>	nizumzen: i actually switched from xfce to gnome
<nizumzen>	:|
<sudokode>	earnestly: the ada is amazingly overreaching though
<sudokode>	and the details can slaughter businesses

<sudokode>	doors have to be a certain width and height

<nizumzen>	sudokode: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/guide_horse.jpg
<earnestly>	fireboot: server terminated successfully (0).
<sudokode>	things like that. the details start small then become structural changes
<sudokode>	nizumzen: indeed
<fireboot>	yeah earnestly i thought so
<diegoviola>	earnestly: i'll look into those, thanks
<fireboot>	and i'm currently talking to you with a new user on the same machine
<earnestly>	although intel(0): failed to set backlight intel_backlight for output edp1, disabling is also a bit odd

<nizumzen>	sudokode: so cute :)
<sudokode>	yes, i love miniature horses
<earnestly>	fireboot: how do you start kde?
<diegoviola>	nizumzen: xfce is fine but i like how modern the shell looks in gnome, although it takes some time to get used to

<sudokode>	they're even adorable when they're trapped in a hole
<nizumzen>	diegoviola: i tried gnome 3 once - lasted about 20 minutes
<earnestly>	fireboot: how exactly, with an argument, with an xinitrc?
<thrice>	earnestly: e has been kind of rough for the last year, so i was on gnome for a bit
<dacoit>	is that lil' sebastian?
<nizumzen>	sudokode: heh
<earnestly>	thrice: ah
<fireboot>	with a .xinitrc containing exec startkde
<fireboot>	you want the full .xinitrc?
<diegoviola>	nizumzen: it's not too bad once you get to know the keybindings and stuff
<earnestly>	fireboot: is your new users xinitrc different?
<diegoviola>	nizumzen: it feels like pretty much anything else then
<diegoviola>	well not quite
<earnestly>	fireboot: diff -u them for mechanical assistence
<thrice>	the enlightenment libraries and toolkit are really cool, but the window manager is kind of lacking direction
<earnestly>	i can understand that
<sudokode>	earnestly: in any case, there's not much she can do, but if she does the wrong thing, it could be the entire property in trouble instead of just her
<fireboot>	earnestly: i cp'ed it between users
<fireboot>	so it should be identical
<fireboot>	but i will check
<sudokode>	and the person she's dealing with is a relative of one of the other owners, who they don't get along with. and apparently he's some asshole with a bunch of lawyers
<fireboot>	i confirm, they are identical according todiff
<sudokode>	so i don't doubt this could turn into a big shit
<earnestly>	fireboot: that's very perculiar
<fireboot>	earnestly: i don't get the intel_backlight error in the new user's xorg log
<earnestly>	fireboot: do you get the log entry about the intel backlight in the xorg log for the new u... heh
<fireboot>	[   496.732] (--) intel(0): found backlight control interface intel_backlight (type 'raw') for output edp1
<fireboot>	(in the new user's log)
<earnestly>	i wonder how the backlight being disabled causes xorg to just stop
<earnestly>	fireboot: is the new user running on a different tty?
<fireboot>	yes
<fireboot>	tty3
<earnestly>	fireboot: does your user, on that tty, also fail?
<fireboot>	i will try earnestly, but i will have to close irc
<fireboot>	back in 2 minutes
<earnestly>	fireboot: use quassel ;p
<fireboot>	it's too high tech for me :)
<diegoviola>	thinking about trying emacs next
<diegoviola>	well, emacs+evil

<fireboot>	still the same problem on tty3
<n00balert>	and in vi ...pff
<fireboot>	let me upload the pictures of the error
<earnestly>	fireboot: that's very weird then
<d_garbage>	poor old mcedit, never gets a mention
<earnestly>	fireboot: outside of sanity checks like left over sockets in /tmp or other running xservers but even that should be fine
<earnestly>	maybe .drirc files
<fireboot>	i rebooted like 20 times so i doubt there would be anything left in /tmp
<n00balert>	fireboot: what  happens when you startx...blank screen?
<fireboot>	i actually see the kde wallpaper and the loading bar
<fireboot>	for like 1 second
<fireboot>	then it goes back to the tty
<earnestly>	the fact it works as another user really just makes no sense

<diegoviola>	i recall gstreamer devs saying they switched from ffmpeg to libav for political reasons (hence the gst-libav and the outdated gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg), i wonder if installing gst-libav will pull something else from libav though? or is it a self-contained thing?
<earnestly>	.cache (or unlikely, .local/share) are the two last locations i can think of

<fireboot>	okay
<fireboot>	i will try
<fireboot>	back in one minute
<fireboot>	earnestly: holy cow
<fireboot>	you saved the day
<earnestly>	it was .cache?
<fireboot>	nop.
<fireboot>	.local/share
<earnestly>	but what inside .local/share?
<fireboot>	i just deleted everything
<earnestly>	:/
<fireboot>	in .local/share
<earnestly>	fireboot: welp, that and .config means you'll have to reconfigure basically everything

<mrelendig>	can't bridge, have to do forwarding
<earnestly>	fireboot: welp, i'm still very confused but okay :p
<fireboot>	derpadong: .xinitrc wasn't the problem. i could start kde with another server using the exact same .xinitrc
<thrice>	maybe a b0rked config file
<earnestly>	thrice: checked too
<fireboot>	it was something in .local/share
<derpadong>	lmao
<fireboot>	oh well
<earnestly>	i don't know what kde stores there
<fireboot>	nobody knows
<derpadong>	shit files
<derpadong>	lol
<fireboot>	nobody knows what kde does
<earnestly>	fireboot: if i used kde, i would
<fireboot>	that thing is becoming worse very day
<n00balert>	fireboot: what's the permission/mask on xinit?
<fireboot>	every*
<derpadong>	i use xfce.
<derpadong>	lmao
<earnestly>	fireboot: fwiw: http://ix.io/ihx
<fireboot>	cheers
<derpadong>	do you even linux bruh?
<sudokode>	does bsd count?
<fireboot>	earnestly: fair game, but i'm not really interested in where my de stores its config files
<derpadong>	maybe
<fireboot>	so that's why i don't know what it's there
<neuroserpens>	mrelendig: why don't you just send the wiki entry? what do you win from saying shit that doesn't get anyone anywhere? wtf
<earnestly>	fireboot: that was just so i didn't have to type out what .local/share stored
<fireboot>	no i was responding to:
<fireboot>	[01:18] <earnestly> fireboot: if i used kde, i would
<earnestly>	fireboot: i like to know
<sudokode>	lol, none of them should be set by default unless systemd does it
<sudokode>	there's a surprise
<fireboot>	yeah fair enough
<earnestly>	fireboot: that way i wouldn't spend 2 hours if something breaks :p
<derpadong>	i should use windows 7 on my other hdd
<derpadong>	xd
<earnestly>	it's usually simple enough too
<sudokode>	wait this is ridiculous
<earnestly>	fireboot: i wonder if it's something like using an external projector, you turned off your main edp and then didn't turn it back on, kde stored that change and... yeah
<fireboot>	i've been using kde for over 10 years but i'm tempted to try something else
<guest86881>	hello
<sudokode>	why does youtube list things in its autoplay that are unlisted
<sudokode>	bugggggg
<fireboot>	ah, yes earnestly very likely
<earnestly>	sudokode: because programming
<fireboot>	at work i use a docking station
<sudokode>	earnestly: amazingly, i submitted a sort of issue with youtube's ui. they have a nice little reporting tool actually
<fireboot>	with a monitor plugged on it. as well as another monitor plugged on the laptop
<sudokode>	anyway, that issue is now fixed
<sudokode>	it was basically "please add a thing to the playlist feature so that you can't duplicate added videos"
<sudokode>	and now you'll notice if you go to "add to playlist" it gives you a nice checklist
<earnestly>	sudokode: lazy loading of video tiles that breaks without javascript instead of offering fallback page links is eeeh.
<sudokode>	:d
<fireboot>	but yeah at work when i dock my computer it takes like 20-30 seconds before the screens light up and the system is responsive
<fireboot>	we are talking about a quadcore haswell laptop
<fireboot>	high end
<sudokode>	i actually don't get why this video is unlisted in the first place. none of the ones similar to it are
<sudokode>	but it doesn't seem like it should end up in their autoplay section if it is unlisted
<fireboot>	earnestly: what de/wm do you use?
<earnestly>	fireboot: i3 primarily, sort of switching to orbment now and then
<earnestly>	fireboot: https://github.com/cloudef/orbment
<phrik>	title: cloudef/orbment · github (at github.com)
<fireboot>	looks neat
<earnestly>	fireboot: if i was serious about xorg, i'd use stumpwm though, or xmonad
<sudokode>	earnestly: don't know if you've ever seen their reporting tool, so let me scrot this for you
<earnestly>	but i3 is lazy
<earnestly>	sudokode: i've seen it before
<fireboot>	i tried e18 some time ago, it looked very slick and was using very little resources
<fireboot>	but some key stuff were not working properly
<sudokode>	oh well. fuck it
<fireboot>	like multiscreen support
<sudokode>	http://a.pomf.se/uxueav.png
<earnestly>	thrice: if i was planning on using it
<sudokode>	it's at least useful if you wanna point parts of the screen
<fireboot>	i have a bit of an exotic setup, i can't afford redoing everything manually twice a dya
<fireboot>	day
<fireboot>	when it comes to screens
<earnestly>	sudokode: yeah, instead of ye olde days when you had to throw that crap in gimp and put a badly drawn red blurry circle around something
<sudokode>	:d
<diegoviola>	do you notice any differences in performance with those wayland compositors than running a x tiling wm?
<earnestly>	wayland is much faster and at a fraction of the resources and vsync'd
<earnestly>	orbment uses almost 1/4 of the memory xwayland (xorg) needs
<diegoviola>	nice
<earnestly>	while displaying a glsl animated wallpaper...
<thrice>	but until a time without xwayland exists...
<sudokode>	earnestly: which is great because it actually encourages people to submit problems
<earnestly>	thrice: it doesn't
<sudokode>	or even feature requests
<sudokode>	which, in my case, it appears they listened to
<earnestly>	sudokode: i guess so
<diegoviola>	thrice: here's waiting for firefox/gimp/libreoffice to get their gtk3 port done
<sudokode>	i'm sure i wasn't the only one complaining about that but still
<sudokode>	it's good to see change
<earnestly>	sudokode: well, it's certainly better interface than bugzilla
<thrice>	yeah, the most popular apps are the ones that will take forever
<sudokode>	lol yeah
<earnestly>	diegoviola: just using gtk3 isn't enough though
<earnestly>	diegoviola: xul is very heavily attached to x11
<diegoviola>	earnestly: i see
<earnestly>	vimserver uses x11 ipc for example
<thrice>	thankfully, chromium isn't :>
<diegoviola>	isn't xul just a wrapper to gtk though?
<diegoviola>	or it's something completely different?
<earnestly>	nope, xul is their toolkit
<earnestly>	gtk is used for a few widgets
<diegoviola>	interesting
<sudokode>	earnestly: but that's not entirely true because you can theme firefox from xul or via gtk
<sudokode>	at least the interface parts
<sudokode>	that's kinda confusing
<earnestly>	sudokode: not quite
<earnestly>	you still need userchrome.css, that's xul
<sudokode>	hm
<earnestly>	@namespace url("http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul");
<sudokode>	heh
<earnestly>	"xul (xml user interface language) is mozilla's xml-based language for building user interfaces of applications like firefox."
<earnestly>	consider you can write programs in xul
<earnestly>	like conkeror
<diegoviola>	i wonder if wxwidgets already supports wayland (to run dolphin)
<sudokode>	i think we're discussing xulrunner in this case
<sudokode>	which is their xul interpreter
<earnestly>	sudokode: sure
<namarrgon>	diegoviola: isn't there a gui written in qt for it?
<sudokode>	or runtime environment
<diegoviola>	namarrgon: for dolphin?
<diegoviola>	namarrgon: not sure, i think i've seen dolphin running natively on wayland
<namarrgon>	diegoviola: the emulator?
<sudokode>	so if that's their re, they must base that re around a local render
<diegoviola>	!yt dolphin emulator wayland
<earnestly>	dolphin works on wayland, has pretty much from day one
<phrik>	diegoviola: dolphin glsl wayland egl - youtube: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zdxu1vm_vq>
<diegoviola>	yep
<sudokode>	like firefox in windows appears like windows and in linux, it appears like gtk
<sudokode>	but you can theme firefox through 2 different means
<earnestly>	sudokode: it uses gtk for some of the widgets, like input boxes, tooltips, etc.
<sudokode>	via all the internal addons like themes and extensions
<sudokode>	but also through gtk
<sudokode>	or the window's content renderer
<sudokode>	whatever it be
<earnestly>	sudokode: heftig would know more
<diegoviola>	@hdkr | we dropped our wayland backend
<diegoviola>	@hdkr | because it impeded improvements to dolphin and also licensing issues
<diegoviola>	wth
<earnestly>	*shrug*
<sudokode>	hah
<namarrgon>	diegoviola: https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/blob/9f86d3efcf1f687f5cfbe69b081aeeedb0cb9bb9/externals/wxwidgets3/src/gtk/toplevel.cpp#l43

<diegoviola>	dolphin emulator wayland backend
<namarrgon>	diegoviola: some bits are still in there but they also have a working qt frontend
<diegoviola>	well they're open for a rewrite at least
<mrelendig>	i wonder about what "licensing issues" that would be
<diegoviola>	ask in #dolphin-emu
<mrelendig>	maybe it would force them to truly open their code :p
<sudokode>	dolphin-emu is fanstastically useless
<sudokode>	i can't think of any wii game worth it
<diegoviola>	how is it useless?
<earnestly>	sudokode: killer 7? :p
<selby>	=(
<diegoviola>	sudokode: resident evil remake
<sudokode>	wtf is that
<earnestly>	sudokode: wtf is what you'd say playing it
<mrelendig>	there are some jrpgs that are worth playing
<fireboot>	dolphin-emu is a fantastic project
<braindamage>	there's decent gamecube games
<earnestly>	sudokode: anyway, it does gamecube, so that's nice
<fireboot>	what they have accomplished is insane
<sudokode>	i'm familiar with it
<sudokode>	it's a hell of an emulator
<braindamage>	i wish there was a libretro interface for dolphin :/
<sudokode>	especially since it does full 1080p for games that are only 720p
<earnestly>	braindamage: there is
<earnestly>	braindamage: :p
<sudokode>	but still... wii
<fireboot>	i know one of the lead devs. smartest man i've met
<braindamage>	earnestly: ok, append, a working one
<earnestly>	braindamage: probably doesn't work
<fireboot>	or one of them at the very least
<earnestly>	hehe
<earnestly>	braindamage: it's like the ppsspp core which didn't work for ages
<earnestly>	they seem very focused on mupen
<earnestly>	mame doesn't build ;/
<braindamage>	earnestly: i know the repo existance, but doesn't compile, and even when it used to, it didn't work
<earnestly>	even final burn alpha fails now
<sudokode>	has mame ever built? :p
<earnestly>	sudokode: it takes soooo long
<braindamage>	i wish there were less fights and more upstream projects willing to merge the api
<earnestly>	braindamage: sp can be a bit, yeah
<sudokode>	earnestly: as long as xulrunner? :d
<earnestly>	sudokode: longer
<sudokode>	since you build firefox, you also have to build the xulrunner package
<sudokode>	god back then i only had dual core too
<braindamage>	also lot of people doing projection and boycotting the work because they have a gripe with the author instead of actually analyzing the technical pro and cons
<earnestly>	sudokode: probably as long as both firefox and xul
<sudokode>	firefox takes almost no time actually
<sudokode>	maybe 5-10 minutes whereas xulrunner can take over an hour
<earnestly>	sudokode: any way, it takes a long time since it basically builds hundreds of kernels
<hyo0301>	help!
<selby>	help!
<hyo0301>	i might die
<monkz>	!pleh
<selby>	!give hyo0301 help
<phrik>	hyo0301: help [<plugin>] [<command>]
<earnestly>	fortunately i have all the object files so hopefully when it's fixed i won't have to rebuild them all
<diegoviola>	trying gnome in wayland mode and it flickers like crazy, wth
<sudokode>	hyo0301: /quit ; call 9-1-1
<thrice>	ugh, building ff is one of the reasons i stopped using crux
<hyo0301>	;d
<selby>	hyo0301: stop, drop, roll
<hyo0301>	stop the memes
<monkz>	hyo0301: pacman -r die
<hyo0301>	http://puu.sh/hbdtx/46b7b27fbd.png
<hyo0301>	i can't set sda1 to boot
<earnestly>	what?
<sudokode>	hyo0301: you're misunderstanding something
<earnestly>	1) what did you do 2) what did you expect 3) what happened
<sudokode>	something makes me think you're trying to set swap to a linux swap type and also trying to set boot to linux boot type, which is not a thing
<sudokode>	so cease and desist
<sudokode>	go down to the next partition, hit 't', then enter 82 for linux swap
<sudokode>	oh wait, you're in cfdisk
<hyo0301>	no no no no no no
<sudokode>	you'll figure it out
<earnestly>	partition types don't matter anyway
<hyo0301>	look  at this dude http://puu.sh/hbe3f/5361a5d4f0.png
<mrelendig>	systemd will do magic with swap though
<hyo0301>	he can set any sda to "bootable" i don't have that option
<earnestly>	hyo0301: not needed
<sudokode>	hyo0301: oh, quit that tool you're in
<sudokode>	fdisk /dev/sda
<sudokode>	then 'a' '1' enter
<escondida>	hyo0301: also, you really don't need a 10 gb /boot
<sudokode>	that flag is also... not always necessary
<sudokode>	if you're using syslinux, it'll set that for you
<hexhaxtron>	i got a problem with virtualbox. i wanted to bridge the connection but when i do vboxmanage guestproperty get "windows 8.1 pro" "/virtualbox/guestinfo/net/0/v4/ip" i get no value set! or value: 10.0.2.15
<earnestly>	sudokode: yeah
<hexhaxtron>	what can i do?
<escondida>	du -s /boot -> 33m
<hyo0301>	yes it is needed earnestly, else i can't do this http://puu.sh/hbe9j/e9fc62fd0d.png
<hyo0301>	thanks sudokode
<earnestly>	hyo0301: nope
<earnestly>	hyo0301: that error is entirely unrelated
<sudokode>	yeah, that's just a warning
<earnestly>	hyo0301: on gpt there is no post-mbr gap
<earnestly>	hyo0301: and grub needs somewhere to dump it's stage 1.5 core.img
<earnestly>	hyo0301: so you have to make one, give it type ef02
<earnestly>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bios_boot_partition
<phrik>	title: bios boot partition - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (at en.wikipedia.org)
<hyo0301>	oh god
<earnestly>	it helps if you read the messages :p
<earnestly>	and wiki the unknowns
<sudokode>	hyo0301: or if you don't need grub in this case, just use syslinux
<sudokode>	it can boot gpt from bios without that gap
<sudokode>	cause no extra shit to load
<diegoviola>	how do i record a video on wayland (gnome)
<earnestly>	well, grub also embeds the boot.img in the protective mbr, like syslinux
<earnestly>	grub just has a stage 1.5 which is kind of big
<diegoviola>	screen capture
<earnestly>	i.e. it's where all the fs drivers are
<sudokode>	right, because the mbr is too small
<sudokode>	bootloaders always do this
<sudokode>	because mbr
<sudokode>	they shove extra crap elsewhere when there's not enough room. that's mbr's fault
<dacoit>	bios boot partition fits pretty snugly before the 2048th sector
<diegoviola>	ugh... now that i remember i'm getting a t450, will i have problems with uefi
<diegoviola>	?
<hyo0301>	earnestly:  are you a computer scientisgt
<diegoviola>	or secure boot
<sudokode>	lol
<sudokode>	what, i don't strike you as the computer scientist type?
<dacoit>	no
<sudokode>	diegoviola: you can still boot in bios mode from uefi
<earnestly>	diegoviola: no problems
<diegoviola>	sudokode: oh, i'm just unfamiliar with uefi, sorry
<sudokode>	everyone is
<dacoit>	uefi is better, you'll find
<hyo0301>	anyway that wiki didn't help me earnestly, thanks for trying
<diegoviola>	earnestly: thanks :)
<earnestly>	better in some ways, horrific in others
<sudokode>	or you won't. most people just end up using gpt and thinking that's uefi
<sudokode>	cause it's one of the best things to come out of uefi
<sudokode>	and doesn't even need it
<diegoviola>	i've been using a t510 for 4 years and 2 months and some days
<earnestly>	ultimately uefi is worse, even if the ui is better
<poca>	diegoviola: thinkpad or whatever dell?
<sudokode>	no, uefi just isn't as standard as bios
<diegoviola>	poca: thinkpad
<sudokode>	because the uefi spec isn't as restrictive as it should be
<dacoit>	and then theres apple
<earnestly>	no, because uefi is an overengineered and overly complicated
<bolto>	i'm having problems updating my system
<sudokode>	it just defines things bios never did, so those things are now standard. but the overall implementation can be very vendor-specific
<earnestly>	piece of firmware
<bolto>	i run pacman -syyu, and it errors on:
<bolto>	error: failed to prepare transaction (could not satisfy dependencies)
<earnestly>	the mechanism used in bios is far simpler, coreboot is even better
<bolto>	:: lib32-cracklib: requires cracklib=2.9.1
<poca>	i bought a dell last year and i still regret it haha
<selby>	dell--
<bolto>	any idea what i can do?
<sudokode>	earnestly: well, bios is also standard because it's based off of a more tangible standard, i.e. ibm pc
<teraflop>	bolto: you have aur/lib32-cracklib ?
<bolto>	teraflop: yes
<earnestly>	sudokode: i'm talking more about the mechanism and less about the social stuff around it
<teraflop>	bolto: ^
<sudokode>	so any ibm pc-compatible system is able to boot via bios
<earnestly>	sudokode: all it did was jump to a fixed location and that was it
<bolto>	2 aur/lib32-cracklib 2.9.4-1 [installed: 2.9.1-1] (114)
<earnestly>	uefi defines an entire coff based binary format
<earnestly>	it's bigger than the kernel core
<earnestly>	when stuff like coreboots, i find it hard saying uefi is better.  sure the ui is, and dualboot is simpler than ever, but eeeh
<bolto>	wait nevermind, it was being an ass and wanted to be updated manually
<bolto>	my apologies
<teraflop>	bolto: ;)
<earnestly>	coreboot exists*
<sudokode>	earnestly: yeah that's fair
<bolto>	oh wow
<earnestly>	diegoviola: if you think about it a bit, uefi is much simpler to use, so that's nice.  you might have to turn off secure boot for a mchine that new
<bolto>	4.0.1-1-arch boots really fast
<teraflop>	heh
<teraflop>	bolto: why?
<earnestly>	or if you're feeling masochistic, you can try get the shim working and boot a signed kernel
<bolto>	idk
<bolto>	before it was pretty slow
<bolto>	now it's blazing fast!(tm)
<sudokode>	that's because of lfua.c
<diegoviola>	earnestly: i see
<sudokode>	brand new in 4.0
<bolto>	are you be serious or making fun at my expense ;_;
<sudokode>	it would've been funnier if you asked what lfua stands for
<bolto>	what does it stand for?
<sudokode>	light fire under ass
<bolto>	lamo
<sudokode>	i
<teraflop>	bolto: i didnt notice any speedup in my boot heh
<sudokode>	i'm still not on 4.0

<sudokode>	lol
<selby>	i should have known that, though. i've seen you or someone do it before
<ahop>	when i do it from udev,  it alwas says "not properly umounted, use fsck"
<ahop>	but when i do it myself from bash, it works
<ahop>	with the *same command*
<ahop>	i read somewhere we cann't use mount from udev rule...

<cyphix>	sudokode: here it is : http://sprunge.us/zfpi
<ahop>	ie unplugging, replugging should be possible
<sudokode>	so boring
<sudokode>	you still have to eject it before you unplug it
<ahop>	it's an embedded computer
<sudokode>	otherwise it could still be mounted

<ahop>	i probably did pacman -s autofs  15 times
<sudokode>	running it as root isn't the solution, so you might want to find the real problem
<selby>	oh, my bad

<selby>	yeah

<d_garbage>	i've been broke since forever, carrot cake is one of the many things i can only dream about :p
<micca>	ooh carrot and cheese cake nom nom nom! and of course, chocolate!
<diegoviola>	it's supposed to record my screen
<selby>	poor grooveshark, though, i didn't care too much for them
<cyphix>	sudokode: http://sprunge.us/chkh
<d_garbage>	carrots on the other hand, i'm only too familiar with
<micca>	haah d_garbage... that is seriously broke... but ye.. it's not as expensive to make as cheese cake !
<holomorph>	fruit cake… with rum
<teraflop>	diegoviola: it works ^
<sudokode>	cyphix: alright, well log completely out and log in as your user
<sudokode>	then startx
<dacoit>	d_garbage: i'm more of a stick guy
<micca>	also not a bad one holomorph :)
<diegoviola>	teraflop: it doesn't here
<fireboot>	earnestly: i understand what you meant now when you said it will suck to lose all my configs
<fireboot>	i just started my code editor
<fireboot>	i think i'm blind now
<selby>	omg
<hyo0301>	i can't do this http://puu.sh/hbe9j/e9fc62fd0d.png
<cyphix>	sudokode: hoho! it worked! could you explain what was the problem?
<micca>	you hosed your /etc?
<micca>	and/or your ~/.config?
<teraflop>	diegoviola: it works xd
<fireboot>	micca: ~/.config and its friends
<micca>	uff
<holomorph>	oh noes
<diegoviola>	teraflop: any ideas what i could be doing wrong?
<fireboot>	i had to. kde refused to start.
<fireboot>	so i had to nuke everything
<micca>	that doesn't sound very good lool.. why did you not make a a simple cp -ra {,.bak}?
<holomorph>	you could have mv'd it :|
<teraflop>	diegoviola: uhm, nope
<sudokode>	cyphix: root had the seat. you then logged in as your user on top of root, so even though your user is logged in, root still has the seat
<fireboot>	i was in a rush to get some work done
<fireboot>	and panicking
<holomorph>	lol
<sudokode>	so you can't grab the permissions from root
<micca>	that really doesn't sound like a reason: my kde won't start so hell, i will delete all my config files, not just the kde ones, and not keep a simple backup :p
<mrelendig>	fireboot: this is why you should use btrfs and regular snapshots
<fireboot>	i spent 2h trying to fix those issues
<holomorph>	panic mv > panic rm
<cyphix>	ah ok. you can only loggin with the 'primary' session then
<hyo0301>	looks like people here just gonna ignore me, what's the support channel to archlinux?
<selby>	this whole rebooting to get sound is not my style
<micca>	heheh holomorph  hear hear.
<sudokode>	pretty much
<d_garbage>	fireboot, if that happens again, consider creating a fresh user might be less painful
<fireboot>	mrelendig: btrfs has a bunch of other issues. in the long run i'm not sure as of now btrfs would have saved me time :)
<sudokode>	you could switch the tty and login as your user
<selby>	hyo0301: i thought you were dying
<mrelendig>	fireboot: a snapshot would have
<sudokode>	loginctl session-status would then give you the proper output and startx would work
<hyo0301>	i half-survived
<dacoit>	backups by any other name, would smell as sweet
<micca>	ou can also create a new user, temp, stat it up, and recover necessary files and so on
<selby>	hyo0301: this is the support channel
<fireboot>	yeah but the data corruption i'd have gotten 2 months later would have lost me much more time
<cyphix>	sudokode: ok i see. thanks you!
<hyo0301>	selby:  wow
<selby>	you can try #archlinux-offtopic
<micca>	if kde wouldn't start from new user, it's /etc you should look into
<hyo0301>	selby: but this is very on-topic
<selby>	hyo0301: what's your problem?
<teraflop>	diegoviola: you see the orange thing up to the rigth? http://a.pomf.se/noepux.webm
<fireboot>	micca: kde did start from another user
<hyo0301>	http://puu.sh/hbe9j/e9fc62fd0d.png
<micca>	aha
<fireboot>	but not with my regular user
<diegoviola>	teraflop: nope
<diegoviola>	"gnome features built-in screencast recording with the ctrl + shift + alt + r key combination. a red circle is displayed in the bottom right corner of the screen when the recording is in progress. after the recording is finished, a file named screencast from %d%u-%c.webm is saved in the videos directory. in order to use the screencast feature the gst plugins need to be installed."
<fireboot>	i started by removing ~/.config but that did not solve the problem
<fireboot>	so i panicked and came here.
<diegoviola>	perhaps i don't have the gstreamer plugin installed?
<diegoviola>	could that be the issue?
<n00balert>	fireboot: still eh...i think you might have permission issues
<fireboot>	yeah honestly i have no clue what happened
<d_garbage>	odd, because most kde configs until recently are under ~/.kde4
<selby>	hyo0301: do you have a boot paritition with the boot flag set?
<hyo0301>	selby:  any idea?
<fireboot>	d_garbage: i also removed .kde4
<hyo0301>	selby: nope.
<selby>	hyo0301: need to do that
<fireboot>	no clue why this directory keeps being created although i'm running kde5
<teraflop>	diegoviola: uhm maybe, i havent tested in gnome-wayland though, yo do gnome-wayland?
<teraflop>	you*
<d_garbage>	well, things are a bit awkward with this 4/5 transition
<diegoviola>	teraflop: i'm on gnome x now
<teraflop>	same as mee
<hyo0301>	earnestly and sudokode said i don't have to
<fireboot>	n00balert: i'd vote for something along the lines of what earnestly suggested
<hyo0301>	selby:
<n00balert>	which was?
<fireboot>	something fishy happened after i undocked my laptop from wokr
<fireboot>	work
<selby>	hyo0301:  make a parition that is 256 or 512 mib and set it +b
<fireboot>	i was getting a weird error in the xorg log about intel_backlight
<micca>	i am currenlty using a custom xsession, either a n openbox/awn/conky based one, or compiz.. was using nemo but mixing and mashing is a bit lame i realised so will prolly actually do an xfce on top of ob/compiz.
<fireboot>	that i'd not get with the new user
<n00balert>	hm yeah
<micca>	but with awn instead of the panel.
<hyo0301>	http://puu.sh/hbdtx/46b7b27fbd.png selby
<d_garbage>	i think they tried hard to make it better than 3/4 but the way they've done it doesn't really account for rolling release
<hyo0301>	how?
<hyo0301>	i don't have the +b
<n00balert>	fireboot: i often get 'backlight' warnings when booting after an update...but they go away
<fireboot>	anyway, it's fixed now
<selby>	hyo0301: try pressing b
<fireboot>	i just need to config kdevelop before i turn really blind
<n00balert>	it's fixed?
<hyo0301>	as if i haven't '-'
<n00balert>	nvm then :)
<fireboot>	well, the session started after removing .local/share/*
<selby>	hyo0301: it didn't ask you for flags when creating it?
<fireboot>	but now the combination of ugly code and ugly color scheme in kdevelop is killing me :p
<selby>	hyo0301: i am not familiar with that partitioning tool.  i just use parted
<n00balert>	osx is the prettiest...
<d_garbage>	andrea and rojas has done a great job dealing with it though i must add
<hyo0301>	selby: it's supposed to look like this http://puu.sh/hbe3f/5361a5d4f0.png
<n00balert>	and i'd run it as a vm if i could
<hyo0301>	but i didn't get that option
<selby>	hyo0301: well then use parted
<selby>	it can do it
<earnestly>	you don't need those flags, that is, bootloaders set them if needed
<hexhaxtron>	how can i fix this? http://sprunge.us/abla
<fireboot>	n00balert: a famous c++ dev said "mac os is an ok unix and a great desktop, linux is an ok desktop and a great unix". i think i couldn't agree less
<fireboot>	more****
<hyo0301>	selby: you mean cfdisk?
<n00balert>	he wasn't the first one to have said that i bet
<selby>	earnestly: it isn't working for him
<mrelendig>	gnu is not unix
<selby>	hyo0301: i mean parted
<mrelendig>	and linux is just a kernel
<micca>	well, i am asking myself if this is the right distro for you fireboot :)
<fireboot>	micca: why? :)
<dacoit>	dis_gon_b_gud.gif
<selby>	hyo0301: run `parted /dev/sd[whatever]` and then run `set 1 boot on`
<selby>	then quite
<n00balert>	and you don't have to be 'a famous c++ dev' to know it either :p
<selby>	quit*
<fireboot>	n00balert: fair enough
<d_garbage>	dunno about that. kde is a great desktop. can't really think of anything i need to do that it doesn't do
<selby>	d_garbage: i second that
<n00balert>	speaking of developers...there is only but one 'man' here; https://www.archlinux.org/people/developers/
<phrik>	title: arch linux - developers (at www.archlinux.org)
<fireboot>	micca: i do think as of now arch is the distribution i need. it has been for the last, hmm, many years
<selby>	i've been using kde since 3.2
<hyo0301>	selby:  "the flah 'boot' is not available for loop disk labels."
<fireboot>	i just don't want to end up fixing my de instead of getting work done
<micca>	well, just the way you do problem solving, might be a tad different from the way i'd say one does things. which might be because you are used to another distro.. i don't know. i probably missed out on what you have been doing in here.
<d_garbage>	for me it's the way you can configure it, i change a lot because i don't like the defaults
<fireboot>	and i couldn't care less about where kde stores its files
<selby>	hyo0301: `print` in parted
<micca>	well, if it's fixed, it's fixed hehe.
<n00balert>	d_garbage: kde would be my go to desktop after osx
<fireboot>	micca: well, i was under time pressure as well
<selby>	hyo0301: you might have to start over.
<hyo0301>	wow
<hyo0301>	no
<hyo0301>	way
<micca>	hmm, i always ended up being a gnome user, but that was up until g3.
<selby>	hyo0301: ???
<hyo0301>	selby: why print?
<fireboot>	i might have done things slightly differently if i had more time
<hyo0301>	it takes ages to install it
<fireboot>	and also, arch is the distribution i've used the longest
<selby>	hyo0301: to see your partition table
<selby>	hyo0301: `mklabel gpt`?
<selby>	but i think that will make you start over.
<micca>	i did try it on fedora some years ago, and it was working very nicely then, but ye.. i always found it very slow in general (for me). but kde always had nice programs too which gtk didn't have and so on.
<selby>	anyone know what a 'loop disk label' is and how hyo0301 made it?
<micca>	ye fireboot, i didn't mean anything definite by my comment. i simply missed out on what you had been doing thus far, and i simply though wow.. that's not good 'panic control' :p
<d_garbage>	the one thing that kde is not good at is documentation. it's so big and old now that its documentation is an absolute mess. thankfully a good gui shouldn't need much in the way of documentation, so it's just occasionally very frustrating.
<selby>	hyo0301: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/beginners'_guide#prepare_the_storage_devices
<phrik>	title: beginners' guide - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<micca>	selby , when you format the fs on the loop file, you can specify the label
<selby>	hyo0301: follow from there
<selby>	hmm
<micca>	ye, i can confirm i also have my issues here; i decided to bring in compiz for fun and also awn which wasn't woeking. so did some minor patching, things work great except for menus in awn.. so having a look at that and like you said, i lose time to do stuff i am supposed to do !
<selby>	well, hyo0301 i have no idea how to help you except to reccomend starting over.  unless someone else knows what's up
<d_garbage>	micca, 8x or 9x?
<diegoviola>	teraflop: i found the problem
<diegoviola>	teraflop: with the gnome recording
<diegoviola>	teraflop: lack of ~/videos directory, created, restarted gnome and now works
<micca>	hyo, you are in a partitin editor
<micca>	you won't set any labels there.
<micca>	you will set them when creating the fs
<spartan-s63>	so, i'm trying to set the hwclock to utc from arch linux, but arch wants to recognize the system clock as utc when it's actually set for local time. can i do this from arch or do i have to do it manually in the bios?
<hyo0301>	selby: it's ok thanks for the help
<d_garbage>	!give spartan-s63 wiki time
<phrik>	spartan-s63: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/time
<hyo0301>	selby: earnestly knows what's wrong but doesn't wanna spoonfeed
<spartan-s63>	d_garbage: i've looked at it and found nothing conclusive.
<d_garbage>	spartan-s63, what's setting it to local time?
<spartan-s63>	d_garbage: currently, the hardware clock is set to local time, but arch is interpreting it as utc and setting it back to my timezone (utc -0600). i want arch to interpret the hardware clock as local time, if possible, and then set the hardware clock to the proper utc time (again, if possible).
<spartan-s63>	d_garbage: i've tried the various hwclock commands and the timedatectl commands.
<spartan-s63>	d_garbage: perhaps i'm not understanding something correctly.
<fireboot>	micca: it's not too  bad actually, i realize i was running in a fairly stock configuration
<fireboot>	a few shortcuts, some virtual desktops
<fireboot>	etc etc
<fireboot>	but nothing dramatic
<grandpatrolling>	spartan-s63: /etc/localtime ?
<spartan-s63>	grandpatrolling: /etc/localtime is set to utc -0600
<grandpatrolling>	derp
<d_garbage>	spartan-s63, "i want arch to interpret the hardware clock as local time" you mean timezone?
<d_garbage>	use utc and set the timezone
<d_garbage>	then things should work automatically, including dst etc
<micca>	fireboot, you say you have used archlinux the longest.. how long is that?
<spartan-s63>	d_garbage: so change /etc/localtime to utc?
<hyo0301>	omfg
<d_garbage>	spartan-s63, i can't remember i set that up years ago, try readin the wiki again
<fireboot>	micca: very hard to tell honestly. i think it was something like 2010
<micca>	ok thats around same time as i started using arch
<micca>	i starte doff withg mandrake 2.something or what it was eons ago
<d_garbage>	yay mandrake
<fireboot>	i started linux with mandrake 10 community
<fireboot>	or 10.1
<grandpatrolling>	i started with knoppipx. derp.
<d_garbage>	having to change their name to 'mandriva' was one of linux's great comic tragedies
<cyphix>	when i try to log as root from my standard user with 'su -', i receive this message : "su:authentication service cannot retrieve authentication info". any idea why?
<fireboot>	spent some time on debian but i remember hating the community so i shifted away
<micca>	hehe.. ye, i liked it.. but uff,... back in those days, with early x.. and one bought an unknown brand laptop (read: erm oh shoot, i forgot.. the one starting with m.. in uk).. anywho, one had to specify verttical and horizontal refresh rates of the medion.. that's it! (o(....
<fireboot>	(in my country at least)
<d_garbage>	oneof the most unfortunate names ever, "man driver" i mean, what?
<grandpatrolling>	micca: i remember having to do that
<grandpatrolling>	it's simple
<micca>	lots of technical stuff whciohone couldn't just find, the internet was not that amaziong back then... anyway... i spent i think 3 months before i got x finally re-compiled and working for a medion laptop... ! these days, arch installs in 5 mins here from boot up, to format, to mount to idlland install x
<micca>	gotta love this new installer, so succint :x
<d_garbage>	i had a great time with mandrake/mandriva, was involved with their irc channel before comming here. in fact i switched to arch because of that
<fireboot>	there is a new installer?
<grandpatrolling>	Ò.ó did someone say new installer?
<homerj>	mandrake was pretty good
<micca>	well the one we have now yes.. 'new' it's prolly a year or two now of course.
<homerj>	that was back when distros were pretty de specific
<homerj>	they were one of the better kde based ones
<fireboot>	micca: ok
<d_garbage>	yeah
<fireboot>	i'm not sure i got to try it
<micca>	but i mean compared to the old one which was quite slow in comparison.
<fireboot>	i got this laptop in 2013 and haven't reinstalled since then
<homerj>	d_garbage, i found some old mandrake cds a while back
<hannibal_smith>	first linux distro...fedora core 2!
<d_garbage>	:)
<spartan-s63>	d_garbage: i figured it out. i don't remember the command order now, but i did figure it out. i have the hwclock set to utc and windows should read off of utc as well so nothing should get screwed up.
<diegoviola>	my first distro was winlinux 2000
<micca>	ye d_garbage : i liked mandrake haha, but back then dll hell broke it.. and i got introduced to the debian world via ubuntu, and well, dll hell had been vastly improoved by then, then arch came along and i have been sold since
<d_garbage>	i started with (well, after knoppix) suse/opensuse
<grandpatrolling>	lolnkoppix
<grandpatrolling>	fail~
<d_garbage>	another great bunch of people (oh, all right 'community' if you must) that got shafted by politics
<micca>	an actual unix machine back in 90s, unix v, but ye, solaris then at uni, and mandrake was my first. (also red hat at uni but preferred my mandrake)
<micca>	knoppoix fail? knoppox was great
<micca>	knoppix*
<grandpatrolling>	i used solaris
<fireboot>	micca: to go back to our previous conversation, when i was "younger" i used to love configuring systems, system administration etc. nowadays i really hate it, it needs to work the way i need it to
<fireboot>	and arch is pretty cool for this
<d_garbage>	no suse, not knoppix
<grandpatrolling>	my uncle gave me a machine when i was a wee lad
<micca>	i used it in between before i tried ubuntu 7.4 or or what it was called.
<micca>	fireboot, ye i agree.
<hannibal_smith>	at least for me, i remember slackware as a really good distro...i don't remember why i liked it so much
<diegoviola>	how do i get rid of coredumps in coredumpctl?
<grandpatrolling>	coreflush¿
<diegoviola>	no such thing
<grandpatrolling>	gotta flush after you take a dump
<fireboot>	so about my issue, i actually don't care about not knowing exactly what the problem was
<fireboot>	as long as it's "solved"
<d_garbage>	that's one of the best things about arch, it's not tied to a company, with all the inevitable bull that comes with that
<hannibal_smith>	micca, of solaris i always remember some screen with cde
<fireboot>	it's not being closed or simply minded, i just want my mind to be busy on something else than debugging my de :p
<micca>	sometimes i am sick of plonkering about, hell i even went back some months ago and installed ubuntu because for once, they had something we didn't have (updated packjages for hteir unpriv. lxc packages) still... didn't last more than 2 weeks before realising, there is more mayhem there with automagic opaque crap and coming back again.
<fireboot>	yeah same
<fireboot>	debian is pretty neat though
<hannibal_smith>	i remember when sun relased solaris 10, i wanted to try it because i was really curious about cde
<netz>	i just don't like the build system :<
<d_garbage>	and so... welcome to arch }:]
<netz>	pkgbuild spoiled me xd
<grandpatrolling>	!welcome4
<phrik>	welcome to arch linux. tell us how you fucked up.
<micca>	nets, you dont like ours?
<hannibal_smith>	thinking about it, now solaris don't even ship with cde anymore
<netz>	no, i don't like debian's. i love arch's :)
<homerj>	they open sourced it awhile back
<homerj>	cde
<hannibal_smith>	uhm i didn't know
<micca>	sometimes i can be tired of working up a pkgbuild, but ye.. then one is reminded of how many are pre-created of complex issues solved say.. and i bless the gods and daemons
<saivert>	motif theme
<d_garbage>	it's funny. arch is the linux distro where people 'end up'. whatever else they've used, if they use arch for any length of time they never switch again
<micca>	ah ye netz... it is a bit convoluted the deb build system, when one looks at all the extra goof one adds often toa project to make it debian build, but hey..
<fireboot>	do you guys actually often build custom packages?
<grandpatrolling>	d_garbage: it's either archlinux or freebsd for me <3
<micca>	i would imagine a ling time user of gentoo, might stick to it
<d_garbage>	indeed
<micca>	ye or *bsd's of course.
<keenerd>	fireboot: all the time.
<grandpatrolling>	my current machine doesn't do bsd :|
<fireboot>	keenerd: it doesn't count if you're a maintainer.
<micca>	i am assuming linuxes here gramps! :s
<hannibal_smith>	micca, i have really good memories of netbsd, not so much of freebsd
<micca>	:d*
<diegoviola>	i see no reason to use bsd rather than linux
<keenerd>	!grab fireboot
<d_garbage>	fireboot, i use linux-ck so i build the kernel all the time
<phrik>	keenerd: tada!
<homerj>	na, people that run gentoo get tired of it
<hannibal_smith>	on my hardware netbsd always felt more solid
<homerj>	it's a good idea in theory, not practice
<hyo0301>	archlinux installation is pure hedache
<micca>	that's the strcitest one , right? but also probably the technically speaking, most correct..?
<micca>	hyo lol
<grandpatrolling>	hyo0301: you need moar practice
<keenerd>	d_garbage: we have lost some people, but they still like to hang out here :-)
<d_garbage>	yes
<diegoviola>	i find ubuntu harder to install than arch (on btrfs)
<d_garbage>	exactly
<d1etyd3vil>	join #gaming
<d1etyd3vil>	oops
<hyo0301>	grandpatrolling: don't know what else i can do other than reading the wiki '-'
<fireboot>	d_garbage: there is no package in aur?
<grandpatrolling>	diegoviola: y no zfs
<hyo0301>	grandpatrolling: pretty much why i came here
<fireboot>	(for linux-ck)
<d_garbage>	like digitalkiwi uses mac's now but still pops in occasionaly
<d_garbage>	not recently though :(
<diegoviola>	grandpatrolling: it's not in the kernel, and i don't want to break my kernel when doing pacman -syu
<micca>	i have never come across a simpler installer: here let me summarise a n example in a vm say with a sda. boot, sudo -s; fdisk /dev/sda, n p 1 w, mount /dev/sda1 /mnt ; pacstrap base{,-devel} /mnt; done
<grandpatrolling>	hyo0301: read the instructions that are in directory after boot?
<grandpatrolling>	diegoviola: do not -syu then. derp :p
<diegoviola>	grandpatrolling: lol no thanks
<micca>	then genfstab -pu /mnt >> bla bla, arch-chroot, do your ln -s time
<hyo0301>	i've read it all grandpatrolling
<micca>	useradd; passwd
<micca>	bla bla 2 mins later full system
<grandpatrolling>	hyo0301: then you're all done
<d_garbage>	fireboot, ?
<diegoviola>	how to remove coredumps from coredumpctl?
<grandpatrolling>	coreflush¿
<diegoviola>	why doesn't coredumpctl allows me to remove them
<hyo0301>	grandpatrolling:  done with 500 errors
<d_garbage>	fireboot, i mean using the pkgbuild from the aur. there is a repo too but i like building it
<fireboot>	okay
<grandpatrolling>	hyo0301: what sort of errors?
<fireboot>	got a question for you guys
<diegoviola>	lame
<grandpatrolling>	hyo0301: internal server error? :d
<fireboot>	sometimes, typically when i have a lot of heavy tabs in chrome
<fireboot>	the system becomes unusable
<micca>	i have a quick line so i have a full new fresh system in about 5 mins after i boot the first time, that incudes all the config files editing like locales, time, fstab, thanks to the great and sime install scripts. you are not used to them on the first time, but if you don't get it by the second time either, you are in the wrong place hyo0301
<grandpatrolling>	fireboot: out of memories¿
<fireboot>	i disabled swap altogether because i thought the problem was swapping
<micca>	diagovola, uncomment in /etc/systemd/coresomething.conf
<micca>	storage=none
<d_garbage>	!give fireboot chromium2
<micca>	if you don't want the coredumps to amass
<phrik>	fireboot: http://i.imgur.com/4lpvkts.gif
<fireboot>	i expected that by disabling swap the oom manager would wake up much earlier
<fireboot>	but apparently not
<fireboot>	so i'm not sure what's actually happening
<micca>	fireboot,
<micca>	chromium is a horrid memory leaker with many tabs..
<micca>	flash plugin rather
<fireboot>	oh, yes, that i know
<hyo0301>	micca:  thtat was harsh
<fireboot>	but that was not the point. that could happen with any program using too much memory
<fireboot>	which happens quite often with what i do at work
<hyo0301>	grandpatrolling: the bootloader errors m8
<micca>	not harsh, but factual hyo. you will get ot understanm dit easily and if you don't , you are in the wrong place. :)
<grandpatrolling>	hyo0301: any specifics?
<micca>	well, disabling swap won't help you, because then you just will avoid the swapping when it starts, but your tabs will obviously crash faster ,p
<fireboot>	well i don't mind the tabs crashing micca
<fireboot>	what i mind is the machine becoming completely unusable and requiring a hard reboot
<micca>	ah
<grandpatrolling>	fireboot: hard drive thrashing?
<d_garbage>	!give fireboot sysrq
<phrik>	fireboot: send commands directly to the kernel: https://www.kernel.org/doc/documentation/sysrq.txt
<micca>	ye.. welcome to the new world of spying.. becore 'cdn' back in the day i coul dhave on a 4 yr old laptop in 2006 hundreds up to 600 webpages open
<d_garbage>	every time i hear the term 'hard reboot' i cringe
<micca>	now, on a superior computer by far, it can't really keep up with that..
<hyo0301>	http://puu.sh/hbdtx/46b7b27fbd.png grandpatrolling
<grandpatrolling>	omg my eyes
<holomorph>	lol
<grandpatrolling>	hyo0301: ¿
<fireboot>	that's pretty cool d_garbage, i didn't know sysrq
<grandpatrolling>	i see nothing wrong there
<fireboot>	yeah maybe hard drive trashing
<fireboot>	but why would chrome start to do too much i/o?
<fireboot>	it's a web browser
<grandpatrolling>	fireboot: check out inotify. use it to monitor your homedir for file reads/writes
<d_garbage>	fireboot, it's very good to know. arch has only 'sync' permission by default, so you'll need to set it up
<micca>	if you have swap, and you get the omg omg omg , the computer is grinding to a halt, fireboot : you will need to quickly do a term or alt + f2, and kill chromium. then restart it but that'snot a good approach. if at work, you should realise how many tabs you can have open,
<bfrizzle>	hey, did i miss some kind of obsoletion package having to do with module blacklisting? the nvidia package installed a conf file with a nouveau blacklist in /usr/lib/modprobe.d, but in order to actually blacklist nouveau, i had to copy it to /etc/modprobe.d - any reason?
<micca>	more or less, and surely you don't need that man open at work.. use firefox? is a bit better. get a flash plugin controller, which only runs flash you set it to run..
<fireboot>	actually micca on kde there is a shortcut
<fireboot>	ctrl+alt+escape
<fireboot>	turns the cursor into a pirate skull
<fireboot>	and kills anything you click on
<d_garbage>	using a memory monitor is handy for catching things like that. i have one on the panel
<grandpatrolling>	fireboot: check out zramswap for faster swappage
<micca>	bfrizzle, mkinitcpio.conf i think pulls in only from /etc/ dirs
<fireboot>	i don't know what signal exactly they send but it's not one of the nice ones :p
<grandpatrolling>	pirate signal
<grandpatrolling>	arrrgh
<micca>	i used zramswap in the past but didn't realyl feel it did much .. dunno.. am equaslly happy without it.
<grandpatrolling>	zramswap made my system loads more responsive
<fireboot>	micca: like i said the problem is not only with chrome
<micca>	;you use chrome? :o
<fireboot>	chrome is the obvious example
<micca>	or chromium?
<fireboot>	chromium i mean
<d_garbage>	i rarely keep lots of tabs open or indeed the browser itself, even when using opera wich is (was i guess) much better at that
<micca>	chrome will have different libs than chromium in it
<d_garbage>	which*
<hyo0301>	http://puu.sh/hbe9j/e9fc62fd0d.png grandpatrolling  wrong link
<grandpatrolling>	i use teh chrome
<hyo0301>	that is the problem ^
<d_garbage>	bookmarks are a thing :p
<micca>	ye d_garbage, or just bind the xkill to a key, sat meta + q
<micca>	:p
<grandpatrolling>	hyo0301: yer doin it wrong
<d_garbage>	just don't leave the broswer open, simple
<fireboot>	i usually use my browser as a lifo
<d_garbage>	!g lifo
<phrik>	d_garbage: fifo and lifo accounting - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fifo_and_lifo_accounting>
<grandpatrolling>	what is a lifo? is that like yolo
<grandpatrolling>	oh, i know fifo
<d_garbage>	!g computing lifo
<phrik>	d_garbage: last-in first-out (lifo) method | example | inventory valuation: <http://accountingexplained.com/financial/inventories/lifo-method>
<fireboot>	typically by the end of the day i have emptied the stack and i go to practice.
<d1etyd3vil>	accounting?
<micca>	d_garbage, at this moment, i have chat, about 6 firefox windows with hmm, 400 tabs open... and 40 geany docs .. transmission, couple of terms, a netflix like tv thing, and i since yest played again a bit cs 1.6 lol such nostalgia but now on 1920 instead of 800x600
<d1etyd3vil>	last in first out
<d_garbage>	ugh!
<d1etyd3vil>	first in first out
<d_garbage>	400 tabs? seriously?
<d1etyd3vil>	oh phrik beat me to it...
<micca>	all without any memory issues, no swap and no zramswap.. however i am on the openbox .. compiz is not bad either after i fixed 'bugs' but
<micca>	ye prolly...
<holomorph>	one tab
<d_garbage>	not my way of doing things at all heh
<pablotron>	three
<d_garbage>	sounds completely insane to me :p
<micca>	i know.. i am a very messy head.. and keep getting distracted into new topics and i keep them open till i have read them all so i don't forget em.,
<fireboot>	there is a workaround actually for my problem. i got to talk about it with a kernel dev at a conference
<micca>	yes, i am completely insane! :p
<grandpatrolling>	i think i have ~40 tabs open. i just counted halfway and multiplied by 2
<fireboot>	i could set a cgroups and put chromium into it
<fireboot>	and limit the memory it can use
<holomorph>	on the other hand, emacs buffers…
<micca>	that's good enough for a geometric average i guess :lp
<grandpatrolling>	:]
<micca>	you could fireboot and you should
<d_garbage>	micca, why tabs open rather than bookmarks? how on earth to you manage them, find anything?
<micca>	in fact, if you have that issue and at work.. i don't get it that muych now simply because i avoid the 600 tab treks
<geomyidae_>	so, libvirtd won't access my storage pool contents. despite the fact that the contents are 0777, it still can't access them.
<geomyidae_>	i'm guessing this is because there needs to be executable bit set on all parent directories up to the / too
<geomyidae_>	but how am i supposed to do that when /run/media/<user> has the execute bit un-set ?
<grandpatrolling>	i remember i once tried swap over network... wifi, to be exact. derp.
<d_garbage>	ouch
<grandpatrolling>	it did work fine... until it started swapping
<micca>	haha
<micca>	that machine must have been hard booted in the end...
<micca>	but come on.. how slow aren't think clients on massive places like campuses and so on
<micca>	thin*
<grandpatrolling>	i waited it out
<grandpatrolling>	it only took 3-4 hours
<grandpatrolling>	needed the swap for tmpfs... for a kernel compile
<grandpatrolling>	it should've taken ~40 minues
<micca>	actually, i was dl something yest.. forgot what it was and it filled up my tmp :*(((( blah and it was slooow dl. form the aur. some game i think i wanted ot try.. (been in nostalgia mode since this weekend)
<grandpatrolling>	one of my desktops has a 24gb tmpfs. i love power outages :|
<grandpatrolling>	i download all my stuff into it
<micca>	oh that's sweet
<grandpatrolling>	no ups = not sweet xd
<micca>	i have such a shoddy rammage now :( 8 gb
<micca>	i was gonna grab 32 gigs here some weeks ago but deal went off.
<micca>	so im stuck still with good ol 8 :d
<crazedpsyc>	get yoself some ups, man
<grandpatrolling>	8 is more than enough :p
<d_garbage>	4gb here, think yourself lucky :p
<micca>	hehe garb
<grandpatrolling>	i have 4gb on my current desktop
<d_garbage>	mind you i rarely use all of that.. .must be those tabs :p
<micca>	ye well i am happy with it.. but i dunno, then again 16 would certainly be so sweet, with the extra 6 say as a pure scratchdir
<hyo0301>	grandpatrolling: what' the command to install syslinux?
<crazedpsyc>	it's nice being able to assign 8g to vms
<grandpatrolling>	hyo0301: i suppose it's... syslinux
<hyo0301>	grub is, arch-chroot /mnt
<hyo0301>	.-.
<d_garbage>	yeah i don't use vm's much but obviously they are hungry
<micca>	ye.. i run at most 4 vm's but no more than 4 gb total
<crazedpsyc>	hyo0301: pacman -s, or syslinux_install-update -i (-a -m)
<hyo0301>	._.
<hyo0301>	oh thanks crazedpsyc
<micca>	but when i have my 400 tabs open, i only open max 1.5 gb worth of vm;s :p
<crazedpsyc>	-install_update, rather, hyo0301
<crazedpsyc>	mixing up my lines
<micca>	perm denied on what?
<micca>	sounds like sudo? :p
<geomyidae_>	libvirt storage pool contents.
<grandpatrolling>	on my current system i have a 4gb tmpfs backed by 4.8gb zram swap backed by 4gb of physical memory. spot any fails? xd
<micca>	oh
<grandpatrolling>	(it works fine for kernel compiles though)
<micca>	how many monitors do ppl have
<micca>	and d_garbage : are you on a laptop?
<grandpatrolling>	i have 1. but i've had up to 3 before
<micca>	oh laptops? oh god ive had so many i dont know how many.. prolly 8-10
<micca>	i have 2 now, which were old timers broken, one i chucked in the oven to fix it
<grandpatrolling>	oh, monitors :p
<micca>	the other one, i just did some houdou, but it's from 1874, an amd turion  :p
<d_garbage>	pc
<grandpatrolling>	i've only had 2 laptops in my life
<micca>	but i am not using that except for some programming when in bed :)
<grandpatrolling>	my latest one is a netbook with a 2 year uptime
<micca>	aha d_garbage ok good stuff..
<shanemikel>	can y'all help me figure what i need to get my webcam working?
<fireboot>	micca: at home i usually just plug my tv
<fireboot>	at work i have 2 external screens + the laptop screen
<grandpatrolling>	shanemikel: it's more fun to figure it out yourself. then...
<grandpatrolling>	!give shanemikel welcome4
<phrik>	shanemikel: welcome to arch linux. tell us how you fucked up.
<micca>	ye i use a 24 inch 'tv' or 26? 24 i think as my main monitor and have an old crt lol as well, as i sold my 2nd monitor a lil while ago..
<micca>	haha phrik <3
<fireboot>	46" micca :d
<micca>	that's how i would say things.
<micca>	oh nice
<shanemikel>	well it's a good thing i'm not looking for fun then
<grandpatrolling>	i have a 65" :|
<grandpatrolling>	very ghosty.
<fireboot>	i got a wireless keyboard/mouse
<micca>	jesus..
<fireboot>	with a kind of "pillow"
<crazedpsyc>	but is that a tv or a monitor, grandpatrolling?
<fireboot>	so i use that from my couch
<grandpatrolling>	it's a tv... monitor :p
<shanemikel>	i know that other distro's ive installed on this laptop have picked it up oob
<d1etyd3vil>	i'm gonna get drunk tonight.
<crazedpsyc>	probably not impressive resolution then, eh
<d1etyd3vil>	mondays suck.
<fireboot>	and i use the window shield on my right for my whisky glass
<grandpatrolling>	4k
<shanemikel>	is there a generic driver for webcam's that usually works like mesa is to video?
<fireboot>	see it's all very well thought.
<crazedpsyc>	i want a 60" with actually high pixel density
<micca>	garbage, where are you from?
<earnestly>	!dpi 3800 2600 65
<phrik>	earnestly: 70.83608881982362
<crazedpsyc>	apple has 5k screens for your pockets, i want fucking 10k for my monitor
<earnestly>	lol
<micca>	ye i wouldn't say no to a 40 or 65 but if you try any games on that.. how is that?
<crazedpsyc>	probably great if you sit far away
<crazedpsyc>	but then, what's the point of having it big?
<fireboot>	gaming on 46" is great
<micca>	im blind as a bat, i need to sit close
<grandpatrolling>	get one of them curved screens and have it right up to your nose? >:d
<micca>	like d_garbage noticed, im pretty insane, so i literally am one of those who has glasses which are half brtoken, where one side is kept up with rubber bands
<fireboot>	micca: at work one of my screens is flipped 90°
<d_garbage>	heh
<crazedpsyc>	get one of them vr headsets and have your screen all around you
<fireboot>	which has literally changed my life
<crazedpsyc>	better than curved
<d_garbage>	insane for me, i said :)
<homerj>	real nerds get lasik
<homerj>	i mean, shooting lasers into your eye
<grandpatrolling>	crazedpsyc: that's what she said ?
<homerj>	that's not the future, that's now
<crazedpsyc>	damn right it is
<micca>	kinda thing.. i got 3 pairs last year, i broke the first pair same night as i fell asleep on them, then got new ones luckily as i blagged the story, for breakling them... lost one of them though as i returned from shop... second i kept for some weeks till i sat on them on the veranda, and the last couple finally gave out some few months ago, withby then, rubber badns and broken and glued wity superglue,
<micca>	couldnt show myself in public with them, had ot rather walk into stuff :p got some lenses now but meh
<micca>	ye i also use(d) the 90 deg turn sometimes in a lab i was working at
<fireboot>	all websites become suddenly usable
<grandpatrolling>	no moar lines that stretch off to infinity?
<crazedpsyc>	heh, yeah, my 27" is nice vertically
<grandpatrolling>	i3-wm. split horizontally >:d
<crazedpsyc>	some stupid sites take that as an invitation to zoom out and keep the excess horizontal padding
<grandpatrolling>	:|
<d_garbage>	most web sites are terrible
<micca>	poor hyo, i think he has spent more time on trying to format a usb? than it takes to install arch 400 times :p
<fireboot>	bbc is an example of a website that become suddenly usable with a screen set vertically
<micca>	grandpatrolling> no moar lines that stretch off to infinity? <-- is that perhaps an effect of having large monitors? i don't have much issues with any such things.
<crazedpsyc>	yes, yes it is.
<micca>	the reaosn for my deg back then was for putting screens together :p
<crazedpsyc>	the best setup i've seen was a bunch of big vertical monitors set up next to each other, curving around a little bit
<crazedpsyc>	good use of space
<crazedpsyc>	https://twistedsifter.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/five-portrait-vertical-monitor-battlestation-computer-setup-1.jpg only not so dull
<micca>	is that skyrim?
<crazedpsyc>	probably
<fireboot>	looks like oblivion
<fireboot>	or no it's skyrim i think
<micca>	no it's skyrim
<crazedpsyc>	i've never seen any of those, so totes clue less
<micca>	i tried oblivion and skyrim this year, after i got an old 560 ti ftom someone
<d_garbage>	that's some setup
<fireboot>	i thought one of the icon in the top bar was the oblivion logo before i zoomed in.
<micca>	and wow, was pretty funky, for someone who only pld cs 1.6 maybe 2 yrs ago for a month and nothing before that for yrs.. except civ 5 :p
<fireboot>	yeah
<fireboot>	i built a gaming pc recently
<fireboot>	plugged to the tv of course
<d_garbage>	how often is your desk that clean though? }:]
<micca>	lol d_garbage
<micca>	<3
<micca>	you ar emy kinda guy!
<fireboot>	so i get to play skyrim on the big tv, it's pretty sweat
<fireboot>	sweet
<fireboot>	not sweat
<fireboot>	well i guess it's sweat too.
<micca>	agreed, right now, my desktop as in desk top is riddled with papers and broken hard disks as it were.
<d_garbage>	the backlight it a good idea, i do the same in a more modest fashion with an anglepoise lamp, makes a big difference on eye strain
<fireboot>	d_garbage: do you use redshift?
<micca>	i run so fast i get blueshift!
<d_garbage>	no, but i do tweak my gamma setting
<fireboot>	it's very nice to reduce eye strain

<micca>	of is dat alleen een coincidence? lol.... mijn nl is niet goed.
<al2o3-cr>	what to install to enable sound?
<pablotron>	ears
<al2o3-cr>	alsa-mixer isn't there
<micca>	pulseaudio and/or alsa
<holomorph>	!give al2o3-cr pkgfile
<phrik>	al2o3-cr: pkgfile is a tool to find out what package owns a file, even if said package is not installed. pacman -s pkgfile; pkgfile -u
<holomorph>	and it's alsamixer
<micca>	alias pacs='sudo pacman -ss'; pacs pulse
<micca>	pacs alsa etc
<holomorph>	you don't need sudo to search
<micca>	true
<al2o3-cr>	ah cool :)
<micca>	just typed it out without thinking :p
<micca>	don't think you need it for q either
<micca>	qo, ql, is fine without sudo
<al2o3-cr>	right i installed pulseaudio
<al2o3-cr>	how to make it start at boot
<micca>	you need a backend driver too like alsa.. pulse was actually not a good proposal as such, if you wish to keep it more minimal.
<micca>	look up pulseaudio on the wiki
<d_garbage>	al2o3-cr, it starts when things ask for it
<pablotron>	i'm sure mame support is good
<al2o3-cr>	d_garbage: oh ok
<diegoviola>	i tried to emulate mame once, it was an horrible experience
<al2o3-cr>	ok micca thank you
<coolthingy500>	what about alsa mixer?
<al2o3-cr>	ive got that too
<d_garbage>	pavucontrol
<diegoviola>	any ideas how to remove core dumps in coredumpctl?
<micca>	ye pulse + alsa, then check with aolsamixer if.. i mean just look up the two wiki pages, alsa and pulse, and everything should work fine.
<diegoviola>	there are coredumps for programs i don't even have installed anymore
<micca>	diego i told you
<micca>	hmm, i am looking for the file... still, there is aa conf file
<micca>	just edit it and change storage=none
<escondida>	diegoviola: man coredump.conf
<micca>	restart systemd- wait let me check .. i did this just 2 days ago :p
<al2o3-cr>	ok seems like gnome-alsamixer && pavucontrol both work fine thanks :)
<micca>	np
<al2o3-cr>	:)
<diegoviola>	storage=none will disable binary logging
<diegoviola>	i don't want that
<diegoviola>	just want to get rid of the current dumps
<micca>	no no
<micca>	not in journald.conf
<micca>	in coredump.conf or what it is..
<micca>	the coredumps are dropped in /var/somewhere iirc
<diegoviola>	are they not in the journal?
<micca>	by disanbling it and restarting service they will get removed in a sane manner
<micca>	no, they are not
<micca>	they are just sent there by default , by that conf file
<escondida>	diegoviola: if only there were some sort of...manual page...that had all these answers and more
<micca>	man coredump.conf
<micca>	lol escondida
<micca>	,)
<micca>	ye, ppl don't use man enough
<phreakachu>	man pages know most things
<phreakachu>	google knows the rest
<micca>	restart systemd-coredumpd
<micca>	they are sent to journal but the *actual*  coredumps are stored in erm, can't recall but it's in var/somewhere :p
<micca>	sorry, the default is not to send to journal, but to list them there. i kinda stated it differently i think but meant that. anywho.. off to relax x
<witquicked>	new install of nfs-utils - nfs-server and rpc-statd won't start. start rpcbind.service and everything is happily started

<witquicked>	i am running 219-6 systemd, but i hadn't even gotten to the point where i was trying to mount anything, let alone at boot

<witquicked>	from the last comment in fs#43647, "rpcbind-less nfsv4 only setup isn't the default recommended way currently"
<holomorph>	sheesh, yet another json thing https://github.com/andrewguenther/jsonf
<phrik>	title: andrewguenther/jsonf · github (at github.com)
<holomorph>	thank keenerd for jshon
<escondida>	holomorph: some people hear of a thing, and rather than looking for working libraries, immediately implement their own. in this way, maximum incompatibility between projects can be assured.
<devinmcelheran>	what is the best way to upgrade my kernel to 4.0? is it recommended at this point?
<dacoit>	-syu
<dacoit>	it's stable, yeah
<devinmcelheran>	i have -syu'ed, but i'm still on 3.19
<dacoit>	Õ_o really ?
<dacoit>	pacman -q linux ?
<holomorph>	then chances are your mirror is out of date
<devinmcelheran>	hah, i'm a noob, i guess i haven't rebooted in longer than i thought.
<holomorph>	escondida: i was tempted to leave a comment, but $site runs on invites. lame
<devinmcelheran>	thanks guys.
<escondida>	devinmcelheran: the version bump to the 4.0 series is largely cosmetic. linus torvalds just got bored of the leading 3 (no, really: http://kernelnewbies.org/linux_4.0%20#head-f1e69656d8d81838fb11479d5310556c738a311e )

<shanemikel>	d_garbage: you know anything about hardware installation?
<ginseng>	hi ever since i switched to arch my network-manager often is connected to the tun0 interface even tho im not using ssh or anything? any ideas what this could be? thx
<diegoviola>	i've removed the coredumps in /usr/lib/systemd/coredump but they still show up in coredumpctl
<aelius>	what is the difference between sleep.target and suspend.target?
<shanemikel>	lol!!!
<braindamage>	ram vs disk
<braindamage>	also, goooooogle
<shanemikel>	!google asshole
<phrik>	shanemikel: the no asshole rule: building a civilized workplace and surviving ...: <http://www.amazon.com/the-asshole-rule-civilized-workplace/dp/0446698202>
<shanemikel>	oh.. thought i would come up for a second
<aelius>	disk is hibernatebut thats wrong
<aelius>	suspend is suspend to ram, hibernate is suspend to disk
<escondida>	aelius: according to systemd.special(7), suspend.target and a few other things pull in sleep.target. so you'd use sleep.target to set anything you wanted to run for any suspend, hibernate, etc.
<shanemikel>	and hybrid-sleep is both!
<aelius>	escondida: ok, that brings me to another issue: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd/services#slock wants to use sleep.target, but it does not work unless i use suspend.target
<phrik>	title: systemd/services - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<aelius>	suspend.target works, but only launches slock after the laptop wakes up
<diegoviola>	i remember asking my friend can linux play videos in ~2000
<diegoviola>	lol
<selby>	whats a linux
<coolthingy500>	sound's alien to me.
<diegoviola>	playing videos with mplayer -vo x11 and -zoom on my sis video card was amazing
<coolthingy500>	like alien 2 (talking like a dumb teen girl)
<diegoviola>	even though it was slow as hell
<diegoviola>	linux is no longer the obscure system it used to be, where's the fun now?
<diegoviola>	i remember reading magazines where they suggested pizza and coffee and a night of no sleep to install it
<utack>	how was that feature called to set certain app priorities and rights. for example give a certain app only a certain amount of ram and so on
<diegoviola>	so boring now, everything just works
<escondida>	!grab diegoviola
<phrik>	escondida: tada!
<utack>	found it..cgroups
<utack>	thanks google
<devgrohl>	i remember saying "i wont install ubuntu, it's too hard"
<utack>	devgrohl these days it is harder to install windows 8, without a installation disc and all the options you have to set to be somewhat tracking free
<albertocg>	hello
<albertocg>	just started using arch and installed weechat. how do i switch channels >.<

<lysanderakili>	led_class              16384  2 xpad,steamos_xpad
<lysanderakili>	as you see, it's still in the system, even i did uninstall steamos_xpad
<holomorph>	and your question has been answered twice
<charlesatum>	wait, how did i think scissors instead of knives?
<lysanderakili>	how so?
<holomorph>	let me read irc for you:
<holomorph>	23:39 holomorph i'm gonna wildly guess modprobe(8)
<holomorph>	23:41 escondida lysanderakili: community/xpad is a sticky note program. to unload a kernal module, you want to use modprobe(8)
<lysanderakili>	modprove is a vague answer
<holomorph>	it's a nice way of telling you to read the fucking manual
<dacoit>	if only there was a utility to gain more info
<lysanderakili>	why would i modprobe a non existence package?
<holomorph>	!bailing
<phrik>	http://i.minus.com/ibvbat090xhxu1.gif
<escondida>	lysanderakili: the (8) following it indicates "if you're now sure how to use this, skim/search the manual"
<escondida>	lysanderakili: it's still loaded in your kernel.
<escondida>	lysanderakili: also, re: the xpad devs and the name, it's x(11) + (note)pad and probably predates "xpad" as a term for "gamepad"
<ahtapot>	hey how can i change the font size in terminal--the ctrl alt f1 ones-- there is no /etc/vconsole.conf
<escondida>	ahtapot: create the file. you can see its syntax in vconsole.conf(5)
<ahtapot>	allright thanks
<escondida>	ahtapot: for this session, see setfont(8)
<charlesatum>	never undertood those number on man page, any explanation for it?
<holomorph>	"if a font has more than 256 glyphs, only 8 out of 16 colors can be used simultaneously" lol
<holomorph>	charlesatum: "section"
<dacoit>	man man ;d
<holomorph>	^
<charlesatum>	oh, useful
<holomorph>	for instance, there are four sections for "printf"
<jasabella>	hi :)
<charlesatum>	hi
<jasabella>	the base group includes linux-f5r0ware s6 0y 5nte3 w5f5 card sh643d be 4sab3e after 5nsta335ng 5t c6rrect

<dusty`>	hello
<charlesatum>	trying to decode
<charlesatum>	linux-firmware, i think yes, let me check
<dusty`>	does anyone know how to start gvfs with a wm? it starts automatically with xfce4
<jasabella>	sorry
<jasabella>	had numlock on
<jasabella>	linux-firmware is in the base group so wifi should work after installing it)
<charlesatum>	i would like to know what model of keyboard is that.
<holomorph>	i imagine things that use it can automagically start it over dbus, but that's just a guess
<dacoit>	it does
<charlesatum>	anyway, iirc some wifi cards require installing their own drivers from other packages
<charlesatum>	(broadcom, i think)
<ahtapot>	escondida: is it possible to learn whats my keymap now by default for tty?
<jasabella>	ahhh
<escondida>	ahtapot: localectl
<jasabella>	charlesatum: that's what i'm worried about
<ahtapot>	damn.. all n/a for me
<holomorph>	vc keymap: emacs \o/
<jasabella>	i'm a little confused
<escondida>	ahtapot: so your locale is probably defaulting to c and your keymap to en
<scimmia>	jasabella, what card do you have?
<jasabella>	it's a 6205n
<jasabella>	intel taylor peak
<jasabella>	i'm not sure if i got firmware installed or driver installed or both
<sudokode>	6205n is a lot of... force...
<scimmia>	an intel card shouldn't be an issue
<homerj>	what is 6205n in real units?
<sudokode>	"real" units
<sudokode>	is that a thing?
<scimmia>	yep, looks like it uses iwlwifi
<dacoit>	bout 1.3k lbs
<scimmia>	and the firmware is part of linux-firmware
<sudokode>	!math convert 6205 n kgms2
<sudokode>	nope
<scimmia>	jasabella, so it should just work
<sudokode>	i doubt python has anything for that
<ph0x>	you cant convert newtons to "real units"
<ph0x>	according to wolfram alpha
<sudokode>	anyway, that's 6205 kg*m/s^2
<dacoit>	pounds, i did it for you
<holomorph>	yo u gots 2 divide by gravity frst
<jasabella>	great
<sudokode>	or 6,205 kg accelerating at 1 m/s every second
<escondida>	ph0x: and you're prepared to trust something named for not one but *two* joss whedon villains?
<sudokode>	in other words, get the fuck outta the way
<ph0x>	its ~1400 ft lbs
<ph0x>	wolfram is a mineral
<sudokode>	ft-lbs is even more fucking confusing
<dacoit>	thats torque
<charlesatum>	now how much is that compared to a elephant
<holomorph>	!yt koffee brown after party
<phrik>	holomorph: koffee brown - after party - youtube: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihj4ci7y-o>
<ph0x>	its a measurment of force
<sudokode>	yeah and it's weird
<jasabella>	i dont need a ram disk :d
<ph0x>	of work done
<ph0x>	feet / lbs?
<sudokode>	no
<sudokode>	foot-lbs
<sudokode>	feet*lbs
<dacoit>	force at a distance is torque
<ph0x>	m/2 * v^2 = ft / lbs
<sudokode>	it can't be ft/lb
<holomorph>	w = (f, d) bros
<scimmia>	but we're not talking nm, we're talking n
<jasabella>	i put down more force than an elephant when i'm wearing stilettos :d
<ph0x>	the foot-pound force (symbol: ft·lbf or ft·lbf), or simply foot-pound (symbol: ft·lb) is a unit of work or energy in the engineering and gravitational systems in united states customary and imperial units of measure. it is the energy transferred on applying a force of one pound-force (lbf) through a displacement of one foot. the corresponding si unit is the joule.
<sudokode>	yeah
<dacoit>	poor you
<dacoit>	i wear crocs
<sudokode>	anyway
<holomorph>	lol
<sudokode>	back to the real units
<ph0x>	metric units include the "glug" in the centimetre-gram-second system, and the "mug", "par", or "mte" in the metre-kilogram-second system.[12]
<ph0x>	also metric units are the real units
<dacoit>	the time deriv of acceleration is what, "jerk" ?
<dacoit>	or lurch
<dacoit>	something silly like that
<sudokode>	ph0x: well, lets not get ahead of ourselves
<charlesatum>	brunch
<traverseda>	so i've been running the same arch install on / for like 4 or 5 years. it's full of old cruft and crap. is there any tools that will help me sort through what to actually keep?

<traverseda>	holomorph, yes. obviously. not super useful when i'm dealing with groups and the like. i'll look through the tips though.
<jasabella>	i dont need a ram disk
<holomorph>	the tips are probably much more useful :p
<pablotron>	the rosetta was helpful
<dacoit>	-qt π
<jasabella>	time for the big test
<traverseda>	holomorph, definitely. pacgraph looks like pretty much exactly what i'm looking for. and there's a super useful expac command that only lists explicitly installed packages. that'll do nicely. thanks
<traverseda>	i was worried i'd have to python it out
<holomorph>	yeah pacgraph is cool. haven't looked at my pacgraph in a while
<holomorph>	texlive-fontsextra still king of the hill

<diegoviola>	how do you guys manage your ssh-agent? it's a pain to do it manually every time (run the ssh-agent) every time, i want to do it one time and forget
<callipygous>	whenever i resume from suspend, and switch to a tty i get this error spammed:  [  386.003409] ehci-pci 0000:00:1d.0: port 2 resume error -19.  anybody know how to fix this?
<diegoviola>	i have to eval $(ssh-agent) every time and export ssh_auth_sock, etc
<sudokode>	what's an ssh-agent?
<dacoit>	o\
<dacoit>	i think you invented that one
<sudokode>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfyaj1k9uzm
<sudokode>	finally. the fight we've all been waiting for

<junka>	sudokode; check your pm
<sudokode>	holy shit

<sudokode>	look at that
<sudokode>	ecology?
<sudokode>	why?
<sudokode>	i don't like animals
<dacoit>	sudokode: jesus christ
<sudokode>	dacoit: that's fucking terrifying, right?
<dacoit>	yeah, goddamn o_o
<sudokode>	alright, fine i'll bite
<sudokode>	join ##ecology
<sudokode>	er
<callipygous>	whenever i resume from suspend, and switch to a tty i get this error spammed:  [  386.003409] ehci-pci 0000:00:1d.0: port 2 resume error -19.  anybody know how to fix this?
<sudokode>	what's broken?
<dacoit>	broken record
<gehidore>	psht record... 8 track
<zekes>	diegoviola: do it in .profile or w/e?
<callipygous>	why am i getting a port 2 resume error?
<gehidore>	cause port 2 is too tired to wake up
<callipygous>	:(
<sudokode>	but like... is port 2 unusable now?
<sudokode>	or is one of your usb ports just slow to wake up from a resume...
<callipygous>	i don't know, i never tried the port
<callipygous>	i just rebooted because the error messages were spamming constantly
<sudokode>	it's not even clear if it's one port because that message is from ehci-pci which i'm guessing is the link between usb 2.0 hubs and pci on the board
<sudokode>	for the kernel anyway
<callipygous>	yeha, i wasn't getting this error with linux-chromebook kernel patches
<sudokode>	so it might just be something like your case's usb hub connected to the usb hub on your board... slow relay times
<sudokode>	shit like that
<sudokode>	could be those patches fix or ignore this issue
<callipygous>	could be
<gehidore>	^^
<callipygous>	but that kernel isn't being updated
<callipygous>	so i'm using latest 4-series kernel
<sudokode>	this is a chromebook?
<callipygous>	yes
<sudokode>	running arch?
<callipygous>	most things work with 4-series kernel
<callipygous>	yes
<sudokode>	weird
<callipygous>	weird?
<sudokode>	yeah.. i mean why buy a chromebook to throw arch on it
<callipygous>	why not?
<sudokode>	i dunno
<sudokode>	are they that cheap for decent hardware?
<sudokode>	i've never really looked into them
<callipygous>	well, i paid $259 au for it
<sudokode>	aside from the inanity that is chromeos
<callipygous>	which was pretty good for a 14" laptop
<sudokode>	yeah that's decent for a new laptop
<callipygous>	and chromeos wouldn't do what i want
<callipygous>	i.e run tuner studio
<callipygous>	or let me configure it
<sudokode>	yeah chromeos looks dumb
<callipygous>	it's probably really good for what it was intended to do
<callipygous>	but yeah, not for me
<gehidore>	it does well for what it's meant for.
<gehidore>	keeps my inner household tech support stress to a minimum
<gehidore>	gots the wife on a 14" chromebook... best 400$ i ever spent on technology for her
<sudokode>	hm. 16gb local flash. how convenient
<callipygous>	mhm
<callipygous>	lol yeah, it's a bit small
<sudokode>	plus 100gb of google storage for a year
<sudokode>	2 years
<sudokode>	so after that, everything i ever loved is gone :(
<callipygous>	or you can pay :p
<callipygous>	dearly
<sudokode>	or i can grab my handy dandy...
<callipygous>	indeed
<sudokode>	portable usb 3.0 1tb hdd
<sudokode>	:3
<sudokode>	cause i always need at least that much storage nearby
<callipygous>	i thought about hacking a 128gb flash drive in to it
<callipygous>	but sounds like a bother
<sudokode>	wonder if it's msata
<sudokode>	that would be a really easy upgrade
<callipygous>	not sure
<sudokode>	i say that like it's trivial to open a laptop anyway
<callipygous>	it's not too difficult to open this one
<callipygous>	anyways, back to my port 2 resume error -19 ...
<callipygous>	is there anything i should try?

<phrik>	title: upgrading the ssd in chromebook & mydigitalssd super boot drive m.2 2242 ssd review (at www.anandtech.com)
<sudokode>	yep
<sudokode>	they're msata
<sudokode>	msata flash has gotten a lot cheaper
<sudokode>	but damn how does google make any money from these things?
<sudokode>	i guess it's the storage
<callipygous>	any of these parameters likely to help?
<callipygous>	add_efi_memmap boot=local noresume noswap i915.modeset=1 tpm_tis.force=1 tpm_tis.interrupts=0 nmi_watchdog=panic,lapic
<sudokode>	but you could probably upgrade these things pretty easy
<callipygous>	somebody said he added those to fix my issue, but i'm not sure which one to add specifically
<callipygous>	and i don't like adding something unless i have some idea what it does
<sudokode>	oh right
<sudokode>	kernel thing
<sudokode>	not a clue
<sudokode>	though thinking back on it, this issue seems like a reason not to buy a chromebook

<tomty89>	that blog is so spoonfeeding
<tomty89>	gfx driver? it looks nice btw
<hilario>	can i have some help with disabling vsync on opensource driver please?
<tomty89>	ah that is new
<jeromelanteri>	when gparted as root, and when try to format a ssd hfs+ hdd, gparted ask me a authentication password. this is not root password (not works). what's this password need ?
<namarrgon>	http://www.techrapid.co.uk/linux/arch-linux/automatic-update-arch-linux-with-systemd/
<namarrgon>	:|
<phrik>	title: automatically update arch linux with systemd - techrapid (at www.techrapid.co.uk)
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: user password then?
<jeromelanteri>	not more
<schmodd>	hi, my thunar still refuses to let me watch samba shares or even browse the lan - i have gvfs + gvfs-smb + sshfs installed. this is my .xinitrc -> http://sprunge.us/hvcc. i am using i3. any hints?
<jeromelanteri>	looks like polkit... but i not understand and don't know which default password and where to whange/define it
<jeromelanteri>	change
<callipygous>	anybody know why i'm getting port 1 resume error -19 spammed when i wake my computer up from sleep?
<arojas>	mehdi__: that how-to is just terrible
<arojas>	they don't get a single step right
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: ehh can it be other password than the root one or the current user one?
<arojas>	read the wiki instead
<jeromelanteri>	tomty89: i would like to know that too...
<arojas>	installing the entire xorg group.... wtf
<jeromelanteri>	then i start gparted from console under root user. why it ask me a authentication password ? very strange.
<tomty89>	schmodd: despite your problem, what the heck is exec dbus-launch --exit-with-session --sh-syntax i3
<tomty89>	schmodd: and you should already have sourced 30-dbus.sh
<tomty89>	neither does it seem necessary all the time anymore
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: ehh gparted in console?
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: how's the g going then
<schmodd>	tomty89: ya i added it just to test if it has an influence since i read about it
<jeromelanteri>	start from console yes... why not ?
<tomty89>	because g means gui?
<jeromelanteri>	yes, the console is start on gui kde
<schmodd>	tomty89: but yes you are correct, dbus is already sourced at the beginning
<tomty89>	or gtk *shrug*
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: i think you mean terminal (emulator)
<jeromelanteri>	ok... my problem is not to run gparted from console from kde by root user, (this works just fine), but to understand what is this password it asked me
<jeromelanteri>	tomty89: yes terminal, right.
<jeromelanteri>	is there a link between terminal and this password asked ?
<tomty89>	shouldn't be asking any password if you run it as root, doesn't sound normal
<jeromelanteri>	that's i think too
<jeromelanteri>	do you knwo around polkit ?
<jeromelanteri>	know
<tomty89>	not much, and it seems that you already have an agent
<jeromelanteri>	agent ?
<tomty89>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/polkit#authentication_agents
<phrik>	title: polkit - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<tomty89>	i never seen polkit being triggered when i run something as root anyway
<tomty89>	perhaps it's borked?
<jeromelanteri>	yes, i think it is something like that. and then... i not read in the wiky how to define this password or what can be the default one.
<jeromelanteri>	can i remove this agent ?
<agent_white>	don't remove me!
<jeromelanteri>	or find an information who can give me the default password ?
<jeromelanteri>	i don't want the police on my computer, please, let me free...
<jasabella>	ok in /boot i have efi/ loader/ initramfs-linux-fallback.img initramfs-linux.img and vmlinuz-linux, are these in the right location?
<tomty89>	jasabella: depends
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: gparted works fine here when formatting with hfs+
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: you might try to kill your agent but i don't know if it helps
<jasabella>	depends?
<jeromelanteri>	yes, right, but he ask me that for do some job on the ssd hdd for give back some loosed places. and then ask me this password i never define nowhere.
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: what if you click ignore
<tomty89>	jasabella: ah wait, i mis-read, that should be fine for all bootloaders
<tomty89>	and loader/ probably means it's gummiboot
<jasabella>	yes
<tomty89>	!tias
<phrik>	try it and see™
<vlatkob>	i hear a sound (like a tin drum, sort of) few times a day at various times and can't figure out what's causing it. nothing in logs, nor in cinnamon log. turned off all resident apps and cron jobs. any idea where to look?
<jeromelanteri>	there is no option for "ignore", only "ok" or "cancel"... so if i cancel, it cancel and not do the job.
<tomty89>	hmm
<eyche>	hey, can someone tell me how to get xdg_data_dirs set?
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: can you screenshot what exactly it has asked?
<jasabella>	does the order of fs's in /etc/fstab matter?
<jeromelanteri>	ok
<tomty89>	jasabella: i don't think so
<tomty89>	eyche: you mean you want to change it from default?
<eyche>	tomty: well, it's not even set right now :-(
<tomty89>	ah data_dirs
<tomty89>	eyche: "if $xdg_data_dirs is either not set or empty, a value equal to /usr/local/share/:/usr/share/ should be used."

<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: which driver/partition do you want to format?
<tomty89>	*drive
<jeromelanteri>	dev/sdd1
<jeromelanteri>	it is the ocz-vertex2
<tomty89>	i don't understand why it's being requested to mount
<jeromelanteri>	it was on hfs+, i remove all right, but it ask this for do some mount and also after for clean some parts of the disk
<jeromelanteri>	i don't understand too.... but i not understand also why ask a password the user never define ?
<jeromelanteri>	it's looks like incredible.
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: i think it's just doing something wrong
<tomty89>	the password thing is just a side effect
<jeromelanteri>	i'm not able to know it.
<jeromelanteri>	i read something on the wiki around bypass pasword ask... i'm not sure it is what i really have to do
<jeromelanteri>	lik eadd a conf file on /etc/polkit... blablabla
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: i can try to see if you can run `lang=c gparted` and screenshot what thing did it ask you to do
<tomty89>	is it the only message?
<tomty89>	or does it ask you do say ok for something else first?
<jeromelanteri>	yes it is, nothing on the terminal
<jeromelanteri>	it never ask me more before
<jeromelanteri>	just open this dialog box at run time
<tomty89>	you mean once you press apply this pop up?
<jeromelanteri>	this drive has been added soon... so it is not mounted by default.
<jeromelanteri>	yes, after put the hdd on the comptuer, and after open gparted form terminal as root user, this dialog-box open at run time.
<jasabella>	i keep getting this "unable to find root device" error
<jasabella>	the uuid is correct
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: you mean before you try to do anything or after you have some actions
<jeromelanteri>	jasabella: when install bootloader by uefi with gumiboot, i had lot of problems too... when i changed and use grub, all was clean and clear.
<tomty89>	jasabella: lvm or fakeraid maybe?
<jeromelanteri>	tomty89: directly when gparted open (2 seconds after... )
<jasabella>	neither
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: no idea then. that makes no sense...
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: why the heck should it mount anything...
<shadowkatstudios>	ugh, doing a windows server core install in a vm, that was a lot of effort to install an ftpd. i much prefer sudo pacman -s vsftpd >.<
<jeromelanteri>	ok, i will try to add a config file to polkit cup files to see if it stop to ask me some password i never define...
<jeromelanteri>	tomty89: i 'don't know but for me the question more strange is: "what the sens of ask a password who not exist ?"
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: maybe  because it's using some system user to do something it shouldn't do
<jeromelanteri>	or maybe (more correctenglis): "why ask a password who not exist ?"
<tomty89>	i don't think you should care about the password
<tomty89>	more why the mount
<jeromelanteri>	is not only for mount, but alos for be able t repair something about it give me not all the place on the disk...
<tomty89>	what if you do not repair
<tomty89>	that's what i've asked you to show
<jeromelanteri>	but definitly, the logic is also to said: "don't ask a password noone has difined, it is not logic"
<tomty89>	what the hell does it ask you to repair
<jeromelanteri>	defined
<jeromelanteri>	what the hell it ask me a password i not define ?
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: my guess is the password it's just side effect because something else is messed up
<jeromelanteri>	sure, i understand, but this has no sens
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: because there are users that are locked in the systems
<jeromelanteri>	it's looks like it telle me: i don't want you do that, but i not tell you directly, i ask you a question you can not answer instead"... wtf !
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: that's kind of what i think
<jeromelanteri>	i don't want this agent on my computer anymore... lol
<jeromelanteri>	can i remove this s... ?
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: instead of "i don't want you to do that", it may be "i have been drove crazy so don't ask me to do anything before you fix it"
<jeromelanteri>	maybe.
<jeromelanteri>	so... no solution ? and impossible to remove this cops ?
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: i said you can try kill the agent, or even stop polkitd, but that's only for testing, not a solution
<jasabella>	it doesntn seem to like partitions being referred to by uuid, only /dev/sdax
<jeromelanteri>	ok, i want to test without it...
<jasabella>	:(
<jeromelanteri>	how to stop polkit cop ?
<tomty89>	jasabella: paste your arch.conf in loader
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: it's not a cop, it's an agent to pass the password you enter to polkit...
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: pgrep -a polkit
<jeromelanteri>	thanks tomty89, i will stop this cop (sorry... this agent) lol
<jasabella>	title arch linux, linux /vmlinuz-linux, initrd /initramfs-linux.img, options root=/dev/sda2 rw
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: that command is not for you to stop
<tomty89>	jasabella: so
<jeromelanteri>	systemctl stop polkit ?
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: i guess that can be a way
<jasabella>	tomty89: that boots
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: but the agent might reamins
<jeromelanteri>	?
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: sigh just show me what's in pgrep -a polkit
<jeromelanteri>	killall -9  ?
<tomty89>	have some patience
<pandb>	anyone here use kdenlive?
<jeromelanteri>	696 /usr/lib/polkit-1/polkitd --no-debug
<jeromelanteri>	and
<jasabella>	but when i use root=partuuid=... it doesnt to refer to the partition, it doesnt boot
<jasabella>	and yes, i checked the uuid multiple times, it was correct
<jeromelanteri>	1836 /usr/lib/kde4/libexec/polkit-kde-athentication-agent-1
<tomty89>	jasabella: partuuid != uuid
<jasabella>	it's what's in /etc/fstab and listed by lsblk -f right?
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: pkill polkit-kde-athentication-agent-1
<jasabella>	that's what i was using
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: and then optionally you can also try stop polkit
<tomty89>	jasabella: no
<jasabella>	oh
<jasabella>	where am i supposed to get it from then?
<jeromelanteri>	lol... i kill him... and then when run again, an other one born with an other one pid lol
<tomty89>	jasabella: lsblk -o name,partuuid
<jeromelanteri>	ok, i will try something around write config files for tell him to stay quiet on my computer as soon as possible it can...
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: have you stopped polkit?
<jasabella>	hehe oops
<jeromelanteri>	yes: pkill
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: no
<jeromelanteri>	you want i stop service ? is there a service ?
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: pkill the agent, stop polkit as the service
<jeromelanteri>	ok... sorry
<tomty89>	polkit-agent != polkit
<tomty89>	if you wanna test this you can test step by step
<jeromelanteri>	i kill polkit-agent, and stop polkit...
<jeromelanteri>	and then...
<tomty89>	still spawned?
<jeromelanteri>	again wake up the f... pasword question
<jeromelanteri>	i think it is a very good cop agent
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: maybe there's a socket, let me see
<jeromelanteri>	maybe yes
<tomty89>	ah no
<jeromelanteri>	damnde....
<jeromelanteri>	damned
<tomty89>	maybe loginctl or so spawn it
<tomty89>	idk
<tomty89>	logind i mean
<tomty89>	whatever
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: i don't suggest you try further to stop it
<tomty89>	because it's not the source of the problem
<shakyj>	hey, my company has just switched to skype for business which used to be lync, is there a plugin for an arch im client as normal skype doesn't seem to like it
<jeromelanteri>	ok, ok... you try to helpo me a lot allready, i will follow my time to investigate how to be free with this agent on my computer.
<jeromelanteri>	thanks for try to help, if i find the solution, i will go back tell it.
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: especially if you have never touched any rule files
<jeromelanteri>	yes
<jeromelanteri>	never
<jeromelanteri>	i have only one, and it is the original one (wiki show the same)
<jeromelanteri>	so i will try to add the wiki file suggestion for shoot off the password question.
<jeromelanteri>	(if it is this one the wiki talk about)
<tomty89>	what?
<jeromelanteri>	on the wiki, they talk about a rule file to add
<jeromelanteri>	aother one that this default one.
<tomty89>	!thewiki
<phrik>	the wiki is full of lies!
<tomty89>	not sure which one are you talking about though
<jeromelanteri>	ho my god !
<jeromelanteri>	ths one you send me
<tomty89>	usually you don't have to touch any rule file
<tomty89>	i just want to tell you there are agents
<tomty89>	that's why the link has a #
<jeromelanteri>	usually, i never see a dialog box opened for ask me a stupid question i can not answer.
<jeromelanteri>	usualy, when i'm root, i'm root.
<jeromelanteri>	full power.
<tomty89>	stop being pissed about that, doesn't help
<jeromelanteri>	usually... before. now it is a new world.
<tomty89>	if you really don't wanna care about it just don't use gparted
<jeromelanteri>	thanks tomty89, have a good day.
<tomty89>	it's ugly anyway
<tomty89>	!bye
<jeromelanteri>	!bye
<wasamasa>	...
<jasabella>	so i changed arch.conf, still doesnt boot
<tomty89>	change how
<mrobvious>	hello there , i just scp'd a whole system on this one ( the content of the remote root on local root excluding boot and run ..) but i think it merged both systems as i see to have old files still
<wasamasa>	arch.conf?
<tomty89>	gummiboot
<jasabella>	to the proper partuuid
<wasamasa>	oh, ok
<tomty89>	jasabella: with root=partuuid?
<jasabella>	yup
<mrobvious>	and every time i issue pacman i get a large list of "error: duplicated database entry "
<mrobvious>	is there anyway i could remove the duplicates without having to go through these folders one by one ?
<tomty89>	jasabella: paste the output of the lsblk command maybe
<jasabella>	no internets on the machine if it doesnt boot hehe
<jasabella>	but yea
<jasabella>	i'll uet the workaround for no
<tomty89>	nvm maybe it wouldn't help
<tomty89>	i shouldn't assume you might use the wrong one if you know which sdax you are booting
<jasabella>	oh oops
<jasabella>	my fault
<jasabella>	i typed in root=... instead of root=partuuid=...
<jasabella>	:p
<tomty89>	heh hope it boot this time
<jasabella>	it did
<tomty89>	grats
<jasabella>	in loader.conf, i can specify default in this way too right? partuuid
<tomty89>	i think you use the name of the conf?
<tomty89>	like default=arch?
<jasabella>	oh ok
<jasabella>	just curious
<tomty89>	check the documentation of gummiboot, i am not sure
<tomty89>	definitely anything about the disk/partition/fs though
<tomty89>	because it wouldn't make sense
<tomty89>	*not anything
<tomty89>	whoops
<jasabella>	hmmm no internets :)
<tomty89>	bad student
<tomty89>	hmm i guess only a 4k screen can deal with lsblk -o
<jasabella>	haha forgot to install iw
<tomty89>	wonder when will there be a revolution in the base group
<tomty89>	maybe we can start making our own base-meta
<demonicmaniac3>	tomty89: not even 4k unless you also use a 10 pixel font there :p
<demonicmaniac3>	and then you'll need to be very close xd
<tomty89>	demonicmaniac3: lol
<demonicmaniac3>	looks like you'll need about 400 columns
<tomty89>	d:
<demonicmaniac3>	279 it wraps on sched
<tomty89>	name   kname maj:min fstype  mountpoint label    uuid                                 parttype                             partlabel  partuuid                             partflags  ra ro rm hotplug model            serial               size state owner group   mode       alignment min-io   opt-io phy-sec log-sec rota sched rq-size type disc-aln disc-gran disc-max disc-zero wsame wwn                    rand pkname hctl       tran
<tomty89>	subsystems          rev vendor
<ingar>	lsblk
<ingar>	lol wops
<ingar>	tomty89: yep, 2 x 1920 is not wide enough :)
<tomty89>	hmm this is nice "the default list of columns may be extended if list is specified in the format +list (e.g. lsblk -o +uuid)."
<jasabella>	dhcpd or dhcliet mmmm
<emptycup>	does anyone know how to setup netctl and wpa_supplicant to use a specific radius server?
<agent_white>	nope. nobody here. sorry. i asked them earlier.
<serutsubi>	i installed arch on a usb-stick. during boot, is it possible to load everything to ram, so i can remove the stick afterwards?
<digitalkiwi>	d_garbage awww you think about me even when i have said nothing (or damn near) in months
<digitalkiwi>	d_garbage i don't get on irc much at all for like half a year now probs...
<tomty89>	jasabella: networkd
<tomty89>	emptycup: @
<tomty89>	ah specific server, not interface
<tomty89>	serutsubi: if that's an archiso
<tomty89>	serutsubi: or some squashfs prepared by yourself, maybe
<jasabella>	i installed dhcpcd for netcfg
<jasabella>	hmmm
<keenerd>	oh man it is a kiwi.
<tomty89>	netcfg...
<jasabella>	sorry
<jasabella>	netctl
<digitalkiwi>	hi keenerd :d
<tomty89>	dhcpcd is in base i think
<jasabella>	i should really install elinks in case i come across another radius protected network
<tomty89>	serutsubi: for archiso, read the documentation, mainly about "copytoram"
<jasabella>	they make command line use of wifi so annoying
<heftig>	jasabella: why not simply run any webkit browser?
<jasabella>	i dont have a gui yet :p
<bebna>	i just *lost* a shell. as in i can't find it my desktop. i can swear i still had it yesterday. but today i can't find it by scrolling trough the windows in dwm and no trace of my commands in ~/.history either. now i have to input my curl commands again for testing my rest server. -.-*
<cw>	alucryd: hey, are you online?
<jasabella>	bebna: you know you can install browser extensions for testing rest interfaces right?
<blut>	bebna: how on earth do you scroll through windows in dwm?
<bebna>	jasabella: yeah and i probably have even postman in firefox...
<jasabella>	heeh ok
<cw>	blut: switch to a better wm /s [what scroll do you talk about? you can scroll through tags iirc]
<bebna>	blut: i only have 5 desktops, going to desktop 6 and up, dwm will put all windows on the screen. key+m for monocle and then just switch from one window to the next
<bebna>	blut: should work perhaps also with 0 on the default config
<bebna>	blut: but i can't remember if the default had 10 tags / desktops or not
<cw>	bebna: i think it was 9
<sergio>	anyone noticed gcc crashing lately ? can't reproduce everytime
<alucryd>	cw: yup, what's up?
<cw>	alucryd: i'll /query you if you don't mind
<jackwinter>	what do i need on a kde system? modemmanager-qt or libmm-qt5?  might involve the plasma applet too
<sheep>	jackwinter: libmm-qt5 replaced modemmanager-qt?
<sheep>	wait no, it's the other way around
<jackwinter>	sheep: i think it's the other way around but not sure
<sheep>	jackwinter: libmm-qt5 has been removed from the repositories.  modemmanager-qt is what you want
<jackwinter>	sheep: thanks

<g0ts1ck>	in /home/folder
<g0ts1ck>	where the db is placed
<g0ts1ck>	and it worked fine till today
<g0ts1ck>	not sure why and how
<g0ts1ck>	i basicly only created symlink to www folder
<g0ts1ck>	of .db file
<g0ts1ck>	#elenda
<g0ts1ck>	anyone ?
<sledgehammer>	g0ts1ck, why did you make that symlink?
<g0ts1ck>	for better organisation of my repository
<sledgehammer>	g0ts1ck, what have you put in your pacman.conf for this repo?
<tekken>	question... is 43c under full load good?
<demize>	depends on your hardware of course, but sure?
<sheep>	tekken: desktop or laptop?
<tekken>	demize: it's an amd fx 6300
<tekken>	desktop.
<sheep>	that's really good
<g0ts1ck>	sledgehammer: pacman.conf is fine
<g0ts1ck>	its something about the repo
<sledgehammer>	g0ts1ck, ...
<g0ts1ck>	but not sure what
<sheep>	i've seen some systems that idle at 80c
<sheep>	g0ts1ck: i think he wants to see your pacman.conf
<tekken>	sheep: what'd they have.... the 9000+ amd fx that runs like lava?
<g0ts1ck>	sheep: :)
<sheep>	tekken: no; they had poorly-designed ventilation
<tekken>	i got  the hyper evo 212
<tekken>	and a nice airy case
<tekken>	lol
<sheep>	tekken: by 'full load', do you mean with the gpu also fully loaded?
<tekken>	sheep.... it wouldn't take much to overload my 730 gt :)
<tekken>	i'm running minecraft and got 64 stress processes running
<tekken>	maybe i need to try more stuff
<tekken>	i'm also trying to work in my thermal grease.
<tekken>	i need a better program to stress test with.
<g0ts1ck>	sledgehammer: probably has to do something with lighttpd
<sledgehammer>	g0ts1ck, sure, whatever
<tomty89>	hmm seems --sh-syntax of dbus-launch is the key to make gnome apps spawn the other gvfs daemon
<tekken>	its just not getting hot
<tekken>	oh well
<tomty89>	hmm "the --autolaunch option is considered an internal implementation detail of libdbus, and in fact there are plans to change it. there's no real reason to use it outside of the libdbus implementation anyhow."
<g0ts1ck>	sledgehammer: :(
<g0ts1ck>	dont be mad my love
<sledgehammer>	g0ts1ck, you didn't answer my question, what do you expect?
<schmodd>	how do i know if
<sheep>	no
<schmodd>	how do i know if gvfs is running? is there a service or anything?
<sheep>	ps ax | grep gvfs
<sheep>	or pgrep -a gvfsd
<schmodd>	ok so its not running, haven't seen it via htop
<earnestly>	sheep: ಠ_ಠ
<schmodd>	is there a log file for gvfs? since journalctl doesn't show anything
<earnestly>	what is the real question?
<schmodd>	i cannot browse lan with thunar
<schmodd>	although i installed all the stuff gvfs gvfs-smb sshfs and i source dbus in my .xinitrc
<earnestly>	how are you intending to do that?
<angevin>	hello, /proc/asound/cards list two sound cards for my system but pulseaudio only detects one and it is the wrong one. what should i do ?
<angevin>	i want pulseaudio to use the other card
<wasamasa>	let's make phrik auto-correct all suggestions of using ps .*? | grep
<schmodd>	starting i3, launching thunar and clicking at network
<wasamasa>	and suggest using `pgrep` instead
<angevin>	i hate pulseaudio i like how slackware avoids it. like vlc in arch requires pulseaudio etc.. but in slack it doesn't
<earnestly>	schmodd: do you actually have a network that publishes from a smb server, be it windows or another samba server?
<angevin>	slackware is more polished and mature than arch
<earnestly>	angevin: vlc doesn't require pulseaudio.  and perhaps you should take your ignorant hate back to slackware
<earnestly>	oh wait, it's you
<earnestly>	!pingops
<phrik>	demize, escondida, falconindy, grawity, heftig, jelle, mrelendig/mion, tigrmesh/tigr, wonder/ioni, vodik – "release the kraken", yells earnestly
<wasamasa>	earnestly: who?
<angevin>	earnestly: by default vlc certainly uses pulseaudio in arch because that it what it says when i start it from the bash commandline you fucking moron
<schmodd>	earnestly: i do have windows pcs around, but they arent running atm. but for my understanding thunar should atleast show my smb shares. but instead i get the message that i couldnt acces /
<wasamasa>	angevin: sheesh
<earnestly>	wasamasa: i'll try find the screenshot
<earnestly>	or logs
<jackwinter>	angevin: i don't think there is anything that forces you to install pulseaudio...
<wasamasa>	angevin: you mean what grawity posted on twitter?
<wasamasa>	indeed

<phrik>	title: grawity auf twitter: "http://t.co/tu2ob4m5vv" (at twitter.com)
<angevin>	jackwinter: whatever sound doesn't work in all my apps in arch linux without it but in slackware sound just works with everything. same with openbsd
<earnestly>	yeah, that's it
<angevin>	jackwinter: arch linux is a piece of shit
<earnestly>	so again
<earnestly>	!pingops
<phrik>	demize, escondida, falconindy, grawity, heftig, jelle, mrelendig/mion, tigrmesh/tigr, wonder/ioni, vodik – i, earnestly, command you to rise from your graves and destroy this pesky mortal!
<jackwinter>	angevin: an opinion :)
<earnestly>	can you please ban him again?
<earnestly>	for good this time?
<jelle>	what's up
<earnestly>	jelle: angevin (~angevin@cpe-98-15-140-39.hvc.res.rr.com) has quit (quit: leaving) is back
<jelle>	ugh
<earnestly>	jelle: can't you ban for like, thousands of years?
<earnestly>	essentially no timeout for eir
<jelle>	not sure what the limit is
<earnestly>	jelle: 2^32-1? :p
<jelle>	but i have to go to lunch haha
<wasamasa>	lol
<earnestly>	jelle: 1 << 32
<wasamasa>	/mode #archlinux +b $a:angevin ~most_positive_integer
<demize>	the longest ban that can be set is the year 294247
<demize>	due to the postgres timestamp type limit.
<earnestly>	that's pretty unthinkable
<wasamasa>	i'd set it to 2039 for the irony
<wasamasa>	since their glorious unix system wouldn't deal with it
<sheep>	irc doesn't have expiration times for channel bans
<wasamasa>	sheep: eir does
<earnestly>	wasamasa: well to be fair, openbsd has already fixed that :p
<sheep>	eh
<demize>	earnestly: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/datatype-datetime.html
<phrik>	title: postgresql: documentation: 9.1: date/time types (at www.postgresql.org)
<wasamasa>	earnestly: oh, ok
<sheep>	earnestly: when will arch get openbsd's httpd?
<demize>	mysql's one is a lot sooner iirc
<demize>	and sqlite is just a few years
<earnestly>	sheep: when someone makes a portable version of it
<demize>	(eir supports all three.)
<wasamasa>	demize: scary
<wasamasa>	demize: actually, aren't timestamps just strings in sqlite?
<earnestly>	sheep: openbsd doesn't write portable software, they write software for their kernel, which is correct.  it takes others to port it and thus a portable version such as openssh
<demize>	wasamasa: hmm
<earnestly>	when you use openbsd stuff, on openbsd, it makes use of openbsd's api like strncat :p
<wasamasa>	demize: if that is the case, it should be no problem to use any other format than unix timestamps
<sheep>	earnestly: right
<wasamasa>	demize: and avoid year 2038 that way
<earnestly>	linux does have libbsd.h though
<sheep>	strncat is nice
<earnestly>	strlcat* sorry
<demize>	wasamasa: docs say iso8691 strings, unix timestamp integers and julian days as reals
<demize>	wasamasa: but hmm...
<sheep>	oh right
<demize>	i don't remember how eir stores it in sqlite
<earnestly>	demize: it's funny how modern dbms' fail on old "big data"
<earnestly>	demize: https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1563874 "n relatively hefty hardware (an eight-core mac pro workstation with 20-gb ram and two terabytes of raid 0 disk) but had to abort the bulk load process after six hours as the database storage had already reached many times the size of the original binary dataset"
<phrik>	title: the pathologies of big data - acm queue (at queue.acm.org)

<demize>	create table bans ( i integer primary key, channel varchar, setter varchar, mask varchar, isset bool, setdate datetime, reason varchar, action integer, actiondate datetime, "affected" text, unbanner text, unbandate datetime, type varchar, nagged integer);
<demize>	hmm
<demize>	earnestly: ouch
<tigrmesh>	demize, eir didn't capture it
<earnestly>	demize: because the old big data did clever bit packing and such
<demize>	tigrmesh: hm?
<tigrmesh>	demize, sorry.  i missed it
<demize>	uh, jelle set it, not me
<agregory>	demize: how sqlite stores a value depends more on what the application hands it than how the column was defined
<tekken>	hmm.
<demize>	agregory: datetime is an int though, and eir sends an unix timestamp it seems.
<tekken>	what's a good program to get the current clock rate of the cpu?
<agregory>	sqlite does not enforce data types, you can store anything in a datetime column
<keenerd>	tekken: cat
<tekken>	keenerd: cat is lying to me ever since i overclocked.
<earnestly>	cat /proc/cpuinfo (or lscpu, or i7z)
<tekken>	:(
<earnestly>	keenerd: i have to ask, what is your "main" computer that you use?
<keenerd>	tekken: cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq ?
<earnestly>	keenerd: is it still the x131?
<wolter>	i need help connecting to the internet on my live session. i have already ran wifi-menu correctly but the systemd service cannot start. it says: "failed to start automatically generated profile by wifi-menu."
<keenerd>	earnestly: x120e
<earnestly>	keenerd: you said how you wanted to basically go fanless, which i assumed was a lot like those/these new credit card machines
<earnestly>	or various boards like the greenarrays thing or the new mips creator
<wolter>	when i try to run /usr/lib/network/network start /etc/systemd/system/netctl@mynet.service
<keenerd>	earnestly: yeah, i keep eyeing developements in arm-land.  a $100 board is faster than than this cpu nowadays.  but i've yet to find anything that looks like a quality laptop.
<sheep>	why are you calling /usr/lib/network/network?
<wolter>	it says "profile xxx does not exist or is not readable" but the file exists, i can cat it
<earnestly>	keenerd: i sort of feel the same way, except cpu power.  sort of waiting for arm v8 heh
<sheep>	wolter: what about 'netctl start mynet'?
<tekken>	odd
<tekken>	i can't seem to get anything to read my real clock
<tekken>	in the bios it's saying 4.1
<keenerd>	earnestly: i'm more likely to side-grade to an equally old but better quality thinkpad if this one goes kaput unexpectedly.
<tekken>	but on here it says 3.5
<wolter>	sheep: it says that starting the job failed, that i look in systemd status
<grawity>	...the hell is 4.1 and 3.5
<tekken>	ghz
<grawity>	ah, clock rate
<grawity>	as opposed to rtc
<sheep>	wolter: and /etc/netctl/mynet exists?
<grawity>	tekken: where are you looking for it exactly?
<earnestly>	keenerd: not quite a side-grade but at least the x201 does support coreboot
<tekken>	i checked /proc/cpuinfo first
<tekken>	it seems to still think its set to 3.5
<tekken>	:|
<grawity>	sudo cpupower frequency-info
<grawity>	what does that one say?
<tekken>	same.
<wolter>	sheep: i call that executable just to test, i saw it mentioned in the status report
<keenerd>	earnestly: wasn't the x201 the one with terrible heat problems and bad battery life?  x200 is faster than the x120e though.
<wolter>	sheep: yes
<earnestly>	keenerd: i don't recall any issues but that might be true
<grawity>	"same"?
<sheep>	wolter: what else does systemctl status say about ut?
<sheep>	*it
<keenerd>	i might be thinking of x210 though.
<wolter>	sheep: permissions -rw-r-------
<earnestly>	keenerd: that's the thinkpads with early icore processors

<wolter>	sheep yes, but did i err before or is this a bug?

<tekken>	figured it out.
<tekken>	i didn't have the clock settings quite right... and the automatic mode screwed it up a bit.
<tekken>	works
<tekken>	idling a bit warmer now though.
<kevr>	sweet. cairo broke.
<kevr>	shit.
<kevr>	hmm..
<kevr>	i see. tis mesa package's fault.
<kevr>	interesting
<kevr>	i wonder why they would reorganize it like that
<kevr>	is there anything i can run to resolve these libgl/egl issues for me instead of manually intervening?
<kevr>	or is it just my fault for having too many aur packages
<namarrgon>	what issues?
<kevr>	namarrgon: got tons of libegl and libgl breakage. from looking at forum posts, apparently they were rearranged in the filesystem and some people had fixed the issue by soft linking them to /usr/lib for certain aur packages that are not updated to satisfy the changes
<namarrgon>	you should provide some output or logs, perhaps they do mindreading over in quakenet but not here.
<kevr>	from mesa/nvidia
<kevr>	sec.
<kevr>	namarrgon: also, why quakenet?
<sledgehammer>	kevr, just update your aur stuff - remove it first if necessary
<kevr>	sledgehammer: true; i did, for most of it, but compton-git is giving me errors for libgl, might not be linked properly or something, i dunno
<kevr>	let's see.
<sledgehammer>	kevr, were there errors when you rebuilt it?
<kevr>	yeah
<kevr>	sec
<kevr>	sledgehammer: http://sprunge.us/crie
<kevr>	however...
<kevr>	sledgehammer: http://sprunge.us/ucpl
<kevr>	i'm not sure really why it's not finding gl
<kevr>	unless i'm forced to reload the nvidia module to the new installed version to get it to recognize? not sure why that would be
<sledgehammer>	take it upstream then, it's -git after all, anything can happen
<kevr>	blah.
<kevr>	for sure. thanks.
<tigrmesh>	um.  unless i misunderstood
<tigrmesh>	!give kevr library
<phrik>	kevr: part of the compile process maps the shared libraries to the program's address space. so if libfoo.so changes, the maps in the program's address space are wrong

<eyche>	anyone know how _net_wm_icons is set for gtk2?
<tigrmesh>	ahh
<ingar>	phrik is telling nonsense
<phrik>	maybe so...
<ingar>	memory address resolution is done by the linker at runtime, not by the compiler

<phrik>	testing if phrik never speaks the truth.: [fail]
<eyche>	qt and gtk3 seem to pick up the icon theme correctly, but gtk2 doesn't seem too happy (it sets in app theme correctly though)

<kevr>	i was just letting you know something personally that wasn't in the scope of the channel
<teraflop>	i do not understand how the termite selection mode works mostly because im a dumb, but it start with ctrl-shift-space and then ... i get lost
<kevr>	meh, i can do without compton.
<g0ts1ck>	guys anyof you got any xp with lighttpd ?
<teraflop>	windows xp or experience? ^

<kevr>	i believe that was direct, not passive-aggressive.
<ahop>	hi!
<ahop>	do you remember we have spoken about usb stick automount yesterday?
<ahop>	i found a nice way to do it, but too good to be true...
<ahop>	there might be a problem, it's too simple ;)

<phrik>	title: mount - simple automount usb devices with fstab: is it normal behaviour? - unix & linux stack exchange (at unix.stackexchange.com)
<namarrgon>	that will only work for vfat and you can't rely on /dev/sdb1 to be the same all the time either
<namarrgon>	kevr: insulting someone through a private message is something i call cowardly, not direct.
<ahop>	namarrgon what do you mean by be the same all the time ?
<kevr>	...what?
<kevr>	ah well, pointless argument.
<namarrgon>	ahop: the order in which devices are detected isn't fixed, /dev/sd<xy> is not reliable

<tekken>	not to bad.

<phutchins>	i've been googling but having a hard time determining if my radeon hd 4670 (r700 series (rv730 xt) is supported by an open source driver. any ideas on how i could find out and where i might find the correct driver?
<kevr>	ah hah! looks like nvidia-libgl just got screwed up when i ran the update, reinstalling it fixed the issue.
<kevr>	schweet.
<teraflop>	yeah i stole the give alias from phrik it doesnt exists in the limnoria build
<kevr>	nice. everything is copacetic. :)
<d_garbage>	wow how out of touch am i? i just found out that you can't pay cash on london buses any more, since nearly a year ago :p
<kevr>	d_garbage: were you driving a car, or just not going out? haha
<keenerd>	phutchins: i'd say just try it.  but give the series it is almost certainly well supported by the foss driver.  (there is basically only one, called radeon.)
<d_garbage>	no, got oyster card, like the transport debit card, never tried to pay cash, just didn't notice
<kevr>	ahh.
<phutchins>	keenerd: ok awesome, thank you! i feel a little more confident...
<d_garbage>	still i would have been all right because apparently you can pay with contact-less credit/debit card too
<teraflop>	phutchins: im pretty sure the ati hd 4xxx/5xxx is supported by the radeon driver
<d_garbage>	(hate those things though, they seem like a security nightmare)
<eeelvis>	hi all. is it possible to install an older version of a program with `pacman` somehow?
<kevr>	get yourself one of those aluminum wallet protector things
<kevr>	lol
<d_garbage>	well you know, got to go with the times
<kevr>	for sure.
<d_garbage>	eeelvis, sure but why do you want to?
<eeelvis>	i have a program, which requires for me to use scala 2.9.0-1, but i have got scala 2.11.6, and i think that is what is messing it up.. (without being totally sure, i have only been working with scala for the last 4 hours :) )
<d_garbage>	eeelvis, you can't update this program?
<eyche>	hey, how does one set the icon theme correctly for gtk2?
<eeelvis>	d_garbage: the specific versions of all the dependencies are listed in different configuration files, and i just figured, that it might be easier for me just to install the version, that they want, in stead of trying to change all the config files.
<d_garbage>	eeelvis, well it's up to you. there's information on the wiki - type 'downgrade' into the search
<d_garbage>	eeelvis, this program is it propitiatory? no version in the repos or maybe the aur?
<eeelvis>	d_garbage: ok thx, i will give it a search (i would have never thought of the word downgrade myself :) )
<eeelvis>	d_garbage: do people put old versions on aur?
<sysgh0st>	a.k.a rolling back ;)
<sheep>	sometimes
<d_garbage>	eeelvis, of the program that your using that needs the old version of scala
<d_garbage>	you're
<colbyf>	hi folks, anyone here do video editing, looking for a program close to pinnacle, with lots of video and audio effects
<wasamasa>	ffmpeg
<wasamasa>	it's got lots of useless effects!
<colbyf>	yea i want useless effects
<sysgh0st>	colbyf: straight off the bat, i come to think of kdenlive.
<d_garbage>	colbyf, there's a list of applications on the wiki. i only know of avidemux it's good but not sure if it's 'advanced' enough for you
<eeelvis>	d_garbage: ah, i see. no the program is not in the aur, because it is only used by a small amount of people on my university.
<sysgh0st>	...but "lots of effects"... is ...well.. not the goal there.
<d_garbage>	eeelvis, suggest to them that they update it ;)
<wasamasa>	d_garbage: avidemux is advanced enough for actually editing sources
<eeelvis>	d_garbage: yeah, i might do that. i was just hoping to get it to work today. but you're probably right.
<wasamasa>	d_garbage: pinnacle however...
<colbyf>	ya see got my dad over to linux and he thinks its great :), but wanta something similar to pinnacle, suppose install and see
<wasamasa>	d_garbage: well, you can produce shiny shit with that :p
<sysgh0st>	colbyf: https://userbase.kde.org/kdenlive/manual/effects
<phrik>	title: kdenlive/manual/effects - kde userbase wiki (at userbase.kde.org)
<teraflop>	colbyf: lwks is on the aur
<d_garbage>	eeelvis, once you downgrade scala (assuming nothing else needs it and that causes other problems) you'll need to block it in pacman.conf see man pacman.conf under ignore package
<colbyf>	cool lightworks might be tacky enough :)
<namarrgon>	lightworks is very limited in what formats it will export to in the free version
<sysgh0st>	https://www.lwks.com/index.php?option=com_shop&view=shop&itemid=205
<phrik>	title: shop (at www.lwks.com)
<colbyf>	just looked at your link sysgh0st, that looks good to, will try kdenlive watch some uotube tutorials and hen show him. i dont do video editing
<sysgh0st>	for the "causal" video editor, who do a video or two every now and then for family/youtube/private small business, kdenlive is enough. but for more professional production, lightworks is the choice.
<colbyf>	well he aint professional, more 80s tacky wedding video productions
<earnestly>	blender comes with a great nonlinear editor
<earnestly>	which people often don't think about
<eeelvis>	d_garbage: will do. thx.
<colbyf>	heard about blender but dont want to confuse him, as its more geared for graphic animation are something
<earnestly>	it's a 3d editor, it just happens to come with a decent video editor
<colbyf>	ok
<cloudef>	video editing is lots about 3d and compositing
<cloudef>	compositing goes hand-in-hand with 3d
<cloudef>	so it sort of naturally comes to blender
<kemosabe>	question, if you went to prison for life and the aryan nation was the dominant gang in your prison and you had to convert to aryan nation to join them and receive protection from the blacks and latinos who wanted to push your shit in, why would mount -t vfat /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt/sd not let me have permissions to access the sd card?
<cloudef>	wat
<sheep>	because you didn't tell it to mount it as a particular user
<kemosabe>	cloudef: i'm afraid i'll get shanked or raped in the shower and i know i'm not big enough to stand up for myself and i don't want to have to use sudo to cp my movies to my phone
<kevr>	mount it as a user then
<holomorph>	…
<saivert>	>ellipsis instead of just three dots
<cloudef>	kemosabe: usb devices are dangerous
<cloudef>	but it seems you have sd card so it's fine
<kemosabe>	but aren't i comprimising myself by joining a group of racists and how would i even get an in do i need to smuggle some stuff in or are there just flags i can use to mount the card as my user
<sheep>	saivert:  ̕ųn̛ico͝d̢e̸
<saivert>	trying to cut down on coffee is hard
<earnestly>	kemosabe: please keep the offtopic elsewhere
<kemosabe>	earnestly: i'm just trying to figure out what flags to use
<holomorph>	then just ask your fucking question
<saivert>	there is some topic in there. hidden deep in the abyss
<kemosabe>	holomorph: i fucking did
<saivert>	you need to phrase every fucking question like it is a text adventure
<earnestly>	demize: ping? ;/
<holomorph>	welcome to /ignore
<kemosabe>	saivert: i already am so we're good there
<saivert>	yes good. we are bros now. prison bros
<kemosabe>	wait am i in a gang?
<kevr>	you are now, and the cost of being an aryan is that big joe gets to use your butt weekly.
<kevr>	don't like it? go to the blacks or mexicans with your new swastika tattoo.
<nos09>	i am trying to install tv tuner, there driver is at this address - https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/media/usb/usbtv
<phrik>	title: kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git - linux kernel source tree (at git.kernel.org)
<nos09>	how do i install it ?
<sheep>	modprobe usbtv
<nos09>	but those files ?
<earnestly>	nos09: /proc/config.gz reports config_video_usbtv=m
<earnestly>	nos09: so the driver is included as a (m)odule that you can load
<namarrgon>	modinfo usbtv
<sheep>	nos09: that stuff is already available in the stock package of the linux kernel in arch
<namarrgon>	what a generic name for a driver
<earnestly>	nos09: as namarrgon said, see modinfo
<nos09>	okay. but if i want to install those same thing on gentoo ? how do i build it ? if thats the right word ?
<earnestly>	nos09: we don't support gentoo here, try #gentoo
<sheep>	enable config_video_usbtv in your kernel config before you build it
<nos09>	sheep, okay. but how do i build it? i m new to compiling a module from source.
<namarrgon>	are you doing this in gentoo or arch?
<nos09>	in both.
<sheep>	why do you need to do this?
<nos09>	i am trying this product (tv tuner) if it works i ll want to make some project on raspbarry pi
<nos09>	so ..
<earnestly>	nos09: the kconfig, which is presented in the menu config, explains exactly what you need to do
<earnestly>	wow, not even in the right channel at all
<teraflop>	"both" is a nice workaround to avoid the kraken
<nos09>	but unfortunately its still not detected in arch after modprobing usbtv
<earnestly>	nos09: arch linux doesn't support arm, see #archlinux-arm for that
<earnestly>	it's a separate distro
<nos09>	earnestly, okay .. thought it did.
<earnestly>	!give nos09 leming
<phrik>	nos09: <leming> if you can't even get the irc channel right, the chances you can operate arch are next to nil
<nos09>	phrik, i am using arch for 19 months now. but not getting my hands that dirty. ;)
<emptycup>	does anyone know how to setup netctl and wpa_supplicant to use a specific radius server?
<holomorph>	could have fooled me
<earnestly>	!turing-test-passed
<teraflop>	nos09: or you just only need the firmware ...
<earnestly>	emptycup: the documentation of wpa_supplicant (the provided .conf) comes with tons of example configurations for such things, as for netctl, no idea.
<nos09>	teraflop, they dont provide any. except for windows.
<lesderid>	new to this channel, but phrik seems to be a cool /person/
<teraflop>	heh
<nos09>	teraflop, lsusb doesnt recongnize the device.
<selby>	i indexed hacker news =d

<namarrgon>	nos09: if lsusb doesn't show you the device then something is flawed on a deeper level
<selby>	elastic search queries are kinda silly, they get huge and confusing very quickly

<noremi>	namarrgon: huh, umount tells me that /boot isn't mounted, though i can ls /boot. file's output should be the same then
<sheep>	you can have a /boot on the root filesystem
<namarrgon>	so it isn't mounted and wasn't when you updated
<sheep>	do you have /boot in /etc/fstab?
<noremi>	namarrgon: i guess so
<noremi>	sheep: i do not
<sheep>	huh
<namarrgon>	mount /boot; file /boot/vmlinuz-linux

<noremi>	namarrgon: sda has a total of 6 partitions
<noremi>	sheep: -q returns linux 3.19.3-3. i am not on my updated system though
<namarrgon>	so all the output you pasted was from the wrong box?
<sheep>	that's why this is happening

<azalus88>	having some trouble installing arch in a dual-boot setup.
<azalus88>	after mounting the partitions, including the efi boot partition to /mnt/boot, pacstrap failed because vmlinuz-linux exists in filesyste,

<azalus88>	i already have ubuntu installed on a different partition
<azalus88>	i've never had this problem before
<namarrgon>	does it exist in /mnt/boot?
<azalus88>	yes it does. like i said, it's an efi setup and i already have ubuntu installed
<namarrgon>	ubuntu uses a different naming scheme for their kernels
<namarrgon>	run file on it, see what it is
<azalus88>	oops. looks like its a kernel from a previous arch install
<azalus88>	hehe
<azalus88>	so i guess i should just remove it?

<namarrgon>	azalus88: if it's not part of a working system anymore, sure

<sheep>	yeah that
<mrelendig>	http server*
<sheep>	web servers might sometimes be configured not to follow symlinks iirc
<g0ts1ck>	sheep:
<g0ts1ck>	look, the main problem is that, is .db file enough for symlinking the path to it ?
<g0ts1ck>	k
<sheep>	no
<sheep>	you should symlink the directory that contains it
<sheep>	actually, you should symlink the top of the repo's directory tree
<bougyman>	i need some help understanding this pcap i have; anyone want to take a look?
<sheep>	bougyman: maybe.  what do you want to know about it, and why do you need to know that?

<kevr>	lol
<sheep>	bougyman: what
<sheep>	i thought you meant like a pcap packet capture
<bougyman>	it's a joke, sheep.
<bougyman>	good morning.
<openstandards>	hello all :)
<godginrai>	morning openstandards
<openstandards>	do you know why ipxe is only on aur and not in the repo?  as development on gpxe has basically stopped and more time and effort are being put into ipxe :)
<openstandards>	hi godginrai :)
<godginrai>	openstandards: it only gets into the repo if a tu chooses to maintain it.
<openstandards>	ahhh ok
<openstandards>	i think i'll need to do a new write up on pxe booting the one on the wiki is a bit basic
<mrelendig>	do it
<openstandards>	doing it now, just going to load up a vm and figure out what needs to be done
<james0r>	if i'm wanting to dual boot arch and ubuntu using syslinux do i need to chain load ubuntu?
<hwkiller>	chain load? no
<hwkiller>	chain loading is for booting oss with their own bootloader, iirc.
<hwkiller>	you just need to specify where the ubuntu kernel and initrd are.
<sysgh0st>	want to help out with kde debugging, and i need do have kde compiled with debugging symbols turned on. is there a package for this, or do i have to compile kde myself?
<junka>	the beauty and the beast
<tigrmesh>	has phrik stopped giving the titles of urls?  has anyone noticed?
<junka>	!url
<sysgh0st>	it's dead
<sysgh0st>	poor phrik.
<tigrmesh>	!echo this is why you need strong passwords   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w76o_ig7y7g  "kids hack their dad's computer on her raspberry pi"
<phrik>	this is why you need strong passwords https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w76o_ig7y7g kids hack their dad's computer on her raspberry pi
<sysgh0st>	it's alive!
<tigrmesh>	!phrik
<phrik>	forever broken, but i'm still not your butler.
<saivert>	do you like google now?
<sysgh0st>	me? nope!
<sternmull>	when i want to ssh into a new host then it says "rsa key fingerprint is sha256:<some base64 looking thingy>". unfortunately i only know a colon separated hex rsa fingerprint. can i change the format that is shown?
<junka>	tigrmesh; lol
<junka>	i love this kid
<tigrmesh>	she's got my vote for "programmer barbie"
<junka>	tigrmesh; ++
<sysgh0st>	to answer my on previous question: -"do i have to recompile kde do enable debugging symbols?". short answer: yes. elaborate answer: arch does not provide any -debug packages like some other distributions. there is a feature request on this: https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/10975
<phrik>	title: fs#10975 : add support for separated packages with debug symbols to makepkg (patch included) (at bugs.archlinux.org)
<demize>	sternmull: `-o fingerprinthash=md5 `, but you should really find the sha256/base64 one in the future
<sysgh0st>	right now i find it easier to install a "sanbox distribution" with kde debugging installed/enabled just to hunt down bugs. recompiling the whole kde suite just for some debugging takes too much time. :s
<sternmull>	demize: thank you! unfortunately the host only publishes the md5 version on its website. it seems to be "standard". for example github uses this format: https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-github-s-ssh-key-fingerprints/
<phrik>	title: what are github's ssh key fingerprints? - user documentation (at help.github.com)
<earnestly>	tigrmesh: i'm so glad that the ps(1) output truncates the chrome arguments
<demize>	sternmull: it's the old "standard".
<tigrmesh>	earnestly, hehe
<sudokode>	ah
<sternmull>	demize: maybe. but as a user i am forced to take what the hosts give me.
<sudokode>	sternmull: md5 and rsa are not comparable
<sudokode>	what are we looking at there
<sternmull>	sudokode: i think what the hosts show on their website is the hexadecimal md5 of the rsa key. at least that is what is identical to ssh with the options that demize gave me.
<sudokode>	oic
<demize>	yes
<sudokode>	yeah, it's best to find a sha version of a key's fingerprint
<demize>	since 6.8 it prints the base64 of the sha256 sum instead.
<sudokode>	hm
<earnestly>	why is the base64 necessary?
<demize>	but 6.8 is the current version, so not surprising that people haven't published the new format
<sudokode>	earnestly: that will shorten it, won't it?
<sternmull>	yes
<sudokode>	earnestly: human eyeballs might have to look at it one day :p
<earnestly>	even so
<sudokode>	!shrug
<phrik>	¯\(º_o)/¯
<demize>	well
<earnestly>	i guess sha256 isn't very long but they can get longer
<sudokode>	256 bits
<sudokode>	!math calc 256/8
<phrik>	sudokode: 32
<demize>	well, no, it shouldn't shorten it.. hmm...
<earnestly>	well there goes that assumption
<demize>	the base64 will be longer
<demize>	i'm not sure how they actually calculate it though..
<sternmull>	base64 encodes 6 bits in one char, hex only 4. so base64 is shorter.
<sudokode>	demize: yeah
<sudokode>	http://sprunge.us/ghah
<sudokode>	i dunno
<sudokode>	oh well, that isn't right, you get the idea
<demize>	sternmull: this isn't about hex vs base64.
<demize>	sudokode: indeed.
<sudokode>	mjrlztiymjk5ztkxzgixmzrhztnimdlmnzhkzdrjngjiyjy3m2e2n2q4mdrmnwy4otexognjzge2
<sudokode>	njzky2flywo=
<demize>	sudokode: the base64 isn't just a base64 of the sha, so what is it..
<sternmull>	sudokode: isnt it colon separated hex vs. base64?
<sudokode>	hm
<sudokode>	yes it is
<earnestly>	it's base64 of host and a salt
<sternmull>	sorry, ment demize
<earnestly>	known hosts anyway
<sudokode>	earnestly: that would make more sense
<sudokode>	yeah
<demize>	earnestly: host?
<demize>	base64: invalid input
<demize>	hmm
<earnestly>	demize: hash_type + base64_salt + base64_host
<earnestly>	or
<earnestly>	h|s|h
<demize>	host what?
<demize>	host key?
<sudokode>	host fingerprint?
<earnestly>	hostname
<sudokode>	they base it off hostname?
<demize>	earnestly: what would the salt be then?
<earnestly>	demize: some 160bit string
<sudokode>	demize: random
<earnestly>	apparently
<demize>	the key doesn't have the hostname
<earnestly>	this is known_hosts though
<demize>	earnestly: and it's part of the public key?
<earnestly>	don't think so
<demize>	then you're wrong
<sudokode>	demize: ssh generates the fingerprint when you connect
<demize>	because the fingerprint is calculated from the public key
<sudokode>	it'll change when the host changes
<sudokode>	and it'll change if other things change
<demize>	sudokode: if the key changes, nothing else
<sudokode>	demize: no, the ssh server also generates something i believe
<earnestly>	hm, it probably is different now
<demize>	sudokode: you can do it with your local hostkey with ssh-keygen
<sudokode>	hm
<earnestly>	ssh-keygen -lf ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
<saivert>	also the hostname of the server if i'm not mistaken
<demize>	oh wait, the key does have the host, so yeah
<demize>	but, hmm.
<muchweb>	are init.d scripts removed from arch packages?
<sudokode>	the authenticity of host '192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1)' can't be established.
<sudokode>	rsa key fingerprint is sha256:sltxzkfsqzuq2syk0020/esaad9bvx4tiue4diicvxg.
<sudokode>	hm
<demize>	muchweb: they are useless on arch, so yes.
<red-lichtie>	what package do i need to install to get the cinnamon sound effects files?
<demize>	let's see..
<tomty89>	libcanberra*?
<sudokode>	!ping
<phrik>	sudokode: ping [--c <count>] [--i <interval>] [--t <ttl>] [--w <timeout>] <host or ip>
<sudokode>	._.
<demize>	https://stelfox.net/blog/2014/04/calculating-rsa-key-fingerprints-in-ruby/
<tomty89>	hmm there's so lib32-libcanberra-gstreamer
<sudokode>	lol
<sudokode>	demize: well my router gives me what looks like base64
<sudokode>	haven't looked at its config
<demize>	sudokode: your client gives you.
<sudokode>	well, i mean connecting to the router's server
<sudokode>	it should be the same no matter which client connects
<sudokode>	that's kinda the point
<demize>	it's your client that takes care of what kind of fingerprint it will print -.-'
<sudokode>	demize: should it print the same type every time?
<sudokode>	oh yeah. looks like it does print base64 by default now
<demize>	it will always print the base64'd rsa256 since 6.8, that's what default mean.
<sudokode>	i'm used to seeing the hex
<demize>	<demize> since 6.8 it prints the base64 of the sha256 sum instead.
<wolter>	i can't chroot into my install, i did it before just fine but now i get an error about udev being already mounted or busy, and error: failed to setup api filesystems in chroot /mnt/
<wolter>	before this i did a find operation and canceled it with control+c
<demize>	ah, the reason for the invalid output thing is that they strip the equals sign at the end.
<sudokode>	wolter: are you using arch-chroot?
<wolter>	yes sudokode
<demize>	sudokode: https://theos.kyriasis.com/~kyrias/s/0cqymbfkrz.png
<sudokode>	wolter: mount | grep mnt
<sudokode>	ah
<shakyj>	hey, i got a load of suggestions of things i can change to save more battery from powertop http://kopy.io/ukgef but
<phrik>	title: kopy.io (at kopy.io)
<shakyj>	how can i safely do them?
<wolter>	sudokode: udev is mounted on /mnt/dev as a devtmpfs
<wolter>	regular chroot does work
<tomty89>	shakyj: udev rules
<tomty89>	shakyj: i wonder how many of them are not default
<eeelvis>	hi all. is there a way, i can see what repo a specific package is from (eg. multilib/core/extra). i tried `pacman -i -i -q <pkg>` but no dice.
<tomty89>	shakyj: ahh seems "on" is default all "pci devices"
<sudokode>	wolter: k that's a bind mount
<sudokode>	you've got a partial chroot setup essentially
<sudokode>	arch-chroot sets up /dev, /tmp, /proc, /sys, and /run in the mountpoint you give it
<sudokode>	to make chrooting that much easier
<sudokode>	so just umount any of those in /mnt and then arch-chroot again
<tomty89>	seems the second time i saw that a ctrl+c makes arch-chroot exited with mess left
<sudokode>	that's odd
<sudokode>	wolter: did the find involve -exec?
<sudokode>	i don't think that'd be the reason, but it's all i can think of
<wolter>	ok, perhaps i entered a command without noticing by pressing keys
<sudokode>	lol fun
<wolter>	sudokode now it works, thank you!
<sudokode>	np
<shakyj>	tomty89: cheers, i will hit the wiki up now for it
<tomty89>	btw i don't think you need to match every devices explicitly
<sudokode>	earnestly: what's your current project?
<demize>	i wonder if there's any ruby library or whatever to convert a openssh-style public key to a pem..
<shakyj>	tomty89: yeah, i am going to play and try see which gives me the best battery
<sudokode>	demize: openssl
<tomty89>	shakyj: i mean if you really want autosuspend for all those devices, probably a subsystem match is enough
<sudokode>	there must be a ruby lib for it
<demize>	sudokode: what?
<tomty89>	shakyj: anyway just a hint, good luck
<demize>	openssl doesn't do openssh keys?
<sudokode>	demize: where do you think openssh gets its keys from?
<demize>	sudokode: it has its own key format, like i just said.
<sudokode>	why
<sudokode>	that's stupid
<demize>	for one they're shorter.
<sudokode>	demize: oh you mean fingerprints?
<demize>	no....
<mmarker>	been like that since ssh1 and before openssh.
<sudokode>	demize: don't see how they can be any shorter then
<demize>	sudokode: look at your known_hosts file.
<sudokode>	demize: that's not the key
<demize>	sudokode: do you see any pem certs there?
<demize>	it .s
<sudokode>	that's a fingerprint of the key
<demize>	is*
<sudokode>	it's not the key
<sudokode>	it may represent the key
<demize>	that is the k.ey
<sudokode>	only if you trust the hash algorithm you give it
<sudokode>	demize: you're telling me you use that to sign stuff?
<mmarker>	even the key isnt a pem. you can squeeze one in, but that'll cause theo to go uber crazy.
<demize>	what?
<sudokode>	i don't understand what you're saying right now
<demize>	are you dump or something...
<sudokode>	!grab demize
<phrik>	sudokode: tada!
<demize>	just shut up and compare the key in the known hosts file to the public key on the server.
<earnestly>	demize: heh, rust is adding inheritance and virtual structs after all.
<sudokode>	demize: okay, so it stores the whole public key in there
<demize>	earnestly: what changed their minds?
<earnestly>	or not
<kevr>	daaaaamn son
<kevr>	use public and private!

<sudokode>	demize: also, no. you need a private key to generate a pem

<sudokode>	you don't need a private key to generate a certificate for a private key?

<red-lichtie>	that was how i found the source of the audio files

<red-lichtie>	tomty89: i checked out the gnome one 1st
<red-lichtie>	the sound effects are good though :-d
<tomty89>	red-lichtie: i don't think you should bother
<tomty89>	red-lichtie: it's an ancient one
<tomty89>	just write one yourself
<red-lichtie>	tomty89: 18 feb 2015 is ancient ?
<namarrgon>	dyce: isos? regular disk images?
<dyce>	namarrgon: i want to have a weekly build of an arch iso minimal configuration with kvm and https://github.com/kimchi-project/kimchi
<phrik>	title: kimchi-project/kimchi · github (at github.com)
<namarrgon>	dyce: have you looked at 'archiso'?
<tomty89>	red-lichtie: huh which one are you talking about
<sudokode>	demize: so what are you trying to do again
<sudokode>	convert the ssh public key in known_hosts to pem?
<demize>	earnestly: anyway, the fingerprint is \x00\x00\x00\a + 'ssh-rso' + exponent + modulus then sha256 hash that and then base64 it
<red-lichtie>	tomty89: i was talking about making an aur for http://packages.linuxmint.com/pool/main/m/mint-artwork-cinnamon/
<phrik>	title: index of /pool/main/m/mint-artwork-cinnamon/ (at packages.linuxmint.com)
<tomty89>	oh i thought you are talking about the aur package i talked about
<wolter>	why can't i log in with my new user?
<namarrgon>	what error do you get on login?
<red-lichtie>	i saw that it was unmaintained and didn't have the sound files anyway
<wolter>	it is in the wheel group and has a password
<wolter>	just login incorrect
<mrelendig>	check the log
<mrelendig>	well wrong password then most likely
<namarrgon>	how did you create the user?
<red-lichtie>	now i only have to find out how to make one :-d
<grawity>	demize: that \x00\x00\x00\a is the sshv2 string framing
<grawity>	demize: so it'll vary based on algorithm length
<demize>	makes sense
<tomty89>	red-lichtie: shouldn't be too difficult
<grawity>	32-bit length prefix
<tomty89>	red-lichtie: probably just cp or mv the whole usr inside
<grawity>	also *apparently* that's the only sane way to recognize the key material from algorithm name, when parsing authorized_keys >_<
<wolter>	namarrgon: useradd -m -g wheel -s /bin/bash wolter
<tomty89>	red-lichtie: or install a directory and copy all the sound file only
<red-lichtie>	tomty89: i'm new to arch so it'll take a few weeks to get up to speed
<wolter>	but with zsh instead
<namarrgon>	wolter: grep zsh /etc/shells
<red-lichtie>	tomty89: i already copied them out to /usr/share/sounds/mint-artwork-cinnamon on my system. is making a "partial" aur of the upstream ok?
<wolter>	no output. changing my shell to  bash worked
<namarrgon>	you don't have zsh installed?
<wolter>	how do i enable zsh?
<sysgh0st>	how do i change which file manager that is the default in x.org? every time an application calls the default app for opening directories, it opens an mp3 tag software. i guess i have to find the proper mime for this, but where?
<red-lichtie>	and calling it "mint-audio-cinnamon" or something?
<red-lichtie>	not sure on the conventions
<grawity>	sysgh0st: xdg-mime or something, see wiki article
<tomty89>	red-lichtie: when i said cp/mv i didn't mean by doing it in the actual system
<grawity>	sysgh0st: specifically for the "inode/directory" pseudo-mimetype
<tomty89>	red-lichtie: but from $srcdir to $pkgdir in a pkgbuild
<wolter>	ah i thought i had installed it but i only copied some files over from the install media, i need to do it the pacman way
<mrelendig>	what files did you copy?
<tomty89>	red-lichtie: if you want to manage those files as a package, you have to undo what you've done
<tomty89>	red-lichtie: then write a pkgbuild and make a package, then install it
<red-lichtie>	tomty89: i haven't looked into making a pkgbuild yet, that will be next
<red-lichtie>	i just wanted to get my sounds working :-)
<sysgh0st>	grawity: ah. right.. xdg-mime might be able to do the job, and yes. it's inode/directory that is set to prefer my mp3 tagging software in first hand. (how did that happen???)
<red-lichtie>	i'm suprised that it isn't part of the core cinnamon installation tbh
<tomty89>	i'm suprised how crazy cinnamon is lol
<mrelendig>	cinnamon devs only cares about mint
<tomty89>	hence mint is crazy as well :p
<tomty89>	nvm
<red-lichtie>	it looks as though it was historically added to the existing "theme" stuff at some point, for that special "mint" flavour
<demize>	earnestly: before when you asked about why it was base64, did you mean instead of hex ar just instead of leaving it unbase64'd?
<red-lichtie>	tomty89: agreed :-d
<demize>	actually, the answer is the same i guess
<tomty89>	red-lichtie: if you don't want to make a package yet, i don't suggest you moving all stuff in the package to your system
<tomty89>	red-lichtie: cause it will be a hassle to remove them
<earnestly>	demize: leaving it unbased ;p
<tomty89>	red-lichtie: so if it will work once the oga/ogg is there, then only copy those audio file
<red-lichtie>	tomty89: it's a simple "rm -r" as i only copied the oga files
<demize>	earnestly: basically, it doesn't do a normal hash like you'd get from sha256sums
<tomty89>	red-lichtie: so does it work now?
<earnestly>	demize: evidently now
<demize>	earnestly: with md5 they used a hexdigest, now with sha256 they just use a regular digest
<demize>	earnestly: which is binary.
<demize>	and the base64'd digest is shorter than the hexdigest would be
<red-lichtie>	tomty89: yes, unpacked and manually copied the files already to where i thought they should be
<demize>	6b8e8635eada1105c9d8563a962bae9d1315b00f2b8683ad3edecf15c8702de8 vs
<demize>	a46gneraeqxj2fy6liuunrmvsa8rhootpt7pfchwleg
<tomty89>	red-lichtie: but do you hear them? :p
<red-lichtie>	tomty89: yes :p
<sysgh0st>	this is strange: "xdg-mime query default inode/directory" gives: dolphin.desktop. as expected. but whener any java application calls for the default folder browser, the mp3 tagging software opens instead.
<red-lichtie>	i had to point to each one in the sound settings first though
<tomty89>	red-lichtie: well, that's a good news
<tomty89>	wat
<tomty89>	red-lichtie: no default path mentioned in the settings?
<red-lichtie>	default path is /usr/share/mint-artwork-cinnamon/sounds
<polyzen>	any archhaskell people here? looking to install gitit. the wiki page for ah says it should be in haskell-happstack, but it doesn't seem to be there
<harbingtarbl>	is there a way to install packages from a group that are missing? for example 'pacman -s base' but only install whatever is missing?
<polyzen>	also, i expected cabal and ghc to be packaged in the official repos
<tomty89>	red-lichtie: you didn't put them there?
<red-lichtie>	tomty89: sorry, i misunderstood you, no there wasn't but that might have been because the files were missing
<tomty89>	oh
<tomty89>	sigh
<red-lichtie>	tomty89: i put them in /usr/share/sounds/mint-artwork-cinnamon
<tomty89>	i never liked those gnome forks anyway
<red-lichtie>	cinnamon is a eally nice integration, i think it gets everything right
<grawity>	they never liked you either
<red-lichtie>	s/eally/really/
<tomty89>	i'm used to be hated
<fizzlerr>	can anyone tell me if the debian package "python-opencv" is equivelant to the arch package "opencv"? many thanks.
<mrelendig>	-ql it and see what it contins
<tomty89>	doesn't sound so
<mrelendig>	or use the web interface
<holomorph>	fizzlerr: pacman -ss opencv
<holomorph>	oh. nvm
<yuvadm>	can systemd user units be completely daemonized? i.e remain active even if user has logged out?
<yuvadm>	or do they have to be system units for that?
<harbingtarbl>	anyone have experience with ovh? using an arch server from them and it seems all kinds of screwed up.
<tomty89>	maybe opencv here is the superset
<mrelendig>	how is it screwed up?
<hyo0301>	yo
<tomty89>	sigh python2
<harbingtarbl>	missing ldns, missing half the packages in base. it has a bunch of packages installed (files present in the fs) without a record in pacman that they're actually installed.
<tomty89>	fizzlerr: https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/opencv/files/
<phrik>	title: arch linux - opencv 2.4.10-2 (x86_64) - file list (at www.archlinux.org)
<hyo0301>	is arch linux kernel 2.6.x or 3.x?
<mrelendig>	pacman -si opencv
<demize>	earnestly: oh, i found out the differece between the digest and the hex digest
<harbingtarbl>	hyo0301: 3.14
<mrelendig>	see the optdep
<tomty89>	fizzlerr: we are newer btw, so not equivalent
<tomty89>	hyo0301: neither
<demize>	earnestly: the former is backed into a byte string, so eg 7a is turned into the byte \x7a
<tomty89>	hyo0301: unless you are talking about -lts
<demize>	packed*
<hyo0301>	tomty89: how do i install it to vmware then
<mrelendig>	hyo0301: don't use vmware
<fizzlerr>	tomty89: darn. i will be needing the python 2 version. thanks
<mrelendig>	vmware supports 3.14 btw
<mrelendig>	and newer
<hyo0301>	it does
<mrelendig>	there is patches for 4.0
<hyo0301>	that's why i said 3.x or 2.6.x
<tomty89>	fizzlerr: isn't there only python2 version for it
<mrelendig>	but vmware is evil and should not be used
<hyo0301>	so i'll just use oracle
<mrelendig>	fizzlerr: ....
<tomty89>	fizzlerr: i mean we got opencv 2.4 here
<wolter>	ahh one more thing i guess: i can't get my internet interface (wifi device that uses b43) and i don't have b43 fwcutter, what can i do? can i extract it from my install media?
<tomty89>	fizzlerr: unlike 2.3 in debian
<namarrgon>	wolter: "install media"?
<tomty89>	or is it the wrong release i was looking at
<mrelendig>	wolter: pacman -u
<mrelendig>	just download the fwcutter package and the broadcom blob
<wolter>	namarrgon: my install usb
<mrelendig>	pacman -u the fwcutter, extract the firmware
<namarrgon>	wolter: yeah but which one? the official iso doesn't have b43-firmware inculuded
<mrelendig>	wolter: the install image does have fwcutter on it
<eyche>	i'm having troubles with my gtk2 not using the icon theme in its _net_wm_icon.
<grawity>	oh, on a related note, if i'm planning to buy a new laptop, which wifi manufacturers should i avoid like hell?
<mrelendig>	grawity: all of them suck sadly
<tomty89>	fizzlerr: oh seems debian stable has 2.4 as well
<grawity>	atheros doesn't
<wolter>	namarrgon but it has b43 fwcutter, i have the blob already
<mrelendig>	specially if you want ac
<mrelendig>	atheros do suck
<mrelendig>	half their chips are buggy as fuck
<dunp>	aur/b43-firmware
<wolter>	mrelendig how can i mount the install media?
<polyzen>	ah... arch arm doesn't compile ghc and cabal-install.... cool.....
<fizzlerr>	tomty89: ah yes. i was thinking this package only contained the cpp files. i see there are the python files as well
<mrelendig>	wolter: just boot it
<red-lichtie>	atheros gets a -1 from me too
<mrelendig>	sadly there isn't a single actually good wifi chip maker
<tomty89>	ethernet hurray
<grawity>	i don't care enough about ac, i want it to work reliably and be able to do fancy stuff, which my current ath9k does (including even spectral scan features), and i might just put the old card into my new laptop
<wolter>	mrelendig oh and i send the firmware to my system partition, clever, will do
<mrelendig>	polyzen: ghc on arm is a bit troublesome
<fizzlerr>	tomty89: so it looks like all they did was strip out the cpp files and package the python seperately
<red-lichtie>	get a wifi cable, they are awesome!
<polyzen>	mrelendig, fantastic
<tomty89>	4glte
<polyzen>	a what
<tomty89>	usb tethering
<mrelendig>	polyzen: it works, but might require some sledgehammer usage due to linking mess
<mrelendig>	also you must use llvm
<polyzen>	:|
<mrelendig>	polyzen: http://smart-cactus.org/~ben/posts/2014-11-28-state-of-llvm-backend.html  etc
<phrik>	title: bgamari.github.com - ghc and llvm: a status update (at smart-cactus.org)
<mrelendig>	changed a bit with 7.10
<mrelendig>	there is another blog post about that by a different dev
<bu5hm4n>	hi does someone have experience working with udisk2 dbus api ?
<hyo0301>	installing arch is harder than creating a new programming language
<mrelendig>	no, specially not the gnome/kde devs etc
<mrelendig>	bu5hm4n: ^
<sheep>	hyo0301: really?
<hyo0301>	yup
<mrelendig>	installing arch is easy
<bu5hm4n>	mrelendig thx :)
<sheep>	installing arch takes 5 minutes
<keenerd>	hyo0301: try both and get back to us.
<sheep>	minus the time needed for downloading the packages
<holomorph>	5 valve minutes amirite
<wasamasa>	i also spend 5 valve minutes on each achievement in my games
<wasamasa>	it's totally awesome
<grawity>	i'm curious how the hell does one partition, mkfs, edit locale.conf, set hostname, etc. in 5 minutes
<hyo0301>	keenerd:  try both what?
<ingar>	sheep: every 5-minute job takes at least half an hour
<sheep>	grawity: you wreite down what you need before
<sheep>	*write
<wasamasa>	grawity: simple, you're asian
<mrelendig>	grawity: that is not that hard, how one download 5gib in the same time also on the other hand...
<wasamasa>	grawity: let's publish arch install speedruns on youtube
<grawity>	!grab wasamasa
<phrik>	grawity: tada!
<wasamasa>	i'd watch these
<mrelendig>	you need some pretty impressive hardware for that
<keenerd>	hyo0301: try creating a new programming language.
<wasamasa>	or read the "fuck you and your tas" comments
<grawity>	every single time i had to install arch, the configuration took much longer than the download
<grawity>	mrelendig: that's just ~128 mbps though
<hyo0301>	keenerd: sure, then i can make my own os, which will be easy to install and no confusing wiki
<wasamasa>	lol
<wasamasa>	if you find the arch wiki confusing...
<keenerd>	hyo0301: like i said, try it already.
<wasamasa>	that leaves no useful wiki
<grawity>	mrelendig: many mirrors do 100 mbps, so that's less than 10 minutes
<mrelendig>	grawity: in the same time
<mrelendig>	so if you spend 3 minutes partitioning and writing configs etc
<demize>	grawity: wonder how hard it would be to add ecdsa/ed25519 support to https://gist.github.com/tombh/f66de84fd3a63e670ad9
<grawity>	but anyway, the whole "arch in 5 minutes, just add water" thing is bullshit
<phrik>	title: convert openssh public key to openssl public key using ruby (at gist.github.com)
<mrelendig>	20 mins though is perfectly realistic
<mrelendig>	from boot of install image to desktop
<sheep>	well openssl doesn't have ed25519 support yet
<grawity>	demize: cheat: kernel.spawn("ssh-keygen -yf id_ed25519")
<grawity>	sheep: doesn't have to – it's just a matter of data structures, not actual crypto
<grawity>	especially given that openssh uses a completely new storage format for ed25519
<grawity>	so openssl would not help either way
<sudokode>	haha
<demize>	grawity: -y?
<hyo0301>	meh it's because i don't get the same as the turials wasamasa
<tomty89>	!man
<phrik>	tomty89: http://www.mankier.com/?q=urlquote <text>
<grawity>	demize: yes
<wasamasa>	hyo0301: if you actually wish for help, ask better questions than that
<grawity>	demize: owait, in the opposite direction
<demize>	well
<demize>	i want public key -> pem
<diegoviola>	when i startx i already have ssh-agent, any ideas what triggers that?
<grawity>	pretty sure there's no 'standard' pem structure for ed25519 yet
<sheep>	diegoviola: maube it
<hyo0301>	wasamasa: ok then, go boot archlinux, i type cfdisk, i create an sda1, sda2, and sda3, i have to flag sda1 as boot
<grawity>	nor pkcs#8 either
<demize>	or well, *something* that openssl can parse.
<demize>	mmm...
<diegoviola>	sheep: ?
<sheep>	diegoviola: wait.  that depends on what process is providing the ssh-agent functionality
<hyo0301>	wasamasa: but i don't have the "bootable" button at the bottom
<demize>	grawity: what it's for is basically a script that does `ssh-keygen -lf <key> -e md5` and then the same with -esha256
<wasamasa>	hyo0301: http://i.imgur.com/mftq1fn.png
<demize>	grawity: no real reason for it, i was firstly just interested in the format.
<wasamasa>	hyo0301: it is a thing (for existing partitions obviously)
<tomty89>	gpt?
<sheep>	diegoviola: run this: ps -q $ssh_agent_pid au
<sheep>	diegoviola: what command does it return?
<grawity>	demize: find protocol.key in the openssh source tree
<youngwolf>	any one here use ttytter ??
<grawity>	demize: describes the new format
<grawity>	putty supports it in -git
<hyo0301>	wasamasa: i know, but i odn't have the "bootable" button
<demize>	err, i meant the fingerprint formats, sorry.
<sudokode>	ah
<diegoviola>	  pid tty          time cmd
<polyzen>	good to know grawity> putty supports it in -git
<hyo0301>	http://puu.sh/hbdtx/46b7b27fbd.png wasamasa
<diegoviola>	  337 ?        00:00:00 ssh-agent
<sudokode>	demize: ssh-keygen -f ssh.pub -em pem > ssh.pem
<deusardor>	ignore this
<wasamasa>	hyo0301: great, you're using gpt
<demize>	sudokode: i wanted it in ruby.
<wasamasa>	hyo0301: use cgdisk, you sillyhat
<grawity>	hyo0301: gpt and mbr partition tables have different settings
<hyo0301>	it was gpt, sun, dos or some other sht
<polyzen>	doesn't gpt not have a bootable flag
<hyo0301>	ohhhhhh
<hyo0301>	but i didn't hae a mbr option
<hyo0301>	fck this
<tomty89>	polyzen: well legacy boot
<grawity>	hyo0301: "dos" is mbr
<polyzen>	hm
<polyzen>	tomty89, i shouldn't pipe in on things i've hardly used :p
<sheep>	diegoviola: check /etc/profile.d
<grawity>	polyzen: it does, among other flags, but apparently cfdisk is missing it?
<sheep>	hyo0301: is that cgdisk?
<diegoviola>	sheep: what exactly should i look there?
<sheep>	diegoviola: something that starts ssh-agent
<hyo0301>	grawity: oh god... i'll redo it
<hyo0301>	sheep:  nope, it's gpt
<tomty89>	probably there's already a gpt there before
<grawity>	hyo0301: gpt is fine, but instructions for it will be a little different
<demize>	grawity: anyway, thanks, i'll look at that too.
<sudokode>	demize: https://github.com/bensie/sshkey
<sheep>	hyo0301: i meant, are you using cgdisk to set up the partition?
<phrik>	title: bensie/sshkey · github (at github.com)
<sudokode>	looks like that implements the functions of ssh-keygen
<tomty89>	sadly cfdisk doesn't have a "o"
<hyo0301>	sheep, no because the tutorial i'm using is for mbr
<sheep>	oh ok
<demize>	sudokode: emphasis on wanted.
<sudokode>	pfft
<hyo0301>	grawity: apparently it is
<tomty89>	shred your disk
<sudokode>	too many technicalities
<demize>	sudokode: i've had rsa/dsa working ages now.
<polyzen>	grawity ¯\(º_o)/¯
<tomty89>	diegoviola: pstree?
<grawity>	diegoviola: grep -r ssh-agent /etc/gdm /etc/x11
<diegoviola>	http://sprunge.us/fknz
<diegoviola>	^ pstree
<sheep>	tomty89: ssh-agent daemonizes
<diegoviola>	grawity: i don't have gdm
<diegoviola>	nothing in /etc/x11
<sklv>	gentoo
<sheep>	that was the lamest troll i've ever seen in this channel
<wasamasa>	s/lamest/tamest/
<diegoviola>	lol
<sudokode>	sheep: would've been better if he was in #gentoo
<sudokode>	i was gonna say arch to him there
<tomty89>	diegoviola: it's there right after login?
<tomty89>	or startx?
<hyo0301>	should i pacstrap base base-devel or just base?
<tomty89>	i prefer both
<fizzlerr>	yeah i do both
<hyo0301>	i gusee just base then
<fizzlerr>	base-devel is for users who will be developing software and using aur packages
<tomty89>	heh developing software
<hyo0301>	i'm as new to arch as an amish grandfather is to html
<tomty89>	sudo is in base-devel btw
<d_garbage>	heh, shall i do a or b. do b. do b. ok, i'll do a
<d_garbage>	}:]
<holomorph>	flawless reasoning
<fizzlerr>	hyo0301: base-devel contains packages that make compiling packages easier. fakeroot and a few other tools
<tomty89>	irc is full of lies
<tomty89>	he's the smarter one
<sudokode>	i wouldn't trust us either
<hyo0301>	i'll do a and b then -.-
<sudokode>	that's not possible
<sudokode>	i mean it is, but it has no net effect
<hyo0301>	just like memes
<sudokode>	well now i'm just confused
<sudokode>	back to youtube
<henry_jia_t60>	hey guys
<sudokode>	hey
<tomty89>	hey girls
<henry_jia_t60>	i'm trying to install arch linux with encrypted swap and home partition
<fizzlerr>	*chirp
<d_garbage>	superstar dj, here we go!

<sudokode>	henry_jia_t60: swapon -s
<d_garbage>	party like its 1999
<sudokode>	or do you mean telling it swap is encrypted?
<tomty89>	btw write your fstab, don't generate
<henry_jia_t60>	well i generate it with genfstab then i check it
<sudokode>	or at least generate it and then modify it
<muchweb>	demize: there is number of rc scripts kindly preserved by tz86 https://bitbucket.org/tz86/arch-rcscripts/src

<sudokode>	!next
<phrik>	another satisfied customer! next!
<bfrizzle>	hey, can anyone shed some light on the differences between directives in /etc/modprobe.d and /usr/lib/modprobe.d? after installing the 'official' nvidia driver, i see the blacklist entry for nouveau placed in /usr/lib/modprobe.d, but in order to actually blacklist nouveau, i had to manually create one in /etc/modprobe.d.
<tomty89>	hmm
<bfrizzle>	i checked mkinitcpio configs, both directories are sourced by the build hook
<grawity>	they're equivalent
<tomty89>	probably just the order?
<grawity>	except /usr is generally the package manager's area, while /etc is the admin's
<bfrizzle>	right, so i like that the nvidia package places its entries in the /usr area
<d_garbage>	/usr/lib for packages /etc for, meh too slow :p
<bfrizzle>	i just can't figure out why the blacklist doesn't get respected
<tomty89>	that's kind of...interesting
<bfrizzle>	agree
<d_garbage>	bfrizzle, how do you know it isn't blacklisted?
<bfrizzle>	d_garbage: display manager does not start and the console has the nouveau framebuffer driver
<bfrizzle>	d_garbage: when i do the same with /etc/modprobe.d having the blacklist file, the display manager starts and tty1 looks like an ugly 80x25 terminal
<tomty89>	nomodeset successfully
<bfrizzle>	naturally, the complaint is that modprobe can't install nvidia because nouveau is loaded
<polyzen>	one needs to have cabal-install in order to compile cabal-install, apparently
<polyzen>	https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/cabal-install/
<phrik>	title: arch linux - cabal-install 1.22.2.0-1 (x86_64) (at www.archlinux.org)
<d_garbage>	bfrizzle, thanks, just wanted to clear that up
<bfrizzle>	d_garbage: no sweat
<earnestly>	polyzen: you can cabal install cabal-install
<d_garbage>	you'd be amazed at the crazy conclusions people can come to
<bfrizzle>	if i inspect the initramfs image, would it reveal anywhere in there what the resulting blacklist might be?
<bfrizzle>	it's a gzipped cpio file by default, right?

<hyo0301>	wow
<mrelendig>	would be nice if ghc was better at cross compiling
<d_garbage>	bfrizzle, somehow this initramfs thing doesn't sound right at all
<hyo0301>	why doesn't grub start?!?!?!
<polyzen>	:\
<bfrizzle>	d_garbage: agree
<bfrizzle>	d_garbage: let me experiment again, sec
<benzrf>	please, please help
<benzrf>	if i go to vt1 i get just a completely blank screen
<benzrf>	off, i think. no backlight
<tomty89>	what chip
<d_garbage>	bfrizzle, eg i built mine when i was using nvidia, switched to nouveau and back just fine without rebuilding it, just rebooting
<polyzen>	benzrf, so we can assume that you need whatever was open
<polyzen>	benzrf, you chould check top or something to see what state x is in
<benzrf>	idk
<benzrf>	how do i see state
<godginrai>	hyo0301: are you doing an install?
<benzrf>	ah , s
<benzrf>	status is s
<bfrizzle>	d_garbage: hm, you didn't need to regen the initramfs?
<godginrai>	charlesatum: tried out thefuck yet?
<benzrf>	if i click on things it works fine, i think
<d_garbage>	bfrizzle, nope not at all
<benzrf>	i believe the screen arrangement just got fucked up
<tomty89>	bfrizzle: did you included nouveau in the initramfs?
<d_garbage>	bfrizzle, i wasn't aware it had anything to do with it
<benzrf>	i tried "xrander --output lvds-1" but it doesnt seem to help?
<tomty89>	bfrizzle: lile in the module array?
<hyo0301>	godginrai: yes! now i can't even doa arch-chroot /mnt
<hyo0301>	i get "can't find  /mnt in /etc/fstab
<charlesatum>	godginrai: not on important commands yet
<bfrizzle>	tomty89: i extracted the initramfs and no, no nouveau in here
<godginrai>	hyo0301: when you installed grub, did you remember to grub-mkconfig?
<godginrai>	charlesatum: i see
<tomty89>	bfrizzle: you don't need to extract btw, lsinitcpio
<bfrizzle>	tomty89: it also shows both blacklist directives, one from /etc/modprobe.d and one from /usr/lib/modprobe.d
<bfrizzle>	tomty89: oh, i just did gunzip -c bleh | cpio -idmv
<hyo0301>	godginrai: yes
<bfrizzle>	such that i could grep around
<godginrai>	hyo0301: so what are you seeing when you try to boot?
<tomty89>	bfrizzle: is it a laptop?
<hyo0301>	i get the normal root@archiso
<tomty89>	bfrizzle: or rather, does it have intel gfx as well?
<hyo0301>	it doesn't even ask me for root pass
<hyo0301>	i've done this reinstallation like 5 times
<bfrizzle>	tomty89: it is, but i disabled optimus
<godginrai>	hyo0301: did you try booting w/o the disc in?
<bfrizzle>	tomty89: like i said, i didn't have to do this when i was using linux-ck and nvidia-ck, it's a brand new bag
<hyo0301>	godginrai:  i'm doing vm
<d_garbage>	unmount it from the vm then
<godginrai>	^ this
<d_garbage>	bfrizzle, why aren't you using nvidia-ck bt the way?
<d_garbage>	by*
<hyo0301>	oh god..
<dunp>	hmm how to make gpsd working with gnome-maps?
<bfrizzle>	d_garbage: my office neighbor and i have both started to get inexplicable kernel panics on the latest ck kernel which we don't get from the mainline kernel
<bfrizzle>	d_garbage: i prefer ck, no question
<hyo0301>	d_garbage: is a god
<belak>	has anyone here gotten arch to play well with the latest vmware fusion? the open-vm-tools don't seem to handle auto-resizing or clipboard like they say they do
<earnestly>	bfrizzle: zen kernel uses bfq, fwiw
<bu5hm4n>	if one of you starts a dbus inspector, navigates to udisk2 block devices and clicks mount, is it working for you ?
<bfrizzle>	earnestly: ooh, nice - good to know, thank you
<dunp>	gpsmon get coordinates but gnome-map locatition does not work :(
<godginrai>	hyo0301: so unmounting the disc solved your problem?
<d_garbage>	bfrizzle, that was happening on the 4x version, it got downgraded back to 3x you know about that?
<bfrizzle>	d_garbage: yeah, i saw it was back to 3.19 this morning actually
<bfrizzle>	maybe it's worth the downgrade
<bfrizzle>	earnestly: any preference for zen over ck?
<d_garbage>	bfrizzle, see the comments on the aur page if you're using the repo
<hyo0301>	godginrai: yup
<godginrai>	hyo0301: good to hear
<godginrai>	!next
<phrik>	another satisfied customer! next!
<hyo0301>	wait!
<godginrai>	lol
<tomty89>	bfrizzle: does it work if you remove the conf file in /lib/modprobe.d?
<godginrai>	!prev
<phrik>	another unsatisfied customer! prev!
<bfrizzle>	tomty89: trying again
<tomty89>	bfrizzle: like not having both, but only the one in etc
<tomty89>	bfrizzle: rebuild image for every test btw
<hyo0301>	i need a wiki on what to do next, this only showed me how to get to root thingy, i don't have a de o_o
<d_garbage>	hyo0301, no, i just aparently have a memorable name
<benzrf>	it keeps saying 'configure crtc 0 failed'
<benzrf>	wtf
<godginrai>	hyo0301: you get a de or wm by installing it through pacman.  what de are you interested in using?
<tomty89>	bu5hm4n: printenv | grep -i dbus
<hyo0301>	is unix a de? xd
<godginrai>	no, unix is an os/kernel
<godginrai>	des are things like gnome, kde, etc.
<earnestly>	in a loose sense anything that consitutes an environment that is also your desktop is a de
<d_garbage>	hyo0301, then (if you did all the basic config) next step xorg on the wiki
<godginrai>	wms are things like i3, awesome, fluxbox, etc.
<tomty89>	!g unix tm
<phrik>	tomty89: politically correct unix(tm) - meyerweb: <http://meyerweb.com/other/humor/pcunix.html>
<bfrizzle>	tomty89: right, have been
<earnestly>	godginrai: which are also environments you use on a desktop
<bfrizzle>	tomty89: one sec, will tell you
<earnestly>	it's vague and a mostly useless terminology imo
<godginrai>	earnestly: sure, if you go by the straight definition of the separate words.
<hyo0301>	oh god i love you godginrai, this spoonfeed <3
<tomty89>	my i3 de
<hyo0301>	i'll use i3 as wm
<godginrai>	!give hyo0301 wiki i3
<benzrf>	please hhelp q_q
<phrik>	hyo0301: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/i3
<earnestly>	!i3
<phrik>	the i3 window manager: <http://i3wm.org/> i3 user guide: <http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html>
<tomty89>	or my i3-wm/i3status/dmenu de
<godginrai>	that should help with installation
<godginrai>	and setup
<hyo0301>	and gnome de
<benzrf>	xrandr keeps saying 'configure crtc 0 failed' with no other information
<benzrf>	i am trying to do xrandr --output lvds-1 --auto
<tomty89>	benzrf: where do you run xrandr? in a tty?
<benzrf>	yes
<tomty89>	sigh
<benzrf>	:|
<bfrizzle>	tomty89: it is entirely possible that i forgot to mkinitcpio after reinstalling nvidia, but i do not believe that was the case
<bfrizzle>	since using ck i religiously mkinitcpio after touching anything nvidia
<benzrf>	tomty89: i am running it in a tty because x is failing to show anything on screen
<tomty89>	benzrf: well it reveals that you can see a tty though
<benzrf>	so
<benzrf>	do i need to be in vt1 when it runs?
<benzrf>	or what
<benzrf>	i dont know how this works >.>
<tomty89>	benzrf: so nomodeset is not what you need
<tomty89>	benzrf: and check xorg log or journal for your display manager
<benzrf>	dont know what that is :|
<benzrf>	*what nomodeset is
<hyo0301>	i kind of feel like installing arch to my windows 7, and dualboot (dont want my w7 files to be deleted) is it possible?
<benzrf>	where's the xorg logs
<tomty89>	benzrf: nvm learn it later
<benzrf>	aha
<eyche>	how does gtk2 lookup it's wm_icon? is it different from how gtk3 and qt does it?
<benzrf>	yep it logs some resizes
<benzrf>	hmm, no more since a little while ago though
<benzrf>	caching?
<quicken2k>	quit
<benzrf>	augh maybe i'll just reboot
<benzrf>	n_n
<benzrf>	jesus it's 1:38 already
<benzrf>	what a goddamn waste of time

<eyche>	how does one find out what may be causing this?
<hyo0301>	what's the nano command to grab and move current line?
<eyche>	hyo0301: c-k c-u
<d_garbage>	hyo0301, there's a nice editor with menus called mcedit in the 'mc' package :)
<d_garbage>	i often mention it because no-one else ever does }:]
<hyo0301>	i prefer vim, but i'm just using nano now to set my mirrorlist
<hyo0301>	or doesn't nano work as a editor for those files?
<d_garbage>	ah, well you're fine then
<hyo0301>	vim*
<hyo0301>	aight
<tigrmesh>	vodik, wasamasa - it's been set that channels can be blacklisted.  it's up to rasi to admin as he sees fit
<d_garbage>	nano does deafult to wrapping long lines though ( -w to disable)
<godginrai>	hyo0301: base comes with vi
<tigrmesh>	vodik, wasamasa - quotegrabs can be blacklisted on a per-channel basis
<eyche>	is there a package that configures xdg_data_dirs?
<earnestly>	eyche: no

<earnestly>	eyche:
<earnestly>	oh right
<godginrai>	?
<earnestly>	eyche: this might help http://sprunge.us/ujgd?rst
<earnestly>	godginrai: was stuck in a mode
<godginrai>	ah
<hyo0301>	godginrai: thanks
<ox33>	did systemctl enable always require authentication?
<godginrai>	hyo0301: yw
<eyche>	earnestly: thanks, i'll take a look
<sheep>	ox33: are you running it as root?
<hyo0301>	godginrai:  do i need to install my default video driver to it or vesa (because oracle)
<godginrai>	ox33: depending on what you are doing, yes, iirc
<earnestly>	eyche: nothing sets them, fallbacks are well defined instead
<ox33>	sheep: no.
<godginrai>	hyo0301: never installed in a vm before, so i don't know the answer to that one.
<sheep>	ox33: that's probably why
<ox33>	i see.
<d_garbage>	hyo0301, vms usually have their own?
<godginrai>	ox33: oh wait, systemctl "enable".  i thought you just asked about systemctl xd
<d_garbage>	hyo0301, i think there's a separate article(s) on the wiki for archlinux guests
<hyo0301>	oh ok
<ox33>	could someone give me that list of good paste services via phrik please? (can i see a list of things phrik can give somewhere?)
<d_garbage>	!pastebins
<phrik>	some good, sane pastebins are: ptpb.pw, bpaste.net, gist.github.com, sprunge.us, ix.io, pastie.org, codepad.org
<hyo0301>	d_garbage: "enter a selection (default=all): #
<hyo0301>	which number is default? 0?
<sheep>	the default is 'all'
<quicken2k>	trying to install a program via yaourt when i get to the edit package build question i see no and it says makepkg: invalid option '--asroot'
<d_garbage>	enter
<godginrai>	hyo0301: default is hitting enter without making a selection
<ox33>	where is the list of things that phrik can output? i am querying phrik and typed help, but 'pastebins' is not listed as a plugin. i dont really understand irc yet
<vodik>	hyo0301: 'default=all', you can literally type in 'all'
<sheep>	quicken2k: correct. makepkg does not have an --asroot option anumore
<sheep>	*aymore
<sheep>	**anymore (i cannot type.)
<hyo0301>	lmao thanks! xd
<godginrai>	hyo0301: hence "default"
<quicken2k>	i'm not using it nor  am i root
<vodik>	hyo0301: its accepts comma seperated set of numbers, ranges, and 'all'
<sledgehammer>	quicken2k, ... yaourt calls makepkg
<quicken2k>	so how do i fix it?
<hyo0301>	vodik: thanks :o
<godginrai>	quicken2k: you are not, but obviously yaourt is trying to
<vodik>	quicken2k: are you sudoing yaourt?
<quicken2k>	yes
<vodik>	quicken2k: don't
<junka>	networkmanager 1.0.2 :o
<pid1>	well...
<hyo0301>	xorg, i3, gnome, xterm, anything else needed?
<vodik>	quicken2k: it knows when it has to sudo itself internally
<seylerius>	it really does.
<vodik>	quicken2k: which avoids the makepkg as root problem
<godginrai>	hyo0301: that really depends on what you want.
<seylerius>	it asks for sudo automatically, and only does so when absolutely necessary.
<henry_jia_t60>	hey guys, how do i make dm-crypt automatically request passphrase to unlock my homefolder on startup?
<hyo0301>	godginrai: i just want the default files to start my de, then install things like vim, python, ncmcmcpp and other terminal stuff when i'm in
<henry_jia_t60>	i don't want to store my passphrase on my system in the crypttab file because that makes the whole procedure slighly pointless
<godginrai>	that's one thing i like about aura.  it builds as user even if you sudo it
<quicken2k>	thx
<godginrai>	hyo0301: well, i've never messed with gnome or i3, so i would check the respective wiki pages for them for any details in install to get it to work the way you expect it to
<bakednotfried>	henry_jia_t60 use none or - instead of the passphrase
<godginrai>	hyo0301: never messed with them on arch, that is
<godginrai>	i've used gnome elsewhere
<henry_jia_t60>	bakednotfried: ok
<l3iggs>	does anyone know if arch officially supports running the os in a docker container?
<sheep>	there's no official stance on using arch with docker
<hyo0301>	godginrai: just want it to look like this, https://u.teknik.io/tdtwe2.png
<sheep>	i don't see why it wouldn't be possible
<lmat>	i'm trying to install pepper-flash. i followed the instructions at https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/chromium#flash_player_plugin until "enable the plugin..." which is not possible because the plugin isn't in the list :-(
<phrik>	title: chromium - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<hyo0301>	if you are here scammer, god bless you
<l3iggs>	it's totally possible
<l3iggs>	and most of the time it works great
<gamy>	i have a l44 notebook with realtek wireless network adapter (rtl8192ee) - now i have the problem that the network sometimes disconnects and wont reconnect, then i have to restart the wpa_supplicant service.
<antiatom>	hi all, i am trying to install armory from aur, but i receive a compilation error: https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8832549
<phrik>	title: mozilla pastebin - collaborative debugging tool (at pastebin.mozilla.org)
<braindamage>	vodik: i'm trying envoy, but i'm having some issues, how can i pass gnupghome env var? it seems to ignore it, even if i edit manually the systemd service file
<l3iggs>	i just found a bug when using arch in a container and i wonder who i should report it to
<d_garbage>	antiatom, lang=c infront of command for english output
<lmat>	i have installed from the aur before, but only once. i follow the instructions at https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/arch_user_repository#installing_packages  and didn't get any errors.
<phrik>	title: arch user repository - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<henry_jia_t60>	thanks bakednotfried, worked like a charm
<d_garbage>	antiatom, also pastebin.com is rubbish
<d_garbage>	!pastebins
<l3iggs>	if arch "officially" supported docker then it's obvious it should be reported to the arch package maintiner
<phrik>	some good, sane pastebins are: ptpb.pw, bpaste.net, gist.github.com, sprunge.us, ix.io, pastie.org, codepad.org
<lmat>	pacman -qs pepper; returns "local/chromium-pepper-flash...google chrome's pepper flash plugin..."
<godginrai>	hyo0301: that should be possible, but it will take some effort on your part to figure out how that user did that. ;)
<gamy>	any ideas how i could fix that?
<l3iggs>	and i do think the problem is really with the arch packaging
<hyo0301>	!help
<phrik>	hyo0301: help [<plugin>] [<command>]
<l3iggs>	but it seems i'm getting "f-off, we don't care if your shit doesn't work in docker"
<antiatom>	d_garbage: that is not pastebin.com ... reruning with lang=c
<godginrai>	l3iggs: arch supports *using* docker, not running arch *in* docker.
<lmat>	ah, maybe restart!
<lmat>	brb
<l3iggs>	yeah, pitty
<sheep>	in theory you can run arch in docker, but arch doesn't officially support it
<sheep>	(also, it's spelled 'pity')
<godginrai>	l3iggs: you are likely to run into tons of problems trying to run arch as a docker container, since arch uses systemd, and docker doesn't play nice with systemd in its containers
<l3iggs>	yep. that's the issue
<l3iggs>	although it's trivial fix in this case
<d_garbage>	antiatom, oops no it isn't. heh, sorry that's practically a reflex by now
<hyo0301>	ehm are mirrors in pacman.d working?
<sheep>	hyo0301: did you uncomment one or two of the mirrors in /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist?
<hyo0301>	i'm getting "error: failed retrieving file 'file_name'  from mirror
<godginrai>	l3iggs: yea, that's not an arch issue.  that's a known docker issue.  you should speak to either docker or systemd people about it.
<d_garbage>	lmat, did you remember to install it after building it? sometimes people forget that step if not using the -i flag
<sheep>	hyo0301: you may need to run pacman -syyu
<hyo0301>	i uncommented every mirror that was in my country
<gamy>	i have a l44 notebook with realtek wireless network adapter (rtl8192ee) - now i have the problem that the network sometimes disconnects and wont reconnect, then i have to restart the wpa_supplicant service. any ideas how to fix that?
<sheep>	you only need to have one or two uncommented
<hyo0301>	oh god
<gamy>	lenovo l440*
<godginrai>	l3iggs: wait, you have fixed it?  if you have gotten systemd running correctly in your docker image, i think tons of people would be happy.
<lmat>	d_garbage: i didn't at first, but yes, i did!
<d_garbage>	hyo0301, pacman uses the first mirror it can connect to, whether it's good or not
<hyo0301>	but if i have 5 of them?
<d_garbage>	hyo0301, if it can't connect it uses the next one down
<lmat>	d_garbage: i used   pacman -u  chromium...pkg.tar.gz
<l3iggs>	i'm just bummed, since it would be extremely easy for arch to fix, but i don't see systemd fully running in docker any time soon
<hyo0301>	oh so it's no problem then
<lmat>	d_garbage: and i said earlier...
<lmat>	pacman -qs pepper; returns "local/chromium-pepper-flash...google chrome's pepper flash plugin..."
<lmat>	which i think means that it successfully installed ^_^
<d_garbage>	lmat, restarted chromium?
<l3iggs>	godginrai: no. i don't have systemd working in docker
<lmat>	d_garbage: just restarted the whole computer !!
<godginrai>	l3iggs: ah
<lmat>	d_garbage: and yes, restarted chromium ;-)
<d_garbage>	lmat, yes, but usually -q or -qi rather than -qs
<godginrai>	l3iggs: then what does your "fix" fix?
<sheep>	and how would arch fix it?
<antiatom>	d_garbage: wow, just running with lang=c made the compilation complete without error
<d_garbage>	antiatom, o.o
<lmat>	d_garbage: both of those return expected results, too
<d_garbage>	antiatom, locale issue?
<sheep>	antiatom: that's really weird.  i noticed that there was a mix of spanish and french in it
<antiatom>	sounds like it, although i am not sure how to troubleshoot that
<d_garbage>	!give antiatom chklocale
<phrik>	antiatom: diagnose locale issues by running the following bash script: <http://git.io/q_henq>
<l3iggs>	the issue is that an install script in the package calls a systemd binary as part of its setup (for my use case i don't care if this bit of the install works) i just wish the install script checked to see if the binary exists before calling it
<vodik>	braindamage: must be used inside the user session then
<sheep>	l3iggs: do you know which package it is?
<d_garbage>	lmat, well yes they would
<lmat>	d_garbage: i'm wondering if, since i installed the plugin as root, and run the browser as me, it's not able to locate?
<l3iggs>	mariadb
<vodik>	braindamage: and that is... uh... half supported atm
<sheep>	huh
<vodik>	braindamage: the problem there is with operating a session dbus inside a systemd user session
<vodik>	braindamage: the wiki details it, and thats a dependanciy for it
<sheep>	it looks like it just calls systemd-tmpfiles
<l3iggs>	i have a ticket in the bug system. but i'm not really getting anywhere with it i think: https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/44862
<phrik>	title: fs#44862 : mariadb does not depend on systemd but the install script calls systemd-tmpfiles (at bugs.archlinux.org)
<d_garbage>	lmat, no that's how it works
<l3iggs>	sheep: yep, exactly
<l3iggs>	i would be a happy camper if that install script only called systemd-tmpfiles if it exists
<braindamage>	vodik: thanks, also, did i miss it, or does it not spawn the scdaemon either?
<sheep>	the assumption with arch is that you have systemd installed, though that doesn't necessarily mean that you run systemd
<hyo0301>	is gdm  a wm?
<vodik>	braindamage: i launch it like this: https://github.com/vodik/envoy/blob/master/src/agents.c#l37
<lmat>	d_garbage: :(
<phrik>	title: envoy/agents.c at master · vodik/envoy · github (at github.com)
<sheep>	hyo0301: no, it's a display manager (or login manager)
<vodik>	braindamage: the official instructions is to control scdaemon via your config files
<vodik>	braindamage: so it shouldn't be suppressed if your using it
<hyo0301>	ohok
<hyo0301>	600mb? why this huge size
<braindamage>	vodik: ok, thanks
<sheep>	hyo0301: what are you installing?
<lmat>	no errors, no nothin...frustrating :(
<henry_jia_t60>	hey guys, i have a laptop that has an intel hd3000 and a amd 6300m, do i install the hybrid drviers or the normal amd and itnel gpu drivers?
<henry_jia_t60>	it's switchable graphics, but i'm not sure if that's same as hybrid
<d_garbage>	lmat, /usr/lib/pepperflash/libpepflashplayer.so exists?
<hyo0301>	sheep:  gdm
<hyo0301>	sheep:  pacman -s gdm
<sheep>	hyo0301: that's because it depends on most of gnome
<lmat>	d_garbage: yes! (thanks for asking ^_^)
<vodik>	braindamage: running it under a systemd user session should become a lot more stable after kdbus/systemd-bus stuff lands. atm the session dbus and systemd --user needs some effort to setup
<hyo0301>	what are you using sheep ?
<hyo0301>	dm, de and wm?
<lmat>	d_garbage: maybe i should strace chromium? ^_^
<sheep>	lightdm with i3
<grawity>	vodik: afaik the next dbus release will officially have 'user' vs 'session' as a compile time option
<lmat>	woha!
<braindamage>	vodik: arch explicitly disables the systemd side of kdbus atm ( and yeah, i know kernel's side is in a limbo atm )
<lmat>	d_garbage: i see it in chrome://plugins!   (i ran it from the console instead of the keyboard shortcut.)
<bosyi>	hi. i'm confused. tell me please: if my touchpad have option of two finger scroll and if it enabled it works, two finger tap should work too?
<vodik>	grawity: yeah, but this is, afaik, a problem with the semantics of 'session' vs 'user'
<hyo0301>	show your desktop sheep
<sheep>	hyo0301: it's literally all black
<vodik>	session dbus is a compromise since you can't really do a 'user' dbus just yet
<d_garbage>	lmat, grats
<junka>	!lmat
<sheep>	hyo0301: go look up a screenshot of i3.  i just use the default color scheme
<antiatom>	ok so i found my locale errors... apparently i do not have lang set and i am not sure why
<lmat>	d_garbage: yup, verified: using the keyboard shortcut, the plugin is not available :'-(
<vodik>	which is coming with systemd, just like it now handles the system dbus
<shardish>	gamy: i had huge problems with that network card as well. there are a bunch of different drivers available both on the aur and git repo's in general - i'm pretty sure i tried them all and didn't ever get a satisfactory outcome. i ended up just buying an el' cheapo netgear dongle in the end which works so much better.
<lmat>	junka: yo
<sheep>	antiatom: is there anything in /etc/locale.conf ?
<antiatom>	problem: terminal and its parent have different locale settings.
<grawity>	vodik: what's preventing it so far?
<vodik>	braindamage: well its not upstreamed so far
<d_garbage>	junka, /query phrik and test things in there to avoid embarrasment and or spam
<shardish>	gamy: it has the advantage of not being under my left wrist (knocking off a couple of dbs of signal :d)
<antiatom>	sheep: yes but it is different than my locale  lang=en_us.utf-8
<junka>	d_garbage; >_>
<vodik>	grawity: things break last time i tried it explictly
<d_garbage>	lmat, what keyboard shortcut its this?
<grawity>	hmm
<vodik>	grawity: like gnome-terminal refused to run
<d_garbage>	is*
<antiatom>	my locale should be fr_fr.utf-8
<lmat>	d_garbage: i use xfce. i created a keyboard shortcut to open chromium...let me see exactly what it's running there
<vodik>	grawity: and i had to hack startx to not unset dbus socket environment stuff
<d_garbage>	lmat, indeed
<sheep>	antiatom: did you uncomment that in /etc/locale.gen?
<grawity>	ah, gnome-terminal requires that dbus-daemon know $display etc.
<vodik>	ah that makes sense
<grawity>	it works like urxvtd
<gamy>	shardish: well... not really satisfying :x but thanks for the information about all the aur drivers! tested 2 so far and they made everything worse...
<grawity>	all windows displayed by the dbus-activated service
<lmat>	d_garbage: the shortcut was running /usr/lib/chromium/chromium;  :-( i changed to /usr/bin/chromium
<d_garbage>	:)
<shardish>	gamy: lemme see if i can find the one that worked best.
<vodik>	grawity: anyways, i don't know any of this for sure but its the sense i get from the vauge plans for dbus in the future
<antiatom>	sheep: no, looks like they are both uncommented
<vodik>	and the posts i read i don't have bookmarked
<sheep>	weird
<grawity>	vodik: well, many gnome apps are moving to the "dbus-activated" model
<grawity>	vodik: so i'm sure they'll figure out how to make it work sometime soon
<antiatom>	sheep: i mean yes in that case
<vodik>	yeah
<antiatom>	both en_us and fr_fr are uncommented
<sheep>	that's strange
<grawity>	en_us which
<grawity>	there are several en_us lines
<grawity>	one with utf-8, one without
<eyche>	how do gtk2 apps figure out what icon to use in tasklist in conjunction with the gtk-icon-theme-name
<antiatom>	sheep: grawity actually i have other locales uncommented in locale.gen  but they are all utf-8 lines
<antiatom>	here is the output of the locale checking script sheep linked  https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8832553
<phrik>	title: mozilla pastebin - collaborative debugging tool (at pastebin.mozilla.org)
<sheep>	i didn't link that
<antiatom>	oh sorry, i dont remember who did
<hyo0301>	kde, xfce or gnome?!
<sheep>	hyo0301: they all suck
<hyo0301>	what do i need then
<sheep>	whatever works best for you
<hyo0301>	i want to get on rtorrent, mpv and watch anime so badly
<hyo0301>	well i don't know the difference, so i don't know what's best
<sheep>	those will work regardless of the de or wm you use, as long as you're using one
<bakednotfried>	hyo0301 just use awesome
<sheep>	awesome takes awhile to configure
<shardish>	gamy: i can't remember sorry. i don't have access to the laptop that has it installed at the moment either. it may have been from this repo:  https://github.com/lwfinger/rtlwifi_new

<eyche>	i can't seem to get my gtk2 icons to appear correctly in awesome :-(
<hyo0301>	sheep: https://i.4cdn.org/g/1430847891812.png if i want it to look like this, with a menubar at top, what de?!
<gamy>	thank you shardish
<sheep>	hyo0301: all of them let you put a menu at the top
<eyche>	hyo0301: i recommend bspwm w/ bar if you want it to look like that
<hyo0301>	ok ....
<shardish>	gamy: no probs. if you can spare £8 on the basic netgear microdongle, it'll probably save you quite a bit of time :d
<hyo0301>	bu what about de?
<hyo0301>	i'm going to use i3 cause it's installed, not going through the trouble of chaning '-'
<sheep>	gnome and kde are probably the ones that are the most developed, but they're also really big

<phrik>	sheep: yay, aur.archlinux.org is up. // isitup.org
<leonw>	or is some issue on my connection
<leonw>	thanks
<hyo0301>	ok then i'm going for xfce
<grazzolini>	any user of chkboot or chkboot-git here?
<lmat>	hyo0301: i just started using xfce a couple days ago. it strikes me as a no-nonsense lightweight environment.
<grazzolini>	any user of chkboot or chkboot-git here?
<namarrgon>	!give grazzolini ask
<phrik>	grazzolini: don't ask to ask, if anyone is here or alive, or uses something. just ask, and we'll get moving along. thanks.
<grazzolini>	namarrgon: i don't have a problem with it
<hyo0301>	lmat: is it newbiefriendly?
<cydrobolt>	lmat, xfce is quite simple, but it does get buggy when lots of windows and workspaces start to get put in
<cydrobolt>	i personally use gnome, which handles workspaces and windows much better :)
<grazzolini>	namarrgon: just to inform that the chkboot-git was merged into chkboot
<cydrobolt>	it's often a matter of preference, though
<hyo0301>	i'm so damn bad at linux it's sick
<godginrai>	hyo0301: you'll learn over time
<namarrgon>	grazzolini: irc is probably the worst place for that announcement
<aaronm04>	yes, namarrgon is correct
<grazzolini>	namarrgon: but it's also one place for that
<grazzolini>	namarrgon: i will post it on bbs also
<aaronm04>	ah good :)
<namarrgon>	grazzolini: do you need the upgrade-message in post_install() ?
<eyche>	are gtk2 apps aware of icon-theme?
<arch-tk>	this is so cringeworthy
<arch-tk>	breaking bad would be better if walt was less shit at lying and hiding his feelings.
<godginrai>	arch-tk: then his name probably wouldn't fit
<sheep>	arch-tk: how far into it are you?
<earnestly>	(that show died when he refused a good job and full cover with no strings attached because lolpride)
<arch-tk>	sheep: currently s04e08
<sheep>	ah
<arch-tk>	he looks so incredibly fucking stressed it's like he's about to cry whenever things get hot, and then he acts like a badass at other times, it's really offputting.
<hyo0301>	error occured, no packages were upgraded
<seylerius>	hyo0301: look a line or three up, see what the error was.
<henry_jia_t60>	guys, which pacakge is the glxinfo command in?
<g00ey>	anyone know if there is a way to cycle only through current desktop using ctrl + tab in openbox?
<g00ey>	by current desktop i mean monitor
<namarrgon>	!give henry_jia_t60 pkgfile
<phrik>	henry_jia_t60: pkgfile is a tool to find out what package owns a file, even if said package is not installed. pacman -s pkgfile; pkgfile -u
<henry_jia_t60>	ok, thanks namarrgon

<wasamasa>	earnestly: but hey, its simpler than reinventing a safe method of serializing data to a file
<arch-tk>	earnestly: that's what i was thinking of doing.
<earnestly>	wasamasa: open(..., o_append);
<bwmaker>	hey everyone. i'm trying to install python 2 packages using pip, but can't figure it out. i read about pip2, but i don't seem to have that as an available command, although python2 and python2-pip are installed. thoughts?
<earnestly>	wasamasa: also, s/simpler/easier
<wasamasa>	earnestly: oh, right
<earnestly>	wasamasa: also, it's not hard if you want the reduced dependencies and performance
<earnestly>	i mean, it's not a big cost
<albertocg>	#join #hackernews
<albertocg>	oops
<wasamasa>	i'm currently using it for a web application that periodically fetches data from somewhere else, stores new data in a database and can be queried to get a list of the last n items for turning these into an atom feed
<lezkus>	anyone...? :/
<cirrus_minor>	bwmaker ➤   try installing python-pip too
<wasamasa>	which feels better to me than reinventing this with json or whatever
<earnestly>	web "applications" are a different breed of problem
<earnestly>	because you're limited quite severely to a fairly poor set of tools
<max-p>	hi, anyone know an easy way to copy a gpt table structure to a new *smaller* disk? sgdisk just straight up refuses to write the table, and i can't find a way to load the backup gpt (from file) and move the problematic partitions
<pid1>	i just switched over to i3 from xfce. previously, i was using gnome keyring for wireless keyring/ssh keys/etc. it looks like i can use that the same under i3. is there something else i should look into, or would gnome keyring be sufficient?
<wasamasa>	it works out well since there's a single writer at most in relatively rare intervals and a few readers maybe
<vodik>	thats sqlites best case
<bwmaker>	cirrus_minor: thanks, but that was already installed. i reinstalled it for good measure, but still no luck.
<earnestly>	a text file is also good at that
<vodik>	well, single writer, many readers
<bougyman>	lovin' this article: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9494310
<phrik>	title: a cursory look at meta-programming in nim | hacker news (at news.ycombinator.com)
<max-p>	basically, i dumped all partitions using dd and backed up the gpt with "sgdisk -b", and now i don't have the original disk anymore. i'm trying to restore it exactly like it was, and then move the last two partitions that causes problems. there's no data on the target drive
<earnestly>	bougyman: the article or the hackshit link?
<cirrus_minor>	bwmaker ➤    so you have python2-pip and python-pip installed ? what have you tried to install this pkg ?
<wasamasa>	arch-tk: i'm looking forward to your single-file, structural, smalldata database solution
<earnestly>	wasamasa: cf pacman
<arch-tk>	wasamasa: what?
<hyo0301>	failed to retrieve community.db, core.db, extra.db
<arch-tk>	wasamasa: i just need to store a list of uuids
<wasamasa>	arch-tk: an append-only file containing a series of structs at worst
<bougyman>	the article the link points to
<earnestly>	wasamasa: go figure out why kdb+ beats everything out there
<arch-tk>	wasamasa: what do you think i am writing?
<arch-tk>	the mother of all files?
<wasamasa>	arch-tk: i was just being sarcastic
<arch-tk>	wasamasa: i could write it in python and just json.dumps or whatever the fuck it's called to shove it into a file
<arch-tk>	wasamasa: i sort of caught that.
<bwmaker>	cirrus_minor: i've just now noticed a file conflict when trying to install python2-pip, so it may have not previously installed. apologies, i'll look into this further. thanks for your help!

<arch-tk>	earnestly: that must have been funny.
<vodik>	arch-tk: uuid's are fixed with, so just mmap some file at some multiple of 64 and it should work really nicely

<vodik>	arch-tk: especially if you write them in the order you'll process them without random access
<wasamasa>	earnestly: but yes, i am aware that relational databases shine when you have a curated set of facts you're going to query the hell out
<vodik>	or 128, can't remember how big they are
<b4x>	isn't a pacman -syu supposed to update the kernel too?
<arch-tk>	vodik: interesting idea
<vodik>	b4x: depends if there's an update
<earnestly>	wasamasa: it's really hard to do generically, evidently
<arch-tk>	vodik: what if i want to store a date for when the file was uploaded?
<b4x>	well i just noticed i'm still on 3.18
<b4x>	despite doing 3 updates since then
<wasamasa>	earnestly: i'm currently looking at alternative approaches people have thought out for everything else
<vodik>	arch-tk: 32 bytes for timestamp, 126 bytes for uuid
<earnestly>	wasamasa: if you know the offsets, you're basically solved half the problem :p
<wasamasa>	earnestly: like the columnar stores used for business analytics, all the key-value stores, etc.
<vodik>	arch-tk: and since its fixed width, you can always know where the next record should lie
<wasamasa>	earnestly: heck, even what really old computer systems used
<vodik>	*128
<wasamasa>	earnestly: where it was a header with information to calculate offsets and a single line of text
<earnestly>	wasamasa: they're often better purely because they were actually limited and had to think a bit more cleverly
<wasamasa>	earnestly: so that it was a matter of knowing the index and record size
<arch-tk>	vodik: now the uuid is just a string, but how do i deal with endianness, i'm really a noob to storing data "raw" or without serialising it into something readable first which means i don't have to worry about endianness.
<vodik>	arch-tk: probably can't get more cache friendly and minimal than that without some trickery
<earnestly>	wasamasa: that's basically how free stores work in memory allocators
<earnestly>	or free lists
<vodik>	arch-tk: why would endiness matter?
<earnestly>	utf-8 doesn't care about endiness \o/
<earnestly>	no bom for you
<bougyman>	i'm getting a fail on that aadrake link, earnestly
<arch-tk>	vodik: if i'm storing the timestamp in 32 bits i'm guessing you mean the unix timestamp, of course, endianness doesn't matter when just running on one machine but what if for some insane reason someone ported this to windows and (i'm not even sure if this would ever be the case) endianness becomes an issue?
<earnestly>	bougyman: loads here
<earnestly>	bougyman: mostly awk
<wasamasa>	earnestly: why doesn't that surprise me at all
<vodik>	arch-tk: then they'll have to read the bytes back in a different order. its not your problem
<arch-tk>	vodik: :p alright.
<earnestly>	wasamasa: because single threaded performance is *amazing*
<arch-tk>	vodik: thanks for your information
<earnestly>	wasamasa: and concurrent performance is almost always garbage

<wasamasa>	hyo0301: grab a better mirror
<hyo0301>	i uncommented every mirror
<arch-tk>	vodik: :p thanks, again
<wasamasa>	hyo0301: i recommend leaseweb/hosteurope
<hyo0301>	i get "could not resolve host"
<wasamasa>	hyo0301: also, make sure your internet connection works
<wasamasa>	hyo0301: pacman grabs the first one of that list...
<vodik>	arch-tk: its a little off the topic you asked about, but basically the second someone of a different endiness wants to read your timestamp, they'll have to add the logic to read the bytes in reverse order
<vodik>	arch-tk: define your database to be in your native endinesses, and it becomes the problem of other people to read your format :p
<sysgh0st>	if one specifies more than one mirror, won't pacman try with the next one in the list if the first fails?
<wasamasa>	vodik: so it's about endianness of the data (which matters) and endianness of the system (which doesn't matter)?
<arch-tk>	vodik: alright
<hyo0301>	how to ping in root?
<mzgnr>	hello people, i want to ask you a question. i'm about get hired by a company as a software engineer and its my first professional job :) . when i get my first sallary i want to buy a notebook/laptop which linux can run on it w/o issues. and i want it to be light and have long battery life. can you recommend any notebook or laptop for me ?
<hyo0301>	ping google.com doesn't work
<wasamasa>	hyo0301: what about pinging 8.8.8.8?
<vodik>	wasamasa: well, the article in this case is against trying to deal with endiness through byteswapping
<wasamasa>	!give mzgnr g thinkpad guide
<phrik>	mzgnr: used thinkpad buyers guide - ktgee.net: <http://ktgee.net/post/49423737148/thinkpad-guide>
<vodik>	never swap, just read bytes in the right order to begin with
<wasamasa>	mzgnr: grab a chinese battery if you wish
<arch-tk>	that guide is pretty good btw
<vodik>	in which case, arch-tk just needs to define his file format as 'write in little endiness' and the problem goes away :p
<arch-tk>	vodik: oh i see.
<arch-tk>	oh i see.
<sysgh0st>	japanese batteries > chinese ... but then... "batteries from anywhere else" > "chinese batteries".
<arch-tk>	that makes perfect sense.
<mzgnr>	wasamasa , arch-tk but i'm not living in u.s :/
<hyo0301>	wasamasa:  "network is not reachable"
<wasamasa>	mzgnr: doesn't matter, you'll get these on ebay or what-have-you
<arch-tk>	mzgnr: irrelevant, do some basic tax rate conversion
<wasamasa>	mzgnr: or discounted from shops for students
<wasamasa>	hyo0301: well, great, fix your internet connection
<hyo0301>	oh wait it works
<hyo0301>	i can ping 0.0.0.0
<thelemonman>	shipping fees are usually high as fuck
<mzgnr>	wasamasa , arch-tk so thinkpads are the best for linux ?
<wasamasa>	hyo0301: congrats on pinging yourself
<hyo0301>	._.
<arch-tk>	mzgnr: i'm currently using one now and every non-simply-mappable-magic-or-something-media-key-or-something works as intended with minimum tewaks.
<arch-tk>	tweaks*
<arch-tk>	mzgnr: so they're pretty good.
<hyo0301>	zzz but i could install other stuff damn
<arch-tk>	it's just sad that if i wanted to flash coreboot, i need a better isp
<wasamasa>	mzgnr: they're generally pretty nice no-nonsense laptops that you can get for relatively little money
<wasamasa>	mzgnr: and linux support is good
<mzgnr>	one more thing, first thanks for the thinkpad , but is it the only option. maybe just a little expensive ones, are there any ?
<wasamasa>	there's usually three problematic spots when it comes to hardware support for linux, gpus (only intel is unproblematic), wifi and on laptops the media keys
<arch-tk>	i think there's a local hackerspace, now i have no idea what a hackerspace is, but i hope they have a good isp so i might get in touch and get this thing flashed with coreboot.
<arch-tk>	with the stock firmware it takes 9.3 seconds to boot to the loader
<arch-tk>	apparently coreboot does a much better job than stock firmware
<wasamasa>	other than that support is pretty allright
<arch-tk>	apparently coreboot could get that down to under a second
<wasamasa>	and thinkpads happen to clear all these easily
<wasamasa>	and have matte screens and exterior
<arch-tk>	if i had sub-second firmware loading, i could boot this computer in less than 3.5 seconds.
<arch-tk>	if i could boot this computer in 3.5 seconds i would have a party.
<arch-tk>	you're all invited.
<wasamasa>	why is your isp a problem?
<mzgnr>	arch-tk: i can only join on skype
<arch-tk>	i have a shit isp, wrong voltage i think too.
<arch-tk>	well, an isp good enough for an avr
<arch-tk>	attiny
<crazedpsyc>	are you... not talking about the internet service provider sort of isp?
<arch-tk>	in system programmer
<crazedpsyc>	that makes more sense.
<mzgnr>	lol
<wasamasa>	oh
<braindamage>	avr are overpriced garbage tough
<braindamage>	and the debugger too
<arch-tk>	braindamage: what's cheaper?
<braindamage>	cortex m3
<braindamage>	most brands
<braindamage>	you can get 1$ chip with an m3 core, more periferials
<braindamage>	and an actual remote debugger bridge that doesn't cost 100$
<braindamage>	eg stm32
<braindamage>	( there's a cons to stm32 tough, the docs are full of erratas )
<braindamage>	howrever, there's plenty of other otptions, freescale, etc
<thelemonman>	freescale ones are the best, don't really know about their prices (or pricing models) though
<sudokode>	arch-tk: i'm about halfway done
<arch-tk>	sudokode: halfway done with what?
<sudokode>	the current stuff needs some tweaking but it's just a proof of concept
<john_f>	most of them push a $400 ide or cloud javascript stuff, at least stm32 has reasonable code examples for vim/gcc.
<sudokode>	arch-tk: https://ptpb.pw/qpnv

<sudokode>	:d
<sudokode>	why complicate it with sqlite
<arch-tk>	i wasn't going to
<arch-tk>	i wasn't going to use sqlite to begin with.
<thelemonman>	sprinkle some node.js on top
<arch-tk>	i told you why i wasn't because i know it's going to be slow.

<sudokode>	sweet fuckness
<arch-tk>	sudokode: i might write it in c.
<arch-tk>	sudokode: i was thinking something fancy.
<sudokode>	arch-tk: fuck off
<sudokode>	really?
<thelemonman>	node.js pwease
<arch-tk>	sudokode: a simple command line uploader with the option of a file or stdin using curl to upload.
<arch-tk>	sudokode: mmapped file (like vodik said) to store the uuids and a date
<sudokode>	why a date?
<arch-tk>	sudokode: so other than pulling the contents you can sort of work out what the fuck you pushed
<sudokode>	i dunno about you, but i don't remember what i upload at what time
<sudokode>	i found the sha1 useful though
<arch-tk>	sudokode: well anyway, for viewing, a simple ncurses list interface with a background thread which goes through a queue of urls to pull a small amount of text from the beginning of each upload to display it next to the date.
<sudokode>	if you wanna know if uploaded file foo or data bar, you just store the sha1 ptpb gives you
<arch-tk>	sudokode: and a simple, up/down with a few key strokes
<sudokode>	then when you call it with that file/data, it just hands you the url
<arch-tk>	i know how ptpb.pw works.
<sudokode>	wait, you're using ncurses now?
<sudokode>	you're fucking with me, right?
<sudokode>	is this guy fucking with me?
<arch-tk>	sudokode: :p
<arch-tk>	sudokode: "fancy"
<sudokode>	we just went full blown ftp
<sudokode>	winftp at that
<holomorph>	who you talkin' to
<sudokode>	:s
<sudokode>	holomorph: i'm shouting at the heavens
<holomorph>	alright
<sudokode>	like all the tortured minds of yesteryears
<arch-tk>	sudokode: oh go away, it's still simple, i've done a lot of ncurses in the past and i can probably fit this thing in under 500 lines.
<hyo0301>	can i put archlinux.iso file in :d (recovery) and boot it that way? ;)
<crazedpsyc>	no
<crazedpsyc>	it is not magical
<sudokode>	the :d was confusing
<crazedpsyc>	yeah
<sudokode>	is that supposed to be d:?
<crazedpsyc>	assuming so, since recovery
<crazedpsyc>	though if you put archlinux.iso in :d and boot it with unicorn extensible firmware interface, that would work
<arch-tk>	sudokode: anyone can write a small shitty uploader for ptpb.pw
<arch-tk>	sudokode: i want to write a small good uploader for ptpb.pw
<arch-tk>	one that actually provides helpful information.
<hyo0301>	lol
<crazedpsyc>	if only ptpb.pw had a user page like ix.io
<hyo0301>	finally time for some gnome :')
<crazedpsyc>	life would be good
<sudokode>	arch-tk: hater
<sudokode>	i like my small shitty scripts :(
<earnestly>	i can keep small shitty scripts in my head
<sudokode>	does your head have mouse support?
<earnestly>	limited
<crazedpsyc>	speaking of which, i need to make something like rodentbane work
<hyo0301>	earnestly:  do i need xorg?
<sudokode>	heh
<earnestly>	hyo0301: yes, you do need xorg if you want to use gnome.  the wayland backend is there too but not very stable apparently.
<hyo0301>	what do i need besides i3, lightdm and gnome?
<crazedpsyc>	not very pretty either
<earnestly>	hyo0301: gnome includes its own wm called mutter (based on clutter)
<earnestly>	although the 'm' prefix (for metacity) is ... gone now iirc
<arch-tk>	to be honest sudokode i can think of a better way of doing this
<hyo0301>	so i don't need anything besides gnome, i3, xorg and lightdm?
<cirrus_minor>	one mans 'shitty script' is another mans ...
<namarrgon>	only means of income?
<sudokode>	arch-tk: ?
<cirrus_minor>	dont need lightdm ( unless you want it) hyo0301
<prinsen>	does one need the vga arbiter patches for qemu with a nvidia gpu?
<arch-tk>	sudokode: just awk the output of the command straight into a file
<arch-tk>	sudokode: append
<arch-tk>	sudokode: then you cat the file
<steve>	is there any reason the infinality patches aren't in the main repositories or aur?
<braindamage>	they are in the aur
<sudokode>	arch-tk: cat the file where?
<arch-tk>	sudokode: curl -f "c=@-" https://ptpb.pw/|awk '/sha1:/{print $2}' >>uuids
<arch-tk>	sudokode: fixed
<namarrgon>	steve: they aren't upstream, arch doesn't like patching upstream
<sudokode>	sha1 isn't he uuid
<arch-tk>	long then?
<arch-tk>	whatever
<sudokode>	i like sha1 uuid url
<sudokode>	that way you always have the short url at next to no cost
<sudokode>	or does that url expire?
<steve>	namarrgon: i suppose my question is why doesn't arch make the patches versions easily available? i have never managed to get good looking fonts on arch without infinality but i hate adding repos, keys, etc - it feels more hacky than i'd like
<sudokode>	if so, just sha1 and uuid, then shorten the url upon request
<steve>	i will freely admit that fonts on linux have perplexed me for many years so i am grateful that infinality even exists :)
<brandiee>	 i hope you don't mind me asking such a simple question, but do you guys think that arch linux would be a good distribution to start ones linux endeavour on? it's not like i've never used linux before but i've never had it as my main operating system either.
<holomorph>	!whyarch
<phrik>	this might help you decide: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/faq#q.29_why_would_i_want_to_use_arch.3f
<sudokode>	arch-tk: that code was just written and obviously needs a lot of work
<cirrus_minor>	brandiee ➤   yes
<sudokode>	i just wanted to throw the basic functions together...ish
<sudokode>	i got distracted though so i quit :s
<brandiee>	i've looked at that page holomorph, but i'd like some "real user" input as well :)
<holomorph>	brandiee: short answer? no, not unless you actually want to and know why you want to
<arch-tk>	sudokode: anyway, i feel shitty today so i think i'll go get something to drink and fuck off to sleep.
<steve>	brandiee: yeah, what holomorph said. it depends if you want to spend your time learning linux or using linux. if the former, go for it... if the latter, use something easier
<arch-tk>	i'll write my thing tomorrow at lunch or something.
<namarrgon>	steve: perhaps you should look into how the font stack works, you'll see that it isn't that hard to get decent font-rendering  with the vanilla packages.
<sudokode>	mmk later
<cirrus_minor>	brandiee ➤    if you want to learn a bit about linux then id say yes, if not interested in learning just install <foo> and be happy
<steve>	namarrgon: thanks, i probably should - just need to make time. fontconfig seems to be the thing, but there's a lot of terminology and i don't know what problem i'm trying to solve
<steve>	namarrgon: i.e. i don't know why things are ugly like they are... confusing
<steve>	i dont like solutions i dont understand, but infinality at least fixes the problem quickly!
<brandiee>	steve, when, i'd really like to learn linux, i know how to use it. also, i'm in college for electric engineering so i'm destined to encounter linux at some point and understanding how an operating system works in detail would probably be of benefit.
<sudokode>	arch-tk: my solutions tend to be rather... primitive... https://ptpb.pw/4qhx
<steve>	brandiee: well, if you have time to fix things if/when they break, arch will probably reward your efforts
<steve>	brandiee: if you need a machine that works to browse, email, do skype, write reports - and you can't handle breakage - then avoid it
<arch-tk>	sudokode: stop putting yourself down, now i feel bad for you
<namarrgon>	btw, can i get ptpb/curl to only return the url instead of that long "report"?
<sudokode>	:d
<vodik>	arch-tk: what are you working on anyways?
<ox33>	hey, is someone using pdfsam? i just installed it from official repos, but it just displays a blank white screen when i start it. i use openjdk8
<arch-tk>	vodik: working on?
<brandiee>	steve, i can handle breakage, but i suppose if it's destined to break every time i open a new document then it might not be for me. how often/ what kind of breaks would i encounter compared to a more "user-friendly" distribution?
<vodik>	arch-tk: the thing you need uuids for
<junka>	i love arch, and arch loves me back <3
<arch-tk>	vodik: ptpb.pw uploader thingy
<vodik>	ah
<steve>	brandiee: it just takes some work to get things up & running, and if you don't know what you're doing then that's more prone to breakage. it's not intrinsicly more likely break, just that with things like ubuntu it comes already up & running
<steve>	brandiee: fwiw, i use both and my arch boxes are actually more stable than my ubuntu boxes on the whole (comparing apples / oranges)
<brandiee>	steve: so from what i gather, the initial investment is larger but the pay off later is greater, that is if you like high customisability and (potential?) stability?
<steve>	yeah, it *can* be greater anyway - because you get things as you want it
<earnestly>	vodik: seen ponylang yet?
<ox33>	holomorph: providing a friendly gui that doesnt require hours of reading man pages
<hexhaxtron>	how can i select text with touchpad?
<holomorph>	ox33: :d
<vodik>	earnestly: nope3000 e
<vodik>	woah
<vodik>	earnestly: nope
<vodik>	stupid laggy wifi link
<earnestly>	vodik: ponylang.org
<earnestly>	vodik: it's, actually somewhat interesting
<earnestly>	vodik: and has a mechanical proof of the type system, which you can read, using system f it seems
<earnestly>	vodik: the n-body code ran for me in 9.18s
<sarcasmrules>	oh deary me,  i was wondering why my usb drive wasn't showing up in lsblk until i realised that i had upgraded to kernel 4.0 and hadn't rebooted o.o
<steve>	brandiee: the arch community and wiki are the best in the linux world, imho, so in terms of support there's that
<earnestly>	vodik: the best c++ on shootout is 9.08s
<sarcasmrules>	hexhaxtron: tap twice, hold on the second tap and drag :)
<ox33>	holomorph: do you know another fast way of merging some pdf files?
<earnestly>	vodik: i'd try the shootout stuff locally but it segfaults :p
<sarcasmrules>	if you have your driver setup properly
<brandiee>	i noticed, i was looking around for support for my laptop (thinkpad yoga) and of course i found a arch specific fix :d
<d-mon>	after the upgrade of gdm to 3.14 to 3.16.x the xrandr "tweak" on the top of /etc/gdm/init/default has stopped working for me. anybody konw of a fix? i've commented in the waylandenable=false line in /etc/gdm/custom.conf https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/nvidia_optimus
<phrik>	title: nvidia optimus - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<holomorph>	ox33: nope, just ghostscript
<steve>	brandiee: :)
<brandiee>	which i might note, is the only fix i've found to date
<ox33>	holomorph: does that provide a gui?
<earnestly>	ox33: you can almost do it with vim but pdfs are so finicky that one might react normally and another will explode
<earnestly>	at last remaking it entirely in ghostscript results in a mostly good pdf
<brandiee>	so, if i decide to learn the arch way, which guides would you recommend, aside from the wiki's beginners guide?
<earnestly>	brandiee: i wouldn't recommend that one.  also forget about "the arch way" before it rots your brain
<steve>	brandiee: start with that then google what you need
<bwmaker>	brandiee: i'm relatively new to arch and i found the wiki to extremely helpful, so much so i've not really needed to look outside the wiki that often.
<sarcasmrules>	brandiee: just think of what you personally want to acheive, then look at the wiki pages for that. there's no one set way of doing stuff with your arch install
<earnestly>	brandiee: the install guide is good at least
<ox33>	man, i really envy some of you for your free time. i wish i had a couple of hours a week to read manpages instead of using a gui with no learning curve.
<holomorph>	the installation guide, which is the beginner's guide without the beginner stuff
<earnestly>	brandiee: just get used to reading manuals :p
<earnestly>	ox33: don't be an asshole
<earnestly>	ox33: e.g. https://github.com/earnestly/dotfiles/blob/master/.local/bin/ghostly#l158-l181

<sarcasmrules>	i've just run into a bit of a problem with my laptop's wifi which keeps disconnecting/reconnecting on me (broadcom bcm43142). i've put the log files here: http://pastebin.com/l1elcaxw any idea what went wrong?

<earnestly>	oh look, wl driver
<earnestly>	i'm shocked
<brandiee>	i'll be off to google then. thanks for the input. :)
<sarcasmrules>	earnestly: it's the only one that supports that chip :'(
<earnestly>	yeah, and that's why you're seeing what you're seeing
<earnestly>	it's sad, i feel sorry for you, really
<earnestly>	but there is almost literally nothing you can do as wl is closed source
<earnestly>	try get a nice atheros usb wnic instead perhaps?
<sarcasmrules>	i have a tiny usb wifi adapter which uses b43, so i may just have to use that..
<darkhalo>	every time i try and install a specific aur package, the pgp signature cannot be verified. i usually suck at compiling from source so is there a way to fix this? the package in particular is the source code for the package and i want the verification to work.
<earnestly>	you should be avoiding broadcom ;p
<namarrgon>	!give darkhalo wiki makepkg
<phrik>	darkhalo: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/makepkg
<sarcasmrules>	earnestly: it was cheap! :
<namarrgon>	darkhalo: look at the "signature checking" section
<hexhaxtron>	sarcasmrules, i'm trying to disable touchpad when typing but i'm getting this: $ syndaemon -t -k -i 2
<hexhaxtron>	no synaptics properties on device 'synps/2 synaptics touchpad'.
<earnestly>	sarcasmrules: so are the others tbh
<sarcasmrules>	hexhaxtron: does palmdetect work for you?
<earnestly>	sarcasmrules: there's not inherently cheap about them, it's just that broadcom hates linux and open source
<hexhaxtron>	sarcasmrules, $ synclient palmdetect=1
<hexhaxtron>	couldn't find synaptics properties. no synaptics driver loaded?
<shardish>	brandiee: i'm late to the discussion. my 2c is that the support for arch is better than almost any other distribution - its just diy support as opposed to relying on others.
<sarcasmrules>	earnestly: i bought an unbranded adapter, so i didn't actually know at the time.. ah well.
<earnestly>	sarcasmrules: that's what usually catches people out :/
<brandiee>	shardish, k
<sarcasmrules>	hexhaxtron: what's your xorg config for the touchpad?
<hexhaxtron>	sarcasmrules, i don't have one...
<brandiee>	shardish, i just realised that sounded really dismissive.. sorry, thanks for your 2c :)
<sarcasmrules>	hexhaxtron: don't have xorg, or don't have a config?
<earnestly>	or the ddx, really
<hexhaxtron>	sarcasmrules, i got a xorg.conf but nothing related to the touchpad.
<hyo0301>	hlep!! i'm stuck http://puu.sh/hcipu/4b471dd0f4.png

<sarcasmrules>	hexhaxtron: ah, ok. i'd add a file into xorg.conf.d as shown here, it may help: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/touchpad_synaptics#frequently_used_options
<phrik>	title: touchpad synaptics - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<shardish>	brandiee: haha, its ok i didn't read it as such. you'll find out if you gel with arch quite quickly i think. personally i absolutely love it on the rare occasion arch breaks, it forces you to learn something usually. i feel like i've learnt more in the short time i've been using arch than the years using other distros.
<sarcasmrules>	and i'm guessing you have the synaptics driver installed right?
<aldum>	hi, quick question
<sarcasmrules>	 aldum go for it!
<aldum>	is there an ntfsresize on the installer?
<earnestly>	aldum: is this ntfs disk containing a windows install?
<aldum>	yes
<earnestly>	don't use ntfresize then
<earnestly>	use windows' tools
<aldum>	you think? i did it before successfully
<earnestly>	yes, it even tells you not to
<belak>	what are possible reasons for my local host name not resolving? my computer's host is gleep, but dig gleep doesn't return any results
<aldum>	i know, that wasn't the question :)
<belak>	host gleep says host gleep not found: 3(nxdomain)
<arch-tk>	earnestly: is it because of magic proprietary pixie dust which windows's ntfsresize uses to fix a resized partition for booting?
<belak>	i have gleep in /etc/hosts
<earnestly>	arch-tk: it's because windows knows what it's doing better than ntfsresize
<earnestly>	arch-tk: it's a crapshoot if it works or not
<aldum>	it's their fs after all
<earnestly>	no
<earnestly>	sometimes windows won't let you resize while ntfsresize will.  it knows more about the state of the system than the latter.  but go ahead anyway, it's your data
<hyo0301>	http://puu.sh/hcjqr/eab4cd2340.png
<aldum>	i tend to not give a damn about windows and it's idiosyncracies :d
<earnestly>	its*
<aldum>	right, sorry
<sarcasmrules>	hyo0301: what's the output of 'journalctl -xe | grep lightdm'?
<hexhaxtron>	sarcasmrules, yes, syndaemon works now. however, i still can't figure out how to select portions of text or lines of text.
<hexhaxtron>	got it! thanks!
<sarcasmrules>	hexhaxtron: brilliant! glad to hear!
<sarcasmrules>	hexhaxtron: also, if you want natural scrolling and it's not working yet, follow this guide here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/touchpad_synaptics#natural_scrolling
<phrik>	title: touchpad synaptics - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<hexhaxtron>	oh... my right click (two taps at the same time) stopped working...
<sarcasmrules>	hexhaxtron: what window manager are you using? does three taps work?
<hexhaxtron>	sarcasmrules, yes, 3 taps selects the whole line.

<sarcasmrules>	hexhaxtron: seems odd that is happening. maybe it's something to do with your xfce settings?
<hexhaxtron>	sarcasmrules, i think it's related to xorg.conf
<hexhaxtron>	some missing configuration.
<sarcasmrules>	hmm, that's what the tapbutton[123] is meant to control. i guess there's no harm in setting tapbutton2 =3 and vice versa to see if that works/

<leming>	no, as that applies to the software being packaged, not the file named pkgbuild and its associated files to build said package

<sarcasmrules>	leming: oh, right.

<dacoit>	n for nosave
<reisio>	different car, though
<hongouru>	dacoit, is that for me ?
<reisio>	still hilarious/scary
<hiptobecubic>	good lord
<dacoit>	hongouru: me and braindamage, yeah.
<sudokode>	reisio: similar mass
<hiptobecubic>	that poor car
<reisio>	it looks like a more expensive car, actually
<hiptobecubic>	looks like a daewoo
<reisio>	but same car would've been nicer
<hiptobecubic>	judging by the grill
<sudokode>	lmao
<hongouru>	dacoit, ok, maybe that is too much... dacoit i am having problems with nameserver at 127.0.0.1
<sudokode>	in any case, similar mass and crumple zones gives you essentially the same crash
<reisio>	yeah the front seats are gone
<sudokode>	really, it doesn't matter much at that speed
<hongouru>	dacoit, if i let the nameserver be the isp one it works, but i was using my own
<reisio>	back passengers, if they were strapped down like race car drivers, would've been fine
<coolthingy500>	huh.
<reisio>	not their brains, but
<reisio>	the rest of them
<hongouru>	dacoit, now it doesn't work anymore.

<sudokode>	!math convert 100 mph kph
<phrik>	sudokode: 160.93
<earnestly>	well, 1 mile = ~ 1.6 km, so that's easy
<sudokode>	earnestly: 1.6093
<sudokode>	noob
<coolthingy500>	rip car. won't want to be ya.
<braindamage>	over land or water? :j
<dacoit>	hongouru: does the unbound service run properly? `systemctl status` is it listening on desired port (53 probably) ? `netstat -lunt`

<earnestly>	!math convert 1 mph kph
<phrik>	earnestly: 1.61
<earnestly>	hm
<sudokode>	rounding!
<earnestly>	sudokode: anyway, roughly ~
<reisio>	still safer than jet travel, though
<earnestly>	not not ;p
<reisio>	because: brakes

<earnestly>	but interesting results from python
<coolthingy500>	apply the hand break you dumb bitch.
<earnestly>	yay floating point
<dacoit>	hongouru: and thirdly, does a test resolve work? for example dig @127.0.0.1 google.com
<sudokode>	heh
<hongouru>	drill ?
<hongouru>	dacoit, it just shows 1 query and 0 answer
<sudokode>	earnestly: convert probably always defaults to 2 decimal places
<sudokode>	or there's a setting in supybot
<sudokode>	just for sanity of eyeballs
<earnestly>	sudokode: it might do correct rounding
<reisio>	not just for boobs, apparently: https://www.tumblr.com/search/don%20hertzfeldt%20gif
<phrik>	title: don hertzfeldt gif | tumblr (at www.tumblr.com)
<dacoit>	hongouru: what about the systemctl status and netstat
<sudokode>	earnestly: "correct" rounding?
<hongouru>	dacoit, netstat i dont have it, systemctlo status unbound.service is running
<dacoit>	hongouru: dammit, net-tools. `ss` then
<sudokode>	earnestly: if you mean significant figures, 1 mph would equal 1 kph :p
<sudokode>	well, 2
<earnestly>	sudokode: :p
<sudokode>	1.0 mph == 1.6 kph
<sudokode>	1.00 mph == 1.61 kph
<earnestly>	is it exactly 1.6?
<hongouru>	dacoit, ss -lt no 53  open
<sudokode>	and thusely
<earnestly>	1.60934 apparently
<sudokode>	earnestly: no but you go by your measured value
<sudokode>	mph->kph conversion is a defined ratio
<earnestly>	sudokode: anyway, i assume the convert module just does proper rounding up
<sudokode>	so it doesn't count towards your sigfigs
<sudokode>	earnestly: there is no such thing
<earnestly>	there is, if programmed
<sudokode>	you have to pick somewhere to round
<smrtz|nix>	i'm trying to get audio to work, but speaker-test -c 2 returns a playback open error: -2,no such file or directory.  any ideas?
<sudokode>	and that's not correct if you're converting scientific values
<hongouru>	dacoit, i gotta leave sorry, thank you ill try later if you are around... cya !
<earnestly>	!math convert 1.0009 mph kph
<phrik>	earnestly: 1.61079
<earnestly>	that's even more confusing now
<dacoit>	hongouru: alright
<sudokode>	!math convert 1 mph kph
<phrik>	sudokode: 1.61
<hongouru>	dacoit, bye
<sudokode>	earnestly: it's trying to do sigfigs but failing
<sudokode>	it's supplying a defined ratio which shouldn't count towards the sigfigs. plus it's not even getting it right. it's just rounding at 2
<earnestly>	sudokode: something like that, but my hypothesis was that it'd return, rounded up, the number of significant figures you used
<sudokode>	now the other way works, if you tweak the measured value
<smrtz|nix>	any tips on troubleshooting alsa?  i'm not getting any playback at all.
<sudokode>	!math convert 1.000 mph kph

<sudokode>	nope that's wrong too
<belak>	is the source for phrik anywhere public?
<earnestly>	!math convert 1.00000 mph kph
<phrik>	earnestly: 1.61
<sudokode>	ughhh
<sudokode>	lol
<sudokode>	wtf phrik
<earnestly>	fun.
<sudokode>	you're so fucking off
<smrtz|nix>	reisio: yeah, i've gone throught the alsa wiki page, but i'm still not able to get it to work...
<sarcasmrules>	alrighty, i'm going to head off to bed now. see y'all!
<sudokode>	it's driving me insane
<earnestly>	i guess the sauce would help

<earnestly>	sudokode: gnu requires all tools provide a --version and --help
<earnestly>	sudokode: so much code needed for that
<dan39>	i like the program "yes". once in a while i will be helping someone with cli and they keep typing stuff and hitting enter, always funny when they start a sentence with "yes" :d

<phrik>	title: math - how to round a number to significant figures in python - stack overflow (at stackoverflow.com)

<smrtz|nix>	any ideas now?
<arch-tk>	earnestly: the code is actually a really interesting way to compensate for division by multiple orders of magnitude

<earnestly>	but okay
<sudokode>	lol
<earnestly>	"let's add one signifiant digit.", i was right, yay
<earnestly>	observation wins again
<sudokode>	earnestly: well, it's really hard to do this stuff without treating the numbers like strings
<earnestly>	sudokode: that's why functions exist to convert fairly arbitrary strings into numbers.  don't ask what php does here.
<sudokode>	lol
<sudokode>	i've seen
<sudokode>	php is a nightmare
<smrtz|nix>	reisio: i just followed the audio section on the x120e wiki page, and now speaker-test is running, but i'm not getting any output.
<bougyman>	every language is a nightmare
<arch-tk>	it counts the amount of digits after the decimal place in the input digit, adds that to the number of zeros in the digits after the decimal place for the result, and then adds one
<bougyman>	!ыгслы
<reisio>	smrtz|nix: everything's unmuted in alsamixer?
<bougyman>	!sucks
<phrik>	not as much as bougyman's mother.
<mrelendig>	smrtz|nix: use mplayer or similar to test with instead
<sudokode>	actually, if you're working with perl, you might notice that you can $foo == $bar if they're initialized with anything other than a number
<mrelendig>	and check the mixer
<sudokode>	that may have changed since
<smrtz|nix>	reisio: yep.
<arch-tk>	so a conversion of n.0000 to 0.000... would give you 4 + 3 + 1 digits
<smrtz|nix>	mrelendig: ok, i'll install that now.
<arch-tk>	now where are my 8 digits?
<sudokode>	but you used to have to use the eq operator for string comparison
<reisio>	smrtz|nix: and what card does alsamixer say at the top?
<smrtz|nix>	mrelendig: i can send you a sceen shot of alsamixer if you'd like.
<smrtz|nix>	reisio: hda ati sb
<sudokode>	which is so weird since in any case, perl treats all scalars the same
<sudokode>	any other*
<reisio>	hda ati?
<arch-tk>	earnestly: oh
<reisio>	i wonder if you're in some kind of magical hybrid graphics/_audio_ fantasyland nightmare :d
<arch-tk>	earnestly: str(number)
<arch-tk>	earnestly: alright, yeah

<smrtz|nix>	reisio: i wouldn't be supprised.  this laptop has been giving me hell in arch forever...
<sudokode>	[17:59] tim ~ $ perl -e 'if ("1" == "1") { print "equal\n" }'
<sudokode>	equal
<sudokode>	it has changed
<smrtz|nix>	mrelendig: getting a lot of 404's when trying to install mplayer.  can you recommend something else to test with?
<sudokode>	earnestly: in any case, if you wanna express sigfigs properly, scientific notation
<earnestly>	sudokode: hooray
<mrelendig>	smrtz|nix: user error
<mrelendig>	smrtz|nix: -syu mplayer
<sudokode>	ikr
<sudokode>	makes everything easier
<mrelendig>	always use -syu when installing stuff
<mrelendig>	and ofcourse make sure your mirror isn't complete shit
<mrelendig>	are you really using arch and not one of the forks?
<arch-tk>	breaking bad, the television show where everyone has a voicemail
<smrtz|nix>	mrelendig: but, what if i don't want to do a system wide update that might break everything?
<mrelendig>	smrtz|nix: then don't use gnu/linux
<mrelendig>	and specially not arch
<mrelendig>	!sos
<phrik>	_never_ -sy when installing! http://gist.io/5660494
<mrelendig>	!partial
<phrik>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman#partial_upgrades_are_unsupported
<mrelendig>	read those two
<smrtz|nix>	mrelendig: heh, fair enough.
<mrelendig>	doing partial updates on any rolling release binary based distro will break your system
<sudokode>	earnestly: measured --> (1.00 * 10^2) * (1.6093 * 10^1) <-- defined = 1.6093 * 10^2 <-- use lowest measured sigfigs --> 1.61 * 10^2 kph
<earnestly>	it is possible to implement partial updates on rolling release with versioned dependencies, although it will happen that some partial updates will actually update a lot anyway
<mrelendig>	you would have to support multiple versions of the same package
<earnestly>	yep
<earnestly>	and keep all the versions in the mirrors too
<arch-tk>	i theorised how you could implement that and it wouldn't actually be all that difficult with a bit of recursion and knowledge of pacman's codebase.
<earnestly>	void does it
<smrtz|nix>	mrelendig: that first link was pretty well written.
<sudokode>	void?
<earnestly>	i don't think it's worth it, but then i'm idealistic
<earnestly>	"everyone should always be using the latest stable releases for everything"
<earnestly>	"people should always make sure that they don't break api on minor version bumps"
<arch-tk>	all you need to do is to ensure that for every package which gets updated as a result of a package being updated, any packages which depend on that version of the package get updated to.
<earnestly>	good luck doing both of those things
<arch-tk>	with, of course, the prevention of recursing back onto itself, but that's not entirely difficult.
<earnestly>	arch-tk: yeah, pacman can do it, it's distro policy which doesn't (here)
<codebam>	does anyone know of a cpu simulator pacakge?
<arch-tk>	to be honest, it wouldn't be hard to retrofit pacman with the support for this with an over elaborate bash script.

<earnestly>	sudokode: i know that one

<earnestly>	amstan: they don't have a license
<sudokode>	earnestly: ofc you do
<earnestly>	well, implicitly yes
<earnestly>	but
<earnestly>	no explicit license
<sudokode>	what's the implicit license?
<amstan>	earnestly: i'm having problems getting patches aproved by my employer because of that
<amstan>	sudokode: just general copyright i assume
<earnestly>	sudokode: whatever the country's stance on it is
<sudokode>	afaict, if you don't specify a license, it just falls under copyright
<earnestly>	yeah
<sudokode>	which is murky in every country
<earnestly>	depends on the laws of the country, but yeah
<amstan>	sudokode: so if you copy a pkgbuild and modify it so it's -git, you're breaching copyright on the original package
<sudokode>	some might require express consent for reproduction
<earnestly>	amstan: effectively.  i suggest, since you're actually providing a credible reason, to make a bug report asking for a license
<earnestly>	amstan: and explain the situation
<amstan>	earnestly: this is for archlinuxarm actually, but archlinux has the same problem it seems
<sudokode>	amstan: technically yes
<lyonsb>	(you'd prob. have to modify it more than 10% to do that though, and soo . . . in america, you could claim the modified vers. as your own)
<sudokode>	but
<sudokode>	that depends on where you got the pkgbuild
<earnestly>	let's see if the repos have a license
<amstan>	not to mention aur....
<sudokode>	if it's been uploaded to the aur, you likely give some consent in the tos
<earnestly>	yeah, there is no license set for any of the official pkgbuilds
<earnestly>	fucking licenses, i hate them so much
<sudokode>	lyonsb: modification has nothing to do with copyright actually. just simply by copying something, you're reproducing it
<lebenserfahrung>	what's up fellas?
<amstan>	earnestly: all i'm trying to do is offer my kernel so other people can have fun with the hardware...
<sudokode>	and that's where it gets murky because digital content like text and code falls under literary copyright
<amstan>	earnestly: and i got stuck in all of this :(
<sudokode>	at least in the us
<earnestly>	amstan: not your fault, your employers
<sudokode>	and like every country where copyright laws suck
<earnestly>	amstan: i don't usually give a shit about licenses, but what can you do
<sudokode>	amstan: where did you get this pkgbuild?
<amstan>	sudokode: what?
<earnestly>	the only license which has a spirit is the gpl2, i don't care about the license itself, just what it's trying to do
<earnestly>	that and all the mit/isc/bsd2 ones, same thing
<sudokode>	amstan: the one you'd like to modify
<sudokode>	i assume that's why you're asking
<earnestly>	probably from the alarm repos
<amstan>	sudokode: i heavily modified https://github.com/archlinuxarm/pkgbuilds/tree/master/core/linux-chromebook2 and made a new package
<phrik>	title: pkgbuilds/core/linux-chromebook2 at master · archlinuxarm/pkgbuilds · github (at github.com)
<sudokode>	amstan: this repository hosts pkgbuilds that have been modified from the upstream arch linux release in order to build on architectures supported by arch linux arm. unmodified upstream packages do not belong here.
<sudokode>	so this repo is already copying copyrighted material
<earnestly>	sudokode: some times
<sudokode>	well, lets say in the us
<earnestly>	also lacks a license
<sudokode>	since that's really all that matters
<sudokode>	yes, it's unlicensed, which is why it only falls under copyright
<earnestly>	amstan: anyway, make a bug report to both
<sudokode>	if there are no terms, you can't copy it
<earnestly>	amstan: you're not the first person to have had a problem, but the others had no credible reason for needing it either
<amstan>	sudokode: so according to that, a lot of packages violate copyright
<sudokode>	or better yet, find out what arch's policy is on using their stuff
<sudokode>	amstan: oh yeah. mine definitely do
<sudokode>	see if i give a fuck
<earnestly>	most of mine are original :d
<amstan>	sudokode: i wouldn't either :)
<sudokode>	you probably shouldn't either btw :p
<sudokode>	but anyway, i don't think arch is going to go after alarm or you or in any combination because you copied their pkgbuild as long as you leave the copyrights in place
<earnestly>	assuming copyright doesn't also prevent clean room duplication or whatever it's called
<sudokode>	earnestly: it doesn't. and shouldn't
<smrtz|nix>	mrelendig: any more ideas?
<sudokode>	but you have to be able to defend it :p
<lyonsb>	white-room reverse engineering?  (as opposed to green room reverse engineering?) -- ireally don't know, just heard of things like that.
<sudokode>	which again, i doubt this would ever come to
<earnestly>	sudokode: the problem isn't "oh, they won't go after you".  his employer, being an arm dev, is scared of it.
<mrelendig>	techically noone is allowed to use anything from aur
<sudokode>	for good reason
<mrelendig>	due to lack of licensing
<earnestly>	sudokode: i've heard a lot keep things closed just because hides their code from trolls
<sudokode>	heh
<earnestly>	the aur should just require everything be made gpl2 and be done with it
<amstan>	leming: relevant discussions btw ^
<earnestly>	or isc/mit
<amstan>	earnestly: that would make it a lot simpler, yes
<earnestly>	(personally i don't care, i'll do whatever i want regardless)
<sudokode>	earnestly: why not gplv3?
<earnestly>	sudokode: mostly linus' sentiments
<sudokode>	i don't know the details there
<sudokode>	all i've heard him say is "gplv2 works for me"
<earnestly>	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pakiz7gjlru
<sudokode>	paraphrasing... probably revolution os
<earnestly>	phrik: ping
<phrik>	earnestly: ping [--c <count>] [--i <interval>] [--t <ttl>] [--w <timeout>] <host or ip>
<earnestly>	oh well
<sudokode>	who broke phrik ;_;
<sudokode>	!pong
<phrik>	fuck off, i'm busy.
<sudokode>	whatever works
<namarrgon>	!ping6
<phrik>	namarrgon: ping6 [--c <count>] [--i <interval>] [--t <ttl>] [--w <timeout>] <host or ip>
<namarrgon>	oh my! so advanced!
<sudokode>	!ping5
<sudokode>	phrik: ping5 is <reply> "ping5 [--c <count>] [--i <interval>] [--t <ttl>] [--w <timeout>] <host or ip>"
<phrik>	sudokode: tada!
<sudokode>	mwahaha
<sudokode>	the missing version you've all been looking for
<namarrgon>	the cyber archeologists of the future will hate you
<sudokode>	that would be hilarious
<sudokode>	"professor, we've found strong evidence for ipv4 and ipv6, but thus far, we've only found one string mentioning ipv5. what does it mean?"
<keenerd>	sudokode: ipv5 was a thing, you know.
<sudokode>	meanwhile, in a church down the street... "all hail the mighty 5"
<sudokode>	keenerd: i know. go with the joke
<keenerd>	i am.  if a log of #archlinux is the only surviving record of this century i want it to be slightly factual.
<sudokode>	but that'll make the future boring
<braindamage>	i have a stupid idea, would this work? i'd like to carry a minimal environment with me when i ssh to a server, and i was thinking to use ssh's controlmaster to multiplex an rsync compressed transfer to a tmp dir of few config files and then auto source it on the remote side, this way i won't tamper permanently the config either
<t-ask>	btw. is it somehow possible to get all data of the aur database exported for olap analysis somehow?
<sudokode>	braindamage: scp -r ~/.skel/ssh/* foo@bar.com:~/ ; ssh foo@bar.com
<sudokode>	ssh foo@bar.com 'git clone https://github.com/you/ssh-config/ssh-config.git' ; ssh foo@bar.com
<sudokode>	and just let github host your configs
<sudokode>	there are all kinds of ways to do it
<braindamage>	both of those don't do what i mentioned, reuse the existing socket
<braindamage>	( altough i guess scp could be instructed to )
<sudokode>	ways

<hyo0301>	guys
<hyo0301>	how to run xfce lmao
<hyo0301>	echo "exec xfce-sessasion" ~/.xinitrc?
<godginrai>	no
<godginrai>	add `exec startxfce4` to your ~/.xinitrc, as is mentioned on the arch wiki
<hyo0301>	problem is i don't have a xinitrc
<godginrai>	create one
<hyo0301>	and there is no xinitrc in the /skel/
<hyo0301>	the templete
<godginrai>	that line is all you need
<hyo0301>	oh
<hyo0301>	ayyyy
<dacoit>	/etc/skel is gone
<hyo0301>	so no more templates?
<dacoit>	/etc/x11/xinit/xinitrc
<hyo0301>	wiki lied to me
<dacoit>	lot of templates /usr/share and such
<godginrai>	you don't really need any templates anyways
<dacoit>	/usr/share/doc
<dacoit>	right
<earnestly>	skeletons aren't templates anyway
<hyo0301>	ugh nothing happens
<spacecadet2000>	/etc/skel is part of the bash package
<hyo0301>	exec startxfce4 in .xinitrc
<spacecadet2000>	so if you reinstall bash, they should reappear
<body>	hello, i accidently chown -r username /usr/, and now my sudo isn't working anymore, and i get this error, cand somebody help me out please ?https://bpaste.net/raw/c7480718dfd6
<earnestly>	lol
<godginrai>	hyo0301: and you're just running `startx` to start x?
<dacoit>	rofl
<sudokode>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqf1dr5dnge
<sudokode>	omg
<sudokode>	i have to go here
<hyo0301>	and how do you set so that lightdm starts with startx intead of awesome and bspwm?!
<saivert>	oh it is that guy
<sudokode>	yes
<dacoit>	!grep body
<hyo0301>	godginrai:  what?
<dacoit>	grep.. jesus.
<pid1>	!give hyo0301 wiki display manager
<phrik>	hyo0301: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/display_manager
<sudokode>	!grep dacoit
<dacoit>	im losing my mind
<godginrai>	hyo0301: startx is something you use *instead* of a display manager.  you don't use the .xinitrc if you are using a dm
<sudokode>	no you're not
<sudokode>	trust me, i'm not inside your head
<body>	anybody have some ideeas ?
<dacoit>	ha..
<jasabella>	ummmm
<jasabella>	why would a package not be in a mirror repository?
<godginrai>	jasabella: because the mirror hasn't been updated
<body>	hello, i accidently chown -r username /usr/, and now my sudo isn't working anymore, and i get this error, cand somebody help me out please ?https://bpaste.net/raw/c7480718dfd6
<mrelendig>	404?
<godginrai>	body: repeating the exact same message will not get us to help you any faster
<jasabella>	godginrai... i figured but that's pretty weird, it's not an obscure one :d
<godginrai>	jasabella: the mirror is not obscure? or the package?
<dacoit>	body: chown root -r. and then go in and fix issues you see from "pacman -qk" if any.
<jasabella>	the package
<jasabella>	networkmanager to be precise
<dacoit>	/usr/local/ might have non root stuff
<godginrai>	jasabella: well, i find that it's normally the mirror's fault rather than the package.  use a more popular mirror, and you have less problems
<rat409>	body: try gksu or kdesu or whatever to get root in xterm then chown -r root:root  /usr.
<earnestly>	rat409: not everything in /usr is root:root
<jasabella>	all 5 of my uk mirrors dont have it lol
<jasabella>	but yea hok
<godginrai>	earnestly: it will be soon xd
<earnestly>	rat409: the solution is basically reinstall all the packages because lol chmod -r
<earnestly>	you could probably script reapplying just the mtrees
<dacoit>	is body short for jesse "the body" ventura
<namarrgon>	jasabella: mrelendig hinted at it, if you get 404s it's time to -syu
<jasabella>	oh
<jasabella>	-syu is like update for apt-get eh?
<jasabella>	i'm new to archlinux :d
<hyo0301>	oohh godginrai
<jasabella>	my first -syu heh
<hyo0301>	jeeez
<earnestly>	!give jasabella wiki pacman rosetta
<phrik>	jasabella: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman_rosetta
<hyo0301>	so what's the desktop entry info for xfce?
<godginrai>	jasabella: well, when you -syu, it grabs the most recent version of the package list
<godginrai>	jasabella: and updates
<dacoit>	earnestly: he only chown'd. is chown -r root plus some housekeeping not enough?
<rat409>	earnestly: yeah,its a pain :p. you tend to remember these types of probs
<jasabella>	omg i just installed dhcpd this morning and i'm alrady out of date lol
<mrelendig>	!give jasabella sos
<godginrai>	lol
<phrik>	jasabella: _never_ -sy when installing! http://gist.io/5660494
<earnestly>	dacoit: what part of 'not all files are root:root in /usr' did you not understand? if you call that "some housekeeping" then, sure.  "some"
<godginrai>	!give jasabella partial
<phrik>	jasabella: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman#partial_upgrades_are_unsupported
<jasabella>	yeah i know
<godginrai>	jasabella: just for future reference.
<dacoit>	oh i missed the entire thing then
<jasabella>	i'm trying to install a window manager, currently no gui lol
<earnestly>	i seriously have no idea how people manage to chown -r crap like this
<mrelendig>	why would you be using chown in /usr to begin with...
<earnestly>	exactly
<rat409>	indeed
<jasabella>	woo
<jasabella>	it's installing plasma

<body>	rat409: it worked by : chown root:root /usr/bin/sudo && chmod 4755 /usr/bin/sudo , thanks for the ideea tho :d cheers
<demize>	earnestly: any ideas why all of a sudden after rebooting ofter rsyncing my / to a new disk anytime i hit tab or ctrl-something on a tty it just prints a pound character?
<dacoit>	!facepalm

<earnestly>	demize: term?

<hyo0301>	'---------'
<earnestly>	that's strange
<demize>	very, and i have no idea what it might be
<earnestly>	demize: heh, does 'reset' help?
<demize>	sadly no ;)
<demize>	i guess i should try booting into the old hdd and see if the problem persists there too.
<demize>	though i should sleep now, already 01:30
<body>	i'm having trouble tu update packages with npm, anybody may know what's the problem that i get this errors ?https://bpaste.net/raw/4824a0d2bda3
<holomorph>	sleeeeeep, sleeeep *pets demize*
<earnestly>	demize: but wait, ctrl works normally?  it just sends '£' for some reason?
<demize>	nope, it doesn't work
<earnestly>	demize: keymap maybe?
<namarrgon>	body: npm err! code eacces
<demize>	keymap is us, and i've tried loading dvorak too
<earnestly>	looks like launchpad has beta support for git now
<namarrgon>	body: stat /usr/bin/yo
<namarrgon>	!wtf is yo

<demize>	heh..
<demize>	but yeoh, sleep. if i don't go now i won't for a few hours probably.
<hyo0301>	oh god how do you make lightdm work?!?!
<earnestly>	only thing i can think of is still terminfo related or something mysteries with stty/setterm
<demize>	will have to ask grawity if he has any ideas tomorrow.
<earnestly>	mysterious*
<demize>	earnestly: mmm...
<namarrgon>	hyo0301: did you get xfce to start via startx?
<hyo0301>	no
<earnestly>	demize: something to do with the layers of modifiers
<namarrgon>	hyo0301: then forget about lightdm
<hyo0301>	??
<earnestly>	demize: you know how holding down a modifer exposes another layer or keys, blah
<earnestly>	modifier*
<demize>	yeah
<hyo0301>	i didnt even need startx according to theses guys
<earnestly>	demize: try keymap gb anyway
<namarrgon>	hyo0301: you have to make sure that x works, that's why i've been telling you to set up ~/.xinitrc and startx
<earnestly>	demize: it's unlikely to be corruption moreso if that doesn't work
<namarrgon>	hyo0301: if x doesn't work you won't be able to start lightdm
<earnestly>	loadkeys uk # sorry
<demize>	earnestly: yeah, same
<hyo0301>	startx works without configs, and i can make lightdm start
<body>	namarrgon: so what can i do ? :|
<earnestly>	demize: yeah, then nothing.  i've never seen that before
<demize>	this is extremely annoying.
<hyo0301>	the problem is, i only have "awesome, and bspwm" to choose between in lightdm
<demize>	earnestly: thanks for trying at least ❤
<hyo0301>	can't choose gnome or xfce
<namarrgon>	body: isn't it obvious from the error-message?
<earnestly>	demize: are you sure you didn't try to map caps to ctrl or something, or some keyboard modifer like numlock isn't doing something weird?
<demize>	`pacman -qkkq` doesn't list anything interesting ethier..
<namarrgon>	hyo0301: so lightdm works after all?
<demize>	earnestly: not in a tty at least
<hyo0301>	no since it only shows wm not de's
<demize>	in x i have caps mapped to escape, but that's only in x.
<namarrgon>	hyo0301: have you installed xfce?
<hyo0301>	yes, and gnome
<body>	namarrgon: i don't get it really, i tryied to chown /usr/bin/yo and npm but same error return

<earnestly>	demize: oh... does this break in bash/sh?
<body>	namarrgon: nope
<dacoit>	"warning: if your path is /usr, switch to option 2:"
<demize>	earnestly: it's on the login prompt too.
<namarrgon>	body: well, why?
<dacoit>	rtfm
<earnestly>	demize: that's pretty fucky
<demize>	agreed.
<namarrgon>	body: and i'm no expert but managing system-wide packages with npm sounds like a poor idea
<namarrgon>	body: especially if you don't know how permissions work
<demize>	it feels like i have to have somehow fucked something up myself... but all i've done is rsynced everything over..
<earnestly>	demize: that'll at least be interesting to know if you ever figure that out
<demize>	and since pacman didn't complain.. hmm..
<demize>	earnestly: i'll report back if i do.
<body>	namarrgon: so it's better to use it with sudo ?
<earnestly>	but i have no idea if even bin/login is busted
<earnestly>	i mean, that' like hardware level problems
<earnestly>	i assume xorg works?
<dacoit>	namarrgon: ._.
<demize>	it does, yeah
<earnestly>	demize: same machine, just different hdd?
<teraflop>	ill sue difm it's a shame the better mixes are always when im going to sleep
<demize>	yep
<namarrgon>	body:  you have no choice if you want to manage system-wide packages
<earnestly>	demize: right, welp the only other thing i can think of is "the kernel", which is useless to say because it could mean anything.  out of ideas
<namarrgon>	dacoit: hm?
<dacoit>	namarrgon: wrong person

<earnestly>	demize: on a uk layout (no need to sudo), what does shift-3 do?

<r00trunner>	hey guys! i'm looking for an easy to use image manipulation program (gimp is way to bloaty). i want to edit some photos like cutting, change color, etc. any suggestions?
<namarrgon>	body: linux-lts is 3.14.40. 3.17 was dropped by upstream a long time ago and hasn't seen a single (security) fix since
<namarrgon>	body: have you reported your wifi issue?

<dacoit>	theres a ton. i like pinta
<body>	namarrgon: didn't reported the issue
<body>	namarrgon: i would like to , but i'm not sure how can i do it, with all the details so they can fix the problem
<body>	namarrgon: i tought about, but i wasn't sure how to do it
<namarrgon>	body: kerne.org has a link to the bugtracker
<namarrgon>	kernel.org
<diegoviola>	how do you guys manage your ssh-agent? it's annoying to export ssh_auth_sock every time and ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
<r00trunner>	dacoit: i know that list. just wanted to here some personal opinions
<dacoit>	like i said, pinta. its a linux version(loosely) of paint.net
<earnestly>	darktable ;p
<dacoit>	for your everyday raw editing :p
<earnestly>	you can open other kinds of files, it's also non-destructive which can be nice
<xyzaffa1r>	when ever i launch docky i get this:http://sprunge.us/ibhx
<xyzaffa1r>	and it instantly closes.
<xyzaffa1r>	or never opens actually
<earnestly>	system.timezonenotfoundexception
<xyzaffa1r>	is that directed towards me?
<dacoit>	its from your paste
<xyzaffa1r>	ok
<xyzaffa1r>	well.
<xyzaffa1r>	what do i do?
<earnestly>	why can't it find a timezone on your system?
<xyzaffa1r>	me?
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly: are you talking to me?
<earnestly>	good grief
<earnestly>	who else?
<xyzaffa1r>	well, use the highlight thing :)
<xyzaffa1r>	i have no clue.
<earnestly>	xyzaffa1r: are you talking to me?
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly: what?
<dacoit>	heh
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly: oh.
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly: i don't know why.
<earnestly>	xyzaffa1r: /etc/localtime
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly: thanks, what do i do with that?
<earnestly>	should be a symlink to your timezone
<earnestly>	you could also set tz=europe/london or whatever
<potmo>	guys help me get netty the netbook working for me
<escondida>	!give potmo ask
<phrik>	potmo: don't ask to ask, if anyone is here or alive, or uses something. just ask, and we'll get moving along. thanks.
<sudokode>	earnestly: so yeah what do i do with that?
<sudokode>	do i like run it?
<potmo>	sorry i know
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly: should i just redo the timezone step in the begginers guide? new install, probably screwed something up.
<homerj>	i'm a zombie, check your living privilege
<sudokode>	xyzaffa1r: file /etc/localtime
<earnestly>	xyzaffa1r: you can confirm it's a symlink to the correct place
<homerj>	thank you
<thrice>	nice, llpp can't be built on debian.  ocaml too oooold
<earnestly>	yeah, llpp basically needs the latest ocaml for the bytestring stuff
<thrice>	which isn't too unreasonable, given that the release was about a year ago.  but, debian
<potmo>	i haven't used the netbook in quite some time maybe a year, i try pacman -syu and it says can't resolve dependencies ... do i need to install whole new release .iso or what?
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly: i can confirm it exists, not much else :)
<earnestly>	not only exists
<thrice>	potmo: it'd be easier, but you might be able to do it.  paste?
<homerj>	debian hasn't met a program they didn't like to be two major versions behind on
<dacoit>	<sudokode> │ xyzaffa1r: file /etc/localtime
<pid1>	xyzaffa1r, you were given a command. what's the output of "file /etc/localtime"
<reisio>	ah comparing debian stable to other distro bleeding edge
<reisio>	what a fun game that is
<dexter>	i lost the game
<dexter>	=[
<potmo>	thrice: sorry not sure what you want me to paste? should i redirect the output from pacman to a file or something?
<thrice>	i wasn't comparing it to anything
<xyzaffa1r>	/etc/localtime: broken symbolic link to /usr/share/zoneinfo/american/los_angeles
<reisio>	i hear in the 1500s they didn't have electric cars, those fools

<sudokode>	well there's your problem
<xyzaffa1r>	thanks.
<sudokode>	ah american
<earnestly>	hehe
<sudokode>	tab completion ftw
<earnestly>	my timezone is american!
<reisio>	winning ftw
<xyzaffa1r>	:)
<potmo>	thrice: what will that do exactly?
<sim590>	is this "principle" (http://ix.io/iiw) of python executables naming on all systems? do all systems (linux, freebsd, mac, windows) name the executables to something similar. `python` pointing to `python2` or `python3`, but the principle is the same, right ?
<dacoit>	/usr/share/zoneinfo/freedom/o/clock
<thrice>	potmo: you can paste your command to that net that way.  or, just pastebin the output any way you plase
<thrice>	we just need to see it, if you want help
<lebenserfahrung>	any recommended apps to download from f-android?
<reisio>	lebenserfahrung: hrmm?

<tom^>	earnestly: wat
<supergeek800>	well that was a waste of time.
<lebenserfahrung>	keenerd: yes :-)
<reisio>	supergeek800: always is
<earnestly>	tom^: nouveau perf counter stuff
<keenerd>	lebenserfahrung: rmaps mostly.
<lebenserfahrung>	keenerd: what do you use for maps; or rather key in a list of apps you have :-)
<tom^>	earnestly: ooh i see
<potmo>	thrice do i have to pipe the command into it or what? i am very confused now, what am i pasting where?
<potmo>	you guys always make me feel so dumb heh
<thrice>	your "pacman -syu" output
<keenerd>	lebenserfahrung: i try to have as few apps as possible and do as much as i can in an arch chroot.
<potmo>	maybe it's because i am
<potmo>	so pacman -syu | curl etc?
<halfwit>	that's the mentality to have.
<halfwit>	!tias
<phrik>	try it and see™
<dacoit>	said the halfwit
<lebenserfahrung>	keenerd: same here. but i don't want to miss out on the essentials
<braindamage>	osmand is quite nice
<earnestly>	keenerd: does it use openstreetmaps?
<thrice>	potmo: we can only take you so far :-)
<keenerd>	earnestly: it can use a dozen different sources.  though half of them are russian-area stuff.
<earnestly>	heh
<potmo>	ok i am hoping that that is a yes stand back it might explode
<keenerd>	lebenserfahrung: everything is mostly fine.  mp3 players have been the only rough patch.  rockbox for android and vlc are the two standouts.
<lebenserfahrung>	keenerd: installed vlc :-)
<potmo>	thrice: by the way  i did not mention that it asked me to replace certain things and i just said yes to all of them

<rasi>	reisio: and if words are not one word, then we combine them using a dash
<n00balert>	is-this-still-a-one-word?
<rasi>	it actually can be
<reisio>	rasi: plus, capitals
<rasi>	reisio: i hate capitals
<supergeek800>	of course what would really be preferred is hardware that can handle the latest stuff no matter what os platform i go with (except bsd, as i imagine it would have trouble running on modern hardware as it's further behind than bleeding-edge or cutting-edge linux distros, the latest windows, and the latest osx combined).
<reisio>	ß!
<rasi>	reisio: capitals are so useless
<rasi>	and excessive comma rules
<reisio>	capitols, too
<reisio>	and how about belgium
<rasi>	what is belgium?
<rasi>	never heard of that
<earnestly>	rasi: your name has capitals
<rasi>	earnestly: capitals for names make sense
<n00balert>	lol

<n00balert>	earnestly: lol
<rasi>	earnestly: that's great. normally i really care about it. for some reason online i don't
<earnestly>	rasi: it's so bad that i used to habitually type "it's" regardless d:
<halfwit>	it also helps when you're writing out expanded acronyms, and don't want them to be confused.

<earnestly>	rasi: nope, i had a bot follow me around correcting usage of it until i got the hang of it

<rasi>	:)
<reisio>	hey if it gives you a woody, it must be right
<noremi>	namarrgon: not sure if you're on or not, but i ended up simple reinstalling arch. i am writing this from 4.0.1!
<rasi>	sounds like the wrong solution, but hey
<n00balert>	rasi: i don't get the last pic :(
<namarrgon>	noremi: why?
<rasi>	then you are no grammar nazi
<halfwit>	nazi is a proper name.
<n00balert>	haha...hm
<namarrgon>	noremi: all you had to do was to mount /boot, pacman -s linux and add /boot to fstab
<tigrmesh>	uh
<n00balert>	and maybe linux-devel too
<rasi>	linux-devel?
<rasi>	what?
<n00balert>	well...not with /boot only ..
<rasi>	you mean -headers?
<tigrmesh>	that's grammar *fascist*, thank you very much
<n00balert>	yesh
<rasi>	those only make sense if you want to build kernel modules
<noremi>	namarrgon: after updating i was unable to use a bunch of things (mouse/keyboard) and was unable to downgrade. so i decided to reinstall
<potmo>	ok hmm ca certificates?
<n00balert>	rasi: yeah i usually have to
<halfwit>	tigrmesh: it's possible that in another life, you and i were kin.
<tigrmesh>	hehe
<earnestly>	wait, does this mean you can invoke godwin on grammar nazis?
<namarrgon>	noremi: why didn't you come back into the channel and say something?
<n00balert>	half-bros?
<rasi>	i dont think tigrmesh was a bro... ever
<n00balert>	bruh
<rasi>	and for earnestly: don't*
<tigrmesh>	earnestly, fascists.  nazis died out in 1945
<supergeek800>	but neonazis didn't.
<rasi>	or even better: don’t
<noremi>	namarrgon: the device i was trying fix was the one i was writing from and i had no other device?
<namarrgon>	that's what they want you to believe
<halfwit>	why even discuss it?
<earnestly>	tigrmesh: well, not entirely.  but, i'm saying, can you invoke godwin?
<namarrgon>	noremi: not even the archo iso?
<earnestly>	!godwin
<phrik>	hitler also (did/believed/said/attempted) <xyz> (run godwin --? for examples)
<tigrmesh>	supergeek800, no one used the term "grammar neonazi"
<rasi>	btw, isn't there a `’" on us keyboard?
<earnestly>	oh, godwin is hitler, not just nazi :/
<earnestly>	rasi: nope
<halfwit>	rasi: ~
<halfwit>	`
<supergeek800>	tigrmesh: and 'gramma nazzeh' would be the exact opposite.
<halfwit>	damn.
<rasi>	halfwit: no
<braindamage>	but not you mentioned it
<halfwit>	and '
<braindamage>	which automatically satisfied the criteria
<tigrmesh>	fascist
<namarrgon>	noremi: *arch iso
<noremi>	namarrgon: that may have worked. oh well, it's too late now :/
<earnestly>	braindamage: but not you?
<braindamage>	s/not/now/
<rasi>	halfwit: which is not typographically correct
<rasi>	’ < this is
<halfwit>	rasi: i was just showing the two common to us.
<rasi>	we need a grammar fascist's keyboard
<braindamage>	earnestly: well, the laws only says that the probably approaches to 1 as time goes to inf
<rasi>	time for a kickstarter campaign
<braindamage>	by becoming a meme, it becomes sorta self fulfilling, since now people mention it in reference to the law's meta discussion
<pmartnhoj>	for a simple personal ftpd, is there any reason to go with any of proftpd vsftpd or pureftpd over the others?
<braindamage>	!ftp
<phrik>	size of data to be transferred: one kilobyte. amount of data transfered to talk about the data about to be transfered: one megabyte.
<pmartnhoj>	thanks :)
<earnestly>	ideally you wouldn't use ftp at all
<tigrmesh>	you have to remember that what came before it was putting files onto magnetic tape and someone hand carrying it
<tigrmesh>	no matter how many round trips there are, ftp is still faster than that
<braindamage>	now you're mailing usb or sd cards
<earnestly>	tigrmesh: that's all well and good, but it ignores the history of ftp and it's 2015
<braindamage>	and still get a better troughtput and lower costs

<potmo>	ok it tells me move /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/*.crt to /etc/ca-certificates/trust-source/anchors/do the same with all manually-added /etc/ssl/certs/*.pem files and rename them to *.crt
<potmo>	so i didn't actually manually add any pem files but if i just rename the *.pem files with .crt extension and move them all to /etc/ca-certificates/trust-source/anchors/ ?
<sheep>	try it and see
<earnestly>	arch-tk: lol, ftp is kind of push model
<potmo>	ls *.crt |sed 1,$g s/pem/crt ?? then mv *.crt to said directory?
<pmartnhoj>	and use sftp instead?
<potmo>	obv not duh
<potmo>	probably a good time to look at halfwits bash link
<halfwit>	yeah!
<potmo>	someone throw down a command to change all .pem files to .crt within a directory so i don't have to learn bash syntax please?
<potmo>	ofc sad part is none of this is going to work
<sheep>	potmo: how many .pems do you have?
<halfwit>	man rename
<halfwit>	such as rename .pem .crt *.pem
<potmo>	like 18 or so
<sheep>	you could just do what halfwit just suggested with the rename command
<sheep>	or move each of them manually
<potmo>	wow why have i never heard of that command before?
<potmo>	lets see what should i do? one command or twenty?
<sheep>	it's not used that frequently
<halfwit>	i used google to find it since i had a nested mess of bad extenstions, heh.
<potmo>	so all the other files which do not have either a .crt or .pem extension should be left in said dir?
<potmo>	(looking at ca-certificate update in news)
<halfwit>	looks that way
<potmo>	uh oh
<potmo>	trust: the placeholder extract-compat command has not been customized by your distribution
<potmo>	i need to upgrade first :(
<earnestly>	http://mywiki.wooledge.org/shellhallofshame heh
<phrik>	title: shellhallofshame - greg's wiki (at mywiki.wooledge.org)
<halfwit>	that rant on compiling scripts is funny as well
<potmo>	so if i tell you guys the dependency cycle it is warning about will that help any? if so, it says ncurses will be installed before its bash dependency and freetype2 will be installed before its harfbuzz dependency
<potmo>	aha!!!
<potmo>	java-common you bitch
<halfwit>	java is best.
<braindamage>	java is the malware compatibility layer of choice
<halfwit>	braindamage: it comes highly recommended for use in windows xp in abms around the world!
<lyonsb>	sweet, i can learn expand my bashing skill.
<halfwit>	in/on
<potmo>	ok it says pacman -su aren't i supposed to throw a 'y' in there?
<potmo>	guys i am genius
<thrice>	not true
<thrice>	you left arch linux to rot for a year
<potmo>	just on netty the netbook
<potmo>	ok i have been neglecting arch
<potmo>	looks like i got excited too soon anyway
<potmo>	now i am getting list of all lkinds of corrupted files
<halfwit>	that needs to be strongbad's next netbook. netty i3!
<potmo>	i am also getting signature "anatol pomozov" is unknown trust
<potmo>	mirror?
<scimmia>	potmo, update archlinux-keyring
<halfwit>	afk, good luck.
<spikemaster>	are there any gui installers for arch that *just* installers, not a sub-distro. ie i just want an easy insall so i can build a system with pacman.
<potmo>	the haveged thing?
<scimmia>	potmo, no, the package itself
<tom^>	spikemaster: no.
<potmo>	so pacman -su archlinux-keyring ?
<spikemaster>	i want arch so bad. but the last time i tried to install it.... something when wrong on the "grub" step and i could not work around it after several days.
<tom^>	so learn by your mistakes and do it right now.
<utack>	spikemaster i would guess it is all uefi now anyways and something like gummiboot is really easy to install
<scimmia>	potmo, maybe i'm coming in too late. what situation are you in?
<spikemaster>	but i'm not sure if it was a mistake on my part or a temporary bug in arch (rolling release).
<tom^>	oh im fairly sure it was on your part.
<potmo>	i let my arch rot for a year and now i can't update
<tom^>	grub rarely has any showstopping bugs in [core]
<tom^>	if it ever had.
<potmo>	right now the error is a bunch of packages are signed by  a guy named anatol who is of unknown trust
<spikemaster>	potmo: is this the case?  arch permently breaks if you lapse on frequent updates for a bit?
<scimmia>	potmo, ok, a year shouldn't be so bad. run pacman -sy archlinux-keyring, then try pacman -su
<potmo>	spikemaster: ask the experts i am noob
<spikemaster>	i'm a noob too
<potmo>	you don't want a noobs leading the noobs situation
<scimmia>	spikemaster, updates get harder and harder. in come cases, you can't reasonably do it from within the system
<tigrmesh>	spikemaster, with a rolling release distro, you need to keep it up to date
<utack>	there should be a contest in "longest time span not updated". everyone gets arch with 2010 software and then it's showtime :d
<tigrmesh>	you need to read the front page and update *at least* weekly
<scimmia>	utack, as long as you can boot from external media, sure
<spikemaster>	serious? shouldn't you just be able to update, and then be up-to-date?
<scimmia>	spikemaster, if you just let it go, then no.
<utack>	woah that sounds like things start falling apart after a month tigrmesh, it is not thaaaat bad
<spikemaster>	wow.
<potmo>	so spike there are all these different packages that rely on certain other packages
<rafa6521>	a lot of little changes build up over time
<potmo>	yeah it is my fault
<scimmia>	we had a situation last year where 6 months made things very difficult to update inside the system
<spikemaster>	ya, but shoudln't the packamage manager handle that? if you want latest, it should resolve dependencies instead of permantly break forcing a re-install. no?
<spikemaster>	or am i noob?
<potmo>	 i think scimmia solved my problem
<scimmia>	spikemaster, a distro is more complex than that
<tigrmesh>	utack, not that they fall apart.  it's just that arch takes regular maintenance.  and things can change radically
<rafa6521>	the reason distros like ubuntu can handle not being updated for months and even years at a time is that at least for their stable releases, they pick a version and stick with it and if there are drastic changes that may cause problems, they're patched or otherwise worked around
<rafa6521>	with arch you're mostly on your own
<potmo>	but if you regularly update and watch the front page you should be ok no?
<scimmia>	potmo, yep
<spikemaster>	think i may just go with the debian-based route then. i don't want to permanetly break my system just by not updated for a bit. what if i go on a trip and leave the heavy tower at home? automatic breakage?
<rafa6521>	been running a vps with arch for the last 3 months or so... no major problems yet
<scimmia>	spikemaster, are you going on year long safaris?
<potmo>	nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
<dacoit>	who is supplying all this fud
<potmo>	all these java runtime commons
<rafa6521>	except for the occasional ping timeouts that add an extra number to my nick
<utack>	i wonder which situation call cause stuff breaking. do you have an example of a situation you can't recover from scimmia ?
<tom^>	utack: the limits are at your end.
<potmo>	i did the manual intervention thingy too
<spikemaster>	maybe i store my computer in the closet for a year or 2 while i play with a fancy tablet. then come back to the tower.... permantly broken? i guess a re-install is ok, but i'd rather pacman -syu just download the newer stuff and packages instead of permanetly breaking.
<utack>	tom^ sorry waht do you mean by that?
<tom^>	utack: you can recover 4 year old installs, but being incapable of installing arch when reading the wiki. you wont last months.
<scimmia>	utack, the one i was referring to was the /lib symlink moving from the glibc package to the filesystem package, plus the /bin to /usr/bin move. trying to do both at the same time doesn't work
<rafa652>	the thing is even the base system can change drastically in that time and the newest packages will assume you have the other newest packages installed
<tom^>	utack: so the situation that you cant recover from is only limited by the ability from you.
<potmo>	ok what do i do about these java runtime common errors
<rafa652>	i do wish there was a way to automatically check for updates and show up when logging in to ssh, somewhat like ubuntu does
<scimmia>	potmo, remove java? :)
<rafa652>	...actually, does such a thing exist?
<agregory>	scimmia: the symlink transition is pretty easy to work around, the real problem updating old installs are missing package conflicts
<rafa652>	i never bothered to search/ask
<tom^>	rafa652: `checkupdates`
<spikemaster>	rafa652: sure, but if there is newer stuff, is it really that difficult to have pacman handle the dependencies? isn't that what the purpose of the packamage manater is for?
<potmo>	i think i only installed it because of some silly web page i went to
<tom^>	spikemaster: it isnt dependencys its filesystem changes, config changes.
<agregory>	spikemaster: this has nothing to do with dependencies
<potmo>	i am happy to uninstall java will that solve my probs?
<scimmia>	agregory, how would you work around that one in system?
<agregory>	scimmia: just manually move all the files into /usr/lib and /usr/bin
<scimmia>	potmo, if that's what's blocking you right now, then yes, get rid of it
<scimmia>	agregory, that won't do anything for the dependency problems
<rafa652>	tom^: neat, thanks
<potmo>	i can reinstall anyway if i need right?
<utack>	great now you scared me to leave my netbook 3 months without updates... :d
<spikemaster>	so the packamage manager only handles "user space" changes? if it's somethink like a file system change everyone breaks when they do pacman -syu?
<agregory>	scimmia: huh? the symlink transition didn't have any dependnecy problems...
<tom^>	spikemaster: no.
<dacoit>	who did? no one worth listening to said that utack
<scimmia>	agregory, it did when combined with the bin move
<utack>	dacoit the general discussion
<potmo>	scimmia remove java-runtime-common or just java or what?
<scimmia>	believe me, i spent many hours here and on the forums helping people through it
<agregory>	scimmia: no? i don't know what you're referring to
<spikemaster>	just confused. if it's expected to break if you don't update in 1 year.  but the reason becuase of thigns like file system changes, but at the same time not becuase of file system changes.
<agregory>	scimmia: and i actually updated a circa 2010 system a few months ago
<scimmia>	potmo, if you don't need it, get rid of any java packages you have
<utack>	you should have made a snapshot of that thing :d
<scimmia>	agregory, while the system was running?
<agregory>	yes
<scimmia>	hmm
<dacoit>	props
<scimmia>	i know allan changed how some of that was handled with pacman 4.1, maybe that problem is taken care of
<agregory>	the only tricky bit was convincing pacman to remove packages it didn't think it needed to
<agregory>	how what was handled?
<tom^>	spikemaster: just stop, you clearly are out of your depth and probably wont even understand.
<scimmia>	agregory, the issue was that the /bin move required you to ignore the filesystem package, but doing that would leave you with no /lib symlink, so no dynamic linker
<spikemaster>	tom, but how can it break because of file system chagnes, but not break becuase of file systme changes? contradicts the reason it breaks.
<agregory>	scimmia: you don't need to ignore the filesystem update if you manually moved the files over
<scimmia>	agregory, and pacman didn't bitch about existing files?
<spikemaster>	if explained, then i will understand, but right now i don't. :(
<agregory>	scimmia: i don't recall the exact process i used any more, it may have involved --force
<utack>	these fs updates are really something. hope they don't do more of these. that works much nicer with a non rolling distro
<wildnux>	hello, i am very new to arch linux, so bear with me please
<scimmia>	agregory, and no problems with pacman with nothing in /bin or /usr/sbin?
<agregory>	none that i recall
<wildnux>	i am getting the following whenever i try to pacman -syu
<wildnux>	:: bluez-qt and libbluedevil-frameworks are in conflict
<agregory>	and, like i said, the update ultimately worked
<scimmia>	huh, i would have expected pacman or the install scripts to have a problem
<wildnux>	i cannot remove libbluedevil-frameworks because it has its dependency tree up to plasma-meta
<wildnux>	is there any way to make this work?
<supergeek800>	unless you can dl a kernel binary directly from kernel.org and install it with no real side effects.
<agregory>	scimmia: the only really clever bit was editing the local db to get pacman to remove packages during the update
<supergeek800>	on a more positive note, it's raining like a bitch in a region that needs it.
<potmo>	scimmia i don't know how to find the java packages
<scimmia>	potmo, pacman -qs java
<scimmia>	agregory, props. i didn't say it wasn't doable, just that it was difficult
<scimmia>	and after how many people screwed up the /bin move with an up to date system, i don't even recommend people try it on an older system
<supergeek800>	scimmia: what side effects would come from installing a kernel binary obtained directly from kernel.org vs. installing an arch-patched kernel from [core], if there are any?
<utack>	kernel.org has binaries?
<supergeek800>	unless tar.xz is source in this case.
<scimmia>	supergeek800, arch does make some assumptions on how the kernel is configured, but as long as it has those options, you can run whatever kernel you want
<scimmia>	supergeek800, yeah, those are source tarballs
<supergeek800>	uhh, that idea just went down the tubes, it would take days to compile the kernel on here.
<utack>	wonder where the gsco project to produce a fully llvm compiled debian will go and how it will perform
<utack>	*gsoc
<supergeek800>	#upshitcreek
<scimmia>	supergeek800, what kind of system are you on?
<supergeek800>	scimmia: and 8-yr-old am2 sempron system.
<supergeek800>	*an
<scimmia>	supergeek800, building a kernel shouldn't be too horrible
<tom^>	scimmia: well its gonna take over an hour if he builds all the drivers :p
<supergeek800>	yeah, on 1.8ghz single-core with a bigger swap file than the installed amount of ram?
<scimmia>	an hour? eh. my pentium 2 366 took longer than that
<scimmia>	(first system i built a kernel on)
<supergeek800>	scimmia: as much as i wanna run the latest kernel, holding off until either the stable kernel or lts kernel are fixed in a release or two may be in my best interests, which is really annoying.
<edit>	exit
<supergeek800>	scimmia: 4.0.1 won't boot. at all. kernel panics at boot-up. 3.14.40 won't recognize my wireless adapter.
<scimmia>	supergeek800, was 3.19 ok?
<supergeek800>	yep, and so is 3.14.39.
<scimmia>	supergeek800, if they're no longer in your cache, grab them from the arm
<scimmia>	nothing wrong with sticking to 3.19 for a while
<supergeek800>	scimmia: or 3.14.39.
<supergeek800>	(which is in my cache, btw, along with 3.14.40 and 4.0)
<scimmia>	supergeek800, you can also go with linux-ck, which is still on 3.19, but probably more updated
<supergeek800>	that or the arm might be an option, and would beat running on lts, which i felt that my hand was forced by my hardware in that matter.
<supergeek800>	scimmia: and may beat my backup plan of installing ubuntu lts minimal and setting it up in a similar manner to arch.
<potmo>	come on baby
<scimmia>	supergeek800, have you asked upstream about the adapter problem?
<supergeek800>	dling 3.19 right now.
<supergeek800>	and i betcha anything that this heavyass rain will not be a drought reliever.
<supergeek800>	typical dryass south.
<scimmia>	we were just starting to get dry before these rains. they've really helped here. mushrooms are really popping
<halosghost>	mmmm
<halosghost>	shrooms
<halosghost>	:p
<potmo>	how many times will i type sudo !!
<dacoit>	wheres that scimmia
<scimmia>	ne iowa
<halosghost>	it's nearly morel season
<halosghost>	gewdtimes
<scimmia>	it is very much morel season
<scimmia>	came home with a bag full today
<potmo>	no silly cibin that far north is there?
<halosghost>	scimmia: nice!
<dacoit>	nw il \o
<halosghost>	scimmia: my family has a small bit of property that grows thick with them
<halosghost>	scimmia: we've gotten a few gallon bags of them on good years
<scimmia>	potmo, cibin?
<potmo>	psylicibin
<scimmia>	halosghost, last year was incredible
<dacoit>	droogs
<halosghost>	:d
<potmo>	sily cibin
<scimmia>	halosghost, one trip i ended up with 6 gallon bags packed full
<potmo>	you do know what that is yes?
<halosghost>	scimmia: good lord
<halosghost>	scimmia: that's amazing
<potmo>	you can get good money for theose can't you?
<scimmia>	halosghost, and the season lasted for weeks
<sudokode>	don't ever complain about my offtopic conversations
<scimmia>	potmo, yeah, you can
<sudokode>	jesus look at this shit
<halosghost>	potmo: they're inredibly expensive when fresh
<halosghost>	scimmia: awesome!
<potmo>	yeah we had some where i used to live in cali
<sudokode>	btw, i'll take an eighth
<nixnerd>	i'm trying to get 256 colors working with tmux + urxvt. done everything the wiki says (to the best of my knowledge) and i still can't get it to work. any ideas?
<supergeek800>	rebooting, hope to hell this works and i can have a semi-recent kernel again.
<potmo>	never took advantage but someone else we let come and pick
<potmo>	omfg
<potmo>	it's working i think
<halosghost>	nixnerd: have you set tmux to default to a 256-color terminfo?
<potmo>	i am genius!
<halosghost>	that's the most common problem
<potmo>	gogogogogogogo
<nixnerd>	halosghost: i added this: set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"
<potmo>	i am about to have that woot feeling !!
<sudokode>	hm.. i think i may have put too much salt on those soft pretzels
<potmo>	you guys know the one about the guy keeps running into the wall?
<sudokode>	i can't seem to taste anything sweet now
<halosghost>	nixnerd: and when in urxvt under tmux, what is the output of `echo $term`?
<potmo>	other guy says why are you doing that?
<dacoit>	just shake the extra salt off
<potmo>	because it feels so good when i stop
<dacoit>	use it on the driveway
<sudokode>	dacoit: that's kinda difficult...
<potmo>	nothing like it finally working after pounding head against wall
<sudokode>	ya see, i sorta ate them
<potmo>	ty scimmia you are my hero
<supergeek800>	yaaaay, i can get rid of lts now!
<potmo>	i think
<dacoit>	sudokode: jumping jacks
<potmo>	maybe i better wait here
<nixnerd>	halosghost: screen-256color
<dacoit>	shake em good
<potmo>	it is upgrading
<sudokode>	dacoit: how will that fix my tongue?
<supergeek800>	may or may not keep it for a fallback though.
<scimmia>	potmo, any time
<nixnerd>	i assume it needs to say rxvt-256color
<supergeek800>	fuck it, getting rid of lts, may put mainline up to see if there's any fixes in the 4.0 line.
<sudokode>	nixnerd: no
<sudokode>	tmux-256color
<sudokode>	er, screen-256color
<sudokode>	yes, that's confusing
<supergeek800>	unless mainline is source, then nvm, more space on /boot.
<nixnerd>	so... where am i going wrong then? that's what i've got.
<sudokode>	kill all sessions and start over
<potmo>	im hoping that since i last played with netty the netbook that the documentation on lxde got better
<potmo>	i couldn't find anything in english to tell me where to find the addon stuff i wanted
<potmo>	maybe i just use window manager and don't worry about de at all
<nixnerd>	sudokode: tried. nothing works. i wonder if 256 colors work in tmux with urxvt.
<jasonwryan>	it does
<jasonwryan>	what's $term outside tmux?
<dacoit>	nixnerd: how are you testing? one of those handy dandy scripts hopefully
<halosghost>	jasonwryan: \o/
<jasonwryan>	halosghost: o/
<potmo>	rebuilding database ...
<halosghost>	jasonwryan: pm?

<diegoviola>	how much resources does gnome shell usually requires? when compared to xfce

<potmo>	woot
<potmo>	don't you guys get excited when the shit finally works?
<nixnerd>	potmo: i do. hasn't happened in a few days for me :p
<potmo>	yeah but you are doing something real
<potmo>	i thought i was going to be removing one package after the next
<diegoviola>	thanks
<nixnerd>	potmo: what are you doing again? i think i came in too late.
<potmo>	damn i have forgotten everything
<potmo>	just upgrading
<potmo>	hadn't done so in a year
<potmo>	so there were dependency nightmares etc even though i have pretty simple system
<supergeek800>	scimmia: your suggestion worked, i'm on a reasonably recent kernel again.
<nixnerd>	potmo: holy shit. no updates/upgrades in a year?
<potmo>	wasn't using the puter
<potmo>	going on road trip can't take desktop with me
<nixnerd>	potmo: gotcha.
<supergeek800>	scimmia: although i'm considering temporarily installing mainline to see if the problems in 4.0 have been fixed and i'll be able to run the latest kernel again whenever 4.1 hits stable.
<nixnerd>	you might want to configure ssh on that bad boy.
<potmo>	if i have flash drive in puter do i have to mount it?
<nixnerd>	si senor
<supergeek800>	unless having mainline even as a secondary kernel is a bad idea.
<supergeek800>	of course that's just impatience speaking.
<potmo>	what's device name going ot look like?
<nixnerd>	another issue i have is piping conky-cli to lemonbar. anyone currently doing this successfully?
<diegoviola>	gnome users, what extensions do you use to make the experience less annoying?
<charlesatum>	well, let's see
<diegoviola>	i really hate how gnome groups all the windows, so i have to press the arrow key to actually pick my window
<diegoviola>	that's what annoyed me the most when trying gnome
<diegoviola>	especially when you have 10 terminals
<diegoviola>	slows me down
<supergeek800>	diegoviola: mate + topmenu + plank + compton.
<nixnerd>	diegoviola: if you run 10 terminals... i don't think gnome is for you.
<charlesatum>	damn chrome
<diegoviola>	nixnerd: i'm running 3 right now
<diegoviola>	nixnerd: and why? gnome doesn't like terminals now?
<nixnerd>	diegoviola: no... it's just probably not the best way to view 10 terminals.
<supergeek800>	diegoviola: why is there a quake console-like extension available then?
<dacoit>	just easier to jumble 10 terminals with a tiling/stacking/tabbed wm
<nixnerd>	gnome servs a purpose... but you sound like you might be a "power user"
<dacoit>	or just use tmux
<supergeek800>	(which speaking of which, i may see if i can't replace mate-terminal with guake)
<nixnerd>	i'll second dacoit. i'd use a tiling wm or tmux or both.
<halfwit>	potmo: and sucess?
<potmo>	i think so halfwit!!
<potmo>	about to restart
<potmo>	obv lots has been done with lxde
<charlesatum>	damn network manager
<charlesatum>	anyway, for gnome i use:
<charlesatum>	alternate tab, dash to dock, removable drive menu
<charlesatum>	battery status, caffeine
<diegoviola>	charlesatum: alternate tab makes switching between windows easier, no?
<charlesatum>	yup
<diegoviola>	i will try that
<halfwit>	around here, if you aren't using the flavor of the month, you aren't worth shit.
<tom^>	then i havent ever been worth shit
<dacoit>	dont we know it tom^
<charlesatum>	halfwit: what do you mean?
<nixnerd>	halfwit: a lot of people believe that but i don't and many others don't. i run gnome on a few machines. just not my main machine.
<halfwit>	nixnerd: eh, i'd use gnome if it best suited my particular use case
<halfwit>	nixnerd: it's nice for what it does
<nixnerd>	halfwit: right. exactly. no need to hate on gnome. that's not what i was meaning to do. it just doesn't work for my daily needs. that's all.

<potmo>	all the stuff i learned i have to relearn
<potmo>	and plane leaves tommorrow morning
<sudokode>	but anyway
<homerj>	i also remember one year we couldn't watch football on thanksgiving because she wanted to watch lassie
<sudokode>	we can all surely agree the best show ever was the golden girls
<homerj>	yes
<halfwit>	agreed.
<homerj>	i love that show
<homerj>	it's on hallmark channel i believe
<sudokode>	that's 2/2
<dacoit>	3/3
<homerj>	matter of face
<sudokode>	statistics always works
<homerj>	it's on now
<sudokode>	100% of the planet likes the golden girls
<sudokode>	with 0.1% confidence
<homerj>	of course, no one talks about the spinoff
<homerj>	where they owned a hotel
<tigrmesh>	so
<sudokode>	we don't not speak of it
<sudokode>	but there's always designing women
<halfwit>	it's like joey, just let it die.
<tigrmesh>	did they run arch linux og the hotel server?
<tigrmesh>	*on
<homerj>	i even forget what that show was called
<charlesatum_>	hmm, interesting side effect of forced power down
<homerj>	it was only on for a season
<tigrmesh>	offtopic
<homerj>	just that miles left rose at the alter and married someone else with a cow-themed wedding
<sudokode>	no, that wasn't it
<tigrmesh>	yo
<sudokode>	spoiler alert
<sudokode>	god man
<halfwit>	as delighted as i am with this conversation, i need to afk and sleep due to tiredness.
<tigrmesh>	take this discussion to another channel
<supergeek800>	just now replaced mate-terminal with guake.
<tigrmesh>	what do you think of it?
<supergeek800>	nice!
<sudokode>	more enthusiam
<supergeek800>	it's easter to press the tilde key to pull up a terminal than to go into a menu or down to a dock icon or whatever and open the default terminal, and it looks cooler.
<tigrmesh>	nice
<dacoit>	there are some default keybindings for that im sure
<halfwit>	demonstrably amiable
<dacoit>	ctrl+t maybe
<dacoit>	i dont recall
<homerj>	my calculator button opens a terminal
<jushur>	i have super+tilde to open terminals here, no matter what i use on my box.
<homerj>	i have four buttons on top of my keypad
<homerj>	also have a thing that will remap them to pf1-pf4 on a terminal
<halfwit>	that's a four-key chord for me on here, too much.
<supergeek800>	and my pimped-out, riced-up, whatever you wanna refer to it as, mate, is now complete.
<homerj>	so if i ever use openvms remotely again, i can use an editor
<halfwit>	oh yeah, night.
<supergeek800>	global menus and a dock for task management, guake for the terminal, compton for the compositor, and a homebrew theme that combines a grayish-color-scheme clearlooks base with the eos window borders and the faenza-cupertino icons.
<charlesatum>	ok, let's see if it works
<charlesatum>	!test
<phrik>	[pass]
<devgrohl>	!test
<phrik>	[fail]
<devgrohl>	haha
<halosghost>	phrik: check if devgrohl is a silly panda

<potmo>	woot speaking to you all from netty the netbook
<lyonsb>	i deeply believe that every single person needs to have *some* public phrik experimentation time.
<halosghost>	lyonsb: oh, sure
<potmo>	is there a nicer implementation of wi-fi for donks like me? i cant seem to ever get that netctl-auto thing to work
<lyonsb>	phrik's roll is kind of ambiguous.(use networkd)
<edit>	:o
<devgrohl>	potmo: nm-applet?
<lyonsb>	^
<halosghost>	lolnetctl
<halosghost>	i'm surprised it's still in base
<potmo>	devgrohl is this answer or question?
<potmo>	ok stop making fun and tell me what to get
<devgrohl>	is an answer with doubts
<halosghost>	phrik: give potmo best
<phrik>	potmo: use whatever suits _you_ best.
<halosghost>	potmo: i use networkd+resolved+wpa_supplicant
<devgrohl>	i'm no expert so i can't give an answer with 100% rate of success
<potmo>	there won't be a lawsuit devgrohl dont worry
<dacoit>	n ∈ !(netctl)
<charlesatum>	lyonsb: let's create #archlinux-bottest
<lyonsb>	nah, we've got /query
<lyonsb>	!query
<phrik>	take that to a /query, please.
<halosghost>	charlesatum: #archlinux-botabuse

<halosghost>	charlesatum: already exissts
<charlesatum>	but that's not public :(

<halosghost>	charlesatum: botabuse is
<charlesatum>	yup, botabuse is, query isn't
<halosghost>	so use botabuse
<halosghost>	phrik: next
<phrik>	another satisfied customer! next!
<lyonsb>	!botabuse
<phrik>	please take that to either a query or #archlinux-botabuse.

<phrik>	title: issue 393395 - chromium - chrome eat all the memory, then system slow like shit - an open-source project to help move the web forward. - google project hosting (at code.google.com)
<charlesatum>	a sincere bug title
<devgrohl>	linx ftw
<devgrohl>	devgrohl: lynx*
<potmo>	i used lynx in 92
<potmo>	was developed at kansas university
<devgrohl>	i born in '92
<potmo>	for the record computer has not yet crashed in spite of chromium and bitlbee and gedit and lxle i am very proud of little netty
<sudokode>	god... you're just barely old enough to get drunk and pick fights with squirrels in the park
<sudokode>	those were the good years
<halosghost>	wait, lynx was developed at ku?
<halosghost>	lol
<sudokode>	tresure them while they last
<potmo>	yes halos
<halosghost>	lol
<halosghost>	no wonder it's so silly
<potmo>	why you laugh?
<halosghost>	because ks is silly
<potmo>	did u invent it or something
<halosghost>	… wut
<devgrohl>	well in this country i'm old enough to do whatever i want~
<halosghost>	devgrohl: not old enough to rent a car yet
<potmo>	lawrence is nice town rest of kansas pretty silly
<halosghost>	potmo: lawrence is silly too
<halosghost>	potmo: i grew up in ks, it's silly
<potmo>	halos are u tryin to pick a fight with me?
<devgrohl>	halosghost: i could rent a car if i had a job,
<potmo>	what part of ks u grow up in halos?
<sudokode>	you're never old enough to take harrison ford in a fight
<halosghost>	devgrohl: most places won't rent you a car until you're around 25
<halosghost>	potmo: salina
<potmo>	no wonder
<halosghost>	lol
<potmo>	i would hate ks too if i grew up in saliva
<halosghost>	ks is silly
<sudokode>	halosghost: that's not uncommon
<halosghost>	sudokode: … i… know?
<devgrohl>	halosghost: in mx its only 21 years
<potmo>	lawrence is nice .. ive travelled all over country and i think lawrence is good place to live
<halosghost>	devgrohl: ¯\o/¯
<sudokode>	halosghost: so why is ks silly?
<halosghost>	potmo: lawrence is way too small for the number of people it contains
<halosghost>	potmo: needs better infrastructure
<potmo>	how long ago were u here?
<halosghost>	potmo: i was born in 92 and lived in ks for 18 years
<potmo>	it's kinda sprawling west and south out of control
<halosghost>	sudokode: keep electing brownback
<potmo>	you were born when i first started using lynx
<halosghost>	sudokode: i don't know why they're so silly
<sudokode>	the last time he saw kansas, there was a tornado, a girl, and a dog
<halosghost>	sudokode: lol
<potmo>	i was bad ass with my mac plus
<halosghost>	sudokode: so original
<chromeeagle>	for new archlinux user... recommended frequency to do system updates?
<potmo>	4 megs ram
<sudokode>	ikr
<halosghost>	chromeeagle: daily/weekly
<sudokode>	wait wait
<sudokode>	brownback?
<potmo>	i was stylin cuz i had a 40 meg external hard drive
<sudokode>	that's just a name begging to be made fun of
<halosghost>	chromeeagle: or, better yet, spam `checkupdates` as often as possible and `-syu` when you see updates
<halosghost>	sudokode: he's a horrible person
<potmo>	yeah i will totally agree with that
<chromeeagle>	gotcha. txs
<potmo>	i mean come on dude science
<devgrohl>	chromeeagle: 1
<devgrohl>	chromeeagle: 1µhz
<chromeeagle>	lol
<chromeeagle>	i was doing 1mhz
<chromeeagle>	i'll step it up
<devgrohl>	chromeeagle: just remember to check what are you updating, sometimes you will wish to know what broke your system
<potmo>	now about that networkd+resolved+wpa_supplicant ...
<devgrohl>	silly ol
<potmo>	if i get the bluetooth and the wifi dialed in i'm good to go
<devgrohl>	networkmanager~ 
<devgrohl>	just kidding nm fails sometimes in boot, but whatever
<potmo>	ok ok i am checking that now
<potmo>	well wifi menu works half the time
<halosghost>	lolnetctl
<potmo>	i remember i did some netctl-auto command each tme
<potmo>	it's what the wiki told me to do
<halosghost>	phrik: give potmo thewiki
<phrik>	potmo: the wiki is full of lies!
<potmo>	yes but it is the finest linux wiki in the world
<devgrohl>	^ +1
<halosghost>	eh
<potmo>	help i am confused
<halosghost>	phrik: give potmo errormsg
<phrik>	potmo: post the _exact_, _verbatim_ error message. paraphrasing, reciting from memory, or otherwise being vague will earn you a swift boot to the head.
<halosghost>	❤
<devgrohl>	turn left in albuquerque
<potmo>	who should i listen to?
<halosghost>	potmo: no one?
<potmo>	phrik !tellmemagicwifisolution
<devgrohl>	potmo: your feelings
<charlesatum>	!g+
<halosghost>	potmo: read about all your options and pick the one that works best for you
<potmo>	i want the one that works
<devgrohl>	listen your kokoro 
<charlesatum>	open your heart
<devgrohl>	kokoro | screw yourself
<halosghost>	potmo: your question could not be answered because it is based on an inaccurate premise
<potmo>	if it works it works best for me
<charlesatum>	nice translation
<potmo>	yes i know look within grasshopper
<potmo>	taht is the one downside of arch being forced to choose between tools all day long
<potmo>	great excuse to not get anything done

<charlesatum>	case-sensitiveness is a bitch
<charlesatum>	!casesensitive
<charlesatum>	nothing? :(
<halosghost>	please don't use slurs
<charlesatum>	oh, right
<devgrohl>	potmo: lowercase()
<charlesatum>	case-sensitive is no good
<potmo>	i have to figure out what to turn off first
<potmo>	i guess i just need to stop netctl-auto?
<devgrohl>	potmo disable & stop netctl
<potmo>	figure it is important to first install then turn off netctl else how will i get package?
<devgrohl>	yep
<devgrohl>	not like you can't it on again when you realize about it
<potmo>	oh i am still connected?
<coffeerage>	hi all; i just installed zsh on a new laptop, and the fade / fire prompts look blocky and not as smooth as on another laptop. i'm stumped as to why
<xyzaffa1r>	i am trying to open docky and there is an error, output: http://sprunge.us/aoyg dbus is installed and running though.
<devgrohl>	coffeerage: with blocky do you mean like when unicode fails or like the font doesnt look smooth
<coffeerage>	devgrohl: not sure about the unicode part -- the color transition in the prompt looks like it has dots. fonts are smooth
<coffeerage>	like this, actually: http://askubuntu.com/questions/495943/zsh-fade-and-fire-prompts-dont-look-so-smooth-in-yakuake-as-in-gnome-terminal
<phrik>	title: kde - zsh fade and fire prompts don't look so smooth in yakuake as in gnome-terminal - ask ubuntu (at askubuntu.com)
<coffeerage>	i'm using terminator
<devgrohl>	ohhh
<coffeerage>	it does look better in gnome-terminal, but i've played around with terminator settings a lot and i'm still not sure why it looks gross here
<devgrohl>	coffeerage: im thinking it could be something in the configurations of colors, like enabling 16bits of color or something like that. let me check
<potmo>	oh dear this looks horribly cojmplicated devgrohl
<coffeerage>	devgrohl: cool, thank you!
<devgrohl>	im almost sure that when i was testing those kinds of prompt i enable somthing like color-256
<coffeerage>	devgrohl: i did set term to xterm-256 but no change
<devgrohl>	then lets check for other
<devgrohl>	walkaround: use termite
<coffeerage>	i'll check that out
<sgtbigman>	termite's default theme is pretty nice as a bonus
<sgtbigman>	depending if one likes a somewhat darker theme :)
<coffeerage>	sgtbigman: i do indeed, installing it now :)
<pandb>	my network interface keeps changing and i'm not sure where to start troubleshooting
<sgtbigman>	coffeerage: i actually think i'd prefer it even a bit darker, but i have been too lazy to change it yet :p
<potmo>	gonna look at this wicd thingy
<coffeerage>	termite doesn't have the blockiness issue, either
<devgrohl>	just to test something
<potmo>	so as long as i dont start the network manager service i dont need to uninstall it or is that incorrect?
<pandb>	it was eno1, then i enabled netctl, set the profile to connect to my ap with eno1, then i rebooted and my interface is now ra1
<pandb>	ra0, i mean
<potmo>	they're going to say hahaha netctl
<devgrohl>	coffeerage: try this from some terminal terminator -e "term=xterm-256color pine"
<devgrohl>	potmo: correct
<potmo>	cuz i think this wicd is more my style
<pandb>	i haven't been able to figure out how to get my network up and running automatically, so i keep having to manually invoke wpa_supplicant and dhcpcd
<pandb>	i've been reading about systemctl, but i'm still not sure what to do or how to properly troubleshoot my problems
<devgrohl>	i don't know why so much problems, i always install nm-applet and networkmanager
<coffeerage>	devgrohl: terminator starts then crashes because it can't bind hide_window key; i found that from a search earlier as well :-/
<devgrohl>	lel change to termite, its pretty cool and easy to config
<jushur>	pandb: you can install networkmanager-tui
<devgrohl>	its like gnome-terminal + vim
<jushur>	pandb: console gui to networkmanager
<devgrohl>	but the vim part is not needed to use it
<coffeerage>	yeah i'm reading about termite's visual block mode etc.
<coffeerage>	that sounds quite nifty
<pandb>	i dont mind vim, i use it
<sgtbigman>	devgrohl: do you know of an easy way to get alt-arrow functionality in termite similar to gnome-terminal?
<coffeerage>	i think i will just try switching... thanks devgrohl & sgtbigman for termite suggestion!
<devgrohl>	phrik: next
<phrik>	another satisfied customer! next!
<aaronm04>	arch users, what's your favorite open-source game?
<sgtbigman>	aaronm04: i've read good things about tuxcart, but haven't tried it myself :p
<pandb>	i just wish i could figure out why my network interface keeps changing across reboots
<devgrohl>	sgtbigman: i cant remember what alt-arrow do
<sgtbigman>	devgrohl: apologies. at least for irssi, it allow easy navigation between windows
<sgtbigman>	better than typing /window # :p
<aaronm04>	sgtbigman: thanks! i'll try it :)
<sgtbigman>	probably something i can search easily, but figured i'd ask
<coffeerage>	pandb: something with the udev naming rules maybe
<devgrohl>	sgtbigman: since im using termite in i3, i have no need for that functionality cause i3 provides it
<coffeerage>	pandb: have you seen: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/network_configuration#device_names ?
<phrik>	title: network configuration - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<pandb>	i'm there right now
<coffeerage>	anything in udev/rules.d?
<sgtbigman>	devgrohl: oh, i am using i3 :p
<pandb>	i made a udev rule but i doesn't seem to take
<devgrohl>	sgtbigman: why dont use $mod-arrow, isn't that the same func?
<pandb>	i made a 10-network.rules in that folder with the name
<pandb>	it consists of this line: subsystem=="net", action=="add", attr{address}=="80:56:f2:6f:8f:c7", name="w_w"
<coffeerage>	hmm
<sgtbigman>	devgrohl: ah, no, i meant switching between irssi 'windows'
<sgtbigman>	i just have irssi open in a tmux pane :p
<coffeerage>	pandb: mac address for device isn't changing across reboots?
<pandb>	no, it's been the same every time i've checked
<sgtbigman>	i'm sure i can find something, but wanted to see if i was missing something simple :)
<sgtbigman>	thanks
<agent_white>	evenin
<coffeerage>	that's quite bizarre pandb, i'm not sure. i may have missed part of what you said; are they changing schemes completely or just the device numbers?
<pandb>	'schemes?'
<pandb>	im just seeing the device number change
<coffeerage>	gotcha
<pandb>	i've also seen other people mention that sort of thing on the forums
<pandb>	i've probably just been careless with installing things
<pandb>	if i want to get rid of netctl, would something like `systemctl disable netctl && pacman -r netctl` be sufficient?
<sgtbigman>	devgrohl: yeah, apologies, i wasn't thinking straight...of course alt-arrow won't work in irssi since alt is the mod key for i3 :p
<devgrohl>	:p i was doing research to know what i missed
<devgrohl>	pandb: i highly recommend -rns <package>
<pandb>	thanks
<devgrohl>	l8 fellas
<devgrohl>	this.sleep();
<dacoit>	this->
<b80905>	how do i create a user that can only run a certain program and nothing else?
<dacoit>	seems like a pain in the ass. i would use some kind of chroot jail
<junka>	is dhcpcd needed after the installation?
<iflema>	junka: ill show you the door...
<junka>	iflema; what door
<iflema>	come
<pandb>	before i google(and consult the wiki), does anyone have recommendations for learning udev and/or systemd?
<iflema>	pandb: use em

<supergeek800>	mainline won't boot, but i did manage to copy down some of the kernel panic info:
<supergeek800>	 general protection fault: 0000 [#1] preempt smp
<supergeek800>	222 comm: xorg tainted: g                    c
<supergeek800>	4.0 stable kernel got similar info, iirc.
<potmo>	woot woot woot wicd ftw
<grandpatrolling>	who is general protection fault?
<grandpatrolling>	and why does his name sound funny
<junka>	potmo; pls
<supergeek800>	um, that's some of the kernel panic info on mainline i could copy down, which may or may not apply to my 4.0 woes too.
<grandpatrolling>	before android 4.1, method int android.support.v7.internal.widget.listviewcompat.lookforselectableposition(int, boolean) would have incorrectly overridden the package-private method in android.widget.listview
<supergeek800>	just wanna see what you can put together out of it.
<grandpatrolling>	i'm computer illiterate
<supergeek800>	in the main support chat for arch.
<dacoit>	general protection fault is kernel panic's co
<grandpatrolling>	i see
<junka>	i cant see other workstations on my local network, do i miss something?
<sgtbigman>	what is going on in this chat all the sudden
<supergeek800>	what could be made of the xorg tainted error message?
<supergeek800>	(either way, my days on arch are likely numbered on this machine at least)
<grandpatrolling>	it needs to be purified
<grandpatrolling>	quick, grab the holy water!~
<dan39>	supergeek800: gfx card going bad?
<supergeek800>	dan39: more like the whole damn computer is too anemic for anything newer than maybe ubuntu 12.04 without error.
<grandpatrolling>	freebsd.
<supergeek800>	actually, scratch that, it could run 14.04 until it reaches eol, or worst-case, centos.
<dan39>	ewww
<pandb>	why is centos disliked?
<supergeek800>	because it's ancient.
<dacoit>	i like centos
<supergeek800>	and that, ubuntu lts, debian stable, or slack are probably the only distros left that i know this piece of shit can run.
<dacoit>	not liking it because its "ancient" is stupid, thats the whole damn point. fedora -> redhat -> centos
<dan39>	supergeek800: you are not making sense
<dan39>	you just need to find drivers id think
<supergeek800>	dan39: my computer is likely too old for 4.x.x, r300 graphics on here.
<dan39>	no idea
<supergeek800>	unless i can get my hands on a low-profile gpu that can handle 4.0.
<dan39>	get a new computer ffs
<dan39>	i get free ones often that run arch fine
<supergeek800>	you've no idea how badly i wanna get one, however i'mma have to either take my chances with the trash, and likely get one that's busted, or save up for a soc build once i'm able to.
<dan39>	:|
<supergeek800>	which, come to think of it, i could probably stick a soc board in here and be cool for a while.
<dan39>	meh
<supergeek800>	(but the case is btx, so dunno if it'd fit or not)
<supergeek800>	dan39: it cut it short, the only options i've really have left thus far on this thing, are lts distros or a return to win.
<kurobeats>	hey guys, just wondering how i can change/set the network device names to be like wlan0/1/2/etc rather than the wlp2s0 it is
<dacoit>	kurobeats: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/network_configuration#change_device_name
<phrik>	title: network configuration - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<kurobeats>	cheers
<kurobeats>	the current config break aircrack-ng and friends
<dacoit>	i recommend not eth/wlan though, that reintroduces the problems that the weird names solve
<dacoit>	race conditions between kernel/udev
<dacoit>	i think the wiki says as much in clearer terms
<kurobeats>	yeah i just saw that.
<kurobeats>	yeah
<kurobeats>	i might raise it with the aircrack-ng team instead
<dacoit>	thats probably the right course of action, it shouldnt break for something like that
<diegoviola>	gnome is not too bad with some extensions
<diegoviola>	i'm impressed how easy it is to add them, just a switch away
<diegoviola>	what are their extensions written in? how does that actually work?
<dacoit>	javascript i think
<dacoit>	for gnome shell atleast
<diegoviola>	ok
<lswart>	does anyone have feedback about installing adobe flash? it seems that it's not supported anymore, but is it the best option? i've heard of gnash, although it's in beta. any feedback about which one performs better, or whether there is a better alternative?
<diegoviola>	that alternatetab fixed my annoyance with gnome
<v3nturetheworld>	uhh...theres one for chrome/chromium.
<dacoit>	lswart: sure its supported
<v3nturetheworld>	pepper-flash is the name
<dacoit>	chromium-pepper-flash + chromium, or google-chrome, or chromium-pepper-flash + freshplayer + firefox
<v3nturetheworld>	if you want to watch drm flash content thats a different story...
<v3nturetheworld>	you'll need hal-flash i think its called, at least thats what i used for hbo go
<xyzaffa1r>	my sound is doing some wonky stuff, for some reason things don't make sound unless i set them to at last around 35% volume.
<xyzaffa1r>	i am using pulseaudio
<xyzaffa1r>	and pavucontrol for volume settings.
<v3nturetheworld>	you mean it doesn't play sound above or below 35%?
<xyzaffa1r>	below
<xyzaffa1r>	if it is below 35 it makes no noise.
<v3nturetheworld>	huh...interesting
<xyzaffa1r>	yeah.
<xyzaffa1r>	can't listen to anything because my headphones are loud and 35% is unbearable.
<xyzaffa1r>	this is a fresh arch install.
<lswart>	dacoit: thanks, i'm looking into it :-)
<v3nturetheworld>	try amixer -d pulse sset master 5%- a few times
<v3nturetheworld>	did that work xyzaffa1r
<xyzaffa1r>	v3nturetheworld, sorry i will get back, i just tried things, will answer in a second.
<xyzaffa1r>	v3nturetheworld, i am going to restart because it looks like i messed up pulse more :)
<xyzaffa1r>	be right back
<xyzaffa1r>	before i restart because this is annoying actually, every time i start up there is this 1:30 minute timer before it actually start.s
<xyzaffa1r>	what't that all about?
<xyzaffa1r>	now pulse wont start at all
<supergeek800>	i may go to win7 on this hardware until i can get hardware that'll run a fully-updated arch.
<xyzaffa1r>	e: [pulseaudio] main.c: daemon startup failed.
<supergeek800>	how would that be for a strategy to hold me over on this hardware until it becomes truly useless?
<v3nturetheworld>	hmmm
<v3nturetheworld>	did you check the journalctl logs on it xyzaffa1r?
<xyzaffa1r>	v3nturetheworld, not a clue what that is.
<supergeek800>	v3nturetheworld: if you want in, planning on going back to win temporarily just to have a somewhat-usable system again, if 14.04 don't work out.
<v3nturetheworld>	and what is this timer? is it on boot? like before your desktop environment loads or whatever?
<v3nturetheworld>	uhhh what?
<v3nturetheworld>	lol
<supergeek800>	v3nturetheworld: either way, arch's days on this machine are over fast, can't boot anything newer than kernel 3.19.
<xyzaffa1r>	v3nturetheworld, the timer is before i get to the tty.
<supergeek800>	i'm off now.
<v3nturetheworld>	huh thats weird? any idea why?
<xyzaffa1r>	on boot.
<supergeek800>	graphics are too old.
<supergeek800>	r300.
<v3nturetheworld>	lol, thats the weirdest thing i've heard xyzaffa1r
<supergeek800>	anyways, seriously, off.
<xyzaffa1r>	v3nturetheworld, yeah, no idea what it is.
<v3nturetheworld>	two things i can think of...check your ~/.bash/bin, though if the problem is being caused there then every time you open a terminal it should happen
<v3nturetheworld>	the other is something in your .xinit file
<xyzaffa1r>	so what about pulse though?
<v3nturetheworld>	what desktop environment are you running?
<xyzaffa1r>	not running one.
<v3nturetheworld>	oh...hmmm
<xyzaffa1r>	here is the output of just "pulse"
<xyzaffa1r>	here is the output of just "pulseaudio"
<xyzaffa1r>	oops
<xyzaffa1r>	http://sprunge.us/agdr
<v3nturetheworld>	so the command i told you crashed it?
<xyzaffa1r>	what command sorry?
<v3nturetheworld>	amixer -d pulse sset master 5%-
<v3nturetheworld>	though it looks like a different error...
<yitz_>	some aur maintainers aren't very good at fleshing out the depends and makedepends lists
<xyzaffa1r>	bash: amixer: command not found
<xyzaffa1r>	oh
<xyzaffa1r>	installed it this time :)
<v3nturetheworld>	kk
<xyzaffa1r>	v3nturetheworld, alsa lib pulse.c:243:(pulse_connect) pulseaudio: unable to connect: connection refused
<xyzaffa1r>	amixer: mixer attach pulse error: connection refused
<v3nturetheworld>	hmmm
<xyzaffa1r>	[wolfgang@sawyer ~]$ pulseaudio --start
<xyzaffa1r>	e: [pulseaudio] main.c: daemon startup failed.
<xyzaffa1r>	cant launch pulse...
<v3nturetheworld>	systemctl --user enable pulseaudio.socket
<dustmote>	does anybody know if disabling the applesmc module is going to do bad things?
<switchy>	dustmote, why would you want to?
<v3nturetheworld>	idk, it seems like your pulse audio module.c is out of date or something xyzaffa1r
<v3nturetheworld>	have you tried reinstalling it?
<dustmote>	switchy, brightd won't dim my screen because my computer (evidently) has a motion sensor in it (macbookpro7,1)
<dustmote>	switchy, i'm also trying to use brightd's filters.. that might be just the ticket ...one sec
<switchy>	dustmote, i'm pretty sure you don't need to disable the whole smc just to disable adaptive brightness
<v3nturetheworld>	uhh? i have a macbook air...im not using the sensor just manually controlling brightness unless lid closes
<dustmote>	switchy: sure, but it's the only effective workaround i've found so far :)
<dustmote>	v3nturetheworld: yeah, that's nice too
<dustmote>	v3nturetheworld: i'll set that up eventually
<v3nturetheworld>	dustmote: if i remember is was easier then dealing with the automatic stuff lol.
<v3nturetheworld>	just bind xbacklight -inc 10 or -dec 10 to keys
<switchy>	yeah, i just had some binds to xbacklight in my i3 config, if i remember correctly
<dustmote>	v3nturetheworld: well, i've got it most of the way there, so if i can avoid doing it manually i don't ever have to think about it again hopefuly
<dustmote>	it looks like brightd's -e option is a whitelist which matches event filenames in /dev/input/by-* so...
<v3nturetheworld>	dustmote, yeah i guess. personally i got annoyed with it changing light levels all the time in weird lighting settings so i disabled it on the osx side as well xd
<kevr>	not sure there's an answer for this. been battling with it for some time now, but, while i'm using pulseaudio with mpd and other applications, noises from other applications stop the sound from mpd. like, if i'm on chromium and sound starts there, mpd's music just stops. is there a way to force pulseaudio to not allow conflicts and just let programs be perfectly standalone?
<kevr>	that is, only if they're going to the same sound output.
<dustmote>	v3nturetheworld: :) i'm like all about battery savings, so i guess it doesn't bother me as much
<dustmote>	v3nturetheworld: what did you use to bind xbacklight to things? just modify your wm settings or smth?
<v3nturetheworld>	dustmote, what desktop manager are you using? also have you seen https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/macbook#light_sensor
<phrik>	title: macbook - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<v3nturetheworld>	im using the built in xkce key binding thing, i had it set up with i3wm as well but i dont exactly remember how its done there, i do remember it being easy though
<dustmote>	v3nturetheworld: i use ratpoison
<dustmote>	v3nturetheworld: got it working! `brightd -vxf -w10 -b1 -e 'kbd|mouse'`
<dustmote>	v3nturetheworld: whitelists events from kbd or mouse in `tree /dev/input`
<v3nturetheworld>	nice! also i actually hadn't heard of ratpoisen before lol
<chamuco_>	kevr have you confirmed if mpd and pulseaudio are being ran as the same user?
<kevr>	yep
<kevr>	both under the same user.
<chamuco_>	kevr see the global configuration post here on how to run mpd as its own user https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/music_player_daemon#global_configuration
<phrik>	title: music player daemon - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<dustmote>	v3nturetheworld: i use it b/c i have one computer with a screen so tiny that there's no point to ever show more than one thing at a time
<dustmote>	v3nturetheworld: anyhow, thanks.. night!
<chamuco_>	kevr according to another user this workaround fixed the issue https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=188965

<grawity>	qqqqqqqqq9: yes
<kevr>	chamuco_: i'm already running both pulseaudio and mpd as the same user. i'm starting mpd after pulseaudio. d-bus units are loaded properly and running.
<kevr>	chamuco_: as far as i can tell, the workaround mentioned there is to fix a global mpd user being used
<kevr>	which, in my case, it isn't. i'm starting it directly as my user, not a service unit
<kevr>	i might be lost or just missing something, though, that's as far as i can tell, so far.
<wolter>	phrik: this solutions didn't work for me :-/
<wolter>	v3nturetheworld: this solutions didn't work for me :-/
<chamuco_>	kevr what is the output of ls -l /var/lib/mpd
<kevr>	an empty playlists folder
<wolter>	i have tried to set the locale, although when i enter command locale, most of my locale settings are not en_us; i guess its some configuration on my home directory but i can't tell which file.
<kevr>	all of my mpd files are stored in ~/.config/mpd
<chamuco_>	kevr ls -l should have displayed the user and group
<kevr>	as per my ~/.mpd.conf, which i'll paste in a sec
<kevr>	chamuco_: it's owned by mpd, but mpd is not currently using that folder for my session
<kevr>	at all
<kevr>	that's left there from a while ago; it might as well be empty
<chamuco_>	kevr when you say mpd is not using that folder at all for your session, you mean its not playing music from that directory correct?
<kevr>	no, i mean it's not storing anything in that directory.
<kevr>	in my .mpd.conf, i set all those files to $home/.config/mpd/...
<kevr>	and my music is located in $home/music
<chamuco_>	ok in that case is ~/.config/mpd owned by mpd or as you?
<kevr>	owned by me
<kevr>	not mpd
<chamuco_>	ok for my understanding to the work around mpd should have permissions to write to that file
<kevr>	it does.
<wolter>	my touchpad settings are not detected by gnome, how can i fix this?
<nkparadox>	kevr, whats your problem with mpd? i might be able to help
<kevr>	let's say i'm running mpd as user a, the directory and all the files inside are owned by user a
<chamuco_>	chown -r mpd $home/.config/mpd in your case
<grawity>	wait wait why
<kevr>	chamuco_: mpd is not running as user mpd.
<chamuco_>	kevr is mpd running under your user name?
<kevr>	yes.
<kevr>	nkparadox: basically, i'm running mpd and a few other applications, which all use pulseaudio, and are all using the same output source. but, when the other applications have sound, it pauses mpd briefly, and the other programs interrupt the sound coming out of mpd.
<nkparadox>	kevr, you dont need to specify a user ! mpd will run under the current user if you comment out this line
<kevr>	i'm not specifying the user at all.
<kevr>	i'm running it under my user. like you say.
<kevr>	sorry, it doesn't pause mpd, but the sound coming from mpd is drowned out
<kevr>	by other sounds.
<kevr>	i would like it to work completely standalone.
<chamuco_>	kevr can you please post your mpd.conf file?
<wolter>	v3nturetheworld: do you know how can i fix the locale issue?
<kevr>	chamuco_: http://sprunge.us/lxik
<kevr>	using a hardware mixer_type does the same thing.
<v3nturetheworld>	wolter, im not sure honostly. i'm off to sleep but im sure someone else can help, otherwise google around a bit and seee if theres a fix
<nkparadox>	kevr, how about if you comment out mixer line
<kevr>	oh jesus mother of satan
<kevr>	that was loud.
<kevr>	let's see.
<wolter>	ok, my touchpad and locale issues are solved; now my only problem is i cannot run gnome-terminal. i have all sublocales set to en_us.utf-8 and i have installed vte (vte3), but still my gnome terminal won't launch
<qqqqqqqqq9>	quit
<kevr>	yeah, it's still doing it
<nkparadox>	wolter, dont forget to regenarate your locale
<wolter>	nkparadox: after regeneration, do i have to reboot or just relog in?
<al2o3-cr>	wolter: reboot
<nkparadox>	nkparadox, here whats the problem ! usually when a music program starts it launch a pulse-audio server that claims the sound device and the other programs are failing to use it!
<nkparadox>	kevr, that was for you
<tomty89>	only if "other programs" does not support pulse natively and pulseaudio-alsa is not installed
<kevr>	i've got pulseaudio-alsa
<tomty89>	do you have and ~/.asoundrc
<kevr>	the other programs causing the slight interruptions are just chromium and skype, pretty much the only programs with sound i use aside from mpd
<tomty89>	*an
<kevr>	tomty89: i do not
<tomty89>	interruption?
<wolter>	rebooted but still terminal throws the same error :-(
<kevr>	i have an /etc/asound.conf, though.
<kevr>	right.
<tomty89>	kevr: that's pulseaudio-alsa
<kevr>	ah.
<tomty89>	unless you modified it
<kevr>	i didn't. however, i just found a fix
<kevr>	oddly
<kevr>	posted here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1981967
<phrik>	title: [solved] mpd behaves weird with pulse audio (at ubuntuforums.org)
<kevr>	not sure why that would even fix that issue, but for sure
<al2o3-cr>	wolter: what error?
<kevr>	thanks for your guys efforts, regardless. i appreciate it.
<nkparadox>	kevr, cheers
<tomty89>	guess mpd have to made sure to point to a certain pulse server? not familiar of mpd
<wolter>	al2o3-cr: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/10995459/ (although now i am not getting lines 2 and 3)
<phrik>	title: ubuntu pastebin (at pastebin.ubuntu.com)
<kevr>	yeah i guess so :p
<tomty89>	wolter: what locale are you using
<al2o3-cr>	wolter: issue: localectl set-locale lang=en_us.utf-8 then reboot? # had this problem yesterday
<detrix42>	hello all. i am toying around with an odroid. i have installed archlinux and it works great, but when i do 'pacman -syu' i upgrade the u-boot and is re-fused to the emmc, and then my network does not come up on boot.  i can manually bring it up.  i am using systemd-networkd to manage the network.  what file is responsible for bring the network interface up on boot?
<wolter>	al2o3-cr: you did? i already did that :-/
<tomty89>	wolter: have you gen it?
<wolter>	tomty89: yes, already
<nkparadox>	wolter, post locale -a pls
<junka>	i uncommented the nameserver in /etc/resolvconf.conf but do i have to run resolvconf -u on every boot?
<tomty89>	wat
<wolter>	nkparadox: 3 lines: c, en_us.utf8, posix
<wolter>	should second line be en_us.utf-8?
<nkparadox>	yeah
<tomty89>	nah
<wolter>	hahah
<nkparadox>	im pretty sure it should be like taht
<tomty89>	nah nah nah
<wolter>	nkparadox: is yours?
<tomty89>	not even in localectl list-locales
<kevr>	localectl list-locales gives me en_us.utf8
<kevr>	and localectl itself shows me en_us.utf-8
<kevr>	so
<junka>	wolter; it is normal
<tomty89>	kevr: because you set it so
<kevr>	ye
<tomty89>	but any "translated" output will be "utf8"
<kevr>	for sure
<tomty89>	it might not be ideal, but normal
<wolter>	when i run localectl status, the first line i get says: system locale: lang=en_us.utf-8
<wolter>	is that lang= thing ok?
<tomty89>	wolter: you see anything different in `locale`?
<tomty89>	i mean different as others
<tomty89>	not the small/big letter hyphen thing
<wolter>	tomty89: lang= is set to en_us.utf-8; all other values are en_us.utf8
<tomty89>	that should be alright
<kevr>	wolter: ditto here, and my locale is setup fine.
<kevr>	seems legit
<wolter>	hm... how can i further debug this?
<tomty89>	google
<wolter>	how weird... this is a fresh install and i already have to report a bug :-(
<nkparadox>	wolter try going to gnome preferences and set locale from there
<nkparadox>	wolter, ^
<nkparadox>	wolter, gnome might overwrite this stuff sometimes
<nkparadox>	wolter, preferences> region and language
<dx>	hi #archlinux, trying to configure ipv6 inside my lan. it works in the router pc, just not in the others. "ip -6 route list" shows "default via fe80::..." - is it okay to have a link-local address there?
<wolter>	nkparadox: should i try to change the values and then restore them to en us, or just clicking on them would do?
<wolter>	i don't think any other language or country shows in gnome-preferences :-/
<tomty89>	maybe try removing your dconf *shrug*
<nkparadox>	wolter, cant you rearrange them?
<wolter>	tomty89: what do you mean?
<wolter>	nkparadox: no, can't seem to
<wolter>	nkparadox: there is only english for language and united states for country
<tomty89>	well except your /etc/locale.conf, that's what gnome might manipulate on your locale
<tomty89>	and that also store settings/preference of your gnome apps
<dustmote>	xbacklight grumble grumble
<wolter>	tomty89: but should i rename a file/folder or something?
<al2o3-cr>	wolter: did you say you already edited /etc/locale.gen?
<tomty89>	personally i find it harmless to rm -r .config/dconf
<tomty89>	just you might need to set stuff again
<tomty89>	and i'll do it before login in an tty
<tomty89>	but that might be paranoid
<nkparadox>	wolter,  do you have a .dmrc file?
<tekken>	tomty89: i prefer rm -r /home/user
<tekken>	get a nice fresh start.
<tomty89>	heh
<kevr>	chill brah, some noob might just do that
<kevr>	:\
<tomty89>	i prefer userdel -r and useradd -m
<dustmote>	so i have a monitor with backlight support, but when i use xbacklight it just prints a stupid error to xorg log: "display (apple (dfp-0)) does not support nvidia 3d vision stereo."
<tekken>	kevr: we don't use the noob term anymore.... we use diaper fresh.
<tomty89>	dustmote: do you have a generated stupid xorg conf?
<tekken>	isn't xorg.conf basically deprecated?
<dustmote>	tomty89: hmm.. i basically haven't done anything with xorg conf for ages
<dustmote>	tomty89: so i'm using whatever is default in there? i can look the xorg log to see what the monitor section looks like..
<dustmote>	tomty89: it doesn't print the default monitor section in the xorg log; it just says it's using the default monitor section :d
<kevr>	chill brah, some diaper fresh person might just do that
<wolter>	nkparadox: yes
<tekken>	much better.
<wolter>	pastebin?
<tomty89>	dustmote: bah paste your xorg log or check your /etc/x11
<wolter>	meh, just says [desktop]\nsession=gnome
<detrix42>	hello all. i am toying around with an odroid. i have installed archlinux and it works great, but when i do 'pacman -syu' i upgrade the u-boot and is re-fused to the emmc, and then my network does not come up on boot.  i can manually bring it up.  i am using systemd-networkd to manage the network.  what file is responsible for bring the network interface up on boot?
<tomty89>	detrix42: how do you use systemd-networkd
<detrix42>	tomty89: with systemctl
<nkparadox>	wolter, so you got gdm ? if yes try selecting locale (i believe you can )  in loggin screen and if it asks you to save it as default answer yes!
<thenumb>	detrix42: /j #archlinux-arm
<tomty89>	detrix42: do you have a network file in /etc/systemd/network
<tomty89>	nkparadox: ugh?
<wolter>	nkparadox: ok brb
<wolter>	without reboot?
<tomty89>	nkparadox: i think that's something only exists eras ago?
<detrix42>	tomty89: yes
<tekken>	i found a hard apple cider in the fridge.
<nkparadox>	wolter, yeah with out
<tekken>	much less bored now.
<tomty89>	detrix42: actually networkd should bring it up normally
<tomty89>	detrix42: paste your network file, or `journalctl -b`
<tomty89>	btw is this an alarm question
<tomty89>	!give detrix42 alarm
<phrik>	detrix42: if you're here because of an issue with your raspberry pi or other arm device, join #archlinux-arm.
<wolter>	nkparadox: i didn't see any option to pick locale
<tomty89>	heh
<detrix42>	tomty89: thanks, i will go to archlinux-arm...
<tomty89>	he is talking about the gdm in red hat 9 i think...
<tomty89>	wolter: btw did you also set your locale in some shell profile or rc files
<wolter>	tomty89: .profile
<tomty89>	what's the terminal you're using? gnome-terminal?
<tomty89>	eh
<wolter>	tomty89: yes
<tekken>	would pxe be useful on a day to day basis type deal?
<tomty89>	wolter: what else in your .profile?
<tomty89>	i don't recall if it would be sourced by default though...
<dustmote>	tomty89: bah .. i can't paste the bpaste link into here because i haven't remaped anything to the insert key yet
<jushur>	dx: all network interfaces has a link-local address on ipv6, its designed such.
<tekken>	dustmote: you can't shift+insert?
<tomty89>	!give dustmote ix
<phrik>	dustmote: curl -f 'f:1=<-' ix.io
<dustmote>	tekken: no insert key; macbookpro7,1
<wolter>	tomty89: my gpg key, a conditioned bash command and "export lc_all="en_us.utf-8"
<tekken>	oh dear...
<tekken>	mac's are strange.
<tomty89>	wolter: try to remove that export
<wolter>	but i logged to my wayland session and i see locale output changed; let me go back to normal session
<wolter>	tomty89: ok
<dustmote>	tomty89: ix.io/ijw
<dustmote>	tomty89: the errors at the bottom are basically printed every time i do xbacklight
<tekken>	i've still not bothered to test wayland yet...
<wolter>	tomty89: my [$ locale] output is still messed up, now a different locale that i used to use (i have migrated my home directory) shows up. where could this other locale be called up?
<wolter>	tekken: its progressed lots
<tomty89>	wolter: messed up how?
<wolter>	tomty89: the thing about the different locale; i'll pastebin
<wolter>	tomty89: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/10995884/
<phrik>	title: ubuntu pastebin (at pastebin.ubuntu.com)
<tomty89>	dustmote: so xbacklight itself doesn't give you any error?
<jushur>	wolter: put each of the following on a own line in /etc/locale.conf  lang=en_us.utf-8 lc_time=en_us.utf-8 lc_collate=c change to your preffered language if you like..
<tomty89>	wolter: /etc/locale.conf
<dustmote>	tomty89: nope
<tomty89>	jushur: nooo
<dustmote>	tomty89: no output atall
<jushur>	tomty89: no?
<dustmote>	tomty89: no retcode
<wolter>	tomty89: lang=en_us.utf-8
<wolter>	jushur: will do
<jushur>	tomty89: why no?
<tomty89>	jushur: you use lang if you want all to be the same, and set those specific one only if you want it to be different
<tomty89>	wolter: only line?
<tomty89>	hmm
<jushur>	tomty89: read my post again..
<wolter>	tomty89: yes
<wolter>	i'll wait for you too to agree haha
<jushur>	wolter: sound aproach ;)
<tomty89>	wolter: you want all of them to be en_us.utf-8 right?
<tomty89>	wolter: you don't recall when you set en_cr.utf-8?
<wolter>	tomty89: yes, until i get gnome-terminal; then i'll see if i can make my en_cr locale work
<wolter>	tomty89: in my previous, ubuntu install
<tomty89>	wat
<tomty89>	share /home?
<wolter>	i brought home with me unchanged
<wolter>	yes
<wolter>	i replaced ubuntu with arch
<wolter>	but left home untouched
<tomty89>	well, must be some thing in ~ then
<sunstar>	bad idea
<wolter>	:-s
<tomty89>	no idea what ubuntu did
<wolter>	what should i remove, any idea?
<sunstar>	ubuntu stores all kinds stuff in /home
<wolter>	or what should i leave hahaha
<tomty89>	all .dotfiles?
<sunstar>	^
<wolter>	tomty89: even .local ?
<tomty89>	unless there are some super specific setting or cache you want to preserve
<wolter>	or dotfiles as in not dotdirs?
<grawity>	uhhh
<grawity>	tomty89: weren't you the one who liked to spam !reinstall
<grawity>	why are you suggesting to nuke all old settings now
<tomty89>	that's a joke

<cptstabington>	hey
<tomty89>	wolter: or create another user
<wolter>	tomty89: yeah
<tomty89>	move it bit by bit *shrug*
<dustmote>	tomty89: xbacklight doesn't give output or any returncode.. any ideas?
<wolter>	tomty89: the new user seems like a testcase method, i like it; useradd -m -g wheel thompson ?
<tomty89>	dustmote: oh sorry, that means 0?
<cptstabington>	i have a question about pacman
<tekken>	does wayland not like the nvidia blob?
<tomty89>	wolter: that's what i'll do, but -g wheel might be controversial
<tekken>	lol.
<tomty89>	tekken: kms is not ready yet
<tomty89>	dustmote: what i thought is, maybe the error is irrelevant
<cptstabington>	is there a reason for it not being able to simultaneously download a package while installing another?
<grawity>	tekken: the nvidia blob does most of its work in the xorg ddx
<grawity>	tekken: which naturally cannot work with wayland
<grawity>	cptstabington: nobody considered it useful enough to implement
<tomty89>	dustmote: it's just some routine warning, but not relevant to the fact that xbacklight does not work
<cptstabington>	i think the speed would increase quite a bit by that
<dustmote>	tomty89: yes, it seems irrelevant, but it prints once for each time i run xbacklight
<dustmote>	:-/
<dustmote>	tomty89: nothing on google about it
<tekken>	i've not poked at the nouveau driver much as of late.
<dustmote>	that's relevant, that is.
<grawity>	tomty89: nothing wrong with -g wheel, it's the usual "can su/sudo" group
<cptstabington>	i'm not a programmer tho, so i wouldn't know how to implement that. just been wondering :p
<tomty89>	grawity: glad to hear
<wolter>	tomty89: i'm going to test thompson
<tomty89>	that's how i do with sudo
<tomty89>	dustmote: actually you can see that in as well [    13.550]
<anruscher>	hello guys
<tomty89>	dustmote: btw have you tried some more primitive method to deal with backlight first?
<shanemikel>	!hello
<phrik>	hello? http://i.imgur.com/8pwtf.gif
<dustmote>	tomty89: yeah, the backlight works by writing to /sys/class/backlight/nvidia_backlight/blah/blah..
<tomty89>	hmm
<dustmote>	tomty89: but xbacklight seems to be people's preferred way to respond to keys
<tomty89>	dustmote: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/backlight

<anruscher>	can anybody help me with my blinking screen? after my girlfriend killed my laptop by hard poweroff the whole screen is flashing...i have no idea how to fix this. in tty there is flicking but on x server
<tomty89>	dustmote: it mentioned about not working xbacklight, there should be an error though
<tomty89>	dustmote: maybe it just pick intel_backlight or so which doesn't work and not giving you any error?
<dustmote>	tomty89: there's only one directory under /sys/class/backlight
<dustmote>	tomty89: nvidia_backlight
<tomty89>	oh
<tomty89>	did you run xbacklight as root? not sure if it's necessary though
<tomty89>	dustmote: and can you at least -get the backlight?
<dustmote>	tomty89: tried as root; doesn't work
<dustmote>	tomty89: -get or no -get .. no difference
<tomty89>	seems it ignores nvidia_backlight
<wolter>	tomty89, nkparadox and jushur: good news; its something in my home directory
<dustmote>	tomty89: yeah, i guess that would be a viable explanation
<dustmote>	hmm..
<wolter>	tomty89: i'm going to lay all my baggage to thompson and get myself a clean home
<tomty89>	wolter: <3
<wolter>	i wish the gnome-terminal error was a bit more expressive though
<tomty89>	dustmote: sorry can't help. maybe you can file a bug report, or just write a little script :)
<tomty89>	wolter: actually if you have generated en_cr.utf8, that error might not come up
<wolter>	tomty89: hmm... perhaps
<tomty89>	but obviously something not very nice is messing your locale, and in arch you only need to manipulate locale.conf for system-wide locales
<dustmote>	tomty89: sounds good! :)
<tomty89>	wolter: (well and locale[.-]gen)
<dustmote>	tomty89:  thanks for looking into it with me

<mads->	can anyone help me out here? i have made a vpn connection to my school. and under "ip addr" i see a new device, tun0, which seems to be working fine. i have connected with openconnect. but it seems like my computer still just want to use my own ethernet. how do i tell it to use the tun0 device? when i run curl --interface tun0 checkip.dyndns.org it actually shows the ip of the vpn. but when i visit the site in firefox, it shows my own ip
<ecraven>	mads-: you need to add a route
<ecraven>	does ip route show a default route?
<mrelendig>	mads-: man ip-route
<ecraven>	either you want a split tunnel, where you add specific routes just for some networks, or you remove the default route and add a new one (something like ip route add default dev tun0) to tunnel all traffic over that device

<grawity>	trivia_man: are they the same size? `dd` the whole disk
<mrelendig>	or rsync
<grawity>	trivia_man: otherwise, rsync & reinstall the bootloader

<trolleader>	i rather reinstall than dd

<ecraven>	ip route del <paste the one you want to delete, probably the second>
<trivia_man>	grawity: my plan was to install arch onto my usb through virtualbox, but when i needed to select the partitions to install to, i selected the virtualbox one, instead of my 16gb usb
<trolleader>	why make a virtual disk which you're not gonna use
<grawity>	because virtualbox does that by default
<grawity>	since 99.999% of vbox users are going to need it

<jackwinter_>	am looking at implementing some kind of lsm support on my systems.  anyone know why apparmor needs a kernel other than the distro kernel?  is it a question of audit support, if so is any progress being made on audit and namespace support so that we can get audit support in the distro kernel again?
<mrelendig>	jackwinter_: use pax/grs
<grawity>	jackwinter_: because apparmor is a kernel feature that the distro kernel doesn't enable
<grawity>	*possibly* because of the audit stuff, not sure
<jackwinter_>	grawity: i know, am trying to understand why :)
<mrelendig>	jackwinter_: namespace support is in the kernel, audit is not because of the big downsides
<jackwinter_>	mrelendig: ok, gonna look at that too
<jackwinter_>	mrelendig: i know that namespace is in the kernel, but seem to remember that we had to remove audit support because of namespace/systemd?  or were there other downsides to audit?
<mrelendig>	jackwinter_: it was not due to systemd
<mrelendig>	it is due to performance issues etc
<jackwinter_>	i thought it was due to namespace not working well with it.  ok then i have to google even more then :)
<mrelendig>	jackwinter_: https://www.redhat.com/archives/linux-audit/2015-january/msg00171.html
<phrik>	title: linux audit performance impact (at www.redhat.com)
<mrelendig>	jackwinter_: there was some issues with audit and namespaces too
<mrelendig>	but the main complaint was performance iirc
<jackwinter_>	mrelendig: does grsec/pax run well on the distro kernel?  really my biggest concern is not having to maintain yet another kernel :)
<mrelendig>	jackwinter_: grs/pax is out of kernel
<mrelendig>	there is a patched kenrel in community
<jackwinter_>	so i need a non distro kernel for it too?
<mrelendig>	biggest "problem" is that arch doesn't really provide any ready to use profiles for the mac
<mrelendig>	jackwinter_: arch maintains a patched kernel in community
<mrelendig>	jackwinter_: so you don't have to build it yourself
<jackwinter_>	mrelendig: yeah but i use the realtime patch all the time, so i'll have to build a kernel for that too.  was hoping that there was some kind of lsm that i could run on the distro kernel...
<killermoehre>	jackwinter_: every lsm i know needs direct kernel support
<jackwinter_>	because the rt kernels i build essentially use the distro kernel config with just a few changes.  so if i want lsm i'll have to build rt kernels for aur/archaudio and then another one for myself with lsm and rt (+nvidia, etc :s)
<tylerdurden01>	what do you guys think of installing mesa-i915g instead of just mesa? will it give me a performance increase?
<mrelendig>	if you are building your own kernel anyway, just add grs/pax support to it?
<mrelendig>	tylerdurden01: try it and see
<jackwinter_>	killermoehre: well i was hoping there was something that would work with the distro kernel.  ok looks like a lot of googling coming up then :)
<tylerdurden01>	mrelendig: ...
<mrelendig>	tylerdurden01: probably better off using mesa-git if you want performance though
<mrelendig>	tylerdurden01: actually testing yourself is the only way to find out if it will give you any noticable performance increase on your system
<mrelendig>	!common-sense
<phrik>	http://arch.har-ikkje.net/gfx/common-sense.jpg
<jackwinter_>	mrelendig: well i'd like to reduce the amount of kernels i have to build.  it's not like i don't have better things to do than building/testing kernels...  :)
<mrelendig>	get more boxes instead of switching the kernel all the time
<mrelendig>	:p
<jackwinter_>	i'd prefer not adding stuff to the rt kernels that aren't really in the distro kernel
<nostrora>	hello, why yaourt ask me everytime "continue installing .. ?[y/n]" ? i always want y
<jackwinter_>	so to sum it up, there is no lsm support of any kind in the distro kernel for performance reasons?  both apparmour and grsec will work with systemd but will need special kernels?
<mrelendig>	nostrora: read the manual
<mrelendig>	nostrora: and/or hack the source
<jackwinter_>	or get rid of yaourt :)
<killermoehre>	jackwinter_: yes
<nostrora>	jackwinter_: what is "rid" ?
<jackwinter_>	nostrora: don't use yaourt, develop another workflow :)
<mrelendig>	nostrora: you know that you can just press enter btw?
<cn>	has anyone gotten really, really small fonts with the qt4 update?
<mrelendig>	nostrora: enter will select whatever is capitalized
<d_garbage>	slightly complicated reasons, yaourt kind of causes problems not directly due to what it is but how people use it
<mrelendig>	nostrora: in any sanely written app
<mrelendig>	cn: no, specially not you
<cn>	oh, ok
<cn>	i thought it was just my imagination
<cn>	turns out it was!
<nostrora>	ok thanks ;)
<jackwinter_>	cn: you have a nvidia?
<mrelendig>	cn: because if you had, you would know that someone, namely you, have that issue, and therefor you would not have to ask if anyone have it
<cn>	nope
<d_garbage>	cower + makepkg will do pretty much the same thing but gives you more direct control of things
<mrelendig>	cn: just change the font size?
<d_garbage>	!shrug2
<phrik>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<jackwinter_>	d_garbage: is somewhat of a pain when a package wants 5 other aur packages, etc.  but that's what i use (or devtools)
<cn>	mrelendig: i did, but it's weird that i needed 18pt font size for it to be the same size as ~9pt
<cn>	perhaps it's something else..
<d_garbage>	yes, that's why i don't use packages that have 5 aur deps
<jushur>	cn: you on a hdpi screen?
<tylerdurden01>	d_garbage: why not?
<tylerdurden01>	d_garbage: you're going to refuse software on principle?
<d_garbage>	because it's not a good sign, imo
<tylerdurden01>	you guys are more mental than i am
<jackwinter_>	tylerdurden01: yaourt/aur is a long discussion, but there are some reasons that some of us don't like it :)
<jackwinter_>	but we are probably all quite mental :)
<d_garbage>	it causes problems when it prevents people from understanding the build/packaging system, otherwise i wouldn't give two hoots about it
<thelemonman>	cool, i somehow managed to drain (again) the battery to exactly 0%, must set up some way to notify that
<d_garbage>	it's all about that sinking feeling you get when someone says, "i installed this packaged from yaourt"
<d_garbage>	it's the packaging equivalent of people typing web addresses into google
<jackwinter_>	still without the aur (with it's blemishes) we'd be pretty fucked for some software..
<d_garbage>	you'd write your own packages, perhaps it would be better
<tylerdurden01>	d_garbage: neeeeeeerd
<jackwinter_>	reinventing the wheel and possibly making mistakes.  sometimes it can take a while and lots of googling to write a good buildscript
<d_garbage>	and learn in the process
<d_garbage>	and become independent
<jackwinter_>	sure, but not everyone uses archlinux to learn, some just want to use it because it's quite a good and up to date distro
<d_garbage>	or use something else
<jackwinter_>	but all a long discussion that we've all had on many occasions :)
<d_garbage>	!shrug
<phrik>	¯\(º_o)/¯
<d_garbage>	personally i think that arch is a lot about learning, it's one of the things its design specifically allows even encourages you to do
<jackwinter_>	personally i don't think it's realistic to expect users to create their own packages for everything that isn't in the main repos
<d_garbage>	yeah but who cares about users?
<jackwinter_>	right :)
<d_garbage>	they can look after themselves
<tazmain>	lol without users what is arch then ?
<d_garbage>	better
<tazmain>	lol :p
<mrelendig>	tazmain: better
<mrelendig>	fucking lag
<tazmain>	so what arch will then only be used by the arch devs then
<namarrgon>	that's what it was at some point
<d_garbage>	how it was originally
<jackwinter_>	if so, why don't we just close the aur? :)
<d_garbage>	i have no idea
<d_garbage>	respect for people's work/investment i guess
<d_garbage>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/official_repositories#historical_background
<phrik>	title: official repositories - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<d_garbage>	the aur is a fine idea, provided people remember what it actually is
<jackwinter_>	possibly one could consider a group vetting aur buildscripts/contributors and make a build farm for "approved" scripts.  like that people could mostly stop using aur and get most aur packages from a binary repo
<d_garbage>	you want to organise that then?
<jackwinter_>	but i guess that's what the tus essentially are
<d_garbage>	no, not really
<tazmain>	jackwinter_, that would be great. expect for the things that you need to recompile when you change a kernel
<jackwinter_>	d_garbage: not really :)  and i don't think i have the time for it either
<d_garbage>	you're thinking of [community]
<d_garbage>	read the link above
<sakuj0>	o_/ reading up on all the kvm+qemu+libvirt docs. my goal is to set up a guest on a dedicated server with a dedicated, static and exposed ipv4 address, where the host *only* ever has vpn connectivity. i will not ever install more than 1 guest, i only want it to be exposed via vpn and speak with the host internally (mount 1 of its lv pretty much).
<sakuj0>	i am unsure whether i need bridged networking set up or not
<sakuj0>	in my naive picture it seemd great to "bridge" the guest to the tun on the host's openvpn connection
<sakuj0>	that way i would not have to mess around with iptables on the guest maybe?
<sakuj0>	oh shoot
<sakuj0>	s/ where the host *only* ever has vpn connectivity/ where the guest *only* ever has vpn connectivity
<jackwinter_>	d_garbage: yeah, tus build binaries for community instead of them being in the aur.  don't see what i said that is different?
<jackwinter_>	except i guess there is also that rule that a package has to have a certain amount of votes to be allowed to be promoted to community
<shadowkatstudios>	anyone got any idea how i would compile java for the hp chaivm?
<trivia_man>	i need help with setting up the shared folder, i'm stuck on what i should be doing at that point
<sakuj0>	hmm i guess i have not tried to google my idea (bridging the tun for the guest)
<zum0>	hi, im running antergos / openbox just noticed that that my usb is mounted under /media in sted of /run/media ??
<jackwinter_>	sakuj0: i'd imagine that even if you bridge your virtual interfaces you'd still like to have a firewall protecting the virtual system
<cn>	jushur: i'm not on a hidpi screen, i'm not quite sure when this started occurring though
<sakuj0>	that would be a firewall on the host i suppose
<jackwinter_>	but i suppose you might be able to firewall the bridge on the host system, probably depends on your needs
<sakuj0>	so far i have been relying on my router, this is the first dedicated server i grabbed
<sakuj0>	i will be able to block pretty much all ports i guess except for the ones i forward
<d_garbage>	jackwinter_, everything
<sakuj0>	but that would be the next step. looking even forward a bit to reading all the iptables docs and firewall documentation
<jackwinter_>	sakuj0: i would not depend on a router to protect you...  many of them are hopelessly insecure :s
<d_garbage>	jackwinter_, [community] is already a 'satellite' of arch the aur is a satellite of a satellite
<d_garbage>	a rock orbiting a moon :)
<jackwinter_>	d_garbage: i think we agree on it :)
<sakuj0>	so a home router with a home laptop is insecure as i rely on the porter not to expose all the ports?
<sakuj0>	so i want to even set up the firewall on my laptop that runs arch linux i guess
<sakuj0>	s/porter/router (lol)
<jackwinter_>	sakuj0: if someone compromises your router you are completely defenceless without some kind of firewall/lsm on your hosts
<d_garbage>	but people are greedy and want to believe that the aur is part of arch so they can imagine that all that extra stuff is supported
<sakuj0>	ic
<sakuj0>	i will look into that tonight then. i mean copromsing the router seems nigh impossible as i instantly get alerted as soon as an unknown host enters my network (i had troubles with a neighbour that somehow got into my network once)
<sakuj0>	but yeah, at least for the home nas
<sakuj0>	even if it has no sensitive information
<d_garbage>	which brings us full circle as to why things like yaourt can be so annoying because for people new to arch they blur the lines
<jackwinter_>	sakuj0: see this for instance: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/08/13/fifteen_zero_days_found_in_hacker_router_romp/
<phrik>	title: fifteen zero days found in hacker router comp romp • the register (at www.theregister.co.uk)
<sakuj0>	darn
<sakuj0>	and now consider all the things you and me do not know, but some fat kid in some irc channel on an obscure network
<shadowkatstudios>	you guys would be amazed how insecure some people leave printers capible of running arbitrary code.
<d_garbage>	why 'fat' and why 'kid', that's rather insulting
<d_garbage>	you resent people who have knowledge, who maybe made an effort to learn what they know?
<sakuj0>	d_garbage, i try not to discriminate, of course slim kids and fat grown-ups can do that too. but i would like to think even overweight children can know about exploits
<jackwinter_>	sakuj0: i think even if you have no sensitive information, it probably makes sense trying to protect yourself.  personally i think if an org like the nsa and friends want to pop you, you can forget defending yourself, but at the very least you can try to protect yourself against script kiddies and normal run of the mill blackhat scum...
<sakuj0>	d_garbage, but my apologies for the language. i did not think anyone would take offense as it was an obvious stereotype and not referring to any network/individual/type of person
<sakuj0>	jackwinter_, yep, only thing i am worried about.
<sakuj0>	some people are truly unreasonable out there
<d_garbage>	i've seen so often people demanding to be spoon fed out of some weird sense of entitlement and pouring out all kinds of spite and hate when they don't get their free handout. it becomes quite sad when you see it often enough
<homerj>	i poured out all kinds of sprite
<homerj>	it was flat
<d_garbage>	hahaha
<d_garbage>	<£
<shadowkatstudios>	weeeird, this machine has more ramdisk than storage
<bogdanteleaga>	is anyone here using python-themer-git?
<sakuj0>	it is a bit weird, though d_garbage . i use the stereotype of the "fat kid with a staellite dish" or "script kiddie" for exactly those people that sadden you
<jackwinter_>	sakuj0: so close all your hosts with a firewall to start off with, then just open the ports you need, or use an openvpn/ssh for everything on your lan
<d_garbage>	no, i feel it's quite the opposite
<tylerdurden01>	anyone have any idea what might be causing this graphical glitch? http://i.imgur.com/digbzhj.png
<homerj>	i want a satellite dish
<tylerdurden01>	integrated intel gpu
<homerj>	one of those 10' varieties
<homerj>	i remember my friend had one in the 80s, watch sporting events without commercials
<homerj>	you just got the feed they beamed to the local stations
<d_garbage>	satellite was pretty sexy when it first came out
<tylerdurden01>	homerj: ingenious lol
<homerj>	that's all encrypted for the most part now
<jackwinter_>	homerj: there are ways around that too :)
<homerj>	tylerdurden01, well, where i grew up, there wasn't cable
<homerj>	things like directv didn't exist
<xyh>	what happened to github today ??
<homerj>	d_garbage, all the stuff that was on there
<jackwinter_>	i also remember dxing with the sat dish many years ago.  was fun times.
<d_garbage>	homerj, well, just the technology really
<homerj>	you got tv from around the world
<earnestly>	longwave radio
<homerj>	took a while to realign the dish to the sat. you wanted
<earnestly>	nice thing about analog, even if the signal is weak you get something while with digital it's pretty close to all or nothing
<jackwinter_>	once i even caught the vatican tv on uhf in sweden for 10-15minutes.
<d_garbage>	i'm the perhaps slightly strange kind of person who still feels a certain sense of wonder when i watch passenger jets fly by
<homerj>	earnestly, unless you get that digital signal that's all herp a derp derp
<jackwinter_>	or possibly vhf, don't remember anymore
<homerj>	analog is just a little fuzzy
<d_garbage>	perhaps i'm just old
<homerj>	i was 13 before i watched a clear abc
<homerj>	mother wasn't going to pay the cash to get a dish, and didn't watch a lot of tv
<earnestly>	xyh: https://status.github.com/
<phrik>	title: github system status (at status.github.com)
<earnestly>	oh, he's gone
<tylerdurden01>	homerj: thank god that you were spared of growing up on tv
<earnestly>	but yeah, github just died a few minutes ago
<homerj>	tylerdurden01, well, did have nbc, pbs, a fuzzy cbs and abc
<homerj>	baseball games were radio only
<rena>	earnestly: wow, exception percentage is well over 100% on the graph
<earnestly>	tylerdurden01: old tv stations weren't as bad, and besides, you often couldn't patch 24/7 anyway.  you'd just get a calibration picture while the station was off air
<earnestly>	patch/watch
<sakuj0>	i guess i can just add the tun device to the virbr0
<earnestly>	waiting for morning cartoons to come on, heh
<homerj>	yeah, those days when tv stations went off the air
<homerj>	got the national anthem
<homerj>	then the color bars
<earnestly>	homerj: bbc4 still does that here
<rena>	huge antenna next to the house with a motor to turn it
<rena>	picked up 5 channels, maybe 6 on a good day
<homerj>	when we finally moved, the first thing we did was get cable
<tylerdurden01>	i thought that you guys in the west had pretty much 24/7 tv lots of decades ago :o
<homerj>	i still miss the old slider box
<homerj>	if you did it just right, you sometimes could get free hbo
<earnestly>	rena: "mean web response time" spiked to 500ms and then dead.  also i find that copy-pasting uppercase letters, not being uppercase in the destination, to be another disturbing thing about the "web".
<earnestly>	i.e. https://thejh.net/misc/website-terminal-copy-paste
<phrik>	title: copy-paste from website to terminal (at thejh.net)
<homerj>	watched many a wrestlemania on another friend's cheater box
<earnestly>	so, ponylang.  is actually kind of a serious deal.
<homerj>	that still kind of works for directv, kind of a cat & mouse game with it from the company
<earnestly>	i wonder if they'll rename
<homerj>	they generally change it up right before a big ppv event
<earnestly>	hopefully my suggestion to get nicer linux/unix integration gets in
<earnestly>	"sorry, we're down for maintenance" lol
<wasamasa>	earnestly: ponies are serious business
<wasamasa>	!give earnestly ponies
<phrik>	earnestly: http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/12/11/450
<homerj>	that's one of those groups of people i didn't think existed until i saw them
<earnestly>	wasamasa: the only slightly annoying thing apart from no documentation yet, is that they don't allow top-level functions.  i kind of get that
<homerj>	like a furry
<wasamasa>	earnestly: wait, what?
<earnestly>	wasamasa: all functions have to be part of a type
<homerj>	i remember i went out for lunch once and saw a guy walking around on all fours on a leash
<earnestly>	wasamasa: or primative
<wasamasa>	homerj: hawt
<homerj>	i was like r. lee emory in full metal jacket
<homerj>	holy jesus what is that
<earnestly>	wasamasa: http://sprunge.us/oqcy?pony
<d_garbage>	homerj, people are people
<homerj>	pittsburgh has the national furry convention or something now
<earnestly>	d_garbage: some people are dogs
<d_garbage>	!sting
<phrik>	ba-dum *ching*
<earnestly>	wasamasa: i kind of find it funny that they not only have 'this' but also 'that'
<homerj>	d_garbage, yeah, but sometimes you need a heads up
<earnestly>	wasamasa: (size() < that.size()) and (this <= that)
<d_garbage>	actually that whole owners/dogs thing seems so true, i've often wondered why
<earnestly>	wasamasa: also, they don't do arithmatic precendence, which is yay
<earnestly>	wasamasa: so you just use parens
<homerj>	d_garbage, like when i worked in a grocery store, i was stacking something and this lady asked me where something was, i turned around and where an eye would be, she had this plastic thing with a drawn in eye that looked like a 5 year old did it because i guess she couldn't afford a glass eye
<earnestly>	i wonder if they'll change that
<homerj>	i went "i think it's in ai...ahhh"
<homerj>	"aisle 5"
<d_garbage>	homerj, wow, that's sad
<homerj>	i felt bad
<homerj>	not expecting that
<d_garbage>	homerj, perhaps the best way is to be honest
<d_garbage>	although as an employee in a service job, the rules are slightly different of course
<d_garbage>	but in life generally
<earnestly>	11:40 utc "we're doing emergency maintenance to recover the site."
<sbrg>	anyone here using linux-ck that can tell me if they downgraded back to 3.19.x from 4.0.0.1? pacaur is telling me mine is newer than their current... which is where i got mine
<ranzpirat>	sbrg: you can always check yourself? https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-ck/
<phrik>	title: aur (en) - linux-ck (at aur.archlinux.org)
<sbrg>	ranzpirat: oh, didn't think of that
<earnestly>	sbrg: see the support thread and aur comments where linux-ck is supported
<earnestly>	wasamasa: "if this isnt that then" lol
<d_garbage>	homerj, i once complimented a lady on her interesting and exotically attractve makeup design, it turned out it was a scar. it made her so happy i'll always remember that :)
<earnestly>	wasamasa: http://ix.io/ijf
<ranzpirat>	sbrg: from a quick glance over the commentsection, you should stick with 3.19 for the moment. unexplained kernel-panics are never a good thing.
<sbrg>	ranzpirat: yeah
<sbrg>	that's what's been happening
<sbrg>	should probably downgrade
<wasamasa>	earnestly: try that head
<earnestly>	wasamasa: :p
<earnestly>	wasamasa: and it is actually a proper capabilities-security language
<earnestly>	wasamasa: inspired by e
<earnestly>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/e_(programming_language)
<homerj>	eventually we're going to run out of single letters for refer to programming languages and software

<wasamasa>	earnestly: hmm
<nimpsnawak>	hi !
<namarrgon>	hello
<nimpsnawak>	i've a big issue with my laptop running classic install of arch x86_64 with xfce, up to date
<d_garbage>	'classic'?
<nimpsnawak>	since a little while, my desktop just freeze when i'am using my touchpad to scroll up or down, mostyly on firefox
<nimpsnawak>	d_garbage, standard, without weird conf
<d_garbage>	?
<nimpsnawak>	the fact is i'm force to hard shutdown (power key) my laptop and i don't know what to look for
<d_garbage>	nimpsnawak, sysrq
<nimpsnawak>	i don't use syslog anymore, only journactl
<d_garbage>	it's very rare that you need to hard reset, look into sysrq
<nimpsnawak>	d_garbage, crtl-alt-del doesn't work
<metredigm>	sysrq + r e i s u b
<nimpsnawak>	metredigm, ??
<d_garbage>	nimpsnawak, if you don't know what sysrq is, look it up. you will find it very useful
<wasamasa>	earnestly: how about we both engage in making a lisp
<nimpsnawak>	i ddgling it now
<wasamasa>	earnestly: https://github.com/kanaka/mal/blob/master/process/guide.md
<phrik>	title: mal/guide.md at master · kanaka/mal · github (at github.com)
<jelle>	more lisps ...
<wasamasa>	earnestly: you on pony, me on elisp
<wasamasa>	jelle: just implementations of that document
<jelle>	wasamasa: this is quiet nice
<d_garbage>	nimpsnawak, it's a sytem of passing commands directly to the kernel, such that nothing short of a kernel crash will make you lose control of your system
<wasamasa>	earnestly: it seems to have all the prerequisites fulfilled, so it's not going to be as involved as on c
<d_garbage>	system*
<nimpsnawak>	d_garbage, i used it once in order to force umout/reboot but i don't know nothing more
<wasamasa>	jelle: yeah, the document makes for a nice balance between making it possible and learning a lot while doing it
<d_garbage>	nimpsnawak, look it up, it's a very usefull thing to know
<jelle>	wasamasa: yeah
<earnestly>	wasamasa: oh, this is just an interesting new language.  i just collect all-the-languages
<wasamasa>	gotta catch 'em all
<nimpsnawak>	sysrq + r e i s u b
<nimpsnawak>	what i'm supposed to do with that ?
<earnestly>	that's right.  i was trying to install cm3 modula-3 but... i may not, it looks almost unpackagable
<d_garbage>	!give nimpsnawak sysrq
<phrik>	nimpsnawak: send commands directly to the kernel: https://www.kernel.org/doc/documentation/sysrq.txt
<nimpsnawak>	based on fedora wiki, i've just enabled it
<d_garbage>	nimpsnawak, they are codes
<nimpsnawak>	ok
<wasamasa>	"earnest collected all 50 archipelago badges!"
<d_garbage>	nimpsnawak, each letter combination represents a differnent function. commands you can pass directly to the kerenel
<metredigm>	nimpsnawak: will safely reset the system (safely as in not destroy your drives, in-ram data will be lost though)
<nimpsnawak>	d_garbage, seeing that
<metredigm>	nimpsnawak: aka, "busier" backwards
<nimpsnawak>	ok ok
<tylerdurden01>	will compiling the kernel with -march=native give me a noticeable performance increase?
<d_garbage>	nimpsnawak, it allows you, amongst other things, to close down the system gracefully so not losing data or causing damage when otherwise you might be hitting the 'off' button
<nimpsnawak>	so i need to run  echo "letter" > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
<nimpsnawak>	for each letter ?
<d_garbage>	nimpsnawak, or you can use the keyboard combination, using the 'sysrq' key
<nimpsnawak>	but how can i see what went wrong ?
<d_garbage>	nimpsnawak, usially also the 'print screen' key
<d_garbage>	usually*
<metredigm>	alt-sysrq (while holding down, press reisub)
<nimpsnawak>	like in the logs or something
<d_garbage>	nimpsnawak, well there is the system journal for starters
<nimpsnawak>	d_garbage, is there a easy way to grep just before the shutdown ?
<d_garbage>	nimpsnawak, not sure what you are trying to do
<nimpsnawak>	to see if xorg crashes (or something else) before i press the power key
<d_garbage>	?
<aphirst>	i'm having a problem regarding "create volatile files and directories" on startup which looks like the one mentioned on the systemd archwiki page, but i've already enabled acl for my /var partition in fstab
<d_garbage>	nimpsnawak, i kind of feel you need to back up a few steps and explain the problem again
<nimpsnawak>	something, i don't know what, make my pc freeze, i would like to see in the logs what is the event/process who does that
<namarrgon>	can you still ssh in after it freezes?
<d_garbage>	nimpsnawak, the journal has persistent logging (by default) allowing you to examine logs of previous boots. xorg keep a  log of the last boot, iirc
<nimpsnawak>	namarrgon, ssh is not enabled
<d_garbage>	nimpsnawak, i really think you are missing something in exaplianing your problem
<d_garbage>	explaining*
<nimpsnawak>	d_garbage, while i'm doing stuff on my pc, the desktop/interface just freeze : no mouse control nor keyboard, i just can't do anything except hard shutdown
<d_garbage>	ok
<earnestly>	vodik: perhaps you might consider using prefix as well as destdir in your makefiles where prefix is ?= /usr/local
<d_garbage>	that's usually a hardware related problem, liek video drivers or such
<d_garbage>	like*
<d_garbage>	often hard to diagnose
<nimpsnawak>	d_garbage, ok
<d_garbage>	nimpsnawak, when did this problem start happening?
<nimpsnawak>	a week ago, something like that but it may not be related to recent update (nothing found about that on the forum)
<d_garbage>	well the kernel was updated recently
<d_garbage>	that can be a biggie
<nimpsnawak>	i've recently added "options i915 enable_rc6=1 enable_fbc=1 lvds_downclock=1" to /etc/modprobe.d/i915.conf
<nimpsnawak>	might be related ??
<d_garbage>	dunno, maybe
<d_garbage>	try reversing that?
<tylerdurden01>	the heck?! mesa allows me only opengl version 1.4!?
<nimpsnawak>	yeah, i just thank about that so, i've remoed it and i will see
<nimpsnawak>	thank you guys anyway
<d_garbage>	nimpsnawak, i don't know much. mostly i try to get people to describe the problem in a way which might cause others to take interest
<d_garbage>	nimpsnawak, if that doesn't work then start having a look at logs, and maybe sprunging them for people to look at
<nimpsnawak>	d_garbage, i understand, thx anyway for your time, i will
<tylerdurden01>	on an older laptop, i remember that intel gpus performed better. has there been a change in the intel gpus packages or something lately?
<d_garbage>	freezes are so hard to deal with usually
<trolleader>	tylerdurden01: you should get mesa 3.0
<trolleader>	*opengl
<tylerdurden01>	trolleader: how can i do that?
<arthar360>	hi..i am working with squid, i have set reply_body_max_size 5 mb and it is blocking the downloads larger then 5 mb. but i tried downloading a file of 6 mb from www.bankofindia.co.in , it is getting downloaded. there is nothing in the logs. only the file from bankofindia.co.in gets downloaded even if it is greater then 5 mb. all others (files > 5mb from other sites) are blocked. any known reason ?
<trolleader>	tylerdurden01: no idea. (lib32-)mesa-libgl should be enough
<tylerdurden01>	...
<d_garbage>	i think i switched from opensuse to mandriva long ago because of random freezes. looking back it was probably a kernel issue but i didn't know about such things back then
<earnestly>	lots of cool makefile related things: http://make.mad-scientist.net/2014/11/
<phrik>	title: november | 2014 | gnu make (at make.mad-scientist.net)
<trolleader>	tylerdurden01: did you actually see glsl 1.4
<tylerdurden01>	trolleader: oh wait, i saw that :d
<tylerdurden01>	sorry
<trolleader>	it should be opengl 3.1 then
<trolleader>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opengl_shading_language#versions
<trolleader>	phrik: hey
<trolleader>	october 8, 2012 mesa 9.0 is released. this is the first version of mesa to support opengl 3.1 and glsl 1.40 (with the i965 driver). see the release notes for more information about the release.
<d_garbage>	!phrik
<phrik>	forever broken, but i'm still not your butler.
<tylerdurden01>	trolleader: this is what glxinfo gives me http://sprunge.us/hmnn
<trolleader>	seems fine
<trolleader>	glx is 1.4 as well btw
<trolleader>	hmm why there are no extensions show in your output? is that normal for mesa?
<tylerdurden01>	trolleader: i gave you what i grepped glxinfo for opengl
<namarrgon>	#archlinux — rule №47: don't filter output unless instructed to do so.
<trolleader>	!errormsg
<sd1001>	huh, it puts the number inside № here
<sd1001>	no, the o thingy is just cut off always
<earnestly>	sd1001: because it's a wide character
<earnestly>	sd1001: and terminals are cell-based
<sheldor_the_conq>	hi, since  gnupg version 2.1.3-3, i can't decrypt emails, can you fix it ?
<d_garbage>	no
<earnestly>	[][][][][] []№[][][][]
<d_garbage>	but maybe you can
<earnestly>	№ 47 fix it like this
<earnestly>	or just use #
<d_garbage>	sheldor_the_conq, how does it fail?
<d_garbage>	sheldor_the_conq, give people something to look at/go on
<trolleader>	hmm so "opengl core profile version string" is the hardware version?
<tylerdurden01>	trolleader: probably
<trolleader>	i got 4.4 for that with my 750ti, and 4.5 for opengl version string
<trolleader>	hmm http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20779242/core-profile-vs-version-string-only-getting-glsl-1-3-ogl-3-0-in-mesa-10-0-1
<trolleader>	bay trail should support gl4 though
<tylerdurden01>	trolleader: that might be true when using windows

<tigrmesh>	i find it hard to use.  if you wait, someone who's good with it should come along
<terajl>	tigrmesh: do you have a better alternative? and the problem is about dirmngr i think and not exactly gpg
<tigrmesh>	i know very little about it, sorry

<tigrmesh>	hello rayiner
<sudokode>	hump daaaaaayyyyyyy
<rayiner>	i don't often go there, what's going on?
<namarrgon>	just the regular madness
<rayiner>	haha, good to know
<holomorph>	we're all mad
<rayiner>	am i?
<rayiner>	maybe.
<namarrgon>	no normal person would join #archlinux
<sudokode>	are you answering your own questions?
<sudokode>	yes
<rayiner>	usually.
<terajl>	tigrmesh: i tried to rename the folder, tried to add an empty config, and running dirmngr < /dev/null and nothing worked
<rayiner>	so, speaking of arch, yesterday i've made a fresh install, like 5th time this month.
<cirrus_minor>	i've been mad for fkn years, absoloutely years, like most of us are
<sudokode>	rayiner: the definition of insanity
<rayiner>	am i the only one?
<rayiner>	i hope not
<sudokode>	on the same system?
<sudokode>	yes
<sudokode>	you're the only one
<muchweb>	namarrgon: define normal
<rayiner>	shit
<saivert>	abnormal
<rayiner>	so then, i did not do you then
<sudokode>	uhhh
<sudokode>	could you rephrase that
<rayiner>	what the fuck am i saying
<sudokode>	i don't knowwww
<sudokode>	but i have a banana
<rayiner>	basically, http://nautil.us/issue/23/dominoes/yes-you-can-catch-insanity
<phrik>	title: yes, you can catch insanity: reviving the debate about the immune system and mental illness. (at nautil.us)
<saivert>	so you can pass insanity onto others?
<rayiner>	how would you define insanity?

<earnestly>	wasamasa: there's a vim syntax file now
<namarrgon>	terajl: what command are you running and what's the exact output?
<mar77i>	derp. hi
<vfw>	what can we do with .rpm or .deb ?
<vfw>	( http://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadtop.aspx?c=us&lang=en&prod=hl5170dn_all )
<phrik>	title: downloads | hl-5170dn | united states | brother (at support.brother.com)
<vfw>	do we have a rpm converter of some sort?
<john_f>	bsdtar?
<john_f>	or look at the other 100 brother aur packages
<trolleader>	ar for deb
<vfw>	john_f: trolleader was that for me?
<trolleader>	yes
<vfw>	can you elaborate just a bit?
<user123abc>	tcl's builtin commands have the same names as various posix functions, and e.g. `man open` tells me about tcl's command. which isn't what i want, ever. what's the best way to get stop these pages from popping up?
<trolleader>	makepkg extract deb with ar automagically
<trolleader>	not sure about rpm, but we have rpmextract anyway
<user123abc>	i can't uninstall tcl.
<jelle>	sure you can
<user123abc>	is there a way to exclude certain man files from lookup, or to change lookup rules?
<earnestly>	why?...
<sudokode>	wtf are you doin
<user123abc>	me?
<earnestly>	user123abc: you've heard about manual sections, right?
<sudokode>	user123abc: learn how to use man
<earnestly>	which open do you want?
<yuvadm>	is there any example that shows a systemd service that starts upon creation of a tty device? /dev/ttyusb0, for example.
<user123abc>	yeah, and i don't want to keep doing "man open" "oops it's not what i want" "man 2 open"
<user123abc>	it's very annoying
<vfw>	trying to get brother hl-5170dm printer configured.
<yuvadm>	i need a service that runs on startup, but that won't fail due to /dev/ttyusb0 not existing
<earnestly>	user123abc: noextract= in pacman.conf
<sudokode>	user123abc: the posix man page actually overrides man 2 open
<devgrohl>	some recommendation for a local email server?
<sudokode>	so it's not as if this isn't already happening without tcl
<earnestly>	but i wouldn't recommend it
<earnestly>	just think before you spam commands
<sudokode>	vim -a open
<terajl>	namarrgon: "gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --send-keys 1fe132ea" and i get "gpg: keyserver send failed: no keyserver available" with "--debug-all" i get "err 167772346 no keyserver available <dirmngr>"
<microcolonel>	hmm
<hyo0301>	so scary dude
<sudokode>	me?
<microcolonel>	maybe the nodejs package should set npm's "python" variable to "python2" by default
<godginrai>	user123abc: just tell man what section you are looking in
<wasamasa>	microcolonel: npm should arrive in 2015
<hyo0301>	sudokode: no, installing arch without deleting  your c files
<d_garbage>	hyo0301, ahh, how's the arch install going then?
<wasamasa>	microcolonel: all distros in use can deal with python2 now
<hyo0301>	i'm going nowhere, just reading wiki d_garbage
<d_garbage>	hyo0301, got your vim installed now? :)
<hyo0301>	that was on vm
<user123abc>	the point is i want to have a more useful default heuristic than "shadow all of posix with tcl builtin commands"
<user123abc>	but the noextract suggestion is good
<hyo0301>	i'm doing the real thing and making a dualboot with my win7 now
<d_garbage>	hyo0301, ahh, time for the bare metal challenge then?
<hyo0301>	yup
<hyo0301>	going to fail so hard
<d_garbage>	gpt/uefi?
<hyo0301>	what?
<cirrus_minor>	:/
<hyo0301>	no i just literally came home with a new usb
<hyo0301>	i just put .iso file in there, and now i'm trying to figure out what to do
<d_garbage>	it's funny, half the time it sounds like you know what you're doing and the other half you sound clueless :)
<godginrai>	hyo0301: he was asking if you were going to use gpt with uefi  for the dual boot
<sudokode>	you should probably have some kind of plan for this...
<hyo0301>	i'm just bad at the installing, i can do everything else such as installing packages, ricing and other sht easy
<sudokode>	maybe with a contingency or two
<godginrai>	^ indeed
<sudokode>	installing is probably the most important part of using arch
<cirrus_minor>	hyo0301:  may i ask how you put the .iso onto the usb stick ?
<d_garbage>	hyo0301, ah right. well, at least with arch you only have to install once :)
<timofonic>	hello
<hyo0301>	godginrai:  i don't even know how to get uefi or gpt lmao
<sudokode>	h
<sudokode>	i
<d_garbage>	timofonic, saying hello on irc is pointless and redundant. what do you want?
<hyo0301>	cirrus_minor: i just dragged my .iso file to the f:
<sudokode>	hyo0301: if you're not gonna read, we're not gonna help you when you have issues
<timofonic>	are there some way to always get the fastest mirrors or do some kind of segmented downloading? i get mad at downloading them at 400-500 kb/s
<hyo0301>	sudokode: sorry  just read whatever highlights me...
<timofonic>	d_garbage: i just try to be polite, it's something i'm used to
<sudokode>	!give hyo0301 beginners
<godginrai>	hyo0301: well, before you start your install, make sure you know the difference between gpt and mbr and which of the two you will be using.  as well as what uefi is and whether your computer supports it (and if you plan to use it)
<phrik>	hyo0301: read this! all of it, twice! your answer is probably here! http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/beginners%27_guide
<cirrus_minor>	ok ty hyo0301 i thought as much
<sudokode>	yay cookout today
<sudokode>	hopefully the weather holds up
<d_garbage>	timofonic, you can optimise mirrors with the web page or with reflector, you can do simultaneous downloads with aria
<timofonic>	even better! are there a way to automatize segmented downloading? any progress on using p2p/torrent for it? what about metalinks?
<sudokode>	segmented downloading?
<timofonic>	d_garbage: yes. but what is the most feasible method? i currently use apacman
<d_garbage>	timofonic, irc etiquette is different, 'hello' is generally pointless
<timofonic>	sudokode: yes, downloading different parts of a same file from different servers
<hyo0301>	godginrai: i know mbr, but not uefi
<d_garbage>	usually indicates people who don't use irc much
<sudokode>	what's the point in that?
<sudokode>	just get faster internet
<timofonic>	d_garbage: i was an irc nerd, it seems i forgot most of it :d
<wasamasa>	d_garbage: hello
<d_garbage>	timofonic, so it would seem
<d_garbage>	wasamasa, you are pointless :p
<wasamasa>	d_garbage: oh noes
<d_garbage>	}:]
<sudokode>	100% bandwidth <-> server 1   vs   50% bandwidth <-> server 1 + 50% bandwidth <-> server 2
<wasamasa>	no idea what that means though
<vfw>	how can i get a brother_hl-5170dn_series configured on arch linux?
<sudokode>	not to mention the communication between the two processes building the file
<sudokode>	since downloading the same segment twice is pointless
<wasamasa>	vfw: same way as on any other unix-like
<wasamasa>	vfw: pay a sacrifice to cups
<d_garbage>	timofonic, i already said, 'aria'
<timofonic>	sudokode: of course. many download managers do that, like aria
<wasamasa>	vfw: and pray for it to listen to your puny request
<sudokode>	yeah but it's only effective in certain scenarios
<d_garbage>	what's the hurry anyway?
<timofonic>	d_garbage: i know. do i need to use another kind of wrapper? i like pacman, but this wrapper madness is messy to me!
<d_garbage>	timofonic, pacman,conf
<d_garbage>	.
<d_garbage>	man
<saivert>	assuming you get 100% bandwidth from server #1

<phrik>	title: downloads | hl-5170dn | united states | brother (at support.brother.com)
<sudokode>	saivert: yes, it depends on the scenario
<timofonic>	d_garbage: the hurry is not using my bw and waiting for big updates, as these days i have little time to manage my computer :)
<timofonic>	d_garbage: ok
<wasamasa>	!give vfw wiki cups
<phrik>	vfw: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/cups
<timofonic>	d_garbage: rtfm and such, i know
<wasamasa>	vfw: read the wiki you must
<godginrai>	why would you need a wrapper?  doesn't pacman have a setting for setting a downloader?
<d_garbage>	timofonic, still don't see what the rush is
<mar77i>	so, apparently x11 does font caching internally somehow.
<saivert>	i guess these days with faster and more stable connections the need for segmented downloading is declining
<timofonic>	d_garbage: these days i use more a soldering iron and a dmm than a keyboard :p
<vfw>	http://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadtop.aspx?c=us&lang=en&prod=hl5170dn_all
<d_garbage>	timofonic, update more often = less to download

<wasamasa>	!give vfw dry
<phrik>	vfw: don't repeat yourself
<sudokode>	saivert: indeed
<timofonic>	d_garbage: well, maybe i have a different point of view. to me, able to get updates at max speed is nice
<sudokode>	i remember when third party downloaders were popular
<mar77i>	is there a way to make it stop doing that or reload the data from disk?
<d_garbage>	timofonic, sounds like obsession to me
<sudokode>	what was that one on windows?
<timofonic>	d_garbage: it's not wasting time while updating, anyway...
<godginrai>	sudokode: flashget
<sudokode>	uhhh
<d_garbage>	timofonic, start downloading and make a cup of tea
<sudokode>	that might be it
<timofonic>	sudokode: i don't use windows since... 15 years?
<godginrai>	i still know at least one person that uses it
<sudokode>	yeah, it's been a while since i've cared
<saivert>	yes mostly when the http ranged downloading was a new feature and browsers didn't support it yet. but download managers did. and they also handled ftp better than the built-in ftp in browsers.
<sudokode>	but that was when they were popular
<timofonic>	d_garbage: nah, i need to do tons of homework. this crappy managed vocational training school is driving me mad, i have too bad grades and half classmates are doing it shitty :p
<earnestly>	saivert: oh boy, ftp clients.  don't even try
<vfw>	phrik: i was trying to get someone to look at one of those two download sites to see if they could give me advise about which of the file formats would be easiest to use.
<sudokode>	http://www.georgedillon.com/freeware/screencaps/flashget.gif
<earnestly>	saivert: in a nutshell, they all suck
<sudokode>	i don't think that was it
<d_garbage>	timofonic, why worry about them, worry about your own shit
<vfw>	phrik: (wasn't trying to repeat anything.)
<timofonic>	d_garbage: i do
<saivert>	mostly because ftp as a protocol sucks
<earnestly>	saivert: most don't even include the more esoteric nonsense the rfc requires
<earnestly>	saivert: certainly

<guiburgueira>	is putty a good choice as ssh client for linux?
<sudokode>	yeahhhh
<timofonic>	d_garbage: anyway, my classmates don't help others. fuck them, they're seldom bastards
<sudokode>	also, love the add at the bottom
<earnestly>	guiburgueira: putty is a hack for windows because it lacks decent ssh clients
<wasamasa>	guiburgueira: use `ssh` on linux
<timofonic>	d_garbage: just a few help me a bit, fortunately. but not more
<wasamasa>	guiburgueira: putty is for windows, you sillyhat
<sudokode>	ad*
<d_garbage>	timofonic, help them then, instead

<earnestly>	sysgh0st: they did
<guiburgueira>	i looked into the repo but i was not sure which one i should get

<godginrai>	earnestly: install cygwin or msys, now you have a decent ssh client
<d_garbage>	timofonic, well, good luck with that
<timofonic>	d_garbage: thanks
<earnestly>	godginrai: oh, i know
<jupelius>	i used flashget long time ago
<timofonic>	d_garbage: if i had money, i would move overseas. i know adhd is better managed at other education systems...
<d_garbage>	timofonic, also adhd? might explain your impatience with the downloads?
<timofonic>	d_garbage: well, that too
<d_garbage>	:)
<sudokode>	lol
<earnestly>	how the fuck anyone could really trademark 'sky' in the first place beggers belief, but to now restrict others because they have 'sky' in the name?  no words
<wasamasa>	overseas they send kids with adhd into rural areas
<sudokode>	timofonic: ever been on a plane?
<wasamasa>	and make them plow fields
<godginrai>	jupelius: they are.  but i only know one person personally who still uses one.
<saivert>	putty is a forking hell. it also doesn't do ctrl + arrow keys for some reason
<sudokode>	doesn't seem like a fun place for adhd
<earnestly>	i still don't see any evidence to suggest adhd is a real thing either
<saivert>	cygwin + ssh + mintty (the terminal emulator based on putty but refactored heavily and actually works) is my recommendation
<wasamasa>	i'm not sure whether it helps them, but nobody's been hurt by physical exercise
<godginrai>	sudokode: scratch that, the firefox plugin was called flashgot.  foxget was something different <.<
<earnestly>	https://youtu.be/rsgkk1ggw3w
<wasamasa>	earnestly: that's the other problem
<saivert>	also you can stick with the openssh agent then instead of the silly pageant putty agent
<timofonic>	d_garbage: i do things at last minute, so i'm always in a hurry and full of anxiety. despite i know and try to fix it, my brain and bad living habits make it extremelly difficult to solve it. some people are unable to understand and repeat us all kind of shit like willing power and such :p

<saivert>	earnestly: some people just cope better with being like virtually anyone else
<saivert>	:)
<sudokode>	earnestly: they cover models of attention and adhd though
<timofonic>	sudokode: yes. i had a british gf living in benalmadena (i'm from spain) for a month and travelled to liverpool/wirral zone (norh england?). i had no issues with the plane, just the first time it was a bit afraid but i relaxed a bit. the weird shit is that i reaction a lot better in stressful situations than the rest because i'm stressed all time :)
<saivert>	adhd is a dangerous thing. kids are often misdiagnosed with adhd just becuause they are immature. or should have started school a year or two later
<saivert>	brains develop differently
<d_garbage>	adhd is a modern thing
<earnestly>	saivert: "misdiagnosed", i still don't even think it's a real thing
<earnestly>	that is
<saivert>	well they give them pills for it
<earnestly>	outside of the plethora of normal quirks people have
<saivert>	ritalin
<d_garbage>	bah
<saivert>	so it is real enough
<wasamasa>	earnestly: i hereby misdiagnose you as having adhd, too!
<earnestly>	wasamasa: i was/am apparently
<d_garbage>	it's just another way of saying, "flighty and energetic"
<jupelius>	can i also have a diagnosis?
<sudokode>	jupelius: denied
<wasamasa>	jupelius: i diagnose you as being lazy
<earnestly>	wasamasa: nevermind that the subjects were brain dead boring and i had much more interesting things to do.  yeah, adhd.  give him drugs.
<earnestly>	it's a bullshit "disease"
<d_garbage>	don't let a definition define you :)
<jupelius>	wasamasa: wow, you seem like a real expert
<jupelius>	that diagnosis fits me perfectly
<earnestly>	it's just as bullshit as aspergers
<sudokode>	earnestly: a disease is just a collection of symptoms. in the case of many psychological diagnoses, there are a range of symptoms and if you have a certain number, you're statistically likely to behave a certain way
<timofonic>	saivert: are you an adhd denialist? i'm damn fed of them, they think adhd is a conspiration of pharmaceuticals and such. i'm sure there's lots of missdiagnostics on adhd, but there's tons of undiagnoed adhd and specially adults. and most of them end being uneducated and doing bad jobs or even ending in jails...
<earnestly>	sudokode: https://youtu.be/rsgkk1ggw3w :p
<wasamasa>	earnestly: but hey, it lets me feel better about being socially... i dunno
<reisio>	dis-ease
<d_garbage>	indeed
<reisio>	adhd is certainly nonsense, though :)

<phrik>	title: nimh · attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) (at www.nimh.nih.gov)
<d_garbage>	that's kind of the origin
<saivert>	timofonic: sure, but they could just as well suffer from something else. as long as you are not deadly ill you are usually ignored by most people.
<reisio>	i saw a questionnaire to help one determine if you "have it" once, and anyone who ever filled it out would qualify
<sudokode>	it can be subjective, but that's the reason psychology needs more research
<reisio>	sudokode: or any research? :d j/k
<earnestly>	lol those symptoms
<reisio>	the problem isn't really adhd, it's 90% of people giving that as a diagnosis
<sudokode>	psychology does lack empiricism
<guiburgueira>	any good methon for transfering some gigs from a remote server and avoid corrupt files? ftp ins't that good i guess.. torrents take too long to hash
<wasamasa>	guiburgueira: rsync
<reisio>	the problem is always 90% of people
<wasamasa>	guiburgueira: you can use it via ssh
<d_garbage>	it is kind of conforting to give things a name though. i had many quirks as a child and it was kind of comforting to find out that this is called 'ocd'. it doesn't really change anything though
<guiburgueira>	wasamasa, thanks. i will learn it
<sudokode>	reisio: 90% is an important number in statistics :p
<earnestly>	guiburgueira: or scp or smb or maybe even nfs
<reisio>	sudokode: way
<sudokode>	though usually you wanna shoot for a higher confidence
<d_garbage>	beware pigeon holes
<hyo0301>	sudokode: i really dont want to fck up :(
<wasamasa>	guiburgueira: what rsync is especially good at is avoiding to retransfer things that are already there
<saivert>	fuck up how?
<sudokode>	you're going to
<sudokode>	sorry, but it's true
<sudokode>	but that's the fun part
<timofonic>	earnestly: yes, drugs are not so bad. our society demonizes drugs because lots of bastards use it in very wrong ways. mind altering can be very interesting for therapy too. drugs are like a blade, you can use it in all ways including bad ones. adhd is a brain dysfunction and amphetamines are the best way to help with having a better brain development, it was been studied for more than 60 years and even
<timofonic>	modern medications back to sophisticated ways of amphetamine (vivanse/elvanse)
<earnestly>	timofonic: sure, sure.
<saivert>	except using rsync in delta mode for initial copy is slow as hell. that is why you have the -w switch
<earnestly>	timofonic: show me these studies
<saivert>	wonder why rsync just doesn't automate that. it must realize the destination is empty and just do straight copy
<wasamasa>	saivert: til
<earnestly>	and how it's not just normal quirks
<d_garbage>	heh, in merry old england this is know as 'speed' :p
<sudokode>	earnestly: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/05/adhd-elevation_n_7216974.html
<phrik>	title: adhd rates are lower at higher elevations, study finds (at www.huffingtonpost.com)
<sudokode>	lol
<earnestly>	"talk nonstop", i know a few grandmothers like this
<wasamasa>	let's find a study over sixty years old and claim that a topic has been studied for over sixty years
<hyo0301>	is a swap file important?
<d_garbage>	poor man's cocaine
<wasamasa>	earnestly: lonely people are prone to this, too
<earnestly>	they just have a lot to say because no one listens
<timofonic>	d_garbage: ocd is more common than some people think. it's often a comorbid ill that appears with other issues. some adults end coping with it, but if there were more proper mental health professionals for everywhere we would be a lot better
<dpro>	hi
<d_garbage>	hyo0301, it performs a function
<wasamasa>	earnestly: i thereby declare being lonely as a disease!
<reisio>	ocd is a natural response to our absurd society, imo :)
<jupelius>	ocd = you can recognize patterns
<reisio>	take someone with ocd and put them in their natural environment (the woods), and they'll be right as rain
<sudokode>	ocd isn't a common diagnosis
<jupelius>	everyone should be ocd
<d_garbage>	timofonic, in the end though these are all just labels. if they help that's good. otherwise they are more a limitation
<sudokode>	actually, it's a common self-diagnosis
<wasamasa>	jupelius: more like, you feel compelled to do something about them
<reisio>	everyone should be ocd and hot
<sudokode>	a lot of people have ocpd
<timofonic>	earnestly: there's lots of studies about adhd, use google. i'm fed about adhd denialists, you wouldn't say that kind if bullshit if you knew people with adhd and specially severe ones
<earnestly>	ocd is a real disease and it's not "more common"
<sudokode>	which is a personality disorder
<wasamasa>	reisio: hot love in the woods?
<earnestly>	timofonic: i've used google, i've found nothing substantial
<sudokode>	ocd is much more serious
<sudokode>	generally involves a detriment to someone's life
<reisio>	i think ocd is just a symptom of being dis-eased by a demanding nonsensically technological society
<earnestly>	including death
<d_garbage>	we are all individuals, though we of course share similarities. beware of limiting yourself because of labels
<timofonic>	d_garbage: i don't limit, i try to surpass it. everything has labels on it, even operating systems :)
<d_garbage>	heh
<d_garbage>	good for you
<wasamasa>	timofonic: well, it doesn't sound like you've researched the topic critically
<saivert>	i'm actually tired though
<earnestly>	the symptoms of 'adhd' are just normal human quirks like being happy or sad
<tom^>	even my beers, and i dont try to limit myself after the alcohol %
<saivert>	but i cut out coffee 3 days ago
<tom^>	but it always ends bad.
<saivert>	guess it takes a couple of weeks for it to settle down
<earnestly>	"i do stuff at the last minute", like everyone else.  even mozart
<dpro>	anyone using a touchscreen/wacom tablet? i recently installed arch on my old thinkpad x60tablet and can't get the "touch" input to show up ...
<earnestly>	that's not a disease, that's normal human behaviour because we such at long term logic
<earnestly>	suck*
<reisio>	dpro: you can 'cat' things in /dev/input/*
<tom^>	dpro: the "touch" keyboard is a os feature.
<timofonic>	d_garbage: i just try to understand my issues and surpass them with effective ways. concerta helped me a bit, but after a few hours i back to being the same again
<reisio>	dpro: and find it
<tylerdurden01>	stallman's probably the best example of a high-functioning autist, though i personally believe that 90% of the people that are diagnosed with it/believe that they have it don't actually have it.
<d_garbage>	today's 'manic/depressive' (or bipolar perhaps in these modern times) is yesterday's towering creative genius
<sudokode>	earnestly: so is getting rubella and dying. we still vaccinate people
<d_garbage>	it's all just labels
<reisio>	when you're cat'ing the right input while you touch the screen, you'll get reliably corresponding output
<sudokode>	you can't walk? you're just lazy. stop pretending to have polio
<d_garbage>	if they help good, if not fuck them
<sudokode>	you have migraine?
<saivert>	adhd is highlighted because a lot of kids go through school and don't learn a thing because they can't fucking pay attention in class or absorb anything
<dpro>	reisio: yup
<sudokode>	oh please, take some aspirin
<saivert>	that is a waste of resources
<sudokode>	your migraine is just in your head
<sudokode>	my head hurts too
<d_garbage>	lol
<sudokode>	i must have a migraine
<d_garbage>	ouch
<sudokode>	we all do
<sudokode>	see how this works?
<tom^>	i googled my symptoms, im dying of brain cancer.
<d_garbage>	migraines are not funny though :)
<timofonic>	wasamasa: yes, i did. i did read tons of theories about adhd and even readed clinical studies. i self-diagnosed in some way, then i paid with support of my mother to a clinic of two professionals to do me a lot of tests and get a proper psychopedagogical diagnostic
<earnestly>	saivert: big surprise there, the education system is terrible.  you expect a kid to concentrate in a world full of 24/7 tv, handheld games and other entertainments at a swipe of a finger?
<sudokode>	tom^: that's not a tumor. it's a wart
<reisio>	imo you'd be crazy to want to pay attention in most classes in most countries :)
<tom^>	sudokode: oh good.
<sudokode>	a wart with cancer!
<d_garbage>	i get them very occasionally, and man do they fucking hurt :p
<saivert>	earnestly: no. because it is adhd. it is the monster that is killing us all
<saivert>	:)
<earnestly>	:p
<dpro>	tom^: no xsetwacom / xinput list report the (working) stylus and eraser, but not the touch input - that is my problem, used tp work in debian 5yrs ago, the laptop was on a shelf since then, kodibuntu live cd worked too, but i want arch!
<timofonic>	saivert: there's another issue, classes are boring and totally not stimulant in most cases. but the real problem is when you can't control that in certain way or you can't concentrate even on tasks you really like
<earnestly>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig9ce55wbty
<timofonic>	saivert: i have some way of ocd too
<earnestly>	wow
<tom^>	dpro: i dont think im getting what you mean with touch input then.
<d_garbage>	timofonic, now not being able to concentrate is a real thing and that needs to be resolved because it could hold you back
<saivert>	i sucked at school too. but my problem was i never asked for help. now i actually have a job in it but it wasn't without a lot of pain.
<dpro>	tom^: it's a tablet that supports the stylus (like a pen) and fingers (aka touch)
<timofonic>	tylerdurden01: hfas are so mainstream these days, but they are a minority.
<tom^>	dpro: oh.
<tylerdurden01>	earnestly: pfft. i hate the "schools are a way of turning you into a sheep" people so much.
<tom^>	dpro: i thought first you wanted something like this https://lh3.ggpht.com/nwu86ilyrbsshij9ngboy7tozrhwa348oqu_p-wxd-y17rdbeofnxescgnd7kr9_v3s=h900 :p
<earnestly>	tylerdurden01: you're not a sir
<d_garbage>	timofonic, on the other hand it all depends on what you find hard to concentrate on, there's always the chance that you can't concentrate on something because it's genuinely boring to you
<tom^>	dpro: an actual "keyboard"
<earnestly>	tylerdurden01: and you don't work in the education system
<saivert>	life is tough. period.
<d_garbage>	timofonic, and there lies the danger of labels
<earnestly>	tylerdurden01: your opinion is < shit
<hyo0301>	has anyone here done a dualboot with arch on linux?
<tylerdurden01>	earnestly: huh?
<saivert>	less than shit?
<reisio>	hyo0301: arch and what?
<earnestly>	saivert: < is typically 'less than', so yes
<hyo0301>	s/linux/windows 7
<sudokode>	wait, if you don't work in the field, your opinion doesn't count?
<tom^>	hyo0301: about half of us 2000 has.
<earnestly>	sudokode: it matters less
<saivert>	haha i just thought that was funny
<thelemonman>	arch'n'roll
<sudokode>	earnestly: does that mean you're a professional programmer, psychologist, economist, and philosopher?
<d_garbage>	!grab thelemonman
<phrik>	d_garbage: tada!
<sudokode>	you have a busy life
<reisio>	he's saying the mass of your opinion is less than the mass of shit, it's a compliment, really, unless the average shit is massive
<timofonic>	there's lots of autism behaviours in techy people too. it's common, that's people that have less social life. but that's not a real problem, despite this society force us to be hypersocial. the problem is not being neurotypical and maturity issues caused by adhd or other biological problems, in this case the therapy and prescriptions can help a lot if done properly
<hyo0301>	reisio:  i meant windows 7
<earnestly>	sudokode: nope, my opinions just don't matter much
<tom^>	earnestly: to me they do.
<reisio>	hyo0301: very little to it
<earnestly>	sudokode: it's very simple.  those who read the book entirely will have a more informed opinion than those who don't
<d_garbage>	timofonic, now that sounds more reasonable
<tom^>	earnestly: :>
<tylerdurden01>	earnestly: what are you going to protest next? hospitals? "hospitals are for pansies! if they wouldn't exist, natural selection would cull the weak and transform society for the better!"
<sudokode>	tom^: i thought you preferred my opinions
<earnestly>	tylerdurden01: i'm not really sure where you're getting these ideas
<wildefyr>	hi, x refuses to load now after working correctly on the latest kernel for sometime. using nvidia propietary drivers. xorg.0.log: https://ptpb.pw/qxj7 xinitrc: https://ptpb.pw/6ufz
<reisio>	hyo0301: hugely massively more than there actually usually is to it: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/windows_and_arch_dual_boot
<phrik>	title: windows and arch dual boot - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<earnestly>	tylerdurden01: and why you think i support them
<guiburgueira>	wasamasa, rsync doesn't show a progress stats?
<tom^>	sudokode: i prefer your statements, not your opinions.
<earnestly>	guiburgueira: it does
<wasamasa>	guiburgueira: if you don't tell it to
<timofonic>	tylerdurden01: you don't deserve your nickname
<sudokode>	a statement can't be an opinion
<d_garbage>	timofonic, except that 'biological problems' is kind of just another way of saying 'life' :)
<braindamage>	guiburgueira: it's optional, off by default
<earnestly>	guiburgueira: you can also show progress for the entire thing
<wasamasa>	guiburgueira: --progress
<reisio>	guiburgueira: man rsync, /progress
<sudokode>	?
<reisio>	guiburgueira: or just use -p, it's win
<wasamasa>	timofonic: ahaha
<sudokode>	christ so many people
<reisio>	that is, -p with your other opts
<reisio>	sudokode: twss
<sudokode>	responding at once
<saivert>	i agree humankind would be better for it if it though as a collective species instead of focusing too much on the individual. but here we are. where every man must fend for himself.
<reisio>	(the skank)
<saivert>	*thought
<earnestly>	sudokode: (we should call these new diseases "tumbler syndrome" or something)
<reisio>	wow, >2k
<ineb>	timofonic: you can try meditation to increase focus and attention span
<reisio>	that is new
<earnestly>	sudokode: especially the self-diagnosed ones
<sudokode>	earnestly: "new diseases"
<earnestly>	sudokode: yeah, like having 50 different genders
<sudokode>	well, that's why self-diagnosis is pointless
<guiburgueira>	thanks you all. now i see whats happening
<sudokode>	earnestly: you disagree with gender identity reform?
<timofonic>	d_garbage: well, our body issues and the life are both real problems
<d_garbage>	the pressure to conform has always been a double edged sword. it's just that in these modern times of mass media it gets more and more precise and restrictive
<saivert>	guiburgueira: did  you receive any help with your transfer issue?
<timofonic>	ineb: i tried it, i failed. i have difficulties to set up routines. i'm very messy and disorganized
<earnestly>	sudokode: i see it as inconsequential and a waste of time.  it's a western problem.
<sudokode>	earnestly: you'd actually make a great conversative talk show host in the us
<reisio>	mythomaniac: :)
<sudokode>	"grow some balls, stop being hyperactive, stop being depressed, vote for bush"
<d_garbage>	timofonic, 'messy and disorganised' could just be another way of saying, 'creative'
<saivert>	earnest tonight!
<earnestly>	sudokode: :p
<sudokode>	:>
<wasamasa>	d_garbage: such optimism
<d_garbage>	why not?
<ineb>	timofonic: i struggled aswell, it took time. no instant results but overtime i noted a huge difference. still not perfect though
<earnestly>	sudokode: i was diagnosed as adhd.  it's a bullshit label that means nothing, medication does not really help either.  if you believe it'll help then, magically, it does.  sounds familiar
<d_garbage>	i despise conformism, while apreciating the benefits of teamwork
<d_garbage>	call me a weirdo if you like
<sudokode>	i was never diagnosed with it, but i can tell you the medication does work wonders
<earnestly>	sudokode: well, not ritalin
<sudokode>	no, adderall
<earnestly>	sudokode: that just hypes you the fuck up
<earnestly>	and then crashes you
<timofonic>	earnestly: gender identity is always something not binary, despite western societies forced to be male/female. it even changes because of culture. in some cultures the same thomg is considered for females and other for males. i myself don't care about these kind of stereotypes, i'm sensible and have atypical hobbies anyway. here most people love soccer, i don't care at all and i find most sports very
<timofonic>	boring
<sudokode>	depends on the dose
<demonicmaniac3>	earnestly: ritalin is quite fun. friend of mine used it when studying for exams to focus
<earnestly>	timofonic: gender is a biological matter, nothing more
<demonicmaniac3>	even though he doesn't have adhd
<timofonic>	earnestly: not exactly
<earnestly>	yes, exactly
<sudokode>	demonicmaniac3: if you've ever tried to learn cash flow statements by hand, it works wonders
<d_garbage>	timofonic, gender itself is just another label. it's a concept
<sudokode>	god, that accounting class
<demonicmaniac3>	earnestly: wait are you saying transgender people don't exist?
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: what?
<saivert>	earnestly: at least you got the label on you. i was never diagnosed anything. went through eeg scans, mr scans, etc. nothing showing up. i'm in essence not sick of anything.
<halcyon_b>	earnestly, i think you're confusing gender with sex
<d_garbage>	individual vs society is a battle as old as people, it just take new forms as the years go by
<ineb>	saivert: whats your problem then?
<demonicmaniac3>	i just tabbed in here i didn't follow but the saying gender is a biological thing and diagnosis and such
<sudokode>	saivert: what are your symptoms
<saivert>	ineb: hopelessness
<demonicmaniac3>	was just wondering whether you meant adapting biological gender to "mental" gender is something you think is a waste and stupid
<sudokode>	anything else?
<wasamasa>	saivert: you're a hypochondriac!
<ineb>	saivert: whats the cause for that? :)
<demonicmaniac3>	merely a question since i didn't catch all of the discussion
<wasamasa>	saivert: and possibly have a case of the münchhausen syndrome!!
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: i can claim to be a flower, i exist as someone who claims to be a flower, but biologically i am not.
<sudokode>	saivert just has saivert's disease
<tom^>	!grab earnestly
<phrik>	tom^: tada!
<tom^>	earnestly: our precious cute flower. ;)
<wasamasa>	lol
<timofonic>	earnestly: there's not two genders, there's an infinite spectrum between male and female. and the male and female can be considered as some kind of subspecies in any sexual animal, but gender identity is constructed by both environment and biological differences. that's why there's transgender people, some of them consider themselves intersexual and don't want genital surgery, it's not just because the
<timofonic>	damn prostitution issue
<wasamasa>	is earnestly our angry sunflower?
<d_garbage>	in the end, "live and let live" is the only thing that ever really makes sense, where circumstances allow
<earnestly>	timofonic: your eyes are brown
<saivert>	nah. nest time i'm at the doctors office i will just stay there until they diganose me with something. anything does it.
<saivert>	*next
<tylerdurden01>	timofonic: are you from a scandinavian/germanic country?
<hyo0301>	i did it
<timofonic>	tylerdurden01: no, i don't
<saivert>	i want my damn label so i can get on with my life
<d_garbage>	:)
<jrun>	does freetype still ship ftview?
<earnestly>	jrun: nope
<sudokode>	earnestly: that is literally american conversative talking points right there
<sudokode>	you should run for office over here
<d_garbage>	!ontopic
<phrik>	go to #archlinux!
<timofonic>	earnestly: most population has brown eyes, there's some tendency in homogenity
<d_garbage>	}:]
<earnestly>	sudokode: i just go where the science leads, not what tumbler says
<tom^>	mine is green :<
<tylerdurden01>	timofonic: where are you from then? :p
<hyo0301>	all i need to know now is when to  remove the usb safely??
<sudokode>	"first you let the gays marry, then people will wanna marry turtles!"
<jrun>	any light replacement for ftview?
<ineb>	saivert: why do you need an external label from someone?
<d_garbage>	!grab sudokode
<phrik>	d_garbage: tada!
<timofonic>	tylerdurden01: i'm from some country that maybe your conservative mind would hate
<godginrai>	hyo0301: when to remove usb safely for what?
<tylerdurden01>	timofonic: i'm romanian
<wasamasa>	hyo0301: `umount`
<earnestly>	sudokode: it's funny how because i have one kind of opinion, it's automatically lumbed into some category :p
<timofonic>	tylerdurden01: i'm from spain
<tom^>	i would marry a turtle if i could. just because religion is meant to be joked with.
<saivert>	ineb: so next time people who look down at me can get a straight up answer and just shut up about it
<jrun>	is this archlinux?
<tom^>	jrun: nope
<tylerdurden01>	timofonic: oh, now it all makes sense :p
<sudokode>	earnestly: what science?
<saivert>	"i suffer x, now leave me alone"
<halcyon_b>	what's archlinux?
<timofonic>	tylerdurden01: why?
<sudokode>	you're misquoting politicians essentially
<earnestly>	jrun: ftview is not packaged in archlinux
<d_garbage>	timofonic, careful now. assumptions are not the best way to counter assumptions :)
<reisio>	halcyon_b: it's a linux distro
<earnestly>	sudokode: nope, haven't done so
<wildefyr>	jrun: no, i asked for help but everyone is too busy talking about gender identity
<saivert>	everyone hurts
<guiburgueira>	saivert, yes i did. now i can see the stats. do you know if its possible to split download with it?
<tom^>	wildefyr: what you need help with.
<wildefyr>	hi, x refuses to load now after working correctly on the latest kernel for sometime. using nvidia propietary drivers. xorg.0.log: https://ptpb.pw/qxj7 xinitrc: https://ptpb.pw/6ufz
<timofonic>	tylerdurden01: your country is fucked up too, maybe some of them are different. but in the end, we have similar issues
<earnestly>	anyway, this conversation is braindead, so i'll stop.
<halcyon_b>	reisio: heh, yeah, sorry.  just kidding.
<reisio>	halcyon_b: kidding?!
<saivert>	did it go full circle yet?
<d_garbage>	everyone and everywhere is fucked up. this is a besic premise
<guiburgueira>	saivert, i read the manual but can't find a option for split downloading in rsync
<saivert>	i don't think so. so lets continue a bit
<wasamasa>	earnestly: let's talk about the superiority of programming languages instead
<timofonic>	d_garbage: i know, i just wanted to give back the same coin :)
<halcyon_b>	reisio: it
<earnestly>	wasamasa: yes, that's sort of ontopic at least
<saivert>	guiburgueira: i never said anything about split downloading
<trolleader>	wildefyr: what's &! btw
<halcyon_b>	it's like a joke, but without the laughing.
<d_garbage>	timofonic, that's generally a  mistake, imo
<guiburgueira>	saivert, i know
<timofonic>	d_garbage: but some places are worse than others
<tom^>	wildefyr: blacklist nouveau, and really -syu you are way out of date.
<d_garbage>	timofonic, no, not really
<tom^>	wildefyr: wait sorry read "build date" and not current operating.
<timofonic>	d_garbage: i'm not christian, i don't give my face to get kicked again. at least not intentionally
<guiburgueira>	1mb/s for 30gb isn't that good :s poor routes
<tom^>	wildefyr: so you are not way out of date :p
<earnestly>	d_garbage: (well, they are, but it's not a very precinct thing to say.)
<wildefyr>	tom^: get your facts straight, will try blacklisting
<d_garbage>	people are the same the world over, it's the failure to realise this that causes 99.99% of all the world's problems
<hyo0301>	thanks wasamasa
<earnestly>	d_garbage: (sometimes the sky isn't exactly blue)
<wasamasa>	earnestly: lisp is fun, but doesn't teach you much, haskell teaches you lots, but is no fun, c will save us all, then let us shoot in our foot again
<wildefyr>	trolleader: i don't actually need the &! there thanks for pointing it out
<d_garbage>	earnestly, sometimes it's pink
<hyo0301>	can i make a primary bootable file, then make one extended to swap?
<wasamasa>	earnestly: anything else i forgot?
<reisio>	what we really need is c with infinite parentheses like lisp
<tom^>	wildefyr: but its like you are missing nvidia or nvidia-utils
<timofonic>	d_garbage: when you have no employment opportunities and everything is going down, rising the levels of homeless people and unable to get food... that starts to become really fucked up
<earnestly>	wasamasa: c is general purpose, the others aren't ;p
<trolleader>	is &! legit?
<jupelius>	reisio: let's make one!
<wildefyr>	tom^: they're installed, trust me
<tom^>	wildefyr: it finds the libgl but doesnt load the module :s
<d_garbage>	timofonic, details
<timofonic>	d_garbage: say it to something at south sudan, they are really fucked up
<earnestly>	trolleader: in what context?
<wasamasa>	earnestly: oh right
<trolleader>	what's the difference between &! and &
<trolleader>	earnestly: bash
<d_garbage>	timofonic, it's all realtive
<d_garbage>	relative
<reisio>	jupelius: combined with befunge
<wasamasa>	reisio: well, chicken comes close enough for me
<throstur>	 wxversion.ensureminimal('2.8') is raising an wxversion.versionerror, but i have the latest wxpython from the repositories, is this a problem with wxpython or what?
<trolleader>	earnestly: i mean, run things in "background"
<thelemonman>	wasamasa, who needs feet when you can fly ? :p
<reisio>	wasamasa: just reminds me of return to oz, in caps like that
<wasamasa>	reisio: it doesn't have the numerical tower by default, has fun interop and the interpreter can segfault at you if you cause interrupts while doing network io
<d_garbage>	timofonic, dont' confuse political/economic conditions with the human condition
<d_garbage>	don't*
<earnestly>	trolleader: &! is not documented in bash
<wasamasa>	reisio: still no clue about the last one but it sure tripped me up
<timofonic>	d_garbage: here in spain the unemployment rate is very high, despite political lies. the few benefits after the fake democracy are getting eliminated. technology is something not so profitable compared to tourism and drugs, prostiution.
<timofonic>	d_garbage: both are the same
<anonymauz>	i can't open and rename files with cyrillic titles, both in terminal and dolphin. how can i fix that?
<d_garbage>	timofonic, no. abolsutely not
<jupelius>	timofonic: sounds like a good place to visit then
<timofonic>	d_garbage: human condition is the reason of political/economic ones
<trolleader>	earnestly: thanks. i thought i missed something
<d_garbage>	timofonic, no
<d_garbage>	timofonic, imo
<timofonic>	jupelius: yes if you have money for it, but not for natives :)
<reisio>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4lhgxlziyq#t=35s
<tom^>	wildefyr: which gpu is it anyways?
<earnestly>	trolleader: in zsh, &| will automatically background and disown, it's equivalent to `cmd & disown`.  |& on the other hand in both bash and zsh is short hand for redirecting stderr into stdout
<wasamasa>	reisio: writing your own lisp in c should come close enough
<earnestly>	essentially |& is the same as 2>&1 >
<wasamasa>	reisio: or using chibi perhaps since it still needs a good shaking
<d_garbage>	timofonic, the human condition is eternal and universal. political and ecconomic conditions come and go
<anonymauz>	 can't open and rename files with cyrillic titles, both in terminal and dolphin. how can i fix that?
<jupelius>	earnestly: isn't that &> ?
<timofonic>	d_garbage: why not? political and economical conditions are just a way to try to fix our human condition, but it often fails. maybe there's some really bad done stuff in our biology and education :)
<d_garbage>	in other words, as i said before, people are poeple
<earnestly>	jupelius: sorry yeah, replace > with |
<d_garbage>	timofonic, no
<timofonic>	d_garbage: they never disappear, just evolve
<earnestly>	timofonic: https://youtu.be/nnnigh9g6fa
<tylerdurden01>	d_garbage: why should it be? that you and i should come along so awefully!
<saivert>	we are not evolving shit
<tylerdurden01>	*get alone so awfully
<d_garbage>	people are people, always. societies come and go
<tylerdurden01>	so many different colors and with different creeds! and different people have different needs!
<d_garbage>	it's the difference between the miro and the macro
<anonymauz>	 can't open and rename files with cyrillic titles, both in terminal and dolphin. how can i fix that?
<timofonic>	d_garbage: we still have old political shit that is outdated and broken but still governs us, but in the end is the power that rules disguised in politics. we live in a plutocracy :)
<d_garbage>	micro
<wasamasa>	!give anonymauz dry
<phrik>	anonymauz: don't repeat yourself
<tylerdurden01>	it's obvious you hate, though i've done nothing wrong! i haven't even met you, so what could i have done?!
<anonymauz>	ok.
<earnestly>	tylerdurden01: shared your opinion
<wasamasa>	tylerdurden01: you've picked an inappropriate nickname
<wasamasa>	tylerdurden01: that's your crime
<tylerdurden01>	:d
<saivert>	sharing opinion, strike 1
<d_garbage>	timofonic, i just have to dissagree. i don't particularly feel like changing or challenging you opinion but i fundamentally disagree. let's agree to disagree
<trolleader>	vfw: by the way i think i was wrong about makepkg, it extracts deb (and rpm) with libarchive, not ar; though ar can do the job as well
<earnestly>	or just not agree at all and that's fine too :d
<timofonic>	d_garbage: well. we always try to separate things, but everything is relationed. anyway, ok...
<saivert>	talk more about systemd please. that is much more uplifting than this "human condition" thing.
<wasamasa>	systemd is awesome!
<godginrai>	saivert: omnomnom
<d_garbage>	saivert, not sure about that. more on topic certainly
<jupelius>	when i see someone in irc with a nickname from a movie, tv-show or something like that my first assumption is that (s)he/it is a retard with no imagination
<timofonic>	d_garbage: we still have stuff from romans, despite that empire disappeared. there's not rm -rf / in the real world
<halcyon_b>	honestly, i love the way systemd allows for custom services
<wasamasa>	timofonic: nukes
<godginrai>	timofonic: yea there is.
<agent_white>	i love whiskey. it quenches thirst and dries it both at once! what an amazing thing.
<d_garbage>	timofonic, we have agreed to disagree. i don't feel like continuing the discussion further
<timofonic>	wasamasa: just massive nukes would make something to disappear, and really it transforms
<mrelendig>	halcyon_b: all init systems allows you to make your own services
<halcyon_b>	i put an instance of moloch on an arch x64 server, and setting the initialization scripts as systemd services was a breeze
<saivert>	that is the joke
<hyo0301>	'-''----'-'-'
<earnestly>	timofonic: rm -rf only transforms too, or in some cases, does almost nothing physically
<earnestly>	it just unlinks()
<timofonic>	wasamasa: ask japan! two nukes and they are still there, despite they have americans watching them...
<earnestly>	at worst it converts 1's to 0's
<halcyon_b>	yeah, but it it seemed a lot easier with systemd than i was really expecting.
<timofonic>	earnestly: yep
<earnestly>	your analogy fails
<demonicmaniac3>	rm -rf / is more like cutting internets to a country
<earnestly>	halcyon_b: if you want realllllllly simple, then s6/runit is really simple
<hyo0301>	linux should be called wiki
<timofonic>	earnestly: you interpreted it in a literal way, that's all.
<reisio>	rm -rf / is more like doing nothing at all
<demonicmaniac3>	unlink a whole country
<reisio>	because gnu knows better than you
<mrelendig>	!rm-rf
<phrik>	http://arch.har-ikkje.net/gfx/rm-rf.jpg
<earnestly>	timofonic: i always do, it bypasses the bs :p
<timofonic>	demonicmaniac3: like north corea? :)
<earnestly>	korea*
<reisio>	loverly story: http://justpasha.org/folk/rm.html
<phrik>	title: rm -rf (at justpasha.org)
<grawity>	earnestly: so i recently found an actual use for rmdir being separate from unlink >_>
<timofonic>	earnestly: who cares about spellings, the use of k is just politics
<earnestly>	grawity: do explain :o
<grawity>	earnestly: needed to write a script that cleans up empty directories, recursively
<earnestly>	grawity: a nice niche to find :p
<earnestly>	grawity: i assume, find -exec rmdir?
<timofonic>	reboot
<trolleader>	timofonic: what about north cocoa
<grawity>	anyway, it just calls rmdir() for every directory, and descends into those which result in enotempty
<grawity>	doesn't even stat() >_>
<earnestly>	grawity: :o
<timofonic>	trolleader: it's okay. cocoa is a nice stimuland in it's purest form. some cultures even smoked it. but i think cocoa must be united and available for everyone, no borders!
<d_garbage>	"a hard man is good to find" - a phrase that some ladies have sometimes used that made me laugh ;)
<earnestly>	grawity: i wasn't aware that it recursed like that
<grawity>	it doesn't; my script does
<grawity>	since i couldn't get `find -depth -exec …` to properly skip non-empty dirs
<earnestly>	grawity: find . -type d -empty -exec rmdir '{}' + ?
<grawity>	hmm, maybe with -depth, yes
<timofonic>	d_garbage: hard men or women don't need someone to be happy :)
<earnestly>	grawity: why use -depth?
<d_garbage>	timofonic, it's a play on words
<grawity>	earnestly: because you need to remove children before you can remove the parent...
<d_garbage>	timofonic, from the classic phrase, "a good man is hard to find"
<earnestly>	grawity: oh, i was under the impression rmdir could do that, hm.
<trolleader>	hard woman heh
<timofonic>	d_garbage: oh, i'm not native english. i fail at these language details, sorry :)
<grawity>	earnestly: oh, apparently it does
<d_garbage>	timofonic, no worries
<earnestly>	grawity: do you need -p for it?
<timofonic>	i prefer hard women, like my tea :)
<d_garbage>	timofonic, i am english with a love of the english language, this sometimes makes me hard to follow. i also appologise for that
<earnestly>	timofonic: can you actually please perhaps go to -offtopic now?  i'm sorry as well
<thelemonman>	reminds me of this http://lolsnaps.com/upload_pic/hardatwork-47045.jpg
<timofonic>	earnestly: that's not a problem. i'm really interested in improving my english knowledge. i want to get a high level of written and spoken english, maybe work/study overseas...
<demonicmaniac3>	watch 8 out of 10 cats
<demonicmaniac3>	that teaches you all the innuendo you'll ever need
<d_garbage>	timofonic, earnestly is refering to another channel #archlinux-offtopic. it's more of a social, chatty channel which is associated with this one
<timofonic>	after all, english is what esperanto tried to be
<timofonic>	d_garbage: i agree
<d_garbage>	timofonic, if you haven't tried it, check it out
<timofonic>	anyway, reboot
<halosghost>	d_garbage: it's a sesspoll
<d_garbage>	trolleader, try to join #human-race
<saivert>	that was mean
<d_garbage>	good
<trolleader>	d_garbage: that doesn't exist
<trolleader>	but ##english does
<d_garbage>	indeed
<halosghost>	saivert: what was?
<saivert>	d_garbage comment about joining #human-race
<d_garbage>	most everything
<halosghost>	ahh
<saivert>	:p
<earnestly>	grawity: http://ix.io/ijy seems to work, i guess
<trolleader>	i wish there's a #troll
<lemonxah>	hi
<d_garbage>	i wish you wern't
<saivert>	why? when there is one in every channel
<saivert>	at least
<sudokode>	#troll forwards to ##unavailable :(
<lemonxah>	it seems that my term is not picking up my http_proxy env variable
<earnestly>	sudokode: d:
<anonymauz>	why my pacman -syu proposes me to remove kde-frameworks and install kde-workspace :~
<trolleader>	^ sudokode
<d_garbage>	because there's always people who feel good about making other people feel bad
<tigrmesh>	people with nicks that contain the string "troll" tend to be viewed with suspicion
<trolleader>	lol
<d_garbage>	tigrmesh, <3
<sudotroll>	what? me?
<d_garbage>	:p
<tigrmesh>	anonymauz, have you looked at the arch home page?  maybe there's a news item about it
<d_garbage>	!sudokode
<phrik>	sudokode is a mega furry!!
<tigrmesh>	huh
<lyonsb>	that would be kind of like logging into #whitehouse with username "potuskiller6969"
<lunatic>	tigrmesh: anonymauz no news, but there's great change yes
<halcyon_b>	lemonaxh: what are you trying to point through your proxy?
<anonymauz>	to workspace? wtf, i don't understand :c
<lunatic>	just some renaming i think
<lunatic>	not sure about the reason
<tigrmesh>	they used to put that kind of thing on the news.  or on arch-dev-public
<lunatic>	well maybe the maillist idk
<anonymauz>	tigrmesh: https://www.archlinux.org/? there's nothing about it
<phrik>	title: arch linux (at www.archlinux.org)
<saivert>	arch news hasn't been updated in a while. not even with linux 4.0
<earnestly>	anonymauz: https://www.archlinux.org/news/transition-of-kde-software-to-the-kde-framework-and-qt-5/
<phrik>	title: arch linux - news: transition of kde software to the kde framework and qt 5 (at www.archlinux.org)
<earnestly>	anonymauz: it is on the front page still
<saivert>	i guess some people are responsible for writing those...
<mrelendig>	saivert: nope
<lunatic>	earnestly: that one is not exactly relevant
<saivert>	mrelendig: well that explains it then
<lunatic>	they try to eliminate "framework" from package names i think
<mrelendig>	saivert: we have 9001 monkeys locked up in a cage
<lunatic>	*recently
<earnestly>	i wonder why people need to 'generate' manuals.  they're so trivial to write with really light markup
<earnestly>	man(7) people
<lunatic>	like polkit-kde-framework to polkit-kde-agent
<earnestly>	and man-pages(7)
<mrelendig>	earnestly: i use rest because i'm lazy
<lunatic>	man archlinux <3
<thelemonman>	earnestly, pod ftw
<earnestly>	mrelendig: fine, but actual manuals are less verbose to write
<mrelendig>	nha more verbose
<earnestly>	than asciidoc, pod, ronn, rst, md, etc.
<earnestly>	much less verbose
<saivert>	restructuredtext you mean?
<saivert>	or markdown
<saivert>	to man
<earnestly>	saivert: either one
<earnestly>	the worst is needing latex like \f ...\fr
<anonymauz>	it's january topic
<earnestly>	which aren't needed exactly since you can just use .b, but that needs to be the beginning of the line so you split lines on it
<earnestly>	which is okay, just eh.
<anonymauz>	i tried -syu yesterday, it was up to date
<godginrai>	lunatic: that's actually really neat
<earnestly>	mrelendig: the macros for manuals are well defined, rst is more general, and thus more verbose
<kirito>	yay, latest networkmanager upgrade broke my internet
<d_garbage>	did it?
<d_garbage>	really?
<kirito>	cba to figure out what's wrong with it, will just never upgrade networkmanager again i guess
<anonymauz>	so  now frameworks will be workspace?
<anonymauz>	or what
<d_garbage>	or did your failure to handle the update properly break your internet?
<earnestly>	anonymauz: plasma handles all of that, no?
<anonymauz>	handles what
<earnestly>	workspaces
<earnestly>	the plasma desktop
<kirito>	how does one "handle" a minor version upgrade?
<d_garbage>	anonymauz, they are both the same thing really, two diffrerent name
<bshah>	frameworks is library and plasma is workspace..
<hyo0301>	why can't i add physical volume ?
<earnestly>	kirito: "cba to help"
<hyo0301>	or isn't that necessary?
<earnestly>	kirito: will just never help kirito again, i guess
<anonymauz>	:: replace baloo-frameworks with extra/baloo? [y/n]
<bshah>	anonymauz: y
<d_garbage>	kirito, i don't know i was basically reponding in a knee-jerk fashion to your whining
<kirito>	earnestly, networkmanager is a pain in the ass and not worth the trouble
<earnestly>	kirito: would you like some cheese with your whine?
<anonymauz>	and same it goes for kf5 frameworks. they are marked as removal
<anonymauz>	is it allright?
<earnestly>	anonymauz: yeah, they were all renamed iirc
<bshah>	anonymauz: can you put up exact output?
<anonymauz>	it ouputs changes line by line, i should press yes everywhere to get final output
<anonymauz>	i ll try tho
<bshah>	okay
<lunatic>	yes "" |?

<earnestly>	nizumzen: trademarking "sky" as a word is insane.  to then disallow others which have the text 'sky' *in* their name, in a completely different design is something i have no words to express
<reisio>	bshah: far out
<sudotroll>	earnestly: you don't trademark a word
<earnestly>	muchweb: remove 'quiet' from the kernel command-line
<kirito>	apple has a billion dollar pattern on the use of a shape
<sudotroll>	you trademark a brand name/logo
<godginrai>	muchweb: your systemd doesn't print anything out during boot?

<muchweb>	earnestly: kernel is printing messages, but not the systemd
<earnestly>	sudotroll: then how do they explain this if neither logo is remotely similar besides the word itself?
<sudotroll>	d_garbage: what's my logo?
<tingol>	i have trouble mounting usbs, here's what dmesg says http://pastebin.com/0ddqmckx, they don't show up as /dev/sdx or in by-id sections...
<muchweb>	godginrai: it says 'version 216' or similar to this
<d_garbage>	sudotroll, 'your' logo?
<sudotroll>	earnestly: that's probably why it's so ridiculous
<earnestly>	muchweb: sorry, but all you need is a kernel command-line without quiet and it'll print exactly that
<mrelendig>	tingol: pacman -q linux && uname -r
<d_garbage>	sudotroll, mine now, i think you'll find
<earnestly>	sudotroll: perhaps so
<muchweb>	earnestly: i see.
<nizumzen>	earnestly: sky is a brand that has been around for years in europe and is very well known - that is why microsoft had to rename skydrive to onedrive

<earnestly>	saivert: not always
<earnestly>	saivert: they're usually handed out like candy and then fall over when challenged in court :p

<sudotroll>	trademark laws don't particularly bother me
<d_garbage>	oh dear god, are we on to laws now?
<reisio>	bshah: why, because you think i said something i didn't?
<reisio>	just read the words :d
<earnestly>	d_garbage: nah, copyright.  an issue close to open source :p
<reisio>	here's another tip, trolls won't stop talking to you
<mrelendig>	tingol: pacman -q linux-lts
<sudotroll>	the only part that upsets me is if a company can go after an individual because of trademark misuse
<reisio>	i'm only talking because _you_ won't stop talking to me

<tigrmesh>	d_garbage, what is?
<tingol>	mrelendig: linux-lts 3.14.40-2
<sudotroll>	there should be a clear distinction between corporations and individuals

<earnestly>	sudotroll: hehehe
<d_garbage>	!give tigrmesh
<phrik>	d_garbage: give <an alias, at least 2 arguments>

<earnestly>	sudotroll: i thought they were the same thing ;p
<tigrmesh>	huh
<saivert>	sudotroll: yes it is. it is called wealth
<d_garbage>	tigrmesh, the <> around the links
<sudotroll>	earnestly: well, a corporation has to have the properties of an individual but be made up of individuals
<sudotroll>	it's an odd thing, but corporations actually why things persist so long
<earnestly>	sudotroll: establishments tend to stick around
<sudotroll>	because the goals of the corporation can be clearly laid out as opposed to the goals of the individuals that make up the corporations
<tigrmesh>	yeah.  wonder why.  can commas be in urls?
<tigrmesh>	d_garbage, ^^
<halosghost>	ptpb.pw is pretty great
<earnestly>	tigrmesh: yep

<mrelendig>	jupelius: actually it does matter
<tomty89>	obviously this vdt is not a very good acronym
<earnestly>	atrigent: it could either be that it's the correct name but uncommon or someone just wants to be smart
<lartza_>	yeah i am not sure how much arch downloads from the net and if it causes inconveniences to then upgrade

<disappointment>	wtf
<hyo0301>	mrelendig: i don't know, but grub is working. it's just that arch linux doesn't show up there, only windows 7
<selby>	i just want to know why the little script doing the least amount of lifting is using triple the cpu and ram than all the others
<selby>	it's just not right
<tomty89>	sigh http://ix.io/ik5
<earnestly>	sudokode: pony's makefile is pretty insane anyway, so i'm a little scared to try and fix it myself
<selby>	but, in other news... i figure out that awk is like a gift from the gods
<sudokode>	earnestly: have you talked to them about it?
<halcyon_b>	hyo0301: did make grub.cfg and install grub from inside the chroot, and do you have os-prober installed there?

<hyo0301>	yes, yes, and yes
<hyo0301>	halcyon_b:
<selby>	tomty89: it's so simple, i honestly dunno what else it could be
<halcyon_b>	it's probably pretty tough, but do you have networking setup enough to rsync or scp the grub.cfg off the unit and put it in a pastebin?
<tomty89>	:|
<halcyon_b>	the grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg should find your instance of arch.
<earnestly>	writing grub.cfg's manually is so much nicer :(
<tomty89>	^
<hyo0301>	apparently it doesn't it finds windows 7 loader on /dev/sda1 but no arch linux wtf!?!
<selby>	ah, i found it
<tomty89>	hyo0301: something wrong with your /boot i guess
<ingar>	earnestly: +1
<selby>	there is something seriously wrong with how forever.js monitors for system changes
<wolter>	i am using zsh but pressing tab never autocompletes options, it only prints "no matches for: `arguments' or `file'" how can i resolve this?
<tomty89>	selby: but really http://ix.io/ik5

<hyo0301>	tomty89:  what is that?
<selby>	bash forever
<tomty89>	hyo0301: grub.cfg
<hyo0301>	halcyon_b: should i check it in vim?
<ingar>	does grub need fstab ?
<tomty89>	check findmnt
<halcyon_b>	i thought the grub-mkconfig -o script used a copy of the fstab, does it not?
<d_garbage>	ingar, so, when is trem 3 happening?
<tomty89>	or ls -l *boot/
<bakednotfried>	hyo0301 forget about archlinux, it's only good for hipsters trying to act cool. install gentoo if you want a distro that actually works
<d_garbage>	ingar, }:]
<ingar>	d_garbage: it's called unvanquished :p
<d_garbage>	lmfao
<earnestly>	ingar: grub doesn't read fstab
<tomty89>	halcyon_b: it reads what you currently mount
<hyo0301>	tomty89: i can't copy paste, since i'm on my mac i'll have to write it manually ._.
<ingar>	earnestly: as i thought
<tomty89>	hyo0301: eh i didn't ask you to copy and paste
<bakednotfried>	hyo0301 mac? what are you homosexual?
<d_garbage>	!give hyo0301 sprunge
<hyo0301>	halcyon_b: how do i know if fstab is correct?
<phrik>	hyo0301: pipe or redirect your command or file into `curl -f 'sprunge=<-' sprunge.us`. this will upload to sprunge.us and return a link to the paste.
<earnestly>	ingar: (no bootloaders do, because they can't essentially)
<tomty89>	hyo0301: piece them up yourself
<d_garbage>	bakednotfried, not even funny
<hyo0301>	bakednotfried: because i'm installing arch on my pc
<teraflop>	today's troll day
<d_garbage>	bakednotfried, on so many levels
<tattoli>	mac os x is worlds most advanced operating system guys
<halcyon_b>	hyo0301 don't worry about your fstab, apparently it reads your current mounted vols, according to tomty89
<selby>	i took me all fucking night to build a disk monitoring script only to realize my server is using 5 gb > http://www.selby.io/about/server
<bakednotfried>	hyo0301 echo fstab > /etc/fstab should do the trick
<ingar>	tattoli: max os x is world's most advanced walled garden
<tomty89>	wat
<reisio>	tattoli: heh
<selby>	but it works on localhost too, so that's pretty nifty
<d_garbage>	bakednotfried, mac hate is kind dumb but homophobia will get you kicked from here
<halcyon_b>	hyo0301 let's focus on your grub.cfg and see if we've got something wrong in there or if the arch entry is missing entirely
<holomorph>	bakednotfried: troll elsewhere
<tomty89>	isn't echo fstab > /etc/fstab enough
<bakednotfried>	mac os is great if you like wearing fancy watches and dance around in a tutu
<tomty89>	i think that's banable

<earnestly>	selby: yes, awk is amazing, glad you've discovered as well
<sudokode>	why even worry with bash
<earnestly>	also your pipelines are horrible
<selby>	meh, i'm learning
<tomty89>	lol
<selby>	last time i did this in c
<earnestly>	blkid has options, so does lsblk
<hyo0301>	maybe it's because mkinitcpio didn't work halcyon_b ?
<earnestly>	your c must be terrifying :p
<selby>	oh, earnestly lol
<sudokode>	selby: what are you doing here?
<selby>	i copied that from the internet
<sudokode>	always a good idea
<selby>	only the sysuuid part
<sudokode>	so what does it do
<hyo0301>	in grub.cfg there is nothing on grub.d/10_linux
<selby>	it outputs du as json and sends it to mysql
<tomty89>	hyo0301: are you generating outside (arch-)chroot?
<sudokode>	oh boy
<halcyon_b>	do you see anything in 40_custom?
<selby>	or to an express sever, then mysql.  then i get to see what's taking up space in interactive pie chart form: http://www.selby.io/about/server

<selby>	what is the difference between a shell scripting language and any other scripting language?
<earnestly>	selby: you can write standalone awk scripts with #!/usr/bin/awk
<sudokode>	i'll give you "awk is like bash" because they both set up an environment and allow you to run commands, but bash and awk have different points
<tomty89>	do we call shell script a language?
<earnestly>	selby: nothing much
<sudokode>	one is a shell, one is for parsing input
<earnestly>	selby: although shell scripts are focused more on stictching together "real" commands as it lacks the facilities to write them yourself
<sudokode>	which is why awk is more like perl
<d_garbage>	don't mind me. i failed yet another job interview and so decided to get drunk. so sorry if i'm not making much sense :p
<bougyman>	awk does not have an interactive mode, it's just a programming language. bash is an interactive shell that can also be used non-interactively.

<hyo0301>	tomty89: even thought i have mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda4*
<selby>	yeah, i dunno. i guess it makes sense if you're doing a make install
<earnestly>	wasamasa: vodik redid his makesfiles, see: (note the definition of the ragel rule): https://github.com/vodik/envoy/blob/master/makefile
<tomty89>	hyo0301: you don't install grub to a partition usually
<phrik>	title: envoy/makefile at master · vodik/envoy · github (at github.com)
<selby>	but all my makefiles have been for personal development so i wanted the binary to be there
<earnestly>	wasamasa: note how easy it is to alter common rule definitions so you don't have to constantly repeat the same thing over and over
<tomty89>	hyo0301: and if you plan to have a partition for /boot, make sure you have it mounted correctly
<hyo0301>	tomty89:  i know, but i wanted to re-install it but now it says install device isn't specified.
<earnestly>	make can be so elegant and nice
<earnestly>	(except for the pitfalls and legacy)
<hyo0301>	tomty89:  i did, i mounted sda4
<selby>	earnestly: it looks like a cos wave
<wasamasa>	earnestly: thanks
<tomty89>	hyo0301: because it looks like you mounted it when your pacstrap, but maybe later you reboot or so to (re-)install grub, and you forgot to mount it again
<wasamasa>	earnestly: guess i'll have to add a variable for the executable name to not repeat that either
<tomty89>	hyo0301: or vice versa, or mounted incorrectly
<vangap>	tomty89 : it seems like they are dirty objects since they are not getting cleaned up ..or its some other cache.. https://gist.github.com/vanga/6c353737be923914c788
<phrik>	title: meminfo (at gist.github.com)
<hyo0301>	tomty89: holy shit you are so fcking right
<hyo0301>	tomty89:  i did reboot to check f12 and boot order
<selby>	wasamasa: you should set up a github page for that

<tomty89>	vangap: *in linux, i think
<tomty89>	vangap: but ask some expert about that
<selby>	wasamasa: my bad, i didn't see the link lol
<godginrai>	that deal with it guy is left-handed
<hyo0301>	tomty89: only thing i need to know now is do i need to do "mount base-devel /mnt" or something?
<hyo0301>	since i rebooted
<s00pcan>	godginrai: and?
<tomty89>	hyo0301: what
<tomty89>	hyo0301: mount base-devel? you mean pacstrap?
<hyo0301>	pacstrap yes
<godginrai>	s00pcan: it's just a curious tidbit
<tomty89>	hyo0301: not necessary
<tomty89>	hyo0301: you can install it later anyway
<selby>	wasamasa: du bist einer deutschleander?
<tomty89>	hyo0301: or them, it's a group
<wasamasa>	selby: *deutscher
<hyo0301>	no, since i can't fix this sht and mkinitcpio
<selby>	wasever
<wasamasa>	lol
<tomty89>	hyo0301: that's not relevant probably
<godginrai>	wasever xd
<tomty89>	wasaever
<hyo0301>	it works now! tomty89
<godginrai>	!gab tomty89
<godginrai>	!grab tomty89
<phrik>	godginrai: tada!
<selby>	ich habe nur 4 jahre studeirt
<tomty89>	beautiful
<vangap>	tomty89: even i though so that kernel can take back the cached memory, but seems like it hasn't been, oom killer is happening, and the thing that i can't clear cache manually makes me think some thing else is going on..
<vangap>	thought*
<tomty89>	vangap: your memavailable is suspicious indeed
<selby>	my german teacher was terrible too.  he was ex-cia and only taught language because he happened to know them.  he was the art director. -.-
<tomty89>	ex-cia :o
<earnestly>	wasamasa: actually repeating executables and object files /can/ be clearer, but usually it's a good idea to group them up
<selby>	every day he'd our lesson would be making us write sentences on the chalk board so he could make fun of us.
<hyo0301>	tomty89: now i'm in grub resuce wtf
<octocpp>	if i connected to a tftp server like   tftp 192.168.5.232  and i am now at the tftp>  prompt,  when i do   'put  myfile' it can not find it, and when i do  'put /home/octo/myfile' is cannot find the file ?

<selby>	earnestly: do you know a good resource for learning ack?
<sudokode>	selby: building a tcp stack?
<selby>	what do you mean by that?
<sudokode>	what's ack then
<thelemonman>	man ack ?
<selby>	it's like grep
<sudokode>	you mean awk?
<thelemonman>	it's like ag, but it's perl
<selby>	omg
<sudokode>	lol
<sudokode>	now he gets it
<selby>	then wtf is ack
<sudokode>	that's why i mentioned tcp :p
<selby>	sudokode: no, it's a thing
<selby>	http://beyondgrep.com/
<phrik>	title: beyond grep: ack 2.14, a source code search tool for programmers (at beyondgrep.com)
<selby>	but i was so confused
<thelemonman>	dazed and confused
<sudokode>	oh
<gjdan>	hm
<gjdan>	arp-scan is broken?
<selby>	thanks sudokode
<selby>	i do want to build a tcp stack eventually, though =p
<sudokode>	no you don't
<sudokode>	stay away from networking protocols
<diegoviola>	i tend to just use grep but i like the output of ack/ag
<sudokode>	by the time you finish with tcp, you'll end up writing your own stack over udp
<selby>	diegoviola: i thought awk was ack for some reason
<sudokode>	which is what a lot of proprietary tools do :d
<sudokode>	!moar sctp
<phrik>	moaarrr sctp!!! mmmoooooaaaaaarrrrrrr!!!
<selby>	sudokode: i've already done a little tcp thing
<thelemonman>	the next step is using udp and then bitch on so about dropped/shuffled packets
<sudokode>	selby: "tcp thing"?

<phrik>	title: selbyk/sps · github (at github.com)
<selby>	wait
<sudokode>	oh no, i meant actually implementing tcp
<sudokode>	this is just using a tcp socket
<selby>	no, that's not the one
<sudokode>	which is about as close as you wanna get to it
<thelemonman>	maybe you meant https://github.com/selbyk/python-udp-ping
<phrik>	title: selbyk/python-udp-ping · github (at github.com)
<selby>	ah, yeah
<selby>	not tcp

<namarrgon>	hyo0301: have you already rebooted into the installed system?
<jasper>	is there going to be support for split-debug-info packages in arch at some point? i'm an upstream developer, and a user just came to me with a crash report, and then decided not to pursue it when realizing that the would have to recompile their entire system to get a better crash log :(
<jasper>	it would be really useful from an upstream perspective for arch to provide debug info.
<forgottenarcher>	good point jasper!
<sudokode>	jasper: which package is this?
<jasper>	i found a bunch of bug reports, all of them closed saying "needs support in makepkg", even though makepkg support landed three years ago.
<jasper>	sudokode, i'm an upstream developer of mutter, working on wayland support.
<sudokode>	ah
<sudokode>	so that's a lot of stuff to rebuild
<jasper>	so that would require debug packages of glib/gobject, mutter, gtk+, xlib, etc.
<jasper>	yes.
<vdv>	i'm trying to establish usb connection to my android device using this instructions https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/android#connecting_to_a_real_device_-_android_debug_bridge_.28adb.29
<phrik>	title: android - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<vdv>	and it doesn't work :)
<sudokode>	i dunno. i'm not even sure why debug was removed to begin with
<vdv>	that's all for summary
<sudokode>	and ofc being a binary distro, there's no magic way to change that
<halfwit>	lunch!
<vdv>	i run adb devices and my device is not listed there
<jasper>	sudokode, split debuginfo landed over ten years ago by this point.
<vdv>	device is zte blade
<halfwit>	did you enable developer mode?
<sudokode>	vdv: are you on x86_64?
<jasper>	sudokode, there's a way of providing separate debuginfo to gdb
<vdv>	sudokode, nope
<noremi>	vlc's ui elements, such as the toolbar, are double height, anyone know why this could be? (http://imgur.com/ylnorov)
<phrik>	title: imgur (at imgur.com)
<vdv>	halfwit, yes i've enabled it
<noremi>	other gtk apps like gimp look fine
<vdv>	halfwit, settings --> applications --> development --> usb debugging
<holomorph>	lol 50 shades of grey honest trailer
<sudokode>	heh
<sudokode>	is the movie out?
<halfwit>	android-udev, android-tools, etc?
<halfwit>	(and is it showing up on lsusb)
<vdv>	halfwit, yes
<vdv>	halfwit, and also added current user to adbusers group
<namarrgon>	jasper: it's just that nobody bothered to build the packages and provide them in a repo. so far the consensus seems to have been that it's not worth it for the few occasions when they are needed.
<vdv>	halfwit, and double checked whether udev rules exist for zte in /lib/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules
<jasper>	namarrgon, would it be possible to have that added to the official packages / infrastructure?
<jasper>	namarrgon, all the arch users i've talked to are disappointed when they hear they have to rebuild their entire os to provide a useful bug report.
<vdv>	halfwit, maybe there's some special product id for my device?
<namarrgon>	jasper: the infrastruction would need a bit of tweaking i'd assume
<namarrgon>	*structure
<vdv>	halfwit, bus 006 device 006: id 19d2:0083 zte wcdma technologies msm mf190
<vdv>	lsusb says me that
<jasper>	namarrgon, i'd imagine so too.
<homerj>	i shouldn't have pressed that button
<teraflop>	vdv: in which usb mode is the device? charge only?
<namarrgon>	jasper: one doesn't need to rebuild the entire thing of course but it could be argued that the archlinux "target audience" should be able to do a couple of rebuilds
<vdv>	here is output from udevadm http://pastie.org/10174376
<phrik>	title: #10174376 - pastie (at pastie.org)
<vdv>	teraflop, if i connect usb there's no popup
<teraflop>	vdv: heh it doesnt look good to me
<vdv>	but in status bar "usb connection for coping files to/from computer"
<vdv>	teraflop, why not good?
<vdv>	teraflop, i suspect debug mode is not enabled really
<vdv>	teraflop, even if i checked menu option
<teraflop>	vdv: if you plug the device  in a udb port it has to be some popup in the phone? isnt it? i have no device in adb devices when the phone is in charge mode
<teraflop>	usb*
<acz32>	why do all the cool kids use urxvt? why not something like terminator which does splitting or something else?
<dacoit>	cause cool kids use tmux as well
<acz32>	how is urxvt better for tmux?
<dacoit>	its not. tmux just performs a lot of terminator's features
<acz32>	so why not just xterm or something in that case? i just don't get why urxvt is so popular among the cool crowd
<vdv>	teraflop, if usb debugging mode is enabled, then there's on popup
<dacoit>	acz32: there is no cool crowd. urxvt has benefits like sick perl extensions. the cool kids are using termite these days anyway
<tylerdurden01>	acz32: seriously now, why are you so irritated by the fact that some people use urxvt? :p
<teraflop>	heh
<acz32>	tylerdurden01: i'm not irritated in the slightest. what part of my curiosity gave you that impression?
<teraflop>	acz32: i thought the cool guys use termite
<diegoviola>	what wm are the cool kids using?
<diegoviola>	i3?
<acz32>	maybe they do. i'm not cool so i don't know
<acz32>	i3 is the cool wm, yeah
<jasper>	namarrgon, that seems poor. the two users i've encountered had never even used ssh before.
<tylerdurden01>	acz32: the fact that you passive-aggressively label those who use urxvt as "cool kids"? :p
<acz32>	i think it used to be xmonad
<hduser>	test
<jasper>	namarrgon, it's also not just one rebuild, it's 10 or 15
<acz32>	tylerdurden01: i'm sorry you're that insecure but there was nothing to read in between the lines.
<dacoit>	!give hduser test
<phrik>	hduser: [fail]
<davidtcpip>	test
<teraflop>	^
<dacoit>	c'mon now
<teraflop>	acz32: i use termite and xmonad and im not cool at all
<demonicmaniac3>	baw
<demonicmaniac3>	youtube-viewer no werky anymorez
<earnestly>	funny that i3 uses to be the least "cool" wm to use
<namarrgon>	jasper: 15 are still not much considering how simple it would be
<tylerdurden01>	i use urxvt and dwm. die of envy, acz32!
<demonicmaniac3>	drun stoopid google
<demonicmaniac3>	*durn
<willer>	teraflop: can you change font size on the fly with termite?
<tylerdurden01>	demonicmaniac3: i'm currently using the git version and there seems to be nothing wrong with it
<jasper>	namarrgon, why not just go full gentoo and not have binaries at all?
<demonicmaniac3>	tylerdurden01: try it
<willer>	teraflop: i've been thionking of using it
<demonicmaniac3>	stopped working the last 3 minutes
<teraflop>	willer: i don't (afaik)
<zack6849>	hey guys, i can't update my packages because lib32-cracklib seems to require a specific version of cracklib i can't get?
<willer>	k
<namarrgon>	jasper: then it would be gentoo
<demonicmaniac3>	youtube device support change shenanigans
<dacoit>	willer: yup
<jasper>	namarrgon, but it's so simple to rebuild 15 packages and won't take the entire day at all
<namarrgon>	jasper: without all the advantages but with all disadvantages :p
<zack6849>	i dont even know what that pakcage is, went to remove it but saw that lib32-pam required it, which im fairly sure is a pretty important library
<demonicmaniac3>	i watched with youtube viewer literally til 5 minutes ago and since then on all machines just that
<acz32>	tylerdurden01: i use a de. i'm not envious of someone using a wm with features that were around in the 1980s
<willer>	teraflop: it's possible with rxvt-unicode and i love it
<dacoit>	willer: in "selection mode"
<demonicmaniac3>	mpv works
<tylerdurden01>	demonicmaniac3: loaded some videos right now. some worked, some didn't.
<demonicmaniac3>	youtube-viewer doesn't
<earnestly>	willer: yes
<jasper>	namarrgon, is there nowhere i can file a bug or something to get split debuginfo added to the core repo set? is there some downside i'm not aware of?
<willer>	ah
<vdv>	teraflop, adb get-state -> unknown
<tylerdurden01>	demonicmaniac3: so try the git version
<teraflop>	willer: i let urxvt all for you :p
<demonicmaniac3>	tylerdurden01: i do
<demonicmaniac3>	i rebuilt it

<sheep>	yaomtc: either
<yaomtc>	right. source seems clear enough.
<charlesatum_>	no, it means that service origin
<charlesatum_>	i am just not sure if it is from ea or ubisoft
<sheep>	charlesatum_: you're being confusing.  he's specifically talking about what they mean in pulseaudio
<dacoit>	what
<demonicmaniac3>	origin is ea, uplay is ubisoft
<demonicmaniac3>	both are the devil
<trampel>	stupid question: what is the advantage of the udisks(2) package, given "udisksctl mount -b /dev/sdb1" vs (good 'ol) "mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt"  ?
<charlesatum_>	oh, right, sorry for that
<sheep>	trampel: udisks doesn't need root and it can automatically handle changing ownership
<charlesatum_>	do you have a multi-seat setup?
<sheep>	well, it doesn't require its user to be root
<trampel>	sheep: so it's all about ...loosen permissions?
<dacoit>	non-root mounting
<dacoit>	and handling
<trampel>	and that's it.  that's the main advantage?
<sheep>	mainly.  it's designed to make using removable media easier for regular users
<yaomtc>	aha! wikipedia explains it. "sources (processes or capture devices) and redirecting it to one or more sinks (sound cards, remote network pulseaudio servers, or other processes)."
<sheep>	it can also let file managers and stuff like that mount new devices automatically
<sheep>	yaomtc: it can even have remote pulseaudio servers as sources
<trampel>	so.... if i don't mind typing sudo... then i can just jollywell pacman -r udisks2 ...
<dacoit>	or allow super simple wrappers that implement automount
<sheep>	trampel: something may depend on it, so no
<charlesatum_>	!nuggets
<sheep>	not if something requires it as a dependency
<earnestly>	trampel: -rs is more appropriate as a "reversal of -s"
<sheep>	though you could just not use it, and you can remove it if it isn't required
<sheep>	also that
<trampel>	thank you earnestly (and sheep).  i always get lost in pacman alphabetsoup
<earnestly>	trampel: it's modal.  the capital options are the modes, only one of which can be active at atime.  each mode has an -h which prints a help summary for that mode.
<earnestly>	-s, -r, -q, -t and -d
<yaomtc>	from one server to another... i can't imagine a use for that, but someone has probably done it
<earnestly>	i like ip(1)'s command-line handling personally
<earnestly>	and likewise, nft(1)
<trampel>	but (and this is my fault), zb:    -s  is sync, search, or suckitdown  ;)
<earnestly>	trampel: -s just refers to the sync repos, -s searches the sync repo, when used under the -r mode, it means recursive because -r is already taken :p
<earnestly>	you can always use longopts if that's easier
<earnestly>	--sync --search or --remove --recursive
<dacoit>	guhh lol
<trampel>	i just need to etch it into a copperplate next to the keyboard (or postit note)
<earnestly>	!give trampel wiki pacman rosetta
<phrik>	trampel: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman_rosetta
<earnestly>	trampel: i find using -h or even the manual to be enough of a refresher, although i'm too used to the normal operations to need it anymore now heh
<trampel>	thank you.  already have that printed (somewhere) had to elide the redhat, suse, and gentoo to make it all fit
<ecraven>	wtf, now systemd requires acl support for journal? one more machine going to openrc...
<sheep>	ecraven: who the heck doesn't enable acls in this day and age?
<sheep>	even ext2 supports them
<drewsrem>	may someone be so kind as to hold my hand and tell me why i just can't seem to get autofs to mount my nfs share?
<ecraven>	sheep: sorry, every time i try to look at the good sides of systemd, i get angry again.. it's not only this... i'll just go with openrc, and be happy, like on the other machine :)
<sheep>	ecraven: over enabling a feature that's actually default on most new systems?
<sheep>	at worst this just requires adding ,acl to the fstab options
<ecraven>	sheep: no, over all the other problems i've run into with systemd and never had before (even at the risk of staying with an inferior system)
<sheep>	well fine then
<dacoit>	Õ_o you wont be happy with that attitude buddy.
<trampel>	systemd can be demanding church if one doesn't want to conform
<sheep>	but seriously, why would you disable acls?
<earnestly>	trampel: that really doesn't make any sense
<earnestly>	vague and shallow analogies rarely do
<trampel>	ah.  well, thankee anyway.
<dacoit>	trampel i dont worship my computer or flagellate myself when i disagree with developers
<ecraven>	one example, i've never had any problems with core dumps, but systemd freezes my entire system by default whenever something crashes
<sheep>	yeah, the way systemd-coredumpctl works is weird
<earnestly>	ecraven: have you submitted a bug report about that?  it shouldn't cause "freezes" (whatever that means exactly)
<sheep>	earnestly: it can cause a lot of disk overhead if the dump is big
<ecraven>	earnestly: no, because it has happened this way on every machine i've noticed it, and reading around on the internet shows that i'm not the only one with this problem, but it's "meant to be that way". i haven't found a way to disable core dumps from inside systemd, just with sysctl
<ecraven>	firefox for example creates big dumps
<earnestly>	sheep: ah, i have long ago since used kernel.core_pattern = /var/log/core/core.%t.%e.%p
<homerj>	oh, there's a way to disable that
<homerj>	hold on
<earnestly>	there is an rsc post about getting coredumps to appear locally, which is nice
<sheep>	that's the official way to do that iirc
<earnestly>	ecraven: is there a bug open about it?
<ecraven>	earnestly: no, as sheep said, it's about writing the dump as switftly as possible and thus blocking everything else
<sheep>	not necessarily
<sheep>	i'm not sure what it sets the priority for systemd's coredump thing to
<ecraven>	i'll just set core_pattern = /dev/null
<sheep>	if it's set low enough, it shouldn't interfere with other processes that need disk access
<sheep>	that works
<homerj>	yeah
<earnestly>	to be fair, coredumpctl is nice to use
<earnestly>	but it's wonky
<drewsrem>	someone here successfully using autofs to mount his nfs shares that is kind enough to share his config with me?
<earnestly>	you can easily disable the behaviour, so i'm not sure why it's a problem
<ecraven>	earnestly: it doesn't even have a delet command?
<earnestly>	ecraven: 'rm'
<dacoit>	drewsrem: no one fitting that description here, sorry
<ecraven>	earnestly: i deleted everything in /var/lib/systemd/coredump and still see two dumps
<earnestly>	ecraven: they're in the journal then
<earnestly>	see coredump.conf(5)
<ecraven>	earnestly: any way to delete them from there?
<earnestly>	you'd have to delete the journal files they're from
<ecraven>	how do i find those?
<earnestly>	like with any other kind of log deletion
<ecraven>	(also, *this* is one reason i don't like systemd :)
<ecraven>	not what it does, but its default settings, i guess
<earnestly>	ecraven: systemd-journald(8)
<dacoit>	journalctl is a dream

<ecraven>	earnestly: thanks, i'll  check whether that's what i'm seeing
<earnestly>	this bug report is full of idiots :<
<lartza_>	can agetty be disabled?
<sheep>	lartza_: why do you want to disable it?
<lartza_>	headless server
<sheep>	is there any way to access the system console?
<lartza_>	ssh
<lartza_>	well
<lartza_>	tty yes too
<homerj>	a serial port
<sheep>	ssh doesn't do the system console.  it creates a new psudeoterminal
<homerj>	null modem cable
<earnestly>	lartza_: no ttys are started unless requested
<lartza_>	so i need agetty? that's what i kind of asked
<lartza_>	it's a kvm vps so i guess tty1 gets spawned since i can enable vnc to get access to it
<earnestly>	or rather, they're launched on demand
<lartza_>	but vnc is disabled
<earnestly>	like ngetty
<earnestly>	used to
<ecraven>	earnestly: interesting read, very uncivil...
<sheep>	you may want to leave it open for tty1 just in case ssh breaks
<earnestly>	ecraven: i love this bit: http://ix.io/ikm
<earnestly>	as i said, idiots
<earnestly>	ecraven: i'm sure you can see the irony
<sheep>	there are a lot of jerks in the arch community, but they're not the majority
<alphaatom>	there are jerks in every community
<ecraven>	if i set the size limit for core dumps to hard 0 in /etc/security/limits.conf, i won't see any, right? systemd doesn't re-enable them in any way?
<earnestly>	sheep: the users, are the idiots
<earnestly>	sheep: dave is mostly fine
<lartza_>	you might be right sheep :)
<earnestly>	ecraven: why the fuck are you messing with limits.conf?
<earnestly>	ecraven: just set storage to none or change the sysctl
<sheep>	the community is mostly users
<lartza_>	there's no serial console access so vnc is all i get
<ecraven>	earnestly: i don't want any core dumps, period.
<earnestly>	ecraven: why?
<ecraven>	storage to none means i still get the dump, it's just deleted afterwards (says the wiki)
<ecraven>	i will never ever look at any (haven't so far), if i ever need that, i will re-enable it
<earnestly>	what about developers who want to see them for their software you're using?
<earnestly>	if you haven't looked yet, perhaps you should?
<ecraven>	noone has ever asked me, but i can always enable it again
<ecraven>	why? every time i debugged something, i used gdb on the running process
<ecraven>	i am not that elite :)
<earnestly>	:/
<ecraven>	anyway, thank you all for patiently helping me solve this (even if my solution may not be perfect)
<drewsrem>	it seems that on all my systems that use connman, when i mount an nfs share and then poweroff, the system gets stuck during poweroff and becomes completely unresponsive. - anyone else?
<earnestly>	ecraven: i guess you can hard limit the core to 0 then, meh
<earnestly>	idk, coredumpctl is really nifty imo, but if people never look to why their software is crashing (which should not happen), then it may be a bit of a hassle
<noremi>	an application is shown using double line height. why is that? (gtk)
<ecraven>	earnestly: at some point in the future, when writing core dumps does not freeze my system or mean i have to spend a lot of time getting it to work, i will revisit this :)
<earnestly>	although it's less useful as arch doesn't ship debug symbols (even though debug symbols have tenious use when programs are built with optimisations, but gcc/clang does a good job of preserving them regardless)
<jasabella>	hmmm plasma pulls in qt developer stuff
<earnestly>	ecraven: if coredumps are that large an that frequent, i'd probably worry a bit
<ecraven>	earnestly: well, this is an old laptop with a slow harddisk, that might make the problem worse
<}>	hey, i have a backup of /mnt/backups/var/lib/pacman/local , how would i install every package from that list? or every package that is in the offical repos

<leosw>	hello world
<}>	the arch wiki says pacman -qqen > pkglist.txt, but this is an external pacman db, not the one used by my system so -qqen wont work
<leosw>	is there a way in minicom to send bytes on the serial stream ?
<leosw>	(and not only output received bytes)
<sheep>	}: you can use the -r option in pacman to tell it where the root of the db is
<earnestly>	consider screen's serial support, honestly
<earnestly>	instead of minicom
<}>	sheep, oh, do i point it to lib/pacman or /lib/pacman/local ?
<sheep>	}: why is it in /lib/pacman?  is that a local db, or is it a sync db?
<}>	sheep, basically, my hdd died, i have the pacman db in my backups, i want to reinstall the system using the same packages

<homerj>	oh, look at the pkgfile

<homerj>	but in the post-install, there will be a thing that will do it
<arch-tk>	earnestly: i had to use the mythical @ to get my dbus python notification daemon working.
<earnestly>	arch-tk: well, this is ffi
<arch-tk>	earnestly: no idea why you sent me that.
<arch-tk>	earnestly: isidsisi
<earnestly>	thelemonman: there is literally zero information on that page
<arch-tk>	(i'm sorry, i don't speak in strange initialisations.)
<volvagia356>	well, i seem to be having some process on my system that umounts a particular drive the moment i mount it

<earnestly>	arch-tk: capabilities secure language, you don't see many of them
<reisio>	ah eric meyer...
<earnestly>	arch-tk: and not any that can compete with highly tuned c++ (faster than c, c++) on the shootout
<earnestly>	arch-tk: hoare actor model
<earnestly>	i'm mildly impressed with this language so far
<lmat>	how do i stop xfce over ssh?
<charlesatum_>	watcha talking 'bout?
<earnestly>	charlesatum_: ponylang
<charlesatum_>	pony?
<reisio>	lmat: why?
<arch-tk>	earnestly: oh that's pony
<dacoit>	lmat: systemctl
<arch-tk>	it looked an awful lot like python at first
<dacoit>	lmat: or kill
<lmat>	reisio: it's not running correctly... i'm trying to vnc to the machine, so i'm trying to run vnc properly.
<earnestly>	arch-tk: it looks like pascal to me, with a wierd mix of ml and rust
<lmat>	dacoit: kill what?   ps -ef | grep xfce; returns a lot...
<reisio>	lmat: what happens with vnc?
<earnestly>	lmat: pgrep
<dacoit>	-a
<arch-tk>	earnestly: nah, not pascal, not enough begin begin begin end end end
<volvagia356>	seems that anything i mount to that particular mountpoint automatically gets umounted...
<earnestly>	arch-tk: yes, it's just lowercase
<earnestly>	arch-tk: except => instead of begin
<arch-tk>	earnestly: i never wrote lowercase pascal, i guess that's why i don't see it.
<lmat>	reisio: it's not listening.
<}>	sheep, i think i figured it out, i had to use -b instead of -r, when -qqen and it seems to work
<earnestly>	arch-tk: also pascal doesn't require them be uppercase
<sheep>	ah
<arch-tk>	i know.
<earnestly>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pascal_(programming_language)#procedures_and_functions
<reisio>	lmat: well, that's not really xfce's job, it's the vnc server's/x module's
<arch-tk>	some people like lowercase, i like uppercase.
<sheep>	right, i never use that functionality in pacman
<earnestly>	that's why it looks like pascal to me
<lmat>	reisio: yeah i know. now i want to start vnc again, but it won't start because xfce's already running.
<earnestly>	or algol really
<earnestly>	kind of
<earnestly>	anyway, it's pretty interesting
<earnestly>	the code generation for simple stuff isn't too bad either given that it's gc'd
<lmat>	dacoit: systemctl doesn't know about xfce :-(
<earnestly>	although gc *can* be good, cf. azul gc for java.  it's just rare
<earnestly>	azul is a proprietary gc for java, that is
<arch-tk>	i don't care much for proprietary code.
<arch-tk>	i can't read it, i can't learn from it, it can go fuck itself.
<earnestly>	arch-tk: it gets results though, it's just a shame they have to compete in this market
<lmat>	i'll just reboot :)
<earnestly>	but their expertise shouldn't be too understated
<dacoit>	lmat: then kill the correct process. or restart the getty its on, depending on your goal here
<}>	sheep, i have but one question left, -qqen said there's 328 packages, but there's 1033 dirs in /var/lib/pacman/local/, does qqen find the smallest amount of packages it needs to install to include all 1033?
<sheep>	}: i think the -e flag tells it to list just the ones that were explicitly installed.  -qqn would list everything
<}>	oh, thats a good point, thanks again!
<earnestly>	oh, no wonder i don't see }, bsdbeard, ignored.
<arch-tk>	earnestly: i guess i'll look into pony.
<dacoit>	lol
<charlesatum_>	weird...
<dacoit>	i dont see {. otbs
<earnestly>	arch-tk: you just kind of have to ignore the "object-orientated" stuff, because well, that's all you can do.  class is essentially 'type' in pascal
<earnestly>	like it is in any language that uses the word "class"
<earnestly>	and stuff that claims you can run "thousands" of green threads always worries me.  those threads have to hit the tarmac at some point, they have to do userspace runtime scheduling, it still gets queues on cpus, cpu migrations and everything to stagger execution.
<lmat>	i am trying to run vncserver with an xfce desktop. i don't have xfce running on that machine, and i only have ssh access to that machine. i followed the instructions at https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/vncserver which say to put in ~/.vnc/xstartup the following:
<phrik>	title: vncserver - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<earnestly>	and can often lead to worse performance the more green threads you use as you suffer from little's law (if lockless).  if you instead use only the number of cores you actually have, you can see much better returns
<earnestly>	no need to do cpu migrations, local per-core caches can stay hot, prediction history can stay current to the execution since it doesn't have to context switch as much, etc.
<lmat>	#!/bin/sh  \n ... \n exec startxfce4;   i have that. now, when i run vncserver, i get a few errors:   x server already running on display :1 ... "gpg-agent returned no pid in the variables" and "xfsm_manager_load_session: something wrong with /home/lawsa/.cache/sessions/xfce4-session-calvin:1, does it exist? permissions issue?"   and  "failed to get the _net_number_of_desktops property."  and "error openin
<lmat>	g /dev/dri/card0: permission denied"
<pid1>	!ix
<phrik>	curl -f 'f:1=<-' ix.io
<lmat>	do i need to run vncserver as root? (it doesn't look like it in the wiki.)
<lmat>	pid1: okay, just for you :-)  just a sec
<earnestly>	lmat: well, "x server already running" might be a hint
<lmat>	earnestly: i don't think one was running, though :-(
<earnestly>	lmat: apparently one is
<lmat>	earnestly: i just restarted the machine. how do i identify the running x server?
<lmat>	there are about 80 processes running...  oh, i'll just paste the list...
<earnestly>	lmat: pgrep -a x
<lmat>	nothing
<earnestly>	then no xserver is running
<earnestly>	lmat: check if there are any sockets open in /tmp/.x11-unix/
<lmat>	i just ran vncserver.
<lmat>	it started up an x server
<lmat>	it did not issue the "x server already running error"
<lmat>	oap, just kidding...yes it did (in the log file, not stdout or stderr)
<lmat>	http://ix.io/ikp
<soni>	i need a bluetooth headset emulator
<mrelendig>	soni: write one
<mrelendig>	there are several free bt stacks you can use
<lartza_>	why is there a three dns maximum for resolved?
<lmat>	got it!
<mrelendig>	lartza_: because history
<lmat>	firewall problem, and needed '-a' to ss.
<lartza_>	fine
<mrelendig>	also it is not always max 3
<mrelendig>	depends on what lib you are using
<lmat>	i guess the errors are meaningless? ^_^
<lartza_>	well it complained when i put four and i ended up without ipv4 dns
<lartza_>	though i still can't get stuff to work, when i add both static ipv4 and ipv6 to my eth0.network dns and ipv6 won't work
<soni>	mrelendig, anything in lua?
<soni>	(other than luajit ffi ofc .-.)
<mrelendig>	!g lua bluetooth client library
<phrik>	mrelendig: lua toolbox: <https://lua-toolbox.com/>
<soni>	meh
<soni>	what about java?
<soni>	meh screw it i'll just use python
<mrelendig>	fuck java
<windowsrefund>	noted
<earnestly>	lmat: well, there were no errors really, kind of.  the permission denied could be how it expresses issues when network fails
<earnestly>	arch-tk: there is #ponylang now it seems
<arch-tk>	earnestly: i'll see you on the other side of the bandwagon.
<earnestly>	arch-tk: i sort of don't think this will bandwagon
<earnestly>	arch-tk: or maybe it will in 5 years or so
<addle>	lutin`, hey stranger. :p
<lutin`>	addle: hehe
<plujon>	while :; do date; sleep 1; done # is it normal to have multisecond gaps between the date stamps ?
<lutin`>	addle: ahaha that's great
<earnestly>	plujon: there's far too much going on in that loop to get accurate timing
<earnestly>	plujon: not only is it shell, not only are you execve()ing, but you're also executing date
<earnestly>	plujon: the kernel is also built with dynamic ticks,  you'd have to investigate a bit deeper i think
<plujon>	earnestly: well, i'm less concerned with accuracy and more with what's normal.  i'm on a quad-core (phenom ii), lightly loaded, and i'm surprised to notice 3+ second delays between invocations of date.
<plujon>	e.g., here is a sample output from the command on my machine: http://ix.io/ikw
<earnestly>	plujon: oh, i thought you said "millisecond" because multisecond isn't a thing
<hexhaxtron>	i'm trying to install a package and it says: /usr/sbin exists in filesystem
<hexhaxtron>	what should i do?
<holomorph>	fix the package so it doesn't try to create /usr/sbin
<plujon>	earnestly: ah.  yeah, multi-second delays.  the scheduling seems weird to me.
<holomorph>	vodik: maybe simpler example: can't do `gdb git` with the symlink in place
<mrelendig>	hexhaxtron: what are you trying to install?
<earnestly>	plujon: it could be that your sleep just started towards the end or beginning of the clocks second
<hexhaxtron>	mrelendig, i'm so lost with so many problems... i'm getting like 20 problems per day... i was trying to install rvm but i'm not even sure if that is the right package...
<plujon>	earnestly: well, i can watch it tick by, and there are clear delays once in a while.  4 seconds is a lot longer than 1...
<earnestly>	plujon: also, i only see one instance where there is > 1 second delay
<earnestly>	plujon: like i ... oh, i didn't say
<mrelendig>	hexhaxtron: rvm does not install anything to sbin
<hexhaxtron>	but it complains about it.
<plujon>	earnestly: 14:03:08 to 14:03:12 ?
<mrelendig>	link to the pkgbuild
<plujon>	also 14:03:18 to 14:03:21
<earnestly>	plujon: you'd have to write a program that uses a timerfd with clock_monotonic and see if it happens
<mrelendig>	also you should install rvm in home anyway
<mrelendig>	don't run the silly script as root
<earnestly>	plujon: see man 2 timerfd_create
<hexhaxtron>	mrelendig, i was doing packer -s
<mrelendig>	link to the package
<hexhaxtron>	how?
<lmat>	earnestly: ah, that makes sense
<mrelendig>	aur/rvm is not ruby virtual enviroment
<mrelendig>	hexhaxtron: ok, first step, learn wtf aur is
<earnestly>	lmat: well, not much sense, but eh.  software doing weird things with unexpected sitations
<mrelendig>	second step, find the package on aur.archlinux.org and post the link here
<earnestly>	plujon: there's an example in that manual which does almost exactly what you want
<earnestly>	plujon: then get out your tools and see
<earnestly>	!give plujon observ
<phrik>	plujon: http://www.brendangregg.com/perf/linux_observability_tools.png
<earnestly>	!give plujon observ-perf

<hexhaxtron>	mrelendig, see... another problem... and it has like this one after another after another for 3 or 4 days... gpg signature verification failed for '/usr/local/rvm/archives/rvm-1.26.11.tgz' - 'https://github.com/rvm/rvm/releases/download/1.26.11/1.26.11.tar.gz.asc'!
<mrelendig>	stop running that script as root
<vodik>	to remove it, or that it was a good idea?
<earnestly>	vodik: to remove the symlink
<earnestly>	being a good idea
<holomorph>	vodik: i wish i understood /why/ it works, for instance, in the shell, but is broken elsewhere
<earnestly>	holomorph: symlinks are like that :p
<holomorph>	insufficient
<earnestly>	so many pitfalls
<vodik>	holomorph: good question. me too. i certainly won't pull it out without understanding why
<earnestly>	holomorph: it could just be how it treats the symlink as a file
<plujon>	http://ix.io/ikz # several runs, some sane, some questionable
<earnestly>	plujon: the code may not be exactly what you want, it's mostly to demonstrate that it continues while backgrounded (monotonic clocks are like that)
<vodik>	holomorph: besides, the symlink really could just be a '#/bin/bash exec envoy-exec "$0" "$@"
<lartza_>	for some reason, i have gateway set as x:y:z::1 but ip -6 route shows x:y:z:a3::/64, why?
<earnestly>	vodik: but now you're starting bash :(
<vodik>	earnestly: it should already be in memory anyways :p
<earnestly>	vodik: heh yeah
<vodik>	ooh, i wonder if i could do this
<earnestly>	vodik: you could use /bin/sh though
<vodik>	#/usr/bin/envoy-exec\ngit
<earnestly>	just for portabilityness
<holomorph>	oh snap
<earnestly>	yeah you could if you use $0
<vodik>	hmm, yeah, it could be an empty file too then
<vodik>	if $0 is read
<earnestly>	although does the kernel need some kind of logic from your code to handle it?
<earnestly>	i assume no
<vodik>	earnestly: i'll certainly experiment
<plujon>	earnestly: thanks for the references; that timer does seem to exhibit the same behavior as the while; do sleep 1; date; done loop.
<plujon>	so, is it fairly normal for a process to request a 1 second sleep and be woken by the system 5 seconds later?  my cpu is at 6-8%...
<earnestly>	plujon: i guess the best thing to do is read more about timers in the kernel, write a program and then ask the kernel mailing list what's going on
<hexhaxtron>	mrelendig, what's wrong with this thing?...
<hexhaxtron>	$ /bin/bash --login
<hexhaxtron>	segmentation fault (core dumped)
<hexhaxtron>	$ rvm use 1.9.2
<hexhaxtron>	segmentation fault (core dumped)
<earnestly>	hexhaxtron: post your pacman.log
<ecraven>	plujon: that loop shows every second for me
<hexhaxtron>	earnestly, http://sprunge.us/jpbe
<hexhaxtron>	earnestly, oh... i'm using testing... i think that's why...
<hexhaxtron>	it didn't occur to me...
<earnestly>	unlikely
<infandum>	on my other computer, tomahawk player and clementine show non-english characters in song titles without an issue. on this computer, it's either missing or question marks or numbers. both use arch. i forgot what i downloaded to the other computer to make that happen. is it just missing fonts? could texlive fonts add them all?
<hexhaxtron>	earnestly, is testing the problem?
<earnestly>	unlikely
<hexhaxtron>	then what is it?
<mrelendig>	infandum: different font/locale
<infandum>	mrelendig: so i just need to install the right fonts?
<mrelendig>	if your locale is set correctly, yes
<earnestly>	hexhaxtron: not sure, but as an aside, you don't need to use -yy all the time and -r should be -rs usually.  why it's segfaulting, that's weird
<earnestly>	hexhaxtron: it smells like partial updates
<earnestly>	but there doesn't appear to be evidence of that either
<infandum>	mrelendig: well right now i have en_us-utf8
<earnestly>	hexhaxtron: when you use testing, do you use all of testing?  e.g. testing-community, testing-multilib, testing-extra, etc?
<hexhaxtron>	earnestly, yes.
<earnestly>	hexhaxtron: not sure then.  just -syu now, if it's still broken then, panic
<hexhaxtron>	i thought it would be cooler to be more up-to-date.
<earnestly>	hexhaxtron: segfaults aren't normal for software, especially bash
<earnestly>	even if you used unstable releases (which you aren't
<namarrgon>	post dmesg
<namarrgon>	if it doesn't segfault :p
<hexhaxtron>	namarrgon, http://sprunge.us/sifg
<earnestly>	segfaults usually mean debug symbols + gdb
<earnestly>	to try and figure out what it's doing
<namarrgon>	make it crash inside gdb
<earnestly>	just giving you the instruction pointer and stack pointer address isn't much help
<earnestly>	namarrgon: he'll just get a lot of '??' >(
<namarrgon>	if it dies in glibc it might be enough
<spaceone>	hmm.. archlinux doesnt have the latest python2-six which causes python2-matplotlib fail to import
<spaceone>	...
<tomty89>	so, at the end of the day, i found that gnome-icon-theme and cantarall-fonts are not hardcoded in gtk2, but just the gtkrc shipped with the arch package :3
<threegen>	spaceone build from aur?
<earnestly>	hexhaxtron: run `gdb` > set logging on > file /usr/bin/bash > run > when it crashes run 'bt'
<spaceone>	threegen: no, from official repos
<earnestly>	hexhaxtron: and then upload the gdb.txt which is created in the same directory
<earnestly>	hexhaxtron: you can exit gdb with 'exit' or ^d
<tomty89>	now i can embrace adwaita-icon-theme and ttf-dejavu happily <3
<mrelendig>	spaceone: uhm
<mrelendig>	spaceone: arch has 1.9.0
<mrelendig>	spaceone: latest on pypi is 1.9.0

<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: the title of that article != conclusion of article and that == me annoyed
<spaceone>	mrelendig: hmm... maybe matplotlib is not the latest...
<demonicmaniac3>	earnestly: yeah
<demonicmaniac3>	interesting find nonetheless

<tazmain>	night all
<reisio>	wow, all the tumbleweeds out there, and this one had to be photoshopped
<reisio>	mrelendig: seems informative
<reisio>	but lord, words are so much more useful than lectures/videos
<earnestly>	mrelendig: heh, "wait sill dua", almost a sentence
<thaweatherman>	anyone here use fbcmd?
<reisio>	probably someone
<thaweatherman>	i cant get the app to add permissions
<thaweatherman>	-_-
<thaweatherman>	google group for it is practically dead so now im just asking around places with lots of linux users
<reisio>	add permissions?
<thaweatherman>	fbcmd is a command line app for accessing facebook
<thaweatherman>	it needs to be granted permissions to function
<thaweatherman>	but the command in it for granting permissions doesnt grant all permissions needed
<escondida>	o,0 jesus, it's written in php
<thaweatherman>	yeah
<escondida>	thaweatherman: what permissions does it think it needs?
<guiburgueira>	any good pdf edting tool?
<thaweatherman>	escondida: by default it only grants viewing your own profile
<earnestly>	guiburgueira: nope :p
<thaweatherman>	escondida: if you want to post status updates, etc you have to grant more permissions
<earnestly>	guiburgueira: pdf is, well, i don't really know how to express the state of that format
<thaweatherman>	escondida: there was a script mentioned on the google group back in 2011 that adds all the others, and i tweaked it to fit the new oauth standard, but it isnt working
<earnestly>	!give guiburgueira yt c3 omgwtfpdf
<phrik>	guiburgueira: 27c3 omg wtf pdf - julia wolf (1/4) - youtube: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f2xmw3987i>
<escondida>	thaweatherman: rrrrright...so what permissions does it think it needs? is it trying to write to a directory somewhere and failing?
<earnestly>	guiburgueira: she does it best i guess
<thaweatherman>	escondida: oh it isnt local permissions, it's fb permissions
<guiburgueira>	i know pdf sucks hell but still have to edit this shit
<thaweatherman>	escondida: im just hoping someone here uses it and knows how to fix the issue
<escondida>	thaweatherman: looking at this thing...i'd say find a less insane client
<halfwit>	thaweatherman: i'm reminded of the weather girls
<earnestly>	guiburgueira: what kind of edit?
<thaweatherman>	escondida: i've looked around but this is the only one that pops up in searches for command line access to fb
<thaweatherman>	escondida: i could write my own but i would rather find something that exists lol
<guiburgueira>	earnestly, change a few words
<earnestly>	guiburgueira: you can maaaaybe do that with an ordinary editor like vim
<guiburgueira>	its from a "receipt" so i will change the date and that's it
<earnestly>	guiburgueira: i've done it a view times
<guiburgueira>	earnestly, i will try
<earnestly>	guiburgueira: how big is the document?
<escondida>	thaweatherman: it's years out of date, and its target site is, well, a moving target
<halfwit>	it's raining fbcmd! hallelujah, it's raining fbcmd
<thaweatherman>	escondida: yep pretty crappy
<earnestly>	guiburgueira: it basically should be full of pdf commands like [/foobar /baz >> and then a huge stream of binary gunk.  sometimes the words are in the plain and you can change them
<guiburgueira>	earnestly, 1 page
<escondida>	thaweatherman: also, just their readme should be sufficient to send you running \-:
<earnestly>	guiburgueira: should be trivial then
<earnestly>	guiburgueira: vim even has syntax highlighting for pdf files
<earnestly>	just search /for the wrong text
<anarchic>	i'm geting 404 errors on one package trying to install gnome via pacman...am i being an idiot, i'm an arch newb
<sheep>	anarchic: run pacman -syu then try again
<escondida>	anarchic: is your system up-to-date and your repos synched? run -syu and try again
<albertocg>	any idea on which is the best setup for android dev on archlinux?
<escondida>	!wiki android
<phrik>	escondida: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/android
<escondida>	albertocg: ↑
<anarchic>	yep, that worked..thanks :)
<escondida>	np
<thaweatherman>	escondida: found one called fbcli but it runs in a browser with a terminal so that defeats the purpose o_o
<escondida>	lol
<albertocg>	thank you escondida
<escondida>	np
<guiburgueira>	earnestly, didn't worked :s i think the old editor was encoding the text as image
<keenerd>	guiburgueira: import to inkscape and go nuts.  though if it is a pdf form then the big pdf viewers that gnome/kde ship can edit fields.
<earnestly>	guiburgueira: nope
<earnestly>	guiburgueira: vim writes it out unaltered
<guiburgueira>	https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/masterpdfeditor/
<phrik>	title: aur (en) - masterpdfeditor (at aur.archlinux.org)
<guiburgueira>	just found

<guiburgueira>	worked with some bugs but the job is done! =d
<coolthingy500>	oh come on. just because i use xfce and arch
<coolthingy500>	lol
<yans>	(:
<tigrmesh>	yeesh.  i'm ordering college transcripts online.  "for adobe reader 11 and higher, adobe flash is also required to view the transcript. "
<tigrmesh>	good thing i haven't watched earnestly's pdf video
<dacoit>	im watching it now. pretty great
<xyzaffa1r>	for some reason below a certain point pulseaudio stops working
<xyzaffa1r>	i end up with no sound
<tigrmesh>	i'd know whether i'd want to have them snail mail it.  or maybe pony express   ;)
<xyzaffa1r>	it is around 30-35% volume.
<tigrmesh>	dacoit, looks like it would be
<earnestly>	coolthingy500: it's slightly amazing that someone this old has managed to get through life without any kind of ... uh, cognitive ability or even learned demeaner
<tigrmesh>	earnestly, ?
<earnestly>	coolthingy500: i always thought the people constantly went around saying "lol m8 :) giggles" were teenage chavs
<earnestly>	tigrmesh: the video coolthingy500 posted
<earnestly>	tigrmesh: he was advising the linux community to get their heads out of their arse but wanted to decorated it with as many adjective as he could muster, after struggling a little he ended up with "juicy", to describe arses, it was hilarious.
<earnestly>	i wonder if he felt embarrassed for a moment about that slip, it seemed like it
<coolthingy500>	sometimes i do use a lol. but for the most part, i don't use slangs. although, the op on the video should have realaized that ms pays big money for oems to make sure their systems work well.
<tigrmesh>	haha
<earnestly>	coolthingy500: i just skipped through, stuff like this on youtube is dim-a-dozen
<dacoit>	is he the one who had a video whinging about the way some people pronounce mate
<madebymarkca>	that video hah
<coolthingy500>	yup
<coolthingy500>	then you got matt trying to debunk myths, while making myths
<coolthingy500>	my sides hurt that day.
<earnestly>	typically if it's not conferences, talks on linux found in video form are almost always wrong, misleading or dangerous
<dacoit>	"linux help guy".. have mercy
<coolthingy500>	qupsup isn't too bad. but he likes ubuntu or debian based systems
<earnestly>	dacoit: oh you want something, here's something: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imk_dhpotie
<dacoit>	dis gon be gud
<coolthingy500>	i like nano. not vim
<halfwit>	lol m8
<coolthingy500>	dear lord no
<dacoit>	who needs man pages or the seven greek epics on vim. its eli the computer guy
<halfwit>	earnestly: the conference talks i find to be rather awesome, i can't name them offhand
<coolthingy500>	he's nice. does cover a lot of stuff.
<coolthingy500>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvr5ltszdd0
<xyzaffa1r>	i tried adding: load-module module-udev-detect ignore_db=1 to my /etc/pulse/default.pa as this tells you to: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pulseaudio/troubleshooting#no_sound_below_a_volume_cutoff
<phrik>	title: pulseaudio/troubleshooting - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<xyzaffa1r>	but then i can't launch pulse.
<xyzaffa1r>	so i took it back out and now i have the problem.
<xyzaffa1r>	still.
<madebymarkca>	@daciot @earnestly https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsyt-7n5-1i ;)
<earnestly>	madebymarkca: what's this for?
<xyzaffa1r>	i am really tired of my music needing to be sooo loud :(
<xyzaffa1r>	pulse is dumb.
<earnestly>	[side note: i don't understand how people can work on code when 2/3 of the screen is wasted on not code.]
<madebymarkca>	intellij so good
<coolthingy500>	i would ditch pulse and use alsa gui front.
<earnestly>	coolthingy500: i wouldn't
<xyzaffa1r>	coolthingy500, i really like pavucontrol though :(
<pablotron>	hello?
<halfwit>	hello?
<xyzaffa1r>	pablotron, hello.
<pablotron>	ugh stupid irc client
<dacoit>	is it me?
<pablotron>	it was saying i was banned
<halfwit>	dacoit: classic line.
<dacoit>	halfwit: :d
<earnestly>	xyzaffa1r: whenever you think something is dumb, unless you have keen technical insight into why exactly it is, perhaps you should assume that perhaps it's the person between the keyboard and chair which is.
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly, i don't actually think it's dumb.
<halfwit>	earnestly: i love that.
<earnestly>	xyzaffa1r: my guess is you're not disabling flat-volumes and have slightly messed up .tdb files
<earnestly>	because flat-volumes seem to do that
<inder_gt>	madebymarkca: intellij is best :)
<xyzaffa1r>	ok
<earnestly>	inder_gt: madebymarkca: broken english is bestest, intellij so great
<madebymarkca>	o/\o
<madebymarkca>	go team
<earnestly>	team rocket
<dacoit>	*
<earnestly>	steals your pokemons
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly, turned off flat-volumes then restarted pulse, still no good.
<earnestly>	xyzaffa1r: like i said, messed up tdbs, remove them
<xyzaffa1r>	earneslty, oh ok, where are those stores?
<xyzaffa1r>	*stored.
<xyzaffa1r>	because i have no clue what they are.
<dacoit>	pulse config dir
<xyzaffa1r>	found em
<madebymarkca>	pulse is the worst thing ever
<xyzaffa1r>	thanks
<earnestly>	xyzaffa1r: tdb is based on the old unix ndb database system, came in unix6 or so.  anyway, pulse uses them to store volume levels, device settings, stream state and so on.
<dacoit>	madebymarkca: no u
<earnestly>	you can sort of inspect them with tdbtool
<acz32>	xyzaffa1r: you use arch now? last week you were struggling to use elementary os
<thrice>	madebymarkca: why do you say that?
<escondida>	madebymarkca: it certainly had that reputation a few years back, but these days it's quite nice.
<xyzaffa1r>	acz32, i always used arch, just wanted to try elementary.
<xyzaffa1r>	acz32, maybe if you would have payed attention instead of just argueing with me you would know :)
<earnestly>	now, now, only argue about technology
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly, thanks for the explenation, still no good :(
<earnestly>	xyzaffa1r: welp, what is the actual problem then?
<acz32>	xyzaffa1r: well it was hard to take you seriously, with all the begging and questions that even non-linux users know the answer to
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly, pulse is stupid and we should all switch to oss?
<dacoit>	whats going on here.
<xyzaffa1r>	acz32, it's hard to take you seriously when you are so thick skulled that you don't know when some one is screwing with you.
<dacoit>	hey now
<earnestly>	xyzaffa1r: i wouldn't use oss, even v4, as both are unmaintained and rely on in-kernel mixing which is a deadend as no floating point is allowed there
<holomorph>	earnestly: vim hg tip is… weird
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly, i was joking :)
<earnestly>	holomorph: whats what?
<earnestly>	xyzaffa1r: i wasn't
<coolthingy500>	sigh. some blonds shouldn't touch computers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rulzew2tt8
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly, ok.
<dacoit>	coolthingy500, :|
<holomorph>	the latest vim. `v` highlights the line and the invisible newline
<acz32>	xyzaffa1r: um, ok. you were messing with me by harassing people in an unrelated channel? uh huh
<dusty`>	hi
<earnestly>	holomorph: oh, let me build
<xyzaffa1r>	harassing is a stretch.
<holomorph>	if you're on an empty line the cursor is highlighted as nontext
<dusty`>	could anyone help me get sound working for wine in chroot?
<tigrmesh>	coolthingy500, ?
<holomorph>	(in a term, that is)
<dusty`>	im having  areally tough time with it, tried a bunch of things
<xyzaffa1r>	acz32, just leave me alone, please.
<acz32>	xyzaffa1r: i'm also starting to see a trend with your "joking" defense mechanism
<holomorph>	yay
<tigrmesh>	sorry guys.  bad night to be picking fights.  take it elsewhere
<tigrmesh>	you're both muted for 5 minutes
<halfwit>	in the red corner!
<earnestly>	holomorph: v is supposed to highlight the entire sentence, and the difference now is?
<earnestly>	sentence, being from ^ to $
<holomorph>	earnestly: it highlights one past $
<earnestly>	i guess i'll see
<earnestly>	current vim does that here
<earnestly>	holomorph: e.g. https://ptpb.pw/duzw.png ?
<holomorph>	earnestly: yep
<earnestly>	holomorph: that's what it always has done for me
<dusty`>	im not sure if it's to do with pulse audio, 32 bit vs 64 bit, chroot stuff...
<holomorph>	earnestly: wat d:
<earnestly>	dusty`: more likely permissions via acl
<earnestly>	holomorph: still gvim-hg                      7.4.640.r1.b64f0df9399c-2  7.4.728.r1.9782a8aa2d7f-1
<earnestly>	been awhile
<dusty`>	i do have my chroot user the same numerical id as my normal user (although they have differnt names) - woudl acl still be a problem?
<holomorph>	earnestly: 7.4.712.r1.18d84ed365a5 doesn't do it here
<earnestly>	dusty`: publish your users pulseaudio over a socket or tcp connection and have the pulseaudio in chroot use that server
<earnestly>	dusty`: i'm not 100% sure why you're using a chroot with wine either, but you'll have to overcome these issues
<earnestly>	even just getting xorg in a chroot can be tricky
<dusty`>	ill read up on how to do that and try, thanks!
<dusty`>	it's to increase security slightly
<earnestly>	be careful with xhost
<earnestly>	dusty`: it doesn't really
<earnestly>	dusty`: if you want, unlink the unixfs system
<holomorph>	ok, so between 712 and 726
<earnestly>	dusty`: then the wine prefix won't be able to read anything outside
<dusty`>	ooh cool!
<earnestly>	dusty`: wine regedit /d 'hkey_local_machine\software\microsoft\currentversion\explorer\desktop\namespace\{9d20aae8-0625-44b0-9ca7-71889c2254d9}'
<earnestly>	dusty`: and tee "$prefix"/.update-timestamp <<< disable
<earnestly>	!g winehq unixfs
<phrik>	earnestly: shell32 - the official wine wiki: <http://wiki.winehq.org/shell32>
<coolthingy500>	what do you use wine for dusty?
<dusty`>	bgb gameboy emulator
<earnestly>	dusty`: wait, bgb is?
<earnestly>	dusty`: why?
<xyzaffa1r>	am i unmuted?
<dusty`>	i'll try out this unlink stuff i tsounds really good
<xyzaffa1r>	cool.
<earnestly>	dusty`: linux has so many better emulators than that :/
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly, so not flat-volumes, not tbd, what's next?
<dusty`>	earnestly, i think only gambatte comes close in accuracy
<earnestly>	xyzaffa1r: paste amixer output
<freezingcold>	meh, i've been putting off the linux 4.0 update, anything interesting in it?
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly, http://sprunge.us/hztv
<phreakachu>	the number changed to 4
<escondida>	freezingcold: it's a fairly normal update, actually. check out the kernel mailing list announcement or kernelnewbies.org
<freezingcold>	escondida: if i'm not willing to reboot, do you think i'm willing to read a mailing list? :p
<earnestly>	dusty`: hm
<earnestly>	xyzaffa1r: so, what's the problem?
<escondida>	freezingcold: to you, those sentences may follow naturally...
<escondida>	s/sentences/phrases/
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly, moncapture?
<earnestly>	dusty`: oh, well, don't worry about using choot for that
<coolthingy500>	didn't even noticed a change to 4
<dusty`>	yea thanks very much for the stuff about unixfs!
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly, ?
<earnestly>	dusty`: mostly it's enough to just unlink the symlinks into home and disable winemenubuilder as a bonus
<earnestly>	dusty`: see https://github.com/earnestly/dotfiles/blob/master/.local/bin/mkwineprefix
<phrik>	title: dotfiles/mkwineprefix at master · earnestly/dotfiles · github (at github.com)
<earnestly>	xyzaffa1r: what?
<dusty`>	cheers!
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly, i don't know :(
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly, what is the problem?
<earnestly>	apparently none
<homerj>	i wonder why this keyboard doesn't do a scroll lock light...
<homerj>	if my hd problems today wasn't enough, my keyboard went belly up
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly, i don't understand.
<earnestly>	sudokode: https://macawmovies.wordpress.com/ heh
<phrik>	title: macaw-movies | an open movie organizer (at macawmovies.wordpress.com)
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly, what's going on?
<earnestly>	nothing
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly, i don't understand.
<escondida>	xyzaffa1r: *what* do you keep saying you don't understand?
<earnestly>	dusty`: i thought there were more, but it seems they're all varying degrees of gba
<xyzaffa1r>	escondida, well he was helping me, but now he just says there is nothing wrong.
<earnestly>	dusty`: but, libretro is very nice either way
<dusty`>	game boy advance im not sure, been using mess withour looking into it more - this is just for dmg and gbc
<dusty`>	libretro ill have to check out
<xyzaffa1r>	escondida, so i am confused, he just decided to stop helping and ignore me.
<dusty`>	there's higan too, but i found some serious problems in it
<earnestly>	dusty`: yeah, you can ignore higan
<dusty`>	(for gba, not snes of course)
<dusty`>	which is the best for i think
<escondida>	xyzaffa1r: it's a busy channel. don't buttonhole one person as your personal helper. address your questions to the channel, and anybody who can help, will.
<earnestly>	dusty`: you should check out libretro, definately.
<xyzaffa1r>	escondida, sorry, but he was in the middle of helping me, asked for output then just started ignoring me.
<earnestly>	dusty`: a consistent api for all emulators is very nice
<earnestly>	dusty`: that api includes everything from graphics, sound, input, shaders, etc.
<dusty`>	there's mednafen which has a struct that you fill out for various emulators
<escondida>	xyzaffa1r: so what exactly is the problem? that amixer output looks fine.
<earnestly>	escondida: well, i asked what the problem was and got nothing, so i assumed there's none
<escondida>	earnestly: ah
<dusty`>	it would be some serious work to pull that out into a library of its own though
<earnestly>	dusty`: mednafen is nice too, libretro has their emulators too
<escondida>	earnestly: figured it had to be something like that
<dusty`>	ah excellent!
<xyzaffa1r>	escondida, for some reason below a certain point my audio just doesn't work, it is around 35-40% volume
<earnestly>	dusty`: they have... quite a lot, and many of them have been picked up and improved internally
<xyzaffa1r>	i tried turning off flat-volumes, deleteing ~/.config/pulse/
<coolthingy500>	is mednafen a cli gameboy emulater?
<earnestly>	dusty`: they're basically rewriting mupen64
<earnestly>	xyzaffa1r: that's likely just audio drivers/hardware
<dusty`>	coolthingy500, a lot more than gameboy but yeah, and it adds networking
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly, so what do i do? this is my most recent arch install, but on my last one it works fine.
<earnestly>	xyzaffa1r: you might be using the wrong profile too
<tigrmesh>	what was wrong with this video?  also, some of my best friends are blond.  <coolthingy500> sigh. some blonds shouldn't touch computers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rulzew2tt8
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly, what do you mean? what profile?
<earnestly>	xyzaffa1r: in the configuration tab, if you want
<earnestly>	i assumed you did a little bit of self-study into this
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly, i tried to figure out the problem.
<earnestly>	so why don't you know about pulseaudio's profiles?
<halfwit>	tigrmesh: defaulting to stereotypes is silly :3
<earnestly>	!shrug2
<phrik>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯

<halfwit>	i don't like a lot women like them.
<halfwit>	try that again
<coolthingy500>	sorry. i'm tired.
<dusty`>	ty!
<earnestly>	dusty`: and improved as well.  personally, i don't care about accuracy very much and prefer quieter fans and a lazy cpu
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly, because i don't?
<earnestly>	because i don't remember "accuracy" as a kid
<earnestly>	it never mattered, unless it really does break things.
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly, i know what you are talking about now, didn't know it was called that.
<earnestly>	xyzaffa1r: you didn't read any manual then or check the files which came with the package?  meeeh.
<earnestly>	i thought you had
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly, there is this great little thing i saw on reddit the other day about something similar to this, i really really wish i could find it.
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly, i guess there isn't much point in bringing it up as i can't find it.
<xyzaffa1r>	but it was good.
<earnestly>	anyway, some people found selecting different profiles like the digital output duplex, helped
<earnestly>	usually for simple stuff it's that or analog output duplex
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly, that seemed to have worked, thank you for all your help.
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly, weird that the profile i normally use isn't working.
<earnestly>	oh well
<earnestly>	at least it is now
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly, some day i will find that post and then give it to you.
<xyzaffa1r>	earnestly, may take me a few months :)
<bentglasstube>	so every time i reboot, my computer doesn't recognize my midi keyboard because i have to load the snd_seq_midi module, is there a best practice for getting that to laod automatically with like a udev rule or some such?
<escondida>	bentglasstube: you can just add it to a /etc/modules-load.d snippet : https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/kernel_modules#automatic_module_handling

<firedingo>	so i have a bit of an issue. minecraft is picky when it comes to my graphics setup. i have an intel chipset and an nvidia card. i have bumblebee installed and it works fine. even in windows minecraft will not use the nvidia card unless i tell it explictly to use it. so i'm now wondering how might i go about doing this in arch linux. can someone point me in the right direction please?
<tomty89>	firedingo: i think that's the same case for bumblebee
<firedingo>	oh tomty89?
<tomty89>	you have to use optirun/primusrun to start a program so that it'll use nvidia
<firedingo>	ah ok. thanks tomty89.
<bfrog>	does anyone know if you can have grub installed on a normal sata ssd boot linux installed on an nvme drive?

<tomty89>	actually it seems kind of worse
<bentglasstube>	escondida: thanks i will probably do that i just wondered if there was a more "proper" way
<bentglasstube>	like writing a udve rule to load the module when i plug the device in or something which i guess i could do that too
<escondida>	bentglasstube: i mean, you could do that, but having the module loaded all the time won't hurt anything.
<voidead>	so for some reason chromium will not startup fast like it used to.. sometimes i have to "killall chromium" first and then try it again to get it to pop up.. here is an error: https://ptpb.pw/rnml anyone have any ideas on this?
<escondida>	bentglasstube: /etc/modules-load.d *is* the proper way of loading modules (-:
<bentglasstube>	i suppose that's true
<danavu>	hi, so, i'm stuck trying to get my fresh install to boot now that i'm using lvm
<jushur>	danavu: actual errors needed to give advice
<danavu>	i'm reading the grub page from the wiki and it says to make sure the lvm module is preloaded, and then to specify a default root, and when i did that, it couldn't find it.. i'm probably  messing up the syntax
<danavu>	i used grub_cmdline_linux_default="root=lvm/arch-root"
<danavu>	in my /etc/default/grub
<jushur>	danavu: grub_preload_modules="lvm"
<danavu>	jushur: i have that also
<jushur>	danavu: and your /boot is named root?
<danavu>	jushur: no /boot is outside lvm
<scimmia>	charlesatum, enough of the join/quit already
<jushur>	then your not actually booting a lvl system
<jushur>	lvm*
<danavu>	i'm gonna reboot again and try and remember what the error was
<charlesatum>	sorry for that scimmia, problems with emapthy, polari and my password
<jushur>	irc smartfilerters ftw..
<charlesatum>	i should file a lot of bug reports, soon.

<chromeeagle>	anyone know how to solve system update issue where i get a bunch of packages (like 8) that say: error: alsa-utils: signature from "anatol pomozov <anatol.pomozov@gmail.com>" is unknown trust
<chromeeagle>	:: file /var/cache/pacman/pkg/alsa-utils-1.0.29-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz is corrupted (invalid or corrupted package (pgp signature)).

<diegoviola>	i can't just get used to gnome 3, i always go back to xfce, i wonder why that is... sigh
<diegoviola>	:(
<scimmia>	chromeeagle, update pacman-keyring first
<charlesatum>	well... i somehow got used to it. not sure why though
<chromeeagle>	well, i saw a post saying to delete gnupg the do: pacman-key --init && pacman-key --populate archlinux

<jeromelanteri>	i have problem for use two different graphic cards: 1 intel from port 0:2:0 display controleur xeon e3-1200 v3/4th gen, and 1 on port 2:0:0 nvidia gtx750.
<danavu>	i'm trying to boot new lvm install with grub, /boot is outside lvm, after choosing arch in grub, it loads [something], but then fails to find my root partition by uuid
<jeromelanteri>	i can use the gtx750 or the intel one. but for do it, i need to tell the bios to boot with first cnnection on mother board one (intel) or pci one (nvidia)
<tomty89>	danavu: lvm2 hook
<jushur>	danavu: /etc/mkinitcpio.conf added lvm2 to hooks ?
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: i think it depends on your mobo
<allonsy>	danavu: don't forget to rerun mkinitcpio -p linux
<jeromelanteri>	tomty89: for my old problem (authentication asked without password ability) i find the solution. it was to add my user name to "wheel" group. and then, i have a combobox ask wich user to log with full power ability...
<tomty89>	ugh
<jeromelanteri>	my mother board is asrock z97 extrem 6
<jeromelanteri>	then, i have many little problems with this mobo
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: i wondered if you have change some polkit rule of udisk2 btw, but it doesn't matter to you now :p
<jeromelanteri>	tomty89: yes, in fact, i understand waht polkit do... and sure, if he no have a list of user in the wheel group, it serve nothing.
<jeromelanteri>	and the way to not use polkit seems to go opposit side of archlinux way of doing things... so ok.
<tomty89>	idk. iirc wheel group or not doesn't matter
<jeromelanteri>	for my mobo: first, the asmedia chipset (for sata3 added ports)...  if i tell the bios to enable it, i can use the mobo sound without any problem, but can not boot from usb key.
<jeromelanteri>	then for the problem of graphic cards, i can not understand what's happen really.
<jeromelanteri>	i install the xf86-video-intel and mesa-libgl...
<jeromelanteri>	i define config file for xorg for this device drivers and port (so nvidia works fine)
<jeromelanteri>	but can not be able to make them working fine together.
<jeromelanteri>	also, on the intel one, hdmi port is not detected if i not tell the bios to boot first on it.
<jeromelanteri>	but on lspci, it can see the grphic card and right port too...
<jeromelanteri>	strange... how is it possible ?
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: i can't use both intel and nvidia with my asus mobo as well
<jushur>	jeromelanteri: do you use the nvidia driver? (binary)
<jeromelanteri>	if i try to install lib32-mesa-libgl i can not, because of conflict with lib32-nvidia-libgl too...
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: although there seems to be some special mode a bit like optimus
<jeromelanteri>	i use nvidia-340xx
<jeromelanteri>	what is optimus ?
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: never tried it. i just use nvidia (or switch to intel in bios under certain case)
<jushur>	you "can" use both, but one of them you will have to forefeit 3d accel on. and its higly adviced to use only the opensource driver if doing so.
<jushur>	just connect your other monitor to the nvidia card also?
<jeromelanteri>	i think i used it because of vmware... i'm not sure (my memory failed)
<tomty89>	i think there is probably an option allow you to pick which gfx to use in bios
<jeromelanteri>	jushur: that i need to do yes. before i was on dvi, but now change to dp, and then i hace the default monitor on hdmi (then i would like the dp one default)
<jushur>	its only wich card the bios choses to boot from realy, can still use any of them after boot
<tomty89>	not any of them...?
<jeromelanteri>	jushur: normally, it is that i undersatnd too... but the one you choose on boot is the one show the datas boot. right ?
<jeromelanteri>	in fact, my lspci command show me them together (intel or nvidia booted first is same)
<jeromelanteri>	but the fact is that on hdmi port of intel, the result is different from boot choosed.
<tomty89>	i never seen boot order for display card though
<tomty89>	only preference order
<jeromelanteri>	tomty89: maybe it is a preference order...
<jeromelanteri>	(bad communication: my fault to be not so clear)
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: you mean you only see terminal on the intel hdmi port anyway?
<jushur>	jeromelanteri: maybe ask #intel-gfx about the intel card and how it handles boot and ports
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: it's a desktop pc, not a laptop, right?
<jeromelanteri>	tomty89: no, i see terminal on the intel hdmi if i choose intel first preference at boot. if i choose pci, i see it on nvidia.
<tomty89>	that sound correct
<tomty89>	so the bios part is alright
<jeromelanteri>	but when i boot on pci, after that, i can not see the hdmi port on intel. if i connact video on it, wrandr never see it.
<jeromelanteri>	xrandr
<tomty89>	i think that's normal
<jeromelanteri>	it is a pc desktop right.
<jeromelanteri>	tomty89: why ?
<tomty89>	because that means the mobo will disable intel
<tomty89>	my asus mobo do the same thing
<jushur>	jeromelanteri: you will not get console on the intel card if you chosen to boot from the nvidia one. especially not if you run the nvidia binary driver
<tomty89>	not sure if other mobo does, but since asrock and asus are one big family, so....
<jeromelanteri>	jushur: you mean: the irc channel of intel-gfx ?
<jushur>	jeromelanteri: and as far i know you will not get x either, as it cant load due to missing ubnderlying support. as you have nvidia blocking that
<jushur>	jeromelanteri: yes
<tomty89>	but this has been a general rule i think?
<tomty89>	you use dedicated, internal would be disabled
<jeromelanteri>	tomty89: but, if my intel is disable, normally, my lspci could not see it ? so... it see it.
<tomty89>	even since gma era
<jushur>	actually not disabled, just ignored
<tomty89>	i don't see it in my lspci though
<jushur>	ive used my intel gfx to decode movies, even tho i did not actually use the monitor on it
<jeromelanteri>	so it is not disabled for me, because i see it on lspci...
<tomty89>	you mean on windows?
<tomty89>	how do you use it to decode movies?
<jushur>	tomty89: me? no, in linux
<jeromelanteri>	same, how do you use it for decode ?
<tomty89>	not that i'd care, but curious
<jeromelanteri>	jushur: if i can use it for do something, for me... i think i would be happy. the fact is there is something serve nothing make me sade...
<jushur>	jeromelanteri: as you use the nvidia binary that wont work, atleast not my aproach to it. as it req one to run open source drivers only.
<tomty89>	igpu multi-monitor [disabled]
<tomty89>	allows you to enable the igpu multi-monitor. for lucidlogix virtu mvp function
<tomty89>	support, set this item to [enabled] to empower both integrated and discrete graphics.
<tomty89>	the igpu shared system memory size will be fixed at 64mb.
<tomty89>	configuration options: [disabled] [enabled]
<tomty89>	this is what i have in my mobo
<jeromelanteri>	jushur: ok, i will try it.
<tomty89>	but i never bother to use it, because that still defaults to intel
<jeromelanteri>	and then after, do you have a link toalk about what you do (i'm really intersted to use this card for do something)
<tomty89>	probably can only offload to nvidia with certain method at best
<tomty89>	jushur: so can you use ports of both internal and nvidia?
<jeromelanteri>	so the open source driver is: nvidia-lts ? nvidia-utils, ? nvidia-libgl ?
<tomty89>	no
<jeromelanteri>	wich one is ?
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: xf86-video-nouveau
<jeromelanteri>	for nvidia ?
<tomty89>	using it with 750ti could be a hassle btw
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: yes
<tomty89>	!g nvidia nouveau
<phrik>	tomty89: nouveau: <http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/>
<jeromelanteri>	ok... and works fine with vmware ?
<tomty89>	wat
<tomty89>	what does it have to do with vmware
<jeromelanteri>	vmware use the graphic card for adapt screen dimension and share it... right ?
<jeromelanteri>	virtualize on it in fact...
<jeromelanteri>	(sorry, my english vocabulary is poor)
<strayarch>	nouveau ~ nvidia ~satan
<tomty89>	well only if you use something like pci-passthrough
<tomty89>	iommu, vt-d, you know
<jeromelanteri>	staryarch: what do you mean ?
<tomty89>	intel is the arch demon
<jeromelanteri>	tomty89: no, i don't know all of that.
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: then you probably install none to your vmware guest
<strayarch>	i was joking, saying there is an equivalence relation between the three. graphics drivers just give me hell sometimes.
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: but the vmware specifc ddx
<tomty89>	if using the fallback of (modesetting?)? i don't know
<tomty89>	*or
<jeromelanteri>	hmmm... all of this is not really clear for me. i read somme around that, but more i read more confused for me.
<jushur>	jeromelanteri: you could technicaly run your system on the intel card, and have the nvidia card be used inside the vmware only. and get 100% accel inside the vmware from it.
<jeromelanteri>	do you have a good link who explain this in details ?
<jeromelanteri>	jushur: it could be very funny to do that !
<tomty89>	and that requires vt-d
<strayarch>	jeromelanteri, nvidia is for the newest graphics, nvidia-lts is for linux-lts (a backup kernel)
<tomty89>	or amd equivalent
<tomty89>	and maybe even a custom built kernel
<jeromelanteri>	vt-d is an option i see in my bios (and i enable it)
<jeromelanteri>	tomty89: custom build kernel (i'm afraid)
<tomty89>	well, maybe
<jushur>	yes idd, basicly everything will be custom ;)
<jeromelanteri>	staryarch: if i well understand, i need to use "nouveau" driver...
<tomty89>	but pci-passthrough is probably a nice thing to play when you have two gfx devices
<strayarch>	jeromelanteri, most likely, i think it's for post 09 or so
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: you need to extract some firmware first
<jushur>	jeromelanteri: no, if you go with your linux system on the intel card, and let nvidia be only vmware vm, then you dont install anny driver in linux for it.
<jeromelanteri>	jushur: so for use nvidia only on vmware: no driver (it is the vmware who talk directly with it by the os ?
<jushur>	jeromelanteri: question is what are you running inside the vmware vm? do you actually benefit from such setup?
<jeromelanteri>	by the os running througt vmware...
<tomty89>	btw, even if passthroughed the nvidia card to vmware, you'll still need to have two physical connection to your monitor(s)
<tomty89>	one from nvidia, one from intel
<jeromelanteri>	jushur: windows 7, kali (debian in fact)
<tomty89>	one monitor might be fine though, but you need to switch input source :)
<jeromelanteri>	tomty89: yes, sure...
<jeromelanteri>	tomty89: the solution could be to connect the same monitor by two wire: one on dvi, one on diplayport (and change source)... right ?
<tomty89>	i think so
<jeromelanteri>	same for the hmdi: two cable on different sources.
<jeromelanteri>	very good idea.
<tomty89>	heh, i'd say only a bit better than dual boot
<strayarch>	i fancy remoting in
<jeromelanteri>	so for intel... wich driver you think could be fine ? xf86-video-intel ? or "nouveau" ?
<tomty89>	strayarch: then you need two machines
<tomty89>	you don't think
<tomty89>	intel for intel, nouveau for nvidia
<strayarch>	tomty89, true. it depends on your end goal
<jeromelanteri>	tomty89: i think you joke... lol
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: you can possibly have both though
<tomty89>	*installed
<strayarch>	nooooo
<strayarch>	nooo
<strayarch>	i mean yea
<tomty89>	whether there's conflict?
<tomty89>	!tias
<phrik>	try it and see™
<strayarch>	but, ive breaken things. stick with one graphics driver
<strayarch>	also, make sure you select the correct one when installing new packages. i know mesa and nvidia conflict (nouveau probably too)
<tomty89>	well
<tomty89>	you can only have only one -libgl package
<jeromelanteri>	ok... and for intel, "nouveau" driver do the job or better use xf86-intel-video ?
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: i was not joking
<jeromelanteri>	(i cry)
<tomty89>	there's no comparison
<jeromelanteri>	sorry: i'm crying)
<tomty89>	you can install both and see how it goes though
<tomty89>	nvidia kernel module would blacklist nouveau module, so conflict with xf86-video-nouveau
<strayarch>	nvidia works well, use it. beware, some updates will break. so you'll need to downgrade occassionally.
<tomty89>	*kernel module
<jeromelanteri>	tomty89: but... for use with vmware only (for exemple), i no need driver....; so no need kernel module too... or not ?
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: you better start preparing yourself on how to deal with the firmware thing if you want to use nouveau
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: so you are sure you want to passthrough nvidia to vmware?
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: then make everything intel on your host then
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: i can't teach you how to passthrough step by step, especially not vmware, maybe someone else can though
<jeromelanteri>	tomty89: i think it is a good idea because software on linux no need to much graphic cards specificities... then autocad need it (for exemple).
<tomty89>	for me it sounds pretty crazy
<tomty89>	running vmware on arch is already a hassle
<tomty89>	and then pci-passthrough?
<jeromelanteri>	wich vm could you use ?
<strayarch>	virtualbox has an experimental feature
<jeromelanteri>	i try some other, but this vmware is the one give me more best result.
<tomty89>	but virtualbox doesn't do passthrough
<tomty89>	probably qemu with kvm only
<jeromelanteri>	especially for the monitor use
<strayarch>	ahhh
<jeromelanteri>	(also for his tools ability...)
<tomty89>	i never successfully did pci-passthrough, not to mention a vga one, so everything is theoretical to me :)
<strayarch>	i would totally just use a second machine...
<tomty89>	(well i kind of passthrough a tv card or something, but it didn't work well)
<tomty89>	strayarch: agreed
<strayarch>	graphics are designed around individual users. vm's are designed for servers and clean testing environments
<jeromelanteri>	two machins need more money... more place... more, more end more. (i'm crying)
<tomty89>	shrug why bother to use linux :p
<tomty89>	actually using linux in a vm might be a better choice for you
<tomty89>	if you won't feel guilty for that
<jeromelanteri>	is it also possible to use a vm at boot time directly, and then choose wich os to use from it ?
<tomty89>	what?
<tomty89>	you mean dual boot?
<aeon-ltd>	why?
<tomty89>	do you know what's a vm?
<jeromelanteri>	not dual boot: vm boot...
<aeon-ltd>	you mean converting a vm to a usable install on the hdd?
<jeromelanteri>	looks like the vm boot and let you virtualize which os you want.
<jeromelanteri>	yes
<strayarch>	*clearing the air* what is the end goal?
<tomty89>	what? in grub you pick vm ware and it start a pure vmware?
<jeromelanteri>	yes
<tomty89>	vmware os?
<jeromelanteri>	looks like...
<tomty89>	...
<jeromelanteri>	possible or not ?
<jeromelanteri>	if possible, it could be a solution...
<strayarch>	a solution to.....
<tomty89>	qemu+btrfs-subvol next-gen virtualization?
<aeon-ltd>	an os that is only a hyervisor has it's uses, but sounds kinda limiting to the average home user
<jeromelanteri>	what ?
<tomty89>	(windows is excluded though)
<tomty89>	(coz there's no way it supports btrfs, or even zfs)
<tomty89>	aeon-ltd: i think for him the only difference might be harddisk allocation
<tomty89>	well, that's the only one i can think of
<tomty89>	maybe i'm just stupid
<strayarch>	chroot?
<jeromelanteri>	no one can said it can not be sometimes stupid :) so i'm too (and much more: i lake of knows)
<tomty89>	windows chroot? d:
<strayarch>	ew
<tomty89>	wxc?
<strayarch>	ditch windows
<strayarch>	toss out the window
<tomty89>	systemd-wspawn
<jeromelanteri>	autocad on linux ...
<jeromelanteri>	photoshop on linux...
<tomty89>	eww photoshop
<jeromelanteri>	so if that is: bye bye windows for ever !
<strayarch>	gimp and latex win
<tomty89>	can we use blender for cad? lol
<jeromelanteri>	strayarch: you joke ?
<strayarch>	nah, gimp doesn't support vector
<tomty89>	inkscape <3
<jeromelanteri>	if you have a lot of time, blender is good...
<strayarch>	tomty89, learning curves
<jeromelanteri>	"smoke" video on linux...
<tomty89>	i don't think it has a very steep one, but its ui is kind of...
<tomty89>	but it improved a bit i think
<strayarch>	jeromelanteri, i would say linux on a vm with windows actually installed
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: why do you want linux btw
<jeromelanteri>	(staryarch: no way... i really don't like windows
<strayarch>	+ dual boot
<tomty89>	oh so the linux-vm-on-windows-syndrome
<tomty89>	*guilty-syndrome
<jeromelanteri>	tomty89: i develop an application who use specificities of linux fs
<tomty89>	that probably make sense
<strayarch>	sometimes
<jeromelanteri>	and then, i like linux too.. i prefer from far to windows. but the fact is that i need to use autocad sometimes and i use a lot of photoshop too.
<jeromelanteri>	i'm tired many times with windows way of thinking around configiration (who is not logic in my mind)
<strayarch>	is it not possible to *freeze* a system?
<tomty89>	let's hope one day mono would be the solution
<jeromelanteri>	i think about a futur where ther could have a "looks like" virtual machine running only applications embeded in just what need for make them running well...
<strayarch>	technically,
<tomty89>	i think many vm on linux can do windows pretty good already
<tomty89>	just not the gfx part
<thedudez0r>	tbh bhyve in freebsd looks promising
<thedudez0r>	they've stated that there are plans to support windows. linux support is already there but needs polishing i think
<strayarch>	i think you could install linux and use the onboard graphics, which suck, and then use a vm for windows which uses the graphics. i guess this depends on how many moniter outputs. you would also need to do some fancy key mapping
<jeromelanteri>	for me, running windows from vmware is safe for internet connection and stability, also, it is heavy and goes slower than run it from dual boot (for sure), but... ok... if i can use it with graphic card directly like that, it could bne a good choice for me.
<thedudez0r>	the thing with bhyve is that it's a hypervisor rather than a vm running on top of the host os
<strayarch>	honestly dualboot
<jeromelanteri>	strayarch: i think i have to connect two cables on principal monitor: one dvi for linux, one diplayport for windows (dvi on intel card, dp on nvidia card)
<strayarch>	or two machines
<jeromelanteri>	then, two hdmi on second monitor (hdmi1 and hdmi2 source)
<tomty89>	i just won't use vmware for that case
<strayarch>	jeromelanteri, it should be possible. make sure you script your setup to save time down the road.
<tom^>	vga passthrough?
<tomty89>	because you no longer want any resize magic on that case
<tom^>	heh it has its heap of issues and requirements too
<jeromelanteri>	then, boot on linux and intel card, when open vmware with windows, swith the source entry...
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: oh we forget keyboard and mouse
<jeromelanteri>	wtf...
<strayarch>	laptop and remotein in. that was my solution
<strayarch>	haha, remotein is my script to do so
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: maybe you can get in and out though, no idea
<jeromelanteri>	wy the keyboard and mouse would not be share ? there are on usb port...
<tomty89>	strayarch: i used remote windows as a solution in work
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: i just don't know how you release and capture when it's kind of "headless"
<tomty89>	maybe there's a way
<jeromelanteri>	i don' treally know. i need more knowledge for be able to really know that. so...
<jeromelanteri>	you gave me many good ideas... i need time nox for search how to do it well.
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: absolutely, there's tons of experiment ahead
<tomty89>	it's definitely not for the faint-hearted
<jeromelanteri>	ok thanks all your guys,
<jeromelanteri>	i go search solutions... have a good day.
<strayarch>	you too
<jeromelanteri>	i will tell you my finds
<sudokode>	tom
<jcaesar>	say, if i add xynes repo, i.e. https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/unofficial_user_repositories#xyne-x86_64 then i shouldn't have to do any fiddling with keys, right?
<phrik>	title: unofficial user repositories - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<jushur>	jcaesar: key-id: not required, as maintainer is a tu
<jcaesar>	i have no idea what tu means, but i assume it implies that his key is included in the pacman key database.
<jcaesar>	still, if i install pacserve: file /var/cache/pacman/pkg/pacserve-2015-1-any.pkg.tar.xz is corrupted (invalid or corrupted package (pgp signature)).
<dacoit>	trusted user
<jcaesar>	ic
<dacoit>	and your understanding is correct, already in your keyring
<jushur>	redownload the file?
<jcaesar>	jushur: multiple times.
<jcaesar>	xyne's  key c2e5c0d2 seems to be in the list.
<jcaesar>	hm, 8f173680 is also there. should there be more?
<dacoit>	what siglevel is specified in your pacman.conf
<jcaesar>	required
<dacoit>	that might be a problem with that package then. any other xyne package installs fine, im guessing? just to test

<devgrohl>	which email server would be a good choice?
<dacoit>	dovecot maybe. its all a bit too much for the likes of me.

<aremis117>	diegoviola:  team rocket blasting off again~~~
<diegoviola>	aremis117: what?
<diegoviola>	gnome is pretty but i have to remap shortcuts and install extensions to make it usable, it does get in the way a lot though
<aremis117>	mate is better :v
<openfbtd>	tiling_wm_master_race.webm
<aremis117>	openfbtd:  render_apps_in_cli.webm
<aremis117>	i guess he rode that horse too hard eh?
<coolthingy500>	just use something that doesn't break with every update.
<aremis117>	mate, awesome, gnome, kde, jwm, pekwm, ede, e17
<gnea>	only 8? that barely scratches the surface.
<coolthingy500>	well. something that the devs are not full of themselves to not listen to feedback.
<aremis117>	oh no i think i've fiddled with 22 de's wm's, and cli render tools
<gnea>	oh okay
<gnea>	i mean, i tried a lot of them too over the years, i finally decided on e19
<gnea>	of course, if there was sarcasm on your end, i probably did a poor job of detecting it
<coolthingy500>	i got terminology from e17
<gnea>	i tried terminology. it's okay. i'll stick with rxvt-unicode.
<coolthingy500>	though i'm looking for a de that's qt since gtk3 is just a pain to fix.
<sudokode>	kde and...
<sudokode>	isn't lxde moving towards qt?
<sudokode>	lxqt or whatever
<coolthingy500>	it is.
<aremis117>	it'll at least be better
<coolthingy500>	lxqt is still experimental, and kde is still going through with the plasma 5 change.
<coolthingy500>	so i got to wait, and to get a machine that can handle kde better.
<aremis117>	kde is way too fat for me.  i'll use it when i just want something pretty but ugh, the framerate with games is always terrible on my laptop @~@
<sudokode>	i tried kde not too long ago. it's way different from the kde 3.5 i'm used to
<sudokode>	after 3.5, i switched to xfce, then got an lcd monitor and moved to tiling
<coolthingy500>	i'm on xfce. love it.
<gnea>	they're great for applications, but for a de, no thanks
<sudokode>	des are essentially pointless
<dacoit>	like life
<coolthingy500>	so best thing is to head into the wm world.
<gnea>	and ac units in the middle of winter
<gnea>	wm was actually one of my favorite wm's
<aremis117>	i like awesome, openbox, and pek
<sudokode>	i'm stuck on i3
<aremis117>	blakcbox and ratpoison are kinda wierd
<aremis117>	i can't get on i3
<sudokode>	til someone convinces me otherwise
<diegoviola>	i like the look of gnome but i can't use it
<gnea>	openbox and blackbox were nice
<aremis117>	i just don't like it o~o
<diegoviola>	it gets in the way a lot
<diegoviola>	suggestions?
<coolthingy500>	i like openbox. simple to learn to set up.
<sudokode>	i've never used enlightenment
<albertocg>	i3 is easy to use too
<diegoviola>	e is nice, but too much bling
<aremis117>	gnome is nice to look at, it's just when you have to use it you want to stab yourself.  as quoted by a friends who is an absolute linux noob and was just fiddling around one day.
<sudokode>	that trend is likely to continue
<diegoviola>	aremis117: that's how i feel about gnome exactly
<coolthingy500>	fedora with gnome kinda makes sense. but then so does drinking bleach.
<gnea>	if you don't look at the wm/de codewise, then you'll keep focused on the bling
<aremis117>	only good thing in e is the fact that fish is pack'd with it
<gnea>	and that, to me, is the tragedy that befalls many newer linux users
<diegoviola>	xfce is ugly to look at but it's at least usable compared to gnome
<aremis117>	diegoviola:  my bud only uses ubuntu to play league and write papers :p
<sudokode>	coolthingy500: that's either a terrible analogy or a sad story
<diegoviola>	aremis117: lol
<coolthingy500>	it's both. but ya it sucks.
<gnea>	my desktop has hardly any bling enabled
<jupelius>	i don't really see how drinking bleach makes sense
<sudokode>	i've actually drunk bleach
<albertocg>	i run gnome-shell on tty1 and i3 on tty2. whenever i need some user friendly interface or handle many floating windows i just switch to tty1
<sudokode>	so i can't exactly say much
<diegoviola>	gnea: what do you use?
<gnea>	the seconds on the digital clock move nice
<gnea>	diegoviola: e19
<jupelius>	sudokode: did you do it on purpose?
<albertocg>	diegoviola: why do you say gnome isn't usable?
<gnea>	it's the latest version of enlightenment
<diegoviola>	gnea: screenshot?
<coolthingy500>	how are you alive?
<sudokode>	jupelius: well no, but i learned why you're not supposed to siphon things you wouldn't swallow
<caspivey>	greetings
<diegoviola>	albertocg: i don't say it's not usable, i just say that it gets in the way a lot for me
<jupelius>	sudokode: i see
<aremis117>	gnea:  i demand a screenshot young wo/man
<diegoviola>	albertocg: i really want to like it
<gnea>	aremis117: 'man'
<sudokode>	half a mouthful of 15% sodium hypochlorite does not agree with the stomach
<jupelius>	word i learned today: siphon (this an important one)
<caspivey>	does anyone know a fast way to force a gateway add when it doesnt think its reachable?
<aremis117>	s/boobs/kak
<sudokode>	very important
<gnea>	give me a moment, please
<diegoviola>	how do i restore the keyboard shortcuts in gnome to the default settings?
<diegoviola>	to default values
<albertocg>	diegoviola: i still don't get your problem
<coolthingy500>	brb
<aremis117>	diegoviola:  go to general settings menu and it'll be in there..... smewhere
<danthebeastman>	trying to build pacaur.. cower is giving me this error  cower-12.tar.gz ... failed (unknown public key 1eb2638ff56c0c53) what did i forget to do?
<dacoit>	whoa. red
<diegoviola>	aremis117: i already looked, it's not there
<aremis117>	ok one thing good in gnome:  it has it's menus straight.  fucking kde is a mess
<danthebeastman>	i get this from running makepkg -si
<danthebeastman>	dacoit: control codes
<albertocg>	with dconf-editor you can set keybindings to default on gnome
<dacoit>	!echo too leet for dacoit | rainbow
<phrik>	too leet for dacoit
<aremis117>	danthebeastman:  are you downloading packs from the aur manually?
<danthebeastman>	aremis117: yeah
<danthebeastman>	i downloaded the tar, extracted, then tried to makepkg, but then that error
<albertocg>	didn't work with an aur manager?
<danthebeastman>	i'm trying to install pacaur
<coolthingy500>	you mighy have some dependences you need to install before you can install that pkg build
<coolthingy500>	what's the dependencies you need for pacaur
<coolthingy500>	?
<danthebeastman>	yeah pacaur depends on cower, which is what i'm trying to build
<danthebeastman>	i don't understand why it's talking about pgp keys failing
<seylerius>	danthebeastman: gpg --recv-keys <fingerprint> followed by gpg --lsign-key <fingerprint>
<seylerius>	it's looking at your local keyring, not the pacman keyring.
<gnea>	aremis117: http://i.imgur.com/1plm1u1.jpg
<danthebeastman>	i have to do that for every aur package?
<seylerius>	no, only the ones that need gpg keys
<caspivey>	during the install process is there anywhere i can manually add the gateway without running ip route add
<danthebeastman>	ahha! thank you seylerius
<mitch0>	you can include the pacman keyre
<mitch0>	keyring, too
<gnea>	diegoviola: ^^
<dacoit>	danthebeastman: you downloaded the source code, download the pkgbuild / associated tarball
<diegoviola>	gnea: cool
<diegoviola>	gnea: y u no use terminology?
<mar77i>	word porn... so hot right now.
<dacoit>	you following me? cower-12.tar.gz is just the source, not the package
<gnea>	diegoviola: too much bling
<diegoviola>	gnea: can't you disable the bling?
<gnea>	diegoviola: urxvt just runs cleaner by default
<gnea>	plus it will display everything via utf-8 properly
<diegoviola>	i swear i'm going to kill myself if i have to export ssh_auth_sock and ssh_agent_pid once again.........

<turks>	!grab diegoviola
<phrik>	turks: tada!
<diegoviola>	what do you guys use for your ssh-agent?
<mar77i>	actually ssh-agent works great as such.
<diegoviola>	i want ssh-agent to run automatically when i boot my system and stay running (only one ssh-agent process) and then generate a key for me and keep that connection alive until i shutdown my system
<diegoviola>	but i don't want to add that to ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc
<diegoviola>	is there a way to do it with systemd or whatever?
<danthebeastman>	diegoviola: yep
<diegoviola>	how, please?
<danthebeastman>	off the top of my head, no idea, but you can google how to write systemd service files, it's fairly easy and straight-forward
<mar77i>	diegoviola: you could launch it from the .xinitrc/.xsession if you have a password for >=1 of the keys, i'd set up a series of scripts exec'ing after each other, the part with the password from a term
<mar77i>	but yeah, there's ~/.local/systemd iirc

<gogoprog1>	gnea: no problem here
<pvinis>	hello. im trying to start x and get the no screens found. i have an imac 2008 with an ati gpu. i have the open source driver installed, and kms is enabled
<gnea>	okay
<gnea>	so  http://lug.mtu.edu is probably down then
<pvinis>	any ideas on how to fix it?

<pvinis>	no
<pvinis>	how do i do that?
<pvinis>	oh
<pvinis>	it worked

<phrik>	title: xorg - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<gnea>	pvinis: okay
<pvinis>	thanks.. didnt know about that
<gnea>	pvinis: well, same solution :)
<jcaesar>	say, is there an elegant solution for the problem that you can't load modules after updating your kernel (and before rebooting)?
<sledgehammer>	no - just don't upgrade your kernel until you're ready to reboot
<jcaesar>	sledgehammer: that's not a very elegant solution…
<jcaesar>	(but who am i talking to…)
<pb>	jcaesar: i haven't found one, the old kernel is removed, and the new one installed, so there's version mismatches. you can manually insmod if you have a 3rd party module that works with that version, but ymmv.
<jcaesar>	i'd prefer a setting that automatically consideres the new modules on reboot, but i have no idea how that could look.
<pb>	jcaesar: the only way that would look is if when you upgraded your kernel, you didn't actually upgrade your kernel (but marked it for installation at system shutdown, or, during the bootup process which would trigger another reboot to load it afterwards)
<jcaesar>	actually, shutdown is probably the better option. you don't want that installation to fail halfway through at boot-up.
<pb>	both of those solutions are kinda lame - the upgrade-at-shutdown could cause issues, rendering the system unbootable (this is the kernel, after all) if something goes awry, or if somebody's in a hurry and just wants it shut down immediately. it also would require a proper shutdown, which doesn't always happen.
<sledgehammer>	i've used arch for over 10 years and this has never been an issue for me. each to their own, i guess
<pb>	on bootup yea, it's even worse, because a failed upgrade means even less chance of it booting/coming back up, and in the case of a remote system that could be even more disasterous
<pb>	i've been a gentoo and arch user for over 10 years, and it too has been a minor annoyance only a small handfull of times
<pb>	any/all upgrades on remote systems should be planned, anyway (best practices), and some packages (like kernel, glibc, etc) require appropriate system reboots. so, don't upgrade those packages if you can't perform one.
<pb>	desktop systems, well, i'm a bit more lax, because i can reboot them at will i guess. so yea, like sledgehammer said, many years, few problems with it, but teho.
<openfbtd>	if you are doing an upgrade on shutdown thing, you can set it up to put the old kernel away, not remove it
<openfbtd>	the way i do my manual upgrades is i have two kernels in /boot at any given time
<pb>	openfbtd: yes, but in the event the new one fails to boot, few systems have the ability to autofallback to the last working kernel, so manual intervention is still required. all in all, we've changed nothing, the system is still hung at boot. easier to recover, yes, but still hung at boot.
<openfbtd>	yes. i only ever consider arch on desktops, not in prod, so you're probably around when the machine is rebooting.
<jcaesar>	hm, so how do you guys update remote systems? automatically?
<openfbtd>	and if you're using arch on a server farm... eeeeh.
<pb>	openess: i love arch in kvm guests on a server farm. i also run gentoo on servers in data centers.
<openfbtd>	a solution requiring a manual intervention is a better one than no solution though.
<sudokode>	pb: so manual intervention is already your specialty
<pb>	openfbtd: "no solution" and "upgrade when you can attend a reboot and be prepared for it" aren't the same thing :-)
<openfbtd>	fair enough.
<jcaesar>	this problem just bit me a bit, because i am screwing around. i just created a vm and used the kernel and initrd from the host system to boot it.
<jcaesar>	maybe i should stop screwing around. ;)
<openfbtd>	also “test the upgrade on a few machines, don't upgrade everything at the same time :d”
<pb>	i don't like the idea of a system putting itself into a state where manual intervention is required unless i fsck up. so i don't upgrade components of the system that require a reboot until i am free to do so, with a remote console, or in person if required. and of course i test the upgrade on a few machines, and don't do an all at once rollout. and of course, standardized hardware (which is why i love kvm guests running arch).
<jupelius>	how do you do those tests exactly?
<jackdaniel>	pacman -syu --noconfirm && systemctl reboot # if it gets up, it's fine? :p
<holomorph>	!look
<phrik>	ಠ_ಠ
<pb>	on guest kvms, just spin up a new instance (clone of prod stack), and yea, litereally pacman -syu
<pb>	validate it installed properly, reboot it, watch it come up on the vnc console through the host
<pb>	make sure services work and stuff, standard qa procedures
<pb>	if it fails, figure out why, if it rebooted and came up with everything working, throw it on a few prod nodes, watch the logs for a bit, check for errors... if anything appears incompatible, remove from the load balancer, investigate the service anomaly, but rarely gets to that point. staged rollout of the rest, so the stack isn't all rebooting at once and services are continually available
<pb>	for the hosts, it's a bit less straight forward, because you have to upgrade the guests, migrate them to another host, and then bring the host down for an upgrade, and migrate them back
<pb>	but my hosts don't run arch, so meh :-)
<jeromelanteri>	how to easy disable startx on boot ?

<jupelius>	where do you run it from?
<jeromelanteri>	from home
<jeromelanteri>	lol
<jupelius>	no i mean the startx
<jeromelanteri>	at boot time
<jeromelanteri>	i think user level 5 or something like that (not sure of what's happen)
<jeromelanteri>	i boot on grub, grub send the stratx on login sddm
<jupelius>	!bail
<phrik>	looks like jupelius is bailing out on this one - good luck!
<jeromelanteri>	what is bailing out ?
<bakednotfried>	jeromelanteri it means you're gonna have to install another distro
<jeromelanteri>	why are you so close mind ?
<jeromelanteri>	i just ask some help... please, be tolerent a little bit
<wasamasa>	lol
<jeromelanteri>	lol
<wasamasa>	it is a pretty fine choice to not want to help you out
<wasamasa>	in fact, at least 6 billion people do
<wasamasa>	be grateful when someone decides to help you instead
<jeromelanteri>	why ? i help many peoples too when ask some newbies question around qt or c++, every body could be a newbie...
<sledgehammer>	everynody could read documentation too - but they don't
<wasamasa>	!bail
<jeromelanteri>	why some peoples just push you out ? looks like they are god.
<phrik>	looks like wasamasa is bailing out on this one - good luck!
<jeromelanteri>	i read some, but it is not clear for me. i go on wiki
<jeromelanteri>	i think it's looks like too complicate, because if so simple, just answer and help for really...
<wolter>	if my computer is a cups client, i shouldn't need to install any printer drivers right?
<jeromelanteri>	no one want to just help ?
<wolter>	(since they're supposed to be in the server, and the server is my interface)
<jeromelanteri>	wolter: you should
<sledgehammer>	jeromelanteri, i just joined, so ask your question again, just in case it was a good one
<wolter>	jeromelanteri: how come? i am trying to use a cannon ip1800 that is hosted on my home server but i can't print because apparently i am missing some file
<jeromelanteri>	thanks sledgehammer: i just need to boot without startx automatcily (for make some test of xorg config and drivers)
<sledgehammer>	jeromelanteri, so just undo whatever you did that runs startx automatically
<jeromelanteri>	wolter: you have to find a driver for your printer that your arch can use (or go by lib32 compatibility), then, choose a protocol to speack with: lpp maybe...) then just config the cups by the web interface
<wolter>	jeromelanteri: have you tried disabling gdm?
<jeromelanteri>	sledgehammer: i not remember all that i done... so, i remember i install sddm for login, but i not remember how this happens to boot startx at boot time
<jeromelanteri>	wolter: i'm not with gdm, but with sddm
<jeromelanteri>	you think just systemctl disable sddm would be sufficient ?
<sledgehammer>	!tias
<phrik>	try it and see™
<qubitnerd>	!tias
<phrik>	try it and see™
<sledgehammer>	:)
<qubitnerd>	he he
<jeromelanteri>	yeah ok, but before try and fall down with a black screen i would like to be sure...
<sledgehammer>	jeromelanteri, if you're not prepared to try things out for yourself, you really should reconsider your choice of distro
<qubitnerd>	well wernt you afraid of falling with a black screen when you enabled sddm ?
<jeromelanteri>	ok, i thank about the great community of sympathic peoples where were a force... not a selection.
<jeromelanteri>	no, i'm afraid about loose many times because i change some xorg config files for try something.
<jeromelanteri>	and i just want to be sure to boot on terminal and not on startx
<selby>	i just spent the last 6 hours writing bash
<selby>	i deserve a reward
<wolter>	jeromelanteri: did you configure your setup?
<sledgehammer>	jeromelanteri, and again - if tinkering makes you afraid, you are definitely in the wrong place
<jeromelanteri>	wolter: not all
<wolter>	jeromelanteri: there are only so many ways to have startx autostart on boot
<qubitnerd>	selby: now spend the next six hours bashing write
<sledgehammer>	wolter, he's not even using startx. hes using sddm
<selby>	qubitnerd: kwrite is kinda a peice of shit
<wolter>	sledgehammer: aren't they non exclussive?
<wolter>	jeromelanteri: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php?title=start_x_at_login&redirect=no
<phrik>	title: start x at login - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<sledgehammer>	wolter, what? read his posts again
<jeromelanteri>	sledgehammer: i'm french, maybe my words are bad choice for precise explain. so ok... i not ask for a leçon of morality, but for an help. if just boot on terminal is to strong for you and you don't know same me how to do really, just tell it clearly, it is not an obligation to bailling out (humility is a nice word)
<sledgehammer>	there's french arch support available, that might suit you better
<wolter>	sledgehammer: why read his posts again? i am showing him the ways that people make startx launch automatically so he knows better how to turn it off.
<jeromelanteri>	yes, it is the wiki i read... for me it is really confused
<wolter>	jeromelanteri: there is a french version of that page, did it help any better?
<jeromelanteri>	i go to read it. thanks wolter.
<jeromelanteri>	do you want we try to resolve your problem together ?
<wolter>	jeromelanteri: the printer problem?
<jeromelanteri>	yes
<jeromelanteri>	(the other oen are to big head and don't want to help, but think about selection peoples...)
<wolter>	jeromelanteri: sure :) i could use some help!

<jeromelanteri>	ok, what's your printer ?
<selby>	my life
<wolter>	jeromelanteri: do you understand spanish better? i have a cannon ip1800
<wolter>	but i thought i wouldn't need to install drivers since it is connected to another computer in the network
<jeromelanteri>	no spanish bad more... sorry. ok, let me just have a look around this ip1800
<jeromelanteri>	wolter: ok, so you can share it
<jeromelanteri>	wich os is connect on the other computer ?
<jeromelanteri>	windows or linux or bsd ?
<wolter>	jeromelanteri: exactly; the other computer has ubuntu server os, 14.04 i think
<jeromelanteri>	ok... waiting...
<jeromelanteri>	i think you can define an ip to this printer to speak with by cups
<jeromelanteri>	or maybe also a class
<jeromelanteri>	i read this now: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/cups_printer_sharing
<phrik>	title: cups printer sharing - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<wolter>	jeromelanteri: and it has cups, of course, and the drivers installed. in fact, i have printed through it before. i recently installed arch linux, previously i used ubuntu. from ubuntu i could print without problems. from arch, i get an error about a missing file. let me see if i can reproduce (i uninstalled cups some hours ago)
<wolter>	(the server computer has cups and the drivers)
<jeromelanteri>	wolter: could you just copy/paste your cups ubuntu config file to the arch disto ?
<jeromelanteri>	it should works
<jeromelanteri>	also, you have to add your username account to the wheel group for polkit pass
<jeromelanteri>	(i had problem around that before and cups was looks like closed)
<jeromelanteri>	i think communicate by lpd or ipp could be the solution
<wolter>	jeromelanteri: my user is in wheel
<wolter>	are those latter solutions accomplished by using cups, or something else?
<jeromelanteri>	wolter: other solutions could be to share my samba server... but share with cups is possible so...
<jeromelanteri>	wolter: what about a class ?
<wolter>	jeromelanteri: what do you mean by a class?
<jeromelanteri>	you can create a class in the cups server where your printer is
<jeromelanteri>	in your cups web interface, there is a place for create class...
<jeromelanteri>	you add the printer to the class, and then i think you can give the job to the class... who will print
<wolter>	hmm let me check on that :)
<vangap>	i can not clear cached memory with out rebooting the box, any ideas why this is? i hve killed all the java processes which were building up this cache (i think)
<vangap>	cached memory stands at 9.3 gb atm,  i hve a 16 gb ram..soon i will have to restart the box which i want to avoid if i can..
<jeromelanteri>	vangap: maybe java processes called some bad threads... or something like that.
<jeromelanteri>	wich java processes comes from ?
<namarrgon>	you mean the page cache?
<vangap>	i have logstash and elasticsearch running on a box with 16 gb ram
<jeromelanteri>	namarrgon: happy to see you. could you please tell me if there is a easy way to just not boot on startx at boot time ?
<namarrgon>	how are you starting it on boot?
<vangap>	here is the meminfo http://pastie.org/10175222
<phrik>	title: #10175222 - pastie (at pastie.org)
<vangap>	even after stopping the java processes, i can not clear the cached memory.. only rebooting helps..
<namarrgon>	why do you want to "clear" it?
<vangap>	kernel is not able to take back that memory when needed and oom killer is happening..
<vangap>	there might be some bug with the java processes i am running..but i am looking to see if i can clear that memory manually without rebooting..
<namarrgon>	you mean the page cache, right?
<namarrgon>	the "cache" column in 'free'?
<jeromelanteri>	namarron: i boot on grub... then... i don't really know (not remember)
<namarrgon>	jeromelanteri: do you use dm?
<namarrgon>	+a
<jeromelanteri>	vangap: i think these memory are linked to process who has pid maybe... kill the pid would works.
<jeromelanteri>	i use sddm yes
<jeromelanteri>	and then it open kde
<namarrgon>	disable/stop the service
<jeromelanteri>	that's all ?
<jeromelanteri>	just systemctl disble sddm would be fine ?
<namarrgon>	if that is what you use to start x, yes
<jeromelanteri>	very good. some other just have to big head here to just tell me this simply. thank you a lot namarrgon, you are the best.
<namarrgon>	did i stumble into more drama again?
<sledgehammer>	looks like it :)
<jeromelanteri>	vanggap: also, if this from elasticsearch, you just have to kill nodes...
<jeromelanteri>	stumble ? 'a new word for me)
<vangap>	namarrgon: i am not sure if its page cache or not, yes the "cached" column in free that i want to clear, which is same as cached here http://pastie.org/10175222
<phrik>	title: #10175222 - pastie (at pastie.org)
<vangap>	i stopped all those java processes, but still i couldn't clear..
<foxboron>	tried to upgrade linux and got this error during mkinitcpio: ==> error: '/lib/modules/3.19.3-3-arch' is not a valid kernel module director. is this an error on my side or arch?
<jeromelanteri>	namarrgon: no, just some people, when someone ask a newbie like question just answer to go away and change distro... and i'm really tired with this kind of close mind thinking.
<sledgehammer>	vangap, you should fix the actual problem i.e. "kernel is not able to take back that memory when needed"
<tomty89>	foxboron: your side i think
<tomty89>	we have been using 4.0.1 for a while
<foxboron>	tomty89: yeah, but it's not been a problem on my laptop. symlinking the 4.0.1 dir to the missing one "worked" (i hope)
<foxboron>	so i just find it strange
<tomty89>	`uname -r`?
<tomty89>	maybe you forgot your /boot parition somehow
<foxboron>	3.19, not rebooted yet
<tomty89>	oh right, that shouldn't be relevant, sorry
<namarrgon>	vangap: the kernel will drop cached pages when programs ask for more memory, you shouldn't worry about it
<vangap>	namarrgon: is there a way i can check that and confirm..because it seemed like it wasn't happening, there was lot of cached memory, but oom killer killed java processes..
<jeromelanteri>	vangap: http://linuxconfig.org/clear-memory-cache-on-your-linux-server
<namarrgon>	vangap: look at the dmesg output, it will tell you why it was killed
<vangap>	may be since the java processes is using those cached pages, kernel couldn't take back?
<phrik>	title: clear memory cache on your linux server (at linuxconfig.org)
<namarrgon>	vangap: no, that's not how it works
<namarrgon>	the kernel is creating the buffers and caches, you can't actively "use" them
<vangap>	jeromelanteri: i did those things, unfortunately that didn't clear
<jeromelanteri>	vangap: do you know exaclty wich app generate this loose of memory ?
<jeromelanteri>	could you vlagrind it ?
<jeromelanteri>	maybe a bugged application who not use memory well
<tomty89>	his memfree and memavailable do look a bit weird
<vangap>	jeromelanteri: i think so, it's logstash that's doing this.. i will try vlagrind and see
<jeromelanteri>	also, if you know java, you could find the problem... but sure, not so easy.
<tomty89>	foxboron: what can you see in /lib/modules/3.19.3-3-arch now
<foxboron>	tomty89: it does not exist. i just symlinked it too 4.0.1-1-arch
<tomty89>	that's not normal
<tomty89>	why you symlinked it?
<vangap>	namarrgon: is there any specific thing that i should be looking for in dmesg ? http://pastie.org/10175265 i see that kernel hit low mem mark..
<phrik>	title: #10175265 - pastie (at pastie.org)
<tomty89>	woops call trace
<namarrgon>	vangap:  total-vm:13119500kb is what it trys to use but you just don't have enough, even if you'd drop all caches
<tomty89>	foxboron: also i wonder if the symlink even points correctly
<foxboron>	tomty89: well, if i made a typo i'd notice ;p
<tomty89>	not necessarily a typo *shrug*, but it's weird anyway
<tomty89>	i can't understand you would see that message with a path anyway
<tomty89>	while i'm reading the source of mkinitcpio
<tomty89>	neither do i understand why two -d test though
<tomty89>	*twice
<tomty89>	ah seems i looked at some older version fork
<tomty89>	now this make more sense
<disappointment>	is there any alternative to gnome-calculator for kde which is at least comparable? i mean kcalc doesn't show me the history of operations and has support for far less options than gnome-calculator.
<sd1001>	though not specifically kde, but i like qalc
<disappointment>	sd1001:  i will try it out.
<sd1001>	it also has a gui frontoënd, qalculate i think
<wolter>	i use zsh and have autoload -u compinit and compinit in my .zshrc but i don't have command autocomplete, can somebody help me?
<wolter>	i have no autocomplete for pacman's options or packages
<wolter>	i can't understand why it doesn't work for me :(
<anon1337_>	hi, i'm just installing archlinux to my lenovo e545 (with mkfs.btrfs /dev/sda so the whole disk is btrfs and then i install grub as stated on the wiki), everything runs fine, no errors or anything but when i try to boot it (with legacy mode, since no efi was used during install) it just won't find the bootloader... so it's probably a bios bug, right? :/ it works normally with for example fedora in efi mode...
<namarrgon>	why are you not using uefi?
<anon1337_>	i want to use the whole disk as btrfs partion... i know i could do that, and i probably will but i wanted to try first
<namarrgon>	and how did you install grub?
<wolter>	sorry, i had to leave. can somebody help me with my zsh autocomplete problem?
<wolter>	does the arch iso use oh-my-zsh?
<namarrgon>	no, it uses the grml config
<muchweb>	wolter: i dunno. i am using oh my zsh and parameter completion works
<muchweb>	wolter: althougt i search packages with -ss, not autocompletion
<anon1337_>	"grub-install --target=i386-pc --recheck --debug /dev/sda" + "grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg" and it all went smoothly and everything was detected
<wolter>	muchweb: so you don't get autocomplete with pacman -s ?
<wolter>	namarrgon: does one have to configure the grml thing to get autocompletion just like in the live session?
<muchweb>	wolter: i have just checked and it yes, works with stock oh-my-zsh.
<namarrgon>	wolter: i don't know, try it and see
<muchweb>	wolter: i prefer not to use it because it takes about a second to complete
<wolter>	muchweb: and do you also get autocomplete in gsettings?
<muchweb>	wolter: no, not with gsettings
<wolter>	muchweb: with systemd?
<muchweb>	wolter: systemctl yes
<wolter>	ah awesome
<shadowkatstudios>	so if i'm using two 200gb drives and two 160gb drives, what raid do i want to use?
<muchweb>	shadowkatstudios: the raid size is restricted to the smallest drive in the array
<shadowkatstudios>	can i raid0ish the two 160gb drives, mirror them with the 200gb drives and raid5? the remaining space on the 200gb drives?
<shadowkatstudios>	wait, not 5
<shadowkatstudios>	i'd have to use 0 or 1 for the other ones
<jokke>	hi
<jokke>	i need to set up an ftp server (i know..) on a remote machine and i'm not able to log in
<jokke>	login shell is set to /bin/false
<jokke>	(that of the ftp user i created and whitelisted)
<wasamasa>	just use sftp
<wasamasa>	!next
<phrik>	another satisfied customer! next!
<jokke>	ssh with that user works (and get's disconnected after login as expected)
<jokke>	the vsftpd log just says the obvious: failed login..
<jokke>	i'm 100% sure i'm using the same password as with ssh
<wasamasa>	since sftp is just ftp over ssh and needs no more config than the one for ssh
<shadowkatstudios>	okay, next question, would it be a good idea to use hardware raid1 if i'm running a box with an 800mhz single core processor from 1999?
<wasamasa>	shadowkatstudios: lol
<shadowkatstudios>	'cause i have an ide raid card

<wasamasa>	jokke: isn't the "vs" in vsftpd for "very safe"?
<shadowkatstudios>	very secure
<wasamasa>	oh snap, jokke must still have me on their ignore
<jokke>	hm?
<wasamasa>	shadowkatstudios: right
<jokke>	shadowkatstudios: are you refering to the name of the daemon?
<shadowkatstudios>	apparently
<jokke>	mhm
<wasamasa>	i just find it a hilarious thing to put in the name of a ftp daemon
<shadowkatstudios>	i'm assuming it's relative
<shadowkatstudios>	better than that university one that had a major security flaw every release
<wasamasa>	it's got 13 cves, yay
<jokke>	mmh
<jokke>	ftp is crap either way
<jokke>	and should die
<shadowkatstudios>	ftp has its place
<shadowkatstudios>	it's for windows core machines where they have no way to actually download anything
<shadowkatstudios>	'cause winderps doesn't include wget
<jeromelanteri>	twhen i connect 2 monitors: 1 on hmdi, 1 on dvi on a intel onboard graphic driver xf86-intel-video i have the xrandr talk about hdmi2 and hdmi3 and never dvi... then the definition is locked at 1920 x 1080 instead of 2560 x 1400. what's happen ?
<halogene>	if i upload an aur package, do i have to disclose an email address in the opening #maintainer comment, or can i alternatively reference to the id of a specific forum?
<grawity>	personally, i'd insist on an email address
<halogene>	aww
<grawity>	if yours is 'private', then obtain one that's public, or something
<mrelendig>	halogene: anyone that register on aur can see your email anyway
<mrelendig>	in the web interface
<halogene>	spiffing
<halogene>	thanks for the heads-up
<halogene>	:o)
<mrelendig>	just set up a gmail account for public stuff
<mrelendig>	or similar
<halogene>	yeh well i have set up a semi-public email address already for this but i was still reluctant to put it into a pkgbuild
<halogene>	but if it is visible anyway alread to all registered users, what the heck
<halogene>	thanks for the info
<grimx>	i guess youtube has stopped third-party viewers. i can't get smtube to find any videos...
<mrelendig>	 halogene you get a page like https://aur.archlinux.org/account/mr.elendig  when logged in
<phrik>	title: aur (en) - account mr.elendig (at aur.archlinux.org)
<grimx>	all i get is "https://youtube.com/devicesupport"
<mrelendig>	grimx: mpv works
<grimx>	okay
<tomty89>	!give grimx wtf youtube-dl
<phrik>	grimx: community/youtube-dl
<mrelendig>	mpv "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l323ezhb-mu"
<mrelendig>	works fine
<woffs>	yt just introduced apiv3 with "browser api key" required.
<grawity>	the way i see it, if you created something and even claim yourself as a maintainer, then you really should act as a maintainer... part of which is to provide some persistent contact information, not hide behind a web forum like a chicken
<wasamasa>	:v
<grawity>	doesn't have to be your personal / primary inbox, many people have dedicated "archlinux@" or "packages@" or "ois8t67gf7uvwt@" addresses for that
<keenerd>	woffs: actually it was a year ago.  they finally shut down the v2 api.

<halogene>	grawity: it's not like i was very creative
<halogene>	grawity: i only want to make a font easily installable from aur that someone else made (permission is pending)
<halogene>	i've never uploaded any packages to aur so far, so
<halogene>	i guess the maintenance effort for a custom font package is also very low
<halogene>	:o)
<wasamasa>	i don't really see the need for these actually
<wasamasa>	just download the font and put it in ~/.local/share/fonts
<halogene>	what about license information? if you want to retrieve the applicable license of the font later on?
<halogene>	;o)
<wasamasa>	people do that?
<halogene>	if you use your system in a commercially productive environment, you should?
<wasamasa>	well, you do that once when grabbing the font
<wasamasa>	like, be it as webfont or whatever
<halogene>	*shrugs* i think using a properly configured aur package has some benefits - like updates to the font if there are any (actually this font is at version 3.0)
<halogene>	but it's also not that much of an effort and a good way for me to start using aur in the other direction :o)
<beest>	fonts are overrated
<beest>	if you're not getting your information conveyed to you in a series of clicks and beeps you're doing it wrong
<james0r>	i'm on source code pros nuts right now
<james0r>	otherwise i would agree
<halogene>	try to tell that to a marketing division...
<shadowkatstudios>	beest, you mean you're not simply listening to the fsk output of a 10-baud modem as your terminal?
<voidead>	so for some reason chromium will not startup fast like it used to.. sometimes i have to "killall chromium" first and then try it again to get it to pop up.. here is an error: https://ptpb.pw/rnml anyone have any ideas on this?

<jeromelanteri>	tomty89: i tru to use xf86-intel-video driver for the xeon e3-1200 graphic. then i see xstart works fine, but xrandr tell me that there is 2 hdmi connected. i fact, there is one hdmi and one dvi port connected. then the resolution on primary dvi monitor fall down to 1920 x 1080 instead of 2560 x 1440. why and do you have any idea to resolve that ?
<tomty89>	intel probably call all tmds source "hdmi"
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: what do you mean by fall? you mean you don't see that resolution in xrandr?
<tomty89>	make sure you are using a dual-link dvi cable
<tomty89>	and no hdmi/dp->dvi convertor is involved
<tomty89>	also if you your --same-as (mirror), then it would naturally use the lower resolution for both
<jeromelanteri>	no converter, it is a real dvi to dvi cable.
<tomty89>	*use
<jeromelanteri>	no mirror
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: can you at least paste your xrandr outout?
<tomty89>	"fall down" is ambiguous
<sudokode>	not if you're falling down
<jeromelanteri>	but on intel-gfx someone answer me that it an be possible that dvi on this graphic not support more than 1080p...
<tomty89>	yes
<jeromelanteri>	they tell me to decrease frequency by two or use displayport instead of dvi port...
<sudokode>	though.. are you really falling down or accelerating upward?
<tomty89>	i told you above as well

<tomty89>	no need
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: supports dvi-i with max. resolution up to 1920x1200 @ 60hz
<tomty89>	from your mobo manual
<jeromelanteri>	yes...
<tomty89>	so it's a fake dual-link dvi
<jeromelanteri>	with my nvidia, this dual link dvi works just fine.
<tomty89>	or shared resources, idk
<jeromelanteri>	in 2560 x 1440
<tomty89>	dedicate card probably won't give a fake dual-link dvi
<tomty89>	because many problem even have two :|
<jeromelanteri>	http://ix.io/ils
<tomty89>	well doesn't matter anymore, hardware limitation
<jeromelanteri>	yes.
<jeromelanteri>	(crying)
<tomty89>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intel_hd_and_iris_graphics#multiple_monitors
<jeromelanteri>	ok... i try by displayport... but i loose this port for nvidia pci passtrough for vm
<phrik>	title: intel hd and iris graphics - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (at en.wikipedia.org)
<tomty89>	rather a limitation of your cpu/i-gpu than the mobo huh
<fireboot>	am i the only one running into a truckload of issues with the latest kde/plasma?
<tomty89>	!onlyone
<throstur>	i'm unable to install nuget because of conflicting files- error: failed to commit transaction (conflicting files) \n nuget: /lib exists in filesystem. how do i find the offending folder to remove it?
<throstur>	i'm unable to install nuget because of conflicting files- error: failed to commit transaction (conflicting files) \n nuget: /lib exists in filesystem. how do i find the offending folder to remove it?
<tomty89>	throstur: this one? https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nuget/
<phrik>	title: aur (en) - nuget (at aur.archlinux.org)
<throstur>	tomty89: i was installing with pacman, not yaourt, so i didn't think it was in the aur
<tomty89>	oh we got another one in repo
<vangap>	is there a way to look at what dentry objects are for ? for which file paths?
<tomty89>	throstur: same issue here, grats
<throstur>	grats? :d i thought it failed because i had to kill pacman mid-way through installing, didn't think i'd encountered a bug
<tomty89>	:d
<tomty89>	maybe because of mkdir -p ${pkgdir}/usr/lib/pkgconfig
<tomty89>	but idk
<throstur>	so i guess the maintainer, daniel, should fix the issue?
<throstur>	(i don't need nuget now, just happened upon the error)
<tomty89>	i think you can file a bug report if you don't mind
<tomty89>	throstur: hmm https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/44869
<phrik>	title: fs#44869 : [nuget] don't place files into /lib (at bugs.archlinux.org)
<tomty89>	i guess it's only partially fixed
<jeromelanteri>	no... not works more.
<tomty89>	what not works more
<jeromelanteri>	but that is starnge because on the nvidia, the cable dvi give me 2560x1440. so the cable has no limitation 1080p
<jeromelanteri>	i connected only hdmi cable on primary monitor (and not more)
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: it's the intel gpu, not your cable, didn't we talk about it...?
<jeromelanteri>	but definition stay at 920 x 1080 max
<tomty89>	!bail
<phrik>	looks like tomty89 is bailing out on this one - good luck!
<jeromelanteri>	yes, the intel gpu could maybe only on displayport. i thank you talked about cable.
<jeromelanteri>	!cry

<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: http://download.asrock.com/manual/z97%20extreme6.pdf#page=9
<tomty89>	i even give you the wiki page
<tomty89>	sigh i guess i shouldn't bother anymore
<jeromelanteri>	ok... any link for pci passthrough to nvidia with vmware ?
<tomty89>	no, not from me
<jeromelanteri>	i will go with this defition on linux, that's fine if i can use the nvidia.
<tomty89>	i used vmware only when i was a kid
<jeromelanteri>	lol
<jeromelanteri>	and now you use what ?
<tomty89>	like primary school i think
<tomty89>	i don't do vm much, but when i do, qemu
<tomty89>	(with kvm)
<teraflop>	tomty89: youre a rough man now sure you use qemu/kvm
<a-109-107>	any idea why pressing 'meta+v' triggers the actions mapped to 's+f11/f12' in this xresources? http://sprunge.us/dhae
<tomty89>	it's simple and clean
<tomty89>	i don't need magic from virtualbox anyway
<jeromelanteri>	ok, i will go to see on qemu with kvm... but... i'm like a kid, i'm not sure i can do it well... lol
<wasamasa>	!forget cry
<phrik>	forgetting factoid... tada!
<sjums>	and easier to get to work than virtualbox.. if virtualbox hates you
<wasamasa>	lol
<tomty89>	!g microsoft virtualpc
<phrik>	tomty89: download windows virtual pc from official microsoft download ...: <http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3702>
<jeromelanteri>	hoooooo i can with decrease the frequency... alelouya !
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: don't bother
<tomty89>	that's a stupid suggestion
<tomty89>	unless your monitor/tv supports 24hz and you only use it for movies
<teraflop>	the kernel hates vbox, remember the message vbox taints the kernel sometime ago
<jeromelanteri>	my monitor support it well...
<tomty89>	well the hdmi3 one does
<tomty89>	or is it only one monitor
<jeromelanteri>	maybe also there is a correlation between frequency and resolution ability... then, maybe not so down to 24 hz for have 2560 x 1440...
<jeromelanteri>	i have to try that
<tomty89>	the fact is
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: you don't have that mode on 2560x1440 anyway
<tomty89>	s/on/
<tomty89>	/
<tomty89>	1920x1200     59.95*
<tomty89>	well not even 1920x1080
<sjums>	lol tomty89 :) i was being hated by virtualbox on arch, not windows :)
<jeromelanteri>	yes.
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: jeromelanteri: is it one monitor or two monitors here now?
<jeromelanteri>	now i go back on two.
<tomty89>	i am not talking about connection, but real monitors
<jeromelanteri>	because on hdmi or dvi, same limitation on intel graphic card
<tomty89>	real screens
<tomty89>	one or two?
<jeromelanteri>	two
<tomty89>	oh well
<tomty89>	so you want 2560x1440 for both?
<jeromelanteri>	but maybe i have an idea...
<jeromelanteri>	no, only for primary, the second one is a samsung tv
<tomty89>	what are you doing anyway
<tomty89>	why brings in the samsung tv
<tomty89>	when you're not planning to use it
<tomty89>	there's not much trick here, just fact of your monitor and your chips
<jeromelanteri>	i try to connect intel on two monitors, and nvidia on same two monitors (but not same ports) then, have the nvidia only for vm pci passthrougth
<tomty89>	wow
<tomty89>	four connections in total?
<tomty89>	parallel universe?
<jeromelanteri>	yes, how do you know that ?
<jeromelanteri>	total petroleum
<jeromelanteri>	oil and gas...
<jeromelanteri>	so... anyway, i try to use all the stuff...
<crdil>	i have a wierd problem with my usb keyboard i use with my laptop, sometimes when i press a key they are not grabbed.. this usually happends if i havent wrote in a couple of minutes or opens a new application window.. what could cause this?
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: well i have no more suggestions for you, just rtfm of your mobo and accept the limitation
<tomty89>	and swap ports however you like with your wison
<tomty89>	*wisdom
<jeromelanteri>	but if i use the display port for intel, and dvi for nvidia... maybe...
<jeromelanteri>	nvidia is not so limited and dvi on monitor can accept to...
<jeromelanteri>	i have to try it.
<jeromelanteri>	thanks again for patience.
<sysgh0st>	jeromelanteri: i like the idea about the monitor setup. i might implement something like it myself. thanks for the inspiration :)
<teraflop>	crdil: perhaps some energy saving stuff, i had that issue but is was on windows machines
<sysgh0st>	crdil: teraflop have a good point. i had to turn off usb power management in the uefi menu to prevent my usb devices suddenly going *poof*
<crdil>	sysgh0st, ok i will try that
<sysgh0st>	...as in dissapearing. not the blue smoke version. ;)
<crdil>	thx
<sysgh0st>	crdil: more about it here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/power_management#usb_autosuspend
<phrik>	title: power management - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<tomty89>	throstur: oops it seems it's actually fixed already (2.8.5-2), my mirror wasn't updated enough
<tylerdurden01>	have any idea why firefox has this glitch after i used google earth (the app, not the web app)? integrated intel gpu on a laptop http://i.imgur.com/0qwtdsf.png
<tylerdurden01>	it keeps happening after i do graphic-y stuff
<tomty89>	tearfree side effect?
<tylerdurden01>	tomty89: ?
<tomty89>	have you enabled intel tearfree in an xorg conf
<tylerdurden01>	tomty89: nope
<tomty89>	oh okay
<sysgh0st>	tylerdurden01: how much memory is dedicated for the graphics? i've seen similar things when i didn't have enough ram dedicated to the integrated gpu. when i increased the amount of video memory in the uefi-menu, those problems got a lot less intense. (did not dissapear completely though)
<tomty89>	eww
<crdil>	sysgh0st, i didnt have any usb power management menu in my bios so i will try with the udev rules you linked to
<tylerdurden01>	sysgh0st: afaik, i don't have a setting in the uefi/bios (i don't even know in what the hell i'm entering when pressing delete at power up!) that can control that
<sysgh0st>	in my case it's an amd a10 system. i now have 1 gib dedicated to the gpu. if i go less, all kinds of graphical problems start to surface.
<tylerdurden01>	sysgh0st: can i check how much ram i have dedicted in linux?
<sysgh0st>	tylerdurden01: not sure about any commands or logs, but it should be easy: available ram + gpu-dedicated memory = total amount of ram installed in the system.
<thieh>	i need help troubleshooting this:  on startup after shutdown /home fails to mount automatically but i can mount it manually in emergency mode and continue.
<arch-tk>	tylerdurden01: /proc/meminfo will probably hint at it
<tomty89>	thieh: fstab
<sysgh0st>	in my case i only have 7168 mib ram in total, as 1024 mib goes to the gpu
<earnestly>	sysgh0st: kernel reserves a bunch of memory, as does the bios
<thieh>	tomty89:   cat /etc/fstab -> http://pastebin.com/xdwzffwt
<phrik>	title: # # /etc/fstab: static file system information # # (at pastebin.com)
<earnestly>	that's why free or vmstat's output is slightly less
<sysgh0st>	true that
<earnestly>	you can work out how much memory is reserved by counting the reserved regions mentioned at the beginning of dmesg
<earnestly>	pcalc is a handy little tool for that
<thieh>	tomty89: my /home failed before and i replaced it with a new drive, made the user subfolder, changed ownership and edited the /etc/fstab
<sysgh0st>	i also suspec the xorg.0.log file might give a hint on how much memory one have for the graphics.
<earnestly>	oh, dmesg -x kind of does it for you
<earnestly>	[    0.000000] efi: mem13: [reserved           |   |  |  |  |   |wb|wt|wc|uc] range=[0x0000000040000000-0x0000000040200000) (2mb)
<tomty89>	thieh: how did you mount manually in rescue shell
<earnestly>	although it doesn't do: [    0.000000] bios-e820: [mem 0x00000000f80f8000-0x00000000f80f8fff] reserved
<thieh>	mount /dev/sdb1 /home
<tomty89>	thieh: i think it might be because of an invalid option for xfs: data=
<earnestly>	"[    0.000000] memory: 3871376k/4074744k available (5616k kernel code, 896k rwdata, 1796k rodata, 1172k init, 1156k bss, 203368k reserved, 0k cma-reserved)"
<thieh>	so remove the option from /etc/fstab?  i'll see how that works.  thanks
<tomty89>	yeah seems data= is only for ext* filesystem or so
<demize>	urgh, hove to redo my weechat config...
<earnestly>	demize: you get to clear out the cobwebs
<demize>	earnestly: i sort of figured it out btw. somehow it had something to do with my zsh and vim configs being corrupted, because when i checked out the clean ones tab worked again
<xificurc>	regarding weechat, i just found in the manual bindings for inserting bold, colored etc text. does that work for everyone or is it visible for weechat users only?
<grawity>	it's common across irc clients
<earnestly>	demize: probably zsh if you did $terminfo binds
<grawity>	though, on freenode, it is filtered in many channels.
<demize>	earnestly: it seems my old (ancient really..) btrfs had some pretty heavy corruptions.
<grawity>	!rq | rainbow
<phrik>	<iarwain1> grabs you from behind
<thieh>	tomty89:  does genfstab work outside the install environment?
<earnestly>	demize: ah, you should scrub fairly often
<tomty89>	thieh: i think so
<xificurc>	grawity: i see
<earnestly>	demize: so far lucky for me, no errors, but i don't abuse all of the features btrfs has to offer
<thieh>	tomty89:  nope, there isn't any tab completion :/
<tomty89>	!wtf genfstab
<phrik>	tomty89: extra/arch-install-scripts
<tomty89>	but seriouly, just write your own one
<tomty89>	rw,relative,data=ordered is so sick
<namarrgon>	relative?
<thieh>	tomty89:   should i just copy the one from another xfs partition (/)?
<grawity>	just use 'rw'
<demize>	earnestly: yeah, but the issues i'm pretty sure is that that fs is a few years old and has sustained a lot of kernel panics, especially in the beginng of its life.
<tomty89>	i just just use defaults
<tomty89>	unless i need something special
<tomty89>	namarrgon: lol relatime
<earnestly>	demize: that shouldn't cause it problems though, smart will probably help there
<earnestly>	that said, i haven't had btrfs cause a panic yet
<demize>	earnestly: kernel panics can cause fs corruption, sure.
<thieh>	ok rebooting...
<demize>	and it wasn't due to btrfs
<g0ts1ck>	oh
<g0ts1ck>	guys makepkg without dependencies
<arch-tk>	moment of truth, i hope this box reboots successfully.
<tomty89>	huh so that's the reason, it reads from findmnt options
<arch-tk>	it worketh :d
<s00pcan>	basically, i subscribed to xorg-xserver-video-radeon a while back for a specific issue.  seems that all i see on that list is that issue, and it's never fixed
<s00pcan>	(displayport doesn't wake up, requires xrandr --off and on)
<demize>	urgh, sadness
<demize>	weechat logs are fully corrupted
<demize>	oh well, still have znc logs.
<tomty89>	s00pcan: i had that issue as well
<tomty89>	s00pcan: there might be one or two workaround
<demize>	hmm, what did i use for prefix_same_nick..
<xificurc>	any idea why i get results like this? http://sprunge.us/mfge
<tomty89>	s00pcan: it worked for me if you removed this part of code https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/radeon_connectors.c#n92
<phrik>	title: kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git - linux kernel source tree (at git.kernel.org)
<tomty89>	s00pcan: also see if your monitor has a special mode, i found later it seems my monitor does have such a hidden mode to deal with dp issue like this
<tomty89>	from my monitor's manual
<tomty89>	^^^oh *if i
<tomty89>	or maybe even remove from this: https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/radeon_connectors.c#n79 i don't quite remember anymore
<phrik>	title: kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git - linux kernel source tree (at git.kernel.org)
<demize>	and urgh, why is newline chars visible all of a sudden..
<tomty89>	lfcr
<demize>	oh, the nontext ctermbg is different from the normal one... but why didn't it show them before then, argh..
<junka>	if i set my resolv.conf to 127.0.0.1 i cant browse on a new network
<sysgh0st>	junka: new network? as in a different subnet?
<junka>	a new network connection
<sysgh0st>	aha. i guess that you're trying to set localhost (127.0.0.1) as a nameserver then, via the variable "name_servers"?
<sysgh0st>	that won't work unless you have an actual name server service on the same computer (localhost)
<tomty89>	!xyproblem
<phrik>	tell us what you're really trying to do. http://mywiki.wooledge.org/xyproblem
<junka>	i use unbound
<junka>	for unbound to listen, i need to set the resolv.conf to localhost
<junka>	but i cant browser the internet unless i set some dns servers to resolv.conf
<anodesni>	is data synced by google-chrome stored encrypted on my harddrive, or not?
<s00pcan>	tomty89: ok, will look into that.  i've already built good-enough udev work-arounds
<mkoskar>	junka: install `openresolv` and read `man 5 resolvconf.conf`, there is even some starter config for `unbound`
<s00pcan>	tomty89: also, i did actually make it to that part of the source and was attempting to modify it but i didn't really know how to test it easily so that's as far as i got.  the link train stuff sounds familiar
<s00pcan>	from what i saw it seemed like the timeout was way too low - hardcoded to some value that my particular monitor would never finish responding within, so it would just give up and blank
<red-lichtie>	after all these years of upgrades (annual,biannual,etc) i am so glad to have found arch linux! 3 machines migrated so far an not looked back yet! thanks to all you developers and maintainers!
<naypalm>	i keep typing ^r and typing facebook to open firefox
<naypalm>	is there a better wa
<naypalm>	way
<naypalm>	than making a symlink from facebook to firefox
<naypalm>	(awesome wm)
<jeromelanteri>	which can be that a hard drive connected on sata3 port 3 could not be seen on ls /dev but see by the bios ?
<parkerr>	is there a way to search aur by "last packager"? it's a field in the description but not in the search box. i'm trying to find a package i adopted, updated, and then dropped

<braindamage>	there's guidelines, tips and help on the wiki
<jubalh>	great
<jubalh>	writing the pkgbuild and uploading it myself, and then telling a arch user (friend of mine) to install it probably will be enough to make it work? seems like i wont need to intall arch myself right?
<mkoskar>	junka: it gets created by openresolv with your upstream (e.g., dhcp provided) dns servers, that's what you configure in resolvconf.conf, a subscriber, ... then you would have to include that conf in your unbound config
<mkoskar>	junka: or just go to you unbound config and configure some fixed dns servers or you can run dnscrypt etc.
<junka>	mkoskar; i do run dnscrypt
<junka>	my unbound+dnscrypt is configured
<berceanu_>	i cant get xmonad to work with lxde

<sysgh0st>	need a little advice on a mysterious wifi problem i have on a public network. i connect to an unecrypted ssid, where the ap mac oui is 2c:3e:cf (cisco), but soon my laptop loose the connection for a short while, and then reconnects, but once reconnected, the new ap mac oui is 00:21:6a (intel). in other words: a completely different ap. also, the network, ip, netmask, gateways etc have all changed to a mobile operator. what is happening?
<spareproject>	sysgh0st: where are you at?
<junka>	mkoskar; um i dont have dhcpcd, is that a problem?
<mkoskar>	junka: what you need to do is to get down to "manuals" and understand it, it's not just about un-commenting one line, i run with with `dnsmasq` so i don't know `unbound` details, but generally it's like i've described above
<junka>	mkoskar; thanks
<spareproject>	sysgh0st: stupid question but deauth and conecting to random wifi access points isnt hard loads of public wifi places have mitm boxes with pre paid sims
<sysgh0st>	spareproject: stockholm public library. isp: s:t erik kommunikation ab (but once reconnected, the isp is a swedish mobile operator "tre" / "three" )
<ajacobsson>	sysgh0st: man in the middle, someone setting up a rogue ap with their laptop?
<berceanu_>	can anyone help?
<pnsrc>	hi, i want to do a reinstall and i want the packages i have installed reinstalled on the new setup. when i query pacman it lists packages with versions, how could i get a list which could easily be piped to pacman?
<spareproject>	sysgh0st: you got a signal strength finder on your phone? walk around till the signal increases then give someone a slap
<sysgh0st>	ajacobsson: i suspected so too, but i never thought it to be that easy. suddenly forcing someones connection over by dropping their connection.
<sysgh0st>	spareproject: i actually do have one. wifi analyzer for android. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farproc.wifi.analyzer&hl=en
<ajacobsson>	haha sounds like fun
<tigrmesh>	pnsrc, in the pacman log.  there may be a script on the forums or in the wiki
<tigrmesh>	or you can write your own
<mkoskar>	pnsrc: pacman -qsq
<tigrmesh>	that easy?
<tigrmesh>	huh
<pnsrc>	thanks
<spareproject>	sysgh0st: some of the ap's used to have remote code execution when they printed ssid names on the router home page
<spareproject>	if you can host your own
<sysgh0st>	sorry... lost the connection there again briefly. now i'm back on the cisco ap, as it should be.
<sysgh0st>	...and i see someone leaving in a hurry...
<ajacobsson>	haha
<sysgh0st>	man... that opened up my eyes. is it really that easy to snoop on someone by "forcing" oneself to become a man in the middle?
<ajacobsson>	it's pretty simple to do that kind of stuff. cbt nuggets has a video series around backtrack/kali linux and how to crack networks, deauth attacks, rogue ap and things like that.
<ajacobsson>	just a couple of commands really
<spareproject>	you can buy routers set up so you dont even know need to know what your doing set up a vpn to your home stops it pretty easily
<ajacobsson>	i think all he needed for the deauth attacks are mac adresses to the ap and the client (you), and then just run a continous command.
<ajacobsson>	and those are easily found
<sysgh0st>	i've heard of those methods before, but i thought the wifi standard just wasn't so "stupid" on reconnecting to a random ssid no matter what.
<sysgh0st>	good thing is that i never do anything sensitive/personal on unecrypted aps.
<spareproject>	sysgh0st: wifi sucks if it isnt encrypted you can inject pretty much anything because race conditions are just silly
<ajacobsson>	what really opened my eyes to wifi security was that it took me 10 seconds to crack a wpa key with a dictionary attack when the password was a combination of three words found in dictionaries.
<ajacobsson>	now all my passwords are 16-length random characters generated in keepass
<octocpp>	paste!
<slackermike>	i just use "password"
<octocpp>	crap, how do i do that heh
<slackermike>	that's secure, right?
<sysgh0st>	!paste
<phrik>	to paste into the channel use a pastebin: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/common_applications#pastebin_clients
<octocpp>	sysgh0st: lol, thanks
<ajacobsson>	slackermike: totally, what's your email again?
<slackermike>	lol
<ajacobsson>	;)
<sysgh0st>	=)
<octocpp>	can someone check out my dnsmasq error and perhaps lead me to a resolution?http://sprunge.us/raze
<sysgh0st>	i have a rather complex, but yet easy for me to remember password system. based on words and special character combinations that also gives me unique passwords for every account.
<arch_vader>	hi guys im unable to remove udisks2: pacman -rs udisks2 gives 'gvfs: requires udisks2' i want to use udisks
<youngwolf>	hey fellas, can someone help me on how to configure vim?
<slackermike>	easy to remember is the key
<youngwolf>	i dont see a .vimrc file on the home folder
<ajacobsson>	mine aren't, but i dont need to remember them, except for the main one to the keepass database
<ajacobsson>	the ones i keep inside look roughly like this: pa(9d(nrlqi:m!b!a92=
<thespiritof69>	youngwolf, crete one then
<thespiritof69>	*create
<sysgh0st>	arch_vader: you also need to remove gvfs. question, can udisks satisfy the gvfs need for udisks2?
<braindamage>	ajacobsson: 10 seconds is a bit short tough, let's say the dictionary had 10^3 entries, all the permutations are (10^3)^3 = 10^9, typical crack speeds using gpus are in the order of 10^4 trials/s, so you merely tried 10^5 times vs a total set of 10^9, that's 0.01% of the total combinations, you were mostly lucky, iterating it all would've taken a whole day
<berceanu_>	how can i launch xmonad from lxdm?
<arch_vader>	sysgh0st: i recently installed both udisks and udisks2 i must have had gvfs before
<scimmia>	arch_vader, udisks and udisks2 are separate and incompatible. you can't just say "i want to use x", the developer decides that
<ajacobsson>	braindamage: yeah i guess the words used were among the first ones in the dictionary, but it still shocked me. cool seeing that you did the math though :d
<braindamage>	yeah they are typically sorted in order of usage to make attacks statistically faster
<sysgh0st>	arch_vader: googled up: -"gvfs is the virtual filesystem for the gnome desktop, which allows users easy access to remote data via sftp, ftp, webdav, smb, and local data via udev integration, obex, mtp and others."
<sysgh0st>	arch_vader: you might wanna hold on to that gvfs, if you're using gnome and eqvuivalent environments
<ajacobsson>	braindamage: clever :) i used one of the ones that came with kali.
<sysgh0st>	arch_vader: why change udisks2 for the older, and soon deprecated udisks?
<braindamage>	you want to switch dictionary according to language, location, and possible other knowledge over the target, because they can be more statistically likely to be used
<braindamage>	also, the attack is that fast only because you can crack the data locally, where you're only bound by local resources, attacking a remote target is considerably harder since it's the remote throttling your trial speed, and can be easily set to make it pretty infeasible
<arch_vader>	sysgh0st: im trying to automount with pcmanfm but with udisks2 there is no eject button
<red-lichtie>	diceware is a good password generator too
<arch_vader>	i read in the wiki to use udisks in that case
<holomorph>	earnestly: new mupdf has slight fixins to ebooks :p
<sysgh0st>	arch_vader: is it an optical drive that you need to eject?
<dav1d>	how can i get xdg-open to open directories with nautilus?
<arch_vader>	sysgh0st: yes usb flash drives
<sysgh0st>	arch_vader: flash drives themselves don't need to be ejected afaik. unmount and flushing the cache (sync) is often enough for safe removal.
<beest>	(that is the same thing as "ejecting")
<scimmia>	beest, no, actually it's not
<beest>	functionally they are not the same?
<sysgh0st>	beest: kind of, but eject also triggers a mechanical trigger to physically eject the media.
<scimmia>	eject makes it unavailable to the system
<scimmia>	try it some time
<sysgh0st>	...as in ejecting a optical drive caddy.
<saivert>	for usb devices you can also remove the usb device from the usb stack.
<scimmia>	sysgh0st, eject has a different meaning for usb
<s-s-l>	svenstaro: i've flagget bullet as out of date
<beest>	so if i hit "eject" in a file manager or some such it will no longer be available as a block device?
<scimmia>	beest, right
<saivert>	nautilus does that afaik
<saivert>	but it uses the gio, udisks framework for that job
<beest>	and i'll be damned, that's exactly what happens with pcmanfm (presumably with gvfs)
<beest>	i hardly use it so i never notice such things
<scimmia>	arch_vader, the question is, do you really need to "eject" a usb drive?
<arch_vader>	sysgh0st: when i insert the usb drive it shows up in a folder but when i reinsert it it shows up in a duplicate folder
<scimmia>	there are uses for it, such as leaving things connected to charge, but they aren't that common
<saivert>	luckily you can still unmount from gnome disks utility and not lose the usb device at the same time in case you want to repartition the usb drive
<sysgh0st>	arch_vader: i see, so it hasn't been unmounted proberly, and thus leaving a "ghost" mount behind... or so i believe.
<arch_vader>	sysgh0st: so i do need to eject? how do i fix this?
<sysgh0st>	i always prefered the semi-manual removal of usb-devices. i just right-click them in my file manager, and choose "safely remove ..." (a.k.a "eject")
<saivert>	if something has a lock on the files on the usb drive it may be left behind as a ghost until you kill the process that has the lock
<saivert>	as in "file/folder in use"
<sysgh0st>	arch_vader: not sure what the problem is really. there is not safe way to detach the media optin in a menu before physically removing it?
<arch_vader>	sysgh0st: "safely remove" does not appear in pcmanfm
<scimmia>	is there any "unmount" options?
<arch_vader>	scimmia: no and i read in the wiki this is an issue with udisks2
<scimmia>	arch_vader, link?
<scimmia>	arch_vader, you had previously said that the issue was eject with udisks2, not unmount, so i'd like to see what you're talking about
<arch_vader>	scimmia: i read it a while ago...im looking for it the option does not show up in pcmanfm
<sysgh0st>	arch_vader: perhaps this can help. the second post hve one interestinf udev rule that sets some permissions for varoius useful "actions". https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7733716.html
<scimmia>	arch_vader, right click on the volume on the left, what do you see?
<arch_vader>	scimmia: it does not show up as a volume but as a folder
<scimmia>	arch_vader, then switch away from "directory tree"
<scimmia>	and *nix does not have folders
<sledgehammer>	now everyone read the arch wiki :)
<arch_vader>	scimmia: i meant it shows up as a directory :)
<scimmia>	so like i said, switch away from the "directory tree" view
<godginrai>	sysgh0st: i know that in german, the "w" makes a "v" sound, but in english, the word is spelled "vast"
<arch_vader>	scimmia: sysgh0st : thanks scimmia it shows up when i switch away from directory view :d
<arch_vader>	scimmia: sysgh0st : so i guess there was no issue at all. sorry my bad
<sysgh0st>	i never got that automount to work satisfactorily myself. i prefer the good ol' mount/dismount actions from within the file manager. besides i don't like file systems to mount at the point of insertion/detection. i prefer only to mount when i need it to.
<sysgh0st>	godginrai: yeah. true that. sorry about my complete lack of spelling skills today. i blame my keyboard, and my three brain cells. they aren't completely awake today.
<godginrai>	sysgh0st: nah, it's fine.  just bringing it to your attention. ;)
<sysgh0st>	so. problem solved. phrik... do your thing.
<sysgh0st>	!next
<phrik>	another satisfied customer! next!
<hyo0301>	yo
<godginrai>	hyo0301: get your dual boot up and running yesterday?
<hyo0301>	yep it works like a charm
<hyo0301>	except, now i cna't access internet
<cloudef>	lol
<hyo0301>	neither with netctl and systemd-networkd
<hyo0301>	found this guy https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=152165
<phrik>	title: systemd-fstab-generator[151]: failed to create unit file: file exists / newbie corner / arch linux forums (at bbs.archlinux.org)
<cloudef>	i guess it works better when you can't access internet :p
<hyo0301>	no, i want to go on my i3 or awesome :'(
<hyo0301>	no one knows how to fix that ...
<hyo0301>	!netctl
<phrik>	users having issues with netctl are advised to try alternatives such as systemd-networkd, networkmanager, or connman.
<sysgh0st>	bah! ... who neets the internet? silly fad.
<godginrai>	hyo0301: is it just wifi that's not working? or ethernet as well?
<sledgehammer>	hyo0301, can you get your net connected manually?
<sysgh0st>	needs*
<hyo0301>	godginrai: i use ethernet
<godginrai>	hyo0301: well, for the mean time, you can use dhcpcd to get connected
<hyo0301>	sledgehammer: how? systemctl enable dhcpc.service?
<sledgehammer>	hyo0301, no - run the underlying commands e.g. dhcpcd, as godginrai just suggested
<sledgehammer>	or ip ... , if it's a static connection you want
<plujon>	systemd-journald.service restarts on me intermittently, which forces my desktop to restart.  today, it did this, and dmesg indicates it terminated because it was given signal sigabrt: http://ix.io/im2 .  any ideas on how i can find out why this signal was delivered to systemd-journald?
<d_garbage>	your desktop restarts because of the journal?
<agaurav77>	has anyone used libimobiledevice?
<sledgehammer>	plujon, what's in your journal just before it receives the signal?
<sledgehammer>	!give agaurav77 ask
<phrik>	agaurav77: don't ask to ask, if anyone is here or alive, or uses something. just ask, and we'll get moving along. thanks.
<agaurav77>	ok... sorry
<hyo0301>	sledgehammer: godginrai: i don't understand o_o dhcpcd is not a command
<grawity>	agaurav77: like, when writing a program, or as part of an existing program?
<sledgehammer>	hyo0301, ... yes it is
<hyo0301>	dhcpcd eth0?
<agaurav77>	grawity : to connect an ipad first gen to arch linux
<octocpp>	well, i got pxe boot to work serving the cd up on the tftp server
<agaurav77>	doesnt show up in lsblk
<godginrai>	hyo0301: you don't have to run the underlying command, but you don't need to "enable" dhcpcd.  you can just temporarily start it with `sudo systemctl start dhcpcd.service`
<octocpp>	wonder why i could not use pfsense as the dhcp server
<hyo0301>	i did that, doesn't work
<hyo0301>	can't ping or anything
<octocpp>	i kept getting an error that the tftp client would not except options, and it could not get the .cfg files
<hyo0301>	idk what i did
<hyo0301>	w: down, e: down
<hyo0301>	 @i3
<junka>	mkoskar; no unbound-resolvconf.conf is being created, i tried pointing it o my unbound.conf, which worked in the sense of pointing resolv.conf to use localhost, but i still use my isp's dns
<sledgehammer>	agaurav77, it's not a block device, so no, it won't show up in lsblk
<agaurav77>	sledgehammer: so where do i check if its connected or not?
<sledgehammer>	agaurav77, how about describing exactly what you did? :|
<hyo0301>	alright then, back to windows
<godginrai>	hyo0301: what's the value of netctl and systemd-networkd when you check `systemctl list-units`?
<plujon>	sledgehammer: good question: http://ix.io/im7
<hyo0301>	there are lots of them godginrai which one?
<agaurav77>	sledgehammer: installed libimobiledevice using pacman, and then connected ipad (1st gen) ... clueless on how to access data further
<hyo0301>	most are runnings
<grawity>	agaurav77: pacman -ql libimobiledevice | grep /bin/
<sledgehammer>	agaurav77, our wiki contains clues, try looking for them
<agaurav77>	grawity : its installed ok
<grawity>	junka: what do you manage your network with, and what does your /etc/resolvconf.conf have?
<agaurav77>	sledgehammer : okay thanks
<agaurav77>	i ll look up and come back if i get stuck :)
<grawity>	agaurav77: yes, i know it's installed, that's not what i was telling you to check
<agaurav77>	oh i got it
<sledgehammer>	agaurav77, why didn't you look there first?
<agaurav77>	you mean the executables which can help me
<grawity>	yes
<agaurav77>	sledgehammer : my bad
<godginrai>	hyo0301: specifically netctl and systemd-networkd
<agaurav77>	thanks a ton
<sdough>	i'm using xfce4, and for reasons i have yet to establish my volume intermittently resets to 100%. i'm using headphones without inline volume control, so this is quite jarring. any ideas what to check?
<grawity>	sdough: pulseaudio or plain alsa?
<sdough>	pulseaudio
<grawity>	try disabling flat-volumes
<sdough>	heh. one of the top results is https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/2rjiaa/horrible_decisions_flat_volumes_in_pulseaudio_a/
<phrik>	title: horrible decisions: flat volumes in pulseaudio (a rant) : linux (at www.reddit.com)
<earnestly>	(and possible removing the .tdb files to reset any iffy state as a result of flat-volumes)
<earnestly>	as implemented, flat-volume is terrible
<earnestly>	it works okay in windows
<godginrai>	sdough: rather than jarring, that actually sounds kind of dangerous
<earnestly>	it is
<earnestly>	my own pulseaudio package disables it
<sdough>	it seems like it should be disabled by default?
<earnestly>	i'd recommend every distro deviate from upstream in this regard
<earnestly>	sdough: no, it's enabled by default
<sdough>	i understand that it is; i'm agreeing with you.
<godginrai>	earnestly: what is flat-volume supposed to do... in theory?
<earnestly>	godginrai: the reddit link explains it nicely
<junka>	grawity; connman and resolv_conf=/etc/resolv.conf name_servers=127.0.0.1 unbound_conf=/etc/unbound/unbound.conf
<godginrai>	ok, i'll take a look at that
<grawity>	junka: hrmm, i don't think connman uses resolvconf, does it?
<grawity>	junka: it even has a built-in dns cache instead
<godginrai>	earnestly: ooh yea, i could see how that could be troublesome
<grawity>	junka: (as for the latter, it's better to use something like unbound_conf=/etc/unbound/unbound-resolv.conf, and 'include' it from within the main unbound.conf)
<hyo0301>	godginrai: nvm i fixed it by remounting lmao
<hyo0301>	anyway should i use alsa or udev? for sound
<godginrai>	hyo0301: remounting fixed it?
<octocpp>	hyo0301: i just fixed somthing by rebooting.
<grawity>	.... udev has nothing to do with your sound
<junka>	grawity; what should unbound-resolvconf.conf is going to have?
<grawity>	junka: it'll be generated by resolvconf
<grawity>	it'll automatically have "forward-zone" blocks then
<junka>	grawity; on my unbound.conf i have forward-zone to 127.0.0.1@40
<earnestly>	godginrai: http://patrickbaudisch.com/publications/2004-baudisch-chi04-flatvolumecontrol.pdf (the study is total shit, look for flaws in the methodology for fun and giggles.)
<hyo0301>	grawity: wiki says it
<godginrai>	lol
<grawity>	junka: wait why
<junka>	grawity; the wiki suggested it so for unbound
<junka>	and dnscrypt
<earnestly>	godginrai: btw, this is why new devices in alsa are always muted
<earnestly>	much to the confusion of many people
<braindamage>	 https://i.imgur.com/gllexoh.png
<earnestly>	:d
<teraflop>	junka: are you using dnscrypt + unbound for dnssec validation?
<junka>	teraflop; yes!
<earnestly>	what bothers me a bit is how much added code complexity flat-volumes requires :(
<teraflop>	junka: i didn't knew there's a wiki page about that
<fr^2>	finally switched to arch on my pc at work.
<teraflop>	junka: i just do just as in my freebsd boxes
<teraflop>	junka: also i do not use dnsmaq at all
<freezingcold>	what the fuck is cups' daemon called now?!
<freezingcold>	fucking bitch, why is it always being renamed?
<rkreis>	freezingcold, org.cups.cupsd.service last time i checked
<cloudef>	freezingcold: cuppy
<jushur>	junka: just so you know, dnscrypt will not be secure if your isp decides to do a mitm attack on you.
<namarrgon>	ohboy, tmux 2.0
<junka>	jushur; what are you suggesting
*	topic for #archlinux is: welcome to arch linux world domination, inc. <+> read: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=57205 <+> be patient with those willing to learn and be kind to those willing to teach. <+> hubble is 25, all hail our science overlord: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2oiaa1tdre
<junka>	teraflop; sure
<teraflop>	junka: ok gimme a sec
<hyo0301>	alsa ?!
<sdough>	grawity, earnestly: thanks for the help!
<ahop>	hi!
<teraflop>	junka: /etc/conf.d/dnscrypt-proxy http://ix.io/h0u , /etc/unbound/unbound.conf http://ix.io/imc
<ahop>	is there a way to install arch by just "dd" an image into /dev/sda5 (if sda5 is the partition)
<ahop>	or impossible to do that way?
<grawity>	sure, as long as you _have_ such an image
<hyo0301>	all i have is a frikkin beep sound on my pc, not even headset godginrai
<ahop>	grawity doesn't archlinux.org provide one ?
<grawity>	no, it provides images containing an "installation" environment (a livecd), not an "installed" environment
<ahop>	ok
<plujon>	it appears that the timer issues i mentioned yesterday were not actually resolved with nohz=off .
<ahop>	we are currently running the liveusb in the hackerspace here, and are fighting with installing it actually now ;)
<grawity>	the former runs off read-only squashfs images and contains configuration specific to livecd/liveusb
<namarrgon>	"here"?
<ahop>	here in my town ;)
<grawity>	→ . ←
<sledgehammer>	ahop, installing arch should be easy for hackers :)
<namarrgon>	i don't see a hackerspace around here
<teraflop>	junka: i also use openresolv and have /etc/resolvconf.conf http://ix.io/gxw
<grawity>	bloody hell half my numpad is not working
<ahop>	here; i mean irl
<junka>	teraflop; you are not pointing to unbound-resolvconf.conf :/
<ahop>	do you know an easy install guide?
<ahop>	i have found a few howto, but they all have 15 steps
<teraflop>	junka: this config works nicely, it does cache+dnssec validation
<grawity>	fdisk, mkfs, mount, pacstrap, hostname, locale, bootloader
<oskude>	ahop: learn it once and write a script to automate the next ones :)
<teraflop>	junka: that's the way i do, sure there are other ways
<teraflop>	junka: i point to 127.0.0.1 that is what you want, isn't it?
<ahop>	grawity: my friend asks why pacstrap is needed to download the packages, since the packages are already present from the liveusb iso ?
<grawity>	ahop: they aren't
<grawity>	the iso only has a modified installed system, but no copies of installable packages
<braindamage>	what file contains the kernel build flags in my system? a quick search failed me
<grawity>	/proc/config.gz
<braindamage>	ah, zipped, that's why search on system failed, thanks
<berceanu_>	i manadged to get xmonad running :)
<earnestly>	braindamage: gzip -cd /proc/config.gz | less
<teraflop>	junka: ... openresolv pakage /etc/resolvconf.conf http://ix.io/gxw
<ahop>	oh ok
<grawity>	earnestly: so, zless?
<berceanu_>	but now i have a prob with things that stay in the tray, like pidgin
<grawity>	ahop: it's large only because it has binaries for two architectures, and a bunch of rescue/recovery tools
<earnestly>	grawity: except read the script for zless and consider sanity
<berceanu_>	i.e. there is no tray :p
<junka>	teraflop; thanks i'll try modifing my own configs a bit
<teraflop>	junka: np, good luck
<grawity>	berceanu_: so run something like stalonetray or whatever's in fashion this week
<earnestly>	keenerd: i'm not quite sure how to interpret results like this from namcap: http://ix.io/imf
<earnestly>	keenerd: that is, i had included all of those as dependencies before, removed them and eh.
<berceanu_>	grawity, are u being sarcastic?
<earnestly>	keenerd: what gets me is why it thinks they're satisified, e.g. why would orc be considered satisified?
<aremis117>	what are the options for flash?  i can't seem to get it to work on any site i go on.
<earnestly>	[the only option flash has is to remove it. :/]
<scimmia>	earnestly, split package?
<earnestly>	scimmia: no splitting used
<scimmia>	strange then
<scimmia>	aremis117, what browser?
<teraflop>	an orc is never satisfied ^
<earnestly>	scimmia: maybe modular stuff is just to confusing, like wine
<earnestly>	too*
<aremis117>	i've been using opera, but i get the same effect in chromium and firefox as well scimmia
<godginrai>	aremis117: what do you mean by "options"?
<scimmia>	aremis117, there is a big difference. firefox will use flash-plugin in extra, but the other two won't. they would need chromium-pepper-flash in the aur
<godginrai>	also, why would you use opera? <.<
<earnestly>	godginrai: it used to be not terrible
<scimmia>	at least i think opera will use chromium-pepper-flash
<godginrai>	earnestly: yea.  but it got replaced with a pos chrome clone.
<earnestly>	i'm looking forward to qt's new webengine
<earnestly>	which is basically chromium and all of its features
<earnestly>	so browsers like qutebrowser can use it
<godginrai>	another webkit browser?
<earnestly>	except based on chromium, webkit is dead
<homerj>	because what the world needs is another webkit browser
<earnestly>	it needs webkit it go away
<godginrai>	apple still maintains webkit, don't they?
<earnestly>	and something better to replace it
<godginrai>	homerj: ikr?
<scimmia>	yes, they do
<earnestly>	godginrai: then there's webkitgtk
<scimmia>	plus the gtk and efl ports
<aremis117>	godfinrai - i like opera, that's why i use it
<scimmia>	maintained by their own teams
<homerj>	i'm a firefox diehard, so i have no real horse in the race of better browsers
<godginrai>	scimmia: i thought samsung maintained the efl port
<homerj>	i like what mozilla is doing, and i like firefox
<earnestly>	homerj: i was, no reason to be anymore.  just looking for something sane
<scimmia>	godginrai, they do, but it's just a few people
<the-compiler>	homerj: like putting ads in the "new tab" page? ;)
<godginrai>	i see
<earnestly>	homerj: like caving on eme and h264?
<demonicmaniac3>	there are no sane browsers
<the-compiler>	demonicmaniac3++
<homerj>	earnestly, you can't win them all
<demonicmaniac3>	even though it's closed source i'll be looking at vivaldi
<scimmia>	i'm not sure how the qt port is handled, was it forked?
<earnestly>	homerj: apparently you can't win any of them
<aremis117>	homerj:  theres no real difference between browsers to me :p what name do you like, how much ram do you wanna fork over
<demonicmaniac3>	as there are no free alternatives anyways
<the-compiler>	scimmia: qt port of what?
<earnestly>	homerj: so what good does mozilla do now?
<scimmia>	webkit
<earnestly>	homerj: still lie to their userbase about how firefox respects users and is secure?
<the-compiler>	scimmia: it used to be in upstream webkit until somewhen in 2013 i think, and then it was forked
<godginrai>	earnestly: i'm against one rendering engine having all the power.  tell me about the latest, greatest browser when it uses gecko, presto, or some other minority rendering engine
<jupelius>	is it possible to make 'make' use certain -j parameter every time?
<grawity>	export makeflags="-j $(nproc)"
<jupelius>	without defining an alias for it
<earnestly>	i don't hate firefox, but i see no reason why anyone would swear allegiance to it either
<tylerdurden01>	ok, i'm going to try to switch my apps to pulseaudio. wish me luck for i'll need it!
<homerj>	earnestly, as opposed to chrome?
<homerj>	well, i just like firefox
<grawity>	earnestly: it's a thing fanboys do
<homerj>	i've been using it for years, chrome doesn't do anything it doesn't
<earnestly>	homerj: yeah, chrome is actually secure, that security does provide better user privacy by the nature of such protection
<grawity>	earnestly: it is very rarely rational
<earnestly>	godginrai: software doesn't really work like society.  there is always going to be a mathematical best, and everything will converge on it.
<grawity>	users, however, don't really work like software
<earnestly>	so phrases like "having all the power" really makes no sense.
<earnestly>	ideally yes, you'd have xy component having all the power
<earnestly>	e.g. just wayland instead of wayland and xorg
<earnestly>	you concentrate all development and fixes into a single source, everyone benefits
<earnestly>	e.g. the kernel
<the-compiler>	daamn, i thought  make -j  (without a number) would find out the number of cpus
<earnestly>	grawity: i mean the non-user facing stuff
<earnestly>	the-compiler: lol :p
<godginrai>	earnestly: except when the people who hold the ropes are big companies who can choose what goes in and what doesn't based on their business interests
<the-compiler>	"if the -j option is given without an argument, make will not limit the number of jobs that can run simultaneously."
<godginrai>	earnestly: which is the case with webkit
<earnestly>	godginrai: you can always fork it
<holomorph>	silly make
<earnestly>	godginrai: yay open source
<grawity>	earnestly: i'd say everyone benefits from competition as well
<godginrai>	you can fork it, but that doesn't matter if you don't get the userbase with it
<godginrai>	they will just push new features and force you to come into line with them
<earnestly>	grawity: nature seems to contradict that, e.g. the baboon troop dr. robert sapolsky followed
<grawity>	earnestly: since often improvements are just done to be better than everything else
<homerj>	yeah, i'm just a bit of a fan, i mean, generally i don't care with software, i just use what works
<grawity>	earnestly: well, software doesn't work like nature :)
<godginrai>	remember when opera and ff had to start implementing random webkit features for mobile?
<homerj>	but firefox has worked for me for years
<godginrai>	shit that *wasn't* part of the standard?
<homerj>	and nothing in chrome really says "i should change over to it"
<the-compiler>	i hate all browsers.
<earnestly>	grawity: when all the aggressive males died for taking priviledge over a bunch of meat infected with tb, the troop become much more cooperative and thrived, even teaching new males that their ways are different.
<homerj>	i like the extensions i have, and yeah, i could change over, there are analogs to the extensions, etc. but then i'm just back to where i started
<the-compiler>	(says a browser developer, yep)
<homerj>	a browser that works
<grawity>	earnestly: yes, but you just said that software doesn't really work like society >_>
<earnestly>	grawity: a lot of people confuse competition with cooperation and cooperation is always better in every situation throughout history
<grawity>	anyway, improvements are often driven just by the desire to be better than everything else
<earnestly>	sport is a cooperative passtime, for example.  a true competition would have no rules
<grawity>	and if there's no "everything else", you get stuck with crap like comcast
<earnestly>	that's not true
<homerj>	there are always rules
<homerj>	this isn't 'nam
<godginrai>	as a person stuck with comcast, i find grawity's point to be quite valid
<earnestly>	grawity: improvements are often driven by the desire to be better, by mastery.
<earnestly>	godginrai: the problem with that analogy is ordinary people can't /do/ anything about it
<cloudef>	unless they become isp
<james0r>	even 'nam had rules
<godginrai>	earnestly: ordinary people can't *do* anything about google holding the reigns to blink, or apple holding the reigns to webkit
<earnestly>	cloudef: cf. natural monopolies (e.g. water, electricity, etc.)
<james0r>	however trampled on
<earnestly>	godginrai: yes they can
<godginrai>	earnestly: no, they really can't
<cloudef>	there was country where people started rolling ethernet cables to each other houses, they iirc have fastest internet on the world right now
<earnestly>	godginrai: it is well within your ability to just fork the project
<earnestly>	godginrai: with almost no physical effort or monetary cost to yourself
<godginrai>	earnestly: certainly.  but i have no power even after forking the project
<sudokode>	hi!
<earnestly>	you have power over your fork
<godginrai>	earnestly: and without power, you cannot effect change
<earnestly>	godginrai: this is what happened to gcc
<sudokode>	who's changing what today?
<earnestly>	the gcc you're using isn't actually gcc, it's egcs
<sudokode>	godginrai and the world?
<godginrai>	earnestly: which no one will use because everyone is using chrome.  thus, my fork is meaningless
<sudokode>	it's not meaningless. it's your fork
<sudokode>	people fork linux all the time. they don't change the world
<homerj>	it's my fork and i need it now
<earnestly>	captin, the facepalms, i'm giving them all she's got!
<homerj>	call j.g wentworth
<sudokode>	just the majority of linux users pull from linus' repo
<homerj>	877-fork-now
<matse>	since updating to kernel 4 my outgoing traffic that ifconfig shows under tx or awesomes netwidget is totally wrong. i have just booted and already 710gib tx traffic and 52kib outgoing traffic (which seems to be right). booting lts kernel helps and the traffic is shown correctly
<matse>	has anybody else experienced such a problem?
<sudokode>	first off, ifconfig
<sudokode>	get rid of it
<earnestly>	godginrai: look at even wine-staging today
<godginrai>	sudokode: you're not getting the point.  without influence, the fork cannot help enforce good standards
<holomorph>	!trollcat
<phrik>	http://i.imgur.com/bg4qy.jpg
<sudokode>	if the point of the fork is to change things, then yes, it's not gonna work
<matse>	sudokode: also awesomes netwidget and nload...
<godginrai>	sudokode: that is exactly the point
<sudokode>	that's a bad reason to make a fork
<earnestly>	godginrai: if you want people to use your fork you have to give them a reason, you have to put in the work to explain why, go to conferences.
<godginrai>	sudokode: that's what earnestly is suggesting i do if i don't like google and apple controlling webkit
<cloudef>	people only fork projects when they want to change the name
<sudokode>	you're essentially saying you've abandoned all other avenues and upstream is not able to work with you
<sudokode>	rageforks never work out
<sudokode>	godginrai: well, you do put yourself in control in that case
<saivert>	why not if you have your own private patches to the code?
<saivert>	that is essentially a fork anyways
<sudokode>	you just don't put yourself in a very good position to change anything
<saivert>	not everything is accepted upstream so you have to maintain own patches to fix things you want
<sudokode>	saivert: if you're just patching it for your own use, that's not really a fork
<godginrai>	sudokode: exactly.  and if i can't change anything, then google and apple still reign supreme
<homerj>	there's only two good reasons to fork, 1) you have a feature the core devs don't want do you put it in anyways and the people will determine if it's worthwhile and maybe it goes back to the original project 2) a couple of the the core devs are total jagoffs and everyone else just works on a fork and leaves the original behind
<sudokode>	because you're getting everything from upstream and just changing a few things
<godginrai>	sudokode: hence why competition from other rendering engines is important.
<earnestly>	homerj: the 2) point is what happened to gcc
<sysgh0st>	http://blog.codinghorror.com/oh-yeah-fork-you/
<phrik>	title: oh yeah? fork you! (at blog.codinghorror.com)
<godginrai>	sudokode: because it forces companies to work together on the standards
<matse>	so nobody else has a problem with the wrong amount of traffice being shown by programs like ifconfig, nload, netwidget ?
<sudokode>	godginrai: did you ever think x could use a makeover?
<earnestly>	godginrai: that's not mutually exclusive...
<sudokode>	it's happening in at least 2 places now
<earnestly>	!give matse ifconfig
<phrik>	matse: don't use ifconfig, see http://inai.de/2008/02/19
<sudokode>	not forks. replacements
<junka>	teraflop; no luck :p
<sudokode>	that's pretty epic
<matse>	earnestly: as i said... it's not only ifconfig...
<homerj>	well, that's what kind of happend to xfree86
<earnestly>	matse: why are you assuming it's wrong?
<matse>	earnestly: every program i used so far
<matse>	earnestly: i have an umts modem with max 10gib per month...
<sudokode>	earnestly: he thinks it should be reset when he reboots
<homerj>	as much as people like to think x.org sucks now, they don't remember xfree86
<earnestly>	matse: check with ss, nethogs, iftop, etc.
<matse>	earnestly: and according to these programs i just used 720gib during the last 10 minutes
<godginrai>	sudokode: talking about wayland?  i never really had problems with x, so i didn't really care.  now that wayland is being toted as the successor to x, i'll try it out once it has solutions for the features in x i used.
<matse>	earnestly: also if i boot lts kernel it is shown correctly
<mrelendig>	homerj: xfree86 fork was mostly about licensing
<earnestly>	matse: *shrug*
<mrelendig>	homerj: it was basicly tunring into closed source
<sudokode>	godginrai: yeah but there's also mir
<mrelendig>	turning*
<sudokode>	and there are probably other display servers out there
<homerj>	mrelendig, there were plenty of reasons
<saivert>	homerj: wasn't that mainly because of a licensing issue?
<godginrai>	sudokode: what about it?
<mrelendig>	homerj: license was the biggest one
<earnestly>	nouveau came from nv become obfuscated
<homerj>	i just can't wait for wayland to be what everyone uses
<sudokode>	godginrai: well, you now have 2 replacements that could really take over x's market
<earnestly>	becoming*
<sudokode>	that's no small feat, but it's happening
<homerj>	video cards need to be able to support it
<homerj>	that's the one thing that's really stopping it at this point
<earnestly>	godginrai: look into the history of gcc and egcs
<sudokode>	homerj: no one cares atm. they have open driver support
<homerj>	of all the x replacements over the years, wayland is the closest to finally getting rid of x
<earnestly>	look at what wine-staging is doing for wine
<sudokode>	and nvidia is planning wayland support in 2015
<godginrai>	sudokode: sure, but each is supported by influential people and companies.
<homerj>	y
<sudokode>	godginrai: exactly
<sudokode>	because you'll never find a big open source project that isn't funded by a company
<earnestly>	godginrai: so your whole argument is "i'm little and suck so my fork won't mean anything because no one will use it, because i don't even bother putting it forward and argh!"??
<sudokode>	because there's no money in writing open source software unless someone pays you to do it :p
<earnestly>	why do you think almost every distro is switching to systemd?
<spyhawk>	because systemd sucks!
<earnestly>	because lennart, for better or worse, marketted the crap out of it.  he addressed real problems
<spyhawk>	hem... wait... :d
<godginrai>	sudokode: that's my point behind the separate rendering engines.  dillo will be unlikely to ever enact a change in standards, but big browser devs like microsoft and mozilla can.  opera could as well, until they jumped onto webkit
<homerj>	earnestly, that's the one thing i really give lennart real credit for
<earnestly>	there have been dozens of similarish inits, but the developers would rather they stay quiet
<homerj>	it's hard to get stuff like that actually accepted
<homerj>	and he did it twice
<earnestly>	he went to conferences, he spoke to people
<sudokode>	yeah, lennart is nothing if not influential
<earnestly>	you put the effort in, then you get something
<homerj>	pulseaudio for instance wasn't the first effort to try and get some sanity to sound
<earnestly>	just forking and whining about no one using it is pathetic
<sudokode>	earnestly: plus he has people paying for his expenses while he writes the code
<homerj>	or even the best one
<homerj>	the best option would have been using ossv4
<earnestly>	homerj: ossv4 is not good
<godginrai>	oss killed itself when it temporarily went closed source, iirc
<earnestly>	in-kernel mixing is dead
<homerj>	earnestly, a few years ago, it was
<earnestly>	homerj: barely
<sudokode>	godginrai: that's really the issue. if you wanna work on a big open source project, you either need to have money saved up to support yourself, get a ton of people to do a ton of small tasks, or get employed by a company that is interested in the open source project
<earnestly>	homerj: even osx uses a userspace daemon for mixing
<homerj>	it's better than alsa
<homerj>	heh
<sudokode>	it's essentially like any other research funding
<homerj>	although is that saying much?
<earnestly>	alsa is a kernel api
<saivert>	oss' drivers you mean?
<earnestly>	homerj: yes.
<godginrai>	sudokode: definitely true
<saivert>	as in the driver framework not the sound server
<earnestly>	homerj: coreaudio is a brilliant piece of work
<saivert>	don't mix the two
<earnestly>	homerj: read more about paul davis, the jack / ardour guy
<earnestly>	he writes some interesting things
<earnestly>	especially in his epic rant against the klang idiot ;p
<sudokode>	klang!
<homerj>	pulseaudio is at least serviceable now
<homerj>	although configuring it is still a total pain
<homerj>	if it doesn't "just work" you're going to have a bad time
<demonicmaniac3>	and look how long glibc change took
<demonicmaniac3>	if the people "owning" the project just say "no"
<demonicmaniac3>	getting critical mass for a fork is hard
<godginrai>	homerj: that's true for alsa, too.  i haven't used jack or oss, so i can't comment on those
<demonicmaniac3>	especially when people invested shittons in the "original"
<bougyman>	no, alsa is easy as heck to configure
<demonicmaniac3>	if you have software stack that's massive built on top of stuff that turned to shit due to management
<bougyman>	i have a bunch of .asoundrc files created over the years.
<godginrai>	demonicmaniac3: my point exactly
<bougyman>	everything from bluetooth to usb speakerphones and such.
<demonicmaniac3>	then you're pretty much fucked for years
<homerj>	i used to use ossv4 it worked, but then it was one of those things where not a lot of stuff was configured to use it anymore
<homerj>	and there was an alsa emulation part to it
<scimmia>	homerj, what advantages did you find in oss over alsa?
<demonicmaniac3>	if you don't have a big name already and backing from important people you won't get noticed and denounced as a troll quickly
<demonicmaniac3>	without anybody even bothering to look
<scimmia>	only thing i remember about oss was what a huge pita it was
<homerj>	scimmia, well, at the time, it could do things like change outputs
<homerj>	you plugged in headphones, it would flip over
<saivert>	demonicmaniac3: if it is important enough to you don't give up
<homerj>	as far as api, i never touched it that low level, if i needed sound, i just used sdl
<homerj>	which hides a lot of the insanity
<saivert>	*sigh* lots of "scanned document" "from xeroxmachine" spam lately
<saivert>	with malware attachments
<junka>	should i use nsd? will it make it work?
<demonicmaniac3>	if you really have only one browser with corporate backing - or even 2 with iewwwh and chrome - then they decide webstandards
<demonicmaniac3>	which is not something i really want
<homerj>	man, i tell you what though
<demonicmaniac3>	because both corps are fucknuts
<homerj>	even as bad as some make pulseaudio out to be
<homerj>	those esd/arts days
<bougyman>	i find no significant difference.
<bougyman>	as a matter of fact esd was less crashy for me than pulse seems to be.
<bougyman>	i can crash pulse with dozens of videos. it takes nothing more than to play them with mplayer.
<homerj>	bougyman, the goofy part was not everything supported esd
<homerj>	some things needed arts
<homerj>	some things just wanted oss or alsa
<bougyman>	homerj: just k-stuff wanted arts.
<homerj>	yes
<sudokode>	demonicmaniac3: if that scares, don't ever look into how many corporations control the food supply
<bougyman>	most stuff supported esd and everything supported alsa/oss.
<homerj>	but i used kde
<bougyman>	but back then many sound cards still had hardware mixing :)
<sudokode>	in the us, about 95% of food products are made by just 10 companies
<bougyman>	so oss/alsa weren't as crippled as they are today
<homerj>	the one to get was the sb live!
<homerj>	the emu10k
<bougyman>	yep, emu10k was great with alsa or oss.
<homerj>	that was the one card that really did hardware mixing
<bougyman>	didn't need anything on top of it.
<sudokode>	conglomerations. that's the name of the game
<godginrai>	sudokode: food supply is all kinds of f'ed up, tho'
<homerj>	a $100 soundcard
<sudokode>	homerj: not really
<sudokode>	i got one
<bougyman>	i had the one with the external mixing box.
<bougyman>	it was $200
<homerj>	they were back then
<sudokode>	well, sb audigy2 zs
<sudokode>	i think it was $50 back in the day
<bougyman>	but i was doing studio recording with it.
<sudokode>	still using it
<homerj>	sudokode, na, they were more than that
<sudokode>	nah
<homerj>	late 90s
<saivert>	i still have creative audigy 2 zs card. it works fine in linux
<sudokode>	i think i got mine around... 2004ish
<homerj>	i think i had it the same time as my voodoo 3
<saivert>	i'm willing to sell it
<sudokode>	i had a radeon 9200 back then
<saivert>	is there a arch marketplace channel? so we can trade old hw
<sudokode>	i have that card and i'm still using pulse :d
<sudokode>	i don't even remember how i ended up on pulse but whatever
<homerj>	the nice thing about pulse now, is that if i plug in my usb headset
<homerj>	things actually can flip over to use it
<houn>	quick clarification: i'm installing, never dealt with uefi before.  the esp partition that i created is supposed to be mounted to /boot, right?
<homerj>	not a pain to do something like have a game over speakers, and mumble over the headset
<sheep>	houn: it can be mounted there
<houn>	can, should, must?
<sudokode>	houn: if you're using it as your boot partition as well
<sheep>	houn: should
<ingar>	homerj: that would suck, as my usn headset is plugged in most of the time, but i mostly use speakers
<sudokode>	if you have a separate /boot filesystem, then you'd mount the esp to /boot/efi
<sudokode>	if it's one filesystem, then just /boot
<sheep>	houn: you can mount it wherever you like, but most arch users put it on /boot
<houn>	ok
<saivert>	only because that is the easiest way for the kernel to be installed to the esp
<sudokode>	you don't install the kernel to the esp
<saivert>	you can
<sudokode>	or you don't have to anyway
<saivert>	i do it that way
<houn>	so, i must have missed that call out earlier in the install guide / beginners guide, so i created a separate partition for /boot, because habit.
<grawity>	sudokode: most bootloaders, other than grub, will want you to
<sudokode>	grawity: what, put it in /boot/efi?
<godginrai>	saivert: it should be called #arch-wts
<grawity>	sudokode: yes
<sudokode>	i've never had a bootloader tell me to do that
<sudokode>	if grub does, that's probably why i don't use it
<houn>	so i either go back and repartition everything, or mount sda2 to /boot and sda1 to /boot/efi?
<grawity>	sudokode: *other than* grub
<homerj>	i have an old 100m network card
<sudokode>	grawity: never seen that in my life
<saivert>	sudokode: so how do you boot linux then?
<grawity>	sudokode: maybe your /boot is already the esp then
<saivert>	what bootloader?
<sudokode>	grawity: yes, that's what i'm saying
<sudokode>	if you use one filesystem
<grawity>	sudokode: you're saying "19:28 (sudokode) you don't install the kernel to the esp"
<saivert>	yes. that is same as my setup. /boot *is* the esp
<sudokode>	[12:28:52]     sudokode | or you don't have to anyway
<grawity>	the "efi" subdirectory isn't the esp; the whole partition is the esp
<sudokode>	yes
<sudokode>	but if you mount your esp to /boot/efi, you still don't have to put the kernel in /boot/efi
<grawity>	you do
<saivert>	*sigh* we have gone full circle allready
<sudokode>	grawity: why would you?
<sudokode>	uefi doesn't need the kernel. it needs the bootloader efi binary
<grawity>	sudokode: because bootloaders other than grub will not be able to read the kernel from a filesystem that's not the esp
<sudokode>	once that runs, it can read other filesystems
<saivert>	grub's efi bootloader is capable of reading ext, btrfs etc. so it can load the kernel from whatever.
<grawity>	grub is the only one that has drivers for ext4, etc.
<sudokode>	wat
<grawity>	gummiboot, for example, uses the native uefi file access apis
<scimmia>	sudokode, only if you use grub, and who wants that crap?
<sudokode>	grub has everything
<houn>	...ok, frak it, starting over and repartitioning
<houn>	too confusing right this second to be creative
<saivert>	if you use gummiboot, and don't use a ext/btrfs efi kernel driver you need the kernel to be on the esp along with the initramfs
<sudokode>	so no other uefi bootloader can read filesystems other than fat?
<sudokode>	aside from grub
<grawity>	so it can access only what uefi itself can access, and while technically it probably *could* open other partitions, you'd *still* be limited to what filesystems uefi itself supports
<scimmia>	sudokode, many/most won't read other partitions, regardless of the fs
<sudokode>	well nvm then
<saivert>	but you have always use grub. so continue with that. you don't have to know all this shit that way
<saivert>	grub fixes everything
<grawity>	it's possible that syslinux-efi also has ext* support, working similarly to syslinux-bios
<grawity>	but i have not checked
<dunp>	how about coreboot "bios"?
<scimmia>	with the stub loader as stable as it's become, why would you want a full bootloader on uefi?
<saivert>	i currently use grub too only because i had some weird issues with refind where the kernel sometimes isn't able to find the root devices even though everything should be ok. it might have been refind or the efistub that is broken.

<namarrgon>	where do you have space?

<godginrai>	bushido_: sed
<godginrai>	bushido_: or awk
<bushido_>	godginrai: how i remove the sed ''?
<godginrai>	bushido_: ?  you're going to have to speak more clearly for me to answer that
<bushido_>	godginrai: i have the line ' some text on file' * 100 i want to remove the 'word' from the text
<godginrai>	bushido_: which word?  try putting the input file on a pastebin (like ix.io) and an example of what you want your result to look like.
<sjums>	bushido_: you probably want to look into sed
<godginrai>	sjums: i already suggested both sed and awk
<earnestly>	(if you're going to need awk, awk can do all of that)
<untitaker>	hello, i have a problem with mutt: it prompts for pgp passphrases even though not necessary, but: i can type in random nonsense, then it seems to use the agent correctly. from googling it seems this particular behavior is quite unique, anybody knows what i'm doing wrong?

<octocpp>	what is that thing you can do to make the wording colorized in console when searching in pacman, and also that pacman eye candy heh?
<sheep>	octocpp: an option in pacman.conf
<octocpp>	is there a page that talkes about console candy options?
<sheep>	man pacman.conf
<earnestly>	nope ;p
<octocpp>	sheep: thanks, also, i really liked the way the man page was lit up in the bootable archiso, was that something in /etc/profile?
<earnestly>	octocpp: it's not documented
<sheep>	i don't remember
<earnestly>	octocpp: that's just less colours
<sheep>	i haven't used archiso for more than like 5 minutes since 2011
<earnestly>	octocpp: e.g. http://ix.io/img
<sjums>	bushido_: use that command with sed. `sed -i.bak 's/some//g' file.txt`
<octocpp>	i just loaded arch through pxe on a poweredge i got.

<dan39>	what is good alternative for managing haskell packages? instead of pacman..
<jupelius>	half-life musix rox
<earnestly>	dan39: cabal is the only one and it sucks
<dan39>	o
<dan39>	:|
<octocpp>	earnestly: wow that config is huge. i see the less statments in there.
<earnestly>	and ghc-pkg --user unregister
<dan39>	so just go with the arch packages?
<bougyman>	how's nix with haskell package management?
<earnestly>	octocpp: yeah, it's pretty bad
<earnestly>	bougyman: also sucks
<earnestly>	bougyman: but you get less hell though
<earnestly>	why can't these languages just be friendly to unix-like systems and even windows?  idk
<dan39>	the warnings i get when upgrading haskell stuff annoys me :p
<bougyman>	earnestly: we're in the process of rewriting our package manager to offer nix-like package encapsulation.
<earnestly>	maybe because they're older than linux
<earnestly>	but python is so friendly in comparison
<bougyman>	so that you have one set of 'system' packages, and have have any number of self-contained package overlays.
<earnestly>	bougyman: why not just use ostree?
<bougyman>	should allow for a lot more flexibility.
<earnestly>	or nih?
<polyzen>	haskell is older than linux?
<earnestly>	polyzen: yeah, but only just
<earnestly>	polyzen: it's a year older
<earnestly>	but then haskell's legacy is much older still like clean and miranda
<bougyman>	earnestly: it's big, for one, and doesn't support overlays yet.
<bougyman>	well, they have prototypes for layering packages.
<bougyman>	but that's really the only piece we want, not the whole ostree.
<homerj>	i'd love to know why kde 5.3 when i start up, kwin crashes once, then it's fine
<homerj>	just kind of freezes for a second "kwin has been restarted due to graphics reset"
<earnestly>	polyzen: but even rust is anti-linux/unix as well and it's annoying
<earnestly>	polyzen: makefiles work beautifully with rust, cargo is a crapfest
<polyzen>	earnestly, isn't "anti" a bit much? :p
<homerj>	something that will be fixed eventually probably
<earnestly>	polyzen: no
<earnestly>	polyzen: they literally make packaging rust the most painful thing ever
<earnestly>	polyzen: they don't even have common search paths
<polyzen>	:\
<bougyman>	nim has a refreshingly nice packaging system.
<polyzen>	common search paths?
<sheep>	i don't like nim's syntax
<earnestly>	polyzen: /usr/lib, such as /usr/lib/rust could be a good candidate
<polyzen>	ah
<earnestly>	bougyman: look into ponylang, it's kind of unexpected
<earnestly>	polyzen: contrast that with python, which is extremely friendly to package
<earnestly>	polyzen: rust also unfortunately decided to go with the "version pinning" mechanism to deal with distributed packaging, which is also a pain, just like hackage
<crazedpsyc>	of course, you *could* submit an issue or even a pull request, since it's a newish open source project
<earnestly>	crazedpsyc: what, rust?
<crazedpsyc>	yes
<earnestly>	haha
<earnestly>	good luck with that
<earnestly>	maybe the next time it'll work
<jelle>	ohsnap
<earnestly>	these people don't even understand why anyone would need the xdg basedir spec
<jelle>	lol
<polyzen>	safe to assume version pinning is depending on exact versions of other software?
<earnestly>	polyzen: it ends up that way
<drbig>	anyone here for some polish *szanty* in the background? (http://radio.drbig.one.pl:8000/kaermpd.m3u)
<hexhaxtron>	is it possible to run several wms simultaneously? i wanted to try other wms without logging off.
<drbig>	hexhaxtron: not at once
<jelle>	hexhaxtron: it is
<pmted>	anyone have any experience with arch on the surface pro 2? looked around a bit, but all i can seem to find is old posts and articles about all the problems with that combination. has there been any improvements in the last year for a native install of arch on the sp2?
<godginrai>	drbig: maybe if i knew what it was :p
<jelle>	hexhaxtron: totally forgot how you could nest it
<drbig>	jelle: is it?
<earnestly>	polyzen: since versions rely on human intervention, many won't bump major on api change because major bumps have some emotional attachment, but some depend on specific versions when the api doesn't change and it ends up being just a big mess

<drbig>	jelle: you'd be running one wm normally anyway so try them as such
<earnestly>	when they don't realise maintainers are pretty much the users last line of defense
<earnestly>	it's a pretty beautiful system only made worse by bad software.  that's literally the only problem with it.  unless you also think that maintainers are bad and upstream should have the final word all the time, which might be a valid point
<cloudef>	earnestly: i agree
<cloudef>	earnestly: the only reason people really hate maintainers is because they don't have control. it's not because the system is better, it's not
<earnestly>	"bypass maintainers, just install this random tarball which contains the entire ubuntu /lib tree \o/"
<earnestly>	-- super hexagon
<cloudef>	the system is worse. best things come when upstream and packager work together

<jupelius>	or where is the but
<polyzen>	not
<earnestly>	jupelius: i thought it was a joke, but then they have a mechanical proof of the type system and i got performance almost equal to some of the best c++ on shootout, for a gc'd language. :|
<earnestly>	jupelius: so i packaged it, i made some issue reports about respecting /usr/lib/pony, which they might do
<earnestly>	their makefile is a bit of a mess atm

<zako>	hi
<earnestly>	actors are basically threads, but the capabilities allow them to assume certain things like mutability, read-only sharing, etc.

<earnestly>	abara: and you can be confident in knowing they are correct.  a lot of stuff on the web is terrible when it comes to shell unfortunately :/
<earnestly>	hexhaxtron: why are you using xnest instead of xephyr?
<godginrai>	drbig: not bad
<abara>	yeah but i'am not intent to be fluent right now, just need to know why the the $name is not being updated after the changing
<abara>	thanks you all for the links :)
<earnestly>	abara: well, the echo obviously wouldn't work as you think, it'd just print the string literal "text1"
<hexhaxtron>	earnestly, i'll try xephyr.
<earnestly>	hexhaxtron: xnest has been dead for the last 300 years
<braindamage>	before it was even concieved!
<earnestly>	abara: you first assign the variable 'name' to the string "nobody", then you assign the variable 'text1' to the string " hello i\'am $name" which is first expanded to " hello i\'am nobody" and then assigned to 'text1'

<earnestly>	abara: see my version, which is actually bash.
<earnestly>	abara: your code is wrong on a few levels
<earnestly>	that is using [, not quoting $1 in the assignment, using echo, etc.
<earnestly>	it will also suffer from, as you've seen, toctou races

<drbig>	godginrai: at least i can guarantee it's the better side music-wise ;)
<earnestly>	mar77i: also your license directory is wrong
<mar77i>	i don't fetch a specific release, so i have that going for me.
<earnestly>	mar77i: here http://ix.io/imo
<godginrai>	drbig: well, it's been decent so far ;)
<earnestly>	simple
<earnestly>	no need to abuse bash for pkgbuilds
<drbig>	godginrai: you speak polish?
<teraflop>	sorry my ignorance but what is that 78 group? i see in a diff of qemu.conf.pacnew
<earnestly>	"just because you can, doesn't mean you should" kind of deal
<earnestly>	teraflop: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/developerwiki:uid_/_gid_database
<phrik>	title: developerwiki:uid / gid database - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<teraflop>	earnestly: thanks
<earnestly>	teraflop:  kvm 78
<godginrai>	drbig: not at all.  but i appreciate music no matter the language
<mar77i>	earnestly: wtf is that?
<drbig>	godginrai: aye, just wondering. i do speak polish but i rarely put on polish music
<earnestly>	mar77i: you can also just use git://github, for github repos
<earnestly>	mar77i: also you don't need to depend on curl
<mar77i>	earnestly: i'm pretty sure i need auth for that
<teraflop>	ah i see earnestly i already have kvm in qemu.conf but i added by hand
<bougyman>	earnestly: neat stuff.
<earnestly>	mar77i: need auth for what?
<bougyman>	pony reminds me a lot of joule/e
<grazzolini>	teraflop: you don't need to
<earnestly>	bougyman: it is inspired by such
<grazzolini>	teraflop: it already runs as nobody:kvm
<bougyman>	removing null was fucking bold.
<mar77i>	earnestly: the git://github.com urls need auth
<bougyman>	i like it.
<earnestly>	mar77i: nope :d
<bougyman>	earnestly: have you used pony at all?
<gehidore>	!pony
<phrik>	peng
<earnestly>	mar77i: the only problem with using git:// is that some workplace proxies don't like it
<mar77i>	earnestly: don't nope me. it's bugged me.
<bougyman>	i'm wondering how much the 'every field has to have a value' thing hits someone on a normal basis.
<teraflop>	grazzolini: since when? since i had to add my user to kvm and set group to kvm in order to run libvirtd as user
<bougyman>	i'd bet the answer is "a lot" until one gets used to it.
<earnestly>	mar77i: you don't need auth to clone a git://github repo
<mar77i>	earnestly: also the stuff i install makes use of the curl binary.
<mar77i>	so curl must be depended on.
<earnestly>	keenerd: refresh my memory.  base is assumed for depends, base-devel is assumed for makedepends, how did it work again?
<grazzolini>	teraflop: why are you running it as user?
<mar77i>	curl isn't in a group
<teraflop>	grazzolini: why not?
<mar77i>	...here.
<earnestly>	mar77i: curl is in base, since pacman depends on it
<grazzolini>	teraflop: limits?
<earnestly>	mar77i: as a dependency, it's funny.
<grazzolini>	teraflop: anyway
<teraflop>	grazzolini: i dont see the point of running as root
<bougyman>	earnestly: anyone commercial behind pony?
<earnestly>	mar77i: but i might be missremebering it
<bougyman>	looks like: "no"
<teraflop>	it*
<earnestly>	bougyman: just their company
<bougyman>	which means it'll die a fine academic death, like e and joule before it.
<earnestly>	bougyman: did e try to be anything more than academic?
<mar77i>	earnestly: that is totally superficial.
<bougyman>	earnestly: heck yeah!
<bougyman>	they developed it as an alternative electric grid software language!
<mar77i>	don't force your twists on people.
<bougyman>	it had grand commercial designs.
<grazzolini>	teraflop: you can run as user. but networking will be a pita for you. macvtap comes to mind
<earnestly>	mar77i: what is your problem?
<bougyman>	joule was solely academic, iir.
<bougyman>	*iirc
<hexhaxtron>	i'm having a problem with the login. i do the login and then it hangs for a long time until it asks me to login again. i discovered that doing the login and ctrl + c gives me the prompt. what's wrong with this?
<teraflop>	grazzolini: i have no issue at all with networks, even using tap directly in qemu as user too
<mar77i>	i wanted to get a beer... after this.
<earnestly>	bougyman: we'll see.  i don't think it'll do much either
<teraflop>	grazzolini: i mean with a custom tap network script
<earnestly>	bougyman: but it's interesting either way and they've made some headway.  i have a pony-git if you want
<grazzolini>	teraflop: you're worried about security?
<earnestly>	bougyman: right now to build you have to use `-p /usr/lib/pony`.  i'm hoping this issue#172 will get fixed
<teraflop>	grazzolini: not at all
<grazzolini>	teraflop: so why you want to run libvirtd as user?
<drbig>	godginrai: are you still listening?
<earnestly>	bougyman: and i just hope it doesn't nih too much
<bougyman>	earnestly: i'm packaging it for void as we speak.
<teraflop>	grazzolini: heh i really do not get your point
<godginrai>	drbig: was, but it cut out.
<mar77i>	also pacman works fine with any dlagent whatsoever.
<bougyman>	i like how actor interaction and language definition are in the same place.
<drbig>	godginrai: my upload is puny sorry; should work though
<mar77i>	and factually doesn't depend on curl
<bougyman>	that was always really funky with e, though i understood why they did it.
<grazzolini>	teraflop: libvirtd runs as root for convenience. all qemu machines are spawned as nobody:kvm.
<teraflop>	grazzolini: but what convenience?
<earnestly>	bougyman: you can see my pkgbuild.  their `make install` system isn't very good (hardcodes /usr/local or forces you to install it to prefix or if you use destdir, tries to use symlinks to /usr/local and it'll mess up fakeroot obviously)
<mar77i>	oh wait, it does
<mar77i>	okay you got that much right.
<teraflop>	grazzolini: sorry my  ignorance i never had a single issue running as user
<earnestly>	bougyman: the .install just informs about using `-p /usr/lib/pony` and includes links to an emacs mode and vim syntax
<godginrai>	drbig: reopened the link and it seems to have started up again
<drbig>	godginrai: yeah, i think i see you
<earnestly>	bougyman: they did add all the debug compiler options to the release build, so that's nice \o/
<mar77i>	i'll get back to this tomorrow. or whenever i have the nerve...
<earnestly>	bougyman: so now you get all of these http://ix.io/imp in the release build.  they do use gcc -o3 though which is a bit concerning
<grazzolini>	teraflop:http://wiki.libvirt.org/page/faq#what_is_the_difference_between_qemu:.2f.2f.2fsystem_and_qemu:.2f.2f.2fsession.3f_which_one_should_i_use.3f
<bougyman>	earnestly: does the compiler just make c then compile/link it?
<phrik>	title: libvirt: wiki: faq (at wiki.libvirt.org)
<earnestly>	bougyman: i'm not sure
<earnestly>	bougyman: i believe it does
<bougyman>	that's what nim does, too.
<bougyman>	i think it's a good model.
<earnestly>	bougyman: a lot of languages do that
<bougyman>	rms would approve.
<earnestly>	it's not a bad idea, but eh.
<earnestly>	well
<bougyman>	"don't write code, write code which writes code"
<earnestly>	no, it does use llvm
<earnestly>	so i don't know how that factors it.  it uses a very recent llvm 3.7 on windows as well
<earnestly>	bougyman: only supports x86_64 atm
<bougyman>	pony, you mean?
<bougyman>	oh that sucks.
<earnestly>	yes
<bougyman>	i've been moving to aarch64 where i can.
<earnestly>	bougyman: it's very, very new.  rust took 5 years before people knew about it
<bougyman>	datacentered just opened up an aarch64 hosting site, really nice.
<jones_>	hey, im trying to install arch on my desktop. when i do pacstrap /mnt base base-devel, i get five packages where is says 'signature from xx is unknown trust', and xx.pkg is corrupted. i've tried to delete the whole '/mnt/var/cache/pacman/pkg' folder, set the time with 'ntpd 'qg' and 'hwclock -w', also 'pacman-key --init' and 'pacman-key --populate archlinux'
<earnestly>	bougyman: they have a channel on freenode, #ponylang, fwiw
<drbig>	godginrai: i guess my own music would also fall under 'polish' ;d
<demize>	with llvm you basically just programmatically generate the ir using their apis and then let llvm do the rest.
<earnestly>	bougyman: i don't see it going far but it's interesting
<bougyman>	earnestly: did i tell you we added musl, too?
<godginrai>	;)
<earnestly>	bougyman: musl is relevant because?
<bougyman>	just yesterday finished building the musl repos (for x86 and x86_64)
<namarrgon>	jones_: "pacman -sy archlinux-keyring" then try again
<bougyman>	earnestly: you don't like musl or ??
<teraflop>	grazzolini: you mean launch the libvirtd.service as user(which i dont)? i just meant launching virt-manager as user or doing qemu-system-x86_64 as user too
<earnestly>	bougyman: i'm just wondering how it popped in
<earnestly>	it's a nice libc, bad allocator, but then they all are
<earnestly>	except if you use jemalloc
<bougyman>	earnestly: oh, just about arch's in general.
<bougyman>	that's the only way adding musl made sense to us, it's its own architecture.
<bougyman>	probably not the ideal solution, but works.
<grazzolini>	teraflop: i was talking about libvirtd, yes. launching qemu-system-x86-64 as user is not recommended. it already runs as nobody
<drbig>	godginrai: next one is mine, feel free to tell me how much it sucks :)
<grazzolini>	teraflop: virt-manager as user is simple as adding your user to the libvirt group
<jones_>	@namarrgon, that did the trick, thanks! i wonder why that didn't come up in any of the threads on this issue i found
<godginrai>	drbig: lol, sure thing :p
<teraflop>	grazzolini: ah good, not my case, about qemu-system-x86-64 ill read in deep, thanks for the advice
<grazzolini>	teraflop: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/libvirt#using_polkit
<phrik>	title: libvirt - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<namarrgon>	jones_: it just not needed very often, 'pacman-key --refresh-keys' might have worked as well
<grazzolini>	teraflop: i use this. hadn't to change a single line of the libvirt.conf file. just created this polkit rule, added myself to libvirt and moved on
<earnestly>	namarrgon: do you know how these issues happen in the first place?  you seem pretty good at solving key issues atm
<jones_>	curious about this as well
<namarrgon>	earnestly: iirc someone's key expired right after the iso was released
<teraflop>	grazzolini: oh im on the wheel group and it never worked for me, definitely ill dig into that
<earnestly>	namarrgon: oh
<godginrai>	drbig: it cut off again?
<drbig>	godginrai: reopen
<tongcx>	hi guys, can you recommend some gui text editor, just want to use it for pasting code
<earnestly>	bougyman: i actually tend to shy away from any language which toutes a package manager as a feature
<earnestly>	bougyman: i don't mind them providing a way for people to find packages, like python, but package managers almost always mean headaches
<earnestly>	s/almost//
<godginrai>	drbig: every couple of seconds, the sound chops out, as if to buffer.  pretty sure that's not part of the song :p
<drbig>	godginrai: might be a problem between you and me, my adsl ain't amazon
<godginrai>	drbig: could be
<godginrai>	drbig: it's more stable now
<earnestly>	"things like librarian-puppet, which is, itself, a customization of a piece of software called librarian, which is a framework to manage bundlers, which is something that manages ruby dependencies (pulling down the software you need to run the things that you have)." lolwat
<drbig>	godginrai: also that's my tune now :)
<earnestly>	"there is also librarian-chef. this is separate from berkshelf, of course, which does pretty much the same thing. "
<godginrai>	drbig: not bad
<drbig>	well, was
<drbig>	i'll play it again after this little gem
<teraflop>	oh he left, i wanted to ask him why they added the kvm group now in lates qemu? that is what i was doing before

<darkelement>	hey guys trying to install newest archlinux on vmware workstation, however it won't start because i don't have enough cpu's apparently
<darkelement>	using the 2015 iso
<earnestly>	i should read the bourne books
<mrelendig>	darkelement: contact vmware customer support
<darkelement>	:|
<darkelement>	i'm downloading this on windows(with vmware) does that make a difference?
<darkelement>	i notice many of the tutorials have linux commands
<mirc32>	i pooped my pants
<mirc32>	im using windows xp
<darkelement>	so do you guys know of a good tutorial for installing archlinux onto vmware workstation
<demize>	mirc32: we do not care.
<mirc32>	no do u
<kilo`byte>	guess nobody has an idea... will have to post on forum tomorrow then...
<mar77i>	earnestly: could you show me the git:// way of fetching from github? i can't figure it out. i believe it's because github requires me to identify as user by public key.
<darkelement>	got it working, never mind
<drbig>	godginrai: playing quality .pl hip-hop ;)
<earnestly>	mar77i: any of my pkgbuilds can be seen as example: https://github.com/earnestly/pkgbuilds (i have another 100 not in the repo)
<phrik>	title: earnestly/pkgbuilds · github (at github.com)
<mrelendig>	mar77i: just use https for cloning
<godginrai>	drbig: the hiphop just cut out :p
<gehidore>	mar77i: git clone ....
<mar77i>	earnestly: where did you not use https?
<earnestly>	in all cases
<drbig>	godginrai: keep it on repeat
<mar77i>	heh
<drbig>	godginrai: unless you have a node for multiplxing it won't be better :/
<godginrai>	drbig: i'm probably gonna stop listening for now.  gonna switch to some ar tonelico to get in the groove for coding.
<drbig>	aye
<drbig>	anyways
<drbig>	http://radio.drbig.one.pl:8000/kaermpd.m3u it's open :)
<earnestly>	mar77i: except the gvim-hg package as that's the only non-git package besides vte3-select-text
<darkelement>	ok so i'm at the archiso login: root(automatic login). what do i do from here guys?
<mrelendig>	!give darkelement install
<phrik>	darkelement: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide
<sudokode>	that's where the magic happens
<darkelement>	but i'm doing this on vmware
<mar77i>	stop making me want to beat you up.
<mar77i>	or myself.
<sudokode>	it's pretty much the same thing
<darkelement>	alrighty
<sudokode>	!wiki install in vmware
<phrik>	sudokode: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/vmware

<sudokode>	yes
<sudokode>	that's extra stuff you might need to know to install on vmware
<darkelement>	yea, but what commands do i do at this screen
<sudokode>	a lot of them
<sudokode>	if you're brand new
<sudokode>	!beginner
<darkelement>	alright
<sudokode>	!beginners
<phrik>	read this! all of it, twice! your answer is probably here! http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/beginners%27_guide
<earnestly>	darkelement: it only changes when you start doing graphical things
<wasamasa>	read the installation guide
<darkelement>	alright
<earnestly>	beginners guide isn't so good
<amstan>	earnestly: so you say i should make a bug report regarding the license thing?
<sudokode>	the arch install is fully command-driven though
<earnestly>	amstan: yep
<sudokode>	license thing?
<sudokode>	sounds fun
<darkelement>	didnt' expect this, the actual os lol
<earnestly>	amstan: as i said before, since you have a credible reason to do so
<earnestly>	sudokode: pkgbuilds not having a license
<sudokode>	ah
<sudokode>	wait, you mean for the package itself or the pkgbuild itself?
<amstan>	sudokode: pkgbuilds
<sudokode>	ah yes. i remember this discussion
<amstan>	earnestly: where are they stored btw? for archlinuxarm it's just that github repo, but i'm a little lost for arch
<earnestly>	amstan: projects.archlinux.org
<sudokode>	afaik, they're only covered under local copyright laws (and for fuck's sake, that may even depend on where they're hosted) since they haven't been licensed
<earnestly>	!give amstan bugs
<phrik>	amstan: bugs?! arch linux has no bugs! oh.. wait.. https://bugs.archlinux.org
<sudokode>	amstan: arch has an svn2git thing or something
<sudokode>	it's weird
<sudokode>	!package linux
<phrik>	https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?q=linux
<earnestly>	well, it was before git existed and they could have picked cvs
<sudokode>	pretty much all right there though
<earnestly>	svn was around, it was better
<sudokode>	yeah
<amstan>	there's a source files button right on that page, *facepalm* https://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/tree/trunk?h=packages/linux
<phrik>	title: svntogit/packages.git - git clone of the 'packages' repository (at projects.archlinux.org)
<earnestly>	amstan: those are the core/extra packages
<sudokode>	heh
<earnestly>	amstan: the community packages are in community.git
<keenerd>	earnestly: base is usually assumed for depends, with some discresion (like for making rebuilds obvious).  base-devel always assumed for makedeps.
<darkelement>	what is inst-image.iso supposed to be?
<earnestly>	keenerd: yeah, i'm a little vague on how to handle depends in regard to base sometimes
<mrelendig>	darkelement: the name of the iso you have?
<mrelendig>	darkelement: where are you seeing that?
<darkelement>	tried that, couldnt open it
<earnestly>	keenerd: but i can probably understand what you mean about making certain dependencies explicit for the build and even user
<earnestly>	keenerd: that said, namcap will warn for dependencies such as gcc-libs
<darkelement>	in the install guide
<earnestly>	darkelement: the installation iso is what you downloaded and ran in vmware which yeilded the root prompt
<darkelement>	it didnt find it rather
<mrelendig>	darkelement: you said you already booted to the install image
<mrelendig>	so what is the problem?
<sudokode>	earnestly: i'd say if it's in base but the package specifically depends on that thing, especially if it's something that could easily be uninstalled (explicit packages), then put it in depends
<teraflop>	amstan: youre talking about the chromebook pkgbuild you did?
<darkelement>	mrelendig: oh, do i not even need to execute that command
<keenerd>	earnestly: warnings are ust warnings.  it means "requires the decision making of a human".
<earnestly>	keenerd: oh that's fine
<th0rne>	anyone here use mpsyt? it's stopped working for me.
<mrelendig>	darkelement: clearly not since you have already booted the iso
<sudokode>	warning: this may be an error. call a human
<darkelement>	mrelendig: sorry ^_^
<earnestly>	keenerd: but yeah, okay.  i can work with that, it is pretty much what i've been doing but the use of base regarding depends was unclear.  thanks
<th0rne>	anyone know any other tui youtube programs?
<sysgh0st>	human here. what is the problem? ;)
<mrelendig>	th0rne: mpv
<th0rne>	with search, preferablhy.
<th0rne>	*preferably
<darkelement>	how do you guys recommend i partition my drive?
<th0rne>	200 mb boot and 40 gb root?
<mrelendig>	20-30gib /, /boot if needed and the rest for /home
<namarrgon>	darkelement: the beginners' guide is worth a look
<mrelendig>	btrfs all the things
<sysgh0st>	darkelement: if you have no special needs. root and perhaps a swap.
<amstan>	teraflop: yes
<mrelendig>	or btrfs all the things*
<teraflop>	amstan: damn, id love to see that pkgbuild
<mrelendig>	!give darkelement yt google btrfs 2015
<phrik>	darkelement: why you should consider using btrfs ... like google does. - youtube: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dplcprqjva>
<amstan>	teraflop: it's not that special though
<amstan>	teraflop: just whatever it was with minor modifications
<amstan>	teraflop: i can explain it and anyone else would be able to do the same..
<beest>	may finally dump fx/penta, is there one chrome extension i should use over another coming from penta?
<teraflop>	amstan: oh, i wish you can share that pkgbuild the proper way then
<braindamage>	beest: cvim
<beest>	forgot about cvim entirely
<teraflop>	mrelendig: i mean through the aur (excuse my crappy english)
<teraflop>	s/mrelendig/amstan
<amstan>	teraflop: any way i share this code has to be aproved by my employer(google) and they won't sign off on things that are not open source
<teraflop>	^
<mrelendig>	amstan: not if you do it on your free time
<amstan>	mrelendig: how can i claim it's on my free time if i used knowlege from my job and hardware available to me through my job
<mrelendig>	amstan: lunch break
<mrelendig>	:p
<mrelendig>	why would you not make it open source though?
<teraflop>	hah
<sudokode>	earnestly: pacman -sgq base | expac '%n %n' - | awk '$2 {print $1}'
<sudokode>	that's probably the best approximation of what you can expect to be installed via base
<sudokode>	reverse that...  pacman -sgq base | expac '%n %n' - | awk '!$2 {print $1}'
<sudokode>	you get packages that could be uninstalled after installing base
<keenerd>	amstan: describe the package vaguely to someone, and get them to do a clean room reimplementation and they give it a license, upload it to the aur, and let you maintain it.
<amstan>	keenerd: i can't maintain it either
<keenerd>	?
<amstan>	keenerd: it's still releasing google's property in theory
<teraflop>	amstan: sell it to me, that chromebook with that package installed :p
<keenerd>	amstan: okay, fine.  assuming it is a pkgbuild for an existing piece of software, share the name of the hypothetical package.  that is pretty much all someone needs to do a reimplementation and it wold be pretty hard to claim someone else's name as google property.
<amstan>	teraflop: google would have to sell it
<ldk>	teraflop: are you dutch by any chance?
<sudokode>	earnestly: then again, if someone only uses xfs and doesn't want e2fsprogs, they could probably get rid of it
<teraflop>	ldk: nope, spain
<sudokode>	not easily though since libldap is required by sudo

<mrelendig>	!give sagerdearia aur
<phrik>	sagerdearia: the trasheap of arch. dig around enough and you might just find some gold. https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/aur
<teraflop>	ldk: heh thanks for being so kind, i know my english is a piece of junk
<amstan>	keenerd: similar to https://github.com/archlinuxarm/pkgbuilds/tree/master/core/linux-chromebook2
<sagerdearia>	mrelendig, that is not the original tuxedo-wmi. it's reply to http://forum.notebookreview.com/threads/sager-np9752-special-clevo-p750zm-linux-backlit-keyboard-driver.775306/#post-9998485

<ldk>	teraflop: it is not. have confidence! :)
<sysgh0st>	the trasheap. that should be it's official name ;)
<sysgh0st>	its*
<mrelendig>	sagerdearia: then write your own pkgbuild
<keenerd>	amstan: the state of licensing on arch's stuff is moot.  if you based it on that then you only need to ask leming to slap a gpl on the top.
<amstan>	keenerd: he claims that he can't
<mrelendig>	i should agplv3 all my pkgbuilds in aur
<leming>	i'd just as soon state them as public domain, why bother with a license
<sysgh0st>	need a quick way to list all users currently running x.org (i have a multiseat system where multible users run their own x instance )
<sheep>	pgrep -a x?
<sheep>	wait no.  that doesn't list the uid
<hwkiller>	does makepkg inherit from the environment? as in, if i exported a variable in my terminal, then ran makepkg that references that variable, would it use the exported variable?
<hwkiller>	er, ran makepkg on a pkgbuild that references the exported variable*
<earnestly>	sheep: -u $uid would kind of work :p
<sheep>	sysgh0st: maybe 'ps -c xorg u'
<mrelendig>	hwkiller: makepkg is just a bash script
<hwkiller>	mrelendig: so yes?
<mrelendig>	yes
<earnestly>	sheep: ps -fc xorg
<hwkiller>	thanks
<sagerdearia>	ah, i needed to install linux-headers, mrelendig o/
<amstan>	leming: what's the canonical project name? arch linux arm, alarm, archlinuxarm?
<sheep>	or that
<mrelendig>	hwkiller: that why setting cc=whatever makepkg works
<mrelendig>	etc
<leming>	amstan, the first
<ipsilon>	i was playing around with systemd-analyzer blame. is there something that can be done in the firmware/kernel steps without recompiling?
<earnestly>	sheep: idk, i stick with the linux command-line options instead of bsd, but either work
<mrelendig>	ipsilon: yes, buy new hardware
<ipsilon>	ok
<sysgh0st>	sheep, mrelendig: thanks. should have thought of that before. guess i got lazy again ;)
<earnestly>	sheep: you may need a for it though to lift the user only thing
<sheep>	earnestly: i used freebsd before linux so that's what i was used to
<mrelendig>	ipsilon: or replace the firmware on your mobo
<teraflop>	ipsilon: you men for speedup the boot?
<teraflop>	mean*
<ipsilon>	it's a laptop :p. i was mostly wondering if for normal users it is worth learning what is going on there.
<ipsilon>	boot speed is one factor
<ipsilon>	it's already fast enough
<ipsilon>	ssd and all
<darkelement>	mrelendig: what do i need to do or read in order to partition the drive with btrfs
<mrelendig>	darkelement: make partition, mkfs.btrfs .....
<mrelendig>	!wiki btrfs
<phrik>	mrelendig: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/btrfs
<earnestly>	darkelement: open up fstab, press 'h' and play around with it :p
<amstan>	leming, earnestly: https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/44893
<darkelement>	how do i open up fstap
<phrik>	title: fs#44893 : licensing for the archlinux repositories (at bugs.archlinux.org)
<earnestly>	darkelement: changes are only written when you actually write to it
<darkelement>	sorry i am so new to arch
<amstan>	leming: should i make a similar one for archlinuxarm?
<earnestly>	darkelement: sorry, not fstab, fdisk
<mrelendig>	use gdisk btw
<earnestly>	darkelement: no, this is linux
<earnestly>	mrelendig: fdisk is fine now
<mrelendig>	since you are only going to run arch anyway
<earnestly>	mrelendig: which is nice
<darkelement>	im confused
<earnestly>	!give darkelement fundamentals
<phrik>	darkelement: http://www.funtoo.org/linux_fundamentals,_part_1
<leming>	amstan, creating an issue on our tracker is just going to annoy me
<darkelement>	i just want to get arch set up for now, i've used a bit of manjaro and have used ubuntu
<amstan>	leming: ok, np
<earnestly>	amstan: nice, thanks.  let's hope it goes somewhere
<darkelement>	what are the commands i can do to do this. that's all i want for now
<amstan>	leming: another alternative i considered is to make my own repo, rewrite pkgbuilds that i wish to modify in a clean room
<sheep>	darkelement: fdisk and mkfs.btrfs
<amstan>	leming: and somehow get binaries...
<amstan>	leming: but that sounds like a lot of work
<leming>	or just do it all on your own time, and fuck all the dumb shit
<sheep>	darkelement: the wiki should have a page somewhere on how to use fdisk or another tool to edit partitions
<darkelement>	sheep: what partitions should i make
<sheep>	darkelement: whatever you want
<earnestly>	darkelement: fdisk or gdisk can be used to partition a disk.  there's also their curses versions cfdisk and cgdisk and the scriptable variations sfdisk and sgdisk.  the gdisk family of tools i specifically tailored to gpt although recent releases of fdisk also support gpt and proper alignment in the curses cfdisk.
<amstan>	leming: i'm not sure i can, it's not like i went to the store and brought all this hardware
<darkelement>	sheep: what do i need
<earnestly>	darkelement: if you wish to know how to use them, read their their manuals and/or play around with the commands
<darkelement>	i just want to know what i need to partition/make
<sheep>	darkelement: the beginner's guide and the installation guide have something in them to help you decide how you want to partition it
<leming>	amstan, i didn't go to the store and buy the majority of hardware i have either
<earnestly>	you can use 'h' in the interactive prompts used by fdisk and gdisk to see the commands you can use
<amstan>	leming: you have no strings attached to your hardware
<sheep>	if you're not using uefi booting, you just need one partition
<sheep>	at least one
<sheep>	uefi requires an efi system partition and at least one other partition for installing arch to
<earnestly>	darkelement: once you've tried and then don't understand, you can ask.  this helps us as it gives you more context so the advise makes sense
<earnestly>	leming: i wish we could just ignore the sillyness :(
<darkelement>	earnestly: sorry, i was confused
<leming>	earnestly, agreed
<earnestly>	leming: i wish there was a meaningful way to put stuff in the public domain, something you can't do in the us
<keenerd>	earnestly: considering that amstan doesn't want to maintain the package, at this point it is a net loss even if he released it right now.
<amstan>	keenerd: i do want to maintain it, i can't though
<earnestly>	all of the pkgbuilds and scriptlets could be released under isc or mit with patches being licensed under whatever the project requires
<amstan>	but yes.. i feel bad too, i worked for a few days on this, got it booting nicely, and can't share it with anyone, except the other guy in my team also a fan of arch
<amstan>	earnestly: that sounds good
<earnestly>	maybe not isc/mit actually, that'd b awkward
<earnestly>	maybe whatever cc's version of the public domain is, idk
<earnestly>	or maybe arch wants gpl for them
<amstan>	cc0, but cc doesn't recomend using it for code
<earnestly>	either way, this'll have to be discussed by the devs/tus because i don't know
<keenerd>	earnestly: interestingly it would have to be a retroactive assignment because it is based on arch's 3.8 kernel pkgbuild.
<earnestly>	keenerd: i wish all of this bs would simply go away
<darkelement>	gonna go ahead and do mkfs.btrfs /dev/sda
<earnestly>	but i guess all the pkgbuilds are a large body of work, so idk
<keenerd>	earnestly: get rid of all the lawyers.
<keenerd>	(or at least the ones at google.)
<earnestly>	keenerd: i added a license for my pkgbuilds: https://github.com/earnestly/pkgbuilds/blob/master/license
<phrik>	title: pkgbuilds/license at master · earnestly/pkgbuilds · github (at github.com)
<earnestly>	it's basically mit without the attribution clause
<earnestly>	by removing the attribution it means that you don't have to litter the downstream with license files
<vodik>	cloudef: i think i'll hack on buildhck :d
<vodik>	cloudef: you should pick a license
<keenerd>	what if leming translated his pkgbuild to sheet music (which is freely copiable in the us or something) and amstan published his modifications as sheet music and then someone untranslated it and put in the aur.
<earnestly>	:d
<amstan>	lol
<darkelement>	i believe i have mounted my partition, now to format, correct
<earnestly>	keenerd: it sounds just as stupid as the pgp source code book :p
<keenerd>	amstan: i assure you your lawyers are less scary than the whole us gov't coming down on gpg.
<sheep>	darkelement: you format before you mount it
<darkelement>	:|
<darkelement>	shit
<darkelement>	no
<darkelement>	wait
<sheep>	trying to mount an unformatted partition should fail
<darkelement>	i did that, sorry
<earnestly>	darkelement: simple: 1) format disks 2) give them a filesystem 3) mount them 4) ???? 5) profit!
<darkelement>	yea i diyea
<earnestly>	and that works on any distro
<earnestly>	where "????" is distro specific shenanigans
<darkelement>	so what file system should i use then
<earnestly>	vodik: he just went to sleep
<earnestly>	vodik: make an issue, or i can
<mrelendig>	btrfs is nice
<mrelendig>	ext4 or xfs is also fine
<earnestly>	darkelement: do you want snapshots?
<darkelement>	earnestly: do i?
<mrelendig>	btrfs can be really nice for a firsttimer due to snapshots
<earnestly>	darkelement: i can't say
<mrelendig>	so you can roll back when you fuck up
<darkelement>	lol
<braindamage>	i wonder tough, can't a new field for pkgbuild license be added? and perhaps made mandatory for new uploads?
<darkelement>	sure why not
<braindamage>	this way the aur would gradually get licensed
<earnestly>	mrelendig: to be sure that's fine, but actually setting up snapshots and rollback is a bit of a learning curve too
<sheep>	in terms of popularity, ext4 > btrfs > xfs, jfs, and ext3 > ext2
<earnestly>	braindamage: for the aur i'd honestly just say all of this is licensed under some license and be done with it
<earnestly>	if you don't agree, don't upload
<sheep>	earnestly: wtfpl?
<earnestly>	sheep: pretty much
<braindamage>	i'm not sure if you can retroactively do it tough
<sudokode>	if you upload a pkgbuild to the aur, you're pretty much saying "here, have this"
<braindamage>	legally speaking
<darkelement>	it appears i already added the btrfs filesystem to the partition
<earnestly>	braindamage: probably not
<sudokode>	even though that's not legally true
<sudokode>	the aur just needs something added to its terms
<sudokode>	well, first it would need terms
<darkelement>	how to mount
<earnestly>	sheep: except no
<earnestly>	sheep: because attribution is a pain to deal with, which is what this needs to avoid imo
<earnestly>	sheep: i like my hacked up mit license for this :p  -- effectively it is "do what the fuck you want", without all the other crap
<braindamage>	does it contain curse words in caps?
<sudokode>	earnestly: you mean like wtfpl?
<darkelement>	earnestly: hacked up mit license?
<earnestly>	sudokode: wtfpl has attribution and doesn't allow changing the license
<saivert>	please don't use those toy licenses that people wrote for fun
<earnestly>	sudokode: https://github.com/earnestly/pkgbuilds/blob/master/license
<sudokode>	earnestly: so non-copyleft?
<phrik>	title: pkgbuilds/license at master · earnestly/pkgbuilds · github (at github.com)
<saivert>	like the "do what the fuck you want license v1.0"
<earnestly>	sudokode: yeah
<saivert>	licenses containing swear words wont stand up in court
<sheep>	"permission is granted to use, copy, modify, and redistribute this file in modified or unmodified form.  this attribution may be removed if the file is modified"
<earnestly>	sudokode: it's my version of "public domain"
<earnestly>	basically; "do whatever you want, but if you break stuff, it's not my problem" :p
<sheep>	or just have a rule that says you assign attribution to whatever corporate entity arch is
<earnestly>	eh, cla is eeeeh
<demize>	sheep: it isn't one.
<earnestly>	or rather, la
<nfnty>	earnestly: why not just use cc0 instead?
<sudokode>	earnestly: why not 2-clause bsd?
<thenumb>	why not wtfpl?
<sudokode>	or fuck it, remove the second clause :d
<earnestly>	sudokode: because bsd2 is almost exactly mit
<earnestly>	and i remove that cause, yeah
<earnestly>	clause*
<earnestly>	nfnty: *shrug*
<sudokode>	you don't retain the first one though
<sudokode>	which makes the license more uh... sticky
<earnestly>	nfnty: that's probably fine too
<earnestly>	nfnty: in fact, it basically is the same
<sudokode>	earnestly: your license would actually get fucked in the us
<sudokode>	dunno about the uk
<earnestly>	sudokode: why?
<abrarsyed>	ive heard that one can embed the installation medium into a hard disk, and use it as a sort of recovery partition.. anyone done that? or know how to do that?
<mrelendig>	abrarsyed: not that usefull
<sudokode>	well, if you don't specify that you're entering it into the public domain, you retain copyright
<sudokode>	even with that warning there
<earnestly>	sudokode: you can't enter the public domain in us?
<sudokode>	you can, but you have to explicitly say such
<earnestly>	sudokode: lol
<amstan>	it should ideally be an osi aproved license: http://opensource.org/licenses
<phrik>	title: open source licenses | open source initiative (at opensource.org)
<earnestly>	sudokode: talk about overreaching
<sudokode>	earnestly: welcome to copyright
<sudokode>	"this software is hereby entered into the public domain."
<sudokode>	then the rest
<abrarsyed>	its proven useful to me when ive done stuff thats renderred my install unbootable.. just so hapenned that i had the disk and a cd drive handy at the time.. my current upgrade involves removing my cd drive,, and thus i would like insurance so that i dont need the cd any more to recovery, but instead just a peice of the harddisk
<earnestly>	amstan: http://opensource.org/faq#cc-zero
<phrik>	title: frequently answered questions | open source initiative (at opensource.org)
<sudokode>	or "this script" or "this document"
<sudokode>	it all falls under literary copyright in the us
<earnestly>	sudokode: i just need to do the least possible so i can return to not caring
<sudokode>	earnestly: what you've done is actually created an extremely loose copyleftish license
<sudokode>	and then warned potential assholes that you don't care
<demize>	sudokode: the issue is that that won't legally apply everywhere.
<sudokode>	but you don't even need a license to enter it into the public domain. the public domain strips away your copyright
<earnestly>	sudokode: sounds good
<sudokode>	demize: correct
<earnestly>	sudokode: catch 22?
<sudokode>	earnestly: s/.*/law/
<demize>	also, you do need a license to enter it into the public domain, because without a license (which is a form of contract) it will just be copyrighted.
<earnestly>	sudokode: heh.  just have a license with "public domain".  then for all the random entiries around the world that don't accept it, have a statement "fuck you <so and so>, yes it is."
<sudokode>	heh
<earnestly>	entities*
<d_garbage>	abrarsyed, i think grub can do that (boot from iso image) also the install image works on a usb, you could also install a fallback kernel
<earnestly>	sudokode: imagine that being read to a judge when it says someone can't put it in the pd
<demize>	"t is controversial, however, whether it is possible for a copyright holder to truly abandon the copyright of their work. robert a. baron argues in his essay "making the public domain public" that "because the public domain is not a legally sanctioned entity," a statement disclaiming a copyright or "granting" a work into the public domain has no legal effect whatsoever, and that the owner still retains all
<demize>	rights to the work not otherwise released."
<demize>	err
<demize>	it*
<earnestly>	demize: see, all the copyright doesn't even matter
<sudokode>	earnestly: you'd be aamazed at some of the documents that have been read in all seriousness in court
<earnestly>	sudokode: oh, i've heard of a few stories
<sudokode>	actually, some of the funniest are probably xyz vs fcc
<earnestly>	nfnty: hm, cc0 won't waive patents... wat?
<sudokode>	"your honors, i submit the following into evidence: a document entitled 20 ways to fuck a goat"
<sheep>	!grab sudokode
<phrik>	sheep: tada!
<dacoit>	thats canonical literature
<sheep>	dacoit: that explains ubuntu
<sudokode>	i'd call it nonfiction
<dacoit>	heehee
<earnestly>	sudokode: either that "if you don't have a public domain, get a civilisation you twits"
<earnestly>	that or*
<earnestly>	sudokode: :(, copyright is sadness
<sudokode>	earnestly: as it turns out, it can be very difficult to spread knowledge for the public good
<earnestly>	you can't even give them up without fighting something
<earnestly>	that's what i mean by overreaching
<earnestly>	people call gpl a virus, oh boy
<nfnty>	earnestly: seems so, yes. https://wiki.creativecommons.org/cc0_faq#what_about_other_ip_related_rights.2c_such_as_trademark_and_patent_rights.3f
<phrik>	title: cc0 faq - cc wiki (at wiki.creativecommons.org)
<sheep>	gpl only works because of copyright law
<sudokode>	yeah, you can't have a license without copyright
<mrelendig>	all licenses only works because of copyrihgt laws
<earnestly>	sheep: it doesn't need "auto-copyright" to function though
<sheep>	gpl isn't a virus; it's just the genetic payload of a virus
<sudokode>	earnestly: that's actually a good protection of copyright
<dacoit>	lol. we're the virus
<earnestly>	sudokode: what is?
<sudokode>	auto-copyright
<sudokode>	shakespeare would approve
<mrelendig>	nha
<mrelendig>	because he stole half his works of others
<earnestly>	shakespeare is dead
<demize>	auto-copyright would be okay if you could actually release it.
<earnestly>	that's my stance, yeah
<sudokode>	demize: what do you mean?
<earnestly>	like disabling autospawn in pulseaudio :o
<demize>	if you ceuld release the copyright on something.
<demize>	could*
<dacoit>	if only :p
<demize>	currently there's not really any way that really fully works.
<earnestly>	sudokode: it stinks that copyright is so invasive that you can't even say "pls no copyright for this, k thx"
<sudokode>	earnestly: you can
<earnestly>	sudokode: not everywhere
<sudokode>	everywhere sucks
<earnestly>	:d
<demize>	sudokode: say some place which has laws that say that you can.
<abrarsyed>	dgtlchlk, would it be easier to maybe download the tar.gz image of the install disk, and then mark it a bootable partiition or something? will grub pickup that via osprober?
<sudokode>	earnestly: https://github.com/earnestly/pkgbuilds/blob/ea0ea238455998324a9c2fc8df39b191e251282a/license
<phrik>	title: pkgbuilds/license at ea0ea238455998324a9c2fc8df39b191e251282a · earnestly/pkgbuilds · github (at github.com)
<sudokode>	otherwise i could just do that :
<sudokode>	:p
<demize>	and before you say the us, do find the (non-existent) law that say that.
<earnestly>	sudokode: that's fine
<sudokode>	as long as you prove you produced this document before me, my copyright is moot
<d_garbage>	earnestly, i see you've done another 'massive dump' on the internet :p
<sudokode>	and then actually an copy i have is infringing
<sudokode>	any*
<earnestly>	d_garbage: i should stop doing that so much
<d_garbage>	:)
<sudokode>	copying used to be a much more costly endeavor, so infringing works could really hurt an author
<earnestly>	sudokode: so, what would be a pd license, what would it look like?
<sudokode>	earnestly: there is no such thing
<d_garbage>	earnestly, why is it bad, out of interest?
<earnestly>	sudokode: i don't mind copyright
<sudokode>	you can't license something in the public domain
<sudokode>	because you no longer own the copyright
<sudokode>	it's free for anyone to use, but once it's modified, they now have copyright over the new copy
<earnestly>	d_garbage: because it doesn't explain changes.  bulk updates of versions is fine though
<demize>	a license would be needed to release the rights from the copyright.
<sudokode>	demize: "this document is hereby entered into the public domain upon <date> by <author>."
<sudokode>	that's a rather simplistic way to do it
<earnestly>	sudokode: djb does: http://cr.yp.to/publicdomain.html
<d_garbage>	ah
<demize>	sudokode: the public domain is not a legal entity.
<d_garbage>	well i mean the diff is there
<sudokode>	demize: sure it is
<earnestly>	sudokode: not everywhere
<demize>	it is not.
<demize>	in the us it definitely is not a legal entity.
<earnestly>	it doesn't exist in everywhere
<sudokode>	well, it's protected by law
<darkelement>	so guys how do i get a ...desktop with archlinux? i have installed all i need i believe.
<demize>	it's still not a legal entity you can give something to.
<sudokode>	demize: but the us government has control over the public domain
<demize>	you could most likely get away with it, but the law does not say that it works.
<teraflop>	i license the photos of my cat under the public domain for the good of humanity
<sudokode>	demize: pretty sure you can seek legal action if you think someone violated the public domain
<demize>	huh?
<sudokode>	as in, took an exact copy of something from the public domain and tried to copyright it
<sudokode>	essentially, someone would have to be stupid enough to try to inhibit the free use of something in the pd
<earnestly>	sudokode: this djb article is intresting
<demize>	that is not a violation.
<earnestly>	sudokode: it debunks a few things by contradicition
<earnestly>	using real examples
<sheep>	the classic way to debunk things
<earnestly>	that actually happened
<earnestly>	"if you see a ninth circuit panel writing "it is well settled that rights gained under the copyright act may be abandoned," and then a lawyer making the opposite claim, you probably expect the lawyer to explain the contradiction. rosen doesn't do this. in fact, he doesn't seem to be aware that he's contradicting anybody, let alone three federal judges and the ninth circuit model civil jury instructions."
<darkelement>	guys how can i get a desktop environment or window manager for arch
<dacoit>	read the wiki
<earnestly>	darkelement: you install the desired one(s)
<hwkiller>	darkelement: install whichever one you want?
<hwkiller>	pacman -syu gnome for example
<sudokode>	earnestly: the best reason to avoid the pd is this entire article
<teraflop>	darkelement: there's a wiki
<darkelement>	alrighty
<sudokode>	it's easier to point to a license than point to nothing
<earnestly>	sudokode: your analogies are shallow
<sudokode>	what analogy?
<sudokode>	that was all literal
<earnestly>	"t's easier to point to a license than point to nothing"
<earnestly>	this statement is meaningless
<earnestly>	and misleading
<sudokode>	i'm saying it's easier to curb abuse of copyright law by having a license rather than abandoning your copyright
<earnestly>	i don't care about the abuse of copyright for it though
<earnestly>	that's the whole point
<sudokode>	you do care about infringement though, i'm sure
<earnestly>	nope
<sudokode>	well nvm then
<earnestly>	not for a bunch of pkgbuilds
<sudokode>	no one really does care... except the one guy that has to care..
<sudokode>	where did he get to anyway?
<earnestly>	i'd honestly rather people take, copy and use as templates because they're a lot better than the shit in the aur and some of the repos
<earnestly>	sudokode: my dotfiles would probably be gpl2
<demize>	i'd say that "the author shall have the right to prohibit any distortion or any other mutilation of his work which would jeopardize his legitimate intellectual or personal interests in the work." sounds rather much like something that would sort of fall under copyright in the us
<sudokode>	earnestly: what about cc for pkgbuilds?
<earnestly>	sudokode: oh here's a thought.  what happens if you modify the source, offer patches back, but the patches are refused, in gpl
<demize>	(^ is part of urheberrechte, and cannot be waived.)
<demize>	earnestly: offering the patches doesn't inherently imply that your patch is licensed under the gpl.
<earnestly>	demize: "many germans incorrectly believe that copyrights cannot be abandoned. the actual situation in german law is that "nutzungsrechte" (literally "usage rights") include the rights of copying, modification, distribution, etc.; these rights can be waived, as in other countries. "urheberrechte" (literally "originator rights") include reputation rights and generally cannot be waived, but this protection
<earnestly>	against fraud, libel, etc. has nothing to do with whether something is in the public domain. beware that many sources (including google translate) mistranslate "urheberrecht" as "copyright"; this contributes to the common confusion among germans on this topic."
<sudokode>	earnestly: are you redistributing the patched work?
<demize>	earnestly: i know, i read, i wos countering that claim.
<demize>	earnestly: "the author shall have the right to prohibit any distortion or any other mutilation of his work which would jeopardize his legitimate intellectual or personal interests in the work."
<earnestly>	sudokode: imagine you take the kernel for some device, you add patches to it and offer them to the kernel.  upstream rejects the patches but you still want to distribute
<demize>	that quote seems very much relevant.
<demize>	and you cannot waive that right.
<sudokode>	earnestly: as long as the patches are gplv2, i don't see an issue
<sudokode>	i'm not familiar with software licenses though, even the gpl
<sudokode>	at least not intimately
<earnestly>	sudokode: you'd just have to make the patches available i guess
<earnestly>	along with the rest of the source
<demize>	(1) the author shall have the exclusive right to exploit his work in material form; his right shall comprise in particular:
<demize>	1. the right of reproduction (article 16);
<demize>	2. the right of distribution (article 17);
<demize>	3. the right of exhibition (article 18).
<sudokode>	what's that?
<earnestly>	eu stuff
<sudokode>	ah
<demize>	from urheberrecht.
<sudokode>	well, at least you have the right to reproduce in europe
<earnestly>	which means "originator rights"
<demize>	which also seems very relevant to the public domanin, and is another thing you cannot waive
<sudokode>	in china, reproduction rights are limited :p
<demize>	what the law means is irrelevant.
<earnestly>	basically, you can't take away the right of others to use your name (author) when referencing it
<mrelendig>	if you publish a book then you lose all of those
<demize>	sudokode: funneh.
<mrelendig>	due to fucked up publisher contracts
<demize>	earnestly: what i've quoted say way more than that.
<earnestly>	mrelendig: do contracts really trump it?
<mrelendig>	earnestly: sadly
<earnestly>	demize: yeah
<mrelendig>	earnestly: they force you to sign over all rights
<mrelendig>	most do anyway
<demize>	so you agree that what djb wrote isn't entirely correct.
<earnestly>	mrelendig: i don't see how that's possible.  it's almost as bad as saying eulas count
<earnestly>	demize: he is talking about the public domain though
<sudokode>	earnestly: eula would be a contract
<mrelendig>	so you end up with wanting to make another run because people have been asking you for your book
<mrelendig>	but the publisher says "nope"
<mrelendig>	or you want to make a third book in the serie
<earnestly>	:/
<demize>	earnestly: yes?...
<sudokode>	publishers have a shit ton of power everywhere
<mrelendig>	but then the publisher sues you because they own the copyright to your universe/story
<earnestly>	demize: that's unbelievably fucked up :d
<sudokode>	all major media industries usually do
<demize>	public domain doesn't inherently mean "related to the us copyright laws"
<sudokode>	they also have a fuck ton of lawyers
<mrelendig>	that have actually happened
<mrelendig>	several times
<sudokode>	earnestly: oh speaking of which, so that asshole decided to deny that woman with the service dog
<sudokode>	the guy that booked the rental for her pretty much said if it was any other place, he'd sue her
<sudokode>	and i wouldn't blame'em one bit
<earnestly>	sudokode: why can't he sue?
<sudokode>	he can
<earnestly>	sudokode: i mean, sort legally
<sudokode>	he's the son of another owner that recently died
<sudokode>	so he doesn't wanna screw the entire property over
<sudokode>	the property is a giant legal grey area involving a lot of non-compliance
<earnestly>	oh, so everyone is a little bit of an asshole then
<earnestly>	for now anyway, maybe he'll get it ethical eventually :p
<sudokode>	well, everyone's too afraid to ask anyone if we're grandfathered in or not under the ada or fha
<sudokode>	since they were enacted after the place was built
<earnestly>	sudokode: oh well.  i don't mind refusing service, but the specific instance was so dickish
<sudokode>	yeah and legally you really can't
<sudokode>	the owner is a complete tard though
<sudokode>	she's got it in her head that the dog doesn't count as a service dog
<amcrae>	this seems very offtopic!
<demize>	especially the us laws, god is all of those screwed up.
<demize>	amcrae: are you drunk?
<sudokode>	amcrae: don't ruin our fun d:
<earnestly>	amcrae: what license will you pick for all the pkgbuilds do you think?
<amcrae>	demize: 8:40am...
<demize>	amcrae: yes
<demize>	?*
<sudokode>	amcrae: so are you drunk?
<amcrae>	so not today :p
<sudokode>	booooring
<demize>	i'm confused, you're in here and not drunk?
<earnestly>	amcrae: https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/44893
<amcrae>	give me 7 hours...
<phrik>	title: fs#44893 : licensing for the archlinux repositories (at bugs.archlinux.org)
<amcrae>	i commented...
<mrelendig>	amcrae: get drunk and add a line to aur that says that all pkgbuilds uploaded are 1. agplv3  2. copyrighted ted the world creating donkey
<amcrae>	no - i think google is stupid :p
<amcrae>	and they should stop calling me at home!
<earnestly>	we all do
<amstan>	amcrae: lol, why are they calling you?
<amcrae>	recruitment
<amstan>	amcrae: ah
<nemesys>	how do you assign a default terminal emulator if you've downloaded say, xterm and terminology?
<sudokode>	amcrae: what do you mean not substantial enough for copyright?
<amcrae>	demize: give me op!  i want to boot chocobozzz_afk for having an away name
<sudokode>	if i draw something on my whiteboard, it's copyrighted
<sudokode>	at least in the us
<mrelendig>	nemesys: just click the correct icon in the menu
<braindamage>	if i draw something on my whiteboard, it's typically a dick
<mrelendig>	or change your keybinding
<nemesys>	mrelendig, what if you're trying to hotkey "open terminal"
<amcrae>	sudokode: because is it mostly copy paste from publicly available instructions
<earnestly>	sudokode: is there a license which basically doesn't have the "include this notice" that is basically mit?
<sudokode>	amcrae: you could enforce a license for arch packages and the aur though
<nemesys>	and it doesn't open a terminal
<yans>	y0! people
<mrelendig>	00:42:43  mrelendig ╡ or change your keybinding
<amcrae>	even gnu does not require copyright transfer for small patches
<nemesys>	mrelendig, it's not a keybinding issue
<sudokode>	amcrae: sure, but there's also creativity in a pkgbuild
<sudokode>	you have to insert logic in order for it to work
<nemesys>	literally the key binding is "open terminal"
<sudokode>	doing that makes it creative enough to be copyrighted
<earnestly>	amcrae: ncurses' pkgbuild is almost a real program :p
<sudokode>	:s
<amcrae>	sudokode: if you are being creative in a pkgbuild, you are probably doing it wrong
<mrelendig>	does it use xdg?
<sudokode>	lol
<amcrae>	earnestly: nope...  it was copied from lfs...
<nemesys>	xdg?
<nemesys>	brb, going to try a restart
<earnestly>	amcrae: heh
<nemesys>	see if that changes tings
<amcrae>	(so probably has a licence)
<sudokode>	amcrae: creative is one of those legal clusterfuck words, like "accidental" and "entry"
<mrelendig>	where are you seeing "open terminal"
<demize>	!grab sudokode
<phrik>	demize: tada!
<earnestly>	amstan: you could just maintain two separate but essentially identical pkgbuilds?
<amstan>	earnestly: what would that do?
<earnestly>	amstan: one to satisify your code review and one you can actually use outside of google
<demize>	earnestly: issue is that if it can be proved that he looked at the other copyrighted work when making the other..
<earnestly>	that'd be pretty tricky to prove
<earnestly>	dennis and thompson once wrote a complete program, in assembly, and their code was identical
<demize>	if he has two of them, it wouldn't really be.
<leming>	i'll cast my vote for the wtfpl too
<amstan>	earnestly: the patch i give to google should be licensed under gpl, and since i copied it from another licenseless pkgbuild it can't really be that
<earnestly>	that is, they both wrote the same program by mistake, isolated
<amcrae>	anyway...  i am fairly sure we rejected putting a copyright on pkgbuilds several times already
<amstan>	earnestly: and the patch i do externally has to be written without knowlege of my job
<demize>	leming: it is legally extremely ambiguous so wouldn't really hold up
<earnestly>	amstan: what a mess
<earnestly>	oh well.  can't say i care all that much about it.
<keenerd>	amstan: wait, you totally can license your patch file whatever you want.
<leming>	bradley kuhn (executive director of the free software foundation) was quoted saying that the fsf’s folks agree the wtfpl is a valid free software license.
<earnestly>	unless google takes it
<amstan>	keenerd: i could, but that would have to be a separate project then, i can't patch yours
<amstan>	keenerd: it would be blessed by google then
<amstan>	keenerd: but at that point i forked archlinuxarm
<keenerd>	amstan: no, not at all.  all it means is that the new pkgbuild would have to retain the licensing.
<amstan>	kjk: you mean not write code?
<kjk>	not pay attention to laws that are absolute bullshit.
<amstan>	kjk: that would get me fired
<amcrae>	who needs a job!
<kjk>	oh well, enjoy the game.
<amcrae>	speaking of which...   i should go to work...
<demize>	leming: that is irrelevant to what would legally be upholdable though.
<amstan>	kjk: and then there won't be any relevant patches from me anymore :(
<kjk>	hah!  so much for anarchy.
<earnestly>	amstan: that's what google wants ultimately
<amstan>	i doubt it
<earnestly>	wrangle wrangle wrangle
<amcrae>	so what package was being altered?
<amstan>	amcrae: copied https://github.com/archlinuxarm/pkgbuilds/tree/master/core/linux-chromebook2, made a new one
<kjk>	(anybody got any food?)
<dacoit>	:(
<amstan>	amcrae: it'll be the kernel for all the new rockchip chromebooks coming out
<amcrae>	amstan: what was chanfed (in general)?
<amstan>	amcrae: chanfed?
<kjk>	yans++
<amcrae>	changed
<yans>	sry but without ice
<yans>	i simply dont have it
<dacoit>	is that cheap knockoff of johnny walker black
<amstan>	amcrae: pretty much the whole config, various bits that are not relevant anymore from 3.8, the its file, the call to vbutil_kernel
<amcrae>	hrm...
<amcrae>	not sure what can be done there
<amstan>	it wasn't too ready, but it was bootable
<demize>	http://opensource.org/licenses/fair would be a more legally sound alternative to the wtfpl
<phrik>	title: fair license (fair) | open source initiative (at opensource.org)
<amcrae>	we would have to track down a lot of people to put any licence on our pkgbuilds now
<earnestly>	amcrae: i guess maybe just the new ones would count for now?
<amstan>	amcrae: a friend of mine suggested making a parallel repo, but that would be quite annoying
<kjk>	or all new maintainers, rewriting all of the package builds, with a universally agreed upon lisence ...
<amcrae>	anyway, i'm off
<fireburna>	hello can anyone tell me why the default grub arch logo background disapperead with recent update?
<parkerr>	fireburna: has it ever been there?
<parkerr>	i've always just had a black background
<dacoit>	same here. (grub2)
<fireburna>	well i had it for the last 2 years
<parkerr>	pacman -s grub, grub-install, grub-mkconfig, reboot
<fireburna>	no its just black background
<earnestly>	sudokode: hm.  who owns copyright of the license?
<parkerr>	i dont think ive ever seen a background in my 4 years of arch
<dacoit>	who watches the watchmen?
<sudokode>	the author
<kjk>	earnestly: doesn't somebody have to license the license if the license is copyrighted?
<mrelendig>	dacoit: the aliens
<mrelendig>	dacoit: also
<mrelendig>	!give dacoit fornicate
<phrik>	dacoit: http://arch.har-ikkje.net/gfx/fornicate.jpg
<earnestly>	sudokode: yes, but doesn't he also need a license to license it out?
<earnestly>	sudokode: how can other people use the license
<amstan>	kjk: i think gpl is copyrighted by rms
<dacoit>	hahaha why is that a factoif
<dacoit>	factoid
<amstan>	kjk: and not under an open source license

<sudokode>	everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<phrik>	title: front page — free software foundation — working together for free software (at fsf.org)
<demize>	actually, the wtfpl isn't actually a software license at all
<amstan>	sudokode: yep
<demize>	it's a license license
<sudokode>	earnestly: a simple statement like that
<earnestly>	sudokode: so why can't i do that?
<sudokode>	you can
<demize>	it just says that you can do anything you want with the license itself.
<teraflop>	crazy factoid
<earnestly>	sudokode: hm, okay
<fireburna>	but does anyone of you still have the background wallpaper of grub and can send it to me?
<kjk>	sudokode: it's hard to get away from axioms in a formal system.
<earnestly>	sudokode: so i can literally just remove the clause from the mit?
<fireburna>	somehow it is not on my systema nymore, very strange, must have happend just within the last days updates
<teraflop>	!give fireburna wat2
<phrik>	fireburna: http://i.imgur.com/0vdzt.gif
<sudokode>	earnestly: using an established license written by people that specialize in related legal matters is usually a safer route than creating your own license text
<demize>	earnestly: remove which clause?
<earnestly>	demize: including the notice
<earnestly>	the only clause mit has
<fireburna>	wat2 lol
<teraflop>	xd
<dacoit>	!give teraflop wat3
<phrik>	teraflop: tungsten, a heavy gray-white metallic element. astatine, heaviest of the halogen series.
<earnestly>	demize: even fair has the same clause
<teraflop>	dacoit: that factoid is beyond my understanding :p
<earnestly>	demize: "the above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.
<earnestly>	without this
<earnestly>	demize: because carrying around duplicates of the license file is annoying
<crazedpsyc>	fireburna: wat --> "background wallpaper of grub" <-- wat
<kjk>	which heinlein book was it that had 1967 denoted as "the year they hanged the lawyers"?
<crazedpsyc>	that's not a thing what are you talking about
<demize>	earnestly: sure
<fireburna>	so i gues no onbe has the grub background? anyone an idea which package it could have been to?
<crazedpsyc>	grub doesn't have a background

<sudokode>	earnestly: that's essentially a basic copyleft license
<earnestly>	tbh, no one cares anyway
<sudokode>	!shrug2
<fireburna>	sure you can add a background to the grub boot menu
<phrik>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<earnestly>	except big corporations
<crazedpsyc>	sure, you *can*
<kjk>	fireburna: you probably want an arch wallpaper and set up grub to display it
<crazedpsyc>	but there isn't one by default
<teraflop>	fireburna: yes you can!
<sudokode>	the big corporations with all the lawyers that like taking small time coders to court?
<crazedpsyc>	so asking for "the grub wallpaper" is meaningless
<sudokode>	yes, they do care
<d_garbage>	crazedpsyc, to you, it clearly means something to them
<d_garbage>	a tad more patience wouldn't go amiss
<fireburna>	okay is there an arch wallpaper package? maybe the one i am looking for s in there?
<earnestly>	fireburna: search for 'artwork'

<earnestly>	yans: gross, they watermark everything
<crazedpsyc>	that's also on the same wiki page
<crazedpsyc>	or you could log out and log in again
<sudokode>	earnestly: lol they actually put it in nearly the perfect place though
<earnestly>	sudokode: for windows many
<earnestly>	maybe*
<darkelement>	crazedpsyc: i'm root right now, how to log out and in as user
<sudokode>	huh?
<earnestly>	sudokode: taskbar can hide it
<yans>	darkelement: exit
<sudokode>	huh?
<teraflop>	heh
<sudokode>	i think i missed something
<darkelement>	yans: alright, it auto logs in as root
<sudokode>	oh
<sudokode>	you mean as a background
<sudokode>	i mean just for the image... it's nearly hidden

<crazedpsyc>	are you still using the installation image?
<darkelement>	arch linux
<kjk>	ahh...
<dacoit>	thank god
<darkelement>	crazedpsyc: i dunno
<crazedpsyc>	then you are
<darkelement>	ok
<crazedpsyc>	and you should actually install it and boot from it
<darkelement>	:|
<darkelement>	thought i did already
<darkelement>	guess not
<crazedpsyc>	if it's virtualbox, make sure you remove the iso in settings
<darkelement>	alright
<darkelement>	what should i replace the iso with
<darkelement>	...
<dacoit>	nothing preferably, your aim is to boot arch
<dacoit>	which is installed to the disk at the end of the install process
<darkelement>	it must not have done that
<darkelement>	that or idk what physical drive to use
<d_garbage>	fireburna, dunno if it's in a package but you can also get that image from the archiso source https://projects.archlinux.org/archiso.git/plain/configs/releng/syslinux/splash.png

<dacoit>	what
<supergeek800>	how common is the problem in 3.14.40lts involving the r8712 driver being broken in that kernel? posted about it both in the forums and on the fb page to try and get more info on it.
<stumbles>	is 'ignore' the correct boolean false for that file ?
<supergeek800>	reason: my solution of staying on 3.19.3 is meant primarily as a band-aid.
<dacoit>	stumbles: man logind.conf
<stumbles>	oy vey man files are my favorite

<supergeek800>	someone on the fb page suggested i use ndiswrapper to install the windows rtl8191su driver, but i'm just wondering of there are other solutions out there.
<dacoit>	earnestly: i like this philology of vampires better than the last
<earnestly>	it is pretty good, as are most of his blog posts fwiw
<supergeek800>	this being my forum post relating to the problem, the possible troubleshooting info being in the screencaps linked: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=197119
<phrik>	title: realtek rtl8191su broken in kernel 3.14.40 lts / networking, server, and protection / arch linux forums (at bbs.archlinux.org)
<earnestly>	supergeek800: i'd be fairly apprensive about any suggestions to use ndiswrapper
<earnestly>	supergeek800: you must have picked some of the unluckiest set of hardware to be suffering these issues :(
<mvdw>	i'm having some really annoying problems regarding my laptops "beep". i just can't seem to mute it. i tried muting it and putting it to 0% with alsamixer but it doesn't help.
<dacoit>	mvdw: rmmod pcspkr
<supergeek800>	basically, wireless nic broken in 3.14.40, hopefully fixed in 3.14.41, and gpu is unsupported by 4.x.x atm.
<mpdavis73>	i need some n00b coding advice - other than turbopascal in 1991, and a touch of c++ in 1992, the closest i have done to coding was a couple of powershell scripts and bash one-liners (sysadmin stuff), thinking about python, looking for suggestions to get started again

<earnestly>	wonderful
<kjk>	stumbles: man logind.conf gives me a section on handle[various things, one of which is lidswitch] and tells me that using 'ignore' will prevent systemd from trying to handle it.
<earnestly>	kjk: well, logind specifically
<csc`>	i know right
<kjk>	earnestly: my bad.  :x
<supergeek800>	csc`: and as for the 4.* kernel series, i assume there's no chance in hell on this hardware.
<csc`>	tis why i havent bothered getting a 'regular' distro running on it
<supergeek800>	csc`: at least for now.
<supergeek800>	(r300 support may or may not go into 4.* at some point, dunno)
<kjk>	stumbles: i figured out to use the man page because there is a top comment in the logind.conf you pasted that says "see logind.conf(5) for details"
<kjk>
<supergeek800>	dacoit: so i'm guessing running localmodconfig in 3.14.40 could fix some shit or?
<supergeek800>	*for the wireless problem
<dacoit>	supergeek800: nope
<kjk>	stumbles: i got a hint from the paste that i might need to look for "handlelidswitch."  i used the '/' in the pager to search for it.  the slash is pretty standard, it's been around since 'ed' and before.
<supergeek800>	so i'm fucked and stuck on an unsupported kernel or going to have to ditch arch for ubuntu or windows.
<kjk>	stumbles: sorry about the sarcasm, i'm not trying to piss you off...
<dacoit>	its just a way to compile only needed modules to speed up compile. like i said, probably not much hope for you in terms of solving this with a custom compile (i cant say)
<supergeek800>	or see if there's maybe an unsupported repo that has lts32 in it (although i dunno how well systemd supports 3.2)
<sudokode>	kjk: never apologize ahead of time
<octocpp>	is there a way to see which config files throughout the system have been edited from their defalut?
<sudokode>	it makes you look weak before your enemy
<heftig>	octocpp: pacman -qkk

<dacoit>	octocpp: pacman -qkk
<dacoit>	oh
<supergeek800>	(should have something in the wiki about installing drivers externally)
<heftig>	octocpp: actually, pacman -qqkk is probably better

<mvdw>	ola.
<jones221>	im trying to add an unoffical key. 'pacman -r <key>', gives me the reposnse gpg: keyserver recive failed: no keyserver available'
<sheep>	jones221: you need to specify a keyserver on the command line or in /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/gpg.conf
<d_garbage>	pgp.mit.edu is one
<jones221>	sheep there is a keyserver in the conf file, which i have _not_ added manually.
<jushur>	hmm should worked without that, if has init his keys?
<sheep>	which keyserver is there?
<jones221>	pool.sks-keyservers.net
<jones221>	will try the mit one, thanks
<kjk>	sudokode: i wasn't apologizing ahead of time, i was paraphrasing.  heh.
<jones221>	d_garbage that one seemed to work, thanks

<sheep>	i don't know if silverlight was ever ported to the new ppapi
<sheep>	but that would have been on windows
<d_garbage>	why not use chromium?
<mvdw>	silverlight is dead and it should stay dead, people at my school keep attempting to revive it.

<sheep>	mvdw: why do they try to revive it?
<jon-->	d_garbage, ahh that is very possible
<mvdw>	they once grew familiar with it and can't let go.
<jon-->	sheep, d_garbage, looks like the issue is updated kernel, thanks.
<d_garbage>	jon--, that's what those checks everyone mentioned are for. if you updated the kernel and modules they no longer match the kernel running in memory
<jones221>	http://sprunge.us/cwje is the pacman dump
<kjk>	sheep: the clinic i used to work at has xp boxes used in outpatient surgery in instrument systems.
<sheep>	kjk: you made the mistake of working with doctos
<sheep>	*doctors
<kjk>	part of the legacy accounting system uses cobol
<mvdw>	lol
<dacoit>	lol
<sheep>	that's not so bad
<d_garbage>	jones221, did you forget to add the options? :)
<d_garbage>	jones221, otherwise there's no error :)
<mvdw>	people really need to let xp go.
<d_garbage>	aww xp
<kjk>	sheep: doctors are easy.  *lawyers* are easy.  try working with librarians in a coding library sometime.
<d_garbage>	win7 is ok though
<jones221>	d_garbade oh, i though that was like like a default dump of something pacman lol
<mvdw>	if you're going windows, do 7 yeah.
<mvdw>	ms isn't even supporting xp anymore.
<supergeek800>	may have come across a solution in the form of the r8192s_usb driver, since after a little looking around, that driver seems to support my nic, just need to obtain it and see if it'll work.
<d_garbage>	supergeek800, check the aur
<jones221>	d_garbage okay so i saved all the 3 commands with out to a file cant cat it. http://sprunge.us/jasd
<supergeek800>	how i found the possible solution, go down to 'rt8191su,' and you'll see two drivers listed that support that chip, the older r8712u driver and the newer r8192s_usb driver: https://wikidevi.com/wiki/wireless_adapters/chipset_table
<supergeek800>	d_garbage: although with all things being equal, this driver being in beta, so to speak, going into an lts kernel supposedly, wouldn't that cause some shit?
<sudokode>	lol so i called my parents up and asked if they got their new furniture yet
<dacoit>	i dont get it
<sudokode>	they were like... no, saturday. but the guy who sold it to us 4 weeks ago died
<sudokode>	like wtf
<dacoit>	o_o
<sudokode>	that's so terrible
<sudokode>	he had cancer apparently
<dacoit>	:(
<sudokode>	they were probably his last sale
<sudokode>	that's pretty crazy
<bobbertson>	does anyone use mpv?
<sudokode>	ofcv
<dacoit>	!anyone
<phrik>	nope, just you
<sudokode>	-v
<halosghost>	bobbertson: everyone that wants a decent cli media player
<bobbertson>	anyone know if there is a way to make mpv open up the video in a new window but exit the terminal part so that the terminal doesnt stay open, without a script and without doing "mpv &"
<bobbertson>	like a setting
<d_garbage>	supergeek800, heh dunno, i'd just googled it and got that far
<sudokode>	bobbertson: yeah, use smplayer and set it to use mpv
<dacoit>	:/
<sudokode>	for your original question... detach? yeah sure..
<dacoit>	mpv & disown; exit
<sudokode>	mpv foo.mkv &>/dev/null &
<sudokode>	or that
<sudokode>	probably cleaner
<bobbertson>	b-but i said without a script and without &
<bobbertson>	something more clean or built i n
<supergeek800>	d_garbage: might as well try it, might be my only shot at getting an up-to-date kernel, even if it's majorly behind the stable kernel versionwise, it'd beat being out in the open like i am with 3.19.3.
<bobbertson>	like an ability to disable to the terminal view shit at all
<d_garbage>	supergeek800, the posts i was getting were a few years old but were saying that r8192s_usb was dropped for  r8712u
<sudokode>	bobbertson: smplayer
<sudokode>	:d
<dacoit>	well its a cli player
<sudokode>	it doesn't daemonize in other words
<dacoit>	so frontend is your best hope
<bobbertson>	i dont need all that info in the terminal though
<bobbertson>	im using a tiling window manager so
<supergeek800>	d_garbage: and anything on r300 for the current stable kernel?
<sudokode>	it's only meant to run in the foreground
<sudokode>	bobbertson: same. i use smplayer :d
<bobbertson>	i gotta hide the window in a scratchpad or do & at the end and then press enter to exit out of the terminal view thing and close the terminal
<sudokode>	loved it back when i used mplayer and love it all over again
<dacoit>	the info you can hide, but not without using shell commands
<bobbertson>	lol why would i use smplayer
<mvdw>	night peoples.
<bushido_>	my i3 wm showing the border line color
<bobbertson>	im not some scrub
<d_garbage>	mvdw, good night
<bushido_>	it's does not showing any color lines on terminal
<sudokode>	who you callin scrub?
<sudokode>	thems fightin words
<dacoit>	!shrug2
<phrik>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<jushur>	bobbertson: you could use tmux and detatch it
<bobbertson>	is the border red busido
<sudokode>	jushur: actually yeah, that's what i did before smplayer supported mpv
<d_garbage>	supergeek800, dunno i'd just be googling the same as you :)
<bobbertson>	i will just stick to doing mpv videofilename.mkv & then pressing enter and closing it if theres no built in option
<dacoit>	&>/dev/null & disown; exit
<sudokode>	here are 8 alternatives
<coolthingy500>	what de/wm are you use?
<sudokode>	fuck it, i'll just carry on hating my life

<bobbertson>	oh wait smplayer does mpv now?
<d_garbage>	it's kind of a hoby of mine, googling people's questions, come up with interesting stuff sometimes
<supergeek800>	d_garbage: of course if i'm stuck with the lts kernel if i want an up-to-date kernel, that's fine.
<bobbertson>	shiet
<sudokode>	bobbertson: yes lol

<jushur>	bobbertson: me pesronaly always lauch my vidoes from console anyway, and i preffer to have the console still open showing feedback when playing.
<sudokode>	my excited laughter was too much for words
<sudokode>	lol cannot do it justice
<bobbertson>	the feedback isnt even anything useful that the osd doesnt show

<sudokode>	getting old sounds great
<bushido_>	d_garbage: http://ix.io/inr
<sudokode>	just fuckin great
<sudokode>	and old people say their older years are the best
<dacoit>	you've already got it
<sudokode>	probably cause they're all hopped up on legal drugs
<d_garbage>	bushido_, :)
<bobbertson>	lol who the fuck says that?
<sudokode>	bobbertson: 50 and 60 year olds
<dacoit>	pensioners
<d_garbage>	bushido_, i don't know anything about that wm personally though
<bobbertson>	most old people say their young years were the best and to take advantage of them etc
<kjk>	bobbertson: people who can see the tunnel at the end of the light say that.
<kjk>	it makes them feel better about it.
<dacoit>	tunnel at the end of the light ???
<kjk>	somehow.
<fy_icewurld>	if you get to 50-60 and haven't done any drugs you wasted you life
<bobbertson>	i hate to think about getting old
<bobbertson>	know the end of your world is inevitable
<kjk>	it is, indeed, a drag.
<jones221>	since there is alot of new activity i'll try to pop it again. i am not able to sign a unoffical key. here is the output http://sprunge.us/jasd
<sudokode>	fy_icewurld: i said legal drugs
<d_garbage>	bobbertson, that's true in many ways maybe but there's a lot of rose-tinted spectacles being worn too. life can be hard at any age.
<fy_icewurld>	what are legal drugs?
<bushido_>	d_garbage: np
<dacoit>	marijuansa
<sudokode>	fy_icewurld: schedule 5
<jones221>	coffe!
<sudokode>	if you're in the us
<fy_icewurld>	i'm talking about lsd, doughnuts and cocaine
<sudokode>	those are schedule 1
<sudokode>	and very illegal
<shanemikel>	fy_icewurld: salvia!
<kjk>	donuts are legal for cops.
<sudokode>	kjk: fuckin pigs
<dacoit>	and snowy parking lots
<fy_icewurld>	insane combo, all in one night. well leave cocaine out for that night, try lsd + mdma + doughnuts
<bushido_>	anyone else look this urxvt config for i3 wm http://ix.io/inr
<kjk>	jones221: i'm not coming up with what might be causing that.
<bushido_>	i asked on #i3 but still no rely there..very low activity there
<bobbertson>	does anyone here use luakit
<dacoit>	no
<halosghost>	phrik: give bobbertson anyone

<jushur>	kjk: +1
<hongouru>	kjk, +1 too
<hongouru>	i deserved that
<jones221>	kjk no i don't get it. found alot about it on the forums, but nothing seems to work
<kjk>	jones221: i'm not getting it either.  i looks like maybe your local key isn't trusted.  (???)
<hongouru>	my time is like 3 days ago
<hongouru>	i turned the pc off all that time
<kjk>	no time machine needed, then, just a good 72 hour nap.

<hongouru>	d_garbage, hey whats up !!! ill check it out
<jones221>	kjk how so? can i check that?
<hongouru>	d_garbage, thanks
<hongouru>	d_garbage, nice joke

<bobbertson>	i used grep and got a description for what sounds like it
<bobbertson>	but idk how to get the previous line that actually has the package name
<halosghost>	bobbertson: read the man page more closely
<halosghost>	you can use regexp in search
<hongouru>	i dont have chronyd.service
<kjk>	or pacman -ss terminal\ emulator
<d_garbage>	jones221, did you say you'd done the thing from the news about resetting the keyring? (/etc/pacman.d/gnupg)
<shanemikel>	bobbertson: you can use -b1 to get 1 line before each match
<bobbertson>	thanks shanemikel thats what i was looking for
<kjk>	d_garbage: he said it twice.
<d_garbage>	oh :p
<jones221>	d_garbage yes. ive delted /etc/pacman.d/gnupg and /root/.gnupg
<bobbertson>	but no thats not the right terminal :9
<bobbertson>	:(
<halosghost>	ಠ_ಠ
<shanemikel>	bobbertson: i believe st is in aur and the package name is simply 'st'
<jones221>	d_garbage and of course ran pacman-key --init, pacman-key --populate archlinux

<bobbertson>	doesnt matter if you are right i think you are wrong

<jones221>	xterm
<jones221>	wops
<halosghost>	change line in config.h, rebuild

<bobbertson>	it just werkz
<sudokode>	i think i took it apart

<charlesatum>	send me it
<halfwit>	do not operate motor vehicles
<sleepycat>	i am playing with my first package, and it installs a daemon process. is it considered bad form to enable/start services in the post_install?
<halfwit>	if you're being hyperbolic, stop.
<sheep>	sleepycat: on arch, yes
<charlesatum>	depends, is your apps extremely essential?
<charlesatum>	like, making the system boot important
<jones221>	haven't used it for long, but using haskell takes some time getting into. for me at least
<sheep>	that's expected in debian, but arch packages never enable any services
<d_garbage>	sleepycat, yes, i would think so
<halfwit>	coolthingy500: they failed to evolve with the market. when they finally did, it was too little, too late.
<sleepycat>	sheep: ahh. yeah, i know debian get flak for that.
<sheep>	they don't even restart services
<bobbertson>	well haskell probably is made for a completely different kind of programming so
<sleepycat>	sheep: really?
<d_garbage>	i think systemd restarts itself?
<halfwit>	bobbertson: functional
<bobbertson>	looks like it would be neat for math or some shit
<bobbertson>	ya
<diegoviola>	would a system with a kernel with a broken acpi consume more energy (i.e. your energy bills going up) than one with proper acpi support?
<seylerius>	sleepycat: yeah. they stick a message in the post-install to remind you if it's necessary.
<sleepycat>	sheep: so not even enable it?
<sheep>	sleepycat: arch packages don't enable or restart services
<halfwit>	it's reasonably usable for everything you could imagine.
<coolthingy500>	halfwit,  oh didn't know that. when i used to be in grade 7, people would flant those blackberries phones and bully me because i didn't have a mobile phone only until after i finished school.
<d_garbage>	sleepycat, i doubt it. that's a user's business. you could put a post install message though
<sleepycat>	sheep: ok. an unambiguous answer. :)
<seylerius>	users are expected to actually read the output of an install.
<sleepycat>	seylerius: crazy!
<jones221>	well its just different, some people really love functional programing languages for everything
<d_garbage>	sleepycat, i'm not a dev or even a programmer but i personally would be very annoyed if a package did that
<halfwit>	coolthingy500: there does not exist a phone today that is worthy of being called exceptional, just get one that does the job-- and doesn't break the bank,
<halosghost>	jones221: it's better than procedural/objectionable in a ton of ways
<dacoit>	objectionable lolol
<sheep>	lol objectionable
<halosghost>	jones221: the immutable-by-default principle is getting to be adopted most places these days
<halosghost>	dacoit, sheep: the only valid name
<halosghost>	:p
<seylerius>	sleepycat: for example, if you're installing an package that extends emacs, it doesn't add anything to your ~/.emacs, or your ./.emacs.d/init.el, or anything else. it pops a message with a bit of elisp that you can add wherever you want.
<sheep>	object-obsessed "programming"
<coolthingy500>	halfwit, i boughted myself a samsung mini s3 with a 32gb sd mini card. works well with my arch box to transfer files thanks to the arch wiki.
<dacoit>	:p
<halosghost>	sheep: too charitable
<halfwit>	halosghost: i like that it eliminates a complete set of issues, just by virtue of that alone
<sleepycat>	d_garbage: ok. i'm used to debian, and new to arch... but i had a feeling that there was a different culture around that stuff.
<dacoit>	sheep is a bleeding heart
<halosghost>	halfwit: indeed
<charlesatum>	nice regular-irregular past
<halosghost>	halfwit: i'm trying to get into it enough that i can move most of my code over to haskell
<halosghost>	halfwit: it's so much simpler in so many ways
<jones221>	halosghost i can see the apeal, but i really do not like writing functional code. had a subject on it, hated every part
<halfwit>	halosghost: it's so nice.
<bobbertson>	idk how to transfer files to my blackberry on arch
<bobbertson>	without the network mode turned on
<halfwit>	halosghost: i had a one-liner for most of my project euler answers when i was trying it xd
<halosghost>	jones221: it's a new paradigm, it'll take time to get used to
<charlesatum>	can you write a emulator in haskell?
<halosghost>	halfwit: indeed :)
<halfwit>	and memoization
<dacoit>	yeah
<halosghost>	charlesatum: it's turing-complete
<sleepycat>	thanks everyone!
<charlesatum>	s/a/an/
<halosghost>	sleepycat: you're welcome
<sheep>	monads
<charlesatum>	so, insanely difficul, but yes?
<d_garbage>	sleepycat, don't forget there's a mailing list for packaging help too
<halosghost>	charlesatum: wut
<houn>	argh!  i3!  why are you so difficult at arranging windows!
<dacoit>	nope, and yes
<bobbertson>	why do you bother correcting someons grammur
<halfwit>	there was an engine completed already for something... um.
<halfwit>	doom maybe?
<jones221>	halosghost. yeah sure, but i'm so happy with python and c, i don't really see the need for it. for me personally that it
<jones221>	is
<charlesatum>	becausae gareman rlz
<halosghost>	jones221: c is horrible
<bobbertson>	you dont need it
<bobbertson>	its just there
<halosghost>	jones221: it's better than almost eerything else
<bobbertson>	if you want to use it
<halfwit>	bobbertson: to better each persons ability to converse, we often correct errors when we see them.
<halosghost>	jones221: but it's horrible :)
<halosghost>	jones221: that's why i'm moving to hsakell
<halfwit>	bobbertson: communication is incredibly important, you see.
<jones221>	halosghost c is heaven
<halosghost>	jones221: it really isn't
<halosghost>	most of everything i do is in c
<halosghost>	and it's terrible
<halosghost>	again, i use it because it sucks less than most other things
<halosghost>	but that doesn't make it good
<jones221>	haha
<jones221>	well i do love it
<halosghost>	how long have you been working with it?
<halosghost>	because, that'll pass
<seylerius>	i think c sucks less than c++, but...
<jones221>	lol
<jones221>	3-4 years
<sheep>	seylerius: that's like saying dog poo is better than horse poo
<jones221>	writing an os in c atm
<halfwit>	sheep: for certain applications, certainly.
<dacoit>	which it totally is
<halosghost>	there's some inherent beauty in c, but it's so incredibly unsafe
<bobbertson>	cool stuff jones221
<dacoit>	horses shit the mass of a small dog
<jones221>	unsafe how?
<halfwit>	"there's beauty and there's danger here-- split the ice apart!"
<halosghost>	jones221: all the ub
<halfwit>	jones221: it can be as safe or unsafe as you know how to make it.
<halosghost>	halfwit: what? no
<halosghost>	halfwit: tons of things in c will never be safe
<hiptobecubic>	right
<seylerius>	i beg to differ; horse shit is not only less odoriferous than dog shit, it's also a surprisingly good fuel.
<seylerius>	although, there is an awful lot of it.
<halosghost>	lol
<hiptobecubic>	that's the kind of thing that people who have never used a language with a good type system say.
<sheep>	what have i done? i caused #archlinux to have a serious argument comparing horse crap and dog crap
<coolthingy500>	well could be worse.
<bobbertson>	hmmm cower sounds nice
<halfwit>	that's not saying you can't do things that are safe in it brah.
<seylerius>	it's all your fault.
<hiptobecubic>	and most people *haven't* used a language with a good type system. it doesn't have to be haskell, but it's certainly not c.
<coolthingy500>	we don't need more standard agruments
<halosghost>	hiptobecubic: very few languages have as good a type system as haskell
<halfwit>	halosghost: haskell is sexy though.
<hiptobecubic>	halfwit, you can theoretically do things in that are safe, sure. but most people don't use jpl's coding standards so the argument is moot
<halosghost>	halfwit: indeed
<seylerius>	who's got an opinion on clojure?
<halfwit>	hiptobecubic: eh. most people suck!
<halosghost>	seylerius: jvm, hissssss!
<halosghost>	it burns muhskin
<dacoit>	anyone that used javascript
<halfwit>	hiptobecubic: i hope they don't code anything important, like banking stuf-- ohwaittheydo!
<halosghost>	lol
<halfwit>	fuckin' blame the tool that blames the tool.
<halfwit>	!next
<phrik>	another satisfied customer! next!
<hiptobecubic>	halfwit, and? is that supposed to make me believe it's well done? first of all, you're thinking of java, not c. secondly, i've worked in a bank in risk management and the code quality if fucking horrendous.
<halfwit>	hiptobecubic: yeah, i was alluding to that.
<seylerius>	halosghost: so, you ph34r the jvm. a powerful ph34r indeed.
<hiptobecubic>	the jvm is good at what it does
<halosghost>	seylerius: i don't fear it; it just burns me
<hiptobecubic>	which is to run programs written in java
<halosghost>	hiptobecubic: spreading plagues?
<halosghost>	ahh, so yes then
<halfwit>	yeah
<coolthingy500>	please don't remind me about java or javascript. it's a nightmare to learn!
<hiptobecubic>	javascript and java are extremely unrelated
<d_garbage>	this just blew my mind https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx9edos76lm
<dacoit>	js can be done by children
<bobbertson>	what
<dacoit>	and mostly is
<d_garbage>	[audrey hepburn: galaxy chocolate commercial]
<dacoit>	50% of all programmers
<d_garbage>	http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/oct/08/how-we-made-audrey-hepburn-galaxy-ad
<phrik>	title: how we resurrected audrey hepburntm for the galaxy chocolate ad | media network | the guardian (at www.theguardian.com)
<hiptobecubic>	javascript is only called javascript because naming things by association with "java" was a valuable trick in the 90's
<coolthingy500>	that explains the shitty work that google has done with youtube.
<jones221>	have you tried go?
<halosghost>	jones221: yes, i don't like it
<halosghost>	hiptobecubic: well, js was originally keyword-compatible with java
<jones221>	i haven't yet, but i heard alot of nice things about it
<d_garbage>	i was thinking 'holy crap! that actress *really* looks like audrey hepburn!"
<halosghost>	hiptobecubic: that changed very quickly :p
<halfwit>	it's gaining a lot of steam
<bobbertson>	i have little motivation to do any personal programming projects
<jones221>	emphasis on thread management
<d_garbage>	cgi is getting scary good these days
<halosghost>	jones221: meh
<halosghost>	were i to pick one of the cxx successors, i'd pick rust
<halosghost>	but rust still doesn't have remotely everything i wan
<halosghost>	s/$/t/
<witquicked>	i'm confused by the difference between /etc/systemd/system/ and /usr/lib/systemd/system as it pertains to timers
<halosghost>	so, to haskell with me
<bobbertson>	i want to make an ncurses program that has a list of shows i have watched, and plan to watch and lets you choose one and it automatically opens the next episode in your video player
<witquicked>	updatedb.timer gets a symlink in the /usr/lib/ directory, which seems to activate it
<dacoit>	witquicked: /etc/ is for administrative override of
<jones221>	haha, sure. maybe i'll fall in love white configuring xmonad
<witquicked>	oic
<dacoit>	/usr/lib
<jones221>	while
<stormysea>	bobbertson, that sounds like a cool project
<hiptobecubic>	jones221, you won't. configuring xmonad is pretty frustrating if you don't know what's going on :)
<witquicked>	so the stuff that's in the /usr/lib directory would be what is considered "system-level" units/timers
<hiptobecubic>	it gets better later, kind of, but it's pretty rough at first
<d_garbage>	bobbertson, you could see how livestreamer-curses did it, i think that's in python
<dacoit>	"default"
<halosghost>	jones221: haskell is incredibly nice
<witquicked>	that's the word
<hiptobecubic>	halosghost, have you tried any of the mls?
<bobbertson>	i dont have any time this weekend though ;_;
<halfwit>	witquicked: grease
<halosghost>	hiptobecubic: i haven't
<halosghost>	hiptobecubic: i've never heard anything bad about them though
<witquicked>	but for instance, since updatedb.timer is symlinked in /usr/lib/system/multi-user.target.wants, if i wanted to "override" it by shutting down, there's no way to do that just by "adding" a symlink into /etc/system/systemd
<jones221>	halosghost yeah, sure, but i often make a point of understanding what is going on. if i'm going to switch over to xmonad for good, i'm going to understand everything about my config too
<bobbertson>	i was thinking of doing it in python
<halosghost>	jones221: haskell makes that easy
<bobbertson>	either python or c
<halosghost>	those are dramatically different langs
<jones221>	even if i have to embrance one of these functional languages
<halosghost>	and ncurses is horrible
<bobbertson>	no it isnt
<halosghost>	yes, it is
<bobbertson>	what do you suggest instead brah
<halosghost>	using it is awesome
<coolthingy500>	as bad as javascript?
<halosghost>	coding it is a nightmare
<halosghost>	coolthingy500: far worse in many ways
<dacoit>	witquicked: systemctl mask or symlink to /dev/null in /etc/systemd
<d_garbage>	bobbertson, or there's youtube-viewer that's perl
<bobbertson>	it looks pretty ugly but it doesnt look horrible
<halosghost>	bobbertson: again, using it is awesome; coding with it is horrible
<witquicked>	dacoit, excellent, thanks for the pointer
<coolthingy500>	halosghost,  i'll stay with python for now.
<jones221>	i found ncurses in python was pretty easy
<halosghost>	coolthingy500: lol
<bobbertson>	well i already know python, c, c++, and c# so
<d_garbage>	eh, not sure if that one's curses actually
<edit>	:/
<halosghost>	bobbertson: “know c++”
<jones221>	as most things are
<halosghost>	bobbertson: sure
<edit>	cool
<edit>	thing
<bobbertson>	damn thats a pretty small program
<d_garbage>	anyway i think there are a lot of examples of that kind of thing out there to look at
<bobbertson>	the livestreamer-curses
<d_garbage>	handy for twitch, i use it all the time
<halosghost>	d_garbage: `mpv` / `youtube-dl` support twitch now
<d_garbage>	indeed
<d_garbage>	?
<d_garbage>	getting better all the time
<halosghost>	well
<bobbertson>	i used livestreamer
<halosghost>	ytdl sucks
<bobbertson>	but not this
<bobbertson>	what does this add
<halosghost>	but, it's the only optoin
<halosghost>	s/oin$/ion
<d_garbage>	bobbertson, the kind of ncurses menu you mentioned
<houn>	wait.  i don't have to use i3status at all, do i?  i can just throw some conky or whatever up there.
<bobbertson>	sorry man im so tired i cant think or read this shit right now
<halosghost>	houn: sure
<bobbertson>	so its just a menu and you can add streamers channels or something
<d_garbage>	bobbertson, basically yes
<bobbertson>	and it saves them
<bobbertson>	sounds nice
<d_garbage>	and then launches them
<d_garbage>	also has a view count
<bobbertson>	god i love super useful programs that are simple, short, and sweet
<d_garbage>	yup
<bobbertson>	gives me an erection
<halosghost>	ಠ_ಠ
<bobbertson>	i also wanted to make my own irc client
<halosghost>	weechat
<halosghost>	phrik: next
<phrik>	another satisfied customer! next!
<bobbertson>	but i mean fuck playing around with sockets and shit
<bobbertson>	dont have time for that shit
<d_garbage>	i have to do a tiny edit to it though to  change one of the key binds that's a bit annoying :)
<bobbertson>	im using weechat right now and love it
<bobbertson>	would be cool to have my own home baked thing though
<bobbertson>	to be able to slowly add only the features i want and use
<halosghost>	take a look at `ii` or `sic`
<d_garbage>	the bind for 'refresh all channels' is shift-o so i change it to just o cause who want to press an extra shift all the time?
<halosghost>	heh
<bobbertson>	weechat is sick though
<bobbertson>	i feel bad for all those suckers still using irssi
<bobbertson>	im going to keep using these hip words and you cant stop me
<halfwit>	may it get well soon
<bobbertson>	unless you kick me out of the chat or something
<bobbertson>	then i guess you stopped me
<d_garbage>	is 'hip' hip though? :p
<bobbertson>	who cares
<bobbertson>	i do what i want
<bobbertson>	my opinion is fact
<halfwit>	no, i don't think any of the jonas brothers say hip.

<halosghost>	you may also like `sic`
<bobbertson>	a nice way for me to be able to avoid the complexities of the networking part and focus on creating an interface and features like i want
<sudokode>	well, ncurses clients are pretty easy to fiddle with anyway
<halfwit>	sudokode: oh feck yeat.
<sudokode>	or should be
<halfwit>	sudokode: yeah, even.
<sudokode>	?
<halosghost>	i could probably happily switch to ii/sic

<phrik>	halosghost: tada!
<halfwit>	it's your pc

<halfwit>	what does lsblk say?
<jeromelanteri>	this drive is not on special device like assmedia device...
<codebam>	whats the file format for an rsa key for ssh?
<codebam>	the private key
<jeromelanteri>	halfwit: lsblk not show him
<jeromelanteri>	the command show me all other
<jeromelanteri>	also the rom sr0

<phrik>	title: rfc 4716 - the secure shell (ssh) public key file format (at tools.ietf.org)
<jeromelanteri>	halfwit: normally, if the bios see it connected, it have to be seen by lsblk too..; right ?
<halfwit>	yeah, normally
<jeromelanteri>	so, what could be the problem ?
<halfwit>	i don't think i've ever not had one not show up
<jeromelanteri>	mmm ok.
<steelcowboy>	it's udev that creates the device files, correct?
<steelcowboy>	and hi there everyone!
<dacoit>	yup
<houn>	so.
<halfwit>	sew.
<houn>	if you ever have the option to splash hot oil on your arm, i recommend you politely decline.
<steelcowboy>	jeromelanteri: is it possible to plug and unplug the device and check dmesg?
<dacoit>	hes gone
<steelcowboy>	oh my, so he is... first time on irc, just registered :)
<dacoit>	;)
<steelcowboy>	is this channel particularily active? i.e. people get help on here frequently?
<dacoit>	very
<halfwit>	yeah!
<scimmia>	houn, better than on your face. believe me.
<houn>	scimmia: ow
<steelcowboy>	well everyone, i have come here seeking the ultimate truth: who is knghtbrd?
<steelcowboy>	fortune gives me comments by him every so often lol
<jeromelanteri>	i find the problem. on asrock extrem 6 z97, there is an option on the bios for tell him if it is an ssd drive or a normal hard drive. the ssd drive option enabled make it disapear on the lsblk
<jeromelanteri>	i don't know why. someone has same problem here ?
<steelcowboy>	hmmmmm interesting. does it still perform like an ssd though? if so it shouldn't be a problem
<abrarsyed>	installing on my new ssd from my current live system.. #archmasterrace :d
<jeromelanteri>	or maybe someone know what the difference between ssd bios selection or not on asrock mobo ?
<threegen>	asrock has some other bugs, right? or is that msi? some mobo's are just bad.
<houn>	steelcowboy: maybe this guy? http://www.advogato.org/person/knghtbrd/
<phrik>	title: advogato: personal info for knghtbrd (at www.advogato.org)
<jeromelanteri>	maybe. in fact yes, there is some problem with asmedia chipset, but from the mobo or not ? i don't know.
<jeromelanteri>	the fact is that if you enable the asmedia chip, you loose the usb boot... but if you disable it, you loose audio (cry)
<jeromelanteri>	bios updated at version 1.7
<jeromelanteri>	is there a channel for asrock mother board ?
<halfwit>	likely you will find the official forum to be the best tool
<jeromelanteri>	ok, thanks
<steelcowboy>	hmmmm, interesting. i just didn't get why he was included in fortunes a lot lol
<houn>	steelcowboy: may not be the same guy, but on the other hand, debian dev, so...
<houn>	maybe?
<steelcowboy>	houn: yeah, likely him. i have fortune in my zshrc :d
<steelcowboy>	i get them a lot ;)
<supergeek800>	unable to get the driver to compile in 3.14.40, even with linux-lts-headers installed.
<supergeek800>	fuuuck.
<codebam>	what are the disadvantages of using a socket over a service?
<supergeek800>	hope whatever's wrong is fixed in 3.14.41.
<gnea>	codebam: it accesses the filesystem directly
<supergeek800>	kinda risky running an unsupported anything.
<codebam>	gnea: sockets access my filesystem directly? and services dont?
<gnea>	codebam: it just does it in a different way. honestly, that's all that i could come up with. if a /dev/socketfile has global permissions, that could be problematic.
<codebam>	gnea: ah okay. so would there be disadvantages of using sshd.socket vs sshd.service?
<codebam>	sockets would use less ram i assume?
<supergeek800>	also, any chance of linux-lts318 becoming available in the aur or an unofficial repo?
<codebam>	supergeek800: wouldnt a lts kernel break the arch packages. since theyre sorta bleeding edge?
<supergeek800>	considering 3.18 is an officially-recognized lts kernel?
<scimmia>	supergeek800, sounds like you need to make one
<codebam>	like packages would be updating before the kernel supports them?
<supergeek800>	codebam: banking on just accepting that my computer's probably fucked in the ass on arch.
<codebam>	or they support the kernel... idk
<scimmia>	codebam, very few programs need a recent kernel
<codebam>	supergeek800: aha okay :p
<supergeek800>	4.0 won't even boot on it because of my gpu, 3.14.40 broke my wireless nic.
<codebam>	scimmia: ah okay.
<scimmia>	supergeek800, i know you were talking about trying mainline, any luck?
<supergeek800>	scimmia: even it didn't boot.
<scimmia>	that sux
<supergeek800>	scimmia: kernel-panicked on boot just like the stable 4.0 kernel, think it may have even had the same message.
<codebam>	when will we have live patching support...?
<codebam>	mainline is older than stable right now...
<supergeek800>	scimmia: 3.14.40 boots, just my wifi don't work on it, and the newest r8192 driver won't compile.
<codebam>	can you make menuconfig?
<codebam>	anyways... sleep :p night
<supergeek800>	scimmia: should've been pm'd with the full error output.
<scimmia>	supergeek800, yeah, i got it
<scimmia>	that error most likely means it either isn't including the correct header or it isn't compatible with that kernel
<supergeek800>	scimmia: and that's with the latest lts kernel and supporting headers from [core] installed.
<xyzaffa1r>	for once i decided to make my install nice and polished, i am deciding on a dm instead of just using startx and i am thinking of using lightdm, anything wrong with it?
<scimmia>	supergeek800, https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/6/23/446 pull request for that function, from last june.
<phrik>	title: lkml: joe perches: [patch 00/22] add and use pci_zalloc_consistent (at lkml.org)
<scimmia>	looking at release dates, it was probably added for 3.16
<d_garbage>	supergeek800, i don't really know if this is right - you check. the driver mentioned here from the 'chunkeey' repo builds here  https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1469635#p1469635
<phrik>	title: slow download speeds on arch compared to windows (belkin n300 usb) / newbie corner / arch linux forums (at bbs.archlinux.org)
<d_garbage>	i mentioned it earlier but i think you maybe left before noticing it. i had gone to bed but was just 'passing by' on a trip to the smallest room ;)
<xyzaffa1r>	also, when turning my computer on all those words go by during launch and those are ugly.
<supergeek800>	d_garbage: scimmia: both the kernel in question and the headers are at 3.14.40.
<xyzaffa1r>	is there a way to go straight to lightdm after grub2?
<supergeek800>	newest from [core].
<scimmia>	supergeek800, right, which is too old to have that function
<supergeek800>	i'm pu shit creek, lol.
<supergeek800>	*up
<threegen>	xyzaffa1r no there is not, and there never will be.
<d_garbage>	supergeek800, like i said i don't know if that's even the driver you want but it certainly builds here on 3.19.6-1-ck
<scimmia>	as i said before, nothing wrong with staying on 3.19
<threegen>	when your pc dies, that text will be all you have to save it.
<xyzaffa1r>	threegen, why not? they are so ugly :(
<scimmia>	supergeek800, but make sure to get that panic upstream so it gets fixed
<supergeek800>	scimmia: except if i stay on it long-tem, that's kinda putting the system a bit at risk.
<threegen>	xyzaffa1r because it has to activate the kernel before it can display graphics, it's how any pc in the world running linux works. at least your pc probably doesn't display a good 1000 lines on boot like at my work. takes about 2 mins to boot. :)
<threegen>	it's ugly there.
<threegen>	but if it bothers you that much, get an intel gpu with modesetting, and then have it display small text instead of big text.
<xyzaffa1r>	threegen, but ubuntu and such has no letter, just launchs to that ugly purple screen.
<supergeek800>	scimmia: no real way to copy down the exact info of the kernel panic, searched through dmesg, journald, everything no sign of the panic.
<threegen>	maybe, that's the splash screen. it's possible, but you have to have modesetting or you'll have a crappy graphic instead.
<threegen>	and if you press esc, you can see the crappy text because it's still needed when your computer goes down. :)
<supergeek800>	scimmia: honestly, that kinda pisses me off a little bit because a way to copy down the exact output of that panic would come in handy for reporting it, tbh.
<scimmia>	supergeek800, it would. simplest might be to take a picture of your screen
<supergeek800>	i could probably try to borrow a camera, the bit of info i managed to write down with a pen wouldn't tell shit.
<threegen>	i just remember what killed it.
<threegen>	remember the program, and then what layers killed the program/kernel.
<threegen>	it'll all be related, somewhat, so it's okay just to know _what did what_ as hell, even the numbers don't mean much because of pic.
<supergeek800>	threegen: well, i'm fairly certain the root cause is my gpu, uncertain past that.
<threegen>	well, whats the function list? what gpu? what were you doing that killed it?
<threegen>	if it's a ri 285x, thats your problem. :)
<threegen>	r9*
<supergeek800>	it panicked on boot, and it's a radeon x1150, so r300g driver.
<supergeek800>	fucking ancientass onboard, on an ancientass am2 sempron pc.
<threegen>	is it repock?
<threegen>	kernel version?
<threegen>	r300g is pretty set in stone, so probably not gpu related exactly, that's my guess. although with amd stuff you never can tell for sure. :)
<lswart>	hi all, i would like to change my dns to 8.8.8.8 (google's public dns) because i hear it is more reliable. i'm using systemd-networkd (and wpa_supplicant) for network management. per instructions under `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf`, can i create a file `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/newresolv.conf` to override my dns?
<supergeek800>	kernel version: 4.0.1-arch for stable, and 4.1rc2 mainline.
<supergeek800>	both kernel panicked on boot.
<threegen>	back down to 3.17-7
<supergeek800>	the goddamn stable kernel shouldn't have done that, meanwhile it's somewhat expected of mainline because it's in an rc state.
<threegen>	4.0.1 is causing trouble on repock for unknown reasons.
<threegen>	it's probably related,.
<supergeek800>	i'm on 3.19.3 currently.
<threegen>	does it work?
<supergeek800>	perfectly.
<lswart>	i am doing this because i had an issue with a public wifi dns today, where pinging ip directly worked but domain names didn't. after hardcoding `dns=8.8.8.8` under `/etc/resolv.conf`, my wifi worked, but i don't think this is a permanent solution. thus, i would like to use a more reliable dns like google's. any advice on changing my dns?
<threegen>	yeah, stay off of it. something is bugged in the kernel it's self
<supergeek800>	how long will it take to fix?
<threegen>	i've had the issue myself, on an fx-8350 with an gtx 970 superclocked.
<threegen>	3.17.7 repock for now. :)
<threegen>	i dunno, if they knew, it'd be fixed right this second. :)
<coolthingy500>	couldn't you guys install a lts kernel for a stopgap solution
<coolthingy500>	?
<ubone>	for 8510p 318 319 caused panic almost every boot
<supergeek800>	coolthingy500: not in my case, wireless is fucked on 3.14.40.
<threegen>	gotta let them iron it out, watch the linux github commits, and wait until they say "oops fuckup that made everyone panic has been fixed."
<coolthingy500>	sorry to hear that.
<supergeek800>	coolthingy500: hopefully it'll be fixed by 3.14.41 or something, not about to open up the testing repo to install it prematurely, learned my lesson the hard way by doing that.
<coolthingy500>	ditto
<ubone>	i wouldnt hope on a fix  in .41 unless there it is already resolved and being implemented
<coolthingy500>	supergeek800, i had some issues with a 3.19 back then. basically my trackpad on a toshiba wouldn't work sometimes.
<supergeek800>	if it's on a secondary machine, like a laptop or something, not as big a deal, but if it's your primary, or in my case, your only partially-usable machine, stay away from dev repos.
<xyzaffa1r>	i just realised my computer has been having trouble booting because i am a dumb a and used /dev/whatever instead of uuids for my fstab.
<coolthingy500>	yikes.
<xyzaffa1r>	proud of my self for reading errors and fixing my fstab though :)
<supergeek800>	for example, arch stable on your main desktop, fedora rawhide on your laptop.
<coolthingy500>	lswart, just try out opendns instead of google.
<coolthingy500>	i got arch stable right now on my thinkpad t410, manjaro openrc on my asus for my htpc, and my toshiba satalite with debian 8. shitty intel cpu though.
<supergeek800>	or ubuntu-next could go on said laptop, while ubuntu lts could go on said desktop, if you prefer running that distro, and are adept enough at the cli to build your system up from scratch.
<supergeek800>	(which even in ubuntu minimal, is easier slightly than arch because you've a curses interface for the installer, and then to set up a desktop is your standard one-liner like in any minimal iso (sudo apt-get install xorg blah blah blah)
<supergeek800>	(substitute apt-get with the minimal distro iso's respective package management syntax)
<threegen>	xyzaffa1r next time use -u when you install. :)
<coolthingy500>	if ubuntu can stop recoding their unity de for 1 year, and focus on actually making a solid system. well i might give ubuntu i try. unil then, forget it. too many issues with ubuntu kernels.
<supergeek800>	coolthingy500: that's where the server iso or the mini iso come into play. both leave you with a blank console similar to what you'd find in arch or gentoo, for you to build from, just one don't require a web connection.
<supergeek800>	to install, i mean.
<coolthingy500>	true. but the average guy trying that nightmare of a system will not know that.
<supergeek800>	(the server iso don't require a web connection to install iirc, while the mini iso operates similar to arch in which the oackages are grabbed off the web)
<supergeek800>	*packages
<coolthingy500>	i do like debain though. for what it is.
<edit>	 ಠ_ಠ  ಠ_ಠ                                                                                                                                                     :/
<coolthingy500>	even the net installer
<supergeek800>	coolthingy500: if i'm to go for a deb-based lts distro, it's going to be ubuntu lts for newer packages, plus afaik, canonical patches their kernel more than debian does, and for longer.
<threegen>	deb package manager needs fixed. the fact that it's possible to brick your system because ubuntu/mint can't keep their deps straight is pretty bad.
<coolthingy500>	supergeek800, i'm glad you like ubuntu. but ubuntu is one the reason i ended up to arch in the first place.
<threegen>	and thats not even their manager, it's the people running the show..
<supergeek800>	coolthingy500: plus debian's lts branch is unofficial, so it's not handled by the security division, unlike ubuntu's lts branch, and it's probably the best choice for an lts workstation distro because its packages are relatively new even in lts, while centos is better-sutied to server applications, although ubuntu's good on servers too,
<supergeek800>	arch or fedora would go on the home user's desktop meanwhile because for some reason, bleeding-edge doesn't seem like it'd work out very well vs. any lts distro in a serious environment.
<coolthingy500>	arch and fedora are for a personal type of system if you ask most people.
<supergeek800>	actually, i would get ragged on pretty hard if i tried to run a decent-scale server on arch. lmao
<threegen>	the best lts version is the one you never update anyway, anyway. :)
<supergeek800>	centos meanwhile is basically tailor-made for that type of application.
<threegen>	my employer, a big retail store, works that way. kernel 2.6.36 :)
<coolthingy500>	well for a personal fileshare server. you might be able to get away with it.
<coolthingy500>	but for networking. you might get a earfull.
<supergeek800>	ubuntu lts would be better for a workstation if you don't need maya or anything, and it also holds its own on servers.
<coolthingy500>	i'm sure it does. but i'll stick with debian or centos
<supergeek800>	(sans unity, of course, if it's aimed at as much productivity as possible, because blackbox or something would leave more resources free for blender or whatever)
<coolthingy500>	what do you use a server for supergeek800 ?
<supergeek800>	coolthingy500: if i were to set one up, it'd probably be used for keeping a backup copy of my shit.
<coolthingy500>	can you give me a share of your porno collection.
<coolthingy500>	?
<threegen>	lol.
<coolthingy500>	via ftp. haha
<threegen>	i had a friend "sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root /" my desktop like a month and a half ago.
<supergeek800>	coolthingy500: well, the largest part of my data is taken up with about 10gb worth of flac music files.
<threegen>	i didn't lose much. but when i do have stuff i can't lose, i'm making a backup server too. :p
<threegen>	10gb? so 2 albums? ;)
<threegen>	no seriously that's not too much....i have 14gb of flac. i don't have much...flac is beautiful. :d
<supergeek800>	according to audacious, got a little over 37 hours of stuff to listen to.
<coolthingy500>	too bad i can't find too many devices to play flac. well maybe on a mobile phone.
<supergeek800>	coolthingy500: if you're on arch, flac should be available in the repos if it isn't installed already.
<coolthingy500>	i meant when you want to travel with a portable device.
<supergeek800>	coolthingy500: look around for players that support flac and multiple os platforms.
<coolthingy500>	the list isn't good, but i'll check.
<supergeek800>	coolthingy500: or if you prefer ipods, the apple equivalent is alac/
<supergeek800>	but good luck getting them to run in linux unless you can rockbox them or something.
<maquis>	hi. i just installed archlinux for the first time, and i'm running into a problem. if i startx, and then leave x to go back to the virtual terminal, my virtual terminal starts wildly moving back and forth, and is unusable. i'm not certain where i should be looking to get information about what could be causing the issue.
<coolthingy500>	i smashed all of the apply devices in my room. selling them is not worth it. and that ipod nano that i turned into a bootable os. dumb mistake on my behalf.
<threegen>	maquis what is your gpu hardware?
<maquis>	it is just intel.
<supergeek800>	and just to verify what i've had a feeling of all along, it is a graphics problem with radeon in general with 4.*.*?
<threegen>	off, should be pretty stable under linux. i don't really know what to say...
<threegen>	supergeek800 it's a problem for every pc in the world with 4.*.* afaik.
<supergeek800>	threegen: even intel?
<threegen>	i've had panics, intel users had panics, my nvidia has had the panic, the intel cpus have had panics.
<maquis>	threegen: intel integrated broadwell-u
<threegen>	maquis i'm not sure on that, never really troubleshooted intel because it's always worked. i don't really know what to say, sorry.

<maquis>	threegen: no worries. thanks for asking.
<threegen>	supergeek800 whatcha mean?
<supergeek800>	threegen: like if 4.0.1 is kernel-panicking even on intel's current/newest stuff.
<supergeek800>	as opposed to almost-decade-old hardware like i have?
<threegen>	it is, some i7 peeps reported panics.
<threegen>	i run an fx-8350, i panicked.
<threegen>	it's everyones issue.
<threegen>	so it's an error, somewhere, somehow, with something. they're just tracking it down. it's a hard one, because it's been a few days.
<threegen>	just watch git commits. or search yourself. :)
<threegen>	4.0.1 worked afaik. :p
<threegen>	i forget when it died...just last week...so whenever that was.
<supergeek800>	like unbootable, or it panic later on when it was booted in those cases or what?
<threegen>	both.
<threegen>	i had boot panicks.
<threegen>	i had random crashes to nothing.
<threegen>	and then my first one was an in-game panic.
<threegen>	so it happens every which way.
<threegen>	i had more on boot myself, though/
<threegen>	but i only stayed on the broken kernel for 3 tries. i switched after, knowing i updated the kernel, recerting back to stock.

<sanga>	yes now in 3.16 even that door is closed
<hwkiller>	sanga: why is that door closed?
<sanga>	i don't know what is their philosophy with making it harder to do little things, rest of 3.16 is an improvement but this is a let down.
<qubitnerd>	i hate gnomes thick top bar too .. that .. and window decorations and websites with thick fixed headers and you might aswell saw off the top half of your screen
<sanga>	there is no easily editable gnome-shell.css file for the new adwaita theme.
<qubitnerd>	have you considered using a wm ?
<sanga>	it's not the same thing, i use i3 though
<qubitnerd>	o.o .. so is it i3 or gnome-shell
<sanga>	qubitnerd: don't be so reductive
<qubitnerd>	okay
<supergeek800>	got rid of linux-lts, installed linux-mainline again from the miffe repo to test and see if 4.*.* will be bootable any time soon, so that i can finally upgrade the linux package.
<supergeek800>	the linux package that is being held back for system usability reasons is still the primary kernel.
<kodur>	anyone with experience in having tiling in openbox?
<supergeek800>	3.19.3 was the last fully-functional kernel my system booted, so i'm keeping it as long as is feasible.
<sledgehammer>	kodur, no experience, but i'm curious why you wouldn't just use a tiling wm instead?
<kodur>	sledgehammer: i tried using xmonad and i was having a bunch of problems configuring it. i am use to openbox so it would be nice to keep using it, but i would like tiling for my laptop
<qubitnerd>	kodur: try i3
<caleb>	i3 ftw
<gjm>	i5
<devgrohl>	i7 bitches
<jushur>	zero problems here with 4.0.x , amd apu e450, intel i7/i3 systems works flawless. then again it could be the fact i dont oc at all. and have turned of some things in the bios.
<jushur>	ck kernel panics under pressure situations tho, so running vanilla kernels atm
<kodur>	qubitnerd: i guess i'll give it a shot
<fckr>	kodur: i found xmonad easier to configure than i3, but maybe that's just me.  you could try awesome as well
<dan39>	how does awesome handle multi-head virtual desktops? i still love using xmonad because of the way it does
<fckr>	dan39: when i used awesome i had 2 sets of workspaces, one for each monitor
<dan39>	o, bummer.
<dan39>	that seems to be the more common approach, or having each virtual desktop contain both monitors
<fckr>	yeah, im not sure if it could have been configured differently, but i like having one set of workspaces between both of my monitors in xmonad
<dan39>	unlike xmonad where each monitor views a virtual desktop, and they pick from the same set
<dan39>	ive been on a quest to find a good wm that does the same thing well
<qubitnerd>	and shifting to workspace n would shift to workspace n on all the monitors
<dan39>	not saying xmonad isnt good, just curious to try others
<lswart>	coolthingy500: thanks for the opendns tip! but is there a reason why you would suggestion opendns over googledns?
<lswart>	doing some research, it seems they are both proprietary, and perform similarly
<shadowkatstudios>	opendns being non-open seems ironic.
<jushur>	dnschain ftw

<tylerdurden01>	err, do i need to configure flashplugin for pulseaudio in some way so that i can play music on my mpd and watch a video on youtube at the same time because i can't do that right now
<coolthingy500>	sorry i was watching something. but to answer your question. from past experience, when it comes to google. the only good thing i find google good at is maps, and a search engine. anything else is kinda of a toss up.
<gogoprog>	tylerdurden01: did you install pulseaudio-alsa ?
<coolthingy500>	i got the info about looking for alternative dns servers from link: https://prism-break.org/en/

<gogoprog>	tylerdurden01: i guess yes; flashplugin must be working with alsa
<coolthingy500>	iswart although a open dns that works is opennic, i had some issues with the set up in the past due to my hardware set up. so i sticked with opendns until i can learn more about networking.

<phrik>	title: gnu/linux - platforms - prism break (at prism-break.org)
<lswart>	coolthingy500: good info, thanks. it seems that google's business model extend far beyond mapping and search engine, and is more into predictive analytics. so i suppose googledns vs opendns is not a performance issue, but an ethics issue.
<coolthingy500>	something like that.
<jushur>	if you want secure dns, neither google or opendns is. actually google dns has caused a lot of headakes last year. sure they fix it very fast. but the damage is done even faster.
<demonicmaniac3>	and google knows every adress you ever visit
<coolthingy500>	you can at best minimize it. but that's why i avoid using stuff like google as much as i can.
<tazmain>	hi all, i keep getting the error error constructing proxy for org.gnome.terminal:/org/gnome/terminal/factory0: the connection is closed" does anyone know how to solve this ?

<tylerdurden01>	is ublock better and/or faster than adblock plus?
<kurobeats>	both
<kurobeats>	lighter too
<tylerdurden01>	hmm. i'll try it.

<h8lvmetad1>	hello, i'm currently trying to install arch on my laptop using lvm on top of luks and i keep getting errors regarding lvmetad while trying to generate the grub configuration. my partition scheme is /dev/sda1 is the /boot partition, /dev/sda2 is the lvm volume. sda2 appears as lvm in parted and i put the encrypt and lvm2 hooks in mkinitcpio before t
<h8lvmetad1>	he filesystems hooks and it still won't work. what am i missing?
<dan39>	doesnt sound like your lvm is setup correctly. have you done lvm before?
<dan39>	you dont just set the partition as an lvm...
<tylerdurden01>	damn, creating nglayout.initialpaint.delay and setting it to 0 in firefox's about:config page makes page rendering quite noticeably faster :o
<h8lvmetad1>	how do i set the lvm partion correctly?
<h8lvmetad1>	the partition type appears to be lvm even without the flag.
<jasonwryan>	h8lvmetad1: just ignore it…
<h8lvmetad1>	i rebooted and grub can't locate the root partition even though i set it in /etc/default/grub
<h8lvmetad1>	seeing grub revert to rootfs when trying to boot just became my nightmare.
<jasonwryan>	grub is a nightmare…
<h8lvmetad1>	what else can i do without reinstalling and going through another failure that fucks up my morale?
<jasonwryan>	chroot in an fix your grub config
<h8lvmetad1>	i tried disbling submenu and lvmetad in lvm.conf
<jasonwryan>	don't do that
<h8lvmetad1>	grub still hits me with a brick over the head with a brick
<jasonwryan>	you want lvmetad enabled: the error is irrelevant
<h8lvmetad1>	it's relevant as long as grub sends me to rootfs hell
<jasonwryan>	you have misconfigured grub; the lvmetad error has nothing to do with it
<h8lvmetad1>	i can only hide it disabling submenu or lvmetad but that only covers the errors while generating the config
<h8lvmetad1>	is it possible that i wrote the cryptsetup stuff wrong in the cmd line?
<jasonwryan>	yes
<jasonwryan>	but it is more likely that grub is misconfigured
<lswart>	hi, can someone help me reconfigure my defuault dns? i can't seem to remove the defualt dns, although i'm able to add a new dns by creating a file under `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/resolv.conf`. still, the defualt dns ip's appear in my `/etc/resolv.conf`, even after i delete them and restart with `systemctl restart systemd-resolved`. i am using `systemd-networkd` for my network managment.
<lswart>	per `resolved.conf`, i double checked to ensure the default dns's were not under /etc/systemd/resolved.conf, /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/*.conf, /etc/resolv.conf, or /usr/lib/systemd/resolved.conf.d/*.conf

<jswagner>	i'll have to look at some examples for generating .desktop files
<dagle>	i have weird problem lately, sometimes after suspending to ram, i can't wake the machine and then after rebooting it takes about 5 min to start it (and it spends 5 min in early boot code, so no output during this time) and checking systemd or dmesg gives me nothing but bgrt invalid status and unkown event: 1.
<tomty89>	the error is probably irrelevant and harmless
<tomty89>	(i got that as well)
<dagle>	i know those aint the problem.
<dagle>	but it's all i got.
<dagle>	a not having suspend working and the machine taking 5 min to boot at random times isn't irrelevant though. :p
<dagle>	but if i would do a clean reboot now, it would boot as normal.
<tomty89>	but after the five minutes it boot?
<tomty89>	or it just hang forever
<dagle>	it boots after 5 min.
<dagle>	the screen is black for 5 min, with the bgrt written, then after 5 min it boots like normal.
<dagle>	and it only does this after suspend has failed.
<tomty89>	dagle: are you booting with the quiet param?
<tomty89>	dagle: try remove that from your bootloader entry and see
<dagle>	tomty89: nope, the output comes, but after 5 min.
<tomty89>	oh
<tomty89>	well see if you left any garbage in mkinitcpio.conf and regen the images?
<dagle>	tomty89: i use gummiboot with only a default setting.
<dagle>	i haven't edited mkinitcpio.conf and i haven't needed to do that before.
<tomty89>	no hardware change recently?
<dagle>	also, i get the feeling that the kernel isn't even at that stage where mkinitcpio would matter.
<dagle>	no, it's a laptop.
<tomty89>	can you paste the `journalctl -b` of a boot that it happend?
<dagle>	tomty89: http://ix.io/iok

<dagle>	yes
<dagle>	you can't see that in that log.
<dagle>	because systemd has to run.
<dagle>	and systemd isn't running when it happens.
<tomty89>	wat?
<dagle>	you know how the linux kernel boots?
<tomty89>	dagle: but one entry is even you running sudo pacman -syu
<dagle>	you know how the linux kernel boots?
<tomty89>	dagle: you mean you can't give a boot log of that or what?
<dagle>	this is before the kernel is running c code
<dagle>	something fishy is happening in the asm.
<dagle>	so, the kernel isn't even running c code.
<joshsyn>	any good alternative to mysql-workbench for mariadb?
<tomty89>	i have no idea about what you're talking about
<tomty89>	you mean the time is wrong?
<tomty89>	or fake?
<dagle>	systemd isn't running yet.
<dagle>	init() hasn't started to run.
<tomty89>	what does this have to do with systemd
<dagle>	my problem has nothing to do with systemd.
<tomty89>	bah i bail
<dagle>	the kernel hangs for 5 min before init() and userspace happens. so systemd() isn't running, most likely c code isn't running, there isn't any userspace yet etc.
<dagle>	so, systemd doesn't have any clue what happend because it didn't see it because it happened before it started.
<joshsyn>	is there a repository for heidisql????
<a-109-107>	joshsyn: aur/heidisql
<tomty89>	dagle: okay i guess get what you are talking about

<tomty89>	eh? activex is finally gone?
<omar007>	do you mean the spartan browser? because that is now named edge
<namarrgon>	now flash needs to die, too
<omar007>	so unless they also renamed the engine, it no longer bears the same name
<tomty89>	omar007: didn't they call the engine edge since ie11
<tomty89>	i know nothing about the name spartan
<omar007>	i guess i've been out of the ie loop for to long then xd
<dosamp>	"edge" was originally for "use the latest ie features"
<dosamp>	as in the http header "x-ua-compatible: ie=edge"
<omar007>	did anyone ever use that header? :o
<dosamp>	yes
<dosamp>	i have some sites here that have <meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=7; ie=8" />
<dosamp>	makes ie7 render in ie7 standards mode, ie8 and higher in ie8 mode
<dosamp>	(because the site breaks with the increased standards compatibility of ie9/10)
<tomty89>	lol chromium doesn't support pcf font
<omar007>	isn't that kinda doing the opposite of what that header was designed for? xd
<omar007>	creative use for the 'use new features' header i guess
<dosamp>	it was an ie hack all along anyway (any header prefixed x- isn't in the http standard)
<dosamp>	that was retrofitted onto chromium at some point
<omar007>	^ that's why i asked if anyone even used it :p
<omar007>	tbh i stopped using ie since windows xp
<omar007>	and now that i'm using linux as my main os i've pretty much lost track of ie developments a bit.. :/
<tylerdurden01>	anyone know if this means something? i google'd up what -22 could possibly mean, but i can't find anything http://sprunge.us/afkc
<tigr>	tylerdurden01, is from dmesg?  is there something in particular wrong, or are you just curious?
<tomty89>	tylerdurden01: invalid argument probably
<tylerdurden01>	tigr: yes, from dmesg. i suspect that something might be wrong since sensors gives me this http://sprunge.us/afkc

<tylerdurden01>	tigr: i'm afraid that if there's something going wrong with the thermal stuff, my laptop won't cool down the components properly
<tigr>	the 2 so is that output from dmesg or from sensors?  it's the same link.  you implied they would be different
<tylerdurden01>	tigr: oh, sorry. this is the proper sensors output http://sprunge.us/gecf
<tylerdurden01>	:d
<tylerdurden01>	tigr: as you can see, it shows temp1 at 6000+c
<tigr>	no.  it shows at +41.0°c
<tylerdurden01>	tigr: then what's with the 6000c thing?
<lswart>	alright, it late but i resolved my dns change situation. i simply added the flag `[dhcp]\nusedns=false` to my network profiles under `/etc/systemd/network/*.network` to disable the dhcp connection from adding its own dns. now i am only using the dns of my choice!
<tigr>	tylerdurden01, google this, you'll get some results   temp1:       +6280.0°c  "asus-isa-0000"
<dagle>	hmmm.
<dagle>	downgrading the kernel seems to fix stuff.
<tylerdurden01>	tigr: hmm. one result says that it's just a minor bug.
<tigr>	tylerdurden01, awesome
<tigr>	it looks like the critical temp is 105c    core 0:       +41.0°c  (high = +105.0°c, crit = +105.0°c)
<dagle>	i bet it was allans fault.
<tigr>	tylerdurden01, which is probably where you machine will shut down to protect itself
<tylerdurden01>	tigr: hasn't happened yet, but i'm getting graphical errors sometimes :o
<tigr>	ahh
<tigr>	any messages about that?
<tigr>	"sometimes".  that's a pita.  any messages in xorg.log or ... i think it's .xerrors  ?
<tylerdurden01>	tigr: they only happen in firefox/chrome if i use something like google earth
<tigr>	dagle, blaming your problem on allan?  could be falconindy
<tigr>	tylerdurden01, how much ram do you have?  latest version of firefox/chrome?
<tylerdurden01>	tigr: 4gb and i have the latest version
<tylerdurden01>	tigr: actually, before initramfs (i think), my text appears garbled and i can't change grub's resolution to 1366x768 no matter what i set in grub.conf
<dagle>	tigr: well, suspend stoped working and it takes 5 min to reboot after the suspend has crashed. downdrading the kernel fixed it. blaming allan.
<tylerdurden01>	*in grub
<amcrae>	kernel is nothing to do with me...
<tigr>	dagle, ahhh.  off with his head!
<amcrae>	give me op!  i'll get rid of this treasonous scum
<amcrae>	yay!
<dagle>	amcrae: it's you aura, not what you command.
<dagle>	your*
<cirrus_minor>	queries from naive manjaro linux users. and they must be naive because the are still using manjaro linux - allan mcrae
<cirrus_minor>	:)
<dagle>	i wonder what makes the kernel takes 5 min to boot though.
<cirrus_minor>	i actually has that as weechat alias
<amcrae>	cirrus_minor: not far wrong...
<dagle>	5 min in early boot code with no debugging, i was lucky i took a shit before turning it off.
<jushur>	dagle: what sheduller you use?
<dagle>	jushur: it's the stock kernel.
<tigr>	tylerdurden01, that's way beyond my level of experience
<amcrae>	dagle: feel like doing some bisecting?
<jushur>	dagle: and the stock kernel still has more then one choise on that ;)
<dagle>	jushur: i'm using what arch fed me.
<jushur>	i run all my systems with noop, as i only have ssd in all machines.
<dagle>	jushur: i'm not sure the scheduler is even running when it happens.
<dagle>	amcrae: can i blame you? then yes.
<tigr>	tylerdurden01, but i would ask - anything in dmesg or journalctl that looks like it might be relevant?
<tylerdurden01>	tigr: meah, i'll keep googling on my own. thanks for trying, though :d
<amcrae>	dagle: kernel issues are rarely solved without the person seeing them doing bisecting
<dagle>	amcrae: well, it happens when i do a long suspend, so 1 hour to trigger it... which is annoying.
<amcrae>	well, you will have lots of fun then :p
<tigr>	would be great if there was a message saying, "my text is garbled!  halp!!!"
<tylerdurden01>	tigr: i don't mind it, but i'm afraid that it might be a sign that i'm doing something wrong :o
<dagle>	sounds like a problem for future me, when i'm at home with a spare computer.
<nkparadox>	dagle: you got long boot time?
<dagle>	nkparadox: only when i trigger a kernel bug.
<tigr>	tylerdurden01, does it happen in other oses?  has it always done it, or just recently?  if it's recent, what got changed right before it started?
<dagle>	nkparadox: when i trigger that bug, it takes 5 min with the screen black for 5 min.
<nkparadox>	dagle: did you tried systemd-analyze blame
<dagle>	nkparadox: systemd isn't running at that point.
<nkparadox>	dagle: to see where it hangs all this time!
<dagle>	init isn't running.
<dagle>	nkparadox: systemd isn't running at that point.
<tylerdurden01>	tigr: the garbled text part? happens only in archlinux. haven't tested it on other distributions (because i'm not a traitor!).
<dagle>	systemd can't debug it.
<nkparadox>	dagle: so it happens before systemd! hmm...
<amcrae>	tylerdurden01: you can keep your head...  for now
<jushur>	dagle: this is exactly why i wondered wich sheduller you use.
<dagle>	jushur: yes but i think it happens even before the scheduler happens.
<tylerdurden01>	hmm. haven't checked the grub wiki page.
<dagle>	like really early.
<dagle>	or before the scheduler has any effect at least.
<nkparadox>	dagle: you think it might be based on a hardware fail?
<jushur>	dagle: i actually dont think so, as that would mean you have not actually called kernel at that stage?
<dagle>	because early in the process of booting the kernel, it starts printing some debug info, before systemd cleans the screen and prints init, i get nothing.
<inad922>	how can i get around the --asroot issue with yaourt?
<dagle>	nkparadox: works with the older kernel.
<amcrae>	not using yaourt....
<dagle>	but yeah, there is a software bug with my hardware, might be buggy software, might be buggy hardware. the thing is that it doesn't work.
<tigr>	tylerdurden01, nah.  the first step in debugging is to pinpoint when it happens.  i would suggest booting the installer, if you still have it.  if it's still there, try a live cd/usb of a different distro or a bsd or if you have windows on your machine.  the traitor would be if your moved to that permanently   ;)
<dagle>	jushur: depends on what you mean with calling the kernel, it has a boot protocol, then an init protocol, then it does jump to main() and then start the scheduler and do some other stuff and jumps to init(). it could be before even the jump to main().
<tylerdurden01>	tigr: when i had to install archlinux, i had to append nomodeset to the boot args thingy because otherwise it would just show me a black screen
<inad922>	amcrae: thx, that's helpful
<amcrae>	any time
<tylerdurden01>	brb
<jushur>	dagle: this is true at cooldboots yes, or a reboot. but this isnt your case right?
<dagle>	jushur: i try to resume from a suspend, it hangs, i power toggle the machine and coldboot it again -> 5 min boot.
<dagle>	and the filesystems are fine, i have checked.
<dagle>	but after that boot, i can coldboot or reboot just fine.
<jushur>	dagle: is it a desktop? or a laptop with battery?
<dagle>	laptop
<dagle>	and i had it pluged in or without.
<jushur>	dagle: i bet you need to unplug your battery to get a real cooldboot
<jushur>	dagle: got fastboot option in bios, and its toggled enabled? if so it will not actually cooldboot. just so you know.
<dagle>	nope.
<jushur>	some bios have it mangled with usb legacy, when you disable that it enters "fastboot enabled" to. some toshiba laptops i have do this. and its very anoying if you dont know about it.
<keto>	is there a way to show an image instead of the kernel-, sysctl- and xorgmessages on startup?
<hyo0301>	ded
<d_garbage>	keto, called a splash screen
<d_garbage>	keto, things like 'plymouth'
<keto>	thanks for the cue
<throstur>	i just created a new rule to blacklist some modules, how do i now disable the newly blacklisted modules so that my device uses the right driver?
<`zombeh>	installing arch and getting this error: 'error: failed retrieving file 'core.db' from <mirror> : resolving timed out after 10520ms' - any thoughts on this, i'm connected directly with an ethernet cable.
<jushur>	`zombeh: got a proper dns server?
<`zombeh>	how exactly do you set up dns from the command line?
<namarrgon>	throstur: unload the blacklisted module and load the one you need
<`zombeh>	it's going through this long list of mirrors still (full length of my monitor now)
<hyo0301>	how do you add locate to bash
<wasamasa>	hyo0301: install `mlocate`
<hyo0301>	want to find real path to weechat.conf
<hyo0301>	thanks
<wasamasa>	do the initial update with `sudo updatedb`
<wasamasa>	then you can `locate weechat.conf`
<earnestly>	find / -print > loldatabase; grep 'weechat\.conf' loldatabase # faster than locate
<jushur>	ausseh: well it depends, it should be automaticly done when you got the ip to your network connection. but if the network is in bad shape for any reason (many isp seem to have issues handling a proper dns server..) thus you get this kinda errors.
<wasamasa>	earnestly: i wonder whether it can get better by gzipping it, then using `ag -z` on it
<ausseh>	i may have a dns issue; i don't know. suppose i could set up opendns or googledns in my router...? not certain that'll help. i hope this works as i've accidentally wiped my winblows partition in the process of setting this up. >:|
<jushur>	ausseh: just edit /etc/resolv.conf and add nameserver 8.8.8.8 at the top for a google one
<wasamasa>	!ops
<phrik>	demize, escondida, falconindy, grawity, heftig, jelle, mrelendig/mion, tigrmesh/tigr, wonder/ioni, vodik – "release the kraken", yells wasamasa
<throstur>	gosh darn it, i thought rmmod unloaded the module
<tigr>	what's up, wasamasa ?
<dagle>	tigr: url posted above
<jushur>	ausseh: did you get my msg about edit /etc/resolv.conf?
<tigr>	subtle.  blends in.  and search for http didn't find it.  and grep for "www" would't have found it either
<throstur>	pinging 8.8.8.8 with the interface doesn't work, i shoudl probably just reboot...
<wasamasa>	like, !ops spam
<wasamasa>	which would then turn into "<list of ops> - <unfunny note> - <my nick>: <my note>"
<wasamasa>	the url above links to some streaming website btw
<throstur>	f#ck yeah, finally internet.
<oats>	throstur: it's ok, you can swear on the internet
<d_garbage>	wasamasa, i think you can do that, just do !ops <blah> and it ignores the <blah> at least that works in /query
<d_garbage>	not gonna try that here :p
<wasamasa>	d_garbage: it would need to be an alias for that to work
<d_garbage>	not really, i think the op is bright enough to look at your last line :p
<wasamasa>	well...
<d_garbage>	lol
<jeromelanteri>	someone know a good docuentation link for qemu ?
<ausseh>	i'm guessing i can play minecraft on arch, as well as install programs via wine, such as mirc and possibly photoshop?
<earnestly>	ausseh: arch is linux
<earnestly>	wine runs on linux (and osx)
<moetunes>	!give jeromelanteri wiki qemu
<earnestly>	whatever works in wine on linux, works on arch.  there is no arch
<phrik>	jeromelanteri: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/qemu
<earnestly>	it's just linux
<jeromelanteri>	not this one, a "good" one (where i can find more usual information)
<earnestly>	jeromelanteri: qemu's own documention is pretty comprehensive
<jeromelanteri>	maybe not for my little level...
<ausseh>	but is it theoretically possible to run a program such as photoshop via wine? i know it's a memory hog and i don't know if wine could withstand that.
<wasamasa>	ausseh: plenty of people are using it via wine
<pid1>	ausseh, check the wine website. they have compatibility lists.
<jeromelanteri>	ausseh: if you need to use graphic card full stuff... not with wine.
<wasamasa>	ausseh: i've got cs2 here as it works best (and is available free of charge for license holders)
<jeromelanteri>	ausseh: that is why i try to install qemu and kvm for have pci passthrough with the vt-d support
<wasamasa>	ausseh: why the hell would you want to use the windows versions of mirc and minecraft though
<ausseh>	interesting... those were nearly the only things tying me to windows.
<earnestly>	well, mirc is windows only but linux surely has better available, idk
<jeromelanteri>	ausseh: but for someone who not have a good level of linux administration, it would not be so easy to do it.
<wasamasa>	mirc is like the most annoying irc client ever
<dagle>	doesn't irssi support mirc scripts?
<dagle>	"support"
<jeromelanteri>	i search a documentation more accessible about qemu for "low level peoples"
<varav>	hey guys, i just ran `systemd-analyze blame` and at the top of the list i've got `dev-sda1.device`, any idea how i can reduce the time it takes
<ausseh>	i thought mirc was developed only for windows... i have a lot of user scripts i've created.
<ausseh>	i agree, however, i've got my scripts. i think irssi is python or perl, or something like that.
<pid1>	ausseh, i'm sure you can move those userscripts to another client. hexchat can support whatever custom commands you want.
<wasamasa>	irssi is c and supports plenty perl plugins
<wasamasa>	weechat supports more languages for plugins
<dagle>	acme supports even more.
<jeromelanteri>	i undersatnd for create the qemu image disk, but how to install an os from an iso file with qemu ?
<jeromelanteri>	on qcow2
<jeromelanteri>	an iso file and not from cdrom
<wasamasa>	boot from that file
<xybot514>	i setup a vm using qemu to run a minecraft server for my kids.   having issues installing.  anybody here can help?
<earnestly>	jeromelanteri: boot the iso via -cdrom
<jeromelanteri>	lol
<jeromelanteri>	earnestly: -cdrom is not the cdrom, but just the option for tell him to mounbt iso file ? (it s confused)
<jeromelanteri>	choice one: "yes" choice two: "no"
<xybot514>	how do i turn of sudo pass?   that is my issue.
<earnestly>	jeromelanteri: http://wiki.qemu.org/manual http://qemu.weilnetz.de/qemu-doc.html#sec_005finvocation
<phrik>	title: manual - qemu (at wiki.qemu.org)
<earnestly>	jeromelanteri: e.g. qemu-system-x86_64 -boot order=c -smp 2 -m 512 -k en-gb -drive file=nixos.raw,if=virtio,index=0,media=disk -enable-kvm -cdrom ~/net/nixos-minimal-14.04.449.e64237c-x86_64-linux.iso nixos.raw
<earnestly>	welcome to qemu command-lines
<jeromelanteri>	earnestly: very good.
<mkoskar>	i'm wondering if `awk` does "optimize" such that it doesn't split records into fields if it's not needed by program, or if one can tell it to do it, ... in my script i do only record (line) manipulations
<earnestly>	jeromelanteri: be sure to read what each option does in the qemu-doc
<earnestly>	because i won't
<jeromelanteri>	i hope to not sink myself in a little cup of coffee (crying)
<earnestly>	i'm sure you can read
<jeromelanteri>	ok, i will take the time to really unerstand (or think to understand) all of that, because many thinks are confused for me at tjis time. but thanks again for your exemple command line (it will be a great help exemple for link thinks to understand)
<jeromelanteri>	yes, i will
<dagle>	or just google qemu tutorial and look for the 10 flags used most often.
<earnestly>	dagle: i've given that
<jeromelanteri>	yes sure... i'm a little bit lazy sometimes (many times really)
<earnestly>	either that, or use something else, because qemu is like this
<earnestly>	i didn't include more tricky networking stuff
<jeromelanteri>	i absolutly need qmeu and kvm because of my f.... gtx nvidia graphic card
<jeromelanteri>	and i read that gtx750 can only maybe be passthrough by qemu and kvm (not by vmware)
<jeromelanteri>	so... tell me good luck guys
<jelle>	wasamasa: o/
<jelle>	oh grawity was first :(
<wasamasa>	jelle: yes
<wasamasa>	jelle: doesn't mean you're obsolete though or anything
<jelle>	:p
<earnestly>	jeromelanteri: you need two gpus for passthrough
<jeromelanteri>	i have two: one intel onboard and one nvidia on pci
<earnestly>	that may work
<jeromelanteri>	yes. intel for linux, and nvidia for windows by qemu kvm
<jeromelanteri>	(diplayport on intel one, dvi on nvidia one together linked to the same monitor => just change source) and hdmi for each one on the other tv monitor (source hdmi1 and hdmi2)
<a-109-107>	since around a linux 4 what used to be xf86launch1 key doesn't send keycodes anymore, nor do backlight shortcut keys work; i have a thinkpad - what am i missing?
<jeromelanteri>	just afraid about the nvidia gtx750 limitation by nvidia (limitation choosed by nvidia and lock pci passthrough by vm aware)
<jelle>	i'm afraid you don't have iommu
<jeromelanteri>	with intel, it is vt-d
<jeromelanteri>	iommu is for amd (right ?)
<jelle>	well you need it for your motherboard too
<jeromelanteri>	i have (asrock z97 extrem6)
<jeromelanteri>	option on bios is enabled
<teraflop>	jeromelanteri: it depends on your hw, but at first intel+nvidia sounds ok.
<jeromelanteri>	yeah i hope too... o read a post of someone who has to weld resistors on card for just make it recognize has quatro one...
<tylerdurden01>	hardcore
<jeromelanteri>	yes... i hope to not have to do that (i have initiale formation electronic, but i not have the datasheet of the card)
<jeromelanteri>	and they never provide pictures of the good side of the card in ads... (they are not so stupid)
<jeromelanteri>	i will tell you when i will arrive to do it.
<jeromelanteri>	(and maybe before i will ask you some other f.... newbies questions lol)
<dagle>	jeromelanteri: no, vt-d is an extention to the iommu.
<jeromelanteri>	ho yes ?
<dagle>	both amd and intel have an iommu.
<jeromelanteri>	what is iommu exactly ?
<dagle>	iommu isn't even limited to x86, arm and sparc have them too.
<jeromelanteri>	ok, i will read more around that.
<jeromelanteri>	(pain my little head allready)
<dagle>	an io mmu translates a device address.
<jeromelanteri>	ok, io for "input/output" and mmu for... mmu.
<dagle>	what vt-d does is that it makes it possible to translate the address so the os running inside the virtual machine gets translated to the real hardware.
<jeromelanteri>	very good explain
<demonicmaniac3>	the term iommu sums it up nicely
<jeromelanteri>	then if my mother board have vt-d option in the bios, sure he has the iommu to... right ?
<demonicmaniac3>	memory management unit for i/o devices and their mapped memory
<jeromelanteri>	so the iommu is on the mother board or on the graphic card ?
<shapeshifter>	does someone have a tip how to speed up reconnection to wlan/dhcp after coming back from suspend? it takes at least 10s currently. shouldn't it be possible to do this more quickly? there was some talk about rfc4436 used by macs to reconnect within 1s or so. i think the basic trick is to simply try using the previously used ip address and only re-lease if that fails. is no such thing available in li
<jeromelanteri>	or is is only a soft layer
<shapeshifter>	nux?
<dagle>	well, you didn't need an iommu back in the days, because limited sets of io staticly maped etc.
<demonicmaniac3>	jeromelanteri: the iommu is on the board - but a gpu still has to support it
<demonicmaniac3>	xen wiki has a list of which cards do support it
<jeromelanteri>	ok
<dagle>	the iommu is a part of the cpu but it might require some support from the motherboard.
<wasamasa>	shapeshifter: use systemd-networkd
<earnestly>	or dhclient
<earnestly>	or networkmanagers new dhcp client (written by connman devs, or use conmman)
<dagle>	or get a mac and do it all in the kernel?
<earnestly>	dagle: lol, ours is faster than osx crap
<wasamasa>	dagle: with systemd-networkd i regain internet connection at the same speed as on an os x laptop
<earnestly>	possiblyone of the worst operating systems when you look under the covers
<wasamasa>	dagle: so, nothx
<dagle>	obv i was trolling.
<earnestly>	wasamasa: dhclient is pretty good
<earnestly>	dagle: does osx even do dhcp in the kernel?
<dagle>	also, i have done regex in the windows kernel and shiped it.
<dagle>	earnestly: they did, dunno if they do.
<dagle>	all 3g and 4g drivers for windows xp and vista did string parsing inside the kernel, be afraid.
<earnestly>	heh
<krumelmonster>	if i put https://github.com/d-programming-deimos (d-header-only bindings for various libraries) on aur. should i make one package per library or can i also create one pkgbuild for all the deimos bindings?
<phrik>	title: d-programming-deimos · github (at github.com)
<dagle>	krumelmonster: yes.
<krumelmonster>	so yes, one package per library? and then set group to d-programming-deimos?
<dagle>	will somebody install one part or will it just be a pita because it "feels like the right thing to do"?
<krumelmonster>	dagle: what's a pita? i don't understand...
<tazmain>	hi all, does anyone know how to setup a pptp vpn connection with pap.chap ?
<wasamasa>	it's a tasty treat
<tylerdurden01>	do you guys recommend disabling the intel integrated gpu and using only the nvidia one on a laptop?
<wasamasa>	it's also an acronym for a pain in the butt
<braindamage>	krumelmonster: it's a type of flatbread
<gogoprog>	tylerdurden01: no
<wasamasa>	tylerdurden01: if anything, i'd do it the other way around
<jackdaniel>	tylerdurden01: the opposite :p
<tylerdurden01>	i'm not concerned about batery life, forgot to mention
<jackdaniel>	i have nouveau driver and use nvidia gpu on demand (offloading)
<krumelmonster>	dagle: either way it's gonna be pkgbuilds and no types of bread at all.
<jackdaniel>	it's way more silent, and doesn't eat battery
<tylerdurden01>	jackdaniel: i'm more concerned about heating the gpu and degrading it than the battery
<tylerdurden01>	although i won't put it on heavy load most of the time
<krumelmonster>	wasamasa: it wouldn't be pain in the but to have one package for all of it but it might be pain in the but to have to manually install each package if you'd wanted all of them. are package groups possible in aur as they are in the repositories?
<tylerdurden01>	so, considering what i just said, is using just the nvidia gpu going to degrade it?
<dexter>	tylerdurden01: nvidia is going to eat your battery
<dexter>	my t530 gets 4.5 hours with the nvidia gpu on. if i turn it off, i get 9+.
<tylerdurden01>	dexter: but my laptop's almost always plugged in
<jackdaniel>	tylerdurden01: i'd use intel anyway, and when you have somewhat heavy application, then dri_prime=1 appname
<dexter>	tylerdurden01: then you're fine
<dexter>	if it overheats using the nvidia gpu you bought crap anyway :3
<tylerdurden01>	jackdaniel: but the performance is really, really underperforming with the switching thingy :(
<tylerdurden01>	dexter: my laptop's kinda cheap :d
<dexter>	tylerdurden01: what is it?
<jackdaniel>	maybe i just don't have that high requirements
<dexter>	worst case scenario you buy a laptop cooler and put it under it.
<dexter>	if it still overheats hit it with a sledgehammer.
<tylerdurden01>	dexter: asus x552m. the nvidia gpu is 820m.
<jeancarlomachado>	any ideias why i cannot connect to mysql using 127.0.0.1 but localhost works?
<dexter>	dunno. all you can do is try it and monitor temps.
<hyo0301>	´´´´´th´´´´his is a meme ´´´´
<wasamasa>	!slap hyo0301
<phrik>	hyo0301: i shall slap you with my stuffed tux!
<dagle>	krumelmonster: ...
<tylerdurden01>	meh, i'll give it nvidia-only a shot
<hyo0301>	wasamasa: love you too
<krumelmonster>	dagle: would it break a rule to make one d-programming-deimos package that contains all the bindings and maybe put all the individual bindings in the provides array. i see no reason not to install all of them at once (just a few headers each) and it would be pain in the butt to manually install each of them (and review all the pretty much identical pkgbuilds).
<tylerdurden01>	ok, running only the nvidia gpu, but xgamma and xbacklight don't work anymore
<tylerdurden01>	and neither can i run a game through wine
<hendry>	anyone here managed to use vnc or some other remote desktop from the archlinux machine to a macosx yosemite machine?
<tazmain>	hi all, where can i find the pptp logs ? or would that fall under networkmanager ?
<pid1>	i've only used chrome remote desktop, but that worked fine.
<tylerdurden01>	hmm. i also have screen tearing while using only the nvidia gpu.
<earnestly>	so enable vsync
<earnestly>	without compositing you won't ever get rid of them either
<earnestly>	welcome to xorg
<earnestly>	no, the preset extension doesn't help
<earnestly>	present*
<earnestly>	dagle: i liked this: http://sprunge.us/oqgc?make
<jackdaniel>	hmm, any decent static tiling wm on wayland? ,þ
<earnestly>	jackdaniel: orbment
<earnestly>	or velox
<jackdaniel>	earnestly: thanks
<earnestly>	jackdaniel: orbment will be cooler :p
<earnestly>	mostly because it can support 9p vfs configuration
<earnestly>	cp /orbment/screenshot.png foo.png
<jackdaniel>	but both are static? i hate dynamic tile changes
<earnestly>	jackdaniel: i don't know what you mean by static
<jackdaniel>	hm, awesome rearranges your tiles to fit your applications for instance
<wasamasa>	earnestly: the vfs support is already there?
<earnestly>	awesome is a dynamic tiling wm
<earnestly>	wasamasa: yeah, just not in master
<wasamasa>	earnestly: hmk
<jackdaniel>	but notion allows you to put on same frame a few windows creating tabs
<earnestly>	wasamasa:     mount -t 9p $xdg_runtime_dir/orbment.9p orbment -o trans=unix,debug=0xffff,user=$user,dfltuid=$uid,dfltgid=$gid
<jackdaniel>	and doesn't rearrange your layout
<th0rne>	what's a good fps with ctf or something that you can play on lan using a year-old mid/high-end laptop?
<earnestly>	jackdaniel: so a manual tiling window manager
<earnestly>	jackdaniel: there are none like that for wayland yet, but you can use wlc and write your own
<jackdaniel>	yeah, that might be less misleading word
<earnestly>	jackdaniel: wlc is a bit like the xcb for writing wayland compositors
<wasamasa>	earnestly: i don't think i really need scripting as long as i can set tabs/monocle as default view, change keybinds and switch to another automatic layout if i ever have the need to display one window next to each other
<wasamasa>	earnestly: basically, what i'm making use of in i3
<jackdaniel>	i'll give it a shot in a free time, thanks
<earnestly>	wasamasa: if you want tabs you'd have to write a plugin for orbment i guess.  it does the rest
<earnestly>	wasamasa: really nice plugin system, orbment itself is a plugin ;p
<lemonxah>	cannot open tun/tap
<lemonxah>	hmm
<wasamasa>	earnestly: i noticed when flicking through the sources lately
<tazmain>	guys i have googled for this. but there is no /var/log/syslog file. how do i get the log of networkmanager or debug it so that i can see what is going wrong with my pptp vpn connection ?
<namarrgon>	tazmain: journalctl
<pid1>	journalctl
<lemonxah>	guys how do i get tun/tap on arch
<lemonxah>	wanna setup openvpn client
<tazmain>	ah i see thanks namarrgon pid1
<shapeshifter>	wasamasa: last i checked, systemd-networkd was still a buggy mess
<tylerdurden01>	darn it, couldn't run a game in wine because i didn't have lib32-nvidia-libgl installed.
<lemonxah>	any help with openvpn?
<tylerdurden01>	anyway, why won't xgamma and xbacklight work now that i have the intel gpu disabled?
<pid1>	!give lemonxah wiki openvpn
<phrik>	lemonxah: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/openvpn
<lemonxah>	the docs say i should make universal tun?tap m
<tylerdurden01>	does nvidia have a separate tool or something?
<lemonxah>	pid1, yes but that doesn't work
<lemonxah>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/openvpn#configure_the_system_for_tun.2ftap_support
<phrik>	title: openvpn - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<lemonxah>	zgrep config_tun /proc/config.gz
<lemonxah>	config_tun=m
<lemonxah>	that is what it has to be
<tazmain>	i wish the wiki explain pptp better, its all commandline and that fails as well.
<earnestly>	wasamasa: https://github.com/cloudef/orbment/commit/2515f6028beb
<phrik>	title: vfs · cloudef/orbment@2515f60 · github (at github.com)
<earnestly>	lemonxah: man, if you read the shell script in zgrep, you wouldn't use it
<lemonxah>	i was using the code that is on the arch iwki
<lemonxah>	wiki even
<tylerdurden01>	hmm. running only the nvidia gpu doesn't give much more performance than running it with bumblebee.
<wasamasa>	earnestly: btw, is there anything for displaying a statusbar yet?
<earnestly>	lemonxah: come come, how is that relevant?  "i was just following orders, sir"
<earnestly>	wasamasa: nope
<earnestly>	wasamasa: basically contributors welcomed :p
<lemonxah>	earnestly, its relevant when you are learing
<lemonxah>	learning even
<lemonxah>	i have /dev/net/tun :/
<lemonxah>	maybe i need to reboot
<lemonxah>	brb
<holomorph>	if only i knew how :(
<wasamasa>	earnestly: now, if only i were a c hacker instead of lisper
<jusic>	do i have to register seperate for the forum and the wiki?
<earnestly>	lemonxah: i don't really buy into the "shh, shh, it's magic just do it like we tell you" method of teaching though.
<pid1>	justin8, yes.
<pid1>	sorry, justic yes.
<jusic>	thx
<earnestly>	wasamasa: you could write bindings to it, probably.  besides, "you are not your programming language of choice".  i wish you'd drop that attitude, it's really annoying
<wasamasa>	earnestly: you wish me to write lisp in c?
<jackdaniel>	wasamasa: it's not a problem, use ecl
<jackdaniel>	(shameless plug) ,þ
<wasamasa>	jackdaniel: nevar
<dagle>	earnestly: now he just need plan b support!!
<earnestly>	it's amazing how you can't even think of an alternative.  it's like religious people who think atheists must believe in some scientist as their god because they just can't see it.
<jackdaniel>	wasamasa: why?
<wasamasa>	jackdaniel: also, that wouldn't help me here
<wasamasa>	jackdaniel: the point is that my c skills are on "can pass a college course" level
<earnestly>	"i identify as xyz, it's vaguely defined so i can use it as an execuse"
<thelemon1an>	what are you fighting over this time ?
<jackdaniel>	well, you can call c functions from ecl w/o a hussle, it's same calling convention
<tazmain>	no man i follow the arch wiki pptp nd now its even worse. the modem just hangs up on me
<jackdaniel>	you can even put ecl function as callback for c function
<earnestly>	"i suck as socialising because i haven't practice it, but i can excuse myself because i have "aspergers"".  fuck this.
<jackdaniel>	thats where e comes in ecl - embeddable (in c)
<earnestly>	"i suck at c because i'm a "lisper" (or "pythonista" or "rubyist" or "go fuck yourself")
<tylerdurden01>	is there any advantage to using nouveau over nvidia?
<jackdaniel>	well, im a lisper, but my hands are all covered with kernels blood ,þ
<jackdaniel>	tylerdurden01: better kernel support
<jackdaniel>	worse performance tough
<earnestly>	tylerdurden01: it uses the kernel's kms, that's about it
<tylerdurden01>	hmm. thought so.
<earnestly>	newer models are much worse in terms of performance due to a lack of proper reclocking.  you're also limited to mesa's gl version
<jackdaniel>	and you know, libre/free hype-attitude
<openess>	how do i control the leds on my keyboard. the internet tells me it might have something to do with /sys/class/leds/ but i can't figure it out. i want to turn my always-on wifi-indicator into something usefull or at least an always-off light.
<earnestly>	for newer cards nvidia will perform roughly 5x better than nouveau
<jackdaniel>	btw, older cards work better with nouveau then nvidia new blobs
<demonicmaniac3>	define newer
<demonicmaniac3>	660 ain/t that old
<earnestly>	i have an old card which runs just as well under nouveau, it has no dynamic clocks though
<demonicmaniac3>	and works very well with nouveau
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: yeah, that's old
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: by newer i mean 7xx and up
<earnestly>	the 660 also doesn't have any clock levels iirc
<demonicmaniac3>	o.o
<earnestly>	which is the major reason why nouveau falls so far behind
<demonicmaniac3>	ofc it does
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: one of them doesn't
<jusic>	is archlinux.de offical or a unoffical community translation?
<earnestly>	jusic: the wiki itself is not official
<earnestly>	jusic: only a few pages are like the installation guide
<demonicmaniac3>	if the 660 gtx didn't clock down you'd not get 10w idle and 200w load but 100w idle and 200w load
<jusic>	so if i'm good in english i should better go with the .org wiki?
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: i need to get a the 750ti, now that you remind me, just because the power is so much lower than the 9600
<jackdaniel>	if it's in .org, then you're fine, just use org-mode ;d
<demonicmaniac3>	660 is kepler as well so i don't see how the 700 kepler would be much worse, possibly the maxwell new models
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: yeah, those
<demonicmaniac3>	9600gt also doesn't use massively more than 750 ti under load
<demonicmaniac3>	idle is a bigger difference
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: yup
<demonicmaniac3>	but then only amd does zerocore disabling entirely when monitor switches off after 5 minutes idle :p
<jackdaniel>	gfx cards are a mess imho
<jackdaniel>	in comparison to basically anything else
<demonicmaniac3>	earnestly: you should wait for a 950
<demonicmaniac3>	due soon
<earnestly>	jackdaniel: no, everything is a mess :p
<wasamasa>	jusic: the english wiki is more comprehensive
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: for an old core2duo?  heh
<jackdaniel>	well, can't argue with that ^_^
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: i'm just waiting for the 750ti to be bargin bin stuff
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: i can barely justify even doing that.  just so ppsspp/dolphin runs a bit better
<demonicmaniac3>	earnestly: hvec dcoding
<demonicmaniac3>	and such
<demonicmaniac3>	*hevc
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: how does hevc make a difference?
<demonicmaniac3>	earnestly: 960 has hw decoding for hevc
<demonicmaniac3>	750 doesn't
<earnestly>	so?
<demonicmaniac3>	so you can't watch x265 on the 750 ti on the c2d
<earnestly>	so?
<kevr>	so that's the difference
<earnestly>	the machine doesn't have any videos on it
<earnestly>	kevr: i'm trying to understand the relevance
<demonicmaniac3>	and you can't if you ever update the machine to a new cpu, carrying the still not hevc capable 750 ti over if you ever upgrade
<kevr>	i know, just poking.
<earnestly>	so i send massively more so i can watch x265 videos?
<tylerdurden01>	speaking of hardware decoding, can i watch videos using vdpau with bumblebee?
<earnestly>	send/spend
<demonicmaniac3>	earnestly: i was saying if a 950 comes out
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: i can't upgrade the cpu without upgrading the mainboard
<demonicmaniac3>	960 is certainly too expensive
<earnestly>	a 950 will also be unjustifable
<kevr>	shiet, i still use a 560 gtx brah
<earnestly>	kevr: that's also fine
<kevr>	works great since i don't game and stuff
<demonicmaniac3>	so then you mean to buy a 750 ti used from private auction for half the price and possibly broken in a month? xd
<earnestly>	kevr: it'd work great even if you did
<demonicmaniac3>	because gpus never really get that cheap
<demonicmaniac3>	not the low end stuff
<kevr>	true that. when i still play cs:go sometimes, it runs great.
<demonicmaniac3>	only the high end does drop in price before it disappears, but even then not massively
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: i've seen the 750 ti go from £150 to £70
<earnestly>	new
<earnestly>	(and i can't even justify that because i just don't need it ;/)
<demonicmaniac3>	earnestly: o.o
<demonicmaniac3>	it's been 120 euro here for the last 18 months
<demonicmaniac3>	those 70 was some kind of special super auction by a single store then probably...
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: skinflint has had some that low, it usually hovers around 100
<demonicmaniac3>	for a week or so
<earnestly>	probably
<demonicmaniac3>	https://geizhals.at/?phistgfx=1089812&loc=de&age=9999&width=640&l=de&dc=eur
<demonicmaniac3>	that's the prices since first listing here - actually gotten more expensive heh
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: but yeah, even if it has hevc (which i really don't care about because i have principles against mpegla), i can't justify it.  everything sort of works okay as it is
<jushur>	hevc only works with nvidia binary right?
<lemonxah>	hi
<lemonxah>	so my tunnel is working now
<lemonxah>	just want to know how to setup a visual way of enabling this openvpn tunnel in gnome3
<kevr>	nice.
<wasamasa>	earnestly: my point was that i don't feel inclined in learning enough c to contribute to real-world projects
<demonicmaniac3>	jushur: if you mean hevc decoding then yes - the hw decoder/vdpau is only availabe on the 960 and only with the blob
<earnestly>	wasamasa: then say that
<kevr>	earnestly: i'm surprised you think that way.
<earnestly>	kevr: think what way?
<kevr>	it's delightful.
<kevr>	your thoughts on the language ordeal.
<earnestly>	wasamasa: i mean, what you said now is the truth.  stick with the truth, there's no shame in it :p
<earnestly>	kevr: i have no allegence to any language, they all have their advantages and disadvantages.  the implementation is more important
<kevr>	i can tell.
<earnestly>	allegiance*
<demonicmaniac3>	qi m series recording has begun
<earnestly>	kevr: idk, where the "rubber hits the tarmac" is what matters in the end
<kevr>	ditto
<earnestly>	kevr: any language can express (cf. expression problem) anything they want, but if it's not effecient or machine unfriendly, then it is useless
<demonicmaniac3>	earnestly: if it doesn't have an actual spec it's also useless and shit
<kevr>	earnestly: three members on my team of five in my web development practicum class this semester were constantly asking me "so, should we use ruby?" -- "php?" before we even got the project proposals
<krumelmonster>	does this look ok: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/d-programming-deimos-glfw-git/
<phrik>	title: aur (en) - d-programming-deimos-glfw-git (at aur.archlinux.org)
<kevr>	it was driving me fucking insane.
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: eh, i'm sort of agree with that.  but there are exceptions like k which doesn't have a spec
<earnestly>	and is very effeciently implemented
<earnestly>	krumelmonster: just no
<earnestly>	krumelmonster: tell me where you got the idea to do all the git juggling in build
<demonicmaniac3>	how can you implement anything without a spec? test harness to behave according to spec?
<wasamasa>	krumelmonster: don't reinvent git fetching please
<demonicmaniac3>	so you could build other implementations or know what to expect where
<earnestly>	krumelmonster: do you have a very old set of proto files?
<earnestly>	krumelmonster: or is it somewhere in the wiki?
<demonicmaniac3>	i feel like python especially oftentimes goes a random route
<kevr>	demonicmaniac3: seen it done plenty of times. though, it's generally a lot messier and sometimes pointless workarounds to more direct solutions that would be apparent with a spec
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: the author can implement the reference, without a spec.  i'm just saying that a spec doesn't make it useless
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: i'd prefer we had one compiler per language and avoid the quagmire that is c and c++
<kevr>	lol
<krumelmonster>	umm it's similar to https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/derelict3-sdl2-git/
<phrik>	title: aur (en) - derelict3-sdl2-git (at aur.archlinux.org)
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: specs are very nice to have though, i don't disagree
<krumelmonster>	i'll go read the vcs_package_guidelines more carefully.
<namarrgon>	that pkgbuild is indeed derelict
<earnestly>	krumelmonster: you sadly picked one of the worst pkgbuilds to reference :(
<demonicmaniac3>	earnestly: what i meant without spec is it grows without a clear clue cue python
<demonicmaniac3>	they just decide things on a whim
<demonicmaniac3>	and then they change it on a whim
<wasamasa>	demonicmaniac3: or ruby!
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: yeah, same with apis without protocols
<demonicmaniac3>	because there's no spec governing behaviour
<demonicmaniac3>	earnestly: yes or ruby
<demonicmaniac3>	er
<demonicmaniac3>	wasamasa: ^
<wasamasa>	demonicmaniac3: or <insert language devised by a single amateur>
<wasamasa>	funny how these got popular
<demonicmaniac3>	and ofc one compiler per language means you need to port that compiler to different architectures
<demonicmaniac3>	so you need at least some sort of spec governing behaviour in special cases on different machines
<demonicmaniac3>	and hire enough people to get your compiler ported to all architectures :p
<wasamasa>	"ruby won't have any breaking changes, 2.1 is stable enough!"
<wasamasa>	they fixed the language to no longer support the foo = foo idiom (when foo is both a variable and method)
<krumelmonster>	earnestly: the guidelines basically only tell me to put the url into sources. can you recommend a pkgbuild for reference on how to do the git fetching?
<wasamasa>	and that broke rails somewhere
<demonicmaniac3>	rails tends to break all the time anayways
<wasamasa>	it got fixed upstream, but i'm still on that rails version because bundler and team project, yay
<demonicmaniac3>	i remember for the longest time it needed 1.8
<earnestly>	krumelmonster: any of mine: https://github.com/earnestly/pkgbuilds are much better templates for pkgbuilds
<phrik>	title: earnestly/pkgbuilds · github (at github.com)
<tylerdurden01>	ok, so bbswitch's refusing to turn off the discrete gpu. what's wrong?
<earnestly>	krumelmonster: and if you're interested, here's how makepkg essentially works under the hood: (example at end) https://gist.github.com/earnestly/bebad057f40a662b5cc3
<phrik>	title: a brief overview of the process involved in creating a pacman package. (at gist.github.com)
<earnestly>	krumelmonster: pacman is honestly one of the most trivial package managers to create packages for, it's really pleasent compared with the others
<subarusvx>	installing de in arch do you do it?
<wasamasa>	pacman -s <name>

<wasamasa>	!give hyo0301 botabuse
<tazmain>	hi all, so i am trying to conenct to a pptp vpn ( it works in windows for me) using network manager. i saw this https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=186213, so i loaded the modules but still no go. should i try using the arch wiki guide to using the pptp-client? i did try but it still seems to fail.
<phrik>	hyo0301: please take that to either a query or #archlinux-botabuse.
<phrik>	title: [solved] networkmanager-pptp vpn not working after update to 0.9.10 / networking, server, and protection / arch linux forums (at bbs.archlinux.org)
<hyo0301>	?
<hyo0301>	really? for trying to find out what the commands are?
<earnestly>	amcrae: the format of what?
<earnestly>	amcrae: the package or the pkgbuild?
<amcrae>	pkgnuild
<wasamasa>	hyo0301: don't do it in the channel
<hyo0301>	then tell me
<joshsyn>	an opiniated question here. which tiling manager do you guys use?
<wasamasa>	...
<hyo0301>	instead of giving me abuse
<earnestly>	amcrae: that's fine.  here's my working idea: http://sprunge.us/atyy?make lol
<wasamasa>	!give hyo0301 version
<phrik>	hyo0301: the current (running) version of this supybot is 0.83.4.1+limnoria 2015.03.10, running on python 3.4.3 (default, mar 25 2015, 17:13:50)  [gcc 4.9.2 20150304 (prerelease)].  the newest versions available online are 2015.04.29 (in testing), 2015.04.29 (in master).
<amcrae>	rejected :p
<earnestly>	hehe
<earnestly>	amcrae: i don't mind the format honestly
<black_prince>	long live teh shell
<earnestly>	amcrae: makepkg itself is a bit extreme for something this simple though
<joshsyn>	last time i use linux i worked heavily with i3 window manager before switching to windows again. and again back on to linux, i started with gnome 3.16
<hyo0301>	zzzz
<tylerdurden01>	nevermind, fixed the problem myself.
<kevr>	amcrae: i like pkgbuilds
<godginrai>	ooh, amcrae's here
<hyo0301>	worst op
<wasamasa>	!abuse
<phrik>	0 days since last act of op rage
<joshsyn>	however, i find myself to arrange windows properly. i have heard bspwnrc to be quite nice?
<halfwit>	what a thankless tool.
<amcrae>	earnestly: probably is - but i like it being in bash whenever there is something hard to do
<kevr>	joshsyn: there are many window managers, and in that set of managers there are many in the subset of tiling window managers, you could try all of them out and see what you like
<joshsyn>	kevr, i know that. i want just wondering whats the major player out there folks are using
<wasamasa>	joshsyn: establishing useful statistics is hard
<godginrai>	joshsyn: wouldn't bspwmrc be a settings file for bspwm, rather than a wm?
<joshsyn>	godginrai, yeah true my bad
<joshsyn>	last time i had it in arch, it was only available through git. now its gone into the official repo
<kevr>	i dunno, i've been using xmonad for at least a year now, and i still love it
<wasamasa>	joshsyn: especially by asking a channel full of opinionated elitists
<hyo0301>	zzz
<amcrae>	who are all wrong
<kevr>	but there are lots of other ones. i3 is still definitely relevant, there's like awesomewm and stuff
<wasamasa>	joshsyn: i'd try looking at the galleries instead
<kevr>	a lot of them are good
<wasamasa>	!give joshsyn tias
<phrik>	joshsyn: try it and see™
<amcrae>	xfwm4
<godginrai>	wasamasa: but at least he learns about different options because we all have different biases :p
<joshsyn>	godginrai, exactly that
<joshsyn>	in your world, it would be like try all the medicine you want, and check which one works
<joshsyn>	lol
<tazmain>	this frikken pptp doesn't work
<braindamage>	try _all_ the programs!
<wasamasa>	godginrai: s/different options/a meaningless snapshot of an irc channel/
<hyo0301>	wiki/docs os is so cool
<godginrai>	wasamasa: it may be meaningless for you, but to others, it may be useful
<joshsyn>	use something like a search engine in the irc database backend to get rid of unwanted stuff
<wasamasa>	just look at what people currently use for that
<joshsyn>	i don't see anything wrong in asking these sort of stuffs other than to keep channel "clean"
<amcrae>	no point asking - everyone's opinion is wrong
<wasamasa>	if you can only find out little about it, it's usually for a reason
<kevr>	i feel like this exploded into a pointless argument
<joshsyn>	amcrae, greatest answer
<joshsyn>	ok i am gonna stop.
<thelemon1an>	the right answer is "it depends"
<earnestly>	amcrae: paradox!
<amcrae>	my opinion is excluded from that statement
<kevr>	lol
<godginrai>	amcrae: that's your opinion. *badum* *tish*
<joshsyn>	bspwm looks like the new playa in town
<wasamasa>	yeah and i have no clue why
<krumelmonster>	earnestly: is this better: http://pastie.org/private/nbt6djznlhnauusgztr80q should i increment pkgrel?
<phrik>	title: private paste - pastie (at pastie.org)
<joshsyn>	*badum* *tish*
<earnestly>	krumelmonster: you don't need useless variables like _gitname
<wasamasa>	the tiling abilities read like dwm
<earnestly>	krumelmonster: each function in the pkgbuild starts in $srcdir
<krumelmonster>	its not useless, it saves work when creating all the other packages for deimos
<tiktalik>	can i downgrade a package with arch linux?
<earnestly>	krumelmonster: use a template then
<thelemon1an>	some time ago (~2010 iirc) we got a enormous quantity of window managers, i'm still trying to figure out the reasons behind that wave
<kevr>	usually, the hottest wms out there are only the hottest because of social trends, not because of absolute truths. like someone else said, opinions differ, and what one person likes is not necessarily what you will like
<jackdaniel>	well, people look for alternatives from bloated ones (most popular are gnome/kde, which are relly good, yet heavy)
<kevr>	take that one guys advice and go look at some galleries, try some of the ones that stand out to you, see if you like them
<tiktalik>	thelemon1an: it doesn't matter- we herded them all onto a boat, and made them fight
<earnestly>	krumelmonster: see makepkg-template(1)
<tiktalik>	until the victors- i3, xmonad, and openbox came out
<earnestly>	krumelmonster: or use a split package
<new_one>	i recall there were many *box wm
<thelemon1an>	maybe the "binary space partitioning" idea sounds a lot cool to the average ricer nowadays
<earnestly>	krumelmonster: honestly, i'd just package them all in one.  just call it deimos-libs or so
<tylerdurden01>	before dwm, the one that i'm currently using, i used awesome, but i remember that a major upgrade screwed it up and hated it
<krumelmonster>	haha, i asked just that like an hour ago here and only got a reply about bread or something
<earnestly>	krumelmonster: either that or 'glfw-deimos-libs' perhaps.  since it's clearer that way
<earnestly>	krumelmonster: you got a logicians answer :p
<wasamasa>	thelemon1an: people manage making it look nice
<krumelmonster>	what's a split package?
<thelemon1an>	wasamasa, the only nice part of bspwm setups is the bar :p to be honest that's all you can see in the screencaps
<joshsyn>	any body know if i3 has gone major changes within the last year?
<earnestly>	krumelmonster: man pkgbuild
<wasamasa>	joshsyn: it changed the border color of my scratchpad!
<namarrgon>	it was rewritten in lisp and is now configured via c#
<earnestly>	krumelmonster: btw, you wrote the license as 'glfw', you need to include it in that case
<wasamasa>	joshsyn: still no clue what exactly triggered that change, i guess i'll live with it
<tylerdurden01>	what a surprise; it's a tiling window manager!
<teraflop>	hmmm, apart the up/down bars i do not see what can you setup to look nice in a tiling wm
<krumelmonster>	earnestly: even if it depends on glfw?
<wasamasa>	teraflop: colors, gaps, show off some silly programs you'd never make use of...
<krumelmonster>	(which provides the glfw license)
<kevr>	dont forget to use compton and make shit transparent so it looks even cooler
<tylerdurden01>	but will compton make it wobble?
<thelemon1an>	and don't forget the tiny unreadable fonts
<kevr>	tylerdurden01: no, but it'll remind you of compton
<kevr>	then you'll put on some dr. dre and stuff
<teraflop>	well, ill switch to loliwm/orbment, i'm just delaying in xmonad because i'm a romantic
<kevr>	ive never had a reason to stop using xmonad, so until i do, i'll use et
<teraflop>	kevr: wayland
<kevr>	?
<kevr>	for sure. i still use xorg.
<kyusaki>	good afternoon folks
<convict>	anyone else have issues with syanptic touchpad working in gdm but not gnome?
<aeronotix>	asd
<aeronotix>	i have a usb ethernet adapter that i can list using `ifconfig -a`
<teraflop>	convict: did you disable to touchpad in the gnome-setting by any chance and now the switch to enable it does not appear?
<teraflop>	s/to/the
<aeronotix>	i made a netctl entry containing the interface=$interface_name
<aeronotix>	but when i run it, i get: `profile $name does not especify a valid connection`
<convict>	teraflop, nope, it's a brand new installation. it's on a surface pro 3 using the linux-surfacepro3 package in the aur with the 4.0 kernel and some patches.
<teraflop>	convict: heh no clue then
<convict>	it's strange that it works fine in gdm. everything else works perfectly as well
<teraflop>	convict: you do gnome-wayland session or just genome?
<convict>	how can i tell if it's using wayland? i've never used wayland before personally
<teraflop>	convict: i mean in gdm you choose what gnome session you start
<teraflop>	and since gdm is doing wayland by default and the touchpad works there ...
<convict>	oh okay, give me a few minutes. aura is trying to build chromium-dev
<nostrora>	hello, can you advise me a good password manager ?
<tazmain>	guys how do i forward traffic from one adapater to another so that i can sort of use my machine as a bride? i can't find /etc/sysctl.conf
<convict>	nostrora, are you looking for more security or more ease of use?
<dagle>	nostrora: what's your requirements?
<thelemonman>	tazmain, first of all you need a priest
<nostrora>	convict: i'm looking for gui interface where i can see all of my password. a password generator (with pattern). password are saved in file (with good encryption)
<dagle>	nostrora: do you need support for multiple oses, secret service support?
<teraflop>	s/bride/bridge
<bakednotfried>	nostrora keepassx is good
<nostrora>	dagle: i want software are free and open source and support linux + android. what is secret service support ?
<dagle>	nostrora: secret service is a dbus interface that allows programs like firefox or chromium to ask for a password.
<aeronotix>	nostrora: keepassx
<braindamage>	nostrora: with the generation exception, pass and it's interfaces do that
<nostrora>	keepass seem more maintened than keepassx
<th0rne>	anyone use zeal docs? mine stopped working, cannot maximize it. reinstalling and removing config seem not to have helped.
<th0rne>	right clicking the tray icon only gives the "quit" option.
<nostrora>	thanks for keepassx is very very good for me ! :)
<nostrora>	now can you advise me a terminal emulator ? what do you think about 'terminator' ?
<kevr>	hasta la vista, baby.
<th0rne>	i use urvxt, i think it's good.
<steelcowboy>	i actually use xfce terminal and quite like it! really right on resources too
<doge__>	does anyone know why i get "fontconfig warning: fcpattern object size does not accept value 11(i)" when i run apps?
<d_garbage>	not personally, but google can be surprisingly helpful just by throwing error lines in it
<teraflop>	julius: oh boy gotham latest chapter is simply ... epic
<teraflop>	damn, sorry not here
<d_garbage>	a few tricks like adding (arch)linux to the search, limiting the time period and gradually trimming out the more specific details can help
<d_garbage>	another useful trick is google site search of the forums: site:bbs.archlinux.org <search>
<convict>	teraflop, it is wayland, saw it in ps aux. chromium-dev is taking years to compile on my laptop :p
<convict>	i'll try seeing if x11 works any better once it finishes
<teraflop>	convict: oh, good luck
<d_garbage>	pgrep > ps aux | grep
<d_garbage>	lol that's not some insane bash line. pgrep 'is better than' :p
<kupi>	hi
<d_garbage>	'ello
<kupi>	anyone uses wayland as primary display server here?
<d_garbage>	kupi, why?
<convict>	kupi, me apparently :p
<kupi>	nice, just wanted to ask if that is enough stable
<d_garbage>	only you can say
<d_garbage>	one person's 'stable' is another's
<d_garbage>	wtf? :)
<d_garbage>	kupi, wayland using what by the way?
<kupi>	i will try with velox and orbital
<d_garbage>	i mean 'wayland' isn't anything on it's own, right?
<teraflop>	convict: hmmm, are you sure it is gnome-wayland session or just gdm-wayland-session?
<d_garbage>	oh, never heard of either of them
<kupi>	s/orbital/orbment
<d_garbage>	ah orbment is the new loliwm
<teraflop>	d_garbage: yep
<d_garbage>	kupi, the guy who wrote that hangs out here
<d_garbage>	is it cloudef ?
<d_garbage>	i forget
<kupi>	nice :d
<convict>	teraflop, gdm-wayland-session
<teraflop>	convict: better pick gnome-wayland from the gdm greeter next time, to be sure
<d_garbage>	yeah, it is cloudef
<d_garbage>	earnestly, has a pkgbuild of it too iirc
<d_garbage>	so it's a kind of family affair :)
<d_garbage>	as a kde user, i'm excited that kwin/wayland is apparently coming along nicely
<d_garbage>	i feel awkward when i find i'm talking more than anyone else (which i can do a lot if i'm not careful) but i guess it's sometimes better than nothing? :p
<d_garbage>	not having sleep for a day doesn't help one's sense of judgement, i find :p
<dagle>	d_garbage: i bet rabbitear could teach you.
<d_garbage>	i rarely feel genuinely insulted, but you almost manage it with that statement
<kupi>	d_garbage, this seems to be a pretty quiet channel so that's a positive thing :d
<dagle>	dear diary, jackpot
<d_garbage>	dear diary, another day, another troll
<d_garbage>	!shrug
<phrik>	¯\(º_o)/¯
<dagle>	d_garbage: it was a family guy ref! don't slaughter it!
<d_garbage>	kupi, nah it's not quiet mostly, just occasionally. it is also the time of year. also sometime quiet is a relief :p
<dagle>	https://youtu.be/tyqpi2tnac0
<d_garbage>	ugh
<new_one>	all are quietly studying for finals
<kupi>	brb arching
<d_garbage>	one of the scariest things about irony is when you suspect people don't get it
<drewsrem>	are there genuine replacements for rsyslog when it comes to centralized logging one should be aware of?
<reisio>	does there need to be?
<d_garbage>	drewsrem, "centralized logging" as opposed to the system journal?
<drewsrem>	reisio, is what i'm trying to find out more or less
<d_garbage>	well, i mean the journal?
<d_garbage>	is basically that?
<drewsrem>	d_garbage, isn't there journald-remote now?
<drewsrem>	so i guess journald doesn't just manage logs locally anymore
<d_garbage>	ah, remote, is that what the 'centralised' bit means?
<d_garbage>	like logs from different machines?
<drewsrem>	"centralized logging" as in "minions" send their logs to a "master" that keeps all the logs
<kjk>	centralization ... yeah -- *that's* the ticket!
<lemonxah>	you know .. i really love arch
<clarjon1>	how come?
<d_garbage>	drewsrem, maybe a bit over my head that. but on a single system i think that the journal basically does what the syslog used to
<lemonxah>	just cause it was super easy to setup
<d_garbage>	you can forward to it if needed from the journal i think (for stuff that expects syslog?)
<lemonxah>	setting up a openvpn client so that my work proxy doesn't catch my traffic was simple
<drewsrem>	d_garbage, right, you can tell journald to forward to syslog
<drewsrem>	d_garbage, and not store logs
<lemonxah>	over all its very easy to do exactly what i want without bulk
<d_garbage>	yeah. tbh that's about all i know about it. i'm no sys admin except in the strictest, most limited sense of running this home computer :)
<drewsrem>	d_garbage, right, i keep adding systems to manage so that i'm thinking about how to maintain them more comfortable then just sshing into each one of them
<d_garbage>	heh, well remote access and servers is definitely out of my limited scope but i often just get chatting to people about things to help generate interest from others that might know more :)
<reisio>	drewsrem: you can use it with systemd, aiui
<reisio>	moreover, you can... avoid systemd altogether :d
<kjk>	interesting

<lemonxah>	will never use another distro again ..
<kupi>	i'm pressing mod + enter but nothing happens in orbment
<lemonxah>	thnx to who/whom ever started this .. its best bro
<parkerr>	lemonxah: glad you like it. i sure have been
<d_garbage>	judd vinet
<drewsrem>	i'm making the consistent experience that whenever i mount an nfs share and it happens to go offline while mounted (e.g. the server shuts down) a lot of applications just start hanging when they're trying e.g. to ls the mountpoint or even just the directory thats above the mountpoint. - even tho i specified a timeo, happens to me with all 3: autofs, systemd-mounts and manual mounts.
<d_garbage>	!give lemonxah about
<phrik>	lemonxah: about arch linux: http://www.archlinux.org/about/ - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/arch_linux
<d_garbage>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/history_of_arch_linux
<phrik>	title: history of arch linux - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<nerfquark>	it's the functional package management + abs + aur that hooks you.
<kjk>	drewsrem: any samba involved?
<d_garbage>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/official_repositories#historical_background
<phrik>	title: official repositories - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<drewsrem>	kjk, no, these mounts are just nfs4 mounts
<drewsrem>	kjk, i'm somehow suspecting that connman is to blame, i should probably try the same with networkmanager
<drewsrem>	anyway, this has been my experience since basically forever
*	kjk remembers something like this with a shop that had all hp switches ... <mumble>
<d_garbage>	lemonxah, and held together by some rather talented and generous people such as amcrae
<drewsrem>	kjk, i'd be surprised if its my hw, but i might test for that when i'm more frustrated
<lemonxah>	yeah this is amaze
<d_garbage>	what's really amazing is how few people make it happen and how many people use it
<lemonxah>	i would love to contrib .. if i can / when i can i am not familiar enough with linux to do so yet
<kjk>	d_garbage: a sign that there is no beauracracy impeding things.
<d_garbage>	!give lemonxah contribute
<phrik>	lemonxah: http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/getting_involved
<d_garbage>	kjk, true, just generally users who perform that function :)
<kjk>	eek!  communists!
<d_garbage>	lemonxah, the simplest way to contribute is just be a happy user
<lemonxah>	heh
<lemonxah>	yeah
<lemonxah>	very happy
<lemonxah>	but my openvpn connecting gets stale
<lemonxah>	not arch issue
<lemonxah>	but still anoying
<d_garbage>	!shrug2
<phrik>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<drewsrem>	lemonxah, stale?
<lemonxah>	stops working without disconnecting
<kupi>	when i switch to terminal ctrl+alt+f1 while using orbment the system freezes
<kjk>	drewsrem: means "soggy and hard to light"
<lemonxah>	might be the network infrastructure that they have
<lemonxah>	reason i am using a vpn server is cause they are blocking everything on this network
<drewsrem>	lemonxah, i remember something experiencing something like that, never fixed it
<lemonxah>	and have proxy
<lemonxah>	its super anoying
<drewsrem>	kjk, ah... okay...
<lemonxah>	but they dont proxy on port 21 .. so
<lemonxah>	win
<kjk>	always happy to help with technical terms
<d_garbage>	what does 'technical' mean? :p
<kjk>	that's easy.  "technical" is a term that means "very few people will get the joke."
<d_garbage>	lol
<d_garbage>	i'm technically funny, then :)
<d_garbage>	!sting
<phrik>	ba-dum *ching*
<d_garbage>	also reminds me of terry pratchett's "what does 'quantum' mean?", "i think it means 'add another zero'" :)
<kjk>	heh.
<kjk>	so the banking systems are quantum structures, technically.

<convict>	chromium is never going to build lol
<d_garbage>	i bet the source is huge
<convict>	yeah and im compiling on a surface
<d_garbage>	build overnight :)
<d_garbage>	i keep my pc on all the time, i like to keep it working. when i go to bed i run folding@home :)
<d_garbage>	though i also switch the cores to powersaving, don't want to wear things out too much, heh
<convict>	d_garbage, i set it to but i guess my laptop suspended even though that option is off :/
<d_garbage>	oh dear
<d_garbage>	that needs investigating then
<vodik>	huh, i think i broke weechat smart filter somehow
<d_garbage>	how does this brokenness manifest itself?
<vodik>	stopped working
<d_garbage>	lol
<d_garbage>	what is a smart filter anyway? join/part type stuff?
<kjk>	thump it a good one.
<d_garbage>	turn it off and on again
<witquicked>	when i've got a drop-in override for a systemd unit file (e.g. /etc/systemd/system/updatedb.service.d/updated.conf) and i'm trying to override the execstart - shouldn't i only need to set execstart in that drop-in to make sure the original execstart isn't executed?
<witquicked>	the reason i'm asking is that i've set an execstart override for updatedb, but instead of the service just firing that override, it's firing both execstart's
<witquicked>	http://sprunge.us/riql
<witquicked>	the original "default" execstart is fired first, followed by the override
<witquicked>	oho
<witquicked>	thanks d_garbage
<witquicked>	actually
<witquicked>	it's off
<d_garbage>	?
<witquicked>	cuz it's a timer-driven service
<namarrgon>	you need to first set it to an empty execstart=, then the new one
<d_garbage>	witquicked, that's kind of spooky
<witquicked>	so two lines in my override?
<d_garbage>	witquicked, are you a mind reader?
<witquicked>	no... not a mind reader
<d_garbage>	witquicked, i was just about to say "is it a timer" but hadn't actually typed it yet
<witquicked>	;)
<teraflop>	what does mean the c compiler identification is unknown ?
<d_garbage>	that's freaked me out a wee bit
<witquicked>	heh
<rena>	hmm, seems like the "captcha" for bbs registration is sensitive to trailing spaces
<witquicked>	d_garbage, i'm harmless
<witquicked>	really
<d_garbage>	that kind of thing gets really weird when you've not slept for 24 hours :p

<witquicked>	nice, namarrgon that did the trick
<bobbertson>	during the halo online closed beta, we will continuously adjust and modify gameplay, features, and the in-game economy.

<teraflop>	tomty89: it's from aur/wlc-git do i better put a message in the pakgbuild site? i just want to be sure the error is not in my side
<earnestly>	teraflop: i r maintainer
<d_garbage>	is it supposed to build with clang?
<earnestly>	it shouldn't matter what the cc is
<teraflop>	earnestly: i just get http://ix.io/ipr

<earnestly>	teraflop: file /usr/bin/clang
<teraflop>	earnestly: http://ix.io/ips
<demize>	-fvar-tracking-assignments seems to be a gcc flag.
<tomty89>	*shrug* i can see that option documented in `man gcc` but not `man clang`
<demize>	tomty89: there are few things in the clang manpage.
<tomty89>	indeed
<earnestly>	demize: hm.
<demonicmaniac3>	earnestly: don't need a file
<vsilv>	hey folks, my laptop is always at about 100 degrees
<demize>	anyway, clang raises errors on unrecognized arguments.
<demonicmaniac3>	earnestly: his error clearly shows clang runs but fails on the flag
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: yeah, i didn't read it all
<earnestly>	demize: i believe there is a way to make clang ignore unknown options iirc
<demonicmaniac3>	i'd never even heard of that option
<demonicmaniac3>	the -fvar-tracking-assignments that is
<earnestly>	-wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future
<teraflop>	earnestly: is there a way to do some wrapper thing so i can use other compiler? excuse my ignorance im not used to do such things
<kupi>	i can't open velox, it says fatal could not open display
<wasamasa>	cc=clang
<wasamasa>	kupi: don't set display then?
<demize>	earnestly: that doesn't work
<demize>	also, unused != unknown, mmm
<earnestly>	demize: apparently not
<wasamasa>	kupi: i had that issue under orbment though
<kupi>	there is no other option
<earnestly>	cloudef: can you move var-tracking-assignments to the debug build?
<d_garbage>	vsilv, if you mean that literally then that's not great
<kupi>	orbment works for me but it has not many features
<earnestly>	teraflop: i really hate this deviation between gcc and clang.  those both try to supply the same options but neither seem to realise it's okay to skip gcc or clang options
<wims>	i got a game that is running full screen. however, when i the mouse to move the viewpoint and i move it far enough so that the pointer appears on my secondary monitor and i click the game does not register the click. how can i force the game to keep the mouse cursor inside it's workspace so to say? game is minecraft btw
<demize>	cloudef: or check if the compiler is gcc.
<d_garbage>	vsilv, check fans/ventilation high temps are going to wear out your hardware iirc
<teraflop>	well i ended doing git submodule thing from orbment github for having builtin wlc so i can live with that
<earnestly>	teraflop: you're not even going to make an issue on the project? :/
<teraflop>	 earnestly ok np
<teraflop>	earnestly: --> tomty89: it's from aur/wlc-git do i better put a message in the pakgbuild site? i just want to be sure the error is not in my side
<earnestly>	teraflop: it's pretty obviously not your problem
<tomty89>	teraflop: https://github.com/cloudef/wlc

<teraflop>	ok
<teraflop>	earnestly: heh ok it's pretyy obvious for you ^
<d_garbage>	how is clang different from (g)cc?
<earnestly>	d_garbage: that's a very extreme question

<naypalm>	i would do thatt

<kjk>	what sets debugging flags for that conf?
<teraflop>	ok np, i fill the issue and attach the cmakecache.txt
<tomty89>	naypalm: no need (completely) follow it. it's seems outdated
<naypalm>	bleh :(
<naypalm>	alright then tomty89 i'll bin this project for now
<kjk>	hm.  those are set in my conf.
<demize>	oh
<demize>	i know
<demize>	earnestly: the debug option
<tomty89>	naypalm: actually it seems wrong instead :p
<earnestly>	demize: uh?
<earnestly>	demize: oh, cmake is adding it?
<tomty89>	naypalm: and it's up to you
<naypalm>	the %i is for the username which should be in /run or whatever
<demize>	earnestly: no makepkg.
<naypalm>	i know nothing about dbus so the .service makes little sense to me
<demize>	earnestly: options=('debug' '!strip')
<tomty89>	naypalm: because it actually told you to user the dbus service/socket shipped with systemd as a user service/socket
<tomty89>	which i see no sense exist
<naypalm>	it doesn't exist
<demize>	earnestly: that argument is one of the default arch debug cflags.
<earnestly>	oooh, there it is
<earnestly>	demize: do you know how teraflop is managing to include them?
<naypalm>	i just need dbus running under my systemd --user so i can run xflux
<demize>	earnestly: options=('debug' '!strip')
<earnestly>	demize: or is it because
<earnestly>	yeah
<demize>	mmm...
<naypalm>	(as opposed to global dbus, i suppossse)
<tomty89>	naypalm: did you source /etc/x11/xinitrc.d/*.sh (hence 30-dbus.sh) in your xinitrc
<earnestly>	demize: this is probably a bug in clang
<earnestly>	demize: that is, it should accept gcc's arguments and no-op them
<naypalm>	i will have, tomty89
<earnestly>	and vis-versa
<demize>	earnestly: they have a white-list of "safe to ignore" args.
<earnestly>	demize: but makepkg shouldn't probably use it because it doesn't make sense on its own apparently
<earnestly>	well, not much
<naypalm>	(hence 30-dbus.sh)
<tomty89>	naypalm: "however, if you are going to use some program depending on d-bus as a systemd user service, you will also need to run the d-bus server as a systemd service to satisfy this dependency." i don't know if such program exists, but even if it does, i don't think the wiki is providing a right way
<naypalm>	i hos'n taze a 30-dbus
<demize>	"annotate assignments to user variables early in the compilation and attempt to carry the annotations over throughout the compilation all the way to the end, in an attempt to improve debug information while optimizing."
<teraflop>	cloudef: i just pray for empathy an comprenhension, im not used to file issues
<naypalm>	i agree teraflop
<naypalm>	tomty89 *
<naypalm>	sorry teraflop
<holomorph>	wut
<demize>	sounds useful for debug builds, though it depends on how much of a difference it makes.
<earnestly>	teraflop: cloudef is the best, don't worry :p
<teraflop>	thanks
<demize>	oh
<demize>	"it can be enabled even if var-tracking is disabled, in which case annotations are created and maintained, but discarded at the end. by default, this flag is enabled together with -fvar-tracking, except when selective scheduling is enabled. "
<demize>	that makes no sense then?
<earnestly>	that's my understanding
<demize>	amcrae: ping
<earnestly>	teraflop: remove -fvar-trac... debug_cflags="-g -fvar-tracking-assignments"
<naypalm>	> naypalm | i hos'n taze a 30-dbus
<teraflop>	earnestly: ok
<naypalm>	(massive typo, keys on wrong fingres)
<naypalm>	i actually do have a 30-dbus.sh
<tomty89>	you should, unless you deleted it :p
<naypalm>	i did not!
<earnestly>	teraflop: if you haven't already made an issue you probably don't have to now
<demize>	earnestly: i wonder how much of a difference it makes though. if it does make a difference than changing to -fvar-tracking would make sense, and just have to change the cflags if you don't want to use gcc.
<earnestly>	teraflop: basically if you want to use clang you'll also have to curate some of the other options.  arch linux's base-devel uses gcc and not clang, so makepkg assumes gcc flags
<earnestly>	demize: yeah
<teraflop>	earnestly: oh, i was filling the title right now, so theres no need to file the issue?
<naypalm>	where were you going with the 30-dbus.sh though tomty89?
<naypalm>	(too many /t.*/ nicks here
<teraflop>	earnestly: ok thanks for the explanation
<tomty89>	naypalm: where were i going with it? you mean like .xinitrc? http://ix.io/ipz
<demize>	https://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/commit/trunk/makepkg.conf?h=packages/pacman&id=a050c8a4e9bb27693dc848f923564223defbb76c hmm
<phrik>	title: svntogit/packages.git - git clone of the 'packages' repository (at projects.archlinux.org)
<tomty89>	what language is hos'n taze
<d_garbage>	the language of the future
<demize>	amcrae: -fvar-tracking-assignments seems to be literally useless without -fvar-tracking as it will just discard the annotations then, so should probably change -fvar-tracking-assignments to -fvar-tracking in the arch makepkg.conf if it makes any difference, or drop it otherwise.
<demize>	amcrae: (-fvar-tracking enables -fvar-tracking-assignments)
<d_garbage>	welcome to the world of tomorrow!
<tomty89>	d_garbage: like universe language?
<tomty89>	or multiverse

<teraflop>	thank you it builds right now
<d_garbage>	earnestly, ^ \o/

<lebenserfahrung1>	i know this is an archlinux irc; but still the geeks are here. so here's the question: i have cyanogen on nexus 6 verizon up and running but i am unable to browse the internet while calling in (was possible with the stock rom); any ideas?
<tomty89>	naypalm: not sure about the program you mentioned though
<reisio>	lebenserfahrung1: goof

<d_garbage>	not technically offtopic necessarily
<d_garbage>	!whatisontopic
<phrik>	the main topic of the channel is support for and discussion about arch linux. talk about general software and hardware is ok if it does not interfere with the main topic of the channel. anything else is handled on a case-by-case basis at the op's discretion. (source: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/irc_channel#.23archlinux_rules)
<dx>	demize: (it recently received a -2 update by someone who is not the maintainer, a dependency rebuild)
<dx>	tylerdurden01: thanks for the advice, brb buying a horse head
<tylerdurden01>	lebenserfahrung1: tried asking that in #android-root?
<lebenserfahrung1>	reisio: posted on some of them already; not helpful
<demize>	dx: i poked him on irc for you.
<lebenserfahrung1>	tylerdurden01: thanks; i'll asking there
<naypalm>	let's go no-systemd route then? or maybe /etc/systemd route? which do you think? (question incomming)
<naypalm>	i use xflux so my eyes don't explode at 10pm
<dx>	demize: ..oh i thought he wasn't online
<dx>	thanks
<naypalm>	i'd like it in a systemd user file
<naypalm>	ideally under ~/.systemd/user but that breaks because there's no user dbus
<earnestly>	why the fuck would you want to use home/.systemd?
<holomorph>	lol
<d_garbage>	uh-oh, is it kraken time?
<naypalm>	is this not
<naypalm>	like
<naypalm>	a good thing?
<dx>	"~/.config/systemd/user/"?
<naypalm>	yes ~/.config/systemd/user/
<holomorph>	naypalm: in general it's painful to do x things in user units
<tomty89>	naypalm: well i might try to create an 30-dbus.sh equivalent service if it's really necessary
<d_garbage>	naypalm, commas are a thing
<tomty89>	naypalm: instead of using the method in archwiki
<tomty89>	naypalm: unless someone show me solid proof that it's the right way
<dx>	naypalm: i just throw xflux in .xinitrc
<earnestly>	naypalm: here's a solution, don't.  just start it with your xinitrc or whatever you do as part of xserver startup.
<naypalm>	dx | naypalm: i just throw xflux in .xinitrc
<naypalm>	systemd for life
<dx>	lol
<tomty89>	naypalm: thing is, systemd doesn't suggest this way
<sheep>	systemd user sessions still aren't fully developed
<jackdaniel>	poor thing
<jackdaniel>	:d
<naypalm>	ok ok ok ok
<earnestly>	you're clearly out of your depth if you want to use systemd for xorg related units, my suggestion is to not.
<earnestly>	i've done it before, it's not worth it.
<tomty89>	naypalm: otherwise you can probably systemctl --user enable directly
<naypalm>	i've done it before too earnestly, it went badly
<naypalm>	but i figured it was my fault
<naypalm>	which it probably was
<earnestly>	yes, it will go badly.  wait until upstream givesa shit about --user units again
<naypalm>	o.k.
<dx>	i have a systemd user unit for synergys, but i'm not sure if it works or not, considering that i kill synergys all the time
<naypalm>	right .xinit it is
<earnestly>	they're waiting for kdbus before revisisting it.  they've added a tool to inject xorg display for the time being recently
<earnestly>	you can use systemd user units for non-xorg related things just fine
<dx>	not enough systemd
<earnestly>	although there's then the issue of dbus not knowing what it wants to do with user sessions
<earnestly>	i hope the comments on the lkml about the shitty state of dbus will wake a few of them up
<earnestly>	the idea that they want to develop an ipc based on unproven code is insane
<earnestly>	i didn't realise the dbus camp had literally no perf results or benchmarks
<earnestly>	that is, they had none to offer to the kernel developers as proof of design.  they just sort of thought it was needed to move into the kernel and when asked they produce some really crappy benchmark that doesn't even show performance gains, wonderful.
<meskarune>	so i cloned the arch linux website from https://projects.archlinux.org/archweb.git/ and was following the readme to set everything up. after i ran ./manage.py syncdb
<phrik>	title: archweb.git - arch website code (at projects.archlinux.org)
<meskarune>	the git repo ws reporting new files
<meskarune>	is that ok when i do a pr or should those be in the git ignnore?
<meskarune>	maybe i should just email dan ;)
<holomorph>	probably!
<naypalm>	ok i want your analysis https://bpaste.net/show/66d67f827549
<d_garbage>	lol "production installation" "ask someone who knows, or you are going to be in trouble."

<naypalm>	setxkbmap dvorak
<naypalm>	also ii'd like setxkbmap as a udev rule
<tomty89>	naypalm: why as a udev rule?
<wasamasa>	naypalm: that won't really work
<wasamasa>	naypalm: https://github.com/wasamasa/dotfiles/blob/master/etc/x11/xorg.conf.d/20-keyboards.conf
<phrik>	title: dotfiles/20-keyboards.conf at master · wasamasa/dotfiles · github (at github.com)
<wasamasa>	naypalm: this will!
<tomty89>	dynamic keymap with different keyboard? lol
<naypalm>	tomty89: because if you unplug, and plug in again
<naypalm>	it goes back to qwerty
<wasamasa>	tomty89: i put the compose key on different locations depending on the keyboard
<tomty89>	naypalm: ehh?
<naypalm>	i'll start at the beginning
<naypalm>	i have a keyboard
<naypalm>	it's plugged in via usb
<houn>	hrm
<naypalm>	if i unplug it
<naypalm>	and plug it in again
<naypalm>	it ignores xsetkbmap
<wasamasa>	*setxkbmap
<convict>	teraflop, so it was just gnome under the session. tried gnome-wayland and it works \(^_^)/
<tomty89>	naypalm: you use setxkbmap in .xinitrc?
<naypalm>	thanks wasamasa
<naypalm>	yeah
<tomty89>	naypalm: instead of an xorg conf?
<naypalm>	what if another user wants to log in?!
<wasamasa>	naypalm: my example is probably a bit too involved (since it's two keyboards and extra options), but you should be able to make use of it
<teraflop>	convict: it has its logic. glad to hear that
<tomty89>	naypalm: well you can have a user one i think
<convict>	teraflop, it breaks touchscreen though. i guess i can't have my cake and eat it too :(
<tomty89>	or actually no? :(
<teraflop>	convict: serface pro sounds tricky to me
<tomty89>	naypalm: oh it seems no, sorry
<convict>	teraflop, yeah, i know. i'm surprised it runs this well. arch runs better than windows 10 so far :p
<teraflop>	lol
<reisio>	lebenserfahrung1: not sure why you'd think a derivative of an "os" by google that is itself a copy of gnu/linux without the gnu would be helpful :d
<tomty89>	naypalm: you might make use of the xorgconfig env var though. man xorg.conf for details
<convict>	i mean, windows 10 is pretty nice but i get bluescreens and if the computer gets suspended you have to hard reboot it
<convict>	also gets really hot
<lebenserfahrung1>	reisio: when are you building up archlinux-arm for commercial devices :-)?
<naypalm>	tomty89 | naypalm: oh it seems no, sorry
<naypalm>	thanks anyway
<naypalm>	i'm setting it in the subdir of /etc/x11
<naypalm>	meh
<naypalm>	other users can suffer
<reisio>	lebenserfahrung1: tomorrow
<reisio>	i think intel might give arm a run for its money after all
<teraflop>	convict: that thing has an intel hd gpu. isnt it?
<reisio>	they certainly have the capacity to, and samsung builds whatever anyone pays for
<convict>	teraflop, yeah
<tomty89>	naypalm: what's does xflux do btw? change color temperature at night time?
<teraflop>	well that sounds good if you want wayland
<naypalm>	can i reeload xorg.conf without restart x?
<naypalm>	exactly teraflop
<naypalm>	tomty89
<naypalm>	*
<naypalm>	sorry again teraflop
<tomty89>	lol
<convict>	oh, touchscreen does work with wayland, just not chromium-dev apparently.
<teraflop>	np
<naypalm>	wait
<naypalm>	wait
<naypalm>	this reminds me of my original question
<tylerdurden01>	isn't it heat that makes laptop batteries faster? my battery's strangely cool after 2 hours of usage :o
<naypalm>	i asked
<d_garbage>	!give naypalm coffee
<phrik>	naypalm: way too much coffee, but if it weren't for the coffee, i'd have no identifiable personality whatsoever.
<naypalm>	"is there a way to highlight who last messaged with that name"
<tylerdurden01>	*that makes laptop batteries deteriorate
<naypalm>	is there a setting to tab complete the person that last *highlighted* you
<naypalm>	thanks godginrai, going to put on the coffee
<naypalm>	erm
<arch-tk>	polyzen: you run ptpb.pw right?
<naypalm>	d_
<naypalm>	d_garbage
<reisio>	naypalm: ask #weechat about last-spoke
<arch-tk>	polyzen: wait, nevermind
<arch-tk>	polyzen: buhman and some guy
<godginrai>	naypalm: lol i was wondering what i was being thanked for xd
<teraflop>	convict: why  do you need chromium-dev?
<naypalm>	option "*last-spoke*" not found (tip: you can use wildcard "*" in option to see a sublist)
<naypalm>	script?
<d_garbage>	is that the same as 'last spoke to me' though?
<convict>	teraflop, it has better hidpi support from what i read. i opened it and i every button was more than 1x1px
<naypalm>	i want dtab to highlightt d_garbage
<naypalm>	which it will atm
<naypalm>	but if demonicmaniac3 had spoken, not to me
<naypalm>	it would highlight him intsead
<naypalm>	and i'm slow as a slow thing so i wouldn't notice
<naypalm>	and be required to apologise
<naypalm>	you wouldn't get the notice
<naypalm>	basically worse than something really bad
<beest>	you can still apologize to the people you just pinged by saying their names
<polyzen>	arch-tk, jpettit was the original author, and he hosts ptpb.pw
<naypalm>	yes, and i do, beest !
<d_garbage>	you know, if you slow down a bit you could fit a whole sentence in one post?
<arch-tk>	polyzen: right
<polyzen>	afaik most of the contributions were done by buh
<beest>	or you can wave your arms and say their names three times and it will summon a poop demon
<d_garbage>	!kraken
<phrik>	release the kraken
<polyzen>	!grab beest
<phrik>	polyzen: tada!
<hexhaxtron>	anyone experienced problems with the keyboard especially in the terminal? characters become underlined, space doesn't work, sometimes one character becomes stuck and repeats itself... what should i do?
<d_garbage>	call an exorcist?
<reisio>	hexhaxtron: ctrl+c, 'reset'
<d_garbage>	!yt ghostbusters
<phrik>	d_garbage: ray parker, jr. - ghostbusters - youtube: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe93clbhjxq>
<beest>	that sounds very much like a hardware problem
<hexhaxtron>	reisio, no good...
<beest>	i don't think it's a locale issue
<johnfg>	i'm running arch in a vm, using xfce as my de.  no audio player at present.  what would you recommend?
<cloudef>	recommendation are hard, but i have feeling you would like deadbeef
<reisio>	johnfg: what're you used to?
<holomorph>	foobar in wine hehe
<reisio>	yeah, probably deadbeef like cloudef said
<reisio>	it's basically a foobar clone, iirc
<d_garbage>	mpv?
<reisio>	not like foobar at all, mpv
<d_garbage>	they didn't ask for such?
<reconmaster>	ran into some problems with nvidia-349 and gdm, had to roll back to 346 to get it to work
<reconmaster>	i am getting this weird message after rolling back from linux-4 to 3.19
<reconmaster>	nvidia: module license 'nvidia' taints kernel
<reconmaster>	is that normal?
<scimmia>	yes, that's normal
<scimmia>	reconmaster, intel processor?
<reconmaster>	yea
<scimmia>	reconmaster, haswell, i'm guessing? if so, update your microcode
<d_garbage>	!g kernel taint
<phrik>	d_garbage: linux: what is a tainted kernel? - unix & linux stack exchange: <http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/118116/linux-what-is-a-tainted-kernel>
<reconmaster>	ok, yeah i remember that. thanks d_garbage and scimmia
<reconmaster>
<reconmaster>	would that resolve the issues i am facing with the new nvidia module?
<reconmaster>	or do i just need to be patient on that front
<scimmia>	reconmaster, google tsx bug
<d_garbage>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/microcode
<phrik>	title: microcode - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<d_garbage>	should set it up in any case
<scimmia>	in short, yes, it will probably fix your nvidia/gdm problem
<d_garbage>	set and forget
<reconmaster>	alright, well thanks a lot guys. i'll probably have a much better weekend now
<d_garbage>	aww someone changed my comment on microcode :(
<maquis>	hi! for some reason, if i get out of x and try to drop to a virtual terminal on my new archlinux installation, my virtual terminal is unusable -- it is moving all over the screen, and i can't even read from it. i can't figure out how to make it stop doing that. my laptop has intel integrated video card.
<johnfg>	i see there are lots of deadbeef pkgs on aur.  is that the only way to install deadbeef?
<holomorph>	johnfg: it's in the repos dude
<maquis>	i'm not seeing anything useful in the xorg logs.
<d_garbage>	maquis, that's why you paste them so people can see if you missed anything :)
<d_garbage>	!pastebins
<phrik>	some good, sane pastebins are: <https://ptpb.pw/>, <https://bpaste.net/>, <https://gist.github.com/>, <http://sprunge.us/>, <https://ix.io/>, <http://pastie.org/> or <http://codepad.org/>.
<maquis>	d_garbage: will do. just give me a moment :) havent installed a browser on this machine yet. :)
<kupi>	anyone knows a command line music player what supports online radios? (m3u, pls files)
<d_garbage>	maquis, sprunge it
<maquis>	d_garbage: sprunge?
<d_garbage>	!sprunge
<phrik>	pipe or redirect your command or file into `curl -f 'sprunge=<-' sprunge.us`. this will upload to sprunge.us and return a link to the paste.

<d_garbage>	you?
<maquis>	d_garbage: sprunge.us/znpj
<scimmia>	!anyone
<phrik>	nope, just you
<d_garbage>	maquis, i didn't ask for it for myself, give it to the channel
<ipsilon>	scimmia: that is a better reply. that _i_ experienced it is implied in the question.
<maquis>	sprunge.us/znpj  <-- xorg logs for a virtual terminal that goes crazy after leaving x.
<d_garbage>	ipsilon, it's generally a useless question
<scimmia>	ipsilon, fwiw, i haven't seen any bug reports come through with a bunch of people having problems
<new_one>	what is purple and commutes?
<sheep>	new_one: idk
<ipsilon>	it is not a useless question. the question has issues, but it is not useless.
<scimmia>	ipsilon, is it segfaulting? if so, we go into the standard microcode questions
<d_garbage>	maquis, what's 1862.674 about? is that normal?
<ipsilon>	no scimmia, but i might have found a bug report that coincides with what i'm seeing.
<d_garbage>	ipsilon, does it not occur to you that there is an !anyone bang for a reason? :)
<ipsilon>	it says that it has to do with links..but i don't think it only crashed with links, so i'm still a bit curious.
<d_garbage>	ipsilon, ie because people ask 'has/does anyone' all the time and it almost never works as a question in inevitably needs details of the actual problem to be given
<d_garbage>	and*
<ipsilon>	i understand that well d_garbage, and that is why i only asked this when i saw that this cahnnel had very low activity.
<d_garbage>	?
<maquis>	d_garbage: i'm not certain. it's a new laptop, and i honestly was in the mac world for a few years, so i'm jumping back into linux after a while out. i can dig into why it's falling back on that, though.
<maquis>	i hadn't noticed that line :)
<sillysausage>	anyone here have a solarized theme for weechat?
<sillysausage>	i've looked about and haven't been able to find one
<aelius>	!sprunge
<phrik>	pipe or redirect your command or file into `curl -f 'sprunge=<-' sprunge.us`. this will upload to sprunge.us and return a link to the paste.
<d_garbage>	how does that make it any more likely to work? it's just a pretty fruitless way to frame a question at any time
<aelius>	what's that other text service i saw the other day?
<namarrgon>	maquis: intel gpu?
<namarrgon>	oh, nvm, missed the paste
<kjk>	has anyone noticed that i can't make sense out of questions that ask if anyone has had a particular problem?
<d_garbage>	aelius, possibly ix? or ptpb
<ipsilon>	d_garbage: similar quesitons have worked for me before. i was only curious..i wasn't seeking personal help on the matter.
<aelius>	d_garbage: yeah ix, what's the url?
<maquis>	namarrgon: yes
<d_garbage>	aelius, ix.io
<aelius>	thanks
<d_garbage>	yw
<ipsilon>	i don't believe there is anything _to_ learn. i understand the problems with the question...but i really don't think it is such a big deal. if it is a bothersome question to see, then i won't ask something like that in here again.
<sillysausage>	what was the question ipsilon?
<ipsilon>	haha sillysausage don't worry about it
<sillysausage>	now i just want to know even more
<d_garbage>	:)
<namarrgon>	i hate how flyspray keeps reverting to community
<namarrgon>	raid? some bugspray?
<grawity>	!grab d_garbage
<phrik>	grawity: tada!
<holomorph>	yes
<d_garbage>	yeah, american brand maybe
<arch-tk>	not american
<kjk>	yep.  raid has been around since before ddt was banned.
<arch-tk>	seen it in poland too
<arch-tk>	or well
<arch-tk>	not specific to america at least.
<kjk>	so international trade agreements actually do work.  interesting.
<sillysausage>	yeah now they would just sue governments
<sillysausage>	because it somehow effects their profits
<arch-tk>	what i need to figure out is how to get kodi (or my oc1) to redirect and stream the audio output across the network to my laptop so i can listen to the tv using headphones connected to my laptop instead of connecting them to a computer across the room.
<arch-tk>	well, how to do that without introducing a 2 week lag.
<d_garbage>	buy bluetooth headphones
<d_garbage>	!next
<phrik>	another satisfied customer! next!
<hyo0301>	relevant name
<fckr>	arch-tk: you could look into pulse audio rtp
<shardish>	arch-tk: my god, if you ever figure that out your next beer is on me. that would be awesome. my brief wrestle with pulse really didn't work.
<teraflop>	arch-tk: i wish it can be done using bt, but it is not possible on such things using kodi/xbmc
<arch-tk>	d_garbage: i don't feel like spending that sort of money on a transmitter and headphones which can receive it just to use them to, on certain occasions, listen to my tv
<d_garbage>	seriously, bt headphone are dirt cheap these days, reasonable quality
<namarrgon>	get a longer headphone-cable and plug them directly into the tv. quick, cheap, no lag, simple.
<d_garbage>	i had a pair for £20, lasted over 1 year of continuous usage
<arch-tk>	namarrgon: but then i need to switch between two outputs.
<arch-tk>	namarrgon: and that means i need to get up.
<d_garbage>	get an extension cable
<teraflop>	arch-tk: if you use kodi in not standalone mode sure you can use bt headset
<namarrgon>	i wasn't serious, i was just poking at the arch-way
<d_garbage>	run it under the carpet :p
<arch-tk>	d_garbage: no i have a sound bar and i want the option of listening using headphones, i would need to get up to switch between the two
<arch-tk>	also no carpet.
<shardish>	whats the maximum audio offset in kodi?
<namarrgon>	buy a carpet
<arch-tk>	lol
<arch-tk>	so now i need to buy a carpet too.
<d_garbage>	that rug really brought the room together
<d_garbage>	seriously, cheep bt headphones ftw
<teraflop>	d_garbage++
<bohverkill>	when will be gcc-multilib 5.1 out of testing?
<d_garbage>	mine only broke because i got a big head and the constant flexing of the headband broke the ribbon cable between the battery and the controller
<dagle>	arch-tk: say that you need hearing aid and you get hardware for free?
<d_garbage>	the battery was still getting 80% usage after 1 year of daily charging
<teraflop>	d_garbage: i bougth this one http://www.amazon.com/avantree-bluetooth-headphone-wireless-quality/dp/b00avzo9a6

<d_garbage>	damn stuff is so cheap in usa
<thrice>	bohverkill: why do you care?
<teraflop>	yeah
<d_garbage>	uk prices are just silly
<teraflop>	d_garbage: even worst in spain
<d_garbage>	ouch
<aelius>	the other year i was told i could have a capital letter in my username by manually editing it in, but lately pwck -r has been failing at boot because i have an invalid username. why are capital letters not allowed, and is there anything i can do to to get pwck to accept my username?
<d_garbage>	bohverkill, soon™
<kjk>	the us is expensive!  my gas went back up to over $2 / gallon
<bohverkill>	thrice: because vmware workstation needs gcc 5.1 to built the moduls
<teraflop>	kjk: dam taxes... you guys are lucky
<sheep>	teraflop: blame oil subsidies
<d_garbage>	bohverkill, alan is working on it
<kjk>	so i see a lot of implication that gnu/gcc toolchain is the the default, but i wonder if an explicit mention of that in the abs and aur wiki pages might help.
<bohverkill>	d_garbage: k thx, how long ist "soon"? days? weeks?
<teraflop>	!when
<holomorph>	!when
<phrik>	when it's ready.
<phrik>	when it's ready.
<d_garbage>	bohverkill, as soon as he can, i guess
<teraflop>	heh
<bohverkill>	mhhh k
<d_garbage>	you could pay him but he's rather expensive iirc
<c0deweaver>	don't ask for etas. doesn't matter for what. only if you pay for something can you ask for an eta.
<charlesatum>	damn, any tips on how to return from a function a struct in c?
<thrice>	probably also sleeping by now
<nemesys>	anyone have a good xterm guide they like to refer to? trying to see if i can reposition the xterm window via a command line argument so that i can place it in a shell script.
<d_garbage>	yes, he's southern hemisphere
<charlesatum>	s/from a function a struct/a struct from a function/
<sheep>	charlesatum: declare the function's return type as 'struct foo' instead of 'foo'
<kjk>	charlesatum: with a reference?
<charlesatum>	actually, i'm already using typedef
<grawity>	i think usually you return a pointer to struct
<d_garbage>	also i spelled his name wrong, it's allan :)
<grawity>	since not all compilers allow a direct return
<sheep>	gcc allows it iirc
<sheep>	though structs sometimes get really big so it's more common to return a pointer
<charlesatum>	fila.c:55:10: error: returning 'livro' from a function with incompatible result
<charlesatum>	      type 'livro *'; remove *
<charlesatum>	                return *aux;
<charlesatum>	clang pointed to the *
<kjk>	gcc is the bastard offspring of "this would be neat" and "this would be really useful."  i love it.
<charlesatum>	removed it and it worked
<sheep>	remove the * from return *aux;
<sheep>	you were returning the struct instead of the pointer
<sheep>	i think
<thelemonman>	std::move :d

<sheep>	thelemonman: that's c++ though
<thelemonman>	i managed to write a lot of code that does zero allocations with that trick, at the expense of code readability :p
<charlesatum>	i hate converting between charsets
<sheep>	i'd just use std::unique_ptr and std::shared_ptr
<charlesatum>	why don't we live in a world where everybody uses either pure ascci or utf-8?
<charlesatum>	and i forgot how to write ascii correctly
<charlesatum>	two i's, got it.
<charlesatum>	...facepalm
<thelemonman>	sheep, in hindsight yep, but i was excited about trying out std::move
<charlesatum>	why doesn't gedit show the file encoding?
<charlesatum>	oh right, what is -> for in c?

<bobbertson>	oh
<ldk>	...haha
<bobbertson>	hohoho
<bobbertson>	such funny joke
<bobbertson>	i wish i could get osu to run
<ldk>	a term rhythm game would be great, kyou should write one
<ldk>	i'd play it
<bobbertson>	i wonder if its hard to make though
<bobbertson>	like all that refreshing and stuff
<bobbertson>	and it wouldnt look smooth
<bobbertson>	there has to be a reason one doesnt exist already
<ldk>	yeah would be tricky
<ldk>	probably very termemu-dependent performance
<ldk>	endless configurations to target
<wasamasa>	i considered writing one in emacs...
<wasamasa>	that could fulfill the "runs in a terminal" condition
<bobbertson>	damn the osu installer isnt running at all with wine
<thespiritof69>	anyone running linux-mainline and vbox/vmware successfully?
<charlesatum>	terminal based rhytm game... i will add it to my "try to do when bored" list

<teraflop>	!give junka netctl
<phrik>	junka: users having issues with netctl are advised to try alternatives such as systemd-networkd, networkmanager, or connman.
<easo2k>	i like netctl, as long as im not forced to switch ill use it
<arch-tk>	s/netctl/xp/
<arch-tk>	i can see why people like breaking bad.
<arch-tk>	probably for the same reason they like game of thrones.
<arch-tk>	or a similar one at least.
<bobbertson>	how do i refresh my dns cache
<junka>	arch-tk; yes i follow both
<junka>	i like both
<reconmaster>	after updating gdm i get failed logins from pam_authentication like conversations failed, i can login after the 2nd or 3rd attempt, but i can't figure out why pam is giving me trouble
<reconmaster>	switching to slim i get a pam_authentication failure too
<teraflop>	bobbertson: you don't have dns cache, unless you set it up explicitly
<bobbertson>	oh i see
<bobbertson>	cool
<bobbertson>	isnt that like inefficent though
<bobbertson>	it just uses the dns server every single time you look up a name?
<teraflop>	bobbertson: what's your dns problem?
<bobbertson>	well im using this certain super shitty isp
<bobbertson>	where after connecting to it you need to login with an account through your web browser
<threegen>	you only use dns once every few mins or so, so it's not really inefficient.
<bobbertson>	whatever page you try to go to it redirects you to login
<reconmaster>	it only started now that i have upgraded gdm after changing my kernel to linux 4, is there something i need to update?
<bobbertson>	until you login
<threegen>	once you find the ip, the application will remember it for the time being.
<bobbertson>	and you can use your account from 1 device at a time
<bobbertson>	after switching to a phone with wifi and then back
<bobbertson>	for some reason i just get a server cant be reached dns not resolved whatever issue
<namarrgon>	reconmaster: what's in the journal after a failed login attempt?
<threegen>	different dns server addresses? different ip's conflicting? idk.
<teraflop>	...or yeah blame your isp
<earnestly>	demize: did you get any more info on the tracking-assignments thing?
<arch-tk>	i set up unbound on my home server as a caching dns resolver
<arch-tk>	it just forwards
<bobbertson>	im pretty sure the router they are using here is just simply only serving you their login page until you login
<bobbertson>	no way around it
<arch-tk>	or well, caching dns server.
<bobbertson>	its an issue on the routers software side that i cant fix probably
<reconmaster>	namarrgon: well slim complains about a missing .xautority and .xinitrc

<arch-tk>	run df
<charlesatum>	that's an awesome question
<arch-tk>	ausseh: df -h

<reconmaster>	namarrgon: i did -syu
<homerj>	i'm thinking of stuff like my steam games that are in /home
<ausseh>	lol i thought about it first... i'm assuming * makes it anything.
<ausseh>	minus lol - forced habit
<tom^>	homerj: yes? , / takes like 2gb
<ausseh>	assuming this is a no-lol zone.
<homerj>	would be useful to have those on an ssd, although, you could just have /home on a hd, and make another library on a mount that's on the ssd
<tom^>	homerj: so let it be on the ssd too.
<namarrgon>	reconmaster: can you log in on a vt?
<homerj>	yeah, ignore me, i'm a moron
<tom^>	homerj: indeed.
<homerj>	what i said made no sense
<tom^>	homerj: nope
<tom^>	homerj: :p
<threegen>	homerj you can set your steam games anywhere. in my fstab i have /mnt/steamgamesssd mount one of my ssd's for my libary, and it puts games there instead of /home.
<beest>	homerj: go sit in the corner
<reconmaster>	namarrgon: yeah not a problem, i can also get on through ssh. i can even get on with gdm if i try to login with a new user and try the graphical login 2 or 3 times
<homerj>	once in a while, sometimes you just say something totally idiotic, you have to suck it up, admit it and move on
<threegen>	also used ssd for games+os. documents can go on hdd, unless you gotta load a few gb at a time, it's worth it to boot/run faster.
<ausseh>	mount returns a list of mounted place... dev/sda2 on /mnt type ext4 (size-1633524k,mode=700)

<jasabella>	what's the preferred way to minimize privileges in arch... sudo when needed or adding myself to wheel?
<beest>	!grab tom^
<phrik>	beest: tada!
<homerj>	i always forget about boot times, but my threshold for boot times is "can i get a cup of coffee and come back and have it finished"
<jasabella>	(e.g. for reading systemd journal)
<homerj>	any faster than that is useless to me
<jasabella>	ausseh... what are you doing? :)
<ausseh>	working on the installation
<ausseh>	tells me there is not enough space on my /mnt partition
<threegen>	well, it's not just about boot times homerj, but when you log in too. any time loading lots of os parts is slow. it'll make a huge difference in general use, too.
<jasabella>	oooh i just completed mine... removed everything and did it again :d
<jasabella>	oh
<threegen>	my pc boots to the desktop, loading everying, in 5 seconds.
<homerj>	yeah, i've never had an ssd
<jasabella>	how much space you got? what's going on?
<homerj>	i don't know the joys
<ausseh>	threegen: using linux or winblows?
<ausseh>	because i want to install / to my ssd and /home to my hdd
<threegen>	on hdd, i'd probably be on the desktop about...15-20 seconds instead. not too big, but still, the usage will be slower, too, without being on ssd. not the whole time, but first time running apps will be slow as they won't be cached.
<polyzen>	is there someplace that describes when to add hardening_wrapper as a dep?
<jasabella>	mine booted to winblows in about 5-10 seconds
<polyzen>	!wiki security
<phrik>	polyzen: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/security
<threegen>	ausseh linux. :)
<jasabella>	probably close to 6 :)
<threegen>	ausseh you just have to follow the beginners boot guide, and modify your fstab accordingly. it's not hard. i'll show you mine.
<polyzen>	!wiki hardening wrapper
<phrik>	polyzen: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/developerwiki:security
<jasabella>	ausseh... yeah, you create your partitions, mount accordingly and stuff
<arch-tk>	ausseh: just run umount /mnt and remount and tell me what mount /dev/sda2 /mnt -v says
<threegen>	yep, that.
<jasabella>	ausseh... is this your first linux install?
<ausseh>	not first linux, but first arch...
<namarrgon>	reconmaster: pacman -qm
<ausseh>	i've had several linux distros
<ausseh>	umount: /mnt: traget is busy
<threegen>	ausseh if it is your first install, best advice i can give is boot into mint livecd and partition your system, first, how you want it. because that's the hardest/most time consuming part in the install if you don't do it before with gui tools. :)
<ausseh>	target even
<threegen>	plus, easy to screw up.
<threegen>	i rein stalled twice because i forgot some parts of my system, lol.
<codebam>	i remember there being a flag that i needed to activate for my intel processor for linux-grsec. i dont remember the name of it and i couldnt find it on google. does anyone here know what i needed to add to my grub.default to make it boot without the kernel panic?
<jasabella>	so in linux, you realise that you dont have separate 'drives' like in windows right? everything is under the one directory and the different drives/partitions slot in at different places as 'folders'

<arch-tk>	ausseh: lsblk
<threegen>	ausseh how the installer works...you make links to drives, and arch installs the files for the os to the link to the drive you made. boot to the drive you linked to. and any others, to any other partitions/drives you linked to. it then remembers all the information and makes your fstab for you. but you have to mount in a certain order/way.
<arch-tk>	ausseh: you're mounting the cd
<arch-tk>	or whatever
<jasabella>	threegen... you dont use discard with your ssd?
<hyo0301>	help sound

<threegen>	jasabella whatcha mean?
<sudokode>	jasabella: not all ssds support discard
<ausseh>	shows /mnt as 216mb
<jasabella>	threegen... it enables trim support

<codebam>	jasabella: doesnt discard affect performance?
<arch-tk>	ausseh: yes, run lsblk
<hyo0301>	sound seems ok, but i get none out
<sudokode>	it enables queued trim support
<threegen>	why would i want to run trim support/discard?
<ausseh>	that's what i did
<sudokode>	if you don't have that (and a lot of ssds don't), you have to trim manually
<codebam>	ah
<sudokode>	like by using fstrim.service
<jasabella>	hyo0301... new install?
<mvdw>	hyo0301: you ran $ alsamixer
<threegen>	i have a sandisk 64gb ultra, and an 512gb evo 840.

<jasabella>	you install alsa-utils, unmute the channels with alsamixer
<hyo0301>	mvdw: yes i did, it's on 100%
<codebam>	what does trim actually do. does it get rid of bad blocks or something?
<sudokode>	threegen: the 840 might have queued trim, but i don't know. it might just be their pro line
<hyo0301>	jasabella: wat?
<sudokode>	!give threegen discard
<phrik>	threegen: if you get output from `sudo smartctl -l gplog,0x13 /dev/sda | grep 0000:` then congratulations, your ssd has queued trim support, and you can use the 'discard' option in fstab.
<threegen>	it is an 840 pro i believer.

<jasabella>	plasma5 is magical
<sudokode>	"a trim command (commonly typeset as trim) allows an operating system to inform a solid-state drive (ssd) which blocks of data are no longer considered in use and can be wiped internally.[1]"

<codebam>	so could i run trim on any sd card, usb, or ssd?
<sudokode>	so you set it up to trim once a day or once a week
<threegen>	hmm, seems neither of my drives have it, running that command...although the output from the bare command doesn't seem good...hmm..
<sudokode>	whereas with queued trim, you can let the ssd know without having to perform the operation right away
<threegen>	any secondary way to check trim support?
<sudokode>	codebam: no
<sudokode>	only ssds have trim support
<codebam>	oh never mind. yea they'd need to have trim support yea
<sudokode>	well actually
<woodennails>	sudokode, is trim not enabled by default in arch?
<codebam>	but i could run it on my phone
<sudokode>	ehh
<codebam>	:p
<sudokode>	the multimediacard and sd erase (cmd38) command provides similar functionality to the ata trim command, although it requires that erased blocks be overwritten with either zeroes or ones. emmc 4.5 further defines a "discard" sub-operation that more closely matches ata trim in that the contents of discarded blocks can be considered indeterminate (i.e., "don't care").
<ausseh>	could someone tell me how to delete /mnt please?
<sudokode>	ausseh: why would you do that?
<jasabella>	why are you doing that?
<ausseh>	because it's a mere 216mb and it needs to be ~500mb.
<ausseh>	for installation
<sudokode>	that doesn't make any sense
<sudokode>	oh you mean the filesystem mounted there
<sudokode>	only 500?
<ausseh>	^
<jasabella>	what you need to resize is the partition
<sudokode>	sounds like you messed something up
<threegen>	seems both my drives, the 840 evo, and sandisk ultra 64gb offer trim. although that command stated did not accurately state that.
<jasabella>	 /mnt is a directory
<jasabella>	use fdisk/gfdisk/cfdisk/parted/gparted
<sudokode>	you should mount your / there, then mount /boot to /mnt/boot
<mvdw>	ausseh: follow the beginners guide on partioning and mouning on the archwiki.
<jasabella>	one of thoes
<ausseh>	idk, it said i couldn't finish downloading because the size of mnt was too small.
<jasabella>	if you need to resize or something
<mvdw>	ausseh: you mounted the wrong partition.
<thrice>	in this case, /mnt is a mount point.  you want to look at the thing that is actually mounted there
<jasabella>	i hope it wasnt his uefi boot partition *fingers crossed*
<threegen>	lol
<sudokode>	ausseh: yeah because that's where your root filesystem should be mounted
<sudokode>	500mb sounds like a /boot
<mvdw>	yep
<jasabella>	mmhmmm
<mvdw>	uefi.
<sudokode>	well esp
<ausseh>	it was 216mb and said download was ~485mb
<mvdw>	first things first, do you have a efi partition?
<hyo0301>	mvdw: now what
<ausseh>	doesn't look like it -_-
<ausseh>	just swap and filesystem
<sudokode>	are you using efi?
<mvdw>	are you single or dual boot.

<jasabella>	i hope your hdd has trim support (you checked right?0
<mvdw>	"/ (root)", "swap" & if going for efi "efi"
<threegen>	it does, i checked them both.
<jasabella>	you can lose data if it doesnt! :|
<jasabella>	ok
<krav>	hdd != ssd
<reconmaster>	namarrgon: same error
<threegen>	for reference, even the sandisk 64gb has support, as well as my 840 evo 612gb.
<threegen>	512*
<reisio>	sssd != ssd
<krav>	different terms :(
<mvdw>	ausseh: swap will be your ram * 2.
<jasabella>	yeah it's ssd
<jasabella>	sorry
<sudokode>	threegen: has queued support?
<mvdw>	efi around 512mb
<reisio>	y'know what, i think mostly, strings that are inequal are inequal
<reisio>	on average
<ausseh>	great
<ausseh>	:|
<mvdw>	and "root" the reamining.
<sudokode>	i.e. discard support
<reisio>	like asdf != fdsa, etc.
<ausseh>	that kinda sucks
<reisio>	mvdw: that's a very old rule of thumb
<reisio>	incredibly outdated
<ausseh>	oh, good... what should it be?
<threegen>	sudokode how do you check _queued_ trim support?
<mvdw>	do you have a better guideline reisio?
<ausseh>	because i've completely undersized it
<reisio>	for modern hardware, swap needn't exceed ram
<sudokode>	!discard
<phrik>	if you get output from `sudo smartctl -l gplog,0x13 /dev/sda | grep 0000:` then congratulations, your ssd has queued trim support, and you can use the 'discard' option in fstab.
<jasabella>	i dont even have a swap and have swappieness set to zero, i only have 8gb of ram
<reisio>	mvdw: yeah ^
<sudokode>	like so
<reisio>	for modern hardware the only issue is _if_ you want to suspend all of your ram, you need enough room to safely store it all
<namarrgon>	reconmaster: you tried it with a clean, new user-account and it does exactly the same, right?
<reisio>	though modern suspend implementations will happily clip away what won't fit
<ausseh>	i have 16gb ram... where should my swap be?
<threegen>	reisio you should have at least the size of ram for sleep.
<reisio>	ausseh: depends on if you want to store all 16gb when you suspend or not
<reisio>	threegen: think i just said that, my man...
<threegen>	i'd make it at least 16gb. 17gb should be okay.
<mvdw>	i'd say around 24. ausseh
<ausseh>	geez xd
<mvdw>	like those 8gb matter.
<reisio>	heh
<ausseh>	i think i'll just start over
<reisio>	wow that girl walks fast...
<sudokode>	you can still use discard without discard support, but you'll be triming on every related operation
<jasabella>	is suspending a good way to kill a ssd?
<reisio>	ausseh: nah, this isn't windows
<threegen>	ausseh it's okay, once it's installed, you'll love arch. :p
<sudokode>	usually it just makes your deletes slower
<mvdw>	yes, repartition your drive.
<ausseh>	i hope so :|||
<reisio>	although i will say, if you ever want a temporary bare metal install of windows for lulz, you can nuke a large swap partition like >16gb, to make room
<mvdw>	ausseh: follow the arch beginner guide.
<ausseh>	and i already pressed reset :|
<ausseh>	>:|
<mvdw>	please.
<ausseh>	i'll do that, if you can link me..
<reisio>	big swap partitions make great temporary space
<ausseh>	apparently youtube isn't sufficient.

<phrik>	read this! all of it, twice! your answer is probably here! http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/beginners%27_guide
<mvdw>	ah thanks.
<mvdw>	when something is unclear there, you ask it here.
<mvdw>	easy as that.
<sudokode>	reisio: i used to split all my hdds up into 4 primary partitions and use them in lvm
<hyo0301>	why doesn't my join/leave msgs hide?
<threegen>	sudokode know of any way to check queued trim support? my hdparm has trim support marked on both. most features are marked, actually. so i should be okay?
<reisio>	sudokode: and now?
<sudokode>	then if i needed an extra 200gb or so, i could just remove it from the vg
<reisio>	lvm is a great solution for a problem almost nobody has :d
<sudokode>	i still use lvm, so it's possible, but i just don't worry about windows
<sudokode>	like ever
<ausseh>	arch supports dual monitors?
<reisio>	nor i :d
<reisio>	it was convenient once, though
<sudokode>	many many monitors
<threegen>	ausseh arch runs linux and linux software. if your drivers do, sure.
<reisio>	i wanted to try this game a friend was playing
<ausseh>	awesome :)
<reisio>	nuked my swap, installed, played for a bit, restored swap
<homerj>	what game?
<threegen>	but yes, all gpu outputs should work fine.
<reisio>	uhhhhh what was it called
<mvdw>	why wouldn't arch support duals.
<mvdw>	just get the right drivers.
<reconmaster>	namarrgon: yeah, same problem

<rrooij>	is there some way to list all the properiertary packages installed with pacman? without using the your-freedom parabola package?
<mvdw>	ausseh:

<spyhawk>	rrooij: no.
<ausseh>	what's the difference? beginners guide suggests this :|
<jasabella>	i used cgdisk for my gpt partitions :)
<spyhawk>	rrooij: but you might want to use expac to list the license next to each package
<reconmaster>	every time once i log into the vt, i did that when i was trying to figure out if it was gdm or nvidia, it seems to be ok if i roll gdm back to 3.16.0.1 rather than 3.16.1.1 and then i have to roll nvida back to 346.* and linux < 3.20
<jasabella>	instead of mbr
<mvdw>	personaly preference it is ausseh.
<namarrgon>	and they say parted is easier! look at the amount of text one has to type...
<ausseh>	o.o
<mvdw>	i used cfdisk so i can asnwer questions on that.
<mvdw>	you're free to use whatever you please of course.
<rrooij>	spyhawk: okay. thanks for the tip. since the your-freedom package is very strict in what they consider non-free (hell, even firefox is on the list because of the trademarked logo), i was looking for an alternative.
<namarrgon>	reconmaster: pacman -qs nvidia
<reconmaster>	namarrgon: i can try rolling back again now that i fixed the microcode problem
<spyhawk>	rrooij: if i'm not mistaken, expac -q '%n %l' should do the trick
<reisio>	rrooij: i bet there's some way to parse all the licenses
<namarrgon>	reconmaster: post the output of ^ and 'pacman -qs libgw'

<prinsen>	what is the replacement of pand (bluetooth)? i want to do ip networking (not tethering) over a bluetooth link
<sudokode>	that is always going to be tethering afaik
<sudokode>	if you create a point-to-point link, there are only two things i'd call it... ad hoc or tethering
<sudokode>	i should say host to host
<sudokode>	but anyway, that doesn't mean you can't do networking over it
<sudokode>	what are you trying to do?
<jasabelle>	heh bluetooth doesnt work like that?
<grazzolini>	prinsen: i believe you can achieve it mainly on userspace using ppp
<sudokode>	jasabelle: they give it the fancy term pan
<grazzolini>	prinsen: it has been years since i've done bluetooth networking though.
<grazzolini>	sudokode: not that much fancy
<sudokode>	because omg you're not hooking up a cable between two systems so now you can do awesome stuff
<grazzolini>	sudokode: but, bluetooth isn't that fancy either.
<sudokode>	grazzolini: ofc it isn't
<grazzolini>	sudokode: i believe the fancier thing bluetooth have is being designed to not interfere 802.11.
<grazzolini>	(not that much anyway)
<sudokode>	why would it?
<sudokode>	bluetooth is 802.11
<sheep>	i thought it was 802.15
<sudokode>	it can interfere on a short range because bluetooth likes to be a dick
<grazzolini>	sudokode: it isn't.
<sudokode>	isn't what?
<reconmaster>	namarrgon: none of those things seemed to work, last time i saw this problem rolling back nivida, linux, and gdm kind of work, now gdm doesn't start with that combination
<grazzolini>	sudokode: although it does transmit in the same frequency as 2.4, it doesn't interfere with normal wifi operation
<braindamage>	bluetooth is 802.15.1
<sudokode>	oh
<sudokode>	meh
<grazzolini>	sudokode: which is one of the reasons why many laptops have both the wifi and bluetooth chip integrated
<sudokode>	this is why we should be using wireless usb
<sudokode>	cause lol ieee
<braindamage>	the problem isn't that
<sudokode>	grazzolini: well, you'd need both anyway
<braindamage>	the problem is that they share the same radio channels
<prinsen>	i just want to do ip networking between two devises
<reconmaster>	namarrgon: thanks for helping me look into it
<namarrgon>	reconmaster: you are on linux-lts/nvidia-lts now?
<braindamage>	and smart chips have radios that temp exclude eachother when transmitting to minimize interference
<reconmaster>	i was but the same problem
<reconmaster>	same segfault in dmesg about gnome-shell'
<sudokode>	grazzolini: trying to do full duplex on two different protocols on the same antenna is insane
<grazzolini>	braindamage: exactly. and bluetooth was designed with that in mind
<prinsen>	gazzerh: i will lookup ppp
<grazzolini>	sudokode: you should read the bluetooth expect. because that's exactly what it's done
<namarrgon>	reconmaster: pacman -qkk
<sudokode>	ew god
<grazzolini>	sudokode: long answer short, bluetooth transmits between 802.11 tx.
<sudokode>	no wonder mobile devices suck when you turn on bluetooth and wifi
<grazzolini>	sudokode: exactly
<braindamage>	blame the dicks for having very few ism channels and trying to shove everything in
<sudokode>	but then again, all cordless phones are 2.4ghz and 5ghz now
<holomorph>	interference is fun
<grazzolini>	sudokode: which one of the main reasons i don't use bluetooth anymore. and i used to develop bluetooth mobile applications. it's one of those things that when you read the spec you say: wtf?
<sudokode>	interference probably isn't the main issue
<sudokode>	it's probably the antenna use
<braindamage>	except it is interference
<braindamage>	the antenna isn't the problem
<sudokode>	is worse than timesharing an antenna?
<earnestly>	dagle: look into ponylang
<braindamage>	even if they used sep antennas, the problem remains
<braindamage>	they deafen eachother
<sudokode>	why do we even make things?
<sudokode>	we're really dumb
<braindamage>	because antennas are linear, amplifiers not
<grazzolini>	huahuuhahua
<sudokode>	like i could have designed a better spec
<sudokode>	and i don't know shit about rf
<braindamage>	well, trying to document yourself before making comments would be a good start
<braindamage>	because it's very noticeable
<sudokode>	look at all the fucks i give
<grazzolini>	sudokode: there were regulatory issues and mainly no rf space. that's why they developed everything on 2.4
<sudokode>	fuckin fcc
<grazzolini>	sudokode: it's not only then
<sudokode>	:(
<braindamage>	well, there's other slots, but, the bandwith is much more limited
<braindamage>	and therefore the speed
<braindamage>	2.4ghz was the only acceptable channel, 5 ghz band become acceptable with tech evolving
<grazzolini>	braindamage: which is why 802.11ac demands more antennas

<grazzolini>	there are only 2 ways to improve speeds on the crowded 2.4 space. increase tx power and/or an array of antennas.
<braindamage>	also, as frequency increases, you run into other problems, such as attenuation being much stronger, along with circuits becoming more complex and physical tollerances smaller
<braindamage>	no, you don't want stronger tx, you want stronger power density
<braindamage>	ie directional antennas
<braindamage>	then you both reject interferences and improve signal strength
<braindamage>	problem: you need to aim them
<petantik>	spatial diversity/mimo
<namarrgon>	reconmaster: what did you change in /etc/gdm/custom.conf ?
<braindamage>	also in some legislations even directional antennas can push you to illegal territory since the legislation can be on eirp
<grazzolini>	braindamage: yes. most countries legislate on eirp. but there has been some change on this
<grazzolini>	braindamage: which is one of the reasons i love 802.11ac beamforming.
<grazzolini>	braindamage: it's elegantly simple and effective

*	topic for #archlinux is: welcome to arch linux world domination, inc. <+> read: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=57205 <+> be patient with those willing to learn and be kind to those willing to teach. <+> hubble is 25, all hail our science overlord: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2oiaa1tdre
<hyo0301>	how do you change border thickness in i3?
<hyo0301>	oh i already wrote that
<namarrgon>	i3 has a nice user-guide on the homepage
<namarrgon>	it's on a single page iirc, so using the built-in search of your browser should give you a hint or two as how to do that
<aias>	if i'm using systemd through its systemctl cli, will enabled unit files always appear with their sym links under /etc/systemd/system ?
<aias>	i.e. no matter what i enabled, it will dump a symlink there somewhere?
<woodennails>	just installed linux and wondering how i go about sorting my drives/folders, i have everything installed to my ssd at the minute and my other internal hd's are just sitting there... what would you guys reccomend? i will be storing my videos pictures etc on this other hard drive
<reconmaster>	namarrgon: hey did that work, storm is making the net connection spotty
<threegen>	woodennails make your /home folder the hdd.
<threegen>	but it's probs too late since you've installed everything. :)p
<holomorph>	aias: unless you use options to tell it to put the symlink somewhere else, yes
<holomorph>	aias: see systemctl(1)
<namarrgon>	reconmaster: yeah.
<holomorph>	and probably systemd.unit(5)
<namarrgon>	reconmaster: add "waylandenable=false" to [daemon], disconnect all other displays, mv /etc/x11/xorg.conf{,-backup} then restart gnome, post new log if it fails again
<woodennails>	do i just create partition and then put that in the fstab?
<teraflop>	threegen: hey why "make your /home folder the hdd"?
<woodennails>	you guys do any gaming on arch?
<reconmaster>	alright, i'll make those changes and come back. lost wireless so i am doing this on the angry computer
<namarrgon>	woodennails: yup, playing find-the-bug-in-gdm 2.5 right now. almost all achievements unlocked!
<threegen>	woodennails you can. it's however you want to do it now, as no way is right because it's supposed to be done during install. all folder locations need to be done earlier.
<threegen>	woodennails i also do gaming too. playing tf2 now. :)
<woodennails>	oh nice
<hyo0301>	does anyone here know how to make borders in i3 thicker?
<woodennails>	threegen, i left arch to mac then back to windows to play games and now back to arch
<cirrus_minor>	yes
<woodennails>	kinda missed it but a bit intimidated
<woodennails>	if i was to make /home on hdd.... would that mean all my apps get installed there?
<threegen>	nope, all apps are usually in /usr/lib, on the ssd.
<cirrus_minor>	woodennails:  no
<threegen>	some apps that install to your home would, but that's not many.
<sheep>	threegen: you mean /usr
<threegen>	many bad ones*
<cirrus_minor>	woodennails:  your config files and the like be in ~
<sheep>	/usr/lib just contains the libraries
<cirrus_minor>	aka home
<threegen>	well, yeah, /usr, /usr/bin, /usr/lib, etc.
<woodennails>	yeah im just paranoid about the ssd filling up as its only 128gb
<woodennails>	gnome is kinda clunky :(
<cirrus_minor>	woodennails:  use a lighter wm ? i3, dwm  etc etc
<threegen>	woodennails i have a 64gb. and only have 20gb for my root, it's a good size. you won't go over it, just make sure your games don't do there too. lol.
<lkirk>	xmonad!
<teraflop>	woodennails: it does mean that youll have a bottleneck(?) since there is a lot . stuff in /home instead of the ssd
<lkirk>	except for that whole ghc thing....
<woodennails>	threegen, what do you do with the remainder of the space
<threegen>	i have a "small ssd" on /mnt for anything i'd need 40gb of free space for, like fast decoding of files and such.
<threegen>	my games are on the 512gb  ssd. all my files on my 1tb hdd.
<threegen>	not close to filling any of them up.
<woodennails>	the files on the 1tb hdd... where do you mount that
<woodennails>	my hdd seems to be mounted on /run/media
<threegen>	my 1tb hdd was told to be the /home folder on install
<ausseh>	i'm installing / onto an sdd and /home onto a hdd. should i have the hdd as primary or extended?
<threegen>	ausseh i'd do primary. 2 partitons, one for files, one for swap. :)
<cirrus_minor>	primary
<threegen>	only need extended if you need a massive ammount of partitons. :?)
<jasabella>	he's using gpt so it shouldnt really matter should it?
<ausseh>	o.o
<namarrgon>	gpt doesn't have that concept anyway
<threegen>	or have to make 2 partitions on a windows machine that already uses 3, you'd make an extended partition, with 2 sub partitions.
<threegen>	nope, it shouldn't.
<jasabella>	mmhmmm
<ausseh>	i have my swap on my ssd
<ausseh>	which remembering now, i heard it can corrupt an ssd?
<jasabella>	it'll make things faster but wears it out
<jasabella>	(if you swap a lot)
<woodennails>	threegen, so install / on ssd 20gb, and /home on hdd.... where do you mount your 1tb hdd? also do you partition your /usr/ and /boot/ seperately?
<threegen>	nope. woodennails: / is on 20gb ssd partiton, the other 40gb is mount to a /mnt/ folder for use if i needed it. 1tb hdd is mounted as /home, which should be done during install because of user profile creation. and the 512gb ssd is also in the /mnt/ folder.
<ausseh>	would my swap be primary or extended? o_o
<ausseh>	and the files would be primary?
<threegen>	primary for everything.
<sheep>	are you using gpt?
<holomorph>	wot
<ausseh>	yes
<sheep>	then your question makes no sense
<sheep>	gpt only has primary parititions
<sheep>	though it can have up to 128
<jasabella>	yea primary/seconeary only makes sense if you are using mbr and bios boot
<earnestly>	holomorph: you need to read http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/6952
<ausseh>	sorry, beginner o.o
<jasabella>	thought so ;d
<za3k>	i'm setting up hibernate. systemd method seems to fail (reboots on resume) but 'echo "disk" > /sys/power/state' works perfectly
<woodennails>	threegen, nice thanks so much for your help pal :)
<holomorph>	earnestly: something tells me i'll get as much out of it as the medical paper i read the other week :p
<earnestly>	holomorph: yes, knowledge
<woodennails>	threegen, where would i go to find out how to put one of myt other hdd's in the mnt folder?
<earnestly>	holomorph: anyway, it's just interesting
<mvdw>	swap is swap. it doesn't really go primary ausseh.
<threegen>	woodennails read my pm
<mvdw>	hows the beginners guide comming along ausseh.
<holomorph>	earnestly: looks interesting
<ausseh>	slow lol i'm having help in pm as well
<mvdw>	you're still on the partitioning?
<earnestly>	holomorph: it's pretty readable, they specifically avoid lambda-calculus notation to make it clearer as well
<earnestly>	holomorph: that is, they implement their idea in a simple language and use that to express it
<holomorph>	earnestly: oh, that sounds nice
<reconmaster>	namarrgon: http://pastebin.com/mtp51mh8
<earnestly>	holomorph: it's also the paper that is very much what pony is about, basically
<reconmaster>	no dice

<jasabella>	i took a day for my first install but wanted to understand what i was doing :d
<holomorph>	earnestly: is it one of the references of the paper you posted earlier?
<earnestly>	holomorph: this is new
<holomorph>	ah

<earnestly>	heh
<hyo0301>	after doing makepkg -sic
<hyo0301>	where does the font go?
<cirrus_minor>	oh my
<h4k1m>	hello there
<h4k1m>	i need to install archlinux but apparently only the 32 bits version is working on my laptop
<reisio>	h4k1m: what processor does your laptop have?
<h4k1m>	the 64 bits doesnt seem to be recognized
<cirrus_minor>	h4k1m:  that may be due to your processor
<hyo0301>	ya just ignore me
<cirrus_minor>	ok
<reisio>	hyo0301: if you insist
<hyo0301>	...
<h4k1m>	reisio, cirrus_minor  same thing happened to me on opensuse 12 bcos of acpi if i recall
<h4k1m>	a minute i ll see how to get the cpu information on freebsd
<hyo0301>	please
<hyo0301>	i really want the liberation font
<reisio>	hyo0301: so install it
<hyo0301>	i did
<h4k1m>	reisio, cirrus_minor: i have a pentium(r) dual-core cpu       t4400  @ 2.20ghz
<h4k1m>	a slow laptop i have to admit
<cirrus_minor>	hyo0301:  put it in /etc/fonts and update font cache
<hyo0301>	but what now? where is it? typing *font: liberation doesn't work in urxvt
<h4k1m>	is it bcos of acpi (like for opensuse)
<h4k1m>	im just curious, i'm going to install the 32 bits version anyway
<hyo0301>	cirrus_minor: what?
<cirrus_minor>	h4k1m:  idk seems like that cpu can indeed do x64
<reisio>	h4k1m: that's a 64-bit processor
<hyo0301>	i just downloaded the tarball, did tar -xf, makepkg -sic, now what?
<reisio>	hyo0301: now stop, you're doing it wrong
<hyo0301>	??????????????
<cirrus_minor>	lol
<lonewulf`>	good call reisio
<lonewulf`>	heh

<h4k1m>	reisio, cirrus_minor: it is restarting after starting to load some stuff
<h4k1m>	i cant see it load the acpi modules (like it did on the 32 bits version)
<reisio>	h4k1m: try another live os
<cirrus_minor>	use pacman -s hyo0301
<h4k1m>	reisio, you mean another version? (im using the live cd btw the last version 01.05.15)
<reisio>	h4k1m: could try another version of the same live os, too, sure
<cn>	error: target not found: hyo0301
<cn>	help
<reisio>	heh
<hyo0301>	reisio: ? where are the turoial
<jones_>	anyone got any good alternatives to firefox and chrome for webbrowsing?
<cn>	curl
<mvdw>	lynx jones_
<cirrus_minor>	hyo0301:  dood if you cant install a font, maybe arch isnt for you ?
<jones_>	lol
<h4k1m>	reisio, i'll stick to the 32 bits version for the time being it wont be an issue
<h4k1m>	just a last question before starting the installation process
<reisio>	h4k1m: waste of a 64-bit proc
<mvdw>	seriously, why not use either of chrome/ffx?
<reisio>	hyo0301: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman#installing_specific_packages
<phrik>	title: pacman - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<h4k1m>	reisio, but it's not really a fast cpu...
<reisio>	h4k1m: irrelevant
<reisio>	be even slower if you use software made for processors from 20 years prior
<h4k1m>	reisio, yes that's right
<teraflop>	hmmm whats the name of that bash script that runs a videoclip in ascii?
<jones_>	i mean it's fine, but i wanted to see if there was somthing cleaner and simpler to use
<braindamage>	teraflop: i don't know for a script, but search for libcaca
<cloudef>	!rickroll
<phrik>	curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keroserene/rickrollrc/master/roll.sh | bash
<h4k1m>	i'm having a dual boot between freebsd and windows (the bootloader is from freebsd)
<mvdw>	firefox is your best go, you don't want to lose support do you jones_?
<h4k1m>	if i install archlinux over the windows partition, wont it coz troubles to the freebsd bootloader? or will it just overwrite it?
<teraflop>	braindamage: one that grabs anc ascii video of guys dancing and singin'
<cloudef>	!give teraflop rickroll
<phrik>	teraflop: curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keroserene/rickrollrc/master/roll.sh | bash
<teraflop>	cloudef: thanks!
<threegen>	h4k1m you can re-install any bootloader after the arch install and it'll autoconfigure everything again.
<jones_>	you can always have firefox to fall back on if all else fail, either way
<h4k1m>	threegen, thanks i'll give it a try now by overwriting it with grub
<hyo0301>	reisio: doesn't work gg
<sheep>	is there a way to tell if an address is ipv6 or ipv4 with a command line utility?
<threegen>	h4k1m okay good luck.
<mvdw>	may the gods be with you h4k1m.
<mvdw>	jones_: very true. but a general browser seems like a good idea.
<mvdw>	if you're really eager to not be mainstream -- you can try epiphany or something.
<h4k1m>	mvdw, cheers
<reisio>	hyo0301: what doesn't?
<hyo0301>	i installed ttf-liberation
<hyo0301>	now i did urxvt.font: liberation
<hyo0301>	i don't get that font in urxvt
<moetunes>	dwb is pretty good
<mvdw>	hyo0301: have you tried looking online?
<reisio>	hyo0301: xrdb ~/.whatever
<mvdw>	xrdb -merge ~/.xresources'
<mvdw>	s/'//
<polyzen>	is there something like distcc for python?
<reisio>	urxvt.font:xft:liberation mono:pixelsize=12
<reisio>	polyzen: yeah, a python interpreter on anther system
<hyo0301>	mvdw: i look online before i ask here, else i wouldn't
<hyo0301>	reisio: i did merge and load, no workerino like memes

<mvdw>	duckduckgo
<hyo0301>	reisio: wow thanks now it works, i just needed that freaking xft
<hyo0301>	mvdw: it didn't mention xft required
<pharpend>	hey guys. i just got a new monitor. i plugged it in, xrandr detects it. however, i can't get any window managers to send output to it
<miffe>	sheep: are you running gummiboot? can you do a cmp /boot/efi/gummiwhatever /usr/lib/gummiboot/gummibootia32.efi?
<sheep>	miffe: i'm on bios
<miffe>	too bad
<mvdw>	it would if you did a good search ;) hyo0301.
<ausseh>	during mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/home - returned "mount: wrong fs time, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sda2, missing codepage or helper program, or other error"
<sheep>	miffe: i've used it in a vm before, and i think the source code just copies over /usr/lib/gummiboot/gummibootx64.efi
<arch-tk>	wasamasa: this sayonara plugin is a bit useless
<pharpend>	when i start x11, the monitor lights up briefly (nothing on it), and then says "no signal detected", goes into standby
<wasamasa>	arch-tk: well, yeah
<pharpend>	so i have a monitor on my desk, to which i can't send output
<reisio>	hyo0301: it's not required, but you want it
<arch-tk>	wasamasa: i don't see anything particularly hard to grasp about :bd and :q
<wasamasa>	arch-tk: i hoped for more since it had a cool name
<pharpend>	xrandr detects it. i've tried rebooting
<miffe>	sheep: ill try that then. have to do it from windows, will be fun :)
<arch-tk>	and why the fuck would you ever need :close ?
<s00pcan>	yesterday i found out vim can't detect commands if longer commands exist
<arch-tk>	isn't :close just a slightly shitty :quit
<arch-tk>	unless you use it to close window n
<s00pcan>	e.g., :git (when undefined) expects longer :gitwhatever commands to match and throws and error
<wasamasa>	s00pcan: sounds like a fundamental limitation of its parser for these
<wasamasa>	s00pcan: emacs got something similiar for keychords
<s00pcan>	i just wanted my binding to be conditional if fugitive was installed
<wasamasa>	if something defined a key as part of a sequence, you can no longer use it on its own for a command
<s00pcan>	anyway, didn't know about gs.  there are so many bindings to g that it's always surprising
<s00pcan>	:close is windows, just checked
<sheep>	does anyone know how to check whether an ip address is ipv4 or ipv6 from a shell script?
<polyzen>	https://ptpb.pw/he2f
<mvdw>	sheep: are there no external source you can throw it against with curl?
<polyzen>	"error: failed to create package file." yet there is a package

<polyzen>	well, the end of the output
<polyzen>	miffe, nope
<sheep>	tomty89: i also need to make sure the address is actually valid
<polyzen>	and i've already rm'd the file and tried to recreate it
<polyzen>	previous changed the pkg compression from gz to xz
<polyzen>	sly
<hyo0301>	g-reat
<hyo0301>	more problems :)
<polyzen>	grrreat
<polyzen>	they're more than good
<hyo0301>	i know right :d

<polyzen>	!grab s00pcan
<phrik>	polyzen: tada!
<hyo0301>	:ddddddddddd
<s00pcan>	so nvim has :terminal
<starling000>	is there an argument you can pass to grub that will prevent x from starting at boot? i think something happened to it that's making my system hang.
<s00pcan>	i learn this the day after i have the idea to put tmux in a vim window
<s00pcan>	i've yet to see which plugins of mine are usable before i think about using nvim seriously
<hyo0301>	does anyone use tox?
<s00pcan>	never heard of tox
<s00pcan>	python virtualenv management and testing tool
<mvdw>	hyo0301: no.
<hyo0301>	what is nvim?
<mvdw>	there's no good reason to use it.
<hyo0301>	worth using?
<hyo0301>	mvdw: if you like anonymity it is
<mvdw>	google > what is nvim
<s00pcan>	mvdw: neovim
<mvdw>	get a irc cloak and you'll be in the same level.
<s00pcan>	eh?

<braindamage>	or xine
<earnestly>	it's not incorrect
<s00pcan>	yeah i saw esd on that and wondered what it was
<earnestly>	it just looks more complex than it is, i.e.
<earnestly>	!pulseaudio
<phrik>	i've run out of arguments against pulseaudio, so here is a terribly outdated graph that looks scary: http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/operating-systems/linux/audio-mess.png
<usr13>	tomty89: i found that the time was not at all right.  i fixed that, but still getting same error.
<hyo0301>	oh lord
<tomty89>	usr13: you need to restart the service which initialize the keyring
<usr13>	tomty89: which service would that be?
<tomty89>	usr13: ehh i don't recall the name, can you grep failed it in systemctl
<tomty89>	*or list failed *shrug*
<reconmaster>	namarrgon: hey sorry, storm knocked out our connection at work. thanks again for all your help. if you had any other ideas just let me know.
<namarrgon>	reconmaster: no, sorry. i have no idea what's wrong.
<hyo0301>	should i try oss?
<earnestly>	no
<namarrgon>	reconmaster: it doesn't seemt to be related to the other reported gdm issues on the bugtracker. perhaps you should file another one.
<hyo0301>	but this freaking alsa is unfixable earnestly
<tomty89>	sigh
<reconmaster>	namarrgon: yeah, i've got enough journal files accumulated now. i'll just file them over there tonight

<earnestly>	hyo0301: do you really think that's true or are you being perhaps a little bit irrational?

<tomty89>	foul

<tomty89>	just use osx
<lmnop__>	yea
<s00pcan>	hyo0301: so what's the problem anyway?  i haven't read your stuff yet
<tomty89>	^^^^
<reisio>	hah
<tomty89>	!notworking
<s00pcan>	i feel you on being annoyed with linux audio setup, because i was there, so i'm willing to help sort-of
<reisio>	i was thinking of ways to make fun of 'osx' as an os name
<reisio>	l4, linux-4, plus it's confusing as if it's l4, yay
<reisio>	but for true parity it'd have to be k4, kernel #4
<reisio>	or in der latin: kq
<tomty89>	but it's not the only kernel in the world
<reisio>	you're onto something there
<reisio>	i heard there are oses other than mac's, too
<reisio>	kiv, linux-4
<arch-tk>	:q
<hyo0301>	zzzz
<namarrgon>	weee, 4.0.2
<mvdw>	might be a really stupid question but regarding vim color schemes.
<hyo0301>	allsa
<namarrgon>	and still no changelog for 3.19.7
<mvdw>	they all state their colors with ctermfg=13, ctermfg=212 and all that. where to really get a good grasp on how these look?
<mvdw>	no one ._.?
<tomty89>	!g palette
<phrik>	tomty89: palette - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palette>
<halfwit>	hello, world!
<reisio>	it's "hello, world"
<tomty89>	hello, world
<halfwit>	let's not do this.
<reisio>	chicken
<halfwit>	bwak -is- my middle name, so yeah.
<reisio>	nice
<hyo0301>	if mm is highlighted, is it muted or unmuted?
<hyo0301>	@alsamixer
<mvdw>	highlighted means unmuted.
<mvdw>	for me it is.
<mvdw>	it's 00 or mm
<usr13>	in install.txt i see:  "add console keynmap and font preferences in /etc/vconsole.conf" but not sure what to do. can someone elaborate on this just a bit?
<hyo0301>	pls try to support http://superuser.com/questions/912553/no-sound-on-arch-linux-alsa
<phrik>	title: audio - no sound on arch linux (alsa) - super user (at superuser.com)
<tomty89>	mm is muted
<xyzaffa1r>	when running grub-mkconfig it keeps freezing at os-prober, i assume because for what ever reason grub-mount is running reguardless of how many times i kill it.
<tomty89>	00 is unmuted
<xyzaffa1r>	how do i get it to go away?
<xyzaffa1r>	i even trien killall -u root
<tomty89>	!wtf grub-mount
<phrik>	tomty89: core/grub
<tomty89>	hmm
<xyzaffa1r>	but there it still is taking 50% of my cpu
<xyzaffa1r>	tomty89, what?
<tomty89>	oh don't mind me
<xyzaffa1r>	oh ok.
<xyzaffa1r>	well.
<xyzaffa1r>	i can't restart
<xyzaffa1r>	as grub is not in a good state :)
<xyzaffa1r>	i hate grub.
<xyzaffa1r>	so much.
<tomty89>	write your grub.cfg
<halfwit>	write something better
<xyzaffa1r>	halfwit, i don't program, thanks for the tip though...
<xyzaffa1r>	tomty89, what?
<halfwit>	when you incessantly bitch about a problem, without ability to bring about a solution, you're really just doing nothing.
<halfwit>	that's all
<mvdw>	i thought this was #archlinux not #shotsfired.
<halfwit>	/join #shotsfired
<xyzaffa1r>	halfwit, unless you have something helpfull to say, please just leave me alone right now.
<tomty89>	xyzaffa1r: http://ix.io/ik5
<mvdw>	there's useful commands like /ignore
<reisio>	yo' fly is down
<xyzaffa1r>	mvdw, thank you.
<xyzaffa1r>	tomty89, what is that?
<tomty89>	my grub.cfg
<xyzaffa1r>	if i just uninstall os-prober it works.
<xyzaffa1r>	but i have a windows install :(
<xyzaffa1r>	tomty89. am i to use that as a refrence for making my own?
<xyzaffa1r>	oh man
<tomty89>	well just to show you that grub-mkconfig is meh
<xyzaffa1r>	grub-mount sudenylu stopped.
<xyzaffa1r>	i will try once more to mkconfig
<xyzaffa1r>	it always freezes on: found fallback initramfs image: /boot/initramfs-linux-fallback.img for a while
<xyzaffa1r>	is that normal?
<fogobogo>	does it boot or not?
<xyzaffa1r>	fogobogo, is that directed towards me?
<fogobogo>	yes
<xyzaffa1r>	i don't know yet, haven't rebooted.
<xyzaffa1r>	i know for sure it won't right now
<xyzaffa1r>	but
<halfwit>	i had that when i had video card issues. heh.h
<xyzaffa1r>	do ipods work with arch?
<xyzaffa1r>	damn, i have been frozen on: found fallback initramfs image: /boot/initramfs-linux-fallback.img for minutes now
<fogobogo>	xyzaffa1r: the wont boot arch if thats what you mean. but there is stuff for syncing and stuff with an arch box
<fogobogo>	xyzaffa1r: delete it?
<xyzaffa1r>	delete what?
<fogobogo>	that file
<xyzaffa1r>	oh.
<xyzaffa1r>	figured it might be important
<xyzaffa1r>	no idea what it is
<fogobogo>	will get installed on your next kernel install anyway
<fogobogo>	and no, usually not important
<fogobogo>	never used it once
<tomty89>	i think it actually freeze on things after that
<xyzaffa1r>	yep
<xyzaffa1r>	/boot/initramfs-linux.img
<xyzaffa1r>	frozen on that
<xyzaffa1r>	can i delete that too?
<fogobogo>	that you really shouldnt delete
<sheep>	you need that to boot
<fogobogo>	indeed
<tomty89>	no, it clearly shows that it's not the problem of them
<tomty89>	but what goes on after them
<xyzaffa1r>	ok then
<crazedpsyc>	hum, shouldn't pulseaudio switch from speakers to headphones when headphones are plugged in (and vice versa) by default?
<crazedpsyc>	shouldn't as in doesn't it normally
<halfwit>	at least grub has a verbose mode
<fogobogo>	me alsa sure does
<xyzaffa1r>	crazedpsyc, it should.
<fogobogo>	crazedpsyc: quite a cock block when browsing porn i imagine
<bougyman>	alsa doesn't do any automagic like that unless you have dmix configured for it.
<tomty89>	it's just about the card/driver in alsa
<fogobogo>	nah, switching from speaker to headphone jack is some other automagic
<fogobogo>	dmix is just software mixing
<bougyman>	you can make a dmix that outputs to multiple sources.
<crazedpsyc>	hrm. this is weird
<crazedpsyc>	with alsa i have to flip the automute switch in alsamixer of course, but this isn't even that behaviour
<crazedpsyc>	it doesn't play out headphones at all unless i switch manually
<fogobogo>	bougyman: you can do an awful lot with alsa... just noone managed yet
<tomty89>	you need some module for it i think
<tomty89>	if it exist
<tomty89>	s/it/that/
<xyzaffa1r>	i tried to add a background to the grub screen and now i don't even have a working grub :(
<anonyg00se>	does anyone know how i can make xboxdrv not act like a mouse by default? it's absolutely fucking retarded
<bougyman>	xyzaffa1r: this proves the old adage: bling = bug
<anonyg00se>	this hasn't happened before but now xpad and xboxdrv both act like a mouse
<xyzaffa1r>	bougyman, what?
<xyzaffa1r>	bougyman, oh.
<xyzaffa1r>	bougyman, the problem is i tried to use grub-customizer and that broke everything.
<xyzaffa1r>	bougyman, next time i will be not lazy and just do it my self
<xyzaffa1r>	it's done, i am going to reboot then cry when it is broken still.
<xyzaffa1r>	will report back
<crazedpsyc>	um. i am dumb.
<crazedpsyc>	i unmuted the headphone channel in alsamixer
<halfwit>	anyways
<bougyman>	ahahah
<crazedpsyc>	forgot those still controlled it, even when playing with pulse
<bougyman>	alsa is underneath pulse
<tomty89>	i wonder how it is presented in pulse? two sinks? or two profiles?
<moscownights>	eve
<tomty89>	or one sink/profile
<crazedpsyc>	for headphone vs speaker? it has a "port" selection in the outputs in pavucontrol
<halfwit>	efternoon
<tomty89>	crazedpsyc: does change it alsamixer cause change in port as well?
<tomty89>	*in
<crazedpsyc>	changing what, the volume?
<tomty89>	crazedpsyc: well whatever change your output through headphone/speaker
<tomty89>	i mean whatever cause the "switch"
<xyzaffa1r>	for what ever reason it didn't add entries for my other operating systems, just this install.
<xyzaffa1r>	os-prober is installed.
<crazedpsyc>	oh, no
<crazedpsyc>	plugging in headphones also doesn't change the port in pulse, it just auto-mutes in alsa
<crazedpsyc>	it stays on the speaker port
<tomty89>	hmm
<xyzaffa1r>	is there another boot loader that will give me the option between arch and ubuntu that doesn't take a lot of configuration?
<xyzaffa1r>	*arch and windows
<tomty89>	actually even a windows entry is short to write
<crazedpsyc>	do you have the option to use efi?
<hyo0301>	i got something
<xyzaffa1r>	crzedpsyc, i refuse that only ever made things more complicated for me.
<xyzaffa1r>	tomty89, awwww
<xyzaffa1r>	tomty89, i don't like the sound of that, sounds like you are going to make me do hard things :(
<crazedpsyc>	oh.
<crazedpsyc>	that's where you are.
<crazedpsyc>	a windows entry for grub is a few lines of text
<xyzaffa1r>	crazedpsyc, what?
<tomty89>	*shrug*
<crazedpsyc>	which happen to live on the wiki, i believe
<crazedpsyc>	not that hard
<tomty89>	the wiki ones are actually tainted with garbage params already
<crazedpsyc>	ah
<xyzaffa1r>	tomty89. what do i do if the wiki is borked?
<crazedpsyc>	just needs a root and chainloader, no?
<tomty89>	well i mean, it probably still works, just something unnecessary is included
<tomty89>	grub-mkconfig-ish
<xyzaffa1r>	tomty89, fudge is.
<crazedpsyc>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/grub#windows_xp_menu_entry <-- pretty simple one, though not sure why it specifically says xp
<phrik>	title: grub - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<tomty89>	that's the old way already
<crazedpsyc>	ah
<tomty89>	down there are the new way
<crazedpsyc>	i haven't used grub in a while
<tomty89>	like chainload the efi or `ntldr`
<tomty89>	`ntldr` as in grub command
<xyzaffa1r>	should i just switch on uefi and use gummi?
<hyo0301>	guys
<hyo0301>	i can hear buzzing now
<tomty89>	xyzaffa1r: it's all up to you
<tomty89>	xyzaffa1r: but to use gummiboot, /boot has to be on the esp
<tomty89>	xyzaffa1r: grub can be use for uefi as well, btw
<xyzaffa1r>	tomty89, but i hate grub, also,  no idea what esp is.
<xyzaffa1r>	sounds confusing
<xyzaffa1r>	tomty89, how do i just make the windows entry?
<crazedpsyc>	don't be so afraid
<crazedpsyc>	you can read things
<xyzaffa1r>	crazedpsyc, i am pretty stressed out right now, if i read through things i am going to freak out.
<tomty89>	xyzaffa1r: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/grub#windows_installed_in_bios-mbr_mode well
<phrik>	title: grub - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<crazedpsyc>	perhaps you should take a break then?
<tomty89>	i never tested that myself though
<crazedpsyc>	stress is not going to help you do this well
<xyzaffa1r>	crazedpsyc, it's unrelated to this situation.
<halfwit>	arch is definitely not for you
<hyo0301>	tomty89:  00 isnt muted??!
<xyzaffa1r>	i thought i ignored that guy?
<mvdw>	00 is not muted, mm is.
<bougyman>	mm is muted
<tomty89>	^
<xyzaffa1r>	ignore halfwit chan
<xyzaffa1r>	oops
<mvdw>	:d
<halfwit>	stop
<tomty89>	...

<tomty89>	well that's the problem
<tomty89>	but i don't know the cause
<hyo0301>	what's the problem?
<tomty89>	the user doesn't have acl permission to the sound devices
<solitarycipher>	hey. so this is not an arch-specific question, and it is really a matter of opinion. i want to put my .bash_history/.zsh_history/.viminfo in an alternate place. would .local/share/ be a good place? or maybe .cache or .config?
<solitarycipher>	i mean, i think it fits in .local/share.
<tomty89>	hyo0301: otherwise you would see something like user:tom:rw- for each devices in the output
<tomty89>	hyo0301: and when ls -l /dev/snd, you'll see a + sign at the end of each item on the permission column
<tomty89>	hyo0301: http://ix.io/irb

<hyo0301>	oh lawd
<tomty89>	but i don't know what  you have done, or what govern the setting of these acl thing
<tomty89>	hyo0301: some google result might tell you that you need to be in the audio group, but shouldn't be necessary, at least in nowadays arch
<tomty89>	hyo0301: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2166214 and in this, it suggested that it might be a pam thing
<phrik>	title: [solved] no sound. sound indicator shows me only "dummy (at ubuntuforums.org)
<ausseh>	when i do: gummiboot --path=/mnt/boot install - i get this error: not booted with efi, skipping efi variable setup.

<hyo0301>	tomty89: the guy says "alsa-base.conf"
<hyo0301>	i don't have that file
<tomty89>	hyo0301: ignore that
<tomty89>	hyo0301: the only point is the last post
<tomty89>	hyo0301: but that might or might not be your case after all
<sheep>	ausseh: you'll need to boot to your system setup menu and add the entry for gummiboot manually, or load it from the uefi shell then retry from inside linux
<hyo0301>	sudo pam-auth-update --force is that supposed to work for arch users?
<tomty89>	hyo0301: the alsa-base.conf might only mean something if you even see no devices with sudo
<sheep>	hyo0301: there's no package in the repos that provides that
<hyo0301>	sheep: yeah i looked, i saw this thread like 3 hours ago

<tomty89>	hyo0301: my point is, you can use that workaround, but if you just ignore the actual problem, you'll still suffer one day, who knows if you'll repeat whatever caused it even with a reinstallation :p
<gehidore>	the evil reinstallation
<ausseh>	okay, explain this one... booting with uefi, i get no commands? not even shutdown?

<ausseh>	sheep: what was your theory again? boot into shell then try installing gummiboot?
<hyo0301>	what was the command tomty89 ? grep /dev/snd*"?

<tomty89>	/*
<ausseh>	'lsblk' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or batch file.

<sheep>	so cd efi\gummiboot
<ausseh>	okay, i'm in
<sheep>	then ls, and then type in whatever .efi file shows up
<sheep>	that should load gummiboot
<ausseh>	it's just going to reboot into firmware interface
<ausseh>	had a countdown
<sheep>	what the
<ausseh>	and took me back to my utility
<sheep>	wait, did you make the loader.conf for gummiboot and make an entry for arch in that?
<ausseh>	i don't think so... :|
<sheep>	that's probably why. the uefi shell probably has 'edit' or some really simple text editor to make those
<ausseh>	okay, i'm at a menu... not blue arch.
<sheep>	the wiki should have examples of what to put in the config
<ausseh>	arch linux archiso x86_64 uefi usb
<ausseh>	uefi shell v1 and v2
<ausseh>	efi default loader
<ausseh>	and reboot into firmware interface
<sheep>	pick the first option for now.  if that works you can just reinstall gummiboot and set up the config files in the mounted system
<ausseh>	i have no commands -_-
<tomty89>	pick arch linux archiso x86_64 uefi usb
<tomty89>	did you?
<ausseh>	trying to mount /dev/disk/by-label/arch-201505' to 'run/archiso/bootmnt'
<ausseh>	and can't access tty; job control turned off
<tomty89>	hmm
<tomty89>	maybe the archiso initramfs doesn't support your usb controller?
<ausseh>	i'm at [rootfs /]# with no commands for lsblk or fdisk -l
<tomty89>	but well you booted in legacy mode...
<tomty89>	nvm
<ausseh>	i'm booting uefi now
<ausseh>	installed as efi
<tomty89>	but your boot failed :(
<ausseh>	booting live cd
<tomty89>	you're still in early user space
<ausseh>	do any commands work in rootfs?
<diegoviola>	i have a bunch of pictures in a directory, is there a way i can find the duplicated pictures based on the content and remove them?
<earnestly>	diegoviola: md5sum
<tigrmesh>	sha1
<earnestly>	you could use an associate array with the checksum as the key and filename as value.  gather the list, move it to another directory, anything left behind will be duplicates
<tomty89>	sha512
<tigrmesh>	earnestly, i would not have thought of that.  thanks  :)
<diegoviola>	earnestly: interesting
<earnestly>	tigrmesh: it should work, but you know, it might not be good.  there might be tools which automatically do this better
<earnestly>	and calculating checksums for lots of files will be slow.  you could probably even use crc32 or something
<earnestly>	which is just `sum`
<tigrmesh>	probably.  people who take pictures tend to be pretty focussed on keeping track of them
<earnestly>	unless you do a giant merge from 1970s to now from an old machine ._.
<diegoviola>	sorry for being slow, i still can't see how i can do this with md5sum
<earnestly>	136m .
<earnestly>	teapot earnest %i ~/docs/pict/gif time sum * > /dev/null
<earnestly>	sum * > /dev/null  0.34s user 0.01s system 98% cpu 0.361 total
<earnestly>	it's not too bad, but first run took about 4 seconds
<earnestly>	diegoviola: associative arrays in bash are sets
<tomty89>	earnestly: the checksums will be cached?
<earnestly>	diegoviola: e.g. if you do something like this: foo["$filename"]="$hash"
<earnestly>	by virtue of being a set, it will not store duplicates.  that is, if two filenames map to the same hash, only one filename will remain
<earnestly>	in the set
<diegoviola>	earnestly: oh that makes sense, thanks :-)
<earnestly>	diegoviola: declare -a set; while read -r hash _ filename; do set["$filename"]="$hash"; done < sum /path/to/picts/*
<earnestly>	hm
<earnestly>	done < <(sum ...)
<trodis>	hi, i have 2 wlan router both act as a ap, i want to serve 10 wlan clients, but one ap is not enough because wlan is share medium as we all know. but when i merge 2 ap to 1 single wlan, do the client pick automatically the ap which gives has more ressource
<trodis>	the whole point is about ressource management not about range extending
<nemesys>	did the latest install of libre office add a bitcoin mining malware....?
<nemesys>	seeing all of these adds for coin-or-mp, coin-or-cgl
<earnestly>	hmm
<diegoviola>	earnestly: ty
<earnestly>	diegoviola: well that won't... hmm
<nemesys>	coin-or-coinutils....
<seylerius>	nemesys: it's a graphics toolkit
<tomty89>	bitcoin mining malware which earns you money? :d
<nemesys>	seylerius, thanks
<earnestly>	diegoviola: there may be more to this
<jeromelanteri>	i try to install and config qemu with kvm. so i follow wikis around that and have some questions: when check kernel module for virtualization ability, does kvm_* could be on "m" or does they have to be on "y" ?
<earnestly>	diegoviola: oh
<jeromelanteri>	same question for virtio module kernel
<diegoviola>	earnestly: i was thinking about hashes being random with md5sum, hence my confusion... i wonder what i was thinking >.<
<jaood>	jeromelanteri: for your desktop having it as module would be more appropiate
<diegoviola>	being random for the same filenames
<jeromelanteri>	also, for virtio driver for windows guest, on the repos, there is one named virtio-win, but impossible to download this. is there an other way to have it and instal this virtio-win driver
<jeromelanteri>	jaood: so "m" is better than "y"
<ausseh>	okay, i may be getting somewhere... /boot is not a fat efi system partition
<ausseh>	assuming it has to be?
<jeromelanteri>	ausseh: on my system, it is a /boot fat efi system partition files
<earnestly>	diegoviola: http://ix.io/irl/sh
<earnestly>	tigrmesh: ^ as well, if you were interested
<earnestly>	this is why i like linux so much, i cried literally when using windows and couldn't find a nice deduplication tool
<diegoviola>	earnestly: cool, thanks :-)
<ausseh>	removed gummiboot to start it over... pacman -s gummiboot returns database file for 'core' 'extra' 'community' does not exist...
<earnestly>	ausseh: the sync databases don't exist on the live iso, you have to create them with -sy.  but that begs the question.  why are you installing gummiboot on the iso instead of your newly prepared /?
<ausseh>	i can't boot my system
<ausseh>	not on the ssd

<jeromelanteri>	when try "yaourt -syu virtio-win" at soucre récupération time (after said "yes" to compil), it tell me: "the requested url returned error: 404 not found"
<jeromelanteri>	so looks like aur package is not disponible on server file. what i can do ?
<earnestly>	give up
<earnestly>	also, fuck time
<earnestly>	and the passing of it
<jeromelanteri>	so i can try later ? or is it possible to change the url of the aur server file ?
<diegoviola>	time, does it even exist? :d
<jeromelanteri>	(i not remember where)
<jeromelanteri>	i see this: "https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/virtio-win/" can i install from this link ? and how to do that ?

<phrik>	the trasheap of arch. dig around enough and you might just find some gold. https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/aur
<jeromelanteri>	also the iso source file is 257 octets ... is it normal ?
<nemesys>	xtermcontrol, sheer gold from the aur
<jeromelanteri>	thanks crazedpsyc.
<charlesatum>	anyone here know about astah?
<charlesatum>	i will have to use it for my object-oriented analysis class.
<s00pcan>	changing font size of a running urxvtc window is easy right?
<jeromelanteri>	i think the virtio-win driver (who are not packages in fact) are wrong on the aur link
<jeromelanteri>	here is a link with latest drivers for windows gust on qemu/kvm: https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/archive-virtio/virtio-win-0.1.103-2/
<phrik>	title: fedora people - fedorapeople.org (at fedorapeople.org)
<jeromelanteri>	they are some iso files
<d_garbage>	jeromelanteri, yes. read the file "deprecated-readme" and see the comments for the package https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/virtio-win/
<phrik>	title: aur (en) - virtio-win (at aur.archlinux.org)
<s00pcan>	ok, urxvt-font-size-git works
<d_garbage>	also remember that the aur is a totally unsupported annex to arch and anything can be in there from great stuff to absolute rubbish
<d_garbage>	use at your own risk™
<jeromelanteri>	yes sure... and if i follow the link from comment on fedora repo, there is nothing more. the link i give here are the latest iso image.
<jeromelanteri>	yes sure, i will use and know it is risked. but if i not use it, what i can do more ? nothing... so... i will try and will tell you if it is ok.
<d_garbage>	jeromelanteri, there is a readme file which explains that, yes
<d_garbage>	jeromelanteri, i've no idea if it's ok or not but yeah you have the new location so you might be able to fix the pkgbuild
<jeromelanteri>	i first try if works, after, i will ask you if i well understand how to fix by wiki (sometimes, you think you understand, but people links who really know is the best way to be sure you really understand)
<jeromelanteri>	so... i will be back
<dacoit>	so long
<s00pcan>	slow performance when drawing glyphs.  some programs like alsamixer and xprop do not perform well with some graphics drivers and in consequence redraw very slowly.
<d_garbage>	jeromelanteri, the thing about using the aur is the first time you have to learn an awful lot about the build system to do it properly
<s00pcan>	i need excuses to revist pages i've already read so that i find instant solutions to my other problems
<ausseh>	is there an alternative to gummiboot?
<dacoit>	grub
<sheep>	grub, refind, or just have uefi load the kernel directly
<s00pcan>	refind
<jeromelanteri>	ausseh: grub
<d_garbage>	!give ausseh wiki bootloaders
<phrik>	ausseh: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/boot_loaders
<ausseh>	i need something else....
<s00pcan>	ok we need exotic bootloads
<dacoit>	lol, something new?
<ausseh>	grub is for uefi?
<sheep>	yes
<dacoit>	sure
<sheep>	it also supports bios
<jeromelanteri>	for me, grub seems really easier to understand. b ut it is subjective way of thinking.
<ausseh>	how do i install it?
<dacoit>	wiki
<d_garbage>	ausseh, make some effort than ask again
<d_garbage>	then*
<ausseh>	touche
<d_garbage>	:)
<s00pcan>	refind installs with one command to esp, (may have to copy drivers there), then has auto-detect for most os as default.  gdisk makes an efi partition first.
<jeromelanteri>	ausseh: "yaourt -syu grub" and learn a little bit how to config file
<dacoit>	or you know, pacman
<sheep>	jeromelanteri: we use pacman here

<ausseh>	i'm having issues with "warning: database file for 'core' does not exist

<sheep>	what the heck
<s00pcan>	:)
<holomorph>	!han
<phrik>	http://i.imgur.com/zxl58pv.jpg
<jeromelanteri>	are you from live distro ?
<sheep>	pacman -ss grub should find it
<ausseh>	i've installed the system... :|
<ausseh>	i'm on the live distro
<ausseh>	usb right now
<sheep>	did you chroot?
<ausseh>	>:|
<ausseh>	derp
<s00pcan>	what are we doing
<jeromelanteri>	your system is installed, but you are not mounted it and link it. so your command is look lioke from your live system, and not this one installed i think.
<d_garbage>	installing the system, trying to use gumiboot, failing, at a guess
<dacoit>	not necessarily in that order either
<ausseh>	failing, indeed. i had booted via legacy (system config was set to windows uefi, changed to other os)
<s00pcan>	just use the usb disk as a bootloader and then load the internal drive, worry about it next week
<d_garbage>	!grab s00pcan
<phrik>	d_garbage: tada!
<d_garbage>	now that's some next-level advice, right there
<d_garbage>	have to remember that one for the 50 people a day who drone on for 10 pages each about borked uefi
<jeromelanteri>	ausseh from your bios, you need to have a boot on your /boot partition (fat filestystem efi) and see it on the list bootable bios. it need to be first or after cdrom.
<d_garbage>	now we just need something similar for hybrid graphic, hibernate/suspend and wireless :)
<d_garbage>	and we're good - party time!
<s00pcan>	so i just urxvt*skipbuiltinglyphs:    true and i can use alsamixer again?  no more xterm? cool
<jeromelanteri>	if you not see this named (for me it is "grub_boot") in the list, so there is not.
<dacoit>	phrik: han2 is https://i.imgur.com/issngzr.gif
<phrik>	dacoit: tada!
<earnestly>	holomorph: make a flycheck plugin for ponyc, --pass=expr
<jeromelanteri>	assueh: also, when change a option (depend of matriel), for see some other stuff, you have to reboot again the bios. (like uefi mode vs old bios mode boot)
<earnestly>	holomorph: added one for syntastic, see comments for current broken assumptions
<jeromelanteri>	ausseh: and then, you will se in the bios some other options / list apears.
<s00pcan>	d_garbage: hibernate,suspend,wireless.... complicated enough without mentioning graphics
<holomorph>	earnestly: :o i see
<jeromelanteri>	ausseh: do you have first this named gumiboot partition show in the bios list ?
<d_garbage>	s00pcan, they're kind of the top questions
<d_garbage>	like most of all problems coming through here are one of those
<s00pcan>	lets see, hibernation doesn't work, suspend i have a button for on my macbook air but it wakes up easily and unpredictably, wireless i gave up on and moved my desktop and everything to one spot, but i have working wifi on my laptop
<s00pcan>	so i'm 0.6/3 for a score on those
<d_garbage>	hah
<ausseh>	i gave up on gummiboot and now am moving to grub
<ausseh>	$esp = /mnt/boot
<ausseh>	?
<krav>	aw...but gummiboot is easy
<ausseh>	not easy if you've booted in legacy and installation requires uefi, however uefi doesn't boot like legacy does. sends me to a cmd prompt where no commands work - not even shutdown.
<krav>	yeah. you have to boot in uefi
<krav>	or installing is pretty hard if not impossible
<holomorph>	earnestly: you do it :p it's actually really easy

<ausseh>	error: failed to get canonical path of /mnt/boot
<s00pcan>	i want to use dtach and reparent an instance of elinks without restarting it, then load that in a new tmux session
<s00pcan>	so is the reparent thing possible
<ausseh>	way to check what $esp is?
<ausseh>	echo?
<ausseh>	echo $esp isn't a functional command
<dacoit>	s00pcan: theres reptyr but its hacky
<s00pcan>	making background jobs just go straight to this would be interesting
<ausseh>	how do i find $esp?
<reisio>	wat?

<earnestly>	holomorph: nah, too many caveats

<earnestly>	holomorph: the syntactic one isn't even very reliable
<holomorph>	will have to wait, then, i suppose
<earnestly>	yeah
<earnestly>	holomorph: but i can at least use it personally
<holomorph>	earnestly: yup

<s00pcan>	so you're saying they are configured there, and not elsewhere, such as in some systemd thing?
<d_garbage>	think things get mounted by systemd units these days, the units (can) be made from fstab
<d_garbage>	but you'd remember writing a systemd unit wouldn't you?
<maquis>	!sprunge
<phrik>	pipe or redirect your command or file into `curl -f 'sprunge=<-' sprunge.us`. this will upload to sprunge.us and return a link to the paste.
<dacoit>	systemd will make an mount unit if you dont have noauto in fstab iirc
<d_garbage>	there was some annoying bug with mounting fairly recently iirc
<d_garbage>	like you'd mount something and systemd would immediately un-mount it again, people were quite exasperated :p
<maquis>	anyone interested in helping with an x issue? i'm still debugging an issue with attempts to start x causing the virtual terminal to break (bouncing back and forth horizontally). this happens both with the default xinitrc (doesn't seem to use a window manager?) which starts successfully, and when i try unsuccessfully to start evilwm. xorg.0.log is at http://sprunge.us/nakx

<ausseh>	i used a mac, right clicked and clicked burn to disk. i get "reboot and select proper boot device"
<scimmia>	ausseh, all of the info is in the wiki
<d_garbage>	maquis, ah, still having that flickering console problem?
<ausseh>	i can't seem to find that part. :|
<scimmia>	ausseh, hmm, looks like they cover usb pretty well, but not burning. the key is that the program needs to burn the image as-is with absolutely no modification
<polyzen>	i keep getting "pkg/python-dateutil/pkgbuild: line 20: ./updatezinfo.py: permission denied" while trying to build said package
<polyzen>	version 2.4.2 of it
<ausseh>	i'm just trying to get into arch uefi so i can edit the grub -_-
<ausseh>	i can't make it very far -_-
<ausseh>	it doesn't come up with an arch splash screen
<ausseh>	only a 5 choice menu
<scimmia>	yep, that sounds right
<ausseh>	then goes to error: '/dev/disk/by-label/arch_201505' device did not show up after 30 seconds...
<scimmia>	ah, yeah, that. i've seen people on the forum mention that error, but never payed much attention to it
<ausseh>	it's sad... can't get around it in any fashion or form. i've been attempting to install this for a very sad 7 hours.
<ausseh>	should have went with legacy
<ausseh>	reinstall?
<maquis>	d_garbage: yes
<maquis>	d_garbage: it seems as though x is changing the screen resolution of the console when it starts?  not sure how that could happen, though.
<maquis>	or how to prevent it :)
<d_garbage>	could it be some kms thing?
<maquis>	!kms
<maquis>	d_garbage: what is kms?
<d_garbage>	try boot with the nomodeset kernel command line parameter
<dacoit>	!wiki kms
<phrik>	dacoit: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/kernel_mode_setting
<maquis>	d_garbage: do i just add that to the grub conf?
<d_garbage>	i don't know much about it. i use nvidia so apart from huge text in tty it al works ok
<d_garbage>	maquis, you could just try it from the bootloader, add it at boot time (usually press 'e' to edit)
<polyzen>	final fuckingly
<maquis>	d_garbage: i'm going to try that.
<polyzen>	had to use python3 updateblahblah.py
<polyzen>	as opposed to ./updatepoiweqf.py
<d_garbage>	maquis, why not it's easy. and non persistent. if it messes up or anything just reboot
<maquis>	d_garbage: figuring it out now. :)
<d_garbage>	maquis, just get edit mode on whatever bootloader you use (e for grub at least) then add nomodeset on the end of the line that has the kernel in it and continue boot (b)
<dacoit>	ctrl+x or f10 sometimes
<d_garbage>	not saying it will help at all but it's just something to try
<polyzen>	jelle, for python-dateutil, i had to switch "./updatezinfo.py" with "python3 updatezinfo.py"
<maquis>	d_garbage: weird. maybe i did it wrong. now x is getting a fatal error and isn't finding any screens.
<ausseh>	is there a way to revert my uefi install back to legacy or is it reinstall time?
<d_garbage>	maquis, oh dunno then. it does say that for some drivers you can't disable kms any  more, maybe that's the one you use?
<maquis>	d_garbage: could be. it's the intel driver. :)
<maquis>	d_garbage: thanks for the suggestions, though! :)
<d_garbage>	dunno, i tried googling around for a while, out of interest but it's a hard one to pin down
<maquis>	d_garbage: yeah. i've been googling a bit too. getting frustrated with this laptop... and i've only had it since yesterday!
<polyzen>	jelle, the executable bit was removed upstream. it didn't want to work even if i set it manually, anyhow
<ausseh>	is there a way to revert my uefi install back to legacy or is it reinstall time?
<d_garbage>	on the bright side, if it's just the tty's that are buggered up that's not the end of the world
<maquis>	d_garbage: yeah. except i'm trying to debug my preferred window manager, and i have to reboot with every attempt. but yes, i can at least get fvwm to work correctly, so that's a good thing. :)
<d_garbage>	maquis, only other wild guess i can think of is does changing the framebuffer  resolution affect anything?
<scimmia>	ausseh, the only difference between a uefi installation and a bios installation is the bootloader
<ausseh>	that is all?????????
<scimmia>	yep
<sheep>	scimmia: well no
<d_garbage>	maquis, you don't need to reboot to change window managers?
<scimmia>	sheep, did i forget something?
<sheep>	the difference is the interface used by the firmware to load the operating system
<maquis>	d_garbage: i found a site that is suggesting that. it said the use hwinfo --framebuffer to find out what the correct framebuffer mode for my resolution... and that is returning nothing.
<scimmia>	sheep, ...which would be the bootloader
<dacoit>	on a lot of macs there is huge difference between efi mode and csm/legacy
<sheep>	scimmia: no....
<maquis>	d_garbage: i started a long time ago with linux (although i've been out of the loop for a few years). i'm in the habit of booting to the terminal and then using startx when i want a gui.
<sheep>	scimmia: the firmware loads the bootloader from the disk
<d_garbage>	maquis, so blind type it? :)
<s00pcan>	maquis: i remember that
<maquis>	:)
<maquis>	d_garbage: not quite that old :)
<sheep>	scimmia: the firmware is not the bootloader
<s00pcan>	desktop/laptop boot straight to x11 xmonad urxvt terminal on my main monitor now
<ausseh>	so do i need to reinstall in order to switch?
<sheep>	(with the efistub kernel, the kernel is.  otherwise, it's gummiboot, grub, or whatever)
<d_garbage>	i mean you don't have to have a usable terminal to login and type 'startx'
<scimmia>	sheep, i wasn't talking about the firmware, i was talking about the os installation. there is no difference outside the bootloader
<sheep>	scimmia: you also have to use gpt for uefi and have an efi system partition, which isn't needed for bios
<scimmia>	ausseh, just reconfigure your bootloader and you'll be fine
<dacoit>	theres a huge difference for some computers.
<d_garbage>	also some window managers you can change with <wm> --replace
<scimmia>	sheep, which is irrelevant to the current discussion
<maquis>	d_garbage: i'm betting that evilwm doesn't support that :)
<ausseh>	how do i change the bootloader to something that is purely legacy? i'm tired of getting the message about efi variables.
<ausseh>	and i do have that efi partition... what happens to it?
<ausseh>	that is /mnt/boot
<sheep>	grub-install --target=i386-pc
<sheep>	assuming you want grub, which i hate, but that would do it
<ausseh>	i tried to go to grub... it whined about the efi variables
<sheep>	right, but you tried grub in efi mode
<dacoit>	--target=i386-p
<ausseh>	i want something that will boot ._.
<dacoit>	c
<sheep>	not bios mode.
<lonewulf`>	sounds like somone needs to do a: pacman -s efivars
<sheep>	lonewulf`: no.
<dacoit>	not for this
<sheep>	lonewulf`: he's not booted into uefi mode
<lonewulf`>	sheep: kk roger that
<lonewulf`>	dacoit: got it.
<sheep>	ausseh: did you try editing the boot entries from the uefi bios setup menu?
<ausseh>	boot entries???
<sheep>	yes, the system boot entries
<sheep>	there should be a menu somewhere to let you pick a file off of the efi system partition to boot
<ausseh>	you're losing me.. i made it where it's either uefi or legacy
<sheep>	what model laptop or motherboard do you have?
<ausseh>	sabertooth 990fx r2.0
<sheep>	let me look up what's in its menu
<sheep>	enter delete on startup to open the bios setup menu
<ausseh>	i did that
<ausseh>	i'm in "advanced mode"
<sheep>	go to the "boot" menu
<ausseh>	done
<sheep>	i'm trying to navigate this stupid manual
<sheep>	is there some sort of option there to add a new entry?
<ausseh>	hard drive priorities... boot option priorities
<ausseh>	that is all
<sheep>	may be under "boot option priorities"
<ausseh>	nothing
<ausseh>	just shows my list of bootable drives
<sheep>	hmm.  that's weird.  it should have some sort of menu for inserting a custom entry somewhere
<d_garbage>	does it even support uefi?
<ausseh>	it does
<d_garbage>	sure?
<ausseh>	uefi, as well as legacy
<ausseh>	i'm booting uefi right now
<ausseh>	i just get errors
<d_garbage>	when trying to use the arch iso on my machine, it things the mobo has uefi but actually it doesn't
<sheep>	didn't you say you tried to install grub?
<ausseh>	i tried
<ausseh>	it said something about needing efi vars
<sheep>	did you ever do grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg ?
<d_garbage>	in the end i gave up and used an opensuse live image instead
<ausseh>	i didn't
<d_garbage>	quite a nice kde live desktop with persistent settings }:]
<sheep>	darn.  if you had, then i'd suggest opening grub from the uefi shell
<sheep>	d_garbage: uefi support for iso images is notoriously inconsistent
<d_garbage>	yeah
<d_garbage>	whatever people say about how good uefi is, it certainly seems to have been a nightmare since it came along, at least for linux
<d_garbage>	!uefi3
<phrik>	universally effective at fucking-up installs
<ausseh>	i'll agree -_-
<sheep>	ausseh: what /dev node is being used for root?  you might be able to load the kernel and initramfs directly from uefi so you can boot the installed system in uefi mode and run grub-install or gimmiboot or whatever correctly
<ausseh>	/dev node????????
<sheep>	d_garbage: it's all because the uefi forum chickened out and didn't make a standard for booting from iso media
<sheep>	ausseh: like /dev/sda5
<d_garbage>	yeah, 'standards'
<ausseh>	/dev/sda1 is efi
<ausseh>	2 is swap and 3 is root
<ausseh>	i miscalculated earlier. this is 10 hours of nothing but failures.
<sheep>	try this in the uefi shell (this is a total long shot): enter 'fs0:', then enter this: '/vmlinuz-linux root=/dev/sda3 initrd=/initramfs-linux.img'
<sheep>	if that fails, do 'copy /vmlinuz-linux vmlinuz-linux.efi' then do '/vmlinuz-linux.efi root=/dev/sda3 initrd=/initramfs-linux.img'
<ausseh>	not recofnized
<ausseh>	-f+d
<ausseh>	+g even
<sheep>	which command gave you that?
<d_garbage>	!w coreboot
<phrik>	d_garbage: coreboot - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coreboot>
<ausseh>	first one gave me source file not found
<d_garbage>	foss all the things
<sheep>	the 'fs0:' ?
<ausseh>	copy
<sheep>	did you try the other one? fs0: then \vmlinuz-linux root=/dev/sda3 initrd=/initramfs-linux.img
<ausseh>	none are recognized as an internal/external command
<sheep>	what does 'dir' show?
<ausseh>	grub and efi
<sheep>	that's it?
<ausseh>	that's all
<ausseh>	2 dir(s)
<d_garbage>	also if you've been at this for 10 hours straight, maybe give it a rest. your brain it probably tired of the problem
<sudokode>	jesus
<sudokode>	sooo
<sudokode>	today
<d_garbage>	what?
<sudokode>	lol wtf
<sheep>	hmm.  remount the system in bios mode from the livecd, chroot into it, pacman -s linux
<sudokode>	i don't even known
<sudokode>	-
<sudokode>	n
<ausseh>	very true, d_garbage
<d_garbage>	me either
<sheep>	make sure the efi system partition is mounted on (/mnt)/boot before doing pacman -s linux
<sheep>	then try the uefi shell commands again
<d_garbage>	install opensuse and then install arch from existing }:]
<sudokode>	last day of class, i bought a toilet seat, i repaired a jeep xj, i got tased, i got a little drunk, i threw some gas on a bonfire
<sudokode>	lots of shit done today
<sheep>	on a related note, i'm not buying asus motherboards with stock firmware
<d_garbage>	sudokode, got tased by who?
<dacoit>	coppers
<sudokode>	pretty sure you buy most motherboards with stock firmware
<sheep>	d_garbage: the arch iso worked fine in uefi mode for me
<sudokode>	d_garbage: my buddy mike. my other buddy has a stun gun for whatever reason
<sheep>	then again, that was with firmware based on tianocore
<d_garbage>	lol
<sudokode>	so i'm like... sure, fuck it. do it
<sudokode>	shit hurts
<sudokode>	it's not bad though
<sudokode>	he hasn't posted the video yet :d
<d_garbage>	was this before or after the drinking part?
<sudokode>	tonight or in general?
<d_garbage>	lo]
<d_garbage>	lol
<d_garbage>	also gas on bonfire - still have eyebrows?
<ausseh>	what the fucking hell!?!?!?!
<ausseh>	reboot and select proper boot device
<d_garbage>	sell it, buy a mac :p
<ausseh>	i'm on a mac right now >.>
<d_garbage>	hehe
<ausseh>	i don't really like it, tbh
<ausseh>	just how small it is
<dacoit>	man, o brother where art thou is a great movie
<d_garbage>	install problems are the worst because you don't even have a system to play with
<ausseh>	^
<sudokode>	d_garbage: https://scontent-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtf1/v/t1.0-9/11258036_10205856920957482_7065709818129360472_n.jpg?oh=b3395f919ca539ae7d6057305be5b79d&oe=5609f496
<sudokode>	lol that's one i took
<sudokode>	we pulled the carpet and seats out of guy on left's jeep, also featured on left
<d_garbage>	thought the bonfire was a giant pile of weed there for a second :p
<sudokode>	the brush in the front is what we burned :d
<d_garbage>	sounds like quite a good day (not sure about the tasing part)
<sudokode>	eh, it was an experiment
<sudokode>	how often do you get tased?
<sudokode>	i did get to tase mike back though, but he was a pussy about it
<d_garbage>	lol
<sudokode>	until it finally happened and he's like... ohhh it's not that bad
<sudokode>	but anyway
<sudokode>	good day
<d_garbage>	bit like brushing your finger against the live pin of a plug when pulling it out of the socket?
<sudokode>	no, not like that at all
<sudokode>	it's like having a knife shoved in your side for a split second, then you pull away on instinct
<d_garbage>	i remember that from when i was a kid. made my arm vibrate really hard and there was a taste of tin
<sudokode>	and you realize it wasn't really anything
<sudokode>	well, that's just electrocution :d
<d_garbage>	hehe
<sudokode>	this is like setting fire to your flesh on a very localized area
<d_garbage>	fun
<sudokode>	but you pull away so quick and once it makes full contact, it breaks the arc
<sudokode>	so it's like omg pain okay gtfo
<sudokode>	d_garbage: 110v doesn't describe it
<d_garbage>	240 here
<d_garbage>	:)
<sudokode>	heh
<sudokode>	that's a bit worse
<sudokode>	never experienced that
<sudokode>	shit, i got away with only 2 cuts
<sudokode>	that's not bad
<ausseh>	okay, what install tools did you use to put arch on a usb drive?
<threegen>	dd will work
<sudokode>	dd is preferred
<youngwolf>	how to config fonts in arch? i managed to get it right for urxvt and some other applications and text editiors. but the fonts look awful on chromium, especially the bold fonts
<threegen>	i made a multiboot. i'm surprised how little people have them. :)
<ausseh>	it's not working for me... i used it once, used unetbootin
<d_garbage>	i remember once i was drunk at someone's house, they had a tv with big circular speakers on the side of the tv box only one was missing leaving a large hole in the side. i was groping round the side looking for a switch, put my hand right inside the tv, just inches away from the tube. scared the crap out of me when i realised how close that was. probably could have killed me i think
<threegen>	youngwolf install liberation
<threegen>	dgarbage nah, only the tubes rectifieer will kill you. thats not on the back. the back would have just blown everything, and scared you and hurt you. lol.
<threegen>	rectifier, flyback, whatever it's called. :p
<d_garbage>	phew, that's good to know in retrospect anyway - was a very scary moment
<reisio>	they can still kill you, though
<reisio>	snap your back in half
<maquis>	d_garbage: good news: i fixed my preferred window manager! so i don't care about the virtual terminals for now
<d_garbage>	!give maquis grats
<phrik>	maquis: d_garbage sends you congratulations!
<maquis>	d_garbage: thanks for your help!
<maquis>	!thanks
<phrik>	you're welcome, maquis.
<d_garbage>	!thanks2
<phrik>	you're welcome, fleshbag.
<maquis>	lol
<d_garbage>	!phrik
<phrik>	forever broken, but i'm still not your butler.
<sudokode>	d_garbage: lol yeah..
<sudokode>	240v is fuckin scary
<sudokode>	110v is like oh shit why did i touch that
<sudokode>	240v is like... fuckckkcufguckc kkckckccuck
<d_garbage>	zzzzzzzzzzzzzzztttt!
<reisio>	that's why i always carry a friend with a large wooden stick in my pocket
<reisio>	just in case
<sudokode>	lol
<dacoit>	i thought you were just happy to see me
<threegen>	i like the video of the guy getting hit by lightning twice. lol.
<reisio>	heh
<reisio>	threegen: link?
<threegen>	reisio https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mji8axznrx8 :)
<d_garbage>	that's why never have wet hands when you plug something in. i saw a guy do that and found the the plug had a crack in it. he jumped back about 10 feet :p
<threegen>	not to say it's not scary as hell, but he lived, so it's not too bad.
<threegen>	probably had a major headache though. lol.
<reisio>	i feel like if you have time to squat, wouldn't you have time to jump the fuck away?
<threegen>	he probably squatted because his muscles tightened up from the shock.
<reisio>	be worse if the current grabbed him
<reisio>	then he'd be fawwwwkkkeeedd
<reisio>	oh haven't watched it yet
<threegen>	oh gotcha, lol.
<reisio>	they say you should squat if you feel a positive streamer
<threegen>	it kinda looks like he squatted a little though, heh.
<sudokode>	threegen: it's actually terrible
<reisio>	squat on balls of feet, close eyes, hold breath
<reisio>	that way you minimize contact/heat/death
<sudokode>	if you know anything about lightning strikes, which oddly i do
<sudokode>	for the most part, the lightning isn't what kills you
<sudokode>	you usually end up killing yourself
<d_garbage>	it also goes up doesn't it? not down
<sudokode>	no
<sudokode>	well, sometimes
<sudokode>	whichever side has the negative build-up will discharge
<ausseh>	after dd, what comes next to prepare the bootloader? or is it just done?
<d_garbage>	ah
<sudokode>	lightning can be reverse, after all
<dacoit>	its done
<reisio>	imagine if you were carrying a bag of unpopped popping corn
<d_garbage>	ausseh, throw a 'sync' in there, make sure it's finished
<sudokode>	but there's a really high risk of depression and suicide among lightning strike victims
<ausseh>	that's all?
<d_garbage>	really? wow
<reisio>	sudokode: really...
<sudokode>	yeah
<reisio>	i did hear the greater risk is to your eyes/lungs
<d_garbage>	never knew that
<reisio>	over just being the conductor
<ausseh>	sudo dd if=/users/austin/desktop/arch.iso of=/dev/rdisk1s1 && sync
<ausseh>	that work???
<sudokode>	hm
<dacoit>	!g lichtenburg scars
<sudokode>	!g lightning strike scars
<phrik>	dacoit: lichtenberg figure - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lichtenberg_figure>
<reisio>	man, this guy falls hilariously
<phrik>	sudokode: lichtenberg figure - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lichtenberg_figure>
<dacoit>	:d
<d_garbage>	ausseh, make very, very sure it's the right target
<sudokode>	heh
<sudokode>	yeah
<threegen>	ausseh there is no bootloader if you dd'd an iso to a usb.
<sudokode>	that's another thing
<threegen>	ausseh make sure you have a clue to whyat+why you're doing things, not just doing things randomly. random commands dont work...
<threegen>	dd=data destroyer
<d_garbage>	!dd
<phrik>	data disintegrator
<ausseh>	i've used this command with my raspberry pi, prior to finding arch.
<ausseh>	excess flood, lmao
<qubitnerd>	we keep all our sensitive data on raspberry pi's
<d_garbage>	hmm now i'm hungry
<sudokode>	!dd
<phrik>	disk deleter
<qubitnerd>	d_garbage: po
<reisio>	heh
<d_garbage>	i want pie!
<qubitnerd>	pi
<sudokode>	!dd
<phrik>	data duplicator
<ausseh>	don't be hating the pi
<reisio>	the author of gnu dd was in #linux one time
<dacoit>	!dd
<phrik>	data disintegrator
<ausseh>	i love my raspberry pis'
<reisio>	he needed to use dd for something, but had forgotten about it/how to use it
<d_garbage>	not as good as a magnum pi
<qubitnerd>	reisio: i dont believe you
<d_garbage>	i hear elvis was in ##linux once :p
<sudokode>	i sorta believe you
<qubitnerd>	reisio: wait perhaps he did
<reisio>	http://i.imgur.com/t0t4j.jpg
<sudokode>	it's not hard to imagine old time programmers having issues with software
<reisio>	it's not like dd is really that complex
<qubitnerd>	thats a cool tatoo bruh
<qubitnerd>	where'chu get one ?
<d_garbage>	wow i bet the girls *love* that!
<qubitnerd>	get some matching bedsheets
<reisio>	from der lightning
<reisio>	what you really need is the insta-white hair, though
<sudokode>	oh yah?
<reisio>	not all of it, just a smattering
<d_garbage>	not only does it look hella cool, but they'd be all like, "oh, you poor thing..." ;)
<reisio>	preferably in the shape of a genericized lightning bolt
<reisio>	hahah, so true
<sudokode>	the battle scar that keeps on giving
<qubitnerd>	d_garbage: then you can go .."we'll theres one more tatoo down there .. wanna chek it out "
<reisio>	heh
<qubitnerd>	*wink *win
<d_garbage>	i forgot a coffee cup of mine had a metallic finish and put it in the micro. it got marks exactly like that shape
<reisio>	turbocharged wang
<reisio>	d_garbage: weee
<d_garbage>	glows in the dark :p
<reisio>	was always the best thing cds had going for them
<reisio>	metallic or lead? :p
<sudokode>	think that's a misleading question
<reisio>	well one is more likely to poison you than another
<d_garbage>	ruined the cup though. shame it was a present and had a happy dragon on it :(
<reisio>	aw
<sheep>	what kind of coffee mug isn't microwave-safe?
<sudokode>	reisio: is it?
<youngwolf>	can arch be installed on tabs??
<d_garbage>	ones with dragons on apparently
<reisio>	sheep: der electrically conducive oneses?
<sudokode>	pretty sure heavy metal poisoning is about equal amongst heavy metals...
<sheep>	reisio: mu
<sudokode>	hell, you'd die from uranium poisoning before you died from uranium radiation
<reisio>	lot of glass & finishes used on glass has lead in it
<reisio>	mmm, but heavy metal isn't equivalent to metallic :)
<reisio>	stainless steel poisoning? :)
<sudokode>	reisio: lots of glasses used to have uranium in them :p
<d_garbage>	people used to use pewter for plates and mugs, that has lead in. not a great idea
<reisio>	how else can you use your wee to see in the dark
<sudokode>	lighter
<sudokode>	stars
<reisio>	s/people/many dead romans/
<dacoit>	infrared goggles
<sudokode>	moon
<sudokode>	milky way
<d_garbage>	also used in old paints
<reisio>	s/people/current chinese/
<sudokode>	nightvision goggles
<sudokode>	fireflies
<sudokode>	literally anything other than your own piss
<sudokode>	:d
<reisio>	radium ftw
<sudokode>	!grab reconmaster
<dacoit>	lol
<sudokode>	fuck
<ausseh>	okay, dd still isn't done after 10 minutes... what's up?
<sudokode>	!grab reisio
<phrik>	sudokode: tada!
<d_garbage>	slow usb
<ausseh>	o_o
<sheep>	flash write operations can be slow
<d_garbage>	usb can be very slow
<ausseh>	never realized that
<d_garbage>	well the iso is quite big
<sheep>	d_garbage: yeah because of the useless i686 stuff /s
<ausseh>	it's only ~650mb
<d_garbage>	like 1/2 gb
<qubitnerd>	only !
<d_garbage>	yeah :)
<ausseh>	only... winblows is ~3.8gb
<qubitnerd>	ubuntu iso is around 800 mb i think
<sudokode>	10 minutes?
<d_garbage>	i have a fairly fast usb stick and it took about 5 mins
<sudokode>	your flash drive is broken
<sudokode>	it shouldn't take longer than 10 minutes ever
<ausseh>	never been broken before lol
<d_garbage>	!twhs
<phrik>	that's what he said!
<sudokode>	that's usually how flash memory works
<dacoit>	haha
<qubitnerd>	there is a way to find out how much its done
<threegen>	ubuntu is a good...at least 1.3gb.
<dacoit>	siginfo
<sudokode>	threegen: ubuntu comes with firefox
<sudokode>	that's far more than arch can claim
<threegen>	shit, i'll be surprised...it is still about 800mb.
<qubitnerd>	threegen: hmmm 12.04 was around 800 i think .. and the arch iso at that time was 650
<threegen>	seems mint is 1.3gb.
<qubitnerd>	ausseh: does the computer you want to install to already have an existing linux ?
<sudokode>	but then again, when you think about it...
<ausseh>	no, i mean, i've installed arch for the most part... up to putting the bootloader on
<ausseh>	that's all
<sudokode>	arch is one iso... i686 and x86_64, plus can boot from uefi or bios
<qubitnerd>	sudokode: yeah
<qubitnerd>	ausseh:when i first  installed arch i did it from ubuntu and swiped off ubuntu
<d_garbage>	good idea
<qubitnerd>	well mainly because the institute wifi needed a browser to login
<d_garbage>	ouch
<sudokode>	qubitnerd: phone
<d_garbage>	isn't elinks on the cd?
<threegen>	anyone else here use grub on a usb and just upload new iso's to it? :p
<sudokode>	android has gotten better with captive portals
<qubitnerd>	javascripty browser
<d_garbage>	ah
<sudokode>	used to suck if you used an browser other than aosp
<sudokode>	any*
<qubitnerd>	back then i didnt have a smartphone
<d_garbage>	threegen, i've heard of people having multiple install iso's on a usb before
<sudokode>	yeah, those days
<qubitnerd>	another option would have been to ask a friend to bridge ethernet and wifi to my laptop
<d_garbage>	about the only time i wish i had a smart phone is google maps
<sudokode>	when your primary network tester wasn't also your inbox
<d_garbage>	that would be super handy
<threegen>	d_garbage seems to be a lot more info now. when i made mine years ago, i had to hand-write my grub config file. it was pretty painful, took about 10 hours to get it working.
<d_garbage>	grats
<sudokode>	d_garbage: it's not
<sudokode>	it's okay, but i can't say navigation has ever saved my ass
<d_garbage>	i'm terrible at sense of direction, etc
<sudokode>	it usually fucks up in the critical moments
<sudokode>	oh well if you're that lost, stay off the roa
<sudokode>	d
<sudokode>	i don't need to be competing with you
<d_garbage>	i always get lost in fps/open world games
<d_garbage>	usually navigate by the, "oh something's attacking me, can't have been this way before" principle :p
<diegoviola>	do you get lost in life?
<threegen>	lol.
<dacoit>	!8ball
<phrik>	i am not going to even bother with that one.
<d_garbage>	very easily, in both space and time
<supergeek800>	copied from -offtopic:
<supergeek800>	(12:19:09 am) supergeek800: i may have found a more permanent solution to my woes.
<supergeek800>	(12:19:41 am) supergeek800: added the [repo-ck] repo and installed linux-ck for the main kernel.
<supergeek800>	(12:20:50 am) supergeek800: got linux-mainline installed as a secondary kernel from the [miffe] repo in order to try to boot into it on occasion to see if/when my system will finally boot the 4-series kernel and i can use a kernel from the official repos again.
<d_garbage>	?
<d_garbage>	did you come here to spam us with #archlinux-offtopic?
<d_garbage>	how kind
<supergeek800>	no, to say that i stopped running on a kernel that isn't getting updates, decided to try -ck, and it boots and works great, in addition yo being updated/
<d_garbage>	anyway -ck will go to 4 as soon as the patch is fixed, so watch out
<supergeek800>	so too little too late, and i'm right back to running on an updated kernel, unless shit gets repaired/
<supergeek800>	*out-of-date
<d_garbage>	supergeek800, did you try that wireless driver i told you about?
<supergeek800>	d_garbage: r8192 or the other driver? i have a feeling it's the other, so no.
<d_garbage>	i remember i tried to tell you twice about it and you seemed to ignore it both times, which was kind of annoying
<d_garbage>	rtl8192su
<threegen>	supergeek800 is is only stable because it was rolledback because of the same issues from 4.0.1-4.
<supergeek800>	d_garbage: yeah, that's the one, did not compile.
<dacoit>	!shatner
<d_garbage>	supergeek800, for the love of fucking god yes it does

<d_garbage>	the one from the 'chunkeey' repo. i built it yesterday, and told you about it. twice
<mnathani_>	yaourt - how do i get that on a base arch install?
<dacoit>	download it
<dacoit>	or dont, preferably
<mnathani_>	got the tar ball
<d_garbage>	!give mnathani_ aur
<mnathani_>	now i need to know how to install it
<phrik>	mnathani_: the trasheap of arch. dig around enough and you might just find some gold. https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/aur
<dacoit>	!yaourt2
<phrik>	yaourt is a pacman and aur frontend that is often broken and has a tendency to do stupid things, but if you want to use it anyway: http://archlinux.fr/yaourt-en
<dacoit>	^ instructions
<mnathani_>	thanks
<agent_white>	io error on nfs mounted directory. smartctl says the drive is ok. *crosses fingers for badblocks to say it's ok*
<d_garbage>	don't install it if you don't understand the build system
<supergeek800>	i'm just going to shut up and assume i was doing something wrong or running a kernel too old for it.
<dacoit>	"-sy yaourt" fta :/
<d_garbage>	if you just copy/paste instructions to get it installed you'll never learn anything after that
<d_garbage>	or at least it's likely to happen anyway
<qubitnerd>	 mnathani_ also give this a read http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2013/04/09/helpers/
<phrik>	title: aur helpers - jasonwryan.com (at jasonwryan.com)
<d_garbage>	which would be a shame because the abs is easy to learn an useful
<ron89>	isn't it just build with script and then install the compiled package?
<mnathani_>	thanks for the input d_garbage
<dacoit>	build with makepkg
<d_garbage>	ron89, yeah but people have a tendancy to use it and not learn the build system as a result
<mnathani_>	and i will check that link qubitnerd
<d_garbage>	and also because of yaurt wrapping pacman and makepkg together they get confused about wha the aur is in relation to arch
<supergeek800>	d_garbage: might try compiling it again in linux-lts should ck go to 4.0, and see if i can't get it to successfully compile in that kernel,.
<d_garbage>	it works, i built it yesterday
<d_garbage>	sheeesh
<hejki>	anyone italian awake? :)
<supergeek800>	going to try that again.
<d_garbage>	non
<hejki>	i would need a quick translation of a receipt, so help would be appreciated.
<dacoit>	haha welcome to #archlinux
<hejki>	the article in the receipt says: "an. ten. x albero intermedio sostituito"
<mnathani_>	can someone translate what this command is doing> makepkg -si
<jasonwryan>	man makepkg
<dacoit>	man makepkg
<d_garbage>	mnathani_, man makepkg
<jasonwryan>	heh
<qubitnerd>	lololol
<mnathani_>	three times the charm
<d_garbage>	oh, lol
<mnathani_>	i guess i need to hit up the man pages
<ron89>	i have a question, i've checked all forums i can for it. but there seems to be no solution. my wireless card require firmware for ath10k/qca6174. but current linux-kernel don't have it. is there a way to make the wireless card work?
<scimmia>	d_garbage, did you build that module against lts?
<d_garbage>	scimmia, linux-ck
<scimmia>	d_garbage, and that's the issue. it doesn't work with a kernel as old as lts
<d_garbage>	3.19.6-1-ck
<scimmia>	it was looking for a function that was added later, around 3.16
<ron89>	the wireless card is atheros killer n1525.
<d_garbage>	scimmia, sure but the only reason they're using -lts is because 4 doesn't boot
<supergeek800>	that's the reason i'm using -ck currently.
<d_garbage>	^
<scimmia>	d_garbage, well, he's running 3.19 right now, which works with the wireless card
<scimmia>	so it's irrelevant there
<d_garbage>	well, if the damn thing works who fucking cares then
<d_garbage>	job done
<d_garbage>	!next
<phrik>	another satisfied customer! next!
<scimmia>	yep, exactly
<dacoit>	!give hejki google translate italian to english albero intermedio sostituito
<phrik>	hejki: error: something's broken...
<dacoit>	:/
<dacoit>	i tried
<qubitnerd>	!translate
<hejki>	dacoit: albero intermedio sostituito is roughly "intermedia shaft replaced"
<d_garbage>	think translate is broken anyway
<hejki>	but wtf means 'an. ten. x'
<dacoit>	!shrug2
<phrik>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<hejki>	ancona tenuro x?
<hejki>	tenuto*
<qubitnerd>	ten is x in roman numerals ...hmmmmmmmmmmmm
<ron89>	lol, people use x for lot of things these days
<dacoit>	rome is in italy..... hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
<qubitnerd>	we are getting somewhere with this
<scimmia>	oh, supergeek800 fwiw, i tried 4.0 on an old system of mine that uses r300 with no problem, so it's probably something specific to your card if it is a video problem
<ron89>	right...
<ausseh>	sheep: you talked about changing bootloaders
<supergeek800>	could wait 'till xf86-video-ati is updated and try mainline and see if it boots then.
<supergeek800>	unless 4.x.x hates the x1150.
<threegen>	for fks sake, all 4.x.x kernels panic on any hardware.
<ausseh>	just had a kernel panic on my pi
<dacoit>	!fud
<phrik>	fucked up developers
<threegen>	it's a known bug stop going in circles around it here. downgrade to 3.19-7 like everyone else and live with it.
<d_garbage>	something about the 4.x kernel induces extreme rage
<ron89>	... i am using 4.*.* kernel... and it's not panicing?
<d_garbage>	grats
<threegen>	you're lucky.
<d_garbage>	!panic
<phrik>	http://eured.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/oh-noes-everybody-panic.gif
<threegen>	most people panic. repock on archforums, page 84-85 if you don't believe me.
<dacoit>	panic! at the disco
<d_garbage>	i think it's maybe the dumb 3 -> 4 thing
<ron89>	i see
<d_garbage>	like that means anything
<threegen>	i panicked many times rebooting. thought my hdd was dying/i did something bad. nope, bad kernel.
<threegen>	also randomly froze.
<d_garbage>	if it was just 3.x +1 it wouldn't be so annoying
<threegen>	hard.
<d_garbage>	i think it's got indoctrinated into people that a bumped major version number is somehow orgasmically exciting, radical different and life challengingly important
<supergeek800>	meanwhile it's been a nightmare for my ass.
<d_garbage>	that's just my point, it's irrelevant for your ass
<threegen>	d_garbage for amd hardware, it is a huge jump, lol.
<threegen>	thats about it really.
<d_garbage>	the 4 is just because they didn't want the 3. number to get too big. it's afaik otherwise insignificant in any way
<supergeek800>	and a few others are having a hard time with it as well, according to threegen.
<ausseh>	holy shit
<ausseh>	i actually made it into uefi boot
<ausseh>	:d
<d_garbage>	\o/
<ausseh>	no kidding
<supergeek800>	nice!
<ausseh>	after using rufus to install the .iso
<threegen>	according to: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=111715&p=94
<phrik>	title: unofficial linux-ck repo with cpu optimized packages is online (page 94) / creating & modifying packages / arch linux forums (at bbs.archlinux.org)
<d_garbage>	supergeek800, yes but no more so than if it had been 3.20 rather than 4.0 is what i'm saying
<threegen>	2 pages of people listing hardware of the panics they're getting. mostly i7's, but i run an fx-8350 and it panics, too.
<supergeek800>	d_garbage: well, i guess.
<d_garbage>	the '4' signifies nothing extra special in any way
<scimmia>	threegen, problems with linux-ck do not mean problems with the kernel
<d_garbage>	yeah there's a problem with the patch for the 'the latest kernel'
<supergeek800>	threegen: and i'm running a sempron 3400+ with x1150 and it won't even boot -mainline, let alone -arch.
<threegen>	the problem is kernel related. the patch, on old, and the newest supposedly fix it. the problem is being looked at. if we knew the exact cause, we'd have it fixed. it's most likely kernel related.
<supergeek800>	boots -ck and -lts no prob though.
<scimmia>	threegen, it's most likely ck1 related, not upstream kernel related
<scimmia>	or bfs related
<d_garbage>	depend on what you're defining as 'the problem'
<threegen>	but the patch works on _both_ the newest kernel source, and the 3.19 source. just not 4.0.-rc3+4
<supergeek800>	i'm currently using -ck because it's at the latest kernel version that my system will currently boot, 3.19.7.
<threegen>	maybe it's a bit racy, who knows, but if a kernel change triggered it, something is wrong. the kernel is playing into it somewhere.
<d_garbage>	yes but the 'something' is the patch
<scimmia>	threegen, the kernel changes all of the time. when you start with unofficial patches, things can get screwed up
<threegen>	supergeek800 exactly, they downgraded repock packages to 3.19 because of the panics. i was downgradeed 2 days after the old came out.
<threegen>	possibly, but even then, the kernel is to blame. might not be _bad_ but something has changed, affecting the bfs/bfq.
<d_garbage>	erm
<d_garbage>	if you're patching something, isn't the onus on you to make it works, not vice versa?
<ausseh>	$esp/loader/entries/arch.conf
<scimmia>	lol, you're saying that the kernel shouldn't make changes that can break unoffical patches?
<ausseh>	goes where?
<ausseh>	is that in efi?
<threegen>	no, i'm not saying that. but a kernel change has caused a breakage. the problem is the kernel. it's not the kernels problem, which is what you're pinging me as stating it.
<threegen>	holy hell;.
<threegen>	back to idle. just keep talking about how 4.0.1 is crashing and nobody knows lol.
<d_garbage>	yeah it's just your choice of words
<d_garbage>	"the problem is the kernel" vs "the problem is the patch doesn't work with the kernel"
<threegen>	the problem [for the patch] is the kernel
<d_garbage>	yay!
<scimmia>	the kernel changed caused breakage, but that is expected. the kernel is not "the problem"
<d_garbage>	<3
<d_garbage>	scimmia, too late, they fixed it ;)
<threegen>	it could be a kernel breakage though, we don't know for sure.
<threegen>	considering it panics intel and amd hardware...not good.
<scimmia>	threegen, since the stock kernel doesn't have the problem, it's pretty unlikely
<jushur>	4.0.1 with cfq sheduler = unstable, switch to noop if you have ssd and it should be stable. (atleast it is here)
<d_garbage>	nvidia }:]
<sudokode>	.
<threegen>	i've never tried stock with it, so can't say.
<d_garbage>	well if there's somthing funky going on in the area of schedulers, that might hint at why the -ck patch is running into trouble
<threegen>	rpock runs bfq, not cfq afaik.
<threegen>	repock*
<jushur>	i find it kinda hilarious it always breaks on huge name/number changes.
<d_garbage>	yes, as a coincidence you mean?
<jushur>	yea
<d_garbage>	yea
<d_garbage>	it's one of those things like, whenever you look something up in a map book, it always seems to be at the edge of the page :p
<supergeek800>	huh, may give -arch another shot, if it boots, unlike what mainline shows, i'll be ecstatic, if not, oh wells.
<ausseh>	okay, gonna need some help here...
<jushur>	im starting to think its not the actuall sheduler that is at fault, but how the kernel communicates when using them. something changed slightly since previous version.
<ausseh>	on boot i get [depend] dependency failed for /boot.
<d_garbage>	supergeek800, man if it's working ok now, stop fiddling with it
<ausseh>	and it placed me in emergency mode
<d_garbage>	supergeek800, try again in a week or so
<threegen>	if you had crashes in mainline, isn't mainline patchless?
<d_garbage>	ausseh, oh, did we celebrate too soon? :(
<ausseh>	i think so
<d_garbage>	*single tear*
<supergeek800>	actually, going to try -mainline again, just because, brb.
<ausseh>	dependency failed for local filesystems
<threegen>	make sure you get -5 with the fixes.
<d_garbage>	they left
<ausseh>	failed for fs check on /dev/disk/by-uuid/c6cc-83a2
<ausseh>	in fstab?
<d_garbage>	lsblk -f for a list
<ausseh>	i have everything
<d_garbage>	what fs is it?
<threegen>	if you formatted a drive, it'll have a new uuid.
<ausseh>	that one is /boot
<uncle_ben>	i installed, then uninstalled pulseaudio and now my audio is borked
<ausseh>	c6cc-83a2 is the uuid
<ausseh>	boot is on efi partition?
<d_garbage>	is boot the efi part?
<ausseh>	so change uuid to efi?
<threegen>	no no no.
<d_garbage>	no
<ausseh>	my boot is listed under efi in fstab
<d_garbage>	go back to the docs and check how it should be?
<d_garbage>	i've no idea personally
<d_garbage>	ausseh, look on the bright side, one that fucker is installed you'll probably never, ever have to do it again
<threegen>	*is thankful i turned uefi off because useless.
<ausseh>	i fucking hope not
<ausseh>	that was honestly the most brutal thing i've ever installed
<mnathani_>	i have tmux installed on arch, but how can i figure out what ctrl + b  replacement is
<d_garbage>	that's why i laugh at the idea of using another distro's installer to do it and then install from existing... }:]
<d_garbage>	it's probably what i'd do
<mnathani_>	ctrl +b +c should open a new window / pane
<supergeek800>	still no boot with -mainline.
<threegen>	so it's scheduling in general that's fudged.
<d_garbage>	sounds like
<supergeek800>	and the likely patched 4.0 is still in [testing].
<supergeek800>	*4.0.2
<threegen>	you did compile rc5 yes?
<jasonwryan>	mnathani_: ctrl-b c opens a new window, by default
<threegen>	rc5 fixed issues for most people in repock.
<supergeek800>	threegen: installed from the [miffe] repo.
<threegen>	idk wtf that is.
<mnathani_>	jasonwryan: thats what i thought
<ausseh>	omfg
<mnathani_>	but it isnt doing that on my install
<ausseh>	made it to the login page
<supergeek800>	the unofficial repo for the -mainline kernel, threegen.

<phrik>	d_garbage: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/unofficial_user_repositories
<ausseh>	what's the general username???
<jasonwryan>	have you changed the config?
<threegen>	uh oh he's made it too far, reformat.
<ausseh>	because i don't remember setting one
<threegen>	i get what the repo is, but never heard of that one.
<ausseh>	no kidding xd
<d_garbage>	ausseh, root
<ausseh>	i was pissed off earlier
<mnathani_>	jasonwryan: have not, stock install
<ausseh>	set my hostname to linux-sucks
<d_garbage>	ausseh, don't blame you after 11 hours
<ausseh>	made me laugh after actually getting this far
<jasonwryan>	mnathani_: then i have no idea…
<supergeek800>	threegen: it's for if you'd rather install the precompiled -mainline binary than compile it from aur.
<ausseh>	oh, also, was watching a youtube vid last night.. this guy kept referring to ubuntu as "you-boon-toh"
<threegen>	gotcha. is it up to date?
<jasabella>	i had to disappear sorry ausseh :(
<ausseh>	that's fine... i got it. after 11 hours and a lot of bothering everyone
<d_garbage>	ausseh, maybe that's how you pronounce it
<threegen>	hmmm seems to be many version. -shrugs- i'll just watch repock and see when it's fixed and the real problem.
<d_garbage>	it's some african word, isn't it?
<ausseh>	there's no "o" at the end though d:
<ausseh>	yeah, it's african
<fungle>	mnathani: tmux list-keys
<jasabella>	it's officially pronounced ooh-bun-too
<mnathani_>	jasonwryan: just found it it was using ctrl +a instead of b
<jasonwryan>	so you configured it to do that
<threegen>	i've always said you boon to, but it is ooohh boon to.
<mnathani_>	probably should have mentioned its a vagrant image

<ausseh>	okay, what's everyone's favorite window manager? i heard kde was pretty cool
<jasonwryan>	dwm
<d_garbage>	ausseh, kde is de, kwin is the wm
<jasonwryan>	kde isn't a wm
<jasabella>	openbox is minimal if you're into that kind of thing
<fungle>	i use herbstluftwm, but i also have bspwm
<ausseh>	how do i install these to check them out? pacman -s kwin

<d_garbage>	only once every few years
<jasonwryan>	like clockwork
<d_garbage>	how long since 3/4 now?
<scimmia>	yeah, i'm running plasma5, as long as you keep it minimal, it's fine

<ausseh>	pacman -s gnome
<ausseh>	?
<d_garbage>	well, 5 and a bit since it was completely unusable for the first year or so :p
<d_garbage>	it's just the price you pay for rolling release i guess
<ausseh>	oh wait, the wiki
<ausseh>	o.o
<ausseh>	i suppose it's easy to switch between desktop environments?
<d_garbage>	sure
<d_garbage>	get a display manager

<james0r>	i'm not sure what i'm doing wrong here, anytime i search on the arch package search site it yields no results or undesired stuff
<d_garbage>	i'd be tempted to clone your disk first, so you never have to install again :p
<jasabella>	ausseh... get a displaymanager
<james0r>	say if i search for 'plasma-desktop' with 'any' arch selected and 'extra' repo selected i should see the package show up right?
<ausseh>	well, went to download gdm
<ausseh>	got nothing but errors on retrieving
<ausseh>	good thing i'm not epileptic
<threegen>	set up dhcpd :)
<jasabella>	and dont forget to install xorg-server
<scimmia>	james0r, where are you searching?
<threegen>	or make sure it's working lol.
<d_garbage>	james0r, don't bother with the restrictions
<james0r>	scimmia: archlinux.org/packages/
<d_garbage>	just bung in 'plasma' or use pacman -ss
<james0r>	d_garbage: no matter what i do i don't get a results

<james0r>	d_garbage: what i'm really after is this, what if i want to see version information for stable/testing of a specific package?
<scimmia>	james0r, does that link work?
<abrarsyed>	i already ran the hwclock command, but itsstill broke.. any ideas?
<james0r>	scimmia: checking it now
<threegen>	abrarsyed look up setting up ntp on your system.
<supergeek800>	ausseh: !wiki improving system stability
<james0r>	scimmia: it does
<threegen>	my system was always 5 minutes off unless i did that.
<supergeek800>	fucck!
<james0r>	scimmia: i guess it's me then, so you don't select anything from arch or repository?
<d_garbage>	not generally any need to
<threegen>	also abyrarsyed, make sure you also select the right region if you have any clock movements, or else it won't do them.
<scimmia>	james0r, i selected the extra repo, but didn't select an arch. that's probably your problem, "any" means packages with the arch set as "any", not "any architecture"
<james0r>	is that a bug then that if you select the proper repo it doesn't show the results? sounds not desirable

<uncle_ben>	what's the best way to troubleshoot a sudden loss of system audio?  i already know it's not a hardware/speaker issue
<scimmia>	uncle_ben, check to see if it's muted. that's the most common cause
<uncle_ben>	it's not
<d_garbage>	if you have pulseaudio run pavucontrol and see if the little bars are wiggling :)
<scimmia>	uncle_ben, none of the output? alsa, pulse, or jack?
<uncle_ben>	i had alsa, the installed pulseaudio to get skype functional, then uninstalled pulseauido
<threegen>	uncle_ben is it an nvidia card output? those can be fixed sometimes switching to the right output sink in pavucontrol. it probably isn't, but that's one issue i've had.
<scimmia>	uncle_ben, ok, so you're back to straight alsa? in that case, check alsamixer
<uncle_ben>	threegen, it's an audigy card
<jushur>	uncle_ben: did you restart your session after you removed pulseaudio?
<uncle_ben>	scimmia, i did...it's not muted
<d_garbage>	uncle_ben, there wsa the classic thing with augigy that they default to digital output
<d_garbage>	was*
<threegen>	no clue on that, sorry.
<d_garbage>	uncle_ben, so check that maybe
<uncle_ben>	jushur, yes, i rebooted multiple times...even booted into a livecd and audio worked
<jushur>	uncle_ben: probably stale .config files messing it up
<uncle_ben>	jushur, yeah, i'm sure it's either a config issue or something is blocking output
<d_garbage>	i still have my trusty ancient audigy soundblaster somewhere. trouble is nothing fits on this tiny, badly designed cheep mobo
<d_garbage>	will have to fix that next time i hav any money
<d_garbage>	have*
<uncle_ben>	d_garbage, digital output is muted
<d_garbage>	well, worth a try
<d_garbage>	wait muted? or selected?
<d_garbage>	try toggling it :)
<james0r>	i'm seeing that i should be able to use something like 'pacman -ss extra/plasma-desktop' to narrow my searches to a repo but that command doesn't seem to work with searching, only installing.
<james0r>	is there a way to searching within a specific repo using pacman?
<uncle_ben>	d_garbage, i just unmuted it but it didn't make a difference
<d_garbage>	james0r, pacman -sl extra | grep plasma-desktop
<james0r>	d_garbage: gotcha thx
<d_garbage>	uncle_ben, oh well
<abrarsyed>	anyone here use lightdm and know a decent looking greeter??
<d_garbage>	i have a kind of 'once something's working, don't bloody touch it again' philosophy :p
<jushur>	abrarsyed: any of them are decent ,)
<jushur>	abrarsyed: general advice would be use the one that fits your dm/de
<uncle_ben>	d_garbage, me too...unfortunately skype requires pulseaudio
<abrarsyed>	anything as nice as the archlinux webkit theme on the aur?? thats beutiful.. but the webkit greeter doesnt work so well
<d_garbage>	i tried 'improving' my fonts a while ago and spent several hours cursing myself :p
<d_garbage>	uncle_ben, pulseaudio is nice, just use that
<d_garbage>	been ages since it was a horrible piece of shit that everyone hated
<uncle_ben>	d_garbage, yeah, if it fixes the issue
<d_garbage>	i used it with my bluetooth headphone to switch streams when they were turned on, worked a treat
<d_garbage>	also per-app volumes
<uncle_ben>	d_garbage, i'll give it another try
<d_garbage>	it still has the dumb 'flat volumes' by default though so you need to tweak that
<d_garbage>	so dumb
<junka>	  dhcpcd or dhclient ?
<junka>	which one does the archiso use
<fungle>	dhclient has less issues
<fungle>	dhcpcd can sometimes be problematic
<scimmia>	if you're just doing a simple wired connection, take a serious look at systemd-networkd. it has it's own dhcp implementation that is supposed to be very fast
<tylerdurden01>	scimmia: and if i'm doing a wireless connection to a router?
<scimmia>	tylerdurden01, it can work, too, it's just more work.
<scimmia>	tylerdurden01, if it's something that changes networks frequently, that's where things like networkmanager and connman shine
<mnathani_>	is google chrome an unsave aur package to install?
<mnathani_>	*unsafe
<scimmia>	mnathani_, i wouldn't say unsafe, but i would say useless. chromium does everything chrome will do and does it better
<ausseh>	i have internet via ethernet on the live cd, but not on the os.
<ausseh>	thoughts?
<scimmia>	ausseh, did you configure it on the installed os?
<ausseh>	i don't know... i thought it was just working..
<scimmia>	!give ausseh wiki network
<phrik>	ausseh: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/network_configuration
<bakednotfried>	ausseh you probably didn't set dhcpcd to start at boot
<junka>	^
<ausseh>	where's the wiki?
<ausseh>	>.<
<bakednotfried>	ausseh on the internet
<jasabella>	ausseh... archlinux is heaven when it comes to documentation
<jasabella>	learn to love their wiki
<jasabella>	(heaven for an open source project)
<mnathani_>	does the aur have a mirrorlist?
<jeromelanteri>	i follow this: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=162768  for have pci-passthrough on my gtx750 nvidia, but at step of start qemu-system-x86_64, i have errors
<phrik>	title: kvm vga-passthrough using the new vfio-vga support in kernel =>3.9 / community contributions / arch linux forums (at bbs.archlinux.org)
<scimmia>	mnathani_, there are no mirrors, it's not a repo
<jeromelanteri>	could you help ? (i would like to pastebin with curl xi, i not remember the command line...)
<scimmia>	!give jeromelanteri ix
<phrik>	jeromelanteri: curl -f 'f:1=<-' ix.io
<scimmia>	i won't be able to help with the error, though
<jeromelanteri>	the comand line seems to not works fine... so: http://pastebin.com/qurgperw
<phrik>	title: errors - pastebin.com (at pastebin.com)
<jeromelanteri>	scimmia: maybe an other one know goo qemu kvm could later... i will see.
<grayshade>	what can i do to reduce the power usage of my computer? i changed the tunables from powertop and i set my radeon dpm profile to battery/low, but that only got me about 5 w
<grayshade>	but it still uses 20 w more than windows
<fungle>	!giv grayshade wiki tlp
<fungle>	!give grayshade wiki tlp
<phrik>	grayshade: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/tlp
<grayshade>	an have a newish intel cpu with pstate support, and seems to bring the frequency down to 800 mhz
<grayshade>	fungle: hm, no difference between tlp battery mode and my settings
<junka>	i cant get netctl to worko.o
<junka>	do i need to enable the dhclient service?
<fungle>	grayshade: did you check out the tlp conf file
<fungle>	grayshade: in /etc/default/tlp
<grayshade>	fungle: i skimmed it, but they're mostly things i had already done with powertop and radeon dpm
<fungle>	are you using proprietary drivers?
<grayshade>	no
<jeromelanteri>	unkown public key on install. how to resolve ?
<grayshade>	last time i tried, catalyst didn't work on my laptop
<jeromelanteri>	for linux-vfio and linux-vfio-headers
<fungle>	usually proprietary drivers for gpu has better power management
<grayshade>	jeromelanteri: see pacman-key -r and pacman-key --lsign, iirc
<jeromelanteri>	ok
<grayshade>	!give jeromelanteri pacman-key
<phrik>	jeromelanteri: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman-key
<grayshade>	does this work?
<grayshade>	yep
<grayshade>	i'd try to disable my radeon card if i knew how to do that
<junka>	with networkd do  i need to create the symbolic link on every boot?
<grayshade>	junka: for resolvd?
<junka>	grayshade; ye
<junka>	er for resolv.conf
<grayshade>	junka: normally not
<grayshade>	junka: it might get overwritten by something else (networkmanager, dhcpcd)
<jeromelanteri>	i think i no need this linux kernel modules, they are allready inside
<junka>	which dhcp does networkd support
<smirky>	amcrae: i guess it would take more than a few weeks, more like a few months to get gcc in shape for the new abi rebuild
<amcrae>	nah - three more bugs to fix and then we will go for it!
<smirky>	the rebuild or the hello [core] part?
<smirky>	or both :)
<amcrae>	why wait - nothing could possibly go wrong :p
<ambsace>	does 48c to 52c seem a little high for hard drive temperatures in a small file server (with what seems to be a high disk failure rate?)
<grayshade>	ambsace: i'd say so
<grayshade>	ambsace: see https://www.backblaze.com/blog/hard-drive-temperature-does-it-matter/
<phrik>	title: hard drive temperature - does it matter? (at www.backblaze.com)
<grayshade>	so what should i pick between xf86-video-ati/intel and the modesetting driver?
<tomty89>	obviously depending on your chip?
<junka>	does plasma-nm work with lxqt?
<grayshade>	tomty89: what do you mean?
<arojas>	junka: plasma applets only work in plasma
<ausseh>	startx made my screen flash a bit, then go back to command line
<ausseh>	command not found xinit:
<tomty89>	grayshade: oh don't mind me, seems this modesetting driver is something i missed
<tomty89>	!give grayshade tias
<phrik>	grayshade: try it and see™
<grayshade>	tomty89: kernel modesetting works on my system, but i don't know what are the caveats of using that xorg driver
<grayshade>	xorg seems to prefer xf86-video-ati if it's installed
<tomty89>	it seems to be some new generic ddx
<ausseh>	startx on gnome gives me 3 command line boxes...?
<grayshade>	ausseh: you probably want to install gdm
<grayshade>	you might want*
<ausseh>	i did
<ausseh>	reinstalled to make sure
<grayshade>	then kill x and try systemctl start gdm
<tomty89>	ausseh: paste .xinitrc
<ausseh>	that's my issue, i don't know where the hell that file is
<grayshade>	ausseh: you have two choices: either have gdm (a graphical login screen) start on boot and input your credentials there
<ausseh>	systemctl start gdm gave me: oh no! something has gone wrong
<ausseh>	but a nice screen...
<grayshade>	ausseh: or log in to the text console and type startx
<tomty89>	woo finally http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=linux-4.1-gtx-750-nouveau
<phrik>	title: the nvidia gtx 750 will finally run easy with acceleration on linux 4.1 - phoronix (at www.phoronix.com)
<ausseh>	so what's up with that?
<ausseh>	oh no! something has gone wrong. a problem has occurred and the system can't recover. please log out and try again.
<grayshade>	ausseh: that's after you type your password?
<ausseh>	yes
<ausseh>	typing systemctl start gdm
<ausseh>	then it pops up with that
<d_garbage>	ausseh, how did you set up xorg?
<ausseh>	installed it
<ausseh>	o.o
<d_garbage>	!give ausseh wiki xorg
<phrik>	ausseh: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xorg
<grayshade>	maybe you could check the journal and ~/.local/share/xorg/
<d_garbage>	don't install the xorg group, you don't need all the drivers
<grayshade>	d_garbage: startx works for him, so xorg is not completely broken
<dan39>	1whats easier, encrypt full hdd or encrypt a partition? or something else?
<ausseh>	also, dhcpcd eth0 doesn't work any longer
<d_garbage>	you're going to cause yourself a lot of unnecessary pain by guessing and assuming things
<supergeek800>	so, a gpu will function on mainline finally.
<supergeek800>	too bad it ain't (afaik) amd yet.
<ausseh>	suppose you're right; however 'dhcpcd eth0' is supposed to bring up eth0. :|
<d_garbage>	there is no eth0 anymore
<ausseh>	it worked before o_o
<ausseh>	40 minutes ago
<d_garbage>	and pacman -syu xorg is not how you install xorg
<supergeek800>	anyways, i'm reaching my mental limits for staying up without trying to nod off, so night!
<jushur>	ausseh: by default arch will rename your eth0 to enp6s0
<d_garbage>	ausseh, https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/network_configuration#network_interfaces
<phrik>	title: network configuration - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<jasabella>	pacman -s xorg-server
<d_garbage>	xorg-server and xorg-server-utils and -syu us a good habit to learn
<tomty89>	seems this xf86-video-modesetting is gonna be a nice thing
<jasabella>	dont think i need xorg-server-utils just yet
<tomty89>	almost sounds like intel is getting back to a sane track
<d_garbage>	plus the driver of choice
<jushur>	im still waiting for a proper vsync without tearing, will probably die by old age tho before that happens.
<tomty89>	this whole text is so ironic http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=x.org-modesetting-page-flip
<phrik>	title: intel works on page-flipping for the mode-setting driver - phoronix (at www.phoronix.com)
<tomty89>	hope they end the tripod soon by going straight to glamor
<grayshade>	wow, my keyboard backlight uses 5 w
<tomty89>	xf86-video-intel 3.0 is just meh, let it rot
<jasabella>	so i know this is going to be painful, but how painful is it to install oracle java 7?
<jasabella>	i'm using the mesa driver hmmm
<tomty89>	but i guess sooner all later all open source driver in the kernel would be tainted by stupid "spec-conforming" color range auto switch from intel
<grayshade>	jasabella: i see that aur has jre7
<tomty89>	sigh
<ausseh>	and still can't get eth0 up... i've read the wiki
<grayshade>	jasabella: i installed the jre package yesterday (oracle jre 8) and it was as painless as it could be
<tomty89>	at least radeon is copying the "tearfree" idea from intel already
<jasabella>	i want jdk
<tomty89>	dvi ftw for them :|
<tylerdurden01>	never had any tearing problems with the intel gpu :o
<grayshade>	jasabella: oh. i see it is in aur, but i didn't try it, sorry
<tomty89>	well the tearfree quirk doesn't harm unless it's enabled by default without being made side-effect free
<tomty89>	after all it's xorg to be blamed for this
<grayshade>	tomty89: perhaps wayland will save us
<tomty89>	but it's just a waste of time to devote into something that destined to be quirky
<ausseh>	xorg-server-utils does not exist
<ausseh>	and justfound it
<ausseh>	found*
<tomty89>	eww
<grayshade>	ausseh: can you check journalctl -e and ~/.local/share/xorg for errors?
<tomty89>	ausseh: install only what you need
<tomty89>	that's a deprecated meta-package i think
<ausseh>	failed to add filters: no such file or directory
<tomty89>	grayshade: wayland will eventually be the answer i guess, because even nvidia starts doing work for it
<grayshade>	tomty89: i tried it, but it was too annoying
<tomty89>	grayshade: although i worried a bit whether idiobuntu's mir would harm it
<grayshade>	tomty89: no clipboard yet and libinput hates my touchpad
<tomty89>	grayshade: i'll say it's still a bit early
<grayshade>	or my workflow, at least
<ausseh>	arch hates me
<wasamasa>	lol
<grayshade>	ausseh: do you have a "gnome on wayland" option if you click that gear icon in gdm?
<ausseh>	i can't click anaything o_o
<ausseh>	that was a fail
<tomty89>	gnome hates you
<ausseh>	is there anything a bit more simple? plasma?
<tomty89>	perhaps
<ausseh>	i just need to see a mouse cursor again xd
<grayshade>	am i the only one who wants middle click on touchpads?
<tomty89>	i3 is much more simple
<jasabella>	did you create a .xinitrc? :)
<arch-tk>	dwm > *
<ausseh>	create???
<tomty89>	grayshade: you just need some two button emulation don't you?
<ausseh>	i have to create one?
<jasabella>	oh wait
<ausseh>	i had assumed it already existed...
<jasabella>	you're using a dm
<jasabella>	nm
<grayshade>	tomty89: i want to be able to configure the emulation
<grayshade>	tomty89: with the synaptics driver i can middle-click with two fingers
<grayshade>	tomty89: with libinput i must either bend my hand awkwardly or use three fingers instead of two (but the latter stopped working a few releases ago)
<grayshade>	the developers implied that allowing the user to configure that middle click gesture would complicate the driver too much
<grayshade>	i was afraid to ask/search about other gestures like back and forward
<jasabella>	does gdm allow one to login as root?
<jasabella>	or does it ignore root?
<grayshade>	jasabella: mine does
<tomty89>	jasabella: not a nice practise anyway
<jasabella>	plasma5 one ignores the root account :)
<jasabella>	yea
<jasabella>	i been lazy
<jasabella>	still need to create my user account
<jasabella>	sitting on root lol
<lswart>	does anyone here use wpa_cli to connect to wifi? if so, how do you connect to an ssid that contains unicode? for example, "cafe 123", where the `e` is accented? i am using systemd-networkd and wpa_supplicant, and i wonder if there is an easier way to configure a new wifi network rather than typing in the ssid.
<tomty89>	ausseh: why assume that :p
<mrelendig>	lswart: networkmanager
<ausseh>	the wiki said "edit" not "create" :p
<tomty89>	ausseh: i bet it say copy first
<ausseh>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/gnome
<phrik>	title: gnome - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<ausseh>	it didn't, at least i don't think it did...
<heftig>	lswart: use iw (dev) scan and copy the ssid
<tomty89>	ausseh: who knows which line you read
<tomty89>	ausseh: also, if you edit you know it doesn't exist
<tomty89>	ausseh: so you didn't follow it anyway o/
<ausseh>	o.o
<tomty89>	gdm shouldn't need a .xinitrc though
<jasabella>	yea
<jasabella>	unless you startx manually
<jasabella>	i dont know which route he's taking
<lswart>	mrelendig: i was looking for something a little more simple and minimal than networkmanager, alhtough i've heard good things about it. i am currently trying to keep things simple with systemd-networkd and wpa_supplicant, although it does require more of a learning curve. if it doesn't support something like ssid's with unicode, however, i may turn to something more batteries-included, like networkmanager.
<mrelendig>	lswart: networkmanager is simple
<tomty89>	he seems panicked an trying everything at the same time :3
<tomty89>	*and
<grayshade>	ausseh: what if you create another user and try with that?
<mrelendig>	lswart: protip: you can use it from the cli too if you are one of those people
<ausseh>	wiki?
<ausseh>	xd
<jushur>	lswart: there is a console gui for networkmanager also, nmtui
<junka>	how can i run wpa_passphrase x x > /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf
<junka>	wit sude
<tomty89>	jushur: or nmcli actually?
<tomty89>	jushur: tui is cursed-ish thing
<grayshade>	junka: echo foo | sudo tee file
<tomty89>	*curses
<jasabella>	tee :d
<jushur>	tomty89: hmm, i said gui right? :d
<tylerdurden01>	junka: or just create it in your home directory and sudo mv it
<tomty89>	jushur: oh
<grayshade>	junka: or sudo bash -c "echo foo > file", i suppose
<tomty89>	curses lover :#
<junka>	thanks grayshade, tylerdurden01
<jasabella>	does he need to do systemctl enable gdm?
<jushur>	tomty89: well its not by choise realy, but its what my ppl liked most. and i tend to take in that info and use it when reckomending to new ppl to.
<grayshade>	ausseh: and if you've lost your mouse in gdm, you can restart it with systemctl restart gdm
<mrelendig>	ppl is not a word
<tomty89>	jushur: no don't make a boring world. recommend what you like
<jushur>	tomty89: most ppl dont like "vi" ,)
<tomty89>	(even when it's shit? maybe)
<ausseh>	starting gdm just returns that error... white screen with sadface image...
<d_garbage>	is 'reckomending' like a really bad suggestion? }:]
<tomty89>	ausseh: can you at least check journal
<jasabella>	i wonder what would happen if i set startx as my log in shell :)
<jasabella>	ausseh... journalctl -xe
<tomty89>	ausseh: i know, that screen is probably worse the bsod for noobs
<jasabella>	read error messages, google them, :p
<d_garbage>	i followed you advice and got reckt, way to reckomend dude :p
<grayshade>	jasabella: you lose ssh?
<d_garbage>	!sting
<phrik>	ba-dum *ching*
<jasabella>	grayshade... apart from that :)
<tomty89>	what so good about -xe
<ausseh>	oh wonderful
<jushur>	ausseh: do you have xorg-xinit installed?
<jasabella>	oh yeah
<jasabella>	that package
<jasabella>	lol
<grayshade>	jasabella: you won't be able to open a terminal?
<ausseh>	yes
<tomty89>	-b / -p 3 / -u / -f is much better
<grayshade>	xorg-xinit isn't needed for gdm
<lswart>	mrelendig: thanks for the tip. i am probably "on of those people" who feels more comfortable with cli for networking. i will see if i can make it work on my current setup, because it seems really relaible, except in the cases where it may not be (i haven't tested it on an ssid with unicode)
<tylerdurden01>	speaking of journalctl -xe, does anyone know why the colors don't show up correctly in most, the pager app?
<jasabella>	grayshade... hehe
<lswart>	err "one of those people"
<tomty89>	note: when attaching journalctl output to bug reports, please do not use -x
<pandb>	is there someone who can look at this and tell me what they think my next step should be? http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/202368/bluetooth-cant-find-default-controller

<ausseh>	o_o
<grayshade>	ausseh: nvidia?
<ausseh>	yes
<grayshade>	:-< it's 2015 already
<grayshade>	come on linux, get your stuff together
<grayshade>	ausseh: are you using the nvidia driver?
<ausseh>	i chose #3 whenever downloading the dm
<ausseh>	nvidia 340.x
<lswart>	heftig: thanks for the recommendation. `iw wlp4s0 scan | grep ssid` seems to be a good shortcut to copy/paste the ssid into wpa_cli. but i wonder what is the output when there is unicode in the ssid? perhaps it depends on my terminal? i think i'm using urxvt and bash...
<tomty89>	pandb: check about rt2800 in dmesg?
<tomty89>	pandb: maybe missing firmware
<tomty89>	(and perhaps not supported)
<jasabella>	lswart... am i  being stupid in thinking it is a good idea to have a set of commandline utisl for connecting to wifi, in case my gui wont work? :) (i like connecting manually, not automatically on boot)
<jushur>	lswart: try doing the same inside a tmux session?
<grayshade>	ausseh: what was #3?
<tomty89>	ausseh: pacman -qs nvidia; lspci | grep -i vga
<grayshade>	ausseh: also, try with a different user account
<heftig>	lswart: the output will be unicode
<ausseh>	that was #3, grayshade.
<tomty89>	...
<grayshade>	ausseh: and check what's in /etc/x11. on my system x works without anything in there
<ausseh>	tomty89: returns local/libvdpau 1.1-1
<ausseh>	several other nvidia things
<lswart>	joshur: i almost always use the terminal within a tmux session. i guess tmux supports unicode? i copy/paste to/from the terminal using tmux as well, so that might be useful too
<tomty89>	ausseh: can you just paste to a pastebin instead of saying "other stuff"
<ausseh>	i suppose... no way of copying, lol
<tomty89>	!echo what was? that was! what was? that! that!
<phrik>	what was? that was! what was? that! that!
<d_garbage>	why are you flailing around at random and asking people to fix things up when it doesn't work?
<grayshade>	ausseh: install wgetpaste
<junka>	so, networkd has it's own dhcp resolver?
<ausseh>	because there are over two thousand people here; i'd hope someone would know how to fix what i've never dabbled in.

<jushur>	lswart: jushur is my nick, and yes tmux supports it, and i belive it req some config settings to enable it by default for all instances.
<pandb>	tomty89: no mention of rt2800

<firedingo>	so i've got this application i want to run in the background. i don't want it visible at all. in windows i could force it to hide in the tray and it was perfect. now it's in my face using arch and i'm wondering how i might go about hiding it in the tray as well?
<tomty89>	enti: you do not see that in findmnt?
<pandb>	jushur: i have linux-firmware, i'm installing bluez-firmware right now
<tomty89>	sigh
<tomty89>	don't busy on pulling everything you aren't sure it's appropriate
<enti>	tomty89: no. is that something systemd is supposed to be setting up?
<tomty89>	like that rt2860 for a case
<d_garbage>	firedingo, pacman -ss tray
<firedingo>	ah ok. thanks d_garbage :)
<tomty89>	extra/bluez-firmware 1.2-8
<tomty89>	    firmwares for broadcom bcm203x and stlc2300 bluetooth chips
<pandb>	oh that's probably not what i wanted :)
<d_garbage>	firedingo, if kde i think there's a setting for that also
<tomty89>	enti: kind of
<rrva>	kernel is compiled with gcc 5.x, but arch is still on gcc 4.x. this is causing failed gcc installation checks (has to be same major version)
<pandb>	since i have ralink
<pandb>	i just assumed since i installed bluez and bluez-utils already
<tomty89>	pandb: just check where comes this rt2860 and maybe uninstall it it
<rrva>	isn't it better if the package 'linux' is compiled with 4.x until 5.x is out of testing?
<d_garbage>	rrva, was a slip up
<firedingo>	d_garbage, yeah i have kde but as i'm new i'm still learning the little things
<pandb>	tomty89: what do you mean, like `pacman -ss rt2860`?
<enti>	tomty89: ok that i might be out of luck. using openrc here.
<tomty89>	pandb: -qi i think
<tomty89>	enti: not sure then
<pandb>	error: package 'rt2860' was not found
<mrelendig>	-qs 2860
<mrelendig>	but maybe you built it by hand?
<mrelendig>	-qo the .ko
<tomty89>	pandb: modinfo rt2860, -qo the path
<pandb>	i built something by hand, but i think it was rt3290
<tomty89>	pandb: rt3290sta i guess
<tomty89>	i don't see that in my system as well
<d_garbage>	firedingo, it's part of application properties (advanced options) "place in system tray"
<ausseh>	great, now, when i reboot, don't even get to login. just that white screen of death with error messages.
<lswart>	jasabella: i think using graphical vs command-line networking tools depends on your setup and time worth spending to learn the command-line tools. i am pretty to arch (~1.5 months) but i think if you take the time to master a few low-level tools, it will be more reliable, especially when troubleshooting or optimizing your network configuration.
<lswart>	i'm sure many graphical tools are considered very reliable, although i probably have less trust than most in graphical interfaces. for example, i'm using xmonad instead of a desktop environment, and for things like wifi, i'd prefer to manage my networks using only text-based tools.
<tomty89>	pandb: did you confirm rt2800pci doesn't work for you at all?
<ineb>	is it possible to change the keyboard-layout as long as i press a special key? i need that mainly go generate umlauts.
<ausseh>	i can press enter for logout, but it just comes right back to this screen.
<mrelendig>	lswart: nmtui
<firedingo>	ah ok. thanks d_garbage
<rrva>	d_garbage: so i'll install testing/gcc then?
<mrelendig>	!give ineb wiki keyboard
<phrik>	ineb: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/category:keyboards
<mrelendig>	fail
<mrelendig>	ineb: you can define multiple layouts and a combo to switch between them
<d_garbage>	rrva, you can rebuild the kernel using abs, though whether that's the best option i couldn't say
<pandb>	tomty89: i haven't really confirmed anything yet
<ineb>	mrelendig: sounds good. do you have instructions for that?
<d_garbage>	rrva, gcc5 has problems, that's why it's in testing
<pandb>	modinfo rt3290sta gives(among other things): parm:           mac:rt28xx: wireless mac addr (charp)

<ausseh>	any thoughts on getting out of this window???
<ausseh>	ctrl + c/q/w doesn't work.
<jushur>	pandb: you need to blacklist, rt2800pci rt2x00pci , so rt3290sta can work without interference from those.
<tomty89>	no!!!!
<pandb>	no?
<amcrae>	were any bugs filed about the kernel being compiled with gcc-5?
<tomty89>	what interference is here? it's just itself not working
<amcrae>	i bet the developer involved does not realise yet
<pandb>	jushur that sounds like a highly promising suggestion, unless tomty80's emphatic "no!!!" was directed at it
<tomty89>	pandb: also rt2800pci is supposed to support your device and the firmware required is in linux-firmware package
<jasabella>	dang, i like what debian does... commands that require sudo access arent in the path of non-root accounts
<tomty89>	pandb: it's not loaded anyway
<tomty89>	pandb: because whatever you built/install is picked
<tomty89>	so the blacklist is probably like a no-op
<jasabella>	~~~
<pandb>	so...

<enti>	could someone help me with getting rid of orphans on my system? i'm not sure what they actually are, becuase there's always packages that don't depend on any other packages, so removing all orphans would remove a lot of programs i need.
<d_garbage>	amcrae, good point
<pandb>	so i need rt2800pci, and not rt3290?
<d_garbage>	enti, make a list and see which ones you don't want?
<tomty89>	pandb: i don't know, that's why i ask you to try
<tylerdurden01>	ha, my laptop's wireless card does have monitor mode after all! now i can spy on my neighbours!
<tomty89>	pandb: at least it seems plausible
<lswart>	mrelendig: is your opinion that nmtui is just as minimal, yet more reliable and feature-rich than a wpa_supplicant and systemd-networkd manager setup? i think you are probably right, and i should try out nmtui at some point, but i think i am enjoying chasing my current rabbit hole :-)
<enti>	d_garbage: so it's normal that i've got orphans i don't want to get rid of?
<jasabella>	$ pacman -qdt\
<tomty89>	pandb: and you're having problem with what you got
<tomty89>	or -qdtt
<pandb>	k, because i'm reading your messages and it's not entirely clear what you've "asked" me to try
<d_garbage>	enti, contrawise mark ones you're sure you want as explicitly installed
<d_garbage>	enti, pretty much, yes
<pandb>	i know i'm not supposed to ask you and all that, but i thought i'd let you know
<enti>	d_garbage: k thx. that was actually all i wanted to know :)
<tomty89>	pandb: you can see three different modules available for your devices in lspci -k right?
<tomty89>	pandb: but two of them doesn't belong to the repo kernel, and you're using one of the two
<mrelendig>	lswart: it is more reliable and feature rich yes
<tomty89>	pandb: so i asked you to use the path provided in modinfo
<pandb>	tomty89: apparently yes
<tomty89>	pandb: use pacman -qo with the path and check which package own them
<tomty89>	pandb: and try to uninstall it
<pandb>	k will do
<pandb>	thanks man :)
<tomty89>	pandb: and get to the track of using the driver comes with the kernel
<tomty89>	which the firmware should be pulled if you're using the repo "linux" kernel
<jushur>	rt3290sta and rt2800pci is incompat, use one of them.. note that rt2800pci is uptodate with the current kernel. and should be the preffered choise. while the rt3290sta is out of sync and needs edits to compile correctly with current kernel.
<d_garbage>	amcrae, yes https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/44784
<phrik>	title: fs#44784 : [linux] kernel 4.0.1-1-arch was compiled with gcc-5.1 (at bugs.archlinux.org)
<pandb>	jushur: thanks, that makes a little more sense
<rrva>	thanks, then it'll be sorted
<d_garbage>	it takes about 20mins or so to compile the kernel on an i5 by the way
<pandb>	error: no package owns /lib/modules/4.0.1-1-arch/kernel/drivers/wireless/rt3290sta.ko
<pandb>	that was from modinfo rt3290sta
<smirky>	d_garbage: not true, my i5 2500 does it for like 1h
<jushur>	pandb: i do asume you installed it from the aur?
<tomty89>	pandb: what about the other one?
<d_garbage>	smirky, how many threads?
<smirky>	d_garbage: 4 i guess, in makepkg.conf for sure
<rrva>	d_garbage: i wish there was a set of compile scripts to use ec2 for that, large instance, copy pkg.tar.xz back to me
<pandb>	there's nothing else in that directory, and modinfo doesn't seem to give anything for rt2800, rt2860, or adding 'sta' to the end of either of those
<pandb>	jushur: actually i built it from source
<d_garbage>	smirky, if you set it, it's 1 by default iirc
<pandb>	no aur
<tomty89>	pandb: heh mv the whole wireless directory to somewhere else i guess :|
<smirky>	d_garbage: so makepkg.conf doesnt help?
<jushur>	pandb: that is why you get that error, its not registered in the system db for installed packages.
<pandb>	k
<pandb>	but it shows up in lsmod
<tomty89>	pandb: it's weird that `modinfo rt2860` doesn't give you info
<d_garbage>	smirky, sure if you actually set it: makeflags="-j4"
<pandb>	ohhh i see what you mean
<smirky>	d_garbage: well i did as i told you :) so it's not like every i5
<tomty89>	pandb: wait, what did you build from source? a kernel?
<jushur>	tomty89: rt3290sta steals focus, thats why
<smirky>	d_garbage: depends on the cpu generation
<tomty89>	jushur: wat?
<pandb>	tomty89: no the rt3290sta.ko was from source
<jushur>	tomty89: he compiled the driver module rt3290sta from src
<tomty89>	i wonder where comes the rt2860 then
<d_garbage>	smirky, i5-2320 cpu @ 3.00ghz
<tomty89>	even if it belongs to rt3290sta modinfo should tell something, shouldn't it
<smirky>	d_garbage: intel(r) core(tm) i5-2500 cpu @ 3.30ghz
<jushur>	tomty89: rt2860 is from rt2800pci, submodule pulled in as a "solution". this is why i said to blacklist them
<pandb>	oh crap, i'm sorry, the rt2860 might have been what i compiled from source
<pandb>	but the directory says rt3290
<d_garbage>	smirky, wonder why it takes 3 times longer then?
<jushur>	pandb: realy?
<smirky>	d_garbage: you can't possible do it in 20 minutes, not unless you disabled uneeded modules to compile
<tomty89>	jushur: doesn't sound make sense as well
<jushur>	pandb: you cant be unsure about this kind of things
<pandb>	here's the directory: dpo_rt3290_linuxsta_v2600_20120508
<smirky>	d_garbage: if it's the stock kernel, no way
<pandb>	one of the files in it: rt2860sta.dat
<d_garbage>	smirky, nope it's 25 mins including download. i build the linux-ck kernel all the time and have timed it many times
<pandb>	ushur i know, i'm sorry
<smirky>	d_garbage: what do you use, btw? gcc or gcc-multilib?
<tomty89>	jushur: <jushur> tomty89: rt2860 is from rt2800pci, did you send that based on pure guess...?
<smirky>	d_garbage: which i guess doesn't matter
<tomty89>	*say
<d_garbage>	gcc-multilib
<smirky>	d_garbage: me too
<d_garbage>	i must have timed it at least a dozen times
<tomty89>	jushur: or the submodule theory, actually
<smirky>	d_garbage: i'm willing to time it again though, without doing anything except irc chat
<d_garbage>	/usr/bin/time makepkg -scr
<jushur>	tomty89: i have experience with this chipset family, its a mess..
<smirky>	d_garbage: yep, time is what i was gonna use :)
<d_garbage>	don't use the -i flag or it will include time waiting for your input
<jushur>	tomty89: also its visible in the url he posted earlier
<smirky>	d_garbage: $ time makepkg -s -r
<tomty89>	jushur: you know what, the driver might support different model and use different firmware (.bin), but this submodule thing you said is not valid
<tomty89>	jushur: because it'll still shows as rt2800pci
<tomty89>	since there's only one .ko
<d_garbage>	smirky, sure. two things though time is not the same as /usr/bin/time (the former is a bash built-in) and you can combine flags -sr
<smirky>	d_garbage: it wont really effect anything i guess
<smirky>	d_garbage: but good to know
<d_garbage>	smirky, /usr/bin/time is better, you need to install it
<tomty89>	jushur: oppositely, you can see different things when you `modinfo snd` and `modinfo snd-hda-intel` and more
<tomty89>	unless they are built into the kernel as builtin
<jushur>	tomty89: he posted a lspci -k that shows, kernel driver in use: rt2860 , kernel modules: rt2800pci, rt3290sta
<pandb>	only rt3290sta is loaded, apparently?
<tomty89>	hmm i guess i get what you are talking about
<pandb>	perhaps i should unload it, and load rt2800pci instead?
<tomty89>	jushur: apparently i've never come across to module like that
<pandb>	since rt2800pci seems to come iwth the kernel
<tomty89>	so maybe you're actually using rt2800pci then
<tomty89>	my fault
<pandb>	lsmod | grep rt only gave rt3290
<pandb>	no rt2800
<tomty89>	hmm
<pandb>	but i just did modrobe rt2800pci so that's loaded now
<tomty89>	pandb: then maybe this submodule thing applies to both drivers
<tomty89>	pandb: and that doesn't stop the fact that rt3290sta is the one being used
<pandb>	yeah
<tomty89>	because of what you see in lsmod
<tomty89>	pandb: so i guess what i suggested is still something you should try
<tomty89>	pandb: just i was wrong on some theory
<jushur>	pandb: rt3290sta will steal focus over rt2800pci, this is why it looks like it does. so either blacklist rt2800pci and rt2x00pci or blacklist rt3290sta. you cant use both at the same time.
<pandb>	tomty89: what was that
<pandb>	cool
<tomty89>	pandb: that you have three drivers and one comes from nowhere
<tomty89>	and yes blacklist is an alternative than moving it out
<pandb>	will do
<tomty89>	*to
<tomty89>	pandb: but blacklist the right one
<tomty89>	pandb: which is rt3290sta, otherwise it means nothing, because it's the one got preferred
<pandb>	that makes sense
<tomty89>	hmm `lspci -k` is a bit no so nice for when there are multiple modules then...
<tomty89>	requires a manual check with lsmod :|
<tomty89>	can't it show something like kernel driver in use: rt3290sta->rt2860 :p
<pandb>	thanks for your help guys
<smirky>	d_garbage: still compiling :d
<rrva>	d_garbage: using gcc-5 to compile vmware modules causes machine to reboot when using the vmhgfs kernel module. i don't even see the kernel panic message.. how to get it?
<mrelendig>	contact vmware customer support
<d_garbage>	rrva, ^
<jushur>	rrva: what kernel you on?
<rrva>	4.0.1
<rrva>	i'll try to build kernel with gcc 4.x now
<smirky>	d_garbage: do you have thermald, cpupower?
<d_garbage>	smirky, i disable pstates if that makes a difference
<d_garbage>	using the old 'ondemand' power scheme
<d_garbage>	i'd be very suprised if that made a 3x impact
<d_garbage>	i'm betting it just doesn't take as long as you think it does on your machine
<smirky>	i'm not touching the pc atm, only to reply here... i even stopped mpd to keep the hdd io for the compilation process
<d_garbage>	4gb ram also
<smirky>	8gb
<smirky>	but not 1600 mhz
<d_garbage>	not especially fast ram either
<d_garbage>	i find if i'm watching a stream or video or something it might take maybe 2 mins longer
<smirky>	stock cooler?
<d_garbage>	oh and of course linux-ck
<smirky>	well i'm compiling the stock linux package
<d_garbage>	smirky, i guess, nothing fancy
<smirky>	but a single patch wont make that much of a difference
<smirky>	i guess?
<grayshade>	rrva: is that gcc 5.1?
<d_garbage>	smirky, in terms of the package itelf the difference it trivial, it;s just a patch. what i mean is it's also compiled *with* linux-ck :)
<d_garbage>	yes
<smirky>	the cpu is at 4x100% and at 68 temp
<rrva>	grayshade: yes, it's current testing/gcc package
<rrva>	x86_64
<grayshade>	rrva: be careful with that, i lost quite a bit of time because of it
<rrva>	i will recompile kernel now for 4.x
<d_garbage>	smirky, well my cores don't seem to max out all at 100% all the time but that may just be the monitor
<grayshade>	rrva: it was generating bad code
<grayshade>	rrva: like "functions not getting called" bad
<rrva>	ouch
<rrva>	then i guess the proper resolution for https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/44784 is to rebuild kernel with 4.x
<phrik>	title: fs#44784 : [linux] kernel 4.0.1-1-arch was compiled with gcc-5.1 (at bugs.archlinux.org)

<d_garbage>	bit slow actually, was messing around with things while it was building
<smirky>	d_garbage: gonna report any time soon :d
<d_garbage>	so yeah, probably it just 'felt like' an hour
<d_garbage>	or there was a gap between it finishing and you noticing

<d_garbage>	sure
<smirky>	hm... weird indeed
<smirky>	well it could be from your kernel
<d_garbage>	though it tried compiling in a tty once and it seemed to make no noticeable difference, iirc
<smirky>	but it can't be all because of that
<d_garbage>	dunno
<smirky>	i have a few daemons on background but they don't bother the cpu much
<d_garbage>	i enable bfq is that makes any difference
<smirky>	everything is on default here :)
<d_garbage>	it's hard to see what would make such a big impact though
<smirky>	except the thermald and cpupower i guess
<smirky>	which i'm thinking might have to do something with that

<ausseh>	and view what i have executing on boot?
<smirky>	d_garbage: disabled them and still at 1.60 ghz
<d_garbage>	smirky, looks like you found the problem then, running at less than 1/2 speed
<d_garbage>	or maybe not 'less than' 2x1.6= 3.2 :p

<ausseh>	anyway, it works on both monitors - extended display, rather than the duplicate i've had all day.
<ausseh>	i uninstalled nvidia-340xx or something
<qubitnerd>	!twss
<phrik>	that's what she said!
<ausseh>	installed nvidia
<qubitnerd>	hmmmm
<d_garbage>	ausseh, phew
<ausseh>	what were you thinking?
<rrva>	how would i go about to capture the kernel panic message on the console in vmware?
<d_garbage>	ausseh, why didn't you use the nvidia one to start with?
<ausseh>	i'm not sure, really... how do i make terminal come up? i've been clicking it and it acts like it's opening, then closes.
<rrva>	ah, i'll just boot to single-user and look with journalctl
<d_garbage>	ausseh, oh sometimes people download the driver from the nvidia site and install it with the nvidia installer
<d_garbage>	messy
<d_garbage>	ausseh, did you set the system up? locale and so on?
<ausseh>	all i did was press the reset button o_o
<ausseh>	just came up, graphical environment
<d_garbage>	?
<d_garbage>	did you configure the system?
<ausseh>	what do you mean by that, exactly???
<d_garbage>	!give ausseh install
<phrik>	ausseh: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide
<ausseh>	oh yes, a long time ago
<ausseh>	just been having trouble with nvidia
<demonicmaniac3>	earnestly: woot. nick clegg and ed milliband resigned o.o
<d_garbage>	ausseh, i donno then try a different terminal like xterm or somthing?
<d_garbage>	gnome terminal seems a bit finicky these days
<grawity>	hmm, in what sense
<ausseh>	uxterm tried unsuccessfully to use locale en_us.utf-8 by setting $lang to "en_us.utf-8"
<grawity>	as opposed to setting $lang?
<d_garbage>	grawity, dunno, just seen a few people having problems with it since the lat update
<d_garbage>	last*.
<earnestly>	ausseh: please don't use uxterm, use xterm -u8
<earnestly>	or set the utf8 property in your xresources
<ausseh>	uxterm is all that's available, aside from terminal
<earnestly>	ausseh: excuse me?
<d_garbage>	extra/xterm
<ausseh>	i see no other o.o
<earnestly>	ausseh: /usr/bin/uxterm is owned by xterm
<ausseh>	there it is!
<d_garbage>	man you really need some sleep i feel
<ausseh>	you're right >:|
<grawity>	oh, wait, uxterm, not urxvt
<grawity>	yeah, uxterm is evil
<earnestly>	uxterm, and koi8xterm, both mangle the locale for better or worse.  it's better to simply avoid them and use -u8
<qubitnerd>	grawity needs some sleeps too
<grawity>	if you ever think you need to use uxterm, you actually need to fix your locale settings globally instead
<grawity>	having different locale settings in the terminal & outside it will only result in more confusion
<qubitnerd>	!w typoglycemia
<phrik>	qubitnerd: typoglycemia - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/typoglycemia>
<ausseh>	i come to you from irssi, on my new arch desktop lol
<d_garbage>	lol
<earnestly>	ausseh: now get some sleep :p
<teraflop>	:d
<d_garbage>	"it's necer as sweet as the first time" :p
<ausseh>	believe i'll do that... sorry for being so bothersome today. :/
<earnestly>	all the new knowledge needs a chance to rebuild larger synpases, constructed with calcium scafolding
<d_garbage>	never* damnit
<d_garbage>	lol ~root@
<earnestly>	well, yeah
<teraflop>	earnestly: yeah i believe so
<earnestly>	teraflop: my very unscientific opinion is that i blame this period of time for the moments of complete derpitude before it "clicks"
<earnestly>	that is, the time it takes for a neural pathway to be rebuilt, larger
<teraflop>	earnestly: for me, just let the issues for tomorrow and get some sleep is enough most of the times
<demonicmaniac3>	earnestly: so tory don't even need to enter any coalition now with having more than 50% of the seats?
<earnestly>	teraflop: oh, i know that this is how we "learn" on a neurological level, but i have no basis to assume it is why i am so stupid before it finally makes sense, where it is whatever i'm trying to understand :p
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: yep
<metaory>	kernel 4.0.1-1-arch yay!
<teraflop>	earnestly: heh what the hell happened with the polls in the uk?
<demonicmaniac3>	earnestly: sad
<teraflop>	i know, people lies
<demonicmaniac3>	earnestly: get the hell out of there quickly :p
<earnestly>	teraflop: no body knows
<metaory>	57% - 43% the poll
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: all of them were crap.  it's this problem all over the place: https://youtu.be/jngikr90zu8
<triplc>	hi all
<teraflop>	if it's white and it comes in bottle it is milk, so i think people lied
<triplc>	so installing libreoffice require some coin-* packages
<earnestly>	triplc: used for some of the opengl effects i assume
<earnestly>	probably slide transitions, i'm guessing
<thelemonman>	and i've finally found some time to migrate the network setup from netctl to systemd-networkd
<triplc>	thelemonman: oh.. i am using netctl now; what's the benefits of systemd-networkd ?
<thelemonman>	the dhcp server seems to be faster than i expected, maybe it's just a placebo effect
<demonicmaniac3>	earnestly: i believe it was just cameron's cheap shots about "no tax raise"
<demonicmaniac3>	and people believing promises about taxes still and lining their own pockets
<junka>	teraflop; i sent u a msg
<teraflop>	junka: try harder i do not see any pm :p
<teraflop>	junka: or it was a memo thing or whatever it is named?
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: once a politician is in power, they can do whatever they want
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: they could implement the other parties policy if they wanted; they might not get voted for again
<teraflop>	junka: what the message is, now im restless
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: but most important things aren't voted for.  do we want the hs2?  no voting there
<demonicmaniac3>	yeah
<demonicmaniac3>	at least one good thing came out of it though with ukip failing
<teraflop>	damnit, he left

<junka>	teraflop; is the holland dnscrypt server regurally down?
<teraflop>	junka: the one i use in my configs?
<teraflop>	config*
<junka>	teraflop; you use the second one
<junka>	i'm talking about the first
<cukier>	hello. every time i plug in or unplug it resets my alsa volume settings. does anybody know where i can disable this behavior? or at least change what it resets to?
<grawity>	try `sudo alsactl store`
<cukier>	i don't want my headphones muted every time i plug them. :(
<cukier>	didn't work.
<cukier>	unfortunately.
<grawity>	unmute them, *then* store
<grawity>	unless you use pulseaudio?
<cukier>	i did it.
<teraflop>	junka: hmm, no idea, the one i use never gave me problems, but sometines i remember that sometimes i got troubles with the certificate (only a couple of times), if it fails then it seems that the server is down

<junka>	teraflop; ok thanks
<metaory>	who is skynet?
<metaory>	skynet, the us-based company which builds robots
<teraflop>	junka: so check the journal about certs and fingerprints, i guess
<tomty89>	cukier: automute switch in alsamixer?
<grawity>	cukier: yes, but is it running?
<teraflop>	junka: np
<tomty89>	metaory: the two sentences has no logical linking?

<statelesscat>	archlinux wasnt rolling release at the first ?
<tomty89>	so i need some intimacy with phrik

<mrelendig>	statelesscat: not really
<mrelendig>	statelesscat: that was the version of the install image
<mrelendig>	statelesscat: arch was rolling release from the start
<statelesscat>	ok :)
<earnestly>	keenerd: hah, this is similar to mtts
<mrelendig>	well, sort of rolling anyway
<tomty89>	the old arch logo looks like a picasso tux
<statelesscat>	tomty89: or an blue arch with a yellow d*ck :/

<statelesscat>	yes

<a-109-107>	did anything change with the linux 4.0 regarding thinkpad special buttons support? like xf86launch1
<tomty89>	a-109-107: do you see anything change in xev? *shrug*
<a-109-107>	tomty89: the buttons that are now unresponsive don't send any keycodes :(
<a-109-107>	and they definitely must've
<a-109-107>	because i never did anything custom to the keycodes
<vlatkob>	firefox, palemoon and chromium are not rendering text inside <pre> tags. seems like a system issue. tried changing monospace font in ff, but no change. any advice to try?
<a-109-107>	vlatkob: did you try launching ff in 'safe mode'?
<tomty89>	a-109-107: so nothing happen when you press them in xev?
<a-109-107>	tomty89: absolutely no effect
<tomty89>	:|
<vlatkob>	just tried that, the same. tried with empty profile, the same.
<a-109-107>	but suprisingly some other 'function keys' do still work
<a-109-107>	tomty89: any idea which level of the system might impact that? keycodes? xmodmap? or even lower?
<a-109-107>	vlatkob: do you what font is supposed to be used there? maybe your file is corrupted/missing/weird?
<tomty89>	a-109-107: no idea, maybe evdev or kernel driver for your beyboard
<a-109-107>	tomty89: thanks, on elast things - is this something that might've been 'reduced/switched off' when moving to linux 4.0?
<vlatkob>	a-109-107: i tried several fonts in ff, arial, times. the same. but strange is that chromium also doesn't render <pre>.
<a-109-107>	vlatkob: that's really really weird; can't think of anything else, sorry
<vlatkob>	thanks anyway
<tomty89>	vlatkob: what do you mean byt not render? you mean the text is simply not there?
<vlatkob>	tomty89: yes, text around <pre> is displayed, but inside <pre> is just empty. though, i can select it, and it is there. but the selection on page look very short. as if there are few chars, but there are more. tried changing the size to 36, no change.
<tomty89>	vlatkob: do you have a sample test file? i see no such problem here
<jhass>	a-109-107: no real why, but perhaps a workaround: maybe the stuff in https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/map_scancodes_to_keycodes still works for you
<phrik>	title: map scancodes to keycodes - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)

<tomty89>	vlatkob: try this file and see if it's the same case http://ix.io/iru
<vlatkob>	tomty89: between "running example" and "our running example ..." i see a white background, nothing else.
<phrik>	title: test (at ix.io)
<vlatkob>	tomty89: hm, i see the text.
<tomty89>	vlatkob: it seems somehow you can get access to the web font
<tomty89>	i mean online font
<vlatkob>	tomty89: can you explain?
<tomty89>	vlatkob: first try this link https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/firamono/v3/slrwfq1zeqxiywan-lng-qcwcynf_cdxxwclxiixg1c.ttf
<tomty89>	see if you can get access to it
<vlatkob>	tomty89: i downloaded it without problems.
<tomty89>	hmm
<tomty89>	then it's about rendering i guess
<tomty89>	vlatkob: because the site use a font "fira mono", which it provides a remote source
<tomty89>	vlatkob: you can try to "inspect element" the empty place you see
<tomty89>	but i don't know why it cause problem to you...as you can access to the remote source
<fenrig>	hi i'm having some seriously troubling problems when i just updated my arch installation
<fenrig>	i can't use vmware, because apparently the kernel is compiled with gcc 5.1 (which isn't in core yet)
<jhass>	vlatkob: you might want to try to reproduce the issue on a new account, to exclude any potential font configs lurking somewhere in your home
<fenrig>	and for some reason i can't play any video's using vlc, some problem with gstreamer and the decoder. maybe something to do with hardware acceleration on my intel integrated gpu
<vlatkob>	tomty89: i looked at element in firebug and inspector, and all seems fine. inspector doesn't complain about the font missing or corrupt.
<vlatkob>	jhass: i'll try this.
<tomty89>	vlatkob: http://ix.io/irv see if you can toggle the problem by commenting/uncommenting the "src:" line in this file
<phrik>	title: test (at ix.io)
<fenrig>	why is gcc 5.1 still in testing and linux kernel 4.0 (which is built with that gcc not?)
<vlatkob>	jhass: tried it as another clean user, and the problem's gone. text is shown. :-) so it is probably something with fonts?
<jhass>	vlatkob: worth an investigation at least
<jhass>	if i only could remember the location for the configs...
<jhass>	vlatkob: okay, check if you have stuff at/in: ~/.fonts.conf/, ~/.fonts.conf.d/ ~/.fontconfig/, ~/.config/fontconfig/
<vlatkob>	tomty89: commenting/uncommenting have no effect. no rendering.
<tomty89>	hmm
<tomty89>	vlatkob: but removing the whole <style> make it comes back right?
<amcrae>	fenrig: mostly incompetence
<tomty89>	fenrig: what does gstreamer have to do with vlc :/
<fenrig>	amcrae: obviously, now i can't use vmware anymore
<jamesbong>	hi there, again
<fenrig>	tomty89: vlc uses gstreamer apparently
<vlatkob>	tomty89: no, only if i remove style in <pre>, the text is rendered.
<tomty89>	vlatkob: no, invalid appearence
<tomty89>	fenrig: ^
<tomty89>	vlatkob: sorry
<tomty89>	vlatkob: seems it has problem dealing with font-family: monospace then...
<vlatkob>	tomty89: what do you mean by invalid appearence?
<tomty89>	or font-family...
<jamesbong>	what could be the reason for not being able to use ssl/tls for smtp from an arch linux box? i thought it is an thunderbird releated problem, but i have the same problem with sylpheed. the connection itself works with k9 on android. i even purged all iptable rules to try it.
<tomty89>	vlatkob: that's for someone else, don't mind it
<tomty89>	for fenrig
<cultavix>	archlinux is the future
<vlatkob>	jhass: i have none of those. should i install something?
<bystones>	can someone help me setting up offlineimap for my university account? it times out every single time. i used the simple config from the wiki and the remotehost is imap.uni-stuttgart.de. username and password do not seem to matter at all?!
<jhass>	vlatkob: no
<tomty89>	vlatkob: you can try renaming .mozilla to see if it's a mozilla config issue
<jhass>	vlatkob: do you have fonts in ~/.local/share/fonts ?
<tomty89>	vlatkob: and to be safe, also rename or remove .cache/mozilla
<sudokode>	what's a known bug
<vlatkob>	tomty89: i did that before. the same for clean profile with no extension or customizations.
<sudokode>	heh
<sudokode>	nvm
<sudokode>	why so scrolled up
<tomty89>	vlatkob: oh so something else then
<sudokode>	so much sneeze

<thelemonman>	blast you
<sudokode>	why sue?
<sudokode>	i prefer anne
<tomty89>	sudokode
<sudokode>	oh, ofc
<vlatkob>	jhass: hm, no. just trying to find any font in ~?
<sudokode>	disregard that
<jhass>	vlatkob: that were the font related locations i know, so i guess so
<tomty89>	or check anything related to font in the three musketeers
<tomty89>	i know .cache/fontconfig
<g00ey>	when i download a file then click "open folder" i always have this stupid window https://i.imgur.com/ph9wbiw.png instead of opening thunar
<g00ey>	how can i change this?
<tomty89>	vlatkob: btw what font do you see it's being used when you click on the empty code block on that site
<vlatkob>	jhass: all fonts are in /usr/share/fonts
<vlatkob>	tomty89: where can i see the font name?
<jhass>	if it works with a new user we don't need to look outside your home at all
<ahtapot>	hey i want to make shared partition withn my windows to store music and also install programs and stuff on windows. i made it ntfs but windows box doesnt sees it?
<tomty89>	vlatkob: oh "inspect element", bottom right, font tab
<strayarch>	for rc.lua, used in awesome wm, i want to use a os.execute("sleep") or socket.sleep(). however, instead of delaying in the function properly, the sleep call delays the entire loading of the wm. why?
<tom^>	strayarch: because its single threaded
<tom^>	strayarch: and you are sleeping the thread the wm runs on
<strayarch>	tom^, would a coroutine solve this issue?
<tom^>	not using sleep would solve it.
<strayarch>	>_<
<vlatkob>	tomty89: fira mono and fira mono bold
<tomty89>	vlatkob: hmm okay...may check the same thing with this http://ix.io/irz
<phrik>	title: test (at ix.io)
<tomty89>	vlatkob: and perhaps rm -r .cache/fontconfig and restart x
<strayarch>	tom^, i wanted to do a more controlled battery life  check (e.g. instead of checking every 60s, check when the batterlife is expected to be at 10%.) is it possible to do that when altering https://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/gizmoguy%27s_super-easy_acpi_battery_widget
<strayarch>	or does is the timeout static?
<tom^>	strayarch: but why?
<tom^>	strayarch: polling your battery every 60 second isnt gonna use much of your resources lol
<strayarch>	tom^, i can't see battery life when i remote into my desktop
<strayarch>	like right now xd
<arch-tk>	when you remote?
<arch-tk>	why are you using rdp?
<bystones>	can someone please help me to setup offlineimap for my university account? i tried using the example from the arch wiki (with remotehost = imap.uni-stuttgart.de) but it times out every time. changing username and/or password do nothing.
<strayarch>	shell & vnc
<arch-tk>	so you're vncing
<random-nick>	i just realised namcap is pacman reversed
<strayarch>	arch-tk, yes. i called it remotein because that's what i titled my default vnc choices
<strayarch>	arch-tk, "remotein" is the script i wrote. :s
<xintron>	is there some way to list which files xdg-open have read to build the list of default applications to use? i've checked against the list on https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/default_applications but none of the locations gives any decent information back

<tomty89>	poor documentation!
<xintron>	tomty89, been playing around with xdg-mime to query for the default application but it's not listing the fallback apps if the first one doesn't exist :/
<jamesbong>	what could be the reason for not being able to use ssl/tls for smtp from an arch linux box? i thought it is an thunderbird releated problem, but i have the same problem with sylpheed. the connection itself works with k9 on android. i even purged all iptable rules to try it.
<xintron>	(and it doesn't in my case, i just want to see where it's defined)
<ochurlaud>	hello, i have a question about pckbuild
<tomty89>	if you don't have specific setting, the default could be random
<xintron>	tomty89, the weird thing is: my query tells me firefox aurora for http, aurora is not installed anymore and the mimecache file says it's chromium
<xintron>	i just want to find the strange location where it reads in firefox aurora
<ochurlaud>	how do the program knows which commit/tag it shoudl take on git ?
<vlatkob>	tomty89: tried removing cached fontconfig and restarted, but no change. seems i'll have to chase the ghost. :-(
<tomty89>	xintron: some where in ~/.config iirc
<tomty89>	got to go
<namarrgon>	jamesbong: time/date are correct?
<holomorph>	ochurlaud: unless otherwise specified, it uses the latest revision
<ochurlaud>	so the lattest commit
<bystones>	can someone please help me to setup offlineimap for my university account? i tried using the example from the arch wiki (with remotehost = imap.uni-stuttgart.de) but it times out every time. changing username and/or password do nothing.

<ochurlaud>	holomorph: on the link i just sent, they speek about gettng the last tag
<holomorph>	relevant if there are tags in the git repository
<ochurlaud>	ok so it's maybe more secure to do so, so that people don't download a broken code (if a commit breaks something)
<tom^>	strayarch: i still dont get why sleeping is gonna solve you not seeing battery in vnc?
<ochurlaud>	holomorph: will it change what yaourt or makepkg will download ?
<jamesbong>	namarrgon: yes
<holomorph>	ochurlaud: no? see pkgver in pkgbuild(5)
<holomorph>	all pkgver() does is generate a version string
<ochurlaud>	ok so it will always download the last revision/commit.
<ochurlaud>	there is no way to redirect to the good tag/branch ?
<jamesbong>	bystones: mit welchem e-mail client und welches tutorial?
<holomorph>	ochurlaud: pkgbuild(5)
<holomorph>	read it
<bystones>	jamesbong: kein e-mail client. habe einfach offlineimap installiert und dann die config wie aus dem wiki (artikel: offlineimap) genommen. angepasst und mit "offlineimap" gestartet.
<bystones>	jamesbong: mit evolution auf meinem anderen laptop funktioniert alles wunderbar
<ochurlaud>	holomorph: ok i'll try to understand how he fragments work
<jamesbong>	bystones: ich kenne offlineimap nicht, dachte es geht darum imap zum laufen zu bekommen. ist es vielleicht eine ssl/tls einstellung?
<bystones>	jamesbong: weiß nicht wie ich das herausfinden könnte ob es daran liegt? er scheint irgendetwas zu tun bis er zu "reader poll => []" kommt und dass wiederholt sich dann so lange bis der timeout kommt.

<ochurlaud>	however is it a good practise to use the function pkgver() ?
<ochurlaud>	because i don't see how i can use it correctly, it prevent me for compiling
<ochurlaud>	getting the sources*
<gaming4jc>	anyone know how to compile nouveau with debug symbols? the default package doesn't include them and i need to report a bug in the driver.. :/

<phrik>	title: archlinux.fr - outil collaboratif (at pastebin.archlinux.fr)
<ochurlaud>	i commented the function and it works well.. but is it good?
<namarrgon>	if you are going to use tags then you don't need pkgver()
<ochurlaud>	ok.. that's what i wanted to hear :)
<ochurlaud>	thank you
<namarrgon>	but then the question is whether that package should be name -git, that usually implies that the latest revision is being used
<holomorph>	and begs the question why you don't just download a tarball
<ochurlaud>	because people don't want to download and make by hand, but that pacman help them to desinstall afterwards
<uelo>	i dont know if this is os related or it is caused by my wm, but when i boot with my mouse plugged in a usb port, the mouse is unresponsive until i press left click. after a period of inactivity it becomes unusable, and i have to press left click again. what could cause this?
<holomorph>	that's not what i meant.  why are you making a vcs package and just using a tag, rather than making a package out of that release tarball
<ochurlaud>	holomorph: yes it's true, it's stupid to download a whole git tree for a tarbal
<thelemonman>	uelo, usb autosuspend maybe
<uelo>	thelemonman: it sounds like that the mouse is autosuspended. if i plug the mouse in after boot, the problem does not occur.
<arch-tk>	so after writing an implementation of base64 in c, does anyone have a nice implementation of base64 in c (not a streaming one, one for predefined fixed width data)
<arch-tk>	ah, fuck it, mine works well enough
<ochurlaud>	holomorph: pkgbuild doesn't support metalinks?
<ochurlaud>	because the tarball  is on github (easy way) or here http://download.kde.org/unstable/macaw-movies/0.1.0/src/macaw-movies-0.1.0.tar.gz.mirrorlist
<phrik>	title: kde - experience freedom! (at download.kde.org)

<stark>	hey everyone, whenevr i'm starting emacs i'm getting this error: "emacs: error while loading shared libraries: libgnutls.so.28: cannot open shared object file: no such file or directory"  and the shared object was updated by gnutls so the older version got renmed and and the new version is present http://ix.io/is3
<stark>	my question is, should i recompile emacs-gtk2 or do i need to do something else ?
<clynamen>	you can check .so dependency with lddtree
<clynamen>	with that you can know what you have to recompile
<keenerd>	stark: emacs-gtk2 is an aur package.  always recompile them whenver you update anything.
<stark>	keenerd, yes, i was going to recompile, but before that i wanted make sure if i need to do something else or not.
<uncle_ben>	i borked my audio set up. long story short: i need to edit the correct file with the correct naming convention for my card

<stark>	berra, tl;dr `for f in *\ *; do mv -- "$f" "${f// /_}"; done`
<red-lichtie>	i've been at this for 7 hours now and i'll be damned if i can get this fn wifi dongle to work correctly. sometimes it will associate, sometimes it will even authenticate but most of the time is fails on the wpa authentication! grrrrr
<red-lichtie>	are there known issues with the current wpa_supplicant ?
<berra>	stark what is the -- in mv -- syntax for?
<aeronotix>	how do you add those warnings/message to packages after install?
<demize>	berra: `touch -- -rf; rm *`
<demize>	berra: what do you think will happen?
<demize>	well, that was mv... either way, the point still stands
<demize>	-- marks the end of the options.
<demize>	stark: anyway, that blogpost is silly. just quote stuff.
<berra>	demize so it's just to ensure santiation then. but since the filenames are quioted
<demize>	berra: the quotation is irrelevant.
<berra>	the -- will never make a difference if both mv names are quoted.
<demize>	berra: it's a shell thing. mv knows nothing about it.
<berra>	still it doesn't really make a difference now does it?
<red-lichtie>	do any of you have a working "0bda:8172 realtek semiconductor corp. rtl8191su 802.11n wlan adapter" ?
<namarrgon>	red-lichtie: how is yours not working?
<demize>	berra: how about you try it instead
<demize>	berra: touch -- -f something; mv '-f something' 'foo'
<red-lichtie>	it scans, it sees the ap and only "radndomly" connects to the ap
<namarrgon>	red-lichtie: post the log
<berra>	demize: i don't see your point. nothing after -- will be treated as an option, but even if a filename began with an option it would not be used since it's quoted.
<demize>	berra: be quiet and try it like i say and then retract your statement.
<demize>	it being quoted means nothing.
<demize>	quoting just stops word splitting /in the shell/
<demize>	'-f something' is an option string with 11 options specified.
<strayarch>	tom^, it's not, i was going to use it to control the naught-notify interval
<strayarch>	tom^, timer({ timeout = sometimeinterval()})
<strayarch>	tom^, well something of that notion. i actually changed the way i was going about the problem.
<strayarch>	is it possible to pass a function to  timer({ timeout = sometimeinterval()})
<wlritchi>	so i'm loading a keyboard layout with xkbcomp in my .xsession. it only works if i sleep for at least a second before loading it, but i know that it's running either way (with identical output) because it comes up in .xsession-errors. on another machine, the same script as a .xinitrc works fine without sleeping. any ideas for troubleshooting?

<demize>	berra: you are proving my point
<berra>	how so?
<demize>	berra: it explicitly says that it tires to intepret the space as an option

<rgb-one>	gaming4jc: alright thanks for the info.

<earnestly>	vodik: they also have what they call a "true ffi".  i'm not sure what kind of overhead it has, but it seems pretty minimal.  here's an example of using an external library in their time package: http://sprunge.us/jfac?pony
<vodik>	holomorph: no, i forgot! heh, right. i was going to rip out the symlink shit
<red-lichtie>	kilo`byte: with what?
<earnestly>	@printf[i32]("%d\n", yeah)
<kilo`byte>	good! it now is owned by my user, now just make cifs set user mask to 600
<vodik>	cloudef: 'the data should be submitted to /build/<project name>/<branch name>/<system name>'. is this a url or filesystem?
<kilo`byte>	instead of 666
<kilo`byte>	*permission mask
<red-lichtie>	and 700 for dirs
<kilo`byte>	yeah
<earnestly>	vodik: he may not get these messages, apparently his bouncer is a bit odd
<vodik>	earnestly: interesting that can support vaarg
<red-lichtie>	maybe acls are enables
<red-lichtie>	maybe acls are enabled
<vodik>	earnestly: good to know
<kilo`byte>	don't know the option for that though
<earnestly>	vodik: well, it's printf
<earnestly>	vodik: libc
<vodik>	well i have the source, best documentation
<kilo`byte>	red-lichtie: on my system or the remote one?
<earnestly>	vodik: the @ is seemingly how they do the ffi
<vodik>	holomorph: tomorrow, i'll solve it, i promise
<red-lichtie>	kilo`byte: on the nas
<kilo`byte>	how'd i check?
<vodik>	holomorph: *by tomorrow
<earnestly>	vodik: it's llvm, so i'm fairly certain they don't just translate to c
<red-lichtie>	see if it is mounted with the acl option
<vodik>	earnestly: oh, to llvm probably does it
<kilo`byte>	hmmm sec
<vodik>	earnestly: well my understanding it to do ffi on c's ... is architecture dependant
<kilo`byte>	well, it does not map nas users to unix users
<earnestly>	vodik: yeah, you can generate the ir as a compiler phase
<vodik>	which is why a lot of libraries ignore it
<earnestly>	vodik: currently it only supports x86_64
<kilo`byte>	and all shares seem to internally have the same user as owner
<earnestly>	heh @"internal.x86.cpuid"[(i32, i32, i32, i32)](i32(0))
<red-lichtie>	so the access management is strictly smb
<red-lichtie>	oh well
<kilo`byte>	yeah
<kilo`byte>	thats why i'd like cifs to set a local permission mask
<earnestly>	vodik: anyway, i like their approach anyway: https://github.com/causalityltd/ponyc/wiki/philosophy
<phrik>	title: philosophy · causalityltd/ponyc wiki · github (at github.com)
<red-lichtie>	fstab and user mountable then
<kilo`byte>	i am fairly certain there is a mount option for that, just can't find which
<holomorph>	vodik: no rush, just curious because idgi
<kilo`byte>	red-lichtie: the mounting isn't the issue, just setting the flags
<kilo`byte>	actually, why don't i check the manpage
<vodik>	holomorph: idgi?
<earnestly>	"i don't get it"
<holomorph>	vodik: i don't get it :p
<hyo0301>	what the hell is no color code
<red-lichtie>	kilo`byte: file_mode and dir_mode
<red-lichtie>	kilo`byte: see https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages-3/mount.cifs.8.html
<phrik>	title: mount.cifs (at www.samba.org)
<earnestly>	vodik: and most importantly, they're snake_case! :p
<kilo`byte>	yeah, reading the offline version of it :p
<red-lichtie>	:-d
<hyo0301>	what's the code for a transparent/blank background in json?
<hyo0301>	none, blank, transparent, " " doesn't work
<earnestly>	hyo0301: json doesn't encode anything like that.  it's program specific, json is just the serialisation format
<hyo0301>	well whatever this program is written in
<kilo`byte>	wtf
<kilo`byte>	file_mode=600,dir_mode=700 -> warning: 'file_mode' not expressed in octal. \n warning: 'dir_mode' not expressed in octal.
<sheep>	which program?
<kilo`byte>	what am i doing wrong
<hyo0301>	sheep: cortex
<earnestly>	kilo`byte: 0600
<red-lichtie>	god i'm loving this! a raspberry pi 2 as xserver to my and zero noise in my office! not even the slightest whiff of a fan or hd :-)
<hyo0301>	in the config file i have to define foreground and background for text
<hyo0301>	i want no color on background
<kilo`byte>	ah, whatever
<sheep>	how you do that depends on its configuration
<earnestly>	kilo`byte: "the  first  digit selects the set user id (4) and set group id (2) and restricted deletion or sticky (1) attributes."
<red-lichtie>	kilo`byte: 0700 and 0600 maybe ?
<kilo`byte>	okay, it does not error, but looks like data still is 777
<kilo`byte>	files are 766
<red-lichtie>	then your server is controlling that
<kilo`byte>	hmmm
<red-lichtie>	maybe only for new files ?
<red-lichtie>	and new dirs ofcourse
<kilo`byte>	well, i can probably tell cifs to ignore server side perms
<kilo`byte>	think i saw an option for that
<kilo`byte>	(i am assuming the nas is a clusterfuck)
<red-lichtie>	probably
<vodik>	earnestly: heh
<vodik>	woot, buildhck works
<earnestly>	yay
<lonewulfn6>
<kilo`byte>	i hate this...
<kilo`byte>	if that was nfs, i'd have to working long time ago
<kilo`byte>	whatever, will have to live with it

<red-lichtie>	do any of you have any experience with cephfs ? is it production ready or are the not quite ready yet comments regarding fsck and repair enough to stay away still?
<sheep>	henry_jia_t60: did you configure mkinitcpio.conf and rerun mkinitcpio?
<henry_jia_t60>	sheep: yep, i added the encryption hook
<henry_jia_t60>	sheep: re ran mkinitcpio -p linux

<henry_jia_t60>	sheep: still fails at mounting root :(

<henry_jia_t60>	viv: yep, you have voice
<viv>	henry_jia_t60, fantastic, just registered a new nick. :)
<namarrgon>	viv: we can't hear you, type louder
<red-lichtie>	earnestly: if they really can deliver for that price then there is no need to look at avrs any more
<viv>	namarrgon, does all caps help? ;)
<henry_jia_t60>	sheep: what am i meant to set root= to?
<namarrgon>	viv: we're not blind!
<henry_jia_t60>	sheep: can you give me an example?
<viv>	anyway, hey all, using openbox + arch, half of the time when i startx i get noooo mouse input whatsoever
<sheep>	henry_jia_t60: whatever cryptsetup sets it to.  i actually don't know
<red-lichtie>	viv: no mouse input or no mouse output ?
<earnestly>	red-lichtie: unless you want to mess with avrs for their much lower power consumption
<earnestly>	less of a computer/cpu, more of a micro controller
<viv>	red-lichtie, good question... it wasnt happening on other os's and only started happening recently... but i could check and see if theres something going on wiring-wise
<kilo`byte>	good, at least the backup software is working as intended
<viv>	but restarting usually fixes the issue
<red-lichtie>	i know, i use them too, but at the the price of that why go for less, unless, as you said, power consumption is an issue
<earnestly>	red-lichtie: besides, you can get much cheaper
<earnestly>	i can't remember what it's called now, little blue thing, someone put a cgi server on it.  keenerd halp
<viv>	red-lichtie, actually, my thinknub isn't working either, so i know its not my touchpad
<earnestly>	stm8?

<red-lichtie>	viv: if 'm right you can see all the events going to the xserver with that
<viv>	oh, then i would have to start x first
<viv>	hrm
<viderizer>	i find it funny that shipping costs over 2 times more than the actual product
<earnestly>	keenerd: still, $9 arm r8, 512m ram.  that's kind of silly
<viv>	i did not yet set up a key command to open terminal once i start x.... ><
<earnestly>	viderizer: yeah, bound to happen heh
<red-lichtie>	how to they get that much into such a little package, and at that price!
<viderizer>	it seems like a nice idea though, will probably buy one
<viderizer>	to accompany my nearly unused rpi :-)
<viv>	ok, looks like x does not need to be active. phew.
<red-lichtie>	viderizer: rpi = silent mail+web client!
<viderizer>	by the way, what is the easiest way of getting my mail off google's servers (or any third party whatsoever)
<red-lichtie>	fetchmail
<viderizer>	is there any idea on running a mail server on my rpi
<viderizer>	and buying a nice-looking domain for myself
<earnestly>	viderizer: ars did a long article on that

<viderizer>	now just to get the touchpad of my laptop to work...
<red-lichtie>	viderizer: nice!
<viderizer>	it seems that nvidia is shit and doesn't support laptop gpus on linux
<red-lichtie>	viv, 2 secs, need to fire up my laptop to checks
<sheep>	no, they do support them
<viv>	red-lichtie, of course ;)
<sheep>	they just don't support optimus fully
<viderizer>	shh, let me bash nvidia :c
<viderizer>	but yeah, i kind of meant that they don't support the hotswitching between the gpu and integrated
<red-lichtie>	viv, i had to sudo evtest
<viv>	red-lichtie, affirmative
<red-lichtie>	then i get a list of devices
<viv>	yes, and for me the touchpad was event13
<red-lichtie>	mine is 12
<viderizer>	can anyone poke me at the right direction on getting my touchpad working
<viv>	i got event13 from cat /proc/bus/input/devices
<viv>	viderizer, yup, follow along with us? mine just stopped working. :)
<red-lichtie>	moving my finger across it gets loads of "event: time ....." lines
<viderizer>	haha, i'll follow the conversation
<viv>	red-lichtie, then mine is not being detected. i wasn't sure if that was supposed to be the output or not.
<red-lichtie>	viderizer: you have to install the xf86-input driver :-d
<red-lichtie>	 xf86-input-synaptics
<red-lichtie>	or elographics, etc.
<viv>	i am reinstalling xf86-input-synaptics as good measure
<red-lichtie>	pacman -ss xf86-input is your friend :-)
<viv>	but so far, hasn't changed anyhing
<viderizer>	do i need to configure something myself or does the package throw a default cfg somewhere
<red-lichtie>	viv you should see the events, even if the driver isn't installed
<red-lichtie>	viderizer: i put one in /etc/x11/xorg.conf.d/
<viv>	red-lichtie, nope, no events what-so-ever. i wonder if it's a hardware issue after all... :(
<viderizer>	hmm. the bottom part of my screen is blinking black on gdm
<viv>	going to check my thinknub real quickly
<red-lichtie>	viv: :-(
<viderizer>	it goes away after i login
<viderizer>	holy fuck
<viderizer>	i can actually dim my screen with gnome
<red-lichtie>	viderizer: see https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/touchpad_synaptics
<phrik>	title: touchpad synaptics - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<viv>	oh, the thinknub isnt on /proc/bus/input/devices... weeeeird
<red-lichtie>	they have an example /etc/x11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf
<viderizer>	i can set my screen brightness with a smooth slider from 0 to max in gnome
<viv>	nice
<jasabella>	is it real dimming or is it simulated dimming? heh
<viderizer>	and windows has this crappy thing that kills my eyes with almost-sun-intensity light
<red-lichtie>	viv: any errors in dmesg ? what about lsusb ?
<viderizer>	jasabella: it seeems to be real dimming
<viderizer>	notice 3 e's
<viv>	oh whoaaaa yes red-lichtie, "failed to enable mouse on isa0060/serio1" says dmesg
<red-lichtie>	viderizer: admit it, you are just looking away from the screen telling us that it gets darker :-d
<viv>	lsusb is just informing me that i have usb capability. typical.
<viderizer>	my touchpad is also working without any additional configuration :^)
<red-lichtie>	viderizer: i enable two finger scroll in there
<viderizer>	yeah and tap to click
<red-lichtie>	oh no, i disable that one!
<viderizer>	d:
<viv>	two finger scroll sucks on my touch pad... its a tiny touch pad so it always thinks there are two fingers on it
<viderizer>	i just want a mac touchpad
<viderizer>	that's just something amazing
<viderizer>	after that everything else feels super clunky
<viderizer>	how good is gnome terminal?
<viderizer>	is there some super good terminal for arch like there is iterm2 for osx
<red-lichtie>	i've heard that their touch mice are super slick but never used one
<senketsu>	gota try em all
<red-lichtie>	viv: at least you know that the hw is there
<danthebeastman>	why am i failing so hard to set-up chrony
<viv>	yup, but now i have this mysteeeerious error message that doesn't tell me anything
<viv>	besides 'you dun goofed', that doesn't help me
<red-lichtie>	lol
<red-lichtie>	viv: try to reload the psmouse module
<viderizer>	how many people will kill me if i don't bother making a user account for myself
<viv>	i tried that and now its telling me evtest is not a file or directory. oh boy. brb.
<turks>	viderizer, at this point id suggest you in just buying a damn mac
<toombs>	viderizer: just one.
<viv>	now there is no longer an event13
<red-lichtie>	viv: seen https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=162230 ?
<viv>	rip event13
<phrik>	title: mouse and touchpad connecting and disconnecting randomly!! / kernel & hardware / arch linux forums (at bbs.archlinux.org)
<viderizer>	i don't want a mac
<red-lichtie>	viv now a 14?
<viderizer>	it's too limited for my taste
<viderizer>	although osx is very beautiful
<red-lichtie>	buy a mac and install linux :-d
<d_garbage>	danthebeastman, systemd-timesyncd
<amunak>	hmm is it possible to persuade setuid to work on directories?
<viderizer>	that might work :^)
<dacoit>	match made in heaven
<viderizer>	dacoit: i got gnome working ^^
<dacoit>	viderizer: glad to hear it :-)
<viderizer>	but macs are too expensive to buy only to install arch on it x)
<red-lichtie>	now viderizer is going to switch to cinnamon and get all the goodness he deserves
<d_garbage>	bleh
<dacoit>	amunak: what are you trying to do?
<jasabella>	hmmm should i install the tarball in /opt myself or get it from aur
<red-lichtie>	jasabella: use aur if you can
<viderizer>	red-lichtie: you should've converted me when i was still having problems with gnome
<danthebeastman>	d_garbage: i enabled and started it.. should there be some configuration first?
<d_garbage>	/usr/local is better than /opt for manual stuff
<red-lichtie>	viderizer: it needs most of the gnome3 stuff anyway
<viv>	ok, sorry, i dc'd
<amunak>	dacoit, make it so that when a file is created through samba on my storage drive it gets a generic storage user and group
<danthebeastman>	nvm found wiki page
<red-lichtie>	viderizer: it needs most of the gnome3 stuff anyway
<amunak>	the setgid bit works fine, but setuid is a problem
<d_garbage>	danthebeastman, is that a serious question?
<amunak>	as apparently it generally is ignored on directories on majority of linux systems
<viv>	red-lichtie, so i used sudo modprobe -r psmouse && sudo modprobe psmouse. this caused evtest to not detect an event13 any more and when i try to use evtest at all it just cries "no such file or directory" until i reboot.
<dacoit>	amunak: acl rules do this better
<danthebeastman>	d_garbage: no, i'm dumb, ignore me
<viderizer>	red-lichtie: how does it differ from gnome
<viv>	something's gone all wrong
<red-lichtie>	viderizer: you need only select the other de in gdm ;-)
<amunak>	dacoit, never worked with them
<red-lichtie>	viderizer: i find it a much better user interaction
<amunak>	is there a guide or something somewhere?
<dacoit>	amunak: man setfacl
<dacoit>	amunak: very easy to use
<viderizer>	red-lichtie: does the terminal of cinnamon have a solarized color scheme by default?
<dacoit>	!wiki access control list
<phrik>	dacoit: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/access_control_lists
<red-lichtie>	hapy space between gnome3 and unity
<d_garbage>	or retro bullshit, depending on your pov
<viderizer>	if it does i might try it just now before settling to gnome again
<red-lichtie>	d_garbage: very opinionated i must say! :-d
<d_garbage>	must you?
<dacoit>	haha
<viv>	red-lichtie, any idea where to go from here?
<amunak>	thanks, looks nic
<amunak>	e
<red-lichtie>	viv: sorry no, but seeing as you have a trackpoint, i guess that you have a lenovo thinkpad, so ask/google the thinkpad users
<viv>	red-lichtie, alright :)
<red-lichtie>	d_garbage: are you up for porting the zorin os packages to arch so that people can enjoy the windoze look and feel on a real os ?
<viderizer>	red-lichtie: i installed cinnamon and rebooted
<red-lichtie>	i think they are gnome based
<viderizer>	now i'm praying to the linux gods that this thing boots, doesn't look good...
<red-lichtie>	it is just another option in the gd, login
<red-lichtie>	it is just another option in the gdm login
<viderizer>	...
<viderizer>	it doesn't boot to gdm anymore
<viderizer>	what have i done
<d_garbage>	red-lichtie, rather odd question? no
<red-lichtie>	that can't be cinnamon ?
<viv>	viderizer, time to reinstall x :3
<viderizer>	red-lichtie: i didn't do /anything/ else
<viderizer>	i literally installed cinnamon and rebooted from gnme
<viv>	that happens to me sometimes
<viv>	is x not starting? just command line?
<viderizer>	but on my 3rd reboot, gdm mysteriously starts
<red-lichtie>	cinnamon is a desktop that gdm lets you select, it has to be something else that broke viderizer
<viderizer>	what is going on...
<viderizer>	okay, i managed to get to gdm
<viderizer>	how do i select cinnamon
<red-lichtie>	enter user id
<red-lichtie>	the select de in the gear wheel
<red-lichtie>	before entering the password
<viderizer>	ah, the gear appeared only on the password field
<red-lichtie>	it needs to know who you are before it can select your de
<viderizer>	cinnamon claims that i'm not connected to the internet but i am
<red-lichtie>	viderizer: probably the nm thing not playing nicely
<viderizer>	now irc'ing from arch :)
<viderizer>	nm?
<red-lichtie>	i had to disable netctl or something so that networkmanager would work
<viderizer>	i-i can't adjust the screen brightness from cinnamon easily :'(
<red-lichtie>	or start nm as a service
<red-lichtie>	lol
<viderizer>	"the system network services are not compatible with this version."
<red-lichtie>	viderizer: yepp, that is the symptom
<red-lichtie>	viderizer: systemctl start networkmanager
<red-lichtie>	or something of that ilk
<red-lichtie>	enable too if you want ;-)
<red-lichtie>	would be the same in gnome 3 iirc
<red-lichtie>	systemctl enable networkmanager.service
<red-lichtie>	systemctl start networkmanager.service
<black_prince>	ya can drop the .service part
<viderizer>	ohgod
<viderizer>	i started it and now i can't connect to my wifi anymore x_x
<red-lichtie>	you have to stop netctl (or what ever else you were using) and then configure you connections in nm

<red-lichtie>	superflat: the 777 should do it

<demonicmaniac3>	earnestly: boring
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: and cheap
<viderizer>	red-lichtie: does cinnamon have a way to fill the whole windows space with a single window
<viderizer>	like in gnome you drag it to the top of the screen
<viderizer>	in cinnamon it just makes it ½ of the screen

<red-lichtie>	and enabling edit mode
<viderizer>	i love you :3
<red-lichtie>	als press windows button to access menu, the type hot spots
<red-lichtie>	there you can enable the default "top left corner" for show all destops
<red-lichtie>	and top right for show all windows
<red-lichtie>	etc.
<red-lichtie>	ctrl-alt-up = show all workspaces

<red-lichtie>	i just find cinnamon to be a very comfortable and productive de
<ausseh>	how can i install plasma 5, then switch between it and gnome?
<red-lichtie>	ausseh: at your login dm
<viderizer>	cyanogenmod is quite nice isn't it boblehest
<ausseh>	it'll automatically switch between dm and wm?
<red-lichtie>	ausseh: one is your login manager, more of a matter of taste than anything else (unless you need xdmc), the destop environment is started for your user by the login manager after you have been authenticated
<hyo0301>	what's the difference between insertfilename-git and insertfilename in the aur?
<namarrgon>	-git usually builds the latest commit
<red-lichtie>	hyo0301: 9.14 what is the difference between foo and foo-git packages?
<red-lichtie>	hyo0301: see https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/arch_user_repository
<phrik>	title: arch user repository - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<hyo0301>	thanks
<hyo0301>	name = stable version, name-git = latest update woah the more u know
<ausseh>	for wine, what if i want to install a program that isn't on their default list?
<hyo0301>	wow
<hyo0301>	thanks
<namarrgon>	!spoon
<phrik>	namarrgon thought you needed this spoon.
<spoonfeedme>	i was quiet hungry tho
<red-lichtie>	:-d
<red-lichtie>	spoonfeedme: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/faq
<phrik>	title: faq - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<lbv_user>	hi all. i installed archlinux in a computer, it works fine, but when i shutdown it doesn't poweroff... any ideas what it could be?
<spoonfeedme>	thanks
<spoonfeedme>	very useful
<demonicmaniac3>	earnestly: hilarious they list libreoffice though
<demonicmaniac3>	512mb ram you don't run libreoffice on anything :p
<spoonfeedme>	lbv_user: for me it takes like 1 min for it to shutdown, dunno why it's a delay
<red-lichtie>	lbv_user: shutdown is not the same as halt
<earnestly>	they do apparently, probably only just
<demonicmaniac3>	the a13 is also a single core a8
<lbv_user>	red-lichtie: i used the shutdown option on cinnamon and systemctl poweroff
<demonicmaniac3>	so it's teensy bit faster than a pi1 - but just a little bit
<lbv_user>	it stops all the services, but seems to halt instead of poweroff
<demonicmaniac3>	i mean it is cheap but i really don't see the point. it's the pi2 for me really
<red-lichtie>	lbv_user: shutdown in the cinnamon dialog shuts down my system
<red-lichtie>	lbv_user: maybe a polkit issue?
<lbv_user>	red-lichtie: idk but i'm thining the issue could be some incompatibility with bios power options...
<lbv_user>	but couldn't find anything related
<ausseh>	error: you do not have permissions necessary to view the contents of "root".
<red-lichtie>	lbv_user: is a systemd service stuck?
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: pi2 is quite good
<ausseh>	i added myself in the sudoers file
<red-lichtie>	what does your last shutdown log say?
<viderizer>	menlo vs. monaco for a font+
<viderizer>	?*
<demonicmaniac3>	earnestly: eh.... well. no :p
<demonicmaniac3>	the gpu is still the same
<lbv_user>	red-lichtie: not that it warns me... i don't have the logs here... :\
<demonicmaniac3>	and 700mhz a7 is also quite meh
<lbv_user>	red-lichtie: i think it halts because the caret stops blinking
<namarrgon>	ausseh: what are you trying to do?
<demonicmaniac3>	i'd take a bananpi over the pi2 any day
<ausseh>	 view the contents of the "root" folder in gui
<red-lichtie>	rpi2 is an awesome little credit card computer that fixes "most" of the problems with the original model
<namarrgon>	ausseh: why?
<ausseh>	finding where a program was installed with wine
<d_garbage>	ausseh, sudo doesn't affect groups afaik
<namarrgon>	ausseh: nothing gets ever installed in /root
<namarrgon>	ausseh: wine usually installs in your user's ~
<d_garbage>	/root it root's home
<ausseh>	any suggestions as to where it may have installed? i know it makes something similar to a windows c: drive.
<red-lichtie>	lbv_user: wake on lan or anything like that going on?
<monoide>	ausseh: look into ~/.wine
<d_garbage>	~/.wine usually
<red-lichtie>	lbv_user: you have to check out the logs of your last logoout
<d_garbage>	with a prefix can be anywhere
<ausseh>	just search for ~/.wine? i know how to get there via cmd line, but not gui
<lbv_user>	red-lichtie: no wol afaik... yes i'll see monday the shutdown logs...
<red-lichtie>	my old system had problems with switcharoo on shutdown that cause kernel panics and stuff
<namarrgon>	ausseh: what gui are we talking about?
<lbv_user>	red-lichtie: where they are usually set? /var/log/?
<demonicmaniac3>	red-lichtie: not when there's models around that can decode h265
<red-lichtie>	journalctl
<demonicmaniac3>	the video/gpu on the pi2 is horribly bad
<lbv_user>	oh...
<demonicmaniac3>	the cpu is at least bearable but it's still damn slow
<lbv_user>	red-lichtie: it complains a little about a usb as it had a broken cable, but the computer is brand new... also, while it is working that doesn't seem a problem at all
<demonicmaniac3>	and let's not forget bananapi has sata port
<demonicmaniac3>	and gigabit ethernet
<keenerd>	if you want sata and gigabit on the cheap, go with a pogoplug.
<red-lichtie>	your system might be trying to stop a service that is stuck in wait, until you check out your logs everything else is conjecture
<lbv_user>	i see, red-lichtie, thanks for the directions :d
<red-lichtie>	demonicmaniac3: those are the winners, sata and gigabit
<cloudef>	vodik: the data url is url, not fs. though fs layout is similar on server. for bottle vs. flask, no reason i've just used bottle more as it's easier to get run on crappy servers
<lbv_user>	another weird thing about that computer is that it wouldn't boot through pxe... it finds everything, but doesn't start grub :\
<red-lichtie>	demonicmaniac3: now they need the quad-core of the pi2
<red-lichtie>	oh, and usb3 :-d
<demonicmaniac3>	red-lichtie: hahahahahaha
<vodik>	cloudef: yeah, i figured it out, i got two of my projects building
<demonicmaniac3>	as if the pi2 even achieves usb2 speeds on the usb3 port
<demonicmaniac3>	funnay
<demonicmaniac3>	and the bananapro/m2 has quad core cortex a7
<demonicmaniac3>	just being quadcore doesn't help for all single threaded loads
<red-lichtie>	what do they go for?
<red-lichtie>	treu, very true
<vodik>	cloudef: to reask my easier question, any reason for bottle over flask? all i know about bottle is that its similar
<demonicmaniac3>	it's not like you'll be running anything cpu intensive actually profiting from many threads on a pi2 anyway
<cloudef>	vodik: read my message again :p
<spoonfeedme>	hello
<demonicmaniac3>	you still can't decode any video on it that's not hw decoded by the gpu with those cpu spoeeds
<demonicmaniac3>	like 720 h265 no fecking way :p
<red-lichtie>	demonicmaniac3: i don't know, i use it as a silent desktop alternative
<vodik>	cloudef: ah, heh
<vodik>	sorry
<red-lichtie>	the gpu does h264, which covers most material
<vodik>	cloudef: well looks good thus far
<st33med>	ugh, i can't figure out how to get grub working under an efi system.
<demonicmaniac3>	red-lichtie: the gpu does some h264 profiles
<st33med>	i am using a vm
<demonicmaniac3>	by far not all
<demonicmaniac3>	depending on bframes and no 10bit material at all
<demonicmaniac3>	and no vp8/9 or h265
<namarrgon>	st33med: which vm?
<st33med>	microsoft's hyper-v
<namarrgon>	it does support uefi?
<st33med>	i thought it did
<namarrgon>	"efivar -l" returns what?
<viderizer>	why can't there be any decent ssh client for window
<viderizer>	they are all super ugly
<st33med>	namarrgon, nothing
<sheep>	viderizer: and, iirc, they all are missing support for recent features of openssh like ed25519 and ecdsa keys and the gcm ciphers
<namarrgon>	st33med: is efivarfs mounted?
<st33med>	namarrgon, error listing variables, function not implemented
<st33med>	how do i check?
<yomisei>	viderizer: mobaxterm?
<namarrgon>	st33med: findmnt efivarfs
<viderizer>	i will try that, yomisei
<lbv_user>	one more question... when i do `mount -t iso9660 -o loop file.iso /mount/point` it doesnt mount anymore... how to fix that?
<st33med>	namarrgon, nothing.
<red-lichtie>	demonicmaniac3: fair enough but what it can do for the price (full hd) is impressive. that is why it became the card/computer of choice for xbmc (raspbmc and openelec)
<yomisei>	bitvise looks quite good as well, but it's not as fleshed out as moba is
<sheep>	lbv_user: what error message do you get?
<namarrgon>	st33med: ls /sys/firmware/efi
<lbv_user>	sheep: none, it only warns it is mounting read only
<d_garbage>	!errormsg
<earnestly>	red-lichtie: it become popular because it was one of the first which became widely known
<phrik>	post the _exact_, _verbatim_ error message. paraphrasing, reciting from memory, or otherwise being vague will earn you a swift boot to the head.
<sheep>	lbv_user: does it actually mount it to /mount/point ?
<st33med>	namarrgon, no such file or directory
<namarrgon>	st33med: then it's not enabled for the vm
<lbv_user>	sheep: no. nothing in the output of `mount` and nothing on losetup --list
<demonicmaniac3>	red-lichtie: especially xbmc is unbearable with a pi1 at least
<st33med>	namarrgon, i just looked it up, no uefi. oh wellz
<sheep>	weird
<red-lichtie>	i guess it proved that there even was a market for soc boards
<sheep>	lbv_user: try using losetup to set up a loop device for the iso, then mount that?
<viderizer>	mobaxterm is proprietary ;_;
<demonicmaniac3>	nah. it existed before
<demonicmaniac3>	thousands of mele and friends "video players"
<lbv_user>	dmesg gives me `loop: module loaded` and `iso 9660 extensions: rrip_1991a`
<demonicmaniac3>	in the 70 to 100 dollars range in a box with a hdd inside and what not
<demonicmaniac3>	running custom androids for the most part
<st33med>	namarrgon, i don't think i will be missing any benefits for not using uefi
<demonicmaniac3>	the popcorn box is also much older than the pi
<lbv_user>	sheep: i'll try again, but last time i got the loop device but not mounted the same...
<namarrgon>	st33med: in a vm it doesn't really matter that much
<st33med>	yep
<red-lichtie>	you actually end up spending that much on a pi anyway, after getting the (micro)sdhc card, the case and the external power supply
<demonicmaniac3>	yup
<demonicmaniac3>	what the pi proved is that people spend 35 bucks eagerly
<demonicmaniac3>	for a paperweight
<demonicmaniac3>	:)
<st33med>	namarrgon, this is my first time messing with linux in awhile, and decided to head in face first with arch on a vm
<demonicmaniac3>	of the people who bought a pi i know most haven't used it for more than a month if at all
<st33med>	so, yeah :d
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: i got mine for free and haven't used it
<demonicmaniac3>	or ask around for what they might possibly do with it - some relegated it to graphing temps in their room..
<st33med>	demonicmaniac3, they sound cool, but i can't think of a good use
<lbv_user>	sheep: losetup --list give me a sizelimit=0... is that normal?
<demonicmaniac3>	heh ya
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: but might turn it into a smb fileserver.  already did a poc
<red-lichtie>	most of the pis i have or have set up run xbmc
<sheep>	lbv_user: idk
<red-lichtie>	i use bbbs for networking
<demonicmaniac3>	earnestly: wooooo with them wooping 4mb/s transfer rawr
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: obviously a bananapi with sata would be the upgrade if it works
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: yeah, 4mb/s is good enough for a start
<earnestly>	sucks, but workable
<dacoit>	qq
<lbv_user>	sheep: setting up the loop device and mounting it works...
<spartan-s63>	i'm having an issue where gdm goes on a login loop every time i try to log in. i'm not sure what's causing it and i've tried reinstalling gdm but to no avail. i found a couple posts talking about an ~/.xsession-errors file, but i don't have that in my home directory. anyone have any ideas how to resolve the issue? i've also checked file permissions too.
<lbv_user>	seems to me a problem with the loop option in the mount...
<demonicmaniac3>	earnestly: i don't see the point - for a bananapi there
<demonicmaniac3>	get a 2 bay nas you can put archlinux on
<demonicmaniac3>	with hotswap and raid and all that jazz
<braindamage>	i have raid with my cubieboard
<demonicmaniac3>	considering a case and power supply for the disks and everything else a 2 bay nas isn't any more expensive
<demonicmaniac3>	even cheaper usually
<braindamage>	it's pretty much identical tothe bananapi in terms of hw
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: boring
<braindamage>	i just added a sata port multiplier and patched kernel slight
<namarrgon>	spartan-s63: what wm/de are you trying to login to?
<spartan-s63>	namarrgon: gnome
<namarrgon>	spartan-s63: can you start gnome via xinitrc/startx?
<cirrus_minor>	spartan-s63 ➤    this is why i much prefer using startx | ~.xinitrc to manage sessions, login managers seem to cause more trouble that they're worth
<braindamage>	i have ~8mb/s transfer speed trough sshfs, both sides using ssh-hpn
<braindamage>	raid 5 over 4 disks
<spartan-s63>	namarrgon: last i checked, i couldn't. let me try again.
<red-lichtie>	but does the sata have a port multiplier?!?!?! for the ultimate storage server? :-d
<louisdk>	why do someone put firefox extensions and gnome shell extensions in aur. i guess it's only for system wide configuration. isn't it easier if it's just updated by the user in the app?
<demonicmaniac3>	earnestly: *shrugs* i'd want raid for any fileserver for sure
<braindamage>	red-lichtie: i am using a sata port multiplier
<demonicmaniac3>	and hotplug
<rena>	maybe so they can be included in a mass-install script?
<demonicmaniac3>	and wouldn't need any hdmi or stuffs
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: yeah, i'm not saying it's sensible
<red-lichtie>	braindamage: nice
<rena>	if you install firefox extensions from aur do they still auto update within firefox?
<braindamage>	howrever default kernel mode won't allow it, you need to patch few things
<rena>	also maybe some people trust aur more than mozilla addons repo? dunno
<red-lichtie>	main thing is that the hw allows it
<braindamage>	( at least for the allwinner a20 soc )
<braindamage>	yes, the hw allows it but it's mutually excluse with normal mode
<earnestly>	braindamage: will the kernel eventually alow it?
<braindamage>	so you have to patch things
<braindamage>	because default they setup single port
<earnestly>	(mainline)
<braindamage>	i read a mailing list entry about setting a flag for kernel params
<spartan-s63>	namarrgon: it appears i can't. startx fails. i'm trying to do a reinstall of gnome to see if something happened there.
<braindamage>	but i didn't check if it entered mainline
<namarrgon>	spartan-s63: post the xorg log
<braindamage>	sec
<namarrgon>	spartan-s63: randomly reinstalling packages doesn't fix anything
<louisdk>	rena, i think you shows as locked in firefox and you have to keep them updated by installing updated pkgbuild's.
<rena>	that would make sense, they're probably not writeable by firefox (which might be safer)
<rena>	i need to get around to setting up firefox to run as its own user too
<rena>	not super fond of the idea that if i picked up some malicious extension it has access to everything in ~
<rena>	(or some js exploit or etc)
<earnestly>	demonicmaniac3: btw, can you recommend one anyway?
<red-lichtie>	earnestly: i've read that the qnap ones are excellent
<braindamage>	earnestly: http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg377087.html
<phrik>	title: [patch] ahci_sunxi: drop ahci_hflag_no_pmp flag — arm, omap, xscale linux kernel (at www.spinics.net)
<braindamage>	see all the follow-ups
<braindamage>	i hate mailing list web interfaces so much, it's always so difficult to follow threads
<ackt1c>	indeed
<earnestly>	braindamage: looks like it has
<braindamage>	it's not that simple, see the whole thread
<amunak>	oh my god pxe boot is so cool
<earnestly>	braindamage: i like these uis personally
<earnestly>	if they can be done right
<amunak>	who even needs physical media to boot shit nowadays
<earnestly>	which this isn't really
<boblehest>	viderizer: indeed it is. :)
<earnestly>	braindamage: e.g. going to the thread index and no sign of the actual thread.
<braindamage>	i prefer viewing mailing lists trough web pages, but the existing ones always make me feel like i'm being euthanized
<boblehest>	i'm reinstalling firmware/software on three devices, time flies.
<earnestly>	so daft
<stickykhorne>	at ipv6 what is the second ip inthe netctl config for? address6=('1234:5678:9abc:def::1/64' '1234:3456::123/96')
<earnestly>	braindamage: oh well, it didn't go anywhere then
<earnestly>	(yet)
<sheep>	stickykhorne: it's an additional ip to put on the interface
<stickykhorne>	not recommended?
<sheep>	i think
<braindamage>	earnestly: currently i just rebuild without the option, not ideal, but works
<sheep>	you most likely only need one address
<stickykhorne>	ok thats good, thx
<braindamage>	i could submit a patch myself, but i dread thinking what good programmers would think of my code :p
<earnestly>	heh

<vodik>	`option ttytype=dumb` is the only bit of information it gets
<vodik>	no tty information
<tazmain>	hi all, i added some entries to my fstab but i have the noauto set, now in any file manager i don't see those drives. does anyone know how to fix this ?
<vodik>	so yeah, im going to kill it
<vodik>	tazmain: noauto doesn't magically make the harddrive show up
<tazmain>	vodik, it made it magically disappear from the drive list in my file managers is what i am saying
<vodik>	tazmain: its just a hack so you can run 'mount <mount point>' at some later point safely
<vodik>	tazmain: because its managed now and not part of your hotplugging
<vodik>	*not considered hot plugged
<tazmain>	dolphin still saw it though
<vodik>	depends on your file manager then
<tazmain>	its the only one
<vodik>	i mean, the semantics here aren't really well defined
<vodik>	tazmain: which one?
<tazmain>	but i don't trust phonon-qt4 anymore
<tazmain>	vodik, only dolphin saw them still, nautilus, pcmanfm , thunar doesn't see them
<lbv_user>	anyone else using firefox on kde? i'm noticing ff is glitching when it gets started with an url...
<tazmain>	lbv_user, i run ff on plasma though. not sure if that will help
<vodik>	tazmain: all the later use udisk2 as a backend, and i'm willing to bet it ignores anything defined in /etc/fstab
<vodik>	tazmain: since its meant for hotplugging

<tazmain>	or do you mean pavucontrol ?

<dynamicmetaflow>	trying to get the hang of everything and make some things work
<tazmain>	dynamicmetaflow, kdeconnect if you have android, its a must
<lbv_user>	oh nice, does anyone tried that pam-face-authentication?
<dynamicmetaflow>	i have an iphone unfortunately but thnak you though
<dynamicmetaflow>	anyone have any tips on hidpi
<dynamicmetaflow>	with plasma
<tazmain>	man this is messed up , in my settings for plasma i only see default for audio
<dynamicmetaflow>	i used to use ubuntu gnome but wanted to try something different so not everything is scaled for a 3200 x !800 resolution
<vodik>	earnestly: and i figured out whats up, for reals. the other thing was also a bug
<vodik>	heh
<vodik>	earnestly: so i have this logic to make sure we aren't execing ourselves, since if you have the symlink inside path, it can also show up during searching path
<earnestly>	symlinks *shakes fist*
<vodik>	earnestly: problem is, i have this short cut, if i get a full path as argv[0] (starts with a '/'), i try to just run that
<vodik>	i do have the same check there
<vodik>	but if someone tries to run the symlink with the full path, that code path triggers
<vodik>	and there's no fallback. the recursion check blocks the exec and we return without running the command
<vodik>	adding the fallback where we search path properly fixes this
<vodik>	so this should fix it, for the time being, while i explore other techniques
<vodik>	earnestly: this i think is promising: http://ix.io/isf
<earnestly>	vodik: you haven't commited this yet?  i'm not sure what you mean by fallback
<vodik>	earnestly: if (cmd[0] == '/') { do_safe_exec(command); }
<holomorph>	lol networkd fails if i disable ipv6
<vodik>	earnestly: now cmd comes from argv, and if cmd points to ourselves, eg: '~/.local/bin/ssh', because another tool ran the symlink with the fullpath, this breaks
<vodik>	holomorph: i solved it and fixed it
<holomorph>	vodik: symlinks are smrt again?
<vodik>	holomorph: no, but its fixable
<vodik>	corner cases
<vodik>	holomorph: i never tried running with a fullpath to the symlink
<earnestly>	symlinks are the king of corner cases
<vodik>	~/.local/bin/ssh won't work
<vodik>	earnestly: yeah
<st33med>	how do i make dhcpd start on boot?
<earnestly>	holomorph: http://ix.io/isd
<hseg>	ok. i've tracked the problem down to the build failing when gcc is called with -f{no-,}stack-protector{,-strong,-all} due to segfaults. when i don't touch stack-protector, the build succeeds.
<holomorph>	earnestly: yay ffi?
<st33med>	nvm
<earnestly>	holomorph: it builds and links
<ackt1c>	sudo systemctl enable dhcpcd.service
<hseg>	ideas?
<holomorph>	earnestly: woop!
<earnestly>	hseg: what?
<st33med>	thanks
<st33med>	thanks ackt1c
<ackt1c>	np
<holomorph>	clearly asked for dhcpd and not dhcpcd
<earnestly>	holomorph: segfaults, but the build is all that matters.  segfaults because wlc_init is not properly formed
<st33med>	holomorph, lol. typo :p
<ackt1c>	also systemctl start and stop and disable
<st33med>	yep yep yep
<st33med>	or i could join the dark side(tm) and use systemd >.>
<stickykhorne>	i deinstalled netctl and installed systemd.networkd and used /etc/systemd/network/wired.network http://pastebin.com/dqvtk1ju but it didn't work and i can' figure it out. i used 'systemctl start systemd-networkd.service' and 'systemctl start systemd-resolved.service'
<phrik>	title: [bash] wired.network - pastebin.com (at pastebin.com)
<earnestly>	holomorph: that is, in the code.  i don't know how to to create the struct needed
<earnestly>	holomorph: the struct that wlc_init expects
<hseg>	i've been trying to track down why a build is failing. i've been passing variants of the cflags makepkg passes by default. if i mention stack-protector, gcc throws a hissy fit. if i don't talk about it, gcc compiles the code fine.
<earnestly>	hseg: run very far away from that code

<earnestly>	hseg: that's shocking

<viderizer>	i've configured everything nice for root
<boblehest>	it literally takes an hour to update fedora 21 after a fresh install :/
<viderizer>	but i should probably make my own account before i destroy somthing
<boblehest>	guess i have some uninstalling to do right after it's done.
<earnestly>	hseg: the jpl uses static analysis heavily and even says "many programmers are fooled into thinking static analysis produces false positives, they should instead rewrite the code so no warnings trigger the analysis"
<spoonfeedme>	can i hide bar at the bottom on baka mplayer?
<earnestly>	hseg: they use c a lot for their various landers and probes, like curiosity.  a lot of it is generated though
<sledgehammer>	viderizer, why are you configuring _anything_ for root?
<earnestly>	hseg: see if you can find a copy of the jpl c coding standards somewhere
<earnestly>	hseg: anyway, scan-build is a great tool, along with callgrind/perf/cov
<earnestly>	and everyone should include it in their build systems
<earnestly>	(or some other kind of static analysis tool like c-frama or whatever)
<hseg>	huh. you learn something every day.
<homerj>	yeah, the stuff some of the people complain about with some of the analysis, just write it another way so it's happy
<hseg>	scan-build make cflags="-march=i686 -mtune=generic -o2 -pipe -fpic" reports scan-build: no bugs found.
<earnestly>	gprof2dot -f callgrind and callgrind is fun too
<homerj>	because the tools are good to use, and if you start to ignore errors it gives you, then why use it?
<viderizer>	sledgehammer: i didn't realize i was still root
<earnestly>	hseg: see if it blows up with stack now

<vodik>	fuck pinentry
<vodik>	and that's with a workaround that breaks it in other situations. if i don't have that workaround emacs just locks up instead
<holomorph>	vodik: rofl
<vodik>	holomorph: so i guess emacs shouldn't use the wrapper anyways
<vodik>	bug fixed or not
<holomorph>	vodik: at least in magit, you can set the git executable to envoy-exec and edit the git options to include '-- git'
<holomorph>	at least, that's my workaround
<earnestly>	vodik: lol
<earnestly>	it must do some pretty epic munging of the tty to do that
<vodik>	holomorph: set the executable to just /usr/bin/git and skip the wrapper. its broken unless you'll always have display set
<vodik>	holomorph: that ^ is with the fix
<holomorph>	vodik: but emacs vc doesn't have relevant tunables
<holomorph>	hm
<earnestly>	hseg: it's an ice, try clang :p
<holomorph>	vodik: do you mean because of something git does itself?
<vodik>	holomorph: no, gpg-agent
<holomorph>	rip
<earnestly>	hseg: and/or see if it happens with 5.0.1.  if it does, bug report to gcc i guess :s
<vodik>	speciacally gpg-agent ncurses
<vodik>	err
<vodik>	pinetnry-ncurses
<vodik>	its so broken
<vodik>	earnestly: you have no idea how broken it'll make your terminal if it shows up in the wrong place
<polyzen>	specifically or especially? :p
<vodik>	let me show you
<holomorph>	it pwns the tty
<spoonfeedme>	earnestly: shoow your dtop

<earnestly>	heh
<elocho>	does anyone know whether luks-lvm full disk encryption will drag down my fps when i'm gaming? would it be negligible or noticeable?
<polyzen>	shouldn't
<hseg>	earnestly: i'll check scan-build's output, see what i find.
<holomorph>	hseg: also maybe try using address sanitizer
<earnestly>	hseg: an ice is an internet compiler error.  it means gcc is fucked

<holomorph>	hseg: gcc 5.1, yes
<earnestly>	vodik: i am happy they offer the webm
<vodik>	earnestly: that corruption doesn't go away, it just breaks the terminal. you can't actually enter any commands that would reset it to a sane state
<vodik>	enter stops working predictibly
<vodik>	i have no idea what scary stuff it must be doing

<holomorph>	then i visited their tracker
<vodik>	earnestly: you can't type it in

<earnestly>	vodik: wow.
<vodik>	yeah, i hate it
<hseg>	whoa.
<holomorph>	let's read pinentry sauce
<earnestly>	vodik: that program should probably be nuked
<hseg>	yeah that sucks
<earnestly>	no one has made a sane alternative?
<earnestly>	(does no one want to do that? hehe)
<earnestly>	you'd think such a simple curses program wouldn't be so broken
<vodik>	earnestly: i want to write a replacement agent when kdbus lands. it just broadcasts over dbus for a pinentry and if there isn't one, bails gracefully
<earnestly>	kdbus might not happen
<earnestly>	it seems like dbus itself is really badly programmed
<vodik>	earnestly: then you have something like 'pkttyagent' if you want a terminal prompt
<earnestly>	that is, when asked, they had no benchmarks or data to provide.
<holomorph>	call it kbus and ship it, no one will know
<earnestly>	someone wrote a lame benchmark and saw almost no real improvement.  so now all the kernel devs are telling them to fix dbus in userspace before thinking they need it in the kernel
<vodik>	earnestly: yeah i followed that. i'm not super optimistic but i do think something will land, even if its back to the drawing boards for the current impl
<vodik>	earnestly: i want the sd-bus library mainly
<vodik>	its really nice
<earnestly>	vodik: i hope it means they'll rethink dbus and apply some good old programming science to the problem
<vodik>	yeah
<earnestly>	like measuring performance, using tools to find bottlenecks, etc.
<earnestly>	context switching on linux is not that expensive all things considered
<vodik>	but seriously, libdbus1 api is insanely verbose. sd-bus is so much less code and cleaner
<vodik>	yeah
<earnestly>	yeah, their api is nicer
<vodik>	earnestly: its not like the memfd stuff can't be used from userspace either
<earnestly>	and it doesn't have dependencies on silly libraries like glib
<vodik>	which no matter what happens of kdbus, at least we get that
<earnestly>	or qt even, just for qdbus or gdbus
<vodik>	thats an excuse from shitty programmers, im convinced
<vodik>	'we did a crap job, so we're just going to recommend you don't use our library'
<vodik>	there's an awesome complexity quote i just read a few days ago
<vodik>	lets see if i can find it
<vodik>	gah
<earnestly>	also home/.dbus is part of the spec ._.
<demize>	earnestly: the "benchmark" which linus complained about being so slow was using glib, and the functions he showed that took a long time were all glib ones, which made me really rather annoyed..
<pablotron>	benchmarking in general is so.... biased?
<pablotron>	arbitrary.
<vodik>	anyways, i'll brb
<earnestly>	nope
<demize>	but yeah, they should have written some proper benchmarks and documented some cases where it would provide real improvements today, instead of going "it's needed and it'll be faster!" whenever it was brought up
<vodik>	or i got 5 actually
<earnestly>	demize: glib is a poorly designed library that doesn't really take into account the machine.  it also uses what's known as "disney dollar" api where they basically just rename standard types for giggles
<pablotron>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmv_hwtsth0
<zombiefied>	can anyone use use pacman right now?
<earnestly>	demize: it implements oo, what do you expect?
<demize>	earnestly: yeah, i know, that's why i was so annoyed when i saw that they used it for the "benchmark"
<demize>	glib does have some useful things, but... yeah..
<zombiefied>	why did pacman stop working :c
<zombiefied>	so sad
<demize>	like, want to uppercase a utf-8 string stored as a null terminated char*? good luck if you don't want to use glib!
<earnestly>	demize: i don't really think their claims have much basis anyway.  kernel context switching isn't great, their need to support "legacy" in kdbus is silly (the kernel is the legacy, forever, you don't want to put badness into it before it has a chance)
<demize>	!give zombiefied errormsg
<phrik>	zombiefied: post the _exact_, _verbatim_ error message. paraphrasing, reciting from memory, or otherwise being vague will earn you a swift boot to the head.
<earnestly>	switching isn't that bad*
<zombiefied>	@demize wat?
<demize>	earnestly: yeah
<earnestly>	demize: and 1000x performance increases?  that's a big claim and needs big evidence
<demize>	indeed
<zombiefied>	ok
<demize>	i guess the in-the-kernel-for-early-boot and such is mostly reasonable, but meh.
<cloudef>	is there link for what you are talking about
<zombiefied>	it just cant download from any mirror, and gives me a 404
<earnestly>	demize: i think, if they can really get dbus nice and effecient, it might not even need more kernel cruft

<ackt1c>	no
<rena>	!anyone
<phrik>	nope, just you
<voidead>	!anyone2
<phrik>	no.
<trevir>	i thinks it would be default for the color
<nando293921>	no, not on newsbeuter.
<ackt1c>	i run a little rss site if you're interested
<d_garbage>	ausseh, try knemo
<nando293921>	hey, anybody notice that on mpsyt youtube terminal client that the serch function isn't returing any hits except for one.
<d_garbage>	youtube recently re-jigged it's api
<d_garbage>	probably broke a few things
<nando293921>	ok thanks.
<ch_ris>	yep i've figured it out. my desktop's hard drive is dying
<ackt1c>	bummer
<ch_ris>	least i have 3 more.. but the're smaller
<ch_ris>	250gb
<ackt1c>	ssd?
<ch_ris>	hdd
<d_garbage>	get data off of it straight away
<ch_ris>	i have all my crap on a second hard drive
<ch_ris>	a wd black
<d_garbage>	it might last for ages but once they start to go they can fail instantly at any time
<spoonfeedme>	how do you watch yt on qutebrowser?
<ch_ris>	this is the first time i've have had a hdd die in me
<spoonfeedme>	d_garbage: feed me
<d_garbage>	i just did
<ch_ris>	i think it's dying. but i will check s.m.a.r.t using a xubuntu live cd
<ch_ris>	just to be safe
<spoonfeedme>	d_garbage: no you didn't, no answer wtf
<d_garbage>	spoonfeedme, also the joke isn't that funny and going to get old real fast

<d_garbage>	yes, i recognised the serial

<d_garbage>	i;m telling you something for your benefit and that of anyone else who happens to be listening?
<d_garbage>	makes no difference to me
<d_garbage>	also sprunge, ix and ptpb are especially useful if you want to paste directly from the terminal
<d_garbage>	!sprunge
<phrik>	pipe or redirect your command or file into `curl -f 'sprunge=<-' sprunge.us`. this will upload to sprunge.us and return a link to the paste.
<spoonfeedme>	better torrent client?
<holomorph>	better google skills
<holomorph>	oh
<holomorph>	it's this hyo idiot
<szt>	does arch ship with a different rename ?
<szt>	mine can't use perl style regex
<sudokode>	szt: perl style regex?
<szt>	yeah
<szt>	s/this/that/ stuff
<sudokode>	didn't realize rename ever did that
<sudokode>	also, that's just regex..
<szt>	according to this site
<szt>	http://www.tecmint.com/rename-multiple-files-in-linux/
<phrik>	title: rename – a command line tool for renaming multiple files in linux (at www.tecmint.com)
<szt>	it does
<szt>	well i need to append .mp4 to multiple files
<szt>	what would you use?
<sudokode>	that page is completely inaccurate
<szt>	well how would you do it?
<sudokode>	the way rename supports
<sudokode>	wildcards
<szt>	show me an example please
<sudokode>	the manpage has some good examples
<sudokode>	[23:25] tim ~ $ touch foo1 foo2 foo3 ; ls foo? ; rename foo bar foo? ; ls bar?
<sudokode>	foo1  foo2  foo3
<sudokode>	bar1  bar2  bar3
<szt>	yeah
<szt>	well
<szt>	that doesn't tell me how to append something to all files
<szt>	i can't use groups in there can i?
<szt>	i don't want to replace like htm with html or something
<szt>	that manpage gives very little information really
<sudokode>	!shrug2
<phrik>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<sudokode>	you could script it
<sudokode>	suffix='foo'; for i in *; do mv "$i" "$i$suffix"; done
<hugomg>	i have  a bunch of files in a folder named "author-title-year.pdf". what shell one-liner can i use to print all the titles?
<sudokode>	awk -f '-
<sudokode>	er
<cl4p-tp>	anyone know exactly how to add a widget in awesome wm? im getting errors when i try to add the widget in the wibox
<sudokode>	awk -f '-' '{print $2}'
<keenerd>	hugomg: is it a safe assumption that none of the titles have hypens?
<hugomg>	yes, its a safe assumption
<trevir>	how about *.mp4
<hugomg>	and what if instead of a separator, i have a regex?
<hugomg>	say filenames are foonn.txt, and i want the nn which are numbers
<sudokode>	or just use the awk expression i posted
<sudokode>	but yeah, you can't have any hyphens in the title

<ch_ris>	just asking how long is a conveyance self test
<d_garbage>	depends, fairly 'long'
<d_garbage>	in the order of many hours for a large drive
<ch_ris>	how about compared to extended
<d_garbage>	ask google?
<ch_ris>	ok
<d_garbage>	it's not going to be quick for a large drive
<d_garbage>	besides there's not much point testing it. if there are any errors at all then the drive cannot be trusted and you shout stop using it
<d_garbage>	stop*
<d_garbage>	at least for anything important or that needs to be reliable
<ch_ris>	it's going pretty fast for the test anyways
<ch_ris>	down at 50%
<d_garbage>	once a disk shows signs of failure it's useless
<ch_ris>	i will swap the hdd out of it when it's day time
<d_garbage>	because it will have already done everything it can to fix itself before showing errors
<ch_ris>	well i'm assuming that the drive is dying because grub said the partition is unknown
<ch_ris>	should i be worried if the drive has one bad sector
<d_garbage>	probably, yes
<d_garbage>	like i said on modern drives you wont see any error until things are already very bad
<szt>	conveyance?
<d_garbage>	they have so much built in self correction
<szt>	there's long short and conveyance?
<szt>	right?
<szt>	or long == conveyance?
<ch_ris>	the conveyance self-test: conveyance self-test is intended to identify damage incurred during transporting of the drive.
<szt>	hm okay
<ch_ris>	4487 starts and stops. on the drive
<d_garbage>	anyway like i said, smartctl -a <drive> and look for things like 'pending' and 'offline uncorrectable' sectors
<ch_ris>	i am using the gnome-disk-utility on the xubuntu live
<d_garbage>	it's all pretty vague anyway, google have done some studies of disk failure have a read of them. the general conclusion is smart/test results are very hard to predict time-to-failure with but that once a disk shows any errors at all it's "sooner rather than later" on average
<st33med>	i'm struggling trying to get vmware to play nice with arch. it won't enable unity mode
<st33med>	i have vmwgfx enabled
<d_garbage>	vmware has long had problems on arch
<st33med>	:\
<d_garbage>	the general advice is "use something else"
<st33med>	what's recommended for a windows host?
<d_garbage>	it's not like there are many options
<d_garbage>	virtualbox or qemu/kvm
<d_garbage>	wait, 'host'?
<st33med>	yes
<st33med>	windows is the host of the virtual machine
<d_garbage>	if it's an arch guest on windows host you might have wanted to say, "... arch to play nice with vmware"
<st33med>	yes
<d_garbage>	because that's a different kettle of fish
<st33med>	whichever... it never seems to want to get arch running with vmtools enabled
<d_garbage>	also i didn't know 'arch' had a 'unity mode', what is that, gnome?
<st33med>	nononon
<jeromelanteri>	where can find acs patch for kernel ? my device nvidia gtx750 is not view by iommu...
<jeromelanteri>	i think i need this, but never find information on how to find it
<herrera>	 /
<st33med>	unity mode as in every window is shared and displayed in the host machine as it's own pseudo window, d_garbage
<d_garbage>	ah, right. virtualbox has something similar, gotcha now
<d_garbage>	did you pay for it? ask customer support?
<st33med>	oh right... there is customer support for this stuff
<d_garbage>	should be
<st33med>	i have a student license
<jeromelanteri>	i arrived make running qemu/kvm and guest windows 7, but i pain to make running pci passthrough my nvidia gtx750. could you help me please ?
<st33med>	it's 'free' to me because uni
<d_garbage>	grats
<d_garbage>	free is always a good price :)
<st33med>	yah
<d_garbage>	st33med, do you get any kind of error messages?
<d_garbage>	any idea where the problem lies?
<st33med>	nah. i have the mesa and vmware drivers installed, enlightenment running, but it won't resize the desktop or enter unity mode
<d_garbage>	i suppose you could check xorg log maybe?
<st33med>	d_garbage, where would that b
<jeromelanteri>	st33med: wich vmware workstation ?
<st33med>	be
<st33med>	jeromelanteri, 11
<jeromelanteri>	i have it and make running windows 7 on it.
<st33med>	opposite for me
<d_garbage>	!give st33med xorg log
<phrik>	st33med: xorg's log can be found in one of several places: the system journal (gdm), /var/log/ (root), $home/.local/share/xorg/ (rootless) - take your pick
<jeromelanteri>	what is exactly the problem ? vlware installed and running or not ?
<st33med>	i can't get the vmware guest tools to run.
<st33med>	taht is
<st33med>	it won't do graphical unity mode or communicate with vmware
<jeromelanteri>	but vmware and your guest windows are running fine ?
<st33med>	i understand that the file sharing feature is broken for the moment though without compiling
<st33med>	yep
<jeromelanteri>	you have an iso images of the tools ?
<jeromelanteri>	i remember there is one on wmware web site... then you can make it running by vmware directly from your guest openned
<jeromelanteri>	i did it.
<st33med>	there are the open source tools and the tools you can install via virtual disk
<st33med>	both of them should work the same though...
<jeromelanteri>	and what the console tell you ?
<jeromelanteri>	could you run vmware by console for check that ?
<jeromelanteri>	or maybe look at the log files (i think need to config the debug messages to full in vmware
<st33med>	i dunno... it would seem to be guest side and not host side?
<jeromelanteri>	st33med: you need to see some error messages for have an idea of what's happen right ?
<jeromelanteri>	so... run vmware workstation from console and/or in the config part of workstation, you can also tell him to open debug messages at different level deep...
<st33med>	i looked at xorg, it's loading everything fin
<st33med>	*fine
<jeromelanteri>	then, logicaly, this debug params could give you logs messages files around that at the time you try to mount tools.
<st33med>	egggghghhhhh
<st33med>	headache from trying to get this all to work right.
<mnathani_>	i am not seeing my mouse cursor change when hovering over a link. what package could i be missing? i am running google chrome on gnome
<jeromelanteri>	i think xorg is something different around your problem...
<mnathani_>	jeromelanteri: was that directed at me?
<st33med>	no me
<jeromelanteri>	mnathani: nothing, it was for st33med
<mnathani_>	k
<sudokode>	!zoidberg
<phrik>	why not zoidberg? (\/)_(o„„o)_(\/)
<jeromelanteri>	mnathani: my mouse never change too... but... for me it's ok.
<jeromelanteri>	mnathani: sorry, yes, the pointer change oon hover link... but i'm not with chrome
<d_garbage>	st33med, you could just try virtualbox
<st33med>	it's such a pain to set up arch for me for some reason. so many options, setup, lack of clear direction
<st33med>	true
<pablotron>	that was hard too
<pablotron>	virtualbox
<jeromelanteri>	st33med: you can also try qemu/kvm
<d_garbage>	st33med, there are articles on the wiki for these things
<st33med>	that's more command line isn't it?
<d_garbage>	no
<st33med>	d_garbage, that's what i've been reading
<jeromelanteri>	st33med: not really, there is a little bit first, but there is some great virtual-manager gui
<st33med>	i have to dig around a lot to get something
<jeromelanteri>	just for make it running, it was not a pain for me (and i have a little head)
<d_garbage>	st33med, ah, just try vb it will probably work
<pablotron>	i was reading on how to use an existing arch install in virtualbox in windows... sheesh
<neuroserpens>	alright. before the smartest ones direct me to the wiki, i have tried everything there. it just doesn't have a clear answer to what i'm trying to do. now to the question: my current setup has a server machine which connects to the internet through my laptop's shared connection. i want to create a netctl profile that will be enable on boot in this server machine but i think i'm having trouble with dns
<neuroserpens>	resolving and maybe the route... here is my profile http://pastie.org/10180700
<phrik>	title: #10180700 - pastie (at pastie.org)
<st33med>	-_- i'm already suffering a headache from trying all of it. i may just try a dual boot or some other linux distro
<jeromelanteri>	for me, i remember virtualbox had some problem with graphic card and for give me max resolution on my screen
<d_garbage>	!give neuroserpens rtfw
<phrik>	neuroserpens: read the fine wiki. <https://wiki.archlinux.org/>
<d_garbage>	couldn't resist
<jeromelanteri>	st33med: you can, but i trtt a lot of distro, and archlinux is really on the adge for many thinks...
<neuroserpens>	d_garbage: smart ass
<d_garbage>	yup
<jeromelanteri>	is there someone here (with big head) who can help me pake running my gtx750 nvidia graphic cards passthrough on qemu/kvm ?
<st33med>	well i have it running, but i think what's giving me the most pain is running enlightenment, so, switching off that
<d_garbage>	on the existing evidence? no
<jeromelanteri>	i have the onboard intel xeon running fine on linux (gtx750 running fine too), and i just want to use gtx750 for only vm guest
<jeromelanteri>	st33med: it is a choice. but for me, if vmware was able to passthrough my graphic card, i keep it... because very happy with vmware. so... i see now qemu/kvm works very good (maybe better).
<jeromelanteri>	i just pain same you for do something (because my lake of knows)
<jeromelanteri>	but in fact, if it is possible, it is just a question of time to understand / find someone could explain you what you can not understand alone / find the solution.
<jeromelanteri>	st33med: but again, if you not have any error log messages or error messages to provide, it could be very difficult to find a solution. so maybe the first way could be to see an error message around your problem.
<holomorph>	vodik: nice fix
<d_garbage>	jeromelanteri, maybe you already saw this 2 year running thread on pass through? https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=162768

<jeromelanteri>	d_garbage: yes, it is exaclty the link i follow to do it.
<d_garbage>	thought so
<d_garbage>	oh well
<jeromelanteri>	but i have some issue not listed here
<d_garbage>	did you ask in the thread?
<jeromelanteri>	and find some around that, but not really understand all...
<jeromelanteri>	no... it is a good idea.
<dynamicmetaflow>	ok read the rules, thank you
<d_garbage>	dynamicmetaflow, good for you, you're welcome. it's not so much about 'rules' as much as helpful advice anyway
<dynamicmetaflow>	yes i understand
<dynamicmetaflow>	i've had quite a day setting everything up
<d_garbage>	grats
<dynamicmetaflow>	but it was fun although i still have a lot more to do
<dynamicmetaflow>	running kde plasma 5
<d_garbage>	it's quite quiet at the moment, usually it's a lot more busy
<cgm616>	i'm having problems starting xserver
<dynamicmetaflow>	ah i see
<reisio>	cgm616: problems, oh dear
<cgm616>	im on a macbook pro, and it complains that it can't initialize the nvidia gpu at pci
<d_garbage>	!give cgm616 problem
<phrik>	cgm616: please try to define the problem as clearly as you can, so: what do you want to do, what did you try and what was the result?

<d_garbage>	paste*
<dynamicmetaflow>	i have one question if someone would guide me. i am trying to blacklist a module specifically the "ideapad_laptop" module from the lenovo yoga 2 pro. i've done it before on ubuntu but not sure how to go about it on arch. this url from the wiki provides some information, https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/lenovo_ideapad_yoga_2_pro
<phrik>	title: lenovo ideapad yoga 2 pro - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)

<dacoit>	i thought it was dumb
<holomorph>	same
<sudokode>	dacoit: you think everything is dumb
<neuroserpens>	so... my current setup has a server machine which connects to the internet through my laptop's shared connection. i want to create a netctl profile that will be enabled on boot in this server machine but i think i'm having trouble with dns resolving. here is my netctl profile http://pastie.org/10180700

<sudokode>	no no
<sudokode>	wait for me
<d_garbage>	meh, ship would make more sense
<sudokode>	-offtopic for spoilers

<cgm616>	i'm on the afflicted machine right now, so one sec
<d_garbage>	train needs to much infrastructure
<sudokode>	no one wants that
<d_garbage>	too*
<sudokode>	alright, enough premise revision
<d_garbage>	lol
<d_garbage>	yeah, it's a movie right?
<dacoit>	post apocalyptic world where the entire population lives on a big train :|
<permagreen>	well, it was supposed to be a luxury train for the superrich before the end of the world happened
<d_garbage>	right
<permagreen>	it is a silly premise, but everything about it is well executed
<d_garbage>	we should be used to silly concepts by now
<sudokode>	dacoit: as opposed to post-apocalyptic world where the entire population lives on a big rock?
<d_garbage>	lol
<sudokode>	plus train makes it slightly steampunky
<dacoit>	sudokode: rocks exist without much effort. they're just rocks, the earths lousy with em
<sudokode>	that can only improve the cinematography
<d_garbage>	movies have always been incredibly bad for any kind of hard science fiction
<sudokode>	dacoit: what?
<jeromelanteri>	d_garbage: ok... i miss the linux-virtio package (but my kernel has virtio... so i think it is a special package to add), but the pgp of the package failed...
<reisio>	mmm
<sudokode>	you clearly don't understand how rocks work
<reisio>	i know, let's make a scifi film about people sitting on irc late at night

<d_garbage>	movies are insanely expensive to make
<jeromelanteri>	i not understand how to make a package pass with a wrong pgp key... coudl you help ?
<holomorph>	rofl this trailer
<d_garbage>	that's why they end up making such ridiculous compromises
<reisio>	insanely expensive ones are, anyway
<reisio>	how much did primer cost, again?
<reisio>	utterly absurd
<reisio>	fucking enjoyable to watch
<reisio>	now diaf :p
<reisio>	their time machine was a box
<reisio>	d-i-a-f
<d_garbage>	i haven't watched a new movie for many years now
<permagreen>	it's also a matter of time. movies have about about two hours (give or take) to setup and resolve all their plot threads. realism kind of trips up the pacing there, no matter what you're going for
<reisio>	d_garbage: then stop commenting like you're playing the same game the rest of us are
<d_garbage>	i think "wall-e" was the last one
<jeromelanteri>	for exemple, if i delete the two lines on pkgbuild: sha256sums and validgpgkey... could it compil ?
<reisio>	wall-e was great
<cgm616>	okay, i'm back
<d_garbage>	reisio, i'm not sure what you mean but don't particularly like the sound of it
<sudokode>	d_garbage: oh yeah, i saw this trailer when i saw...
<sudokode>	uhhh
<jeromelanteri>	welcome back
<sudokode>	american sniper i think
<permagreen>	jeromelanteri, i believe so. i think you can also just tell makepkg to ignore those checks
<reisio>	d_garbage: cool
<sudokode>	d_garbage: also the trailer gives away the climax
<d_garbage>	don't delete checks, fix them properly
<sudokode>	literally shows you who is last to survive
<d_garbage>	sudokode, that sounds a bit silly?
<sudokode>	i guess the mystery is if she does or not
<sudokode>	d_garbage: i dunno. i think it's an interesting premise
<sudokode>	it pulls from a classic revenge style
<holomorph>	im in ur nervis system hackin ur brainz
<cgm616>	d_garbage: xorg.0.log is here: http://pastebin.com/sfmp5nw0

<sudokode>	or -still
<sudokode>	still was the sequel
<d_garbage>	cgm616, you probably want to avoid pastebin.com, some people can't open it

<mnathani_>	st33med: have you heard of vagrant
<d_garbage>	there you go
<cgm616>	what about ghostbin?
<jeromelanteri>	permagreen: delete lines pkgbuild file not works... how to tell makepkg to ignore that pgp keys ?
<mnathani_>	with a few commands you can have a functioning virtualbox instance of archlinux
<d_garbage>	something simple without js for preference
<sudokode>	d_garbage: i mean true horror is pretty much dead

<d_garbage>	i scare too easily
<jeromelanteri>	permagreen: on yaourt command line ?
<reisio>	then you're missing the point
<reisio>	which is: to be scared
<sudokode>	lol
<sudokode>	derp
<reisio>	i bet you don't ride rollercoasters, either
<d_garbage>	life is scary enough
<reisio>	yeah but life is free
<sudokode>	but you don't want life to be scary
<permagreen>	jeromelanteri, not sure, try it and see if it works
<dacoit>	have you seen cabin in the woods. pretty funny meta movie :)
<d_garbage>	no, it's incredibly expensive in my experience
<jeromelanteri>	d_garbage: not in the thailand counrty... life is really good here
<sudokode>	but your morbid curiosity makes you wanna experience fear without danger
<d_garbage>	lucky for you?
<sudokode>	cause your brain is a fucked up blob of cells
<d_garbage>	lol
<dacoit>	aka. glioblastoma
<reisio>	that is a funny movie
<reisio>	and it has girls in their under

<sudokode>	reisio: unfriended?
<sudokode>	already out?

<sudokode>	oh that's a stupid fuckin movie
<d_garbage>	\o/
<dacoit>	he he i loved it
<reisio>	yeah but it's stupid on purpose
<sudokode>	i can't believe anyone thought cabin in the woods was intelligent
<reisio>	nobody did
<sudokode>	no it's not
<cgm616>	here is my xorg log: https://ghostbin.com/paste/zaowd , here is my dmesg grepped for nvidia: https://ghostbin.com/paste/vhazr

<sudokode>	nooo
<sudokode>	wtf
<sudokode>	no
<reisio>	yup
<reisio>	it is
<sudokode>	don't give it credit
<reisio>	that doesn't make it intelligent
<sudokode>	no
<reisio>	it just makes it stupid on purpose
<sudokode>	it's not fuckin scream
<d_garbage>	i watched john carpenter's version of "the thing" once, long ago. that was amazing but pretty scary
<sudokode>	it didn't do it on purpose
<reisio>	sure it did
<d_garbage>	had nightmares for weeks afterwards
<dacoit>	... the scene where the japanese kids sing the grudge girl away.. lol i was in tears
<reisio>	scream was better, but they both tried it on purpose
<sudokode>	it tried to make what were classically stupid characters into smart characters while insulting the intelligence of the audience
<reisio>	nah
<reisio>	it was a dumb movie, on purpose
<sudokode>	and then throwing in ridiculous twists
<sudokode>	nooo
<reisio>	yarp
<sudokode>	no nononoonon
<sudokode>	i can't allow this injustice to stand
<dacoit>	man!
<reisio>	just because something was dumb on purpose doesn't mean it's some kind of wonderful thing, sudo
<reisio>	it just means it was done on purpose
<sudokode>	who's the director of that movie? i'm gonna go stab him in the face
<d_garbage>	lol

<sudokode>	d_garbage: see j.j. abrams
<permagreen>	jeromelanteri, i know i did it before, but i think i just used makepkg and not yaourt
<reisio>	d_garbage: so don't watch it :p
<d_garbage>	indeed
<o9o6o>	anyone knows what locks the screen in plasma?
<cgm616>	can anyone help with my xorg issue?

<jeromelanteri>	d_garbage: i accept. start from where ?

<sudokode>	d_garbage: american is a subset of english
<spideykonfusion>	thx
<jeromelanteri>	d_garbage: thanks, but i not understand nothing in this wiki... there is no answer on "how to skip gpg keys on compil time" nor "where to start from (which directory) makepkg "
<d_garbage>	interesting collection anyway
<jeromelanteri>	lol sorry
<d_garbage>	jeromelanteri, why are you 'skipping' things?
<d_garbage>	use them properly?
<reisio>	[i] just don't use arch :p
<sudokode>	jeromelanteri: makepkg -h
<jushur>	skipping = breaking things..
<sudokode>	that tells you how to skip pgp checks
<nos09>	how do i build a module from source and install it?
<jeromelanteri>	d_garbage: is there an "hoxto" or "tutorial" for "little heads" ?
<sudokode>	you don't need to use pgp for aur packages, but it's recommended when offered
<sudokode>	it's also trivial to set up
<d_garbage>	the wiki is pretty straight forward, not sure how it could be simpler?
<jeromelanteri>	sdokode: ok, i try to read help on this makepkg
<sudokode>	i think it's a slight language barrier
<d_garbage>	!give jeromelanteri keyrings
<phrik>	jeromelanteri: http://allanmcrae.com/2015/01/two-pgp-keyrings-for-package-management-in-arch-linux/
<sudokode>	i don't know if we have a thai channel though?
<sudokode>	i'm not even sure if thai is a language
<d_garbage>	i think it's french isn't it?
<sudokode>	possibly just a style of food i agree with
<sudokode>	oh french, even better
<d_garbage>	hmm thai food <3
<sudokode>	there's definitely a french channel
<jeromelanteri>	where are the packages ?
<d_garbage>	what, after you built something? in the same directory as the pkgbuild
<d_garbage>	unless yaourt or similar nonsense
<jeromelanteri>	yes sure... but..; where ?
<qubitnerd>	0.0
<d_garbage>	well you must know where if you typed makepkg
<sudokode>	so why'd they disperse cw-7 anyway?
<sudokode>	this movie is already losing me
<d_garbage>	i don't think i've ever liked movies all that much
<qubitnerd>	makelve --safe
<sudokode>	d_garbage: i used to love them. now i'm more into tv shows

<d_garbage>	jeromelanteri, the $pwd of where you typed 'makepkg', the place where the pkgbuild is - i can't think of any more specific way of saying it
<lyonsb>	some day, phrik may finish his doctoral thesis on the arbitrary assignment of logic to linguistic expression.
<lyonsb>	or hers.

<jeromelanteri>	d_garbage: i never type makepkg myself, i use yaourt. but now i want to use makepkg for pass over the signature check. but i just would like to know where the pakage has been put by yaourt/pacman.
<d_garbage>	jeromelanteri, man yaourt
<d_garbage>	or better still don't use it at all
<qubitnerd>	lets see ...
<d_garbage>	some dumb place in /tmp iirc
<qubitnerd>	!yaourt
<phrik>	a script written in bash that wraps pacman and makepkg. https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yaourt/
<qubitnerd>	unfair
<amcrae>	we need to the old one back as !realyaourt
<d_garbage>	!yaourt2
<phrik>	yaourt is a pacman and aur frontend that is often broken and has a tendency to do stupid things, but if you want to use it anyway: http://archlinux.fr/yaourt-en
<dacoit>	!archlinuxfr
<phrik>	don't use it
<qubitnerd>	earnestly will remove them
<d_garbage>	ugh yeah that's a horrible idea
<qubitnerd>	!ubuntu
<soni>	so i need something to write my emj code with...
<bougyman>	jeromelanteri: yaourt puts stuff in /tmp/
<bougyman>	unless you yaourt -g <thing>
<bougyman>	then <thing> will be in ./
<bougyman>	if using yaourt as just a pkgbuild downloader, use yaourt -g
<d_garbage>	yaourt is bad enough but adding that repo and not even using makepkg to get it installed that's just a horrible idea
<bougyman>	the archlinuxfr repo is horrible
<jeromelanteri>	bougyman: looks like "/tmp/yaourt-tmp-jerome/"
<soni>	meh i need sleep, good night o/
<jeromelanteri>	ok, thanks
<bougyman>	yaourt is just some helpful wrappers.
<lyonsb>	if you use yaourt, you are likely to do *more* typing than you would if you just used makepkg.
<d_garbage>	plus then you have the repo
<lyonsb>	*maybe*
<d_garbage>	the existence of yaourt is eternally irksome
<dacoit>	like existence itself
<bougyman>	yaourt workflow: download aur thing to /tmp/yaourt-tmp-<username>/<thing>, show user the pkgbuild in an editor, run makepkg on thing
<d_garbage>	well, true
<bougyman>	which is the same thing i used to do before i started using yaurt.
<bougyman>	subsequently, it's why i chose yaourt. cause it used my same workflow.
<d_garbage>	pretty much. main thing is it confuses newbies
<pablotron>	fuck
<qubitnerd>	". in this distro, where are they by default ?  "
<d_garbage>	no thanks' i got a headache
<qubitnerd>	lol
<d_garbage>	!sting
<phrik>	ba-dum *ching*
<jeromelanteri>	d_garbage: yes, there is a lot of different informations,a nd also english not my first language... so all is really confused due to lot of different information and visual confusion between all of these.
<jeromelanteri>	but ok now, i compil without check pgp key (happy)
<d_garbage>	well yaourt certainly not helping lessen the confusion in this case
<dacoit>	and yogurt's gross
<d_garbage>	oh i don't know
<jeromelanteri>	d_garbage: yes maybe. newbies like easy way... so at final time, this add confusion for sure.
<d_garbage>	don't like it much but it's ok
<d_garbage>	easy != simple
<jeromelanteri>	yes
<jeromelanteri>	the fact is need time and practice for know and remember to use well all of thess administartions tools...
<jeromelanteri>	little by little.
<d_garbage>	arch has this fantastic, simple build system, here's this program that will ensure you never understand it
<d_garbage>	win
<dacoit>	!shrug2
<phrik>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<jeromelanteri>	and what about linux-mainline kernel ?
<qubitnerd>	what about it ?
<jeromelanteri>	i see better support of passthrough... but does it support and make running all other as well ? is it stable ?
<voidead>	so i ran fc-cache -vf after installing ttf-symbola but i still can't get it to show up in urxvt on my laptop.. my desktop is using the exact same urxvt config and it shows up on the desktop.. why won't it show up on the laptop?
<d_garbage>	arch has this really handy but unofficial and unsupported thing called the aur, here's this program that will make you think it's part of the distro
<rasi>	why do you put spaces before your question marks?
<sheep>	rasi: that's normal for some languages, like french
<d_garbage>	interesting
<dacoit>	well he wasnt expectign some kind of spanish inquisition
<d_garbage>	lol
<sheep>	dacoit: god dammit why
<dacoit>	:d
<sheep>	dacoit: i have a retort: the game
<jeromelanteri>	rasi: yes, we learn to do like that at school. so the answer could be: why not ?
<d_garbage>	indeed
<qubitnerd>	augh sheep you monster
<rasi>	jeromelanteri: thats fine then :p
<qubitnerd>	its just been one day !
<jeromelanteri>	rasi: thanks. i think that is this not confused, that can be fine yes.
<rasi>	jeromelanteri: just asking because there are *many* that do it, even though they learned it differently
<d_garbage>	!til
<phrik>	http://www.takenseriouslyamusing.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/til.jpg
<jeromelanteri>	rasi: yes, for sure. i never ask me why space before question mark tag... but yes, in thailand, i see really what is different way of learn / thinking / living... end then nothing is good or bad, but all are own reasons.
<rasi>	lets just pretend i understood what all that means
<rasi>	:p
<jeromelanteri>	in thailand, for exemple, in language writing, there is no tag marks for question or end of line... many words are linked together, etc...
<rasi>	well in thai you are more painting than writing, from my perspective :)
<d_garbage>	"when you go live in another country, it helps you see things differently"
<jeromelanteri>	i would like to be able to pretend anythings... and more specificaly that i can understand every think... but human can just pretend of, never be able all of that it can pretend, for sure.
<pjhuxford>	if i had a suspision that my wireless connection disconnects every now and then while on battery, which system logs would be the best to look at to determine whether the cause is on my end, or a router issue
<d_garbage>	"i try but, i dunno. shit's hard, you know?"
<pjhuxford>	i simply use netctl to connect to networks currently
<rasi>	journal?
<jeromelanteri>	rasi: how yes, from euoprean view, we can think about they are painting. but now, i think thai letters are real letters. not same as japan writing form.
<rasi>	jeromelanteri: sure
<rasi>	piefge: if its hardware related even dmsg might help
<jeromelanteri>	come to see thai country, go far from tourism part of land... the culture of peoples here is very good human thinking (out of big cities and tourism area)
<dacoit>	sounds very nice, im jealous.
<rasi>	jeromelanteri: i have been invited several times. my dad lives there. but i cant stand the weather
<sudokode>	hey it's the guy from turn i think
<jeromelanteri>	rasi: wich wheather ? hot ?
<rasi>	yes

<phrik>	title: jamie bell - imdb (at www.imdb.com)
<jeromelanteri>	now it is really very hot weather at this time... but on september, it's better.
<rasi>	jeromelanteri: i am somewhat freaky regarding temperature. i tend to sweat a lot at 20+
<d_garbage>	me too

<jeromelanteri>	but ok... really, just for see humans can thinking well, can have good hearts, never thinking bad way or imagine something, smile, do simple... really this is a good experience of life to see human can be like that. i think bouddhisme way of thinking help to...
<d_garbage>	weather in uk has been annoying for last few years, it goes from 13-15°c to 25-30°c with nothing in between
<dacoit>	damn thats obtuse

<rasi>	jeromelanteri: yea sure, there are no bad thais...
<jeromelanteri>	only in, big city have... were big monney is, bad people want to stole... lol
<youngwolf>	anyone using i3, how do i hide the menu bar of sublime text??
<jeromelanteri>	go far from cities, and see good peoples.

<jeromelanteri>	rasi: sure, you can choose to first search where something smell bad... but it is not what i want for my life.
<rasi>	and i dont want to be blue-eyed
<dacoit>	d_garbage, rasi, and jeromelanteri walk into a bar, and the barman says, "what's this, some kind of joke?"
<d_garbage>	man walks into a bar, "ouch!" :p
<jeromelanteri>	d_garbage: very funny.
<ffledgling>	it does say using /boot is recommended for mounting the efi system partition so that kernels can be stored there, but mine just 128mb
<ffledgling>	(from https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/beginners%27_guide#mount_the_partitions)
<phrik>	title: beginners' guide - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<d_garbage>	rasi, by the way, did you hear the joke about the monorail?
<pablotron>	alright problems aride
<pablotron>	arise
<rasi>	d_garbage: i dont think so
<d_garbage>	rasi, it's a one-liner :p
<rasi>	...
<rasi>	!rimshot
<jeromelanteri>	dacoit: i never go more in the bar... if you search me somewhere, sure... i will not be in the bar.
<phrik>	ba-dum tschh! http://instantrimshot.com/classic/?sound=rimshot
<rasi>	ffledgling: whats the actual problem
<rasi>	if any
<dacoit>	kernels are ~3-4mb initrds are closer to 10-70mb
<dacoit>	initcpios, rather
<d_garbage>	heh standard is ~ 5mb here and fallback is ~ 20mb, "kitchen sink"
<ffledgling>	rasi: actual problem is, i followed the beginner's guide, and i didn't get a bootable system
<jeromelanteri>	ffledgling: 128mb is fine. you can. and then, because this part on partition is in vfat, it is sure better to have this mounted only on /boot
<ffledgling>	rasi: when i boot i just get a /vmlinuz not found error
<rasi>	show your bootloader config
<rasi>	gummiboot i guess?
<rasi>	or grub?
<jeromelanteri>	ffledgling: do you use grub or gummiboot ?
<ffledgling>	i haven't installed anything special, so i think i get gummiboot by default
<rasi>	there is no default bootloader
<jeromelanteri>	wich link did you follow for do it (you tell about you follow something) ? could you give the link ?
<d_garbage>	hopefully !install
<ffledgling>	oh
<ffledgling>	well i followed https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/beginners%27_guide
<jeromelanteri>	ffledgling: "i followed the beginner's guide" a link ?
<phrik>	title: beginners' guide - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<polyzen>	anyone have a preferred epud reader for linux?
<polyzen>	i use fbreader on android, but it looks like shit here
<ffledgling>	rasi: i think that might be the problem i don't think i configured a boot loader
<jeromelanteri>	so it is gummiboot yes
<rasi>	ffledgling: that guide has instructions for gummiboot
<rasi>	so you did...
<jeromelanteri>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/gummiboot
<phrik>	title: gummiboot - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<dacoit>	polyzen: calibre
<rasi>	ffledgling: in your /boot directory should be a efi folder
<ffledgling>	rasi: under the last "confiure a boot loader section" right? i think i might've gotten a little too trigger happy and rebooted before that ...
<jeromelanteri>	ffledgling: also, after doing that, you have to see in your bios list of boot sequence the link of the bootloader (name would be explicit)
<rasi>	ffledgling: in that case install it
<ffledgling>	rasi: yes, going to do exactly that now
<rasi>	be sure to mount /boot before
<d_garbage>	i haven't installed for ages. why does uefi cause so much heart ache? it used to be so simple with bios?
<ffledgling>	jeromelanteri: i don't follow
<rasi>	d_garbage: uefi != efi
<dacoit>	one extreme to an other. underengineered to ober
<jeromelanteri>	nop, follow rasi is fine to.
<dacoit>	over
<rasi>	also efi has a lot of advantages over bios
<d_garbage>	rasi, whatever
<d_garbage>	i'm sure it does
<toqoz>	what are the advantages rasi?
<toqoz>	curious
<d_garbage>	but people seem to find it hugely confusing
<rasi>	!g efi vs bios
<phrik>	rasi: what is the difference in "boot with bios" and "boot with uefi ...: <http://superuser.com/questions/496026/what-is-the-difference-in-boot-with-bios-and-boot-with-uefi>
<jeromelanteri>	d_garbage: because change is something difficult
<rasi>	thats not a good link
<rasi>	meh
<rasi>	toqoz: one main advantage would be gpt partition scheme
<polyzen>	dacoit, calibre wasn't bad, but isn't it huge?
<d_garbage>	that's assuming they installed with bios first, and i'm not sure that's the case
<toqoz>	rasi: for more drive space?
<rasi>	that too, yes
<youngwolf>	how do i get rid of the menubar in sublime text?
<dacoit>	polyzen: it is massive, with a lot of deps :/
<rasi>	toqoz: no more extended partition crap
<toqoz>	yaoungwolf ctrl+shift+p menubar or something
<rasi>	toqoz: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unified_extensible_firmware_interface
<phrik>	title: unified extensible firmware interface - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (at en.wikipedia.org)
<polyzen>	dacoit, huzzah!
<toqoz>	rasi: ah i see
<rasi>	toqoz: at the top it lists the basic things efi does better
<jeromelanteri>	is someone here use linux-mailine kernel ?
<toqoz>	rasi: looking
<jeromelanteri>	mainline
<dacoit>	polyzen: if you like light, ppub is python+gtk3+webkit
<rasi>	light and webkit in one sentence...
<polyzen>	dacoit, i'd noticed that
<polyzen>	dacoit, tried it?
<polyzen>	heh rasi
<dacoit>	polyzen: yeah, its pretty nice actually. pretty slender, just a menubar up top
<polyzen>	maintainer     : (orphan)
<polyzen>	that's always a good sign
<polyzen>	i see
<dacoit>	it looks abandoned though :(
<dacoit>	i guess its been quite a while
<polyzen>	the screenshot doesn't even exist anymore :p
<polyzen>	i already had this starred o.o
<rasi>	emacs epub mode!
<polyzen>	rasi, comes with it?
<polyzen>	!g epub vim
<phrik>	polyzen: etnadji/vim-epub · github: <https://github.com/etnadji/vim-epub>
<rasi>	polyzen: afaik yes
<rasi>	ouch pandoc dependency for vim-epub
<dacoit>	theres no pleasing you :p
<rasi>	i just use my actual ebook-reader :)
<dacoit>	that has a dexterity dependency
<dacoit>	ableist!
<rasi>	lol
<rasi>	how do you handle the computer then
<rasi>	picard-style?
<dacoit>	haha yup
<polyzen>	how does picard read ebooks?
<rasi>	he listens...
<dacoit>	http://s131.photobucket.com/user/lagm0nkey/media/sexy_picard.jpg.html
<polyzen>	thought that was it
<dacoit>	.jpg.html goddamnit
<polyzen>	lol
<polyzen>	o/
<d_garbage>	well the grub install for efi doesn't seem that impossibly complicated?
<polyzen>	02:04
<d_garbage>	just read the wiki. it's not the most brilliantly written article ever but it makes sense
<d_garbage>	so i'm guessing that most of the problems are caused by wonky firmware?
<rasi>	no
<rasi>	!users
<phrik>	idiots, http://i.imgur.com/ife3dhg.gif
<d_garbage>	heh
<d_garbage>	well for example last time i tried to boot the arch iso it wouldn't
<d_garbage>	it detected 'uefi' and then refused to work, after some checking it seemed that my mobo some kind of 'almost' uefi but not implemented? i gave up and used an opensuse iso instead
<rasi>	problems arise when uefi is enabled
<d_garbage>	there is nothing in the firmware menu that mentions and settings for it
<d_garbage>	!shrug
<phrik>	¯\(º_o)/¯
<d_garbage>	so like i said, in theory simple, in practice bloody nightmare
<rasi>	its called something like "secure boot"
<d_garbage>	nope, nothing
<d_garbage>	spent ages on it
<rasi>	never buy transitional hardware :)
<d_garbage>	hah! indeed
<tylerdurden01>	i just enabled the legacy boot option
<rasi>	tylerdurden01: weakling!
<rasi>	i dont have any efi board yet
<tylerdurden01>	rasi: yeah, well, i don't know how uefi's gonna help me
<rasi>	but with next intel generation i plan to upgrade
<tylerdurden01>	hell, i don't even know what uefi is. looking online, it's supposed to be some kind of gui with hardware stuff in it, but i don't have anything like that.
<rasi>	the gui is totally unrelated
<rasi>	like mentioned before: for the user gpt partitioning is the most obvious advantage
<tylerdurden01>	rasi: yeah, i don't need that
<rasi>	just wait when you get larger hds
<rasi>	then you will
<d_garbage>	from a user's point of view it's hardly very different to bios
<d_garbage>	you set up some partitions, you run an installer, you do some config. job done
<jeromelanteri>	if i did it, you can do it...
<d_garbage>	lol indeed
<d_garbage>	i often say that too
<d_garbage>	so the problem's not the 'theory' it's real life not behaving like it should
<d_garbage>	it happens a lot doesn't it? bios was limited but established and everyone know what to expect. uefi is a fancy and new and 'designed' with 'standards' and is a complete mess that nobody can agree on implementing :)
<d_garbage>	and by the time it's all sorted out and standard, it will be time to invent something 'better' all over again :)
<jeromelanteri>	ok then... my kernel is patched and compiled... i reboot and cross fingers... amen.
<jeromelanteri>	allways the same problem. and then, my audio devices run out... wtf
<rasi>	jeromelanteri: :(
<jeromelanteri>	is there any channel where have some specialists for pci passthrough or qemu/kvm ?
<rasi>	#qemu?
<jeromelanteri>	i try
<jeromelanteri>	#qemu => no way.
<rasi>	!g kvm freenode
<phrik>	rasi: lists, irc - kvm: <http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/lists,_irc>
<jeromelanteri>	#guru-linux => no way lol
<jeromelanteri>	#kvm => +1 (thanks)
<pablotron>	im so screwed
<pablotron>	i accidentally clicked downgrade xorg-server
<jeromelanteri>	also, do you have an idea why my ssd ocz vertex2 connected on sata3-2 sometimes can be see on ls /dev/sd* and sometimes not ?
<gnea>	pablotron: so why not just re-upgrade it?
<rasi>	pablotron: clicked?
<pablotron>	out of memory
<jeromelanteri>	and also, when try to add it on /etc/fstab with correct uuid, the system don't want to mount it ?
<pablotron>	alright
<rasi>	!manjaro
<pablotron>	pacmanxg
<phrik>	manjaro does a lot of things differently from what arch does. ask in #manjaro
<rasi>	pablotron: ok
<rasi>	;)
<pablotron>	my computer was going so slow
<pablotron>	during the removal
<qubitnerd>	you clicked ?
<ffledgling>	okay, so i was at the step where i need to congigure the bootloader and i saw "for uefi boot, the drive needs to be gpt-partitioned and an efi system partition (512 mib or larger, gdisk type ef00, formatted with fat32) must be present. in the following examples, this partition is assumed to be mounted at /boot. if you have followed this guide from the beginning, you have already done all of these."
<ffledgling>	my pre-existing efi partition made by windows is 128mb and not 512 and it's fat16 and not fat32
<ffledgling>	will that be a problem during insallation?
<dacoit>	no, will probably work fine
<d_garbage>	i just read the wiki and that sounds fine :p
<d_garbage>	saves you the job of setting it up
<d_garbage>	eventually i'll get a new drive and then we can see what this gpt thing can do :)
<ffledgling>	i think i did all of this last time and it didn't work...
<ffledgling>	let me try again
<d_garbage>	this time it will :)
<nkparadox>	hello, anyone know how can i get a list of the installed packages from core repo?
<rasi>	hmm... whats a good way to store 2 strings in one line. in the best parsable way possible
<d_garbage>	some grep probably
<rasi>	i am more thinking about the format to store
<rasi>	i need a line number + the string of the line
<ffledgling>	hell yes! it worked :d
<rasi>	but there are special cases. something like line starting with spaces
<toqoz>	nkparadox, maybe pacman -ss | grep installed ?
<rasi>	01|$string
<rasi>	i just dont know whats a good format
<d_garbage>	you can list a repo with -sl
<rasi>	ffledgling: gz
<dacoit>	nkparadox: paclist core
<d_garbage>	is that installed though?
<dacoit>	yeah
<d_garbage>	a list of that is
<jasonwryan>	rasi: $number:$string
<nkparadox>	dacoit, that worked!
<dacoit>	-sl gives a list of all, with annotations ofr [installed]
<dacoit>	s/ofr/for
<rasi>	jasonwryan: awk $2 will prpoperly use the spaces, if present, yes?
<jasonwryan>	use -f:
<rasi>	awk -f ':'
<rasi>	yes
<jasonwryan>	heh
<d_garbage>	nice
<d_garbage>	i keep forgetting all these little scripts
<jasonwryan>	or just with the shell "${var#:*}"
<rasi>	jasonwryan: oh, i really should use that more often
<rasi>	i tend to spawn 100s of subshells in my scripts
<jasonwryan>	pe is handy

<dacoit>	dunst \o/
<bluhdz>	note: some bluetooth cards (e.g. broadcom) conflict  with the network adapter. thus, you need to make sure that your  bluetooth device get connected before the network service boot.
<bluhdz>	how do i do that?
<dacoit>	network-pre.target?
<jeromelanteri>	group 1 is not viable, please ensure all devices within the iommu_group are bound to their vfio bus driver. how i can ensure taht ?
<spideykonfusion>	any killer applications anyone loves to use or recommends?

<spideykonfusion>	new to arch and just messing with stuff
<jeromelanteri>	xkill
<bluhdz>	htop
<dacoit>	lolol
<jeromelanteri>	ctrl-escape and choose wich one to kill
<spideykonfusion>	jeromelanteri: -_-
<jeromelanteri>	happy ?
<spideykonfusion>	not what i was looking for but you get what you ask for i guess?
<dacoit>	best miscommunication the world has ever seen :-)
<jasonwryan>	spideykonfusion: tmux
<spideykonfusion>	bluhdz: looks cool thanks
<spideykonfusion>	jasonwryan: ive heard of that and screen, any experience with the latter?
<jushur>	spideykonfusion: tmux, weechat, mpv, youtube-dl, livestreamer
<dacoit>	the latter is old and crusty
<jasonwryan>	spideykonfusion: tmux is better
<jeromelanteri>	roup 1 is not viable, please ensure all devices within the iommu_group are bound to their vfio bus driver. how i can ensure tath ?
<jeromelanteri>	that
<spideykonfusion>	jasonwryan: awesome ill play around with it
<jasonwryan>	np: the wiki page is pretty good…
<jeromelanteri>	(crying)
<ubone>	how is kvm used?
<spideykonfusion>	jushur: gonna look at tmux, love weechat, stream my music so no mpv for now, ill look into livestreamer too
<spideykonfusion>	thanks guys
<jeromelanteri>	ubone: by the user ?
<ubone>	yes
<jeromelanteri>	ubone: heu.... depend of the user.
<jeromelanteri>	ubone: by me: not so good... i failed to pci-passthrough my nvidia graphic card
<jeromelanteri>	and no one know how to do that here at this time.
<voidead>	so i ran fc-cache -vf after installing ttf-symbola but i still can't get it to show up in urxvt on my laptop.. my desktop is using the exact same urxvt config and it shows up on the desktop.. why won't it show up on the laptop?
<jeromelanteri>	ubone: what do you want to do ?
<ubone>	run a custom winxp for a proprietary program
<jeromelanteri>	with or without passthrought pci ports ?
<jeromelanteri>	wait... i have a link for you...
<tom^>	jeromelanteri: do you have iommu?
<jeromelanteri>	http://vfio.blogspot.com.au/2015_05_01_archive.html
<phrik>	title: vfio tips and tricks: may 2015 (at vfio.blogspot.com.au)
<jeromelanteri>	tom^: yes
<tom^>	jeromelanteri: oh well then you have the necessery requirements i guess :p
<jeromelanteri>	tom^: yes, for the hardware i have, the software to i think... but for the knowledge.. i miss. then maybe you could help me ?
<tom^>	nope, never done pci passthrough nor used kvm
<jeromelanteri>	(cry again)
<jeromelanteri>	ubone: the link is ok for you ?
<ubone>	so to use kvm i have use qemu
<jeromelanteri>	you have also other one for kvm on wiki.
<ubone>	it doesnt tell much, exept use qemu+kvm
<toqoz>	voidead: have you tried xset fp rehash ?
<jeromelanteri>	in the wiki, there is for qemu and kvm, and the like i show you is for use with virtual-manager (easier by the fact you can see the options)
<toqoz>	voidead: actually xset +fp /usr/share/fonts/local before that
<voidead>	toqoz, yes in ~/.xinitrc
<jeromelanteri>	ubone: yes, you have to use qemu and kvm together
<voidead>	i have that
<toqoz>	voidead: then i dont know, sorry
<jeromelanteri>	ubone: start by the qemu page of the wiki
<voidead>	toqoz, its a bit strange.. i don't know what my desktop has that my laptop doesn't *shrug*
<toqoz>	voidead: after a few hours youll find out its something dumb, does the font show up in xfontsel?
<jeromelanteri>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/qemu
<phrik>	title: qemu - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<voidead>	toqoz, yeah it does
<voidead>	toqoz, actually it shows up in other applications
<jeromelanteri>	ubone: for winxp guest, boot by bios option, not uefi...
<voidead>	just not urxvt
<toqoz>	voidead, maybe you forgot xrdb --merge ?
<jeromelanteri>	ubone: i think by virtualbox it can be more easier to do it also...
<voidead>	toqoz, https://ptpb.pw/bcsa
<voidead>	toqoz, my ~/.xinitrc
<rasi>	are those bitmap fonts?
<voidead>	rasi, are you talking to me?
<rasi>	ah symbola
<rasi>	those are ttf
<rasi>	and not in /usr/share/fonts/local
<toqoz>	voidead, hmm... have you just tried doing xrdb -merge ~/.xresources via console?
<rasi>	they are in /usr/share/fonts/ttf
<rasi>	and *should* just work (tm)
<voidead>	lol tm
<voidead>	toqoz, i will try that now
<rasi>	toqoz: what has xrdb to do with fontconfig
<rasi>	nothing...
<rasi>	or is this about urxvt?
<voidead>	rasi, urxvt
<rasi>	ok
<voidead>	its about symbola not showing
<rasi>	can i see your xresources?
<voidead>	rasi, its strange though.. as my desktop has pretty much the _exact_ same setup as my laptop
<toqoz>	lol
<voidead>	rasi, https://ptpb.pw/58bf
<rasi>	ehm, you are not specifying symbola anywhere
<rasi>	you need to set it as a fallback font
<voidead>	rasi, sorry this was an old one
<voidead>	but yeah.. i had symbola in there
<voidead>	xft:symbola: etc..
<rasi>	can i have the current one?
<rasi>	want to make sure to have the exact same config
<voidead>	https://ptpb.pw/z1ef
<rasi>	how can i test if symbola works
<rasi>	can you paste a symbol?
<voidead>	rasi, ah yes hold on
<rasi>	fun, i have those crap spacing issues
<rasi>	i hate urxvt
<rasi>	with a passion
<voidead>	 ☠
<tom^>	rasi: so use termite?
<rasi>	tom^: i do
<rasi>	voidead: https://fb.53280.de/ngcvd/
<rasi>	seems to work?
<rasi>	and look at those spacings... disgusting
<jushur>	rasi: why do you hate urxvt?
<rasi>	jushur: the screenshot should be self explaining
<rasi>	:p
<voidead>	rasi, thats why i use the patched version
<voidead>	but anyways.. yeah termite is my primary terminal
<voidead>	i like urxvt though
<rasi>	termite also has some small annoyances, but i like it
<jushur>	rasi: hmm, i use it with terminus font, find it to be very nice. tho you want to use small font, for it to be good.
<rasi>	sometimes it types invisible letters
<rasi>	jushur: there is more i dont like about urxvt
<rasi>	i wont go back
<jushur>	rasi: well its good, we got some choises :)
<rasi>	perl plugins for example. it all seems like a big hack
<voidead>	see the main thing that pisses me off with urxvt is you have to have a ton of fallback fonts to see _most_ fonts.. and with termite you can see pretty much all fonts you have on your system..
<rasi>	back then the url-select plugin regulary froze my x
<voidead>	however.. i really like urxvt in other aspects
<tom^>	rasi: lol yea same here now that you mention it
<jushur>	i use urxvt*.matcher.button:   c-1
<jushur>	ehm, you guys do know you only set one font for urxvt, and have utf8 handle the rest?
<rasi>	ehm, what?
<rasi>	utf8 is not a handler
<rasi>	if urxvt has no defined font for a character it will simple paint a square
<rasi>	simply*
<jushur>	no
<jushur>	only if you dont run utf8
<rasi>	which is unlikely in a arch setup
<rasi>	because it defaults to utf8
<jushur>	no
<rasi>	and i always had squares
<jushur>	it does not actually, you need to specify utf8 and use apps that are utf8 aware.
<voidead>	jushur, see.. i don't know what the hell this means.. because.. i _must_ have fallback fonts set or else.. i have utf8 setup on my computer and urxvt has all sorts of shit missing
<toqoz>	i only have terminus selected in xresources, and i could see the symbol before.
<rasi>	urxvt also painted some utf symbols much bigger than regular letters and cut off the top/bottom because of line height
<rasi>	:)
<jeromelanteri>	wtf... when i install linux-virtio module, it installed it on kernel 3.14....lts. and now, i am on this one. then i want to: 1 install it on kernel 3.19 (no lts) and then boot on it. how to do it ?
<voidead>	see.. what i'm saying is.. like.. dejavu sans mono can see many symbols and fonts.. but it still has stuff missing
<jushur>	rasi: that i can belive, tho this is kinda an issue with forced line height
<rasi>	jeromelanteri: anyway. i am not a fan of urxvt
<yeowang>	i actually like the way you can set fallback fonts for urxvt. but i don't like the way it renders fonts. works much better for me in termite. :c
<jeromelanteri>	urxvt ?
<voidead>	yes urxvt
<jeromelanteri>	what is that ?
<voidead>	yeowang, agreed
<yeowang>	jeromelanteri: a terminal emulator.
<jushur>	jeromelanteri: rxvt-unicode
<yeowang>	^
<jeromelanteri>	ok
<yeowang>	urxvt is just the short name.
<jeromelanteri>	when i install linux-virtio module, it installed it on kernel 3.14....lts. and now, i am on this one. then i want to: 1 install it on kernel 3.19 (no lts) and then boot on it. how to do it ?
<rasi>	yeowang: pango support for urxvt would be a good thing i guess
<yeowang>	rasi: actually, i don't exactly know what pango is. would you care to enlighten me? :d
<rasi>	its the font system used by e.g. termite
<voidead>	jushur, i'm really curious how you can see fonts with urxvt using only one font in the config..
<rasi>	while urxvt uses xft
<jeromelanteri>	i not understand why the package has been installed on the lts kernel...
<yeowang>	jeromelanteri: you want to switch the kernel?
<jeromelanteri>	yes
<yeowang>	rasi: oh thank you. :)
<yeowang>	voidead: maybe it's the settings in fonts.conf. :o
<jeromelanteri>	and install linux-virtio on the other one
<voidead>	yeowang, perhaps
<rasi>	or terminus simply has this symbol
<voidead>	yeowang, yeah i'm just going to stick to termite and forget urxvt.. i mean i really like urxvt in many ways but as far as the font thing goes its a dealbreaker
<yeowang>	voidead: same for me. i don't really like the keybindings though. but i was able to change the ones i use, so i'm happy with that.
<jushur>	voidead: could be i use tmux and have enabled utf8 setting for it.
<jushur>	tmux is not using utf8 by default
<voidead>	jushur, i'm using utf with tmux too
<yeowang>	jeromelanteri: what did you do to install the kernel? just 'pacman -syyu $kernel'?
<jeromelanteri>	ok thanks. but, that i not understand is i was on kernel 3.19 and now i'm on 3.14-lts... crazy...
<voidead>	jushur, see what i'm saying is.. lets say.. you have "hermit" declared in ~/.xresources.. well what if you want to see chinese characters or something.. it seems impossible in urxvt as hermit doesn't have support for that language
<jeromelanteri>	i did something wrong but... looks like a spacio temporal thinks happen...
<sudokode>	snowpiercer...
<sudokode>	what a terrible ending
<voidead>	sudokode, horrible movie
<voidead>	yes
<sudokode>	it was good up until the end
<sudokode>	wtf
<tom^>	sudokode: are you drunk?
<voidead>	i hated the whole movie
<voidead>	it sucked
<sudokode>	no, i'm stoned
<yeowang>	jeromelanteri: ? i can't understand what you're saying.
<sudokode>	lol
<sudokode>	tom^: are you drunk?
<tom^>	no i just woke up :p
<sudokode>	i gave up the hooch for the chronic a while back
<jeromelanteri>	yeah ok, i know what's happened now... i was reboot in the same time the system was updating...
<dacoit>	bunch of degenerates
<sudokode>	ikr
<sudokode>	lol
<junka>	hello dacoit :d
<dacoit>	junka: hello!
<junka>	did you get you key? :3
<dacoit>	what key would that be
<voidead>	yeah that didn't do anything
<voidead>	still missing fonts
<voidead>	complete bs
<voidead>	termite it is from now
<voidead>	on
<junka>	um for pulling that dictonary package? :d
<dacoit>	junka: i think you've got the wrong guy :p i wouldnt be caught dead with a dictionary
<junka>	dacoit; i'm really sorry :p
<rasi>	checkglyph /usr/share/fonts/ttf/terminusttf.ttf 9760
<rasi>	skull and crossbones
<rasi>	false
<rasi>	ok.. terminus doesnt have it
<yeowang>	jeromelanteri: that doesn't make sense? you probably just didn't change the name in the bootloader.
<jeromelanteri>	yes, that i have to do.
<voidead>	the moment i realized how shitty urxvt is when i tried to edit my ~/.conkyrc file which has fontawesome icons in it and all the icons were blocks..
<jushur>	i can read the chinese signs perfectly fine here, just need to use a size:14 besides my normal size:12 as its a bit small on my screen if not.
<jeromelanteri>	but at update time, i think it change on upadte my kernel-lts... i have to remove this one too...
<jeromelanteri>	when it updated linux-lts, it create links on boot grub on it...
<jushur>	if you have the font installed and properly configured, and its a utf8 enabled font it will show up in urxvt
<voidead>	jushur, no it won't
<voidead>	because i already have all of that configured on _both_ machines
<yeowang>	jeromelanteri: you don't have to uninstall your lts kernel, just change the kernel in the bootloader.
<jushur>	its the whole point of utf system?
<yeowang>	jeromelanteri: what's your bootloader?
<voidead>	these fonts show up in _every_ other application except urxvt
<jeromelanteri>	yes, i just want to be sure next time it not do it again. i not use the kernel-lts, so i will remove it.
<yeowang>	jeromelanteri: again, your bootloader?
<jeromelanteri>	grub
<jushur>	so you guys actually use a hardcoded .ttf file that is not utf8 enabled. and expect it to behave as such?
<vlatkob>	jhass: tomty89: just to let you know that i found the culprit for <pre> rendering problem you helped me yesterday. it was the old dconf db. removed it and all works nicely. thanks for help
<voidead>	jushur, uh no? what makes you think that?
<jushur>	/usr/share/fonts/ttf/terminusttf.ttf
<voidead>	ah well.. yeah i don't do that
<voidead>	jushur, just out of sheer curiosity.. where can i find more information on configurint my system for utf-8 as you mentioned so that urxvt shows all fonts all the time?
<voidead>	beceause
<voidead>	i did actually use the arch wiki
<voidead>	and its all utf-8 on my system
<voidead>	hence.. fonts actually show up
<voidead>	just not urxvt
<voidead>	urxvt must be special then
<jushur>	voidead: well how do you define your font for urxvt?
<jeromelanteri>	yeowang: grub. but ok, i try to install the linux-mainline one, remove the lts, keep the other kernel 3.19, and will add entries for each one i keep in grub. thanks.
<voidead>	xft:
<voidead>	jushur, if you don't mind.. could you post your ~/.xresources or ~/.xdefaults?
<jushur>	voidead: yah same here, and i dont feel ive done anything special to my config
<jushur>	urxvt*.font: xft:terminus:pixelsize=12:antialias=false
<voidead>	jushur, its likely something systemwide
<voidead>	not sure what though
<jushur>	same for .boldfont
<voidead>	could it be your xorg config?
<yeowang>	jeromelanteri: you're welcome, i guess.
<jushur>	i messed some with the links for fonts. but nothing special
<emris>	i"m getting ready to do a dual boot install to my macbook 10,1 i noticed there was no fan action when botting to the liveusb. and there seems to be generally strange information about this. how do i make sure i don't burn my macbook up while installing?
<tom^>	lol clever apple, let the os control the fan and default to 0% so if you try to install something else meltdown
<voidead>	see what is surprising to me is.. most people also have this urxvt issue.. but my friend who also claims to see all fonts and icon using urxvt also cannot explain _how_ his system differs from mine
<emris>	tom^: yeah :/ pretty much...
<sd1001>	the macbook(s) i've installed linux on has been on full fan while booting from other stuff, i think
<jushur>	voidead: i got en_us el_gr and sv_se enabled for locale.gen and en_us is set as system default. and all of them is enabled with utf-8 and their iso counterpart.
<dacoit>	yikes what model is that? never had anything close (mbp 6,2)
<jushur>	voidead: only thing that coes to mind for me, that i have that not all have.
<emris>	sd1001: zero fan action at all...not even the slightest
<emris>	dacoit: late 2013 retina mbp 512ssd, 16gb
<dacoit>	emris: i'm not sure how that model exposed fan controls, my guess is via hwmon at /sys/class/hwmon/...
<dacoit>	/sys/devices/platform/applesmc*
<voidead>	jushur, https://ptpb.pw/hb5d
<voidead>	ah what font configuration are you using?
<voidead>	infinality?
<jushur>	voidead: default install, only some adjustment of the links
<sb0>	hi. i'd like to install arch linux on a machine that has a kernel bug that prevents installation. is it difficult to replace the kernel (and modules) on the installation stick with a custom one?
<jushur>	voidead: the skull you wrote earlier shows for me, but its tiny. as it should be at 12x pt
<emris>	dacoit: thx, i'll look in to it.
<jushur>	sb0: no its very easy, but you need a instaleld system to do it.
<jushur>	sb0: basicly you can make your own livecd very easy.
<sb0>	i have an installed arch system...
<tom^>	sb0: what kernel bug?
<jushur>	voidead: im very interrested in why this is happening, if you ever get to learn what it is plz make sure i get to know :)
<sb0>	tom^, kernels more recent than ~3.13.11 have severe emmc controller driver bugs on thinkpad tablet 10. i have reported them months ago, still not fixed.
<dagle>	sb0: you can install arch from any other distro, i have installed arch from gentoo because i needed it.
<sb0>	tom^, those bugs crash the install in minutes.
<tom^>	sb0: cant you just blacklist the module?
<sb0>	then no emmc :)
<jushur>	sb0: just block the kernel module for that emmc device?
<voidead>	jushur, well its a mystery.. like i said.. my friend also has no idea why.. he just says "i guess its some package i have installed on my system *shrugs*"
<tom^>	and emmc = ?
<sb0>	emmc is the main storage on this machine
<tom^>	oh
<jushur>	sb0: i belive this is what you want https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/remastering_the_install_iso
<phrik>	title: remastering the install iso - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<voidead>	jushur, i'll put in his exact same ~/.xresources and i'll have fonts missing and when he screenshots the icons they are shown
<jushur>	voidead: must be some missing config or some package then.
<voidead>	i guess.. but i mean.. i have nearly everything he has installed.. i have no clue as to what he has that i don't have
<jushur>	sb0: actually there is some tools to make it automaticly for you, forgot what it was. made me one for my full system zfs installs.
<sb0>	i'll have a look at that, thanks
<sb0>	not exactly easy, but doable. at least there are detailed instructions :)
<talented>	arch seems to be a popular channel, i've never tried this distribution but numbers suggest it would be worthwhile
<jeromelanteri>	talented: i try many distributions, and for me arch is the best one for do everything.
<tom^>	you are just confused, we got 1900~ bots and lurkers that has never spoken in here.
<sb0>	so i should just put the new modules in the /lib/modules chroot, erase the old ones, and mkinitcpio will build the initramfs with those new modules?
<jeromelanteri>	talented: and i think this one has the last on edge of all packages
<talented>	i've tried many too, but time to set up my system usually got lesser and lesser that i just went for ones that just worked without hassle
<talented>	i started with red hat, continued with fedora, went away to ubuntu, switched to mint, sort of just run mint and fedora now but would be interested to see how arch is
<jeromelanteri>	talented: for my own (i consider myself has an eternel newbie one), it is not the most easier to use (but in fact, need time to learn all) but it is the most modern one.
<tom^>	talented: its time to realize linux is still linux on other distros.
<\pub\bash0r>	for me arch is the one with the fewest troubles on updates
<voidead>	\pub\bash0r, spot on
<\pub\bash0r>	i had f*cked up installations of ubuntu, fedora, magaia, etc.
<jushur>	sb0: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/archiso that was the page i read when i made my iso.
<phrik>	title: archiso - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<talented>	yea i know, but for me, whatever worked out of the box on whatever laptop/computer i was installing it on, usually was the one
<jeromelanteri>	tom^: linux is linux, but package maintener here are really on the edge.
<\pub\bash0r>	but my arch system i initially setup in 2007 still runs
<voidead>	pacman is a package maintainer god
<talented>	find my self less inside config files these days
<\pub\bash0r>	(the only "big" problems were with the migration of /usr/bin and when the x server got a huge overhaul)
<tom^>	there isnt pretty much anything that you can do here that you cant do on ubuntu or fedora
<\pub\bash0r>	voidead: indeed :d
<jeromelanteri>	talented: so for your know, if you don't want to touch the system many times, consider to install kernel-lts (more stable because not update all the time)
<tom^>	jeromelanteri: wrong, the lts kernel sometimes updates even more often.
<sudokode>	uh oh
<\pub\bash0r>	i think kernel-lts complicates things ...
<sudokode>	beverly hills cop 4 got tba'ed
<supergeek800>	tom^: except have a roller without having to go to a development branch.
<jeromelanteri>	tom^: sometimes, not all the time
<\pub\bash0r>	especially since most packages expect recent kernels
<sudokode>	that's a shame
<\pub\bash0r>	so if they drift apart, stuff may break

<\pub\bash0r>	(actually it's the one component with the least configuration :d)
<jeromelanteri>	tom^: why you choose archlinux ?
<sudokode>	ooo
<sudokode>	what's this
<kave>	i'm trying to unistall "ituns" installed with wine . i couldnt find ituns in wine unistaller list [gui] so i removed  ~/.wine folder but still when i right click in some media files like mp3 , in submenu ofopen with other application still itun exist ! how can i fix that?
<sudokode>	spexp] the stanford prison experiment 7/17/2015
<sudokode>	that might be good
<tom^>	jeromelanteri: because i learned how to make pkgbuilds and now i cant be arsed learning another package manager.
<\pub\bash0r>	tom^: even if you did, pkgbuilds would still rule them all
<jeromelanteri>	tom^: do you try to install last one version of anything on other distro ?
<\pub\bash0r>	dpkg and rpm are horrific in regards to their build processes
<tom^>	jeromelanteri: i think you are underestimating the amount of -git packages i have installed.
<talented>	i'll install arch now on one of my laptops, see how it goes
<supergeek800>	kernel-lts is a nogo for me unless r8192su gets ported to 3.14.xx, and kernel won't boot for me so far, and neither will kernel-mainline, so stuck with kernel-ck.
<tom^>	jeromelanteri: it would be no difference in any other distro.
<kave>	tom^ , do you know how to fix that ?
<jeromelanteri>	tom^: for my own experience, there is many.
<supergeek800>	also, for those of you wanting or having to use alternate kernels that aren't in the official repos, and don't wanna deal with compiling, unofficial repos ftw.
<talented>	have to say, that was a fail on the website, hunting just for download, going too fast that i missed it being in the top right corner
<jeromelanteri>	tom^: consider i not have the true on my speaking, i'm not god or guru one... i just tell my vision from my own experience. but sure... there is some people who ever know better than the other and allways speaking the big reallity (they own reality)
<supergeek800>	got kernel-ck from [repo-ck] and got kernel-mainline from [miffe].
<voidead>	has anyone else noticed that https://www.archlinux.org according to chromium has "outdated security methods"?

<talented>	i'm using chrome voidead, it didn't say that, got chromium on the laptop but can't be bothered walking 3 metres to it
<voidead>	are you using the newest version of chrome/chromium?
<yeowang>	kave: that has probably something to do with your file manager, somewhere along your journey you set itunes as standard file handler for those.
<talented>	well unless it updated last week, it should be latest chrome, stable though
<talented>	google chrome version 42.0.2311.90 (64-bit)
<voidead>	yeah same for me
<talented>	well, latest for fedora 21
<supergeek800>	and i'm using ff, fuck 8-yr-old single-core cpus in the ass.
<kave>	yeowang : you mean ituns is gone , but my file manager config is still alive ? :)
<talented>	i'll check on chromium
<voidead>	talented, is your "lock" icon green or does it show a yellow sign?
<voidead>	before "https://"
<talented>	ahh, i see, it does have a problem
<jeromelanteri>	kave: maybe on some config files from wine...
<voidead>	yeah what is going on
<talented>	it's a lock with a yellow triangle
<voidead>	says that archlinux.org has outdated security methods/config
<talented>	yea, same message
<voidead>	hmm
<talented>	saying no public audit records
<talented>	would that just mean, the verifier just hasn't audited the site yet?
<voidead>	yeah who knows
<kave>	jeromelateri : i'm confused :|  i think both filemanager and wine must be edit to fix the problem.
<jeromelanteri>	kave: yes.
<jushur>	kave: what desktop do you run?
<kave>	jushur: xfce4
<talented>	chrome failed, my chromium didn't
<jeromelanteri>	talented: good news in fact....
<sudokode>	why are you using chrome?
<jushur>	kave: thunar file manager?
<kave>	jushur : yes
<jeromelanteri>	talented: you can trash chrome.
<talented>	just never bothered to change it on my fc21 system... hardly ever used this computer
<talented>	it's been on here since fc15 maybe?
<talented>	i remember one guy preferred chrome because he liked the colour of the ball better
<jushur>	kave: possibly it could be .config/mimeapps.list
<jeromelanteri>	kave: how did you install ituns ?
<jushur>	kave: check if it contains your removed app
<tom^>	kave: if you dont want any wine file associations, rm ~/.local/share/applications/wine-*
<kave>	jermolenteri: just presed enter on itunes.exe :)
<jeromelanteri>	so they would have an uninstaller exec file also... or not ?

<jushur>	having wine default to be a system executable manager is kinda bad, one of the reasons i never use it. it makes for horrible security

<jushur>	tom^: exactly :d

<jeromelanteri>	tomty89: so maybe you know how to make pci passthrough a gtx750 nvidia with qeum and kvm ?
<ahc>	ldd shows  for exampel "libattr.so.1 => /usr/lib/../lib/libattr.so.1", is it something wrong with the linking?
<yeowang>	jeromelanteri: there's a big thread in the arch forums about passthrough.
<tom^>	jeromelanteri: also you do know you have to run on your intel onboard to be able to passthrough your nvidia card?
<jeromelanteri>	yeowang i read all of it...
<tom^>	or well not necessery intel, but your onboard :p
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: and not really. i've mentioned that i only had faint memory passthroughing a tv card
<jeromelanteri>	tom^: yes, my bios is vtd enable.
<jushur>	actually you need a seckond gfx card, it dont need to be onboard
<tomty89>	jeromelanteri: also after some googling later, i start to recall vga passthrough could be even more difficult and with the overhead, the performance might not be satisfying
<jeromelanteri>	jushur: my onboard card is intel one... my nvidia is the pci one. i use intel onboard for linux host
<yeowang>	jeromelanteri: well, where does the hiccup happen?

<jushur>	tomty89: im always right!
<doctorjellyface>	i want to repackage the ubuntu gnome grub theme in the aur, however the originial mantainer renamed everything from ubuntu gnome to just gnome. should i include a patch that does that renaming too, or should i leave it named ubuntu gnome?
<tomty89>	aur is about what you want to do, isn't it?
<tomty89>	so do you think it looks better with or without renaming?
<jushur>	just make sure it dont say "booting ubuntu gnome" on the grub boot
<tomty89>	*shrug* does it matter
<falu>	anyone got thinkpad trackpoint scrolling working at the moment?
<doctorjellyface>	ok, thanks
<doctorjellyface>	i just don't want to miscredit anyone
<tomty89>	no one would blame you unless there's actual licensing issue :p
<jushur>	falu: the trackpad or the pin middle of the keyboard?

<binero>	hello, when running cheese i get an error: "one ore more needed gstreamer elements are missing: cluttervideosink."
<ffledgling>	so, i was trying to setup a package from aur and it has an unmet dependency when i do makepkg -s
<binero>	is this a missing dependency? how to fix it? i already searched the wiki and the net.
<ffledgling>	the library in question is also on aur, but my question is, do i need to always hunt these down manually and install them?
<ffledgling>	since they're not in the community or core repos pacman can't work with them
<wasamasa>	that's the recommended way
<sledgehammer>	ffledgling, initially yes. once you know what you're doing, you can use an aur helper to autoamte stuff
<ffledgling>	sledgehammer: okay, so i already installed a package using the usual aur way, makepkg -s pacman -u
<sledgehammer>	good for you
<wasamasa>	using an aur helper automating it would be an alternative, but that ills kittens
<ffledgling>	how many more should i try to do by hand before i consider moving to helper?
<wasamasa>	*kills
<sledgehammer>	ffledgling, all of them
<ffledgling>	sledgehammer: all of them?
<sledgehammer>	ffledgling, you meant how many more dependencies right?
<ffledgling>	no, i meant, say i install this one and all it's deps by hand, how many times should i do this before i can say okay, got this and the subtleties, using aur helper now
<sledgehammer>	ffledgling, that's entirely up to you
<sledgehammer>	whenever you feel comfortable with it
<ffledgling>	i see, so i'll probably do this for a week or two then i guess
<sledgehammer>	i'd recommend you go for cower first - it's a very useful tool, but it doesn't get in your way. after that, you can go for something with more bells and whistles, but it really depends how much you plan to use the aur
<viderizer>	is there a cli keepass viewer
<wasamasa>	!give viderizer g cli keepass viewer

<ffledgling>	sledgehammer: probably fairly frequently
<mcsalty>	hi, i'm having trouble getting vnc to work with remmina. do i have to do something special to get it work?
<trevir>	i like packer for a pacman like it can install native are apps to or you can tell it aur only it does resolving on aur and arch
<trevir>	but ya you should learn about building and resolving issues that may arise
<ffledgling>	trevir: fair enough
<cryptopsy>	does firefox have a config file so i can change the location and names of te folders it creates in ~ ?
<cryptopsy>	for example i don't want the download folder, i wanna put downloads elsewhere
<zer0rest>	cryptopsy, https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xdg_user_directories
<phrik>	title: xdg user directories - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<talented>	firefox in it's settings, you can be asked where to download, but default is set to your downloads automatically without asking
<talented>	is that what you mean?
<zer0rest>	talented, no, he means the ~/downloads and ~/desktop folder, you can change that
<cryptopsy>	where's the firefox about:config saved, is what imean
<zer0rest>	cryptopsy, you don't change it in about:config, you change it by setting xdg_download_dir
<cryptopsy>	y?
<zer0rest>	that's the standard, firefox follows it at least for the downloads and desktop directory
<wasamasa>	firefox (and everything else relevant) follows the xdg standard
<wasamasa>	be happy about it, you sillyhat
<cryptopsy>	so where's the config file?
<zer0rest>	cryptopsy, read the wiki article https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xdg_user_directories
<phrik>	title: xdg user directories - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<cryptopsy>	don't wanna type capital letter everytime i have to autocomplete those folders, xdg can suck it
<zer0rest>	cryptopsy, read the damn article, you can change it
<zer0rest>	xdg is flexible
<doctorjellyface>	what command would you use in a pkgbuild to install a folder that contains another two folders which contain some files?
<cryptopsy>	i read the article i wanna know where firefox has its config
<doctorjellyface>	cryptospy .mozilla/<profile> i guess
<weust>	i set up arch linux using a static ip address, but the beginner's guide does not mention how or where to add the search domain part. how is this done in arch linux?
<toqoz>	j
<talented>	what dual mean in arch, is that just 32/64?
<weust>	talented: was wondering that too :-)
<talented>	yea, i just downloaded it, was thinking netboot was a minimal install but seems not what i expected so opted for the norm
<tigrmesh>	talented, yes
<tigr>	talented, yes.  dual does mean  32/64
<talented>	thanks tigrmesh/tigr
<tigr>	you're welcome, talented   :)
<talented>	do you need to set search domain wuest? i've never needed a reason to set that for a static ip, your mileage maybe different
<weust>	i want to be able to resolve machines in my network by just the hostname, not the fqdn
<weust>	hence the need to search domain
<cryptopsy>	where should i rebind ctrl-d to alt-d ?
<tigr>	i'm not sure what you mean.  are you asking about a download mirror, talented ?
<weust>	resolving based on fqdn works btw
<talented>	well there's a netboot.iso, but it's pxe booting, i was wondering if this is a minimal way to install your packages
<talented>	fedora has a netinstall.iso, but this is installing the core and then getting the packages you choose from the internet
<talented>	not that it matters, it's my first time trying arch, but i usually always start minimal and then bloat it
<tigrmesh>	the install cd gets pretty much everything from the internet
<talented>	oh ok, it did seem a bit small in size compared to others
<trevir>	at least its bloat you want
<gffa>	obligatory "that's what she said" joke.
<talented>	not good if it's your wife saying it
<namarrgon>	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ceunuymviainiek.jpg:large

<ingar>	hi, i'm getting an nfs error /var/lib/nfs is owned by root, what should be its owner?
<namarrgon>	where do you see that error?
<ingar>	journal, but it's just a warning it seems, the actual error is "failed to create rpc listeners, exiting"
<ingar>	rpc.statd
<namarrgon>	post the log
<weust>	boot cleans the screen before the login prompt, and my smb share won't mount, so i can't see the error. what log should i be looking at? can't seem to find the correct one
<namarrgon>	systemctl --failed
<weust>	ok
<jeromelanteri>	namarrgon: i can sell for you malakit (for only 1000 $.. it's cheap...) lol
<weust>	thnx
<namarrgon>	jeromelanteri: does it support linux?
<jeromelanteri>	option for 100 $... yes
<ingar>	namarrgon: fixed, needed to enable rpcvind
<namarrgon>	deal!

<utack>	does someone know how to limit shutdown time for tasks before killing them? a normal shutdown can take up to 30sec for me, and i want it to just kill all tasks after 3sec max
<utack>	i only found a shutdown time limit for services
<antranigv>	after the grub screen i get /dev/sda1: clean, but nothing else. any advice?
<weust>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/samba#add_share_to_.2fetc.2ffstab nasty if you can't set an option to wait for the network to be up before attempting the mount of a cifs share. nfs has an option for it
<phrik>	title: samba - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<antranigv>	i did do fsck.ext2 /dev/sda1 from a liveos
<rkreis>	weust, i believe you can accomplish that with systemd
<rkreis>	it kind of takes over /etc/fstab anyway (and creates unit files based on it)
<weust>	read something about that. and i know that you can set it up to wait for the network to be up. i will look at that.
<weust>	most of the documentation, not just arch linux, just says to put it in the fstab file, and that's it...
<monkehparade>	uhm, hey.
<monkehparade>	i have a question, that is more linux related than to arch specifically, and i just wanted some help.
<dagle>	!give monkehparade ask
<phrik>	monkehparade: don't ask to ask, if anyone is here or alive, or uses something. just ask, and we'll get moving along. thanks.
<monkehparade>	i just wanted to make sure before i ask.
<monkehparade>	i'm trying to extend my root partition because i'm running out of space.
<dagle>	asking about asking something that is offtopic isn't that much better. .p
<monkehparade>	.. but i have problems, and more importantly, i don't know how.

<phrik>	title: harddisk.md (at gist.github.com)
<dagle>	so /dev/sda8 is your root?
<monkehparade>	yes, dagle
<talented>	so really you just want to increase sda8 with your free space
<monkehparade>	yes.
<monkehparade>	.. with the 22.38gb unallocated space.
<dagle>	monkehparade: delete the swap, resize, do fs resize and create a new swap.
<dagle>	the allocated space can only be added to sda7 and sda6, not sda8.
<ch_ris>	thank you guys
<monkehparade>	i understand what you mean, but i don't really know how to do it, dagle.
<talented>	is that an ext4 limitation?
<monkehparade>	the swap, resize and fs resize part.
<aardwolf>	hi, i read the archwiki about it, but it's still not clear to me. if i add something to crontab, what could be a reason why it does not get executed? the archwiki mentions the "cronie" daemon, but mentions that that one is for cron.daily etc..., while i'm speaking about "crontab -e" here. thanks!
<dagle>	talented: partions have nothing to do with the filesystem.
<cukier>	can you resize / without livecd?
<monkehparade>	cukier, i think you can.
<talented>	yea, but you say you can only increase by what it seems it has to be next to the partition
<monkehparade>	.. i read somewhere that it support it.
<monkehparade>	*supports
<ch_ris>	d_garbage thank you
<dagle>	resizing a mounted partion a good thing to do.
<dagle>	talented: yes?
<killamachine>	does anybody know if there's a way to have a different panel for each workspace? all i found on google was 1 unanswered question
<dagle>	isn't a good thing to do*
<dagle>	killamachine: sounds like you want something that isn't a panel at all but only looks like a panel.
<monkehparade>	dagle, may i ask if you could help me do all that?
<dagle>	monkehparade: select the swap and delete it
<monkehparade>	dagle, already did that.
<dagle>	now just google on how to expand the filesystem and follow that guide.
<killamachine>	deagle, well i want a panel, but i want the shortcuts i have in it differe on each workspace
<killamachine>	differ*
<talented>	so unallocated space should be ~26.19?
<monkehparade>	dagle, do i have to do this on a live cd, or would be a problem if i did it within linux itselt.
<talented>	monkehparade, live, you need to unmount the filesystem
<dagle>	monkehparade: you should do it from a livecd.
<monkehparade>	so i'll do this using the gparted live cd.
<killamachine>	well he could probably do it also while in his linux installation, as long he has the filesystems not mounted :p
<killamachine>	or drives or what it's called
<weust>	rkreis: got it working with systemd now. added noauto,x-systemd.automount to the line. works good enough for me
<monkehparade>	alot of the articles regarding extending the filesystem are if they use lvm.
<talented>	i use lvm heh

<phrik>	monkehparade: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-resizing-partitions-1/ and http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-resizing-partitions-2/
<talented>	that's why i thought it's odd needing the space next to what you need to increase
<earnestly>	rod smith himself
<earnestly>	(gdisk/refind programmer)
<talented>	i assume partitions do not get relabelled?
<monkehparade>	thank you earnestly
<peaveyman>	how long does it usually take for a package to get updated once it's flagged out of date
<junka>	i cant shutdown properly
<arch-tk>	is "-" some magic filename? touch - return 0 and doesn't make a file named -, vim - ends up with "vim: reading from stdin...", in libcurl curl_formadd(bla..., curlform_file, "-") ends up reading from stdin but fopen("-", "r") fails with no such file or directory.
<arch-tk>	can you actually physically not make a file called - ?
<junka>	my shutdown is blocked by info: task kowrker/0:3:1877
<holomorph>	as long as it takes
<junka>	^
<arch-tk>	wait, no, i made a file called -
<arch-tk>	i can't edit it :d
<arch-tk>	with vim at least
<earnestly>	--
<arch-tk>	interesting
<earnestly>	(might work, or just "quote" it, that is, ./-)
<dagle>	arch-tk: - is just a convention.
<earnestly>	-- is the posix requirement for command-line programs to stop reading arguments
<arch-tk>	earnestly: so how do i tell if curlform_file will take - to mean stdin or a file named -
<earnestly>	./-
<arch-tk>	dagle: that's what i thought, until weird things happened.
<earnestly>	that's how you 'quote'
<arch-tk>	in any case.
<arch-tk>	earnestly: thanks.
<earnestly>	basically you give it a path
<earnestly>	like with ./executabls
<arch-tk>	earnestly: i need to go now :p
<dagle>	arch-tk: "weird things"?
<arch-tk>	dagle: nevermind
<dagle>	it's a highlevel construct in the unix enviorment or what to call it.
<earnestly>	dagle: is - a standard anywhere to mean 'stdin' or is it just a defacto one?
<earnestly>	i know - is part of the sus portable filename characters
<monkehparade>	now that i've resized the partition, how do i resize the file system?
<earnestly>	depends on the filesystem
<holomorph>	depends on the file system
<dagle>	earnestly: i bet it could mean nothing also.
<holomorph>	._.
<earnestly>	hehe
<dagle>	if stdin isn't a valid source.
<earnestly>	dagle: well, assuming that stdin is valid

<earnestly>	those articles do talk about ext4 and give examples iirc
<earnestly>	but yeah, that
<talented>	monkehparade, boot from a livecd with gparted, click partition to change, resize/move, increase space to what you want
<talented>	just hope nothing important is on there, because you could lose it if it's not backed up
<monkehparade>	talented, after that is done, i was told i should resize the filesystem.
<earnestly>	gparted is quite sane here since it does much of the incredibly tedious but necessary steps for you
<talented>	that is resizing
<earnestly>	gparted does resize the filesystem as well
<talented>	think the first thing you should of been told is back it up first
<earnestly>	it does all of the necessary calculation for offsets and resizes both the partition table (by recreating it) and then resizing the filesystem using the appropriate tool behind the scenes
<monkehparade>	oh, okay. that's alot of work taken off of my hands. c:
<earnestly>	monkehparade: a lot*
<earnestly>	!alot
<phrik>	http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html
<monkehparade>	thank you earnestly for clarifying that for me.
<monkehparade>	* a lot
<earnestly>	monkehparade: the articles i linked to you are just to understand the process behind it
<earnestly>	a lot of people are concerned when they're told to "recreate the partition table by deleting it" :p
<antranigv>	.dev/sda1: clean <= why is it not booting?
<earnestly>	they think they'll lose data
<earnestly>	but that's just how you resize it, remake it with new offsets, then resize the filesystem itself to fit
<earnestly>	or the other way around even
<earnestly>	but that inolves lots of tedious calculation, making sure you're aligned, blegh.  gparted does all of that for you
<talented>	antranigv, any more information on how you came to your conclusion it's not booting?
<earnestly>	[it's still worth knowing how it works, imo]
<earnestly>	[from a purely pedagogical point of view]
<monkehparade>	earnestly, i think i'd love an alot. where can i get one of those? do they breed them in japan? can i have one shipped?
<antranigv>	talented: it says "systemd-fsck: /dev/sda1: clean, {some block stuff}" and nothing more :-/
<earnestly>	alot is always with you in your heart
<antranigv>	it's in a vm btw (:
<dagle>	pulseaudio and steam games... oh the hate.
<talented>	it seems it has booted, but a problematic shutdown wants it to check/repair that drive, seems something wrong with your virtual drivfe
<antranigv>	talented: anything you advice? it's new, so i'm ok with reinstalling it.
<antranigv>	just want to test archlinux/parabola with lxde (:
<earnestly>	parabola is kind of a different distro which may do things in different ways which might eventually cause your seemingly unbooting system

<gulzar>	i have some problem with libreoffice. i uninstalled libreoffice-still but lowriter exist in /usr/bin/lowriter and also loffice, lobase etc. what i have done wrong? i just did pacman -rns libreoffice-still. because lo was giving some java problem
<gulzar>	anyone?
<gulzar>	!ping
<phrik>	gulzar: ping [--c <count>] [--i <interval>] [--t <ttl>] [--w <timeout>] <host or ip>
<thrice>	gulzar: people will answer if they want, don't be annoying :-)  what does "pacman -qo /usr/bin/lowriter" say?
<uelo>	uh uh, i know this: pong!
<gulzar>	thrice: sorry, i have some urgent job and office is not working
<gulzar>	thrice: error: no package owns /usr/bin/lowriter
<thrice>	you should pay someone, rather than depending on irc then
<gulzar>	thrice: seems like somewhere i screwed my system
<thrice>	are the old lo remnants only in /usr/bin/ ?
<thrice>	do you have eg. /usr/lib/libreoffice  still?
<gulzar>	thrice: they are in /usr/bin and /usr/share/man/
<thrice>	if nothing owns the files, just remove them by hand
<thrice>	something must have gone wrong during the removal, i guess
<gulzar>	thrice: sorry i lost connection, yes i have /usr/lib/libreoffice
<gulzar>	thrice: so is it safe to rm that manually
<thrice>	just to be sure:  pacman -qs libreoffice   ?
<gulzar>	thrice: nothing
<thrice>	something went wrong during the removal, i guess
<thrice>	about all you can do is remove the files
<gulzar>	thrice: ok
<gulzar>	thrice: thank you, during that change few days back , lo was screwed.
<poeticallyevil>	hi, in /etc/mke2fs.conf there is a section "ext4" and another section "largefile". if i were to create a fs with mkfs.ext4 -t largefile, will the "features" of "ext4" be used ?
<grawity>	i think so
<iterati>	hello. so, my sister closed her machine with the power button after mouse was unresponding. now getting "can't access tty job control turned off" and rootfs shell without (i guess) commands like fdisk or lsblk
<grawity>	since it already chooses one automatically
<iterati>	you think it's disk fault or something like: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman#.22unable_to_find_root_device.22_error_after_rebooting
<phrik>	title: pacman - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<grawity>	iterati: i think you need to read the entire screen, not just the last line about "job control"
<grawity>	iterati: this sounds like the initramfs emergency shell, but somewhere it should say why exactly it went into that
<iterati>	grawity, yeah, i live in different city, i installed arch there, but now i don't have access to computer :)
<iterati>	well, apparently the disk is not damaged (ot totally), something else is going on
<dan39>	is there a like "live ls" utility? so pretty much polling "ls -l" or similar... could use inotify, but then we wouldnt know the file sizes id think
<earnestly>	dan39: well, what do you want to do?
<namarrgon>	iterati: if you use kernel-names for root= then you should switch to uuids or lables
<dan39>	i could just bash loop ls -l haha...
<earnestly>	dan39: but why?
<mattapp13>	hey guys, i recently bought an edimax usb wireless dongle, and i am finding that it drops connections frequently, or just slows down to a stop
<dan39>	earnestly: just watch a directory and see new files being created/deleted
<earnestly>	dan39: use ranger then
<earnestly>	miller columns are nice as well
<cukier>	dan39: $watch ls ?
<talented>	so created a usb stick of arch, booted it, got a menu saying failed to start loader, says i need to enrol it's hash, i assume i select loader.efi?
<iterati>	namarrgon: it's normal to that rootfs not to hav
<iterati>	not to have /dev/disk  ?
<grawity>	/dev/disk is created by udev
<heftig>	talented: disable secure boot
<grawity>	so you'll have it only if the initramfs crashed after starting udev, not before
<poeticallyevil>	grawity: thank you for your reply. i found the answer in man (8) mke2fs.conf (tl;dr : yes, they will.).
<talented>	can i do it with secure boot?
<earnestly>	cukier: watch(1) is nice, but i wanted to try get to the heart of the issue and see if there's a nicer solution than executing a command repeatidly.  ranger will poll and seems more inline with his overall need
<heftig>	it's a headache
<talented>	ok, don't want headaches, just curious really
<earnestly>	!give talented g gregkh secure boot kernel signed
<phrik>	talented: booting a self-signed linux kernel - linux kernel monkey log: <http://kroah.com/log/blog/2013/09/02/booting-a-self-signed-linux-kernel>
<dan39>	yea, but i thought maybe there would be a separate utility to do that same thing, so that didnt have to run program repeatedly and program stayed running.  not sure if that matters. i guess ls is a pretty quick lightweight program that can be polled quickly without much worry
<iterati>	grawity so from that shell is possible to mount any partitions (and find fstab in case something wrong there) or need to boot with usb stick or cd ?
<earnestly>	dan39: like i said, ranger might be exactly what you want
<grawity>	dan39: well, what stops you from using inotify and checking the size of every new file?
<talented>	this laptop had linux mint running in secure boot, even they recommended turning it off but i got around it
<earnestly>	grawity: i thought it might be that, but it appears he just wants a general solution
<dan39>	grawity: nothing... but why code it myself if it already exists...
<earnestly>	grawity: that is, he's not watching files for any reason, just "because"
<dan39>	cukier: thanks for reminding me of `watch` tho, forgot about that one <_<
<weust>	i am out. good bye
<cukier>	no problem. :)
<earnestly>	dan39: apply this to everything: https://pbrisbin.com/posts/faster_mail/

<mattapp13>	hey guys, i recently bought an edimax usb wireless dongle, and i am finding that it drops connections frequently, or just slows down to a stop
<namarrgon>	iterati: rebuild the initramfs, just in case
<namarrgon>	iterati: can you access your /-partition in the shell? mount it to /new_root and continue the boot
<namarrgon>	charlesatum: intel cpu?
<charlesatum>	yes, ivy bridge
<charlesatum>	latest microcode
<talented>	so booted it, am in a terminal with root autologged in, take it that's the norm?
<iterati>	namarrgon: apparebntly there isn't home, ls doesn't find it. i dont remember if root and home were separate though
<talented>	following the installation guide, but nothing really telling me what i'm going to expect
<namarrgon>	iterati: /home isn't important, you can fix that later
<namarrgon>	talented: follow the beginners' guide if the 'installation guide' is too sparse
<iterati>	it'as in english the installation and they don't know english well my sister and trying to find out from the phone, messy kinda :)
<iterati>	something like root partition with errors and fsck i think
<talented>	thanks, first time installing arch, not really sure what i'm expecting
<sudokode>	happy mothers' day!
<charlesatum>	ok, so i'm running gdb on it with the help of coredumpctl
<sudokode>	or 's
<sudokode>	no one really knows
<earnestly>	american mothers' day
<charlesatum>	it = last gnome-shell coredump
<earnestly>	?
<sudokode>	earnestly: yeah, you have to be an american mom to be cool like that
<earnestly>	mothering sunday was march 6th
<charlesatum>	well, i now it's the brazilian one
<sudokode>	lol mothering sunday
<sudokode>	that's why yours isn't as popular
<teraflop>	xd
<sudokode>	you might as well call it breastfeeding sunday
<earnestly>	apparently they're different
<charlesatum>	anyway, got this:
<charlesatum>	core was generated by `/usr/bin/gnome-shell'.
<earnestly>	mother's day is some modern thing
<charlesatum>	program terminated with signal sigtrap, trace/breakpoint trap.

<holomorph>	let's make yo mama jokes
<talented>	am i suppose to be in a terminal? wasn't paying attention so never saw an arch menu
<earnestly>	hmm
<holomorph>	!give talented beginners
<phrik>	talented: read this! all of it, twice! your answer is probably here! http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/beginners%27_guide
<earnestly>	sudokode: mother's day is apparently a 20th century american thing, interesting
<sudokode>	yep
<namarrgon>	charlesatum: post the full backtrace to a paste-service
<sudokode>	earnestly: funny story, the woman that helped get it made a holiday tried to get rid of it later on
<earnestly>	sudokode: and it's similar to, but different to all the other places in the world which celebrate the same thing, and have been doing for thousands of years.  hmm
<teraflop>	go burn your money in presents because it's nobodygivesafuckmothersday xd
<sudokode>	i don't know the full story, just that factoid
<talented>	i'm in the guide, but wasn't paying attention and doesn't say whether i should be in terminal or not, missed the arch boot menu, so wondering if i need to reboot or this is where i need to be
<iterati>	it reports that fsch not found... is that the normal ? before the errors it asks to run something liek fsck /dev/sda3 manually
<charlesatum>	namarrgon: how do i get the full stack trace using gdb on the coredump?
<earnestly>	sudokode: i guess any civilisation eventually gains one
<namarrgon>	charlesatum: 'bt'
<holomorph>	talented: reboot and pay attention then
<jupelius>	earnestly: one mother's day?
<sudokode>	earnestly: remember we're an amalgamation of a country
<hyo0301>	noobs
<namarrgon>	iterati: trying to mount it to /new_root?
<earnestly>	sudokode: the uk version is still based on the catholic thingie, about he 4th day of lent
<sudokode>	and holidays as we know them today are simply federal implementations of old traditions
<sudokode>	i.e. christmas, thanksgiving, easter
<iterati>	namarrgon: how exactly ?
<earnestly>	or fourth sundny of lent*
<earnestly>	sudokode: "bank holidies" :p
<sudokode>	yeah, i'm not sure where our dates came from for mother's and father's days
<earnestly>	holidays*
<namarrgon>	iterati: i mean, when do you get the fsck error-message?
<sudokode>	earnestly: well, banks are closed on sundays
<sudokode>	so it doesn't help them
<earnestly>	sudokode: they have various holidays on mondays as well
<sudokode>	sure
<iterati>	namarrgon: just after boot, root  with errors etc... and it drops to rootfs shell
<earnestly>	sudokode: a national holiday
<iterati>	without many commands available
<earnestly>	sudokode: imagine having holidays based on your for-profit corporation?
<earnestly>	sudokode: now that's power
<namarrgon>	iterati: you're not using the fsck hook?
<earnestly>	not that i'm complaining ;p
<sudokode>	i imagine it'd be the same thing as my dream of having sex with angelina jolie on a pile of money
<sudokode>	talk about a holiday
<earnestly>	sudokode: bio-social tickets
<sudokode>	heh
<iterati>	namarrgon: apparrently not... trouble is that i installed it 3 years ago i think and now i am trying to see if possible to fix via phone, not easy :)
<talented>	wow, rebooted and had like 1 second to see the menu, nice
<talented>	back in the same spot
<sudokode>	talented: change the timeout?
<namarrgon>	iterati: then you need to boot something you can fsck the partition from
<talented>	it's usb media that i just put arch on, first installation, well trying to be
<namarrgon>	talented: the terminal is all you get
<talented>	that's what i asked before
<talented>	but thanks
<wasamasa>	sudokode: my sister insists that it's not to promote capitalism and rather helping flower shops
<wasamasa>	sudokode: as it's a pretty crappy job that doesn't pay well at all
<sudokode>	wasamasa: i don't see how that helps the workers rather than the business
<cukier>	talented: "you will be presented with a zsh shell prompt, logged in as the root user. "
<sudokode>	most flower shops aren't small places anymore
<talented>	my bad, it's in the guide, i'm trying to skim through all the blah in it though
<sudokode>	you can order an arrangement of flowers from a shop in cali for a funeral in florida

<tomty89>	sudokode: woo exciting
<jupelius>	wasamasa: didn't understand
<sudokode>	tomty89: less exciting when you're not part of the show :d
<holomorph>	talented: if you're not going to bother reading the guide, you're gonna have a bad time

<jupelius>	i also learned a new word: fragrance
<wasamasa>	jupelius: i know that it's hard to believe, but there are philosophers that were pretty cool guys
<holomorph>	socrates didn't afraid of anything
<namarrgon>	charlesatum: the system is up to date?
<jupelius>	my favourite is... the guy i don't remember now
<talented>	it needs a quick guide, there's so much non essential information, even the sparse installation guide just lots of blocks of bits and pieces all over the place
<wasamasa>	holomorph: he doesn't have the appearance of james dean though, does he
<jupelius>	the man who lived in a barrel and focused on the essential parts of life
<jupelius>	like masturbating in the public
<tomty89>	bear
<wasamasa>	hahaha
<charlesatum>	namarrgon: ran pacman -syu yesterday
<wasamasa>	i've heard he was also great at annoying people throughout the day
<pid1>	is there a way to disable markdown's lazy list numbering?
<pid1>	i have something ordered 7-1, and i would like it to stay that way in the exported file.
<earnestly>	use rst
<earnestly>	markdown is badly designed anyway
<pid1>	^i'm starting to notice that, unfortunately.
<holomorph>	let's delimit urls with parentheses, what could go wrong!
<jupelius>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diogenes_of_sinope this guy
<phrik>	title: diogenes of sinope - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (at en.wikipedia.org)
<earnestly>	asciidoc isn't bad either
<sudokode>	holomorph: lol ironic nick
<sudokode>	i just noticed that
<namarrgon>	charlesatum: is this on real hw or in a vm?
<holomorph>	sudokode: ikr
<charlesatum>	real hardware
<wasamasa>	"he became notorious for his philosophical stunts such as carrying a lamp in the daytime, claiming to be looking for an honest man."
<pid1>	earnestly, any pro/cons between the two? this is just simple notetaking, though inline latex would be handy.
<wasamasa>	pid1: markdown was designed to be ambiguous, rst wasn't
<pid1>	i meant rst and asciidoc.
<earnestly>	there's also commonmark, which is basically pandoc-markdown
<earnestly>	which is not too terrible
<earnestly>	pid1: there's not much difference
<sudokode>	i'm sure they'd appreciate the compliment
<earnestly>	rst gets url delimiters right
<earnestly>	pid1: or just use latex, it's not that bad, imo
<earnestly>	as a markup
<earnestly>	depends on what it's for i suppose
<pid1>	i use latex as well, though usually for things like linear algebra or computer architecture notes.
<pid1>	this is just plaintext ccna notes, so latex is a bit more than i need.
<pid1>	i didn't realize markdown would choke on a list ordered 7 to 1.
<polyzen>	pid1, tried rest
<polyzen>	?*
<pid1>	polyzen, earnestly just recommended that. i'm looking into it.
<earnestly>	i'm not sure it can do reverse auto-enumeration either
<pid1>	it looks quite nice.
<polyzen>	woops :p
<earnestly>	or well, you can manually write 7. foobar
<charlesatum>	brb, lunch.
<charlesatum>	actually, *be back in an hour
<pid1>	earnestly, i have everything manually entered in that list.
<charlesatum>	(or more)
<tomty89>	won't miss you
<earnestly>	pid1: oh, weird
<pid1>	i figured markdown would be smart enough to ignore it.
<pid1>	clearly not.
<earnestly>	pid1: depends on what you're using
<pid1>	rst looks nice, though. i'll give it a shot.
<polyzen>	^
<earnestly>	markdown.pl is total rubbish
<earnestly>	pandoc is pretty good
<polyzen>	could get the tool to work properly
<earnestly>	or just, commonmark now
<earnestly>	which has a small c program which does the generation
<earnestly>	if you don't want ghc
<pid1>	i was looking into the pandoc packages.
<pid1>	i remember you complaining about the haskell situation on arch, iirc.
<pid1>	i'm assuming pandoc-static would be recommended.
<earnestly>	pid1: nah
<earnestly>	pid1: i'd still use cabal for pandoc
<earnestly>	it's also not just on arch, cabal is a mess everywhere :p
<ch_ris>	here we go again...
<bougyman>	pid1: i had some js lying around which handled ordering of li's.
<bougyman>	it wasn't for md specifically, but it just uses some js to add value=<number> to the <li> tags.
<bougyman>	should be easy to hack up yourself.
<pid1>	thanks bougyman. i probably can, but this is just some quick study notes that i wanted to have in a nice format when i print them.
<bougyman>	could always just use <li value="7"> directly, then.
<earnestly>	pid1: well, at least if you want markdown, use commonmark
<pid1>	^will do, thanks.
<pid1>	i might just be a barbarian and use libreoffice.
<earnestly>	pid1: i have my own weird markup: http://sprunge.us/klrw
<earnestly>	pid1: http://sprunge.us/fpvo sort of
<earnestly>	pid1: the numbers are line count
<earnestly>	sorry, line number*
<pid1>	looks nice!
<earnestly>	it's basically just rfc
<wasamasa>	without page numbers!
<dongerino>	has anyone here done c++ opengl dev?
<earnestly>	wasamasa: uses line numbers instead
<wasamasa>	earnestly: yeah, i prefer it that way
<wasamasa>	earnestly: better than mimicking a printed document
<oozbooz>	how one can find which packages require kwallet, ktheme, ketc... ?
<earnestly>	wasamasa: i could use in-line numbers that work with gf/gf commands but it's a bit ugly as you have to repeat the filename
<oozbooz>	i am running mate
<grawity>	oozbooz: pacman -qi them
<earnestly>	pid1: (the idea is to make it look nice printed without needing formatting.  it's sort of inspired by a lot of the manuals that bitsavers.org puts out, from the olde worlde days of computering)
<pid1>	i did the same thing with the version of my resume that i put on my website.
<pid1>	if it doesn't read great in lynx, i'm not interested.
<wasamasa>	if it doesn't read great in m-x eww, the blog is crappily designed
<ruan>	emacs browser is called eww?
<wasamasa>	a relatively new one, yes
<holomorph>	ruan: yes. emacs web wowser
<wasamasa>	before that there were w3 (pure elisp) and w3m (peruses the binary)

<holomorph>	wasamasa: looks good to me o/
<wasamasa>	holomorph: doesn't surprise me considering the only hacks i did were some css to stick the footer to the bottom
<demize>	earnestly: if you do something more like https://ptpb.pw/6hu- you can use the rfc vim plugin, which lets you eg, \g to jump to a section
<demize>	also does some highlighting
<earnestly>	demize: oh yeah, i'd do all of that stuff
<earnestly>	hm
<wasamasa>	hmm, emacs got a rfc package, too
<earnestly>	demize: i'd probably do my own
<wasamasa>	but i bet its code is ugly as hell :p
<demize>	earnestly: https://theos.kyriasis.com/~kyrias/s/2xdvomk7es.png with syntax highlighting
<earnestly>	demize: that said, doing numbering like that isn't a bad idea
<holomorph>	wasamasa: there are like half a dozen of them and they are all terrifying
<demize>	yeah, i think the vim one is sort of ugly as well.
<oozbooz>	gravity, thanks... print-manager requires all bunch of kde framework files

<david64bit>	hi...i'm having some trouble and have no idea where to start with troubleshooting...i can't get into x. it just hangs and there are no error messages in /var/logs/xorg.0.log. yesterday i tried to install a different greeter for lightdm. not sure if this is connected. i can start x if i change the grub-boot line from "splash" to "text" and then "start x" but the whole system freezes up...can't switch tty and the only option is to turn of
<david64bit>	the machine
<earnestly>	demize: any top level chapter/section is ^foobar$, nothing else is
<earnestly>	demize: but that does make doing subchapters harder which is ^   subsection$.  the numbers are probably a good idea, esp if they can be generated
<earnestly>	demize: i think i will add numbers anyway, it's nice
<pid1>	earnestly, what font is that? it looks quite nice.
<demize>	earnestly: they start like that, but in the toc they are indented
<earnestly>	pid1: in demize's screenshot?
<earnestly>	demize: i'd indent the toc
<pid1>	oh sorry.
<demize>	'^\s\+\([a-z0-9.]\+\) .*$' is a rather simple regex, mmm...
<pid1>	yes, in his. i mixed up your nick and his.
<pid1>	demize, what font is that in your screenshot?

<pid1>	i'll have to check it out a little later =)
<th0rne>	anyone want to help me troubleshoot my usb audio device? it takes like a minute before it becomes active, each time i plug it in.
<th0rne>	that is, before audio out starts being directed at it. if that makes sense.
<demize>	earnestly: yeah, that looks good
<earnestly>	pid1: it was mostly just to learn opentype a little.  trying to see how small you can make fonts without them being too blurry: http://a.pomf.se/xhippc.png
<earnestly>	pid1: that's 7 though
<matse>	is it possible to disable that ncmpcpp sorts the albums in the media library by date?
<pid1>	damnit earnestly, i was going to get work done today. now i'm motivated to play around with different fonts and make a new colorscheme for i3/vim/terminal =p
<matse>	i use "genre" as primary tag and so in the second column the albums are all listed, but i have several albums which contain songs of different years and so each album is shown multiple times with just the songs in each year
<pid1>	7 looks great, though.

<demize>	wonder if it's just me or some recent regression..
<bougyman>	use install -dd instead.
<bougyman>	not sure copy can create parents in the target, but install can.
<th0rne>	hmm, ok, thanks.
<demize>	earnestly: have you seen ^ happening?
<demize>	i'm on 7.4.728.r1.9782a8aa2d7f-1
<earnestly>	demize: how do you mean resize?  which window
<matse>	there was once the option media_library_display_date            = "no"
<matse>	but since 0.6 it is not implemented in ncmpcpp anymore - that makes it more or less unusable for me :/
<demize>	earnestly: terminal window. like if i open something new so the terminal window resizes quickly, or if i just resize it slightly manually.
<earnestly>	demize: can't say that i have
<demize>	earnestly: annoying. same version?
<earnestly>	yeah
<wasamasa>	"diogenes believed human beings live artificially and hypocritically and would do well to study the dog."
<dan39>	grr tmux panes are not doing at all what i thought they would >_<
<wasamasa>	apparently, cynicism is derived from the greek word for dog
<th0rne>	what did you want them to do?
<dan39>	a pane views a window
<dan39>	but instead, a pane is in a window
<demize>	earnestly: i've almost lost quite a lot of work due to it when i've forgotten to save, but yay for swap files
<demize>	i'll try rebuilding it i guess.
<demize>	huh...
<dan39>	this may actually work better... :d
<demize>	earnestly: it just hanged there at the "caught deadly signal abrt"... attached with gdb and checked the bt and it's hanged in malloc..
<jokke>	hi
<jokke>	i'm having some trouble setting up nfs
<jokke>	i set up the bind mount etc
<jokke>	and i can see the exports of the server
<demize>	so i wonder if it is due to being out of memory.. but why would it catch an sigabrt due to that.
<jokke>	but i'm getting a permission denied error when trying to access the share after mounting
<jokke>	so mounting too works
<demize>	jokke: are the permissions on the share correct then?
<jokke>	permissions are drwxrws---+ 1 root share 196 may 10 16:50 share
<jokke>	and i'm member of the share group
<jokke>	i can access the directory on the server
<demize>	and the group has the same gid?
<jokke>	oh wait
<jokke>	aah
<jokke>	i se
<jokke>	i see
<jokke>	i need to be member of that group locally too?
<demize>	the user on the server is completely separate from the user on the client.
<earnestly>	demize: at this point i'm surprised vim even builds, everything else is a bonus
<demize>	actually, the gid and uid shouldn't matter if id mapping is turned on
<demize>	earnestly: hehe, fair point.

<demize>	mmmm
<wasamasa>	demize: i recall a discussion about vim merging neovim patches which later turned into a discussion about its behaviour on low memory
<jokke>	demize: ok
<demize>	yeah, i vaguely remember that too
<prinsen>	im tryint to enable wifi direct (p2p) under arch. whats the replacement for iwpriv _dev_ p2p_set enabled=1?
<yumbox>	how do i convert an url into a hostname, so i can ping it?
<yumbox>	e.g. ping 'https://www.google.com/' doesn't work, but ping 'www.google.com' does.
<teraflop>	^
<jokke>	demize: i have the same problem with samba...
<talented>	where is that string coming from?
<talented>	@yumbox
<yumbox>	talented: i have a file with lines of url's
<jokke>	demize: not sure how to handle this now..
<demize>	jokke: uhm, why would switching to samba change the underlying problem?
<talented>	ok, so you want just the basename and probably no duplicates?
<talented>	hostname*
<yumbox>	talented: yup
<earnestly>	wasamasa: got a link handy?
<jokke>	demize: well, i thought samba would actually map the samba user to the local user
<earnestly>	wasamasa: have i showed you that actor model paper by gul yet?
<jokke>	and thus give the same permissions as the local user
<talented>	is ping the command you are using?
<wasamasa>	earnestly: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/vim_dev/1abcxzn6ej4/qg4aqvddozcj
<phrik>	title: google groups (at groups.google.com)
<talented>	just you'll forever be pinging
<wasamasa>	earnestly: i don't think so
<yumbox>	talented: i'm using ping, yeah.
<jokke>	demize: basically i need every user on the remote machine that belongs to the group "share" to be able to access the directory
<yumbox>	talented: i can use -c 1 or something
<jokke>	demize: how can i accomplish this? :/
<earnestly>	wasamasa: http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/6952 (actually implements two flavours (algol and lisp-like) actor languages and uses them to explain it.  it's a very interesting read (that is, i find it personally interesting after all the other stuff.)  turns out i knew nothing about the actor model
<demize>	jokke: and did you actually add the group as a valid user of the samba share?
<prinsen>	anyone who have got wifi p2p to work?
<jokke>	demize: not sure i know what you mean
<demize>	jokke: i'm talking about configuring samba properly..
<demize>	!g samba users security
<phrik>	demize: chapter 9. users and security - samba: <https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/using_samba/ch09.html>
<demize>	jokke: ^ read that.
<jokke>	will do
<grawity>	"read list = @share"
<earnestly>	oooh, neovim wants to use jemalloc
<earnestly>	yayness
<talented>	yumbox, how are you reading those urls into the command?
<yumbox>	talented: cat list.txt | xargs ping
<earnestly>	demize: heh, i sort of have a habit of saving all the time, because sometimes when thinking i have nothing better to do, it also triggers syntastic
<ambsace>	sed 's/http[s]*\:\/\///g'
<jokke>	demize: i added valid users = @share
<yumbox>	talented: or xargs <list.txt ping
<earnestly>	demize: btw, http://ponylang.org/papers/opsla237-clebsch.pdf is also interesting
<jokke>	demize: but i still get the permission denied error
<earnestly>	heh: "when i just had my amiga i installed some tools, such as a csh implementation, that didn't check for running out of memory.  the author said it wasn't needed, because the amiga has 1 mbyte of memory so you would never run out!"
<demize>	jokke: and you restarted it?
<demize>	earnestly: yeah, but sometimes i don't save for a while when i have a lot of things on my mind
<braindamage>	prinsen: see the docs, a very narrow set of wifi drivers support it
<demize>	or writing non-code and have a lot to write out
<earnestly>	wasamasa: the languages the paper implements is sal and act.  act is the lisp-like, based on act3 by carl hewitt
<earnestly>	demize: it's pretty much muscle memory now, i don't even think about doing it, and yeah, it's caused issues for when i meant to use :sav ;/
<talented>	yumbox, are they all in urls? or could you expect just something.com
<yumbox>	they're all urls
<wasamasa>	earnestly: is it one of the m-expression based lisps?
<polyzen>	can i edit the ncurses pkgbuild to enable italics, as opposed to using ncurses-git?
<earnestly>	wasamasa: i'm not sure
<earnestly>	polyzen: my ncurses-git package is good :p
<earnestly>	unless there's problems?
<wasamasa>	earnestly: i wouldn't be surprised considering that's the syntax mccarthy used in his famous paper where he defined eval among other things
<polyzen>	this one if probably your's; doesn't have a maintainer line
<holomorph>	i guess the question is whether italics is in the current release
<earnestly>	nope
<pvinis>	hello. im trying to make apache work. i have the ~/public_html with correct access etc. in the apache conf i have the niclude userdir
<demize>	https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/vim_dev/dxdofqjiehe too bad, at first i thought it might be my issue..
<phrik>	title: google groups (at groups.google.com)
<pvinis>	but i get acess forbidden
<polyzen>	earnestly, no problems, just don't want the -git package if the only thing i really want is another/a-different configure flag
<polyzen>	holomorph, yes
<polyzen>	aw shucks
<earnestly>	polyzen: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ncurses-git/
<phrik>	title: aur (en) - ncurses-git (at aur.archlinux.org)
<pvinis>	when i go to localhost/~pvinis
<earnestly>	there is no configure flag for italics
<polyzen>	earnestly, that's the one
<polyzen>	alright
<earnestly>	it was added, as part of the api
<earnestly>	i doubt you'll see it until 6.0
<holomorph>	moar minimaps https://blogs.gnome.org/nacho/2015/05/10/minimap-for-gedit/
<earnestly>	also, the repo ncurses pkgbuild is kind of shit in what it provides
<earnestly>	since allan stopped maintaining it
<polyzen>	:\
<earnestly>	bart came in and just added loads of unjustified crap to it
<polyzen>	huzzah
<earnestly>	polyzen: here's a fixed gptfdisk pkgbuild for your trouble: http://sprunge.us/cads?sh
<earnestly>	which is the *only* pkgbuild in arch which uses these misguided changes to the ncurses package
<wasamasa>	earnestly: ok, no, not m-expressions either
<earnestly>	my gptfdisk package is also simpler and runs the checks
<wasamasa>	earnestly: i'm just confused since quickly scanning the document only led me to one s-expression
<pvinis>	any idea what should i try to fix my apache problem?
<earnestly>	wasamasa: i think he uses sal for the demonstration
<earnestly>	wasamasa: haven't got that far yet
<polyzen>	earnestly, why don't you put maintainer lines? :p
<earnestly>	polyzen: i don't put maintainer lines anywhere because it's dumb imo
<earnestly>	well, pointless less than dumb
<polyzen>	at least one way to see where it's from
<ambsace>	yumbox: you can try something like cat list.txt | sed 's/http[s]*\:\/\///g' | xargs ping -c 1
<earnestly>	why?
<earnestly>	anyone can just take it and change it
<ambsace>	yumbox: actually that won't work if there are directories the hostnames, nevermind
<teraflop>	pvinis: ermm, did you generate the password/s with htpasswd?
<earnestly>	ambsace: useless use of cat
<polyzen>	earnestly, that doesn't normally happen..
<pvinis>	teraflop, passwords? oo
<earnestly>	polyzen: it does for me, and that's what i care about :p
<earnestly>	polyzen: my ideals, which are probably unrealistic
<ambsace>	yes, you can just use sed
<al2o3-cr>	is there any like w-scan for arch-linux?
<prinsen>	braindamage: which docs?
<earnestly>	holomorph: these minimaps are just acme scrollbars
<polyzen>	earnestly, people normally remove your maintainer line?
<polyzen>	and don't even change it to contributor?
<earnestly>	polyzen: oh that, idk
<holomorph>	hehe
<earnestly>	polyzen: i don't include any for them to remove, so i wouldn't know
<pvinis>	teraflop: the wiki says nothing about passwords
<earnestly>	holomorph: that is, scrollbars in acme make a lot of sense and i wish more toolkits copied it
<braindamage>	!give prinsen g wifi driver p2p kernel

<earnestly>	talented: useless use of cat
<mrelendig>	useless use of cat
<talented>	i know
<earnestly>	talented: what are you tryin to do?
<talented>	but it's what he was using
<mrelendig>	if you know then stop doing it
<holomorph>	earnestly: yeah
<talented>	it's @ yumbox
<earnestly>	yumbox: hmm
<yumbox>	talented: thanks, ill give that a try.
<th0rne>	why do i get this? may 10 18:12 : server_socket: bind to '0.0.0.0:6600' failed: address already in use (continuing anyway, because binding to '[::]:6600' succeeded)
<al2o3-cr>	is there a utility to scan for channels using dvb tuner card?
<th0rne>	when doing "mpd".
<prinsen>	phrik: braindamage i have a usb dongle (rtl8192cu)
<earnestly>	yumbox: what are you trying to do exactly?
<earnestly>	yumbox: you have a list of urls with a protocol specified and you want to ping them all?
<yumbox>	earnestly: yup.
<braindamage>	!turing-test-passed
<earnestly>	yumbox: why?
<earnestly>	al2o3-cr: http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/scan
<phrik>	title: scan - linuxtvwiki (at www.linuxtv.org)
<yumbox>	earnestly: i want to find the lowest-latency mirror for a distro.
<earnestly>	yumbox: use reflector, ping is not a useful test
<earnestly>	!reflector
<phrik>	reflector -p http -c <country> --threads <number> -a 12 -f 5 --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
<earnestly>	yumbox: ping is imcp, which can be rate limited or even ignored
<lambdacomplex>	will reflector work for non-arch mirrors?
<pvinis>	any idea why i get 403 access forbidden on localhost/~pvinis even though i have userdir enabled on apache?
<al2o3-cr>	earnestly: thank you!
<earnestly>	lambdacomplex: sure
<earnestly>	should do
<mrelendig>	pvinis: because of permissions obviously
<yumbox>	earnestly: it's not for arch linux, it's for a different distro.
<earnestly>	so?
<mrelendig>	pvinis: read up on acl
<pvinis>	i have the permissions correctly set. or at least as many forums say
<mrelendig>	clearly not
<earnestly>	you may have to tweak it a bit
<yumbox>	earnestly: i was just wondering how i could convert a http url into a domain name.
<earnestly>	yumbox: ideally you'd use a proper library to do so
<talented>	yumbox, that's the awk command i gave, but basically i just handing you a loaded gun to play with really
<earnestly>	yumbox: e.g. using urlparse for pytho
<earnestly>	because people always underestimate the sheer madness of urls
<talented>	it worked in my tests, but i never removed duplicates
<yumbox>	talented: yeah, thanks, that awk command seems to work.
<earnestly>	talented: sort -u can remove duplicates
<earnestly>	you don't even need awk really
<pvinis>	mrelendig, so i should do it wil acl insteam of file permissions?
<yumbox>	however, i hoped that there was a feature of ping or curl or something that converts any url in a domain name
<teraflop>	pvinis: youre right, forget my comment
<earnestly>	talented: while read -r url; do if [[ $url =~ https://(.*) ]]; then printf '%s\n' "${bash_rematch[1]}"; done < list
<earnestly>	or well, https?:// probably
<earnestly>	yumbox: but you do realise that using ping is not a good idea?
<yumbox>	earnestly: that awk command is much easier to remember.
<yumbox>	earnestly: not really.
<earnestly>	yumbox: what protocol does ping use?
<yumbox>	icmp?
<mrelendig>	pvinis: they will make your life better
<earnestly>	right, what protocol are you downloading with?
<yumbox>	http?
<earnestly>	yumbox: is imcp the same as http?
<mrelendig>	pvinis: i bet you have forgotten that whatever user you run apache has needs +x on all the parent dirs of where you are hosting from btw
<yumbox>	earnestly: no, but latency stays the same?
<grawity>	some networks do in fact prioritize icmp to make it seem faster
<grawity>	however
<earnestly>	yumbox: and i haven't even gotten into how many people hve iptables which not only limit pings but also block them entirely
<grawity>	the *latency* is rather unimportant
<earnestly>	grawity: oh really?  the opposite
<earnestly>	i mean
<earnestly>	that's the opposite of what i expected
<grawity>	earnestly: well, both kinds exist i guess
<earnestly>	yumbox: but fundamentally they are different protocols and using one as a metric to test the other is a waste of time
<yumbox>	grawity: why is the latency unimportant?
<mrelendig>	doesn't help to have 20ms ping if you are only getting 5kb/s
<yumbox>	earnestly: i will keep it in mind.
<talented>	as i said, handing a loaded gun, didn't say my way was the best... just took what he was doing and added to it
<mrelendig>	or the mirror is plain broken, or 20 years out of date
<pvinis>	mrelendig, everything has +x until /home
<pvinis>	i will try with acl
<earnestly>	yumbox: no you won't keep it "in mind".  you won't use ping for this at all
<prinsen>	braindamage: iw list reports that p2p is supported for my dongle, but p2p_find just prints ctrl-event-scan-started several times
<yumbox>	mrelendig: yeah, that's true.
<yumbox>	mrelendig: however, i live in holland and i usually find that any server that has a low ping is located in holland or germany and almost always has good bandwidth.
<earnestly>	very curious.  you know why it's a silly idea yet you... can't seem to accept it?
<tomty89>	pvinis: what about r
<grawity>	it's a mirror that serves large downloads – most of the time is spent transferring data in one direction with an occassional ack, not continuously exchanging packets back & forth
<pvinis>	tomty89, the dirs need r?
<tomty89>	oh dirs
<tomty89>	nvm
<grawity>	so latency checks are good as a rough guide only
<pvinis>	or the files inside public_html
<talented>	earnestly, i've handed so many guns out and watched them run off and play
<tomty89>	pvinis: i think static files need r rather than x
<pvinis>	the files have +r
<earnestly>	talented: please stop doing that though
<earnestly>	talented: people very often have xyproblems, there's no point in helping them solve y because it'll just make things worse
<earnestly>	e.g. https://gist.github.com/ushkinaz/1274038
<phrik>	title: tests speed of http mirrors of cygwin (at gist.github.com)
<grawity>	i mean, it's not a *completely* stupid thing to do like earnestly argues, but it's about 50% stupid – like trying to use a thermometer as a clock
<earnestly>	grawity: but, how is it not completely the wrong thing to do?
<the_manu_212>	hi
<earnestly>	like using a thermometer as a clock
<talented>	using a thermometer as a clock doesn't sound stupid though, just being able to know the time of day by temp... kinda amazing
<tomty89>	that sounds super stupid
<talented>	but flawed too heh
<the_manu_212>	why is the official mono apckage flagged out of date and how can i get a recent version like 4?
<earnestly>	*shrug*
<talented>	if say lunch time is always your hottest time of the day, you could probably predict when it was lunch
<tomty89>	the_manu_212: build it yourself / wait
<th0rne>	how to hotedit a pacman package?
<grawity>	earnestly: latency can work as a rough measure of distance, and the shorter the distance, the smaller the chance for some part of the path to be clogged up / overused
<talented>	predict, but not be accurate
<warmwaffles>	can anyone tell me why my nfs mount is only useable by root but not my user? i've followed the wiki and i'm about to give up https://gist.github.com/warmwaffles/94eb62001620f2a1df9c
<the_manu_212>	tomty89: even if its flagged out of date about more than a month?
<phrik>	title: etc.fstab.txt (at gist.github.com)
<the_manu_212>	tomty89: even mono-git seems to be out of fate?
<earnestly>	grawity: yeah sure, i understand that line of reasoning, but isn't that oversimplfying just a tad?  lots of assumptions involved in that even about the configuration of the server
<tomty89>	the_manu_212: that happens a lot in arch :p
<tomty89>	*imho
<earnestly>	anyway, i don't think he quite understands why it's not going to help.  he might as well pick a server with a dart board
<yumbox>	warmwaffles: maybe you  need the rw flag?
<braindamage>	even bandwith is not good since it's a function of time and many isp do traffic shaping prioritizing the first n bytes of an http transfer to give more appararent website loading speed
<grawity>	we need bittorrent-based updates
<tomty89>	yumbox: rw is default
<grawity>	hell, even windows is going to have that
<earnestly>	yar
<tomty89>	yumbox: and root doesn't override ro
<grawity>	this reminds me that i really should set up wsus at $work
<earnestly>	!g wsus
<phrik>	earnestly: windows server update services home - technet - microsoft: <https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/bb332157>
<braindamage>	but honestly, it's not like chosing a mirror is super critical
<earnestly>	damnit microsoft
<tom^>	serverless repos
<tom^>	:>
<earnestly>	it has been almost a year and your ssl negotation is still unsafe
<grawity>	earnestly: basically a local mirror for windows update
<warmwaffles>	yea i've done the rw flag before and it still is super janky
<braindamage>	even if you don't get the very best ( nd it's likely to change in time ), all you have to do is find one good enough
<tomty89>	warmwaffles: permission?
<earnestly>	grawity: i'm not unsurprised but i didn't think they actually did that until you mentioned it heh
<braindamage>	therefore, even something super approximated as latency instead of troughtput can be sufficient
<earnestly>	or rather, let you do that.  but it's pretty obvious that they would
<earnestly>	braindamage: live on a tiny island, then all mirrors are fast
<yumbox>	earnestly: i think uniq can remove duplicates too (without needing to sort it).
<warmwaffles>	tomty89: yes it's mostly permissions problems. but i can't figure out why my user can't use it. my user is in the wheel group and in the storage group no dice
<earnestly>	yumbox: you have to sort to remove duplicates
<grawity>	earnestly: well, the updates are public stuff, and digitally signed
<grawity>	yumbox: or rather, uniq insists on sorting, for efficiency
<mrelendig>	unless you use python or similar
<tomty89>	warmwaffles: those doesn't mean anything
<earnestly>	yumbox: well, no.  you can use a set
<earnestly>	yumbox: but gnu sort -u is faster ;/
<yumbox>	earnestly: i don't know how uniq works internally, but it doesn't ouput sorted.
<tomty89>	warmwaffles: storage group is about raw access to block devices
<grawity>	yumbox: nobody said it outputs sorted
<warmwaffles>	oye
<grawity>	yumbox: it *asks you* to sort the stuff
<tomty89>	warmwaffles: and wheel users still can't access things doesn't belong to wheel group
<yumbox>	grawity: ?
<grawity>	yumbox: printf '%s\n' a b c b d | sort
<grawity>	err
<grawity>	yumbox: printf '%s\n' a b c b d | uniq
<grawity>	tell me if that works.
<warmwaffles>	tomty89: yea, so how do i set the permissions so that i can access it?
<grawity>	yumbox: you'd need something like `perl -ne 'print unless $seen{$_}++'` to work with unsorted data
<tomty89>	warmwaffles: no idea about nfs
<earnestly>	which is probably slower than the cost of amortised sort lol
<warmwaffles>	ahhaha
<earnestly>	grawity: but, you can do a hash too
<yumbox>	grawity: i just did a simple test like a a b c d and that worked with uniq.
<yumbox>	grawity: seems like a b c a doesn't work indeed.
<holomorph>	because uniq isn't sort
<warmwaffles>	my export on my nas is `*(rw,async,root_squash,insecure_locks,sec=sys,anonuid=1025,anongid=100)`
<grawity>	holomorph: not because of that
<earnestly>	yumbox: teapot earnest %i master ~ print a a b c d | uniq
<earnestly>	a a b c d
<grawity>	holomorph: but because it only keeps track of the last line
<holomorph>	uniq - report or omit repeated lines
<earnestly>	hmm
<grawity>	earnestly: uniq works with lines, not words
<holomorph>	idk why this is confusing
<earnestly>	oh of course
<grawity>	printf %s\\n a a b c d | uniq
<holomorph>	uniq makes it rather clear what it does
<earnestly>	yumbox: http://ix.io/it3
<earnestly>	holomorph: well, "remove repeated lines"
<teraflop>	grawity: you meant that thing? http://www.bit-tech.net/news/bits/2015/03/16/windows-10-p2p-patching/1
<yumbox>	earnestly: yeah, exactly.
<phrik>	title: windows 10 to get peer-to-peer patching | bit-tech.net (at www.bit-tech.net)
<grawity>	it does not make it clear that "repeated" implies "adjacent" until you read the whole manpage
<earnestly>	yumbox: so uniq doesn't work as you think...
<holomorph>	yumbox: so read the rest of the man page…
<holomorph>	hell, the next sentence
<earnestly>	grawity: yeah
<earnestly>	anyway, sort -u will work
<yumbox>	earnestly: yeah, it doesn't. i admitted my mistake earlier already.
<earnestly>	or set["$value"]=1
<earnestly>	;p
<earnestly>	bash can do this quite quickly, but sort -u is still very fast
<grawity>	hmm, how slow bash hashes are
<earnestly>	quite, compared with sort -u
<random-nick>	i heard that you won't be able to run unigned applications on windows 10
<pvinis>	ok, apparently, the problem was that i had public_hmtl instead of public_html
<earnestly>	however bash's will ignore trailing spaces
<yumbox>	earnestly: do you know how to filter duplicates without chaning the order in the ouput?
<yumbox>	output*
<grawity>	earnestly: which is why i gave a perl example instead
<random-nick>	unsigned*
<pvinis>	facepalm of the ultimateeeeeeee
<grawity>	yumbox: i told you 4 minutes ago
<earnestly>	grawity: that perl code is a hash?
<grawity>	yes
<earnestly>	oh
<yumbox>	grawity: sorry, i think i missed it then. what was it?
<charlesatum>	question: i wanna run a windows 7 vm for gaming. how do i know if my motherboard/processor supports vt-d?
<grawity>	yumbox: perl -ne 'print unless $seen{$_}++'
<grawity>	do you not have scrollback
<charlesatum>	i tried intel ark but there are two versions of my processor there
<earnestly>	grawity: does that do a stable deduplication?
<earnestly>	i'm not sure if bash's asso arrays would be stable...
<random-nick>	charlesatum: lscpu
<grawity>	earnestly: stable in what sense? keeping original order?
<earnestly>	grawity: yep
<grawity>	earnestly: yes, because it doesn't depend at all on the hash order, only on input order
<yumbox>	charlesatum: did you try "lscpu | grep virtualization" ?
<charlesatum>	random-nick: it shows vt-x
<talented>	yumbox, it seems to make this work, you need to do it in a script, otherwise you'll fork things up
<charlesatum>	yumbox: shows vt-x, does that mean vt-d is supported?
<grawity>	earnestly: i.e. it only checks "is this line already hashed?" for each line
<random-nick>	charlesatum: i think you should be able to run qemu with kvm on it?
<earnestly>	grawity: oh, i see what it's doing now
<tomty89>	charlesatum: vt-x doesn't imply vt-d
<charlesatum>	hmm, i have an optimus setup so i wanted to use the nvidia card on the vm
<vodik>	holomorph: well its only half a fix
<jokke>	demize: yeah
<jokke>	i did
<vodik>	holomorph: it fixes it, but its still broken :p
<charlesatum>	tomty89: is there any command i can run to check if vt-d is supported?
<yumbox>	charlesatum: http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/cs-030922.htm
<phrik>	'title: desktop boards —\r compatibility with intel� virtualization technology (intel� vt) (at www.intel.com)'
<tomty89>	charlesatum: try finding something in /proc/cpuinfo
<tomty89>	not sure if it'd be shown as vt-d or something else
<random-nick>	charlesatum: what vm are you trying to run
<tomty89>	like iommu or so *shrug*
<earnestly>	grawity: it looks like bash's asso arrays keep the order
<random-nick>	charlesatum: as in qemu, virtualbox
<yumbox>	charlesatum: i have vt-x on my intel cpu and qemu runs pretty fast.
<grawity>	earnestly: perl's used to, but started randomizing the hash function to avoid certain attacks
<charlesatum>	i wanted to use the vga passthrough thing to use the nvidia card
<earnestly>	grawity: http://ix.io/it4/sh
<charlesatum>	and for that i need to check for vt-d support
<grawity>	earnestly: same with ruby and python, afaik
<earnestly>	or not
<earnestly>	nevermind
<ryanvade>	does anyone know of an opencv_contrib package?
<random-nick>	charlesatum: yes, that's qemu
<random-nick>	charlesatum: are you following a tutorial?
<holomorph>	vodik: hehe, but i see now why it was breaking, and that the error was basically telling me what was wrong :p
<vodik>	holomorph: running emacs under x?
<holomorph>	vodik: most of the time, yes
<earnestly>	charlesatum: lspcu and use intel's ark
<earnestly>	charlesatum: e.g. lscpu = i5-2540m
<earnestly>	!g ark i5-2540m
<phrik>	earnestly: ark | intel® core™ i5-2540m processor (3m cache, up to 3.30 ghz): <http://ark.intel.com/products/50072/intel-core-i5-2540m-processor-3m-cache-up-to-3_30-ghz>
<vodik>	holomorph: then you're probably insulated from the brokenness :p
<holomorph>	vodik: something tells me bad things happen when i do pinentry things in tty emacs :(
<earnestly>	charlesatum: alternatively, check your cpuinfo for certain flags
<charlesatum>	there are two versions
<earnestly>	charlesatum: there's only one vt-d
<holomorph>	vodik: i guess since pinentry has to "take over" the tty for security reasons, or something like that
<charlesatum>	rpga and bga
<grawity>	sigh, neither top nor htop detect removed cpus
<yumbox>	grawity: what about awk '!x[$0]++' list.txt ?
<charlesatum>	two processor versions
<grawity>	yumbox: what about it
<earnestly>	charlesatum: eh
<tomty89>	charlesatum: anyway why not just try enable in your bios and or grep iommu in dmesg
<vodik>	holomorph: yeah
<grawity>	yumbox: i know perl, so you got a perl example
<yumbox>	grawity: (to sort without changing output order)
<tomty89>	s/or//
<grawity>	yumbox: if you want awk, then use awk
<yumbox>	grawity: i mean to remove duplicates, not sort
<charlesatum>	ok, brb
<grawity>	yumbox: both examples do it the exact same way though
<earnestly>	is awk's stable though?
<th0rne>	my system usually takes up to a minute to detect my usb audio device, in rare cases it doesn't detect it at all, why?
<th0rne>	*around a minute
<yumbox>	grawity: i'm not familiar with perl. is it slower/faster than awk?
<grawity>	earnestly: the exact same way
<grawity>	yumbox: i haven't measured
<grawity>	earnestly: it does not enumerate the hash contents, it only checks for existence
<grawity>	any method that actually depended on hash ordering would be much slower (due to having to read the whole input first) and therefore pointless
<holomorph>	vodik: lol pinentry pegging cpu
<tsaber>	hi suddenly my steambrowser doesn't work anymore. terminal says  .local/share/steam/ubuntu12_32/steamwebhelper: error while loading shared libraries: libgnutls.so.28: cannot open shared object file: no such file or directory
<holomorph>	rip
<tsaber>	and when i try to install lib32-gnutls28 it says the keys aren't trusted.
<tomty89>	so bump?
<sheep>	did you pacman-key --lsign the keys?\
<sheep>	oh wait no
<tsaber>	all i tried is recv key
<tsaber>	but they were already in my keyring
<tsaber>	they just aren't trusted
<ryanvade>	would someone please look at this pkgbuild for me? http://slexy.org/view/s2zowjawy3
<phrik>	title: paste // slexy 2.0 (at slexy.org)
<yumbox>	grawity: so are those perl and awk commands slower than just sort -u ?
<sheep>	makepkg shouldn't need them to be trusted
<tomty89>	tsaber: oops usr/lib/libgnutlsxx.so.28
<grawity>	yumbox: i haven't measured
<tsaber>	hmm
<tsaber>	pacman setting?
<tomty89>	so bump
<yumbox>	grawity: what about theoretically?
<tsaber>	localfilesiglevel?
<sheep>	ryanvade: remove the '-j 5' from make on line 56.  if a user has -jx in makeflags in makepkg.conf, then they'll use that
<yumbox>	ryanvade: doesn't make -j 5 depend on the cpu?
<yumbox>	sheep: beat me to it :)
<sheep>	ryanvade: makepkg will handle passing makeflags to ma
<sheep>	*make
<tomty89>	tsaber: pacman -s archlinux-keyring maybe
<ryanvade>	sheep: that was just for my own use.  does the opencv_contrib part look alright?
<grawity>	yumbox: theoretically, `sort -u` should be slower because it needs to 1) read all the lines before doing anything, 2) sort them
<tsaber>	tomty89 no got that
<charlesatum>	ok, there was just a "virtualization" option
<tomty89>	tsaber: btw guess the "xx" one is not relevant; it's more about /usr/lib/libgnutls.so.30
<sheep>	ryanvade: what part?
<yumbox>	grawity: hmm, okay.
<charlesatum>	it was already enable and i got nothing about iommu on dmesg
<holomorph>	ryanvade: you know there's a repo package which actually has separate package functions
<tsaber>	tomty89: what about it? steam wants version 28
<grawity>	yumbox: but that's assuming a fast interpreter and fast hash implementation
<ryanvade>	holomorph: what do you mean
<ryanvade>	sheep: the cmake flags
<sheep>	ryanvade: if that works, it's fine
<tomty89>	tsaber: get/make a package of the older branch
<ryanvade>	sheep: i honestly can't tell

<earnestly>	  u 1 2 3 3 3 4 5 2
<earnestly>	1 2 3 4 5
<ryanvade>	holomorph: yeah mine is based off of that.  with opencv 3 and the contrib as well.  i am just trying to make this for a project
<earnestly>	 u 1 8 1 2 7 2 8 3 9 2 1
<earnestly>	1 8 2 7 3 9
<earnestly>	also stable
<c0de1>	is anyone else here getting the "key repeat stops working" bug?
<c0de1>	on gnome
<earnestly>	grawity: i think it's doing basically the same thing as perl
<ryanvade>	c0de1: no
<c0de1>	hm
<tsaber>	tomty89: ok i downloaded the older version, how do i do it?
<tsaber>	tar.xz
<tomty89>	tsaber: i meant arch package, so either aur or write one; but maybe you can just built it and put the so to /usr/lib *shrug*
<tsaber>	tomty89: can't i symlink .28 to .30 ?
<tomty89>	!give tsaber tias
<phrik>	tsaber: try it and see™
<tsaber>	ok
<scimmia>	tsaber, no, don't do that
<scimmia>	the soname changes for a reason
<dynamicmetaflow>	greetings everyone, i'm running arch and using kde plasma 5. i installed dropbox but there is no system tray, is there any way i access the preferences menu of dropbox through a terminal?
<grawity>	nope, install something like stalonetray
<earnestly>	grawity: [] list, * = first, ' = each, = = equals.  1 2 3 = 1 2 4 \returns 1 1 0
<dynamicmetaflow>	ok will give that a try
<grawity>	though some things are available via cli, like `dropbox exclude` or `dropbox lansync`
<grawity>	i think that's in a separate package?
<dynamicmetaflow>	yeah i saw the cli
<earnestly>	not quite sure what : does
<dynamicmetaflow>	i was considering that as well but didn't mess with it just yet
<holomorph>	earnestly: sometimes : means "such that"
<grawity>	the developers have been informed of the tray issue, but i don't know what plans they have
<earnestly>	holomorph: apparently it means a few things
<tsaber>	scimmia: lib32-gnutls-3.3.13-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz ... failed (the public key cfa6af15e5c74149fc1d8c086d1655c14ce1c13e is not trusted)
<earnestly>	holomorph: dictionary
<earnestly>	holomorph: so it is basically doing hashing as we thought
<holomorph>	ah
<earnestly>	holomorph: d[`symbol]:1 2 3
<dynamicmetaflow>	yeah read about it in the forums, hopefully it will be addressed. at some point i want to back to owncloud
<earnestly>	holomorph: d[`symbol] \returns 1 2 3
<scimmia>	tsaber, where did that package come from?

<tomty89>	oops aur
<tomty89>	nvm then
<tomty89>	eh but...
<earnestly>	grawity: does gedit really have that technical paper background these days?
<earnestly>	grawity: like http://hergert.me/blog/2015/04/22/minimap.png
<tomty89>	tsaber: "lib32-gnutls-3.3.13-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz ... failed (the public key cfa6af15e5c74149fc1d8c086d1655c14ce1c13e is not trusted)" that's repo i think
<grawity>	earnestly: haven't checked, i'm pretty sure it's optional as the screenshot shows though.
<grawity>	earnestly: hmm, yeah, now i remember it in git log
<earnestly>	oh sure

<earnestly>	but it's slightly interesting.  it doesn't look bad
<grawity>	tbh, i think it's fine, pure white is bad on eyes anyway
<ryanvade>	tomty89: the advcp package in the aur also has that issue
<holomorph>	earnestly: maybe it's a plugin
<earnestly>	grawity: yeah, i don't disagree
<grawity>	hmm, haven't built gedit-git in a while
<earnestly>	grawity: https://blogs.gnome.org/nacho/files/2015/05/minimap.png the fonts d:
<scimmia>	er, tsaber ^
<earnestly>	are so badly rendered
<tomty89>	oh the makepkg thing, but that doesn't seem to be the problem he pasted :p
<tsaber>	tomty89, scimmia: gpg --lsign
<grawity>	let's see if it still has that scroll glitch in theme selection box
<tsaber>	tomty89, scimmia: thanks
<grawity>	earnestly: they're making the screenshots on stock fedora
<earnestly>	i still get a giggle over 'gint'
<earnestly>	grawity: yeah, stock fedora is pretty nasty
<grawity>	i think they at least deprecated gsize over size_t
<cloudef>	i've never understood what good is minimap for
<earnestly>	cloudef: it's basically acme scrollbars with more texture
<cloudef>	also that gedit screenost: my eyes ;_;
<cloudef>	s/screenost/screenshot/
<earnestly>	cloudef: it can be configured to look nice, don't worry.  the screenshot is just badness
<earnestly>	grawity: i don't understand why they use gint or gfoo just to shadow standard types.  i do understand and think it's nice when people give it actual information like msg_t, as seen in the sel4 kernel
<grawity>	earnestly: well, at least for gchar, i think it was to ensure that it has the same signedness absolutely everywhere
<holomorph>	lol gedit just crashed

<cloudef>	vodik: apart from basic auth, not really
<earnestly>	typedef uint32_t bool_t;  that's odd

<tsaber>	tomty89, scimmia: gpg: no default secret key: no secret key
<tsaber>	key not changed so no update needed.
<cloudef>	vodik: well the server does not execute code, only clients
<tsaber>	when i gpg lsign <key>
<scimmia>	tsaber, did you download the key first?
<grawity>	wait, for aur?
<holomorph>	gedit doesn't know how to display form feed…
<grawity>	you don't usually need to --lsign keys for aur
<scimmia>	grawity, there is no validpgpkeys array in this case, so he does
<vodik>	cloudef: wait, i must have misunderstood. i've only ever run it on one machine. so if i run the client its building where the client is run and posting the results?
<grawity>	ah, yes
<scimmia>	i already left a comment on the aur page
<grawity>	add a validpgpkeys then, i would say...
<grawity>	or --skipinteg >_>
<cloudef>	vodik: yes, server only takes results and shows them
<tsaber>	scimmia: i tried recv-key but they are already in the keyring, just not trusted. when i gpg -lsign <key> they are even listed only afterwards it says no restart needed since no key has been changed
<earnestly>	cloudef: you could use playpen
<cloudef>	vodik: there was someone who for example only used the client and skipped server all together
<cloudef>	he posted results to xmpp
<earnestly>	vodik: ^
<vodik>	ah
<vodik>	earnestly: yeah
<cloudef>	the server does not communicate back or anything either. it's totally oblivious of the clients
<vodik>	cloudef: okay, i have no problme with this, that's actually a good solution
<scimmia>	tsaber, it seems to be telling you that you need to create your own key before you can sign another key with it
<tsaber>	scimmia: oh ok
<earnestly>	vodik: in a way, that also means you get more control over the build machines since they'd like be yours
<vodik>	yeah
<vodik>	so i'm cool with that
<tsaber>	scimmia: thanks for your help. i think i'll just accept having no steam store until the issue is resolved by steam or gnutls
<cloudef>	it also means, you can replace the client part for your own. the server just takes json specified in readme.md :p
<cloudef>	or run it inside sandbox too
<vodik>	dependancies and so forth, yeah
<earnestly>	lovely
<scimmia>	tsaber, you can always use --skipinteg or add a validpgpkeys array, like grawity suggested
<tsaber>	scimmia: thanks
<tsaber>	grawity: thanks
<tsaber>	i'll look into it
<vodik>	cloudef: cool, well thats nifty. k. i almost got some basic yaml recipe stuff done, then i want to try and add a raw cmdline and make/scan-build modules
<vodik>	and if buhman nails the git integration, this would be perfect
<cloudef>	vodik: yes, i welcome all of those :p
<vodik>	cloudef: i want phabricator/arc features on github :d

<phrik>	yentity test passed
<yentity>	very cool.
<ryanvade>	cmake is unable to find tbb even though i have intel-tbb installed. anyone know of a fix?
<grawity>	earnestly: so yeah, gedit has that background already, as well as the clang stuff
<earnestly>	ryanvade: where is cmake looking?
<ryanvade>	earnestly: it should be looking in the default locations. i have not changed the path for it
<earnestly>	ryanvade: and what is "the default locations"?
<earnestly>	cmake has logs
<earnestly>	does cmake even come with a findtbb by default?

<earnestly>	ryanvade: then where is it looking
<grawity>	dob1: i think the instructions also mention `pacman-key --lsign`
<jasabella>	i realise that archlinux is aimed to minimise interfering with you making your system your own, but is there like a checklist somewhere of things i should have installed? like list of hardware things (if this makes sense)

<dob1>	grawity, seem the first one
<ryanvade>	....of course not. :(
<polyzen>	your mom's a camel
<meskarune>	it says it can't mount /dev/ndb0
<logol>	ryanvade: sourcing site-paclages/powerline/bindings/bash/powerline.sh gives me errors mainly in usr/bin/powerline-render: attributeerror: 'list' object has no attribute 'startswith' - do you have any idea what this could be? both machines have the same packages/architecture and configs
<grawity>	dob1: did it succeed previously?
<meskarune>	socket failed connection refused
<hyo0301>	polyzen: just wondering how i can search for aur packages instead of downloading them throughh the website ^
<dob1>	grawity, no
<polyzen>	hyo0301, cower
<dob1>	hyo0301, cower -s
<ryanvade>	logol i'm not the one to ask about that. i don't use it

<dob1>	ops gpg: connecting dirmngr at '/root/.gnupg/s.dirmngr' failed: ipc connect call failed
<polyzen>	and i heard pacaur is a better option than yaourt
<grawity>	m(
<logol>	ryanvade: oh okay sry
<polyzen>	u wot m(
<grawity>	so gnupg is being stupid again
<ryanvade>	logol no worries :)
<keenerd>	playing with plasma, ran into some minor theme weirdness.  the cursor theme uses the default x theme when on the desktop.  (uses the fancy theme in applications.)  any idea what is going on?
<cloudef>	ryanvade: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/intel-tbb-pc/
<phrik>	title: aur (en) - intel-tbb-pc (at aur.archlinux.org)
<cloudef>	ryanvade: technically if upstream tbb does not provide .pc, this is bug in opencv build system
<ryanvade>	cloudef: i'll try it
<dob1>	grawity, i remember i run into this problem for another repository/package, but i don't remember the solution :)
<holomorph>	grawity: what's it doing? ._.
<grawity>	tbh, i'm not sure
<ryanvade>	cloudef: i have run into so many issues with opencv build system. ill add that to the bug report
<grawity>	if it's pacman-key, it's not supposed to use /root/.gnupg at all
<ryanvade>	cloudef: it found tbb.  thank you
<dob1>	ok but it's a my system problem or a known one?
<grawity>	earnestly: $weechat_home
<ryanvade>	cloudef: i can't get cmake to enable building of opencv_contrib in the pkgbuild.  i have to manually edit it.  how can i fix that?
<cpnl>	ow
<tomty89>	eh
<earnestly>	grawity: :o
<tom^>	grawity: wat
<tom^>	you mean i dont need to build my own weechat with -dweechat_home=~/.config/weechat ?
<c0de1>	hi
<earnestly>	tom^: https://github.com/weechat/weechat/commit/1eaf0e36e825d5aff394d0e1489b3b813cf144e4
<phrik>	title: core: respect environment variable weechat_home · weechat/weechat@1eaf0e3 · github (at github.com)
<cloudef>	ryanvade: the install docs just say to use -dopencv_extra_modules_path to point to contrib modules
<earnestly>	grawity: i wonder why he's doing ~ expansion instead of letting the shell
<earnestly>	grawity: i guess if people use non-shells to supply arguments or something
<cloudef>	ryanvade: your pkgbuild looks weird though, it has space there
<earnestly>	like config files
<tom^>	earnestly: finally.
<grawity>	earnestly: maybe – it's useful for .pam_environment, for example
<ryanvade>	cloudef: thats what i am doing now. it still disables it. even when building manually cmake does not enable it.
<earnestly>	grawity: yeah... but pam_env is whacky anyway
<cloudef>	ryanvade: it's probably invalid path
<ryanvade>	yeah, the pkgbuild is hacked together from others
<th0rne>	how to add community-staging repo to my repos?
<th0rne>	if that makes sense.
<earnestly>	th0rne: you... don't?
<grawity>	th0rne: 1) aks yourself "why the hell would you"
<cloudef>	ryanvade: you should ask opencv people though for that
<th0rne>	darktable doesn't work.
<grawity>	th0rne: 2) if you decide to do it anyway, then add it with the regular arch mirrors
<th0rne>	here, look: https://www.archlinux.org/todo/openexr-220-ilmbase-220-so-bump/
<phrik>	title: arch linux - todo: openexr 2.2.0 / ilmbase 2.20 so bump (at www.archlinux.org)
<grawity>	yes, what exactly am i supposed to look at
<th0rne>	well, if i'm reading this right, the staging version of darktable works?
<grawity>	it seems so
<th0rne>	so could i get it somehow?
<earnestly>	wait
<earnestly>	honestly
<grawity>	yes, like i said, regular pacman.conf repo, regular arch mirrors
<grawity>	it is odd though that openexr itself did not go through [staging]
<th0rne>	i need to darktable some photos for my mother for mother's day, it's urgent. i can't wait until they fix it.
<earnestly>	th0rne: staging is where packages just get rebuilt, it's not intended for use
<earnestly>	hm
<th0rne>	:/
<earnestly>	:\
<th0rne>	there must be a way!
<earnestly>	oh well, as grawity said
<qubitnerd>	th0rne: earnestly your smiles are kinda similar
<th0rne>	ok. :)
<holomorph>	add the repo, grab it, remove repo :p
<tomty89>	:x
<earnestly>	well, deal with the fallout later
<th0rne>	how bad is it going to be?
<qubitnerd>	tell her you ruined your arch for it
<th0rne>	can i just grab this single package?
<th0rne>	lol
<holomorph>	of course
<qubitnerd>	thats how much you love her
<th0rne>	:d
<tomty89>	or change your timezone
<th0rne>	is it really that bad? what's the fallout going to be like?
<th0rne>	*fallout
<tomty89>	in bethesda's hand
<namarrgon>	fallout 4 confirmed?
<tom^>	its going to happen in vegas
<tom^>	or did it already?
<th0rne>	is it possible to just download the one package from the repo?
<grawity>	yes, pacman -u it
<th0rne>	will that still cause me problems?
<grawity>	alternatively, http://sprunge.us/tjyq
<grawity>	with that, you can `pacman -s staging/foo`
<th0rne>	oh, cool!
<hyo0301>	shutdown, reboot, logout
<yoosi>	the aur shows that yaourt is out of date. should i be concerned? (first time user)
<hyo0301>	what's lock/switch user command?
<ryanvade>	yoosi no
<dob1>	sorry if i insist, but what i have to do to use repo-ck repository?   i am not able to import the key of this repository
<cirrus_minor>	yoosi ➤    familiarise yourself with using cower for aur
<yoosi>	thanks you ryanvade and cirrus_minor. looking into cower now
<yumbox>	hyo0301: depends on your de. if you don't have a de, you can use control+alt+f1-12 to switch tty's.
<th0rne>	grawity: after i add that to conf, i do what before -s? right now it can't find.
<th0rne>	-su?
<tomty89>	yumbox: dm
<tsteinholz>	tst
<cirrus_minor>	yoosi http://cirrus.turtil.net/cowertut.webm
<tsteinholz>	oh hello everyone
<yumbox>	tomty89: well, it could be de or wm. don't think i've heard of dm?
<tsteinholz>	does someone know where xinitrc is located. its not in the root dir.
<hyo0301>	yumbox: i mean in the command line...
<tomty89>	yumbox: how can you switch user if you use startx for gnome
<cirrus_minor>	tsteinholz ➤    in ~
<yoosi>	cirrus_minor: 37.9mb... wow
<yumbox>	tomty89: via the gui of the de usually.
<_chunk>	does anyone know why krunner would stop working?
<cirrus_minor>	yoosi ➤    hmm if your browser had relevant pluging youd be able to just view in browser
<tomty89>	!bail
<phrik>	looks like tomty89 is bailing out on this one - good luck!
<yumbox>	tomty89: ?
<grawity>	yumbox: the de depends on gdm for this feature though
<cirrus_minor>	if firefox its gecko-medialplayer
<tomty89>	!give yumbox tias
<phrik>	yumbox: try it and see™
<yoosi>	cirrus_minor: do you have a reccomendation for ff or chromium?
<yumbox>	grawity: yeah, you're right.
<yumbox>	tomty89: ?
<th0rne>	grawity: i get: error: config file /etc/pacman.d/pkgbuild could not be read: no such file or directory
<grawity>	th0rne: remove those lines
<th0rne>	ok.
<cirrus_minor>	hold on yoosi  net is slooww today
<ryanvade>	cloudef: yeah  opencv is just not setup verywell at the moment. doesen
<yumbox>	hyo0301: what de/wm are you using? (for example, gnome or kde)
<ryanvade>	't even build at the moement
<hyo0301>	yumbox: no de, i3 wm
<tomty89>	lol i3lock
<tomty89>	you can use a dm for it though
<hyo0301>	oh wow
<hyo0301>	didn't even know
<cirrus_minor>	yoosi ➤    for firefox https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/gecko-mediaplayer/
<phrik>	title: arch linux - gecko-mediaplayer 1.0.9-1 (x86_64) (at www.archlinux.org)
<yumbox>	to lock you can use i3lock. to logout you can use mod+shift+e
<cirrus_minor>	yoosi ➤    ^ is x86_64
<yumbox>	hyo0301: you can also use i3exit
<yumbox>	hyo0301: for example: i3exit logout
<hyo0301>	mod+shift+e = exit
<hyo0301>	oh
<hyo0301>	i just want to go to the lightdm lock screen
<yumbox>	logout is the same as exit
<hyo0301>	without turning off all my apps
<hyo0301>	like locking
<yumbox>	i don't know how to do that with lightdm.
<yumbox>	i think i3exit lock will use i3lock.
<hyo0301>	yea it does
<yumbox>	(instead of lightdm lock)
<hyo0301>	i3lock look cool tho
<tomty89>	!wtf i3exit
<phrik>	tomty89: what the hell is i3exit?
<tomty89>	hmm
<yumbox>	tomty89: it's a command included with i3wm
<th0rne>	any ideas? http://ix.io/it9
<tomty89>	yumbox: which i don't see *shrug*
<yoosi>	thank you cirrus_minor. that needs cower before able to install cower viewer irony
<cirrus_minor>	no yoosi
<yumbox>	tomty89: hmm, maybe you're right. wait.
<cirrus_minor>	download the cower tarball from aur page, extract it, cd in and makepkg -sic
<tomty89>	th0rne: you might need to -rdd lua if you insist on the staging way
<th0rne>	well, i'm not sure if i insist on it. i still don't know how bad of an idea it is. :)
<yumbox>	tomty89: i3exit is actually a custom shell script that i downloaded. it's not included in the arch package.
<yumbox>	i was wrong :/
<tomty89>	heh
<cirrus_minor>	yoosi ➤    gecko-mediaplayer is installed with pacman -s btw
<tomty89>	i wonder if "toggling" tty if the only / a possible way to make a dm lock the session of a wm
<th0rne>	let's say i don't go the staging way. can i just fix this by downgrading? darktable: error while loading shared libraries: libilmimf-imf_2_1.so.21: cannot open shared object file
<th0rne>	downgrading the lib i mean.
<yumbox>	hyo0301: it seems 'i3-msg exit' is the command to exit i3 via cli.
<tomty89>	th0rne: doesn't hurt to try
<th0rne>	ok, i'll do that. :)
<tsteinholz>	i3 is weird to me
<tomty89>	celeron is weird to me
<tomty89>	(do intel still use the name celeron?)
<tomty89>	!w intel celeron
<phrik>	tomty89: celeron - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/celeron>
<tomty89>	hmm seems yes
<egasimus>	hey folks, just replaced my laptop with an identical one (acer v3-371), restored my fsarchiver backup, and now i realize xrandr doesn't detect my hdmi port
<egasimus>	(which used to work just fine on the previous machine -- which i replaced due to mechanical defects)
<hyo0301>	how to open close cli after executing a software?
<egasimus>	is there anything i could check on the software side or is this a hardware fault
<hyo0301>	close*
<microcolonel>	has anyone else here been having trouble starting up weston recently?
<microcolonel>	weston-launch fails to set up egl on my machine, and has for a couple of months on arch
<microcolonel>	but it somewhat hilariously shows says that "egl_success" is the error code it got
<microcolonel>	which would seem to me like egl is working fine
<earnestly>	demize: which rfc syntax was that you used?
<microcolonel>	weston does however work with the pixman backend
<demize>	earnestly: https://github.com/miekg/rfc
<phrik>	title: miekg/rfc · github (at github.com)
<microcolonel>	ohh, it's on the wiki now
<earnestly>	demize: thanks, better than the syntax-rfc vimscripts thing
<earnestly>	demize: i should adapt it
<microcolonel>	the solution on the wiki doesn't work either :(
<hyo0301>	all my sound got muted wtf
<sarkis>	hey all did the archlinux beginners guide have syslinux and gpt at one point?
<sarkis>	seems like taht info is missing - wondering if grub is the way to go now
<tomty89>	!wiki syslinu
<phrik>	tomty89: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/syslinux
<sarkis>	i guess the question is - is gpt worth the trouble?
<thrice>	what trouble?
<tomty89>	!wiki gpt
<phrik>	tomty89: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/guid_partition_table
<demize>	earnestly: yeah. for one modifying the headers so that they are highlighted would be nice
<tomty89>	egasimus: maybe a quick look on dmesg / xorg log
<random-nick>	if i install firefox-nightly from the aur, does it conflict with the repo firefox?
<namarrgon>	what does the pkgbuild say?
<pablotron>	linux users are like jesus, they turn windows into wine
<egasimus>	tomty89: what am i looking for?
<tomty89>	egasimus: error or anything about hdmi at all?
<c0de1>	anyone know how to stop gnome3 shell from turning the screen off when locking ?
<hyo0301>	how to install all deps for a file
<hyo0301>	wine has like 122 deps, i'm missing 40 of them
<random-nick>	namarrgon: i can't find the conflict variable in the pkgbuild?

<phrik>	title: gdm - how can i enable screenlock without turning off the monitor? (ubuntu gnome 14.04) - ask ubuntu (at askubuntu.com)
<muflone>	hyo0301: enable multilib repository
<namarrgon>	random-nick: then it, most likely, doesn't conflict
<hyo0301>	muflone: it'
<egasimus>	tomty89: nothing pops out i'm afraid
<hyo0301>	muflone: it's enabled, but it doesn't work for some reason
<muflone>	hyo0301: tell us a missing dependency
<egasimus>	tomty89: looks like it picks up the reprobeoutputs setting i put in xorg.conf
<egasimus>	tomty89: but it only detects edp1 and virtual1
<tomty89>	egasimus: paste your xorg conf and log maybe
<egasimus>	tomty89: i don't remember seeing the latter before, and i've never enabled a virtual display
<egasimus>	tomty89: sure, just a sec
<sarkis>	so i have a server sitting around at home - want to use it to run multiple vms - you guys think vagrant+libvirt is a good route?
<sarkis>	should i go kvm?
<sarkis>	archlinux will be the host
<sarkis>	the guest vms will all be linux and don't need gui
<hyo0301>	muflone: warning, database 'multilib' doesn't exist?
<muflone>	hyo0301: update your repositories list with pacman -sy first
<hyo0301>	muflone: it's fixed! thanks
<tomty89>	hyo0301: did you mean optdep? or have you been installing deps explicitly for all packages :s
<muflone>	ok hyo0301
<sarkis>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/vagrant#vagrant-libvirt
<phrik>	title: vagrant - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<sarkis>	looks promising
<hyo0301>	tomty89: i don't know, i always download tarball from aur, then makepkg, if deps are missing, i manually install them the same way
<tomty89>	hyo0301: makepkg -(r)s

<egasimus>	tomty89: which would mean that if there's an issue then it probably isn't on the xorg side of things
<david89>	tomty89: i only read egasimus last two messages, are you having issued with multimonitor and gdm?
<tomty89>	egasimus: if it's a software thing probably the kernel
<jasabella>	david89... i'm running plasma5 without the kdeapps, seems to be ok
<tomty89>	david89: no
<egasimus>	tomty89: no gdm, i'm using lxdm
<egasimus>	tomty89: but yeah, it could fall under multimonitor issues
<tomty89>	egasimus: maybe you can try linux-lts
<tomty89>	see if it's a new kernel bug
<houn>	stupid question time: in the past, to set up ssh access to an arch install all i've had to do is install openssh and start up sshd.  it's enabled and started, but my user account cannot log in; just get access denied.  password auth.  am i missing a step?  do allowed users have to be manually specified now?
<egasimus>	tomty89: i guess i could; though it worked on my previous machine with an up-to-date kernel
<tomty89>	by up-to-date you mean 4.0.1?
<egasimus>	tomty89: but i did reinstall the kernel when restoring the backup (boot partition wasn't backed up_
<egasimus>	tomty89: i guess, yeah
<houn>	wait; i think i figured it out.
<namarrgon>	houn: no, it works out of the box. have you edited the ssh config in any way?
<egasimus>	tomty89: it could've updated from 4.0.0 to 4.0.1 during that
<egasimus>	tomty89: or something
<tomty89>	hmm
<houn>	namarrgon: argh, i think my router isn't forwarding the connection.
<sarkis>	so parted looks like it allows you to allocate the entire drive
<houn>	not arch's fault
<houn>	houn dumb
<sarkis>	so for example a 250gb hd only has like 221.x free no?
<sarkis>	221 gb or so
<tomty89>	gb/gib
<sarkis>	oh right
<houn>	ha ha!  yeah, that was on me.

<namarrgon>	poeticallyevil: don't edit units in /usr, they will be overwritten on the next update. add it to fstab if you must.
<poeticallyevil>	atamisk: did you pacman -syu  ? note the "y"
<sudokode>	!manjaro3 is <reply>https://i.imgur.com/qv7qrqb.png
<phrik>	sudokode: tada!
<atamisk>	david89: like a week ago
<david89>	atamisk: follow poeticallyevil
<atamisk>	poeticallyevil: yes. it's failing to download the package lists
<pid1>	!manjaro3

<pid1>	=d
<pid1>	i'm so happy
<poeticallyevil>	atamisk: can you paste the command and output ?
<tomty89>	i think that screenshot should be posted on every sites about linux distro
<tomty89>	*distros
<pid1>	^agreed.
<david89>	they should replace their cert with it, it has the same security features
<sudokode>	haha
<sudokode>	who's a reddit person?
<sudokode>	i'd post it but i hate reddit
<pid1>	i posted it a while ago when it happened.
<sudokode>	heh yeah it is a little old for reddit
<pid1>	https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxactionshow/comments/31x5ba/expired_ssl_certificate_manjaros_solution_change/
<pid1>	it was up on top of /r/linux for a while as well.
<sudokode>	lol to las too
<sudokode>	nice
<pid1>	=)
<tomty89>	pid1: omg read the last comment
<tomty89>	maybe they're waiting for the archlinux devs to solve this too. :/
<pid1>	but of course they are
<poeticallyevil>	namarrgon: i'm fine with systemd mounting it. should i copy the file to /etc/tmpfiles.d ?
<namarrgon>	poeticallyevil: what?
<atamisk>	http://ix.io/ita
<namarrgon>	poeticallyevil: add it to /etc/fstab
<atamisk>	poeticallyevil: see above
<logol>	hey.. is there a table/list of keysequences to determine the correct keys for some macros in /etc/inputrc e.g. which key "\e[11~" is or "\e[5c" ?
<atamisk>	capsfail
<sudokode>	or copy it to /etc/systemd/system/
<sudokode>	modify it there at least
<poeticallyevil>	namarrgon: won't that circumvent the tmp.mount of systemd ?
<namarrgon>	poeticallyevil: yes it will
<tomty89>	pid1: was that a joke?
<pid1>	hmmm. eclipse still defaults to jdk7. shouldn't that be jdk 8 now?
<sudokode>	8 is fairly new
<sudokode>	probably still being tested in jdk 8
<namarrgon>	poeticallyevil: systemd will just generate a unit for it, it's pretty much the same thing
<sudokode>	since eclipse is java, no?
<pid1>	tomty89 yes, sorry. didn't include a /s there
<tomty89>	lol anyway
<fungle>	logol: i'm think that has handled by your terminal/x
<sudokode>	!g terminal escape sequences
<phrik>	sudokode: ansi escape code - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ansi_escape_code>
<egasimus>	(can i speak?)
<sudokode>	no
<tomty89>	sigh arch was framed
<sudokode>	you have to earn that right here
<egasimus>	hmm, i think i got banned before i could set my nickname
<tomty89>	egasimus: you can type
<egasimus>	(cuz i can't even weechat)
<sudokode>	egasimus: gotta be registered to talk in here
<egasimus>	so that's why i'm asking :d
<sudokode>	i think that's still set anyway
<sudokode>	somewhere in chanserv
<thelemonman>	when did weechat become a verb ?
<egasimus>	sudokode: yeah, got something like "can't change nickname while banned on channel"
<sudokode>	thelemonman: since i started weechatting
<tomty89>	everything can be verb
<sudokode>	egasimus: yeah it's a confusing message
<tomty89>	like, we arch
<sudokode>	if you can't talk in a channel, you also can't change nicks
<egasimus>	thelemonman: when did "i can't even" became a... hmm, whatchacallit, in bulgarian it's phraseologism
<sudokode>	to prevent spam from banned people
<egasimus>	sudokode: makes sense
<poeticallyevil>	atamisk: hum... i'm not sure. i can download the core.db fine through firefox... (http://lug.mtu.edu/archlinux/core/os/x86_64/core.db). can you paste your /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
<egasimus>	tomty89: so as i was booting into linux-pf i plugged the monitor back in, and xfce detected it
<tomty89>	egasimus: and also xrandr?
<egasimus>	tomty89: now i'm back into 4.0.1 and it works all fine. i guess the option in xorg.conf just took another reboot
<tomty89>	d:
<egasimus>	tomty89: yep, also xrandr :)
<atamisk>	\i can to...
<sudokode>	poeticallyevil: what's going on?
<tomty89>	egasimus: xorg option won't require a reboot
<egasimus>	tomty89: makes sense when you think of it -- since you're configuring a kernel driver through xorg.conf...
<darkelement>	 hey guys how can i access the guest os with my archlinux vm? i am trying to download vmware tools for it.
<tomty89>	egasimus: that option shouldn't even be used normally according to the man page
<atamisk>	http://ix.io/itb
<pid1>	atamisk ....
<poeticallyevil>	sudokode: what do you mean ?
<pid1>	maybe uncomment a server or two?
<sudokode>	darkelement: community/open-vm-tools
<sudokode>	install that in the guest
<sudokode>	check the wiki for more info
<darkelement>	ok, thanks!
<sudokode>	poeticallyevil: as in.. what's going on?
<atamisk>	pid1: ?
<sudokode>	what is this issue you're having with pacman?
<sudokode>	and have you posted the proper log info
<poeticallyevil>	sudokode: oh, it's not me, i'm trying to assit atamisk here.
<darkelement>	sudokode: but how do i install it in the guest?
<sudokode>	oh
<egasimus>	tomty89: yep, the whole setup sounds just sketchy enough to take not one but two reboots before it works :d
<sudokode>	!give atamisk sprungepacman
<phrik>	atamisk: lc_all=c pacman --debug <pacmanoptions> |& tee >(curl -f sprunge=@- sprunge.us)
<pid1>	atamisk, all of your servers are commented.
<atamisk>	all but 2
<tomty89>	egasimus: the xorg conf won't be read until you start x, and after a reboot whatever "configure" should have been reset
<sudokode>	replace <pacmanoptions> with -syu
<tomty89>	egasimus: but well no idea about what happend
<poeticallyevil>	atamisk: repo urls should look like this : http://delta.archlinux.fr/$repo/os/$arch
<pid1>	atamask, they should be
<pid1>	server = http://lug.mtu.edu/archlinux/$repo/os/$arch
<pid1>	not
<pid1>	server = http://lug.mtu.edu/archlinux//os/
<atamisk>	that's ...odd
<atamisk>	even my pacnew is like that
<atamisk>	that i haven't done anything to but merge
<poeticallyevil>	atamisk: did you use rankmirrors ?
<atamisk>	i did after my initial issue
<atamisk>	wait
<atamisk>	no i used the web utility
<sudokode>	http://sprunge.us/frie
<sudokode>	don't use that
<sudokode>	use reflector
<fungle>	+1 for reflector
<fungle>	but you gotta have python though
<darkelement>	sudokode: the problem i am having is how to install it in the "guest"
<tomty89>	python <3
<darkelement>	or even accessing the "guest", at all.
<egasimus>	tomty89: well as far as i understood the manpage it sets up the available ports early during kernel boot but only reprobes afterwards during xorg startup
<sudokode>	darkelement: boot it up via vmware
<sudokode>	how else would you access it?
<egasimus>	tomty89: or whatever :d
<egasimus>	and now onto loftier pursuits
<darkelement>	sudokode: yea, i just don't see the option for guest where it is shown to be
<sudokode>	darkelement: screenshot of vmware
<tomty89>	egasimus: i think what it does it to reprobe your monitors, like read the edid again or so
<darkelement>	sure, one sec.
<sudokode>	more familiar with vbox
<tomty89>	egasimus: you ports should always be available
<darkelement>	sudokode: http://pasteboard.co/meqzaaf.png
<phrik>	title: pasteboard — uploaded image (at pasteboard.co)
<poeticallyevil>	namarrgon: sudokode is there any difference between putting a line in /etc/fstab and letting systemd generate a unit for it, and modify /usr/lib/systemd/system/tmp.mount by putting in it  /etc/systemd/system/ ?
<egasimus>	tomty89: yes, but that's info that is initially needed earlier (console startup) than the reprobe can happen (during xorg startup), hence the reboots
<egasimus>	tomty89: i had no hdmi1 at all in xrandr
<sudokode>	poeticallyevil: yeah there's your... wait wtf
<sudokode>	lol tiny x
<sudokode>	but yeah, that's i3 with a terminal... just type in there
<egasimus>	tomty89: so maybe it's more involved than just reading the edids
<sudokode>	or dwm
<sudokode>	whatever it is
<namarrgon>	poeticallyevil: like i said, don't edit shit in /usr, it will be overwritten on updates.
<namarrgon>	poeticallyevil: apart from that, no but imho keeping the mounts in one place is simpler
<darkelement>	sudokode: perhaps i am already logged into the guest operating system, and i'm just an idiot.
<sudokode>	poeticallyevil: /etc/systemd/ is for system-level unit changes
<sudokode>	darkelement: it appears to be booted up and running x
<tomty89>	egasimus: that's not making any sense
<sudokode>	you're just seeing a tiny window cause you're missing the vmware video driver
<egasimus>	tomty89: it makes sense to me :d
<sudokode>	which is somewhere in the open-vm stuff
<tomty89>	egasimus: i'd rather say it's some random detection/hardware failure
<sudokode>	!wiki vmware
<phrik>	sudokode: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/vmware
<darkelement>	sudokode: yea, im trying to install vmware tools right now
<sudokode>	that will know more about it than me
<darkelement>	yea, alright
<egasimus>	tomty89: look what it says in man intel
<atamisk>	ugh, reflector fixed it
<atamisk>	thanks guys.
<atamisk>	i don't know what happened to my mirrorlist from before.
<sarkis>	does it matter where the /boot partition is?
<egasimus>	tomty89: "as the kernel driver loads it scans for connected displays and configures a console spanning these outputs"
<sarkis>	does it have to be the first oe?
<sarkis>	one?
<sudokode>	sarkis: nope
<sarkis>	nice ty
<tomty89>	egasimus: that doesn't prevent the port from appearing even if no monitor is connected when boot
<egasimus>	tomty89: hmm, yeah
<sudokode>	partition position is completely arbitrary these days... unless windows
<tomty89>	egasimus: at most the monitor won't be correctly modesetted after plug
<egasimus>	tomty89: but the monitor was connected the whole time (before i plugged it out to test with another laptop)
<tomty89>	well it doesn't matter anyway, as i said
<egasimus>	tomty89: yep :) i'm glad i won't be returning this laptop...
<egasimus>	yet
<tomty89>	i'm not sure if there's some "stateful" register thing on the hardware that require the kernel driver to properly initialized it once though
<sml>	hi
<sudokode>	stateful register?
<egasimus>	tomty89: i was thinking along the same lines
<sudokode>	you mean secondary storage? :p
<tomty89>	no idea, i always heard intel devs talking about some secret register :p
<sudokode>	hm
<sudokode>	never heard of that
<sudokode>	most compilers just ignore register operations anyway
<sudokode>	that's all left to the hardware afaik
<tomty89>	maybe i have been fantasizing too much
<sudokode>	!shrug2
<phrik>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<poeticallyevil>	sarkis: just curious, why do you have a separate /boot partition ?
<sudokode>	hopefully for a good reason
<tomty89>	requirement of gummiboot+uefi heh
<tomty89>	!grub
<phrik>	grand unified bootloader https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/grub2
<egasimus>	 wouldn't a separate boot partition (esp. in beginning of spinning media) speed up boots?
<jasabella>	grub grub
<sudokode>	no
<sudokode>	the esp is recognized in the gpt
<sudokode>	so its position is known, seeking is minimal time
<jasabella>	wonder if i should try grub out
<sudokode>	in other words, you won't notice the speedup on a spinning disk :p
<tomty89>	sudokode: sounds like you're talking about separate /boot from esp
<egasimus>	sudokode: is it the same on a mbr/dos partition tables?
<egasimus>	*table
<sudokode>	egasimus: there's a boot flag for mbr
<sudokode>	for uefi, there's partition type, ef00
<tomty89>	i thought egasimus is talking about separate /boot in general?
<sudokode>	cause you can have multiple esps on one drive
<tomty89>	sudokode: is that really allowed in spec?
<sudokode>	tomty89: huh?
<sudokode>	yeah, you should have a separate esp for each os
<sudokode>	and you can have multiple ones on a single drive
<tomty89>	ehh
<tomty89>	i always thought it's at least recommended to have one esp per drive
<sudokode>	you only need it on the drives you're booting from
<sudokode>	you can use just one for multiple oses, but why bother?
<junka>	um i dont really get whats the ideal value for 'advanced power management level' 254 or 128?
<tomty89>	aren't multiple esps more "bothering"
<tomty89>	after all it's only the place for efi binaries
<dagle>	oh right.
<tomty89>	*the place only for
<dagle>	i promised to do a digest on the kernelbug.
<dagle>	fuck.
<saivert>	you mostly just have one firmware boot entry (nvram) that loads one bootloader anyways. don't know what multiple esps would solve here
<sudokode>	tomty89: same reason you'd have multiple /boot partitions
<sudokode>	so each os doesn't try messing with the files of another
<tomty89>	i think that's kind of different, how often would it conflict unless the fallback is used
<tomty89>	but well if you boot the kernel efistub directly
<saivert>	i just don't see how that would be useful
<sudokode>	tomty89: two different os's installing gummiboot to /boot/efi/gummiboot/
<score_under>	i'm a little annoyed at per-application volume control (i never use it, and sometimes/rarely applications will set themselves to 100%, about 3-4 times the master volume, just to fuck with me), is this a good enough reason to disable pulse? on my currently single-user system where i never plug any other headphones/microphones in, can i expect disabling pulse to be mostly painless?
<sudokode>	because you can install entries for each bootloader for each os in the efi boot manager
<sudokode>	why even worry about switching an os to upgrade your bootloader
<saivert>	sudokode: exactly and then you are back to using the efi itself as a boot manager
<tomty89>	sudokode: that's the same meh as in having multiple esps
<sudokode>	saivert: you use it as a boot manager anyway...
<sudokode>	you have to, even if you don't notice it
<saivert>	exactly what you try to get away from since relying on the efi itself for boot manager is bad
<sudokode>	from it, you execute your bootloaders
<tomty89>	sudokode: installing (as with package manager)bootloader in each os?
<sudokode>	saivert: don't know where you heard that
<th0rne>	score_under: i have pulse with just master volume, works fine.
<saivert>	efi is set up to only boot one boot loader
<tomty89>	that sounds so redundunt
<sudokode>	you have to go through the efi boot manager at every boot
<saivert>	that is what most people do for a reason. it is easy and it is reliable
<score_under>	th0rne, how did you disable per-application volume?
<homerj>	they changed kde themes on me
<saivert>	no i don't. i power on my computer and i see grub
<saivert>	efi only loads grub. it is the first boot entry in the boot order
<sudokode>	saivert: efibootmgr
<sudokode>	what's your timeout set to?
<th0rne>	score_under: i'm not sure, i thought it was disabled by default?
<poeticallyevil>	score_under: i don't understand, how does the volume control bother you ? why do you have pulse installed ?
<saivert>	what is efibootmgr? never heard ofit
<sudokode>	it's a program to manager your efi boot manager ;)
<saivert>	yes the linux tool that isn't run on boot
<sudokode>	if you wanna manage every os from the same bootloader, that's fine. but it's just as painful as it is on bios/mbr
<score_under>	poeticallyevil, pulse installed because it's a "sensible default" & skype uses it (thinking of either using apulse for skype or temporarily enabling pulse)
<tomty89>	wat
<saivert>	you run it once you have booted linux. so in that sense it is useless
<sudokode>	saivert: wat
<sudokode>	that's to manage it from your booted os
<saivert>	efi doesn't present a boot menu with a timeout. it just boots the entries in order configured
<tomty89>	saivert: or not even once
<sudokode>	it still runs every boot
<score_under>	th0rne, not for me it seems. luakit decided to play some flash ad at full blast which peeved me and prompted the question
<saivert>	my asus board at least doesn't do that
<tomty89>	yeah what does efibootmgr has to do with all this
<tomty89>	!wtf efibootmgr
<phrik>	tomty89: core/efibootmgr
<tomty89>	you mean this one?
<tomty89>	or something else
<saivert>	sudokode is just confused or his motherboard has a weird implementation
<sudokode>	saivert: my asus doesn't do that either because asus disables the efi boot menu. so any timeout just extends your boot time unreasonably
<sudokode>	to access the efi boot manager on asus, you use the advanced boot menu
<sudokode>	i.e. f12
<saivert>	well actually just hold f8 during post
<saivert>	shows the boot entries menu
<sudokode>	oh f8
<sudokode>	f12 is dell
<saivert>	otherwise is boots first entry. there is no timeout involved. that is grub/gummiboot/refind/syslinux/elilo specific
<poeticallyevil>	or f1 or f2, or tab or del
<sudokode>	saivert: no, it's also efi specific
<tomty89>	my asus use f2, and it doesn't have a very separate boot menu true, so i have to go into the main interface to get access to uefi/bios boot menu
<saivert>	no timeout i say. present proof or shut up
<sudokode>	saivert: increase the timeout in efibootmgr. you'll notice your boot time also increase
<saivert>	my motherboard does not have that feature
<saivert>	period
<tomty89>	that's why multiple esps would be more of a hassle for me
<sudokode>	then it's not efi
<sudokode>	!next
<phrik>	another satisfied customer! next!
<saivert>	asus p8z68-v pro with uefi boot
<sudokode>	efi-compliant*
<saivert>	it never shows a screen with boot entries and a timer couting down.
<saivert>	that isn't possible
<sudokode>	it doesn't have to
<saivert>	so why are you talking about timeout? stop it
<sudokode>	set the time to 60 seconds
<tomty89>	set where?
<sudokode>	see if it increases your boot time
<sudokode>	efibootmgr
<saivert>	so what? i just pauses during post for that time for no reason?
<tomty89>	sudokode: well i got 0 by default
<saivert>	without showing a menu? that is utter pointless
<sudokode>	ofc it is
<sudokode>	that's why you set it to 0 if it isn't already :p
<sudokode>	asus is weird
<saivert>	so quit talking about pointless shit irrelevant to my board in question
<sudokode>	you asked about it
<tomty89>	sudokode: so you mean use that menu instead of the grub menu? but why bother?
<sudokode>	no
<saivert>	you started talking about timeout feature that isn't present. do you have any examples of uefi compliant boards that actually do this?
<sudokode>	i'm saying there is a uefi boot manager that, on some boards, can be visibly seen, but in any case, its program is run
<sudokode>	it has to be
<sudokode>	the efi boot manager is what discovers all of your boot options
<sudokode>	including the legacy bios ones
<sudokode>	boot0004* hard drive
<sudokode>	boot0005* cd/dvd drive
<sudokode>	shit like that
<sudokode>	that's generated at boot by the efi boot manager
<saivert>	i currently dual boot arch linux and windows 8.1 both with uefi so one would think i know this
<tomty89>	so? what does it have to do with the advantage(s) multiple esps
<tomty89>	*of
<sudokode>	that part doesn't
<sudokode>	what i'm saying is because you have to install a bootloader in each os (where applicable), it can easier to let them install to their own esp instead of using one for all of them
<th0rne>	how to update mpd database?
<tomty89>	sudokode: you don't "have to" actually
<sudokode>	in other words, it's easier to have multiple boot points on the same drive with uefi
<sudokode>	tomty89: no you don't
<sudokode>	see where applicable
<th0rne>	i put a new album in my music dir, but it's not showing in ncmcpp.
<jasabella>	hmmm
<th0rne>	*ncmpcpp
<score_under>	th0rne, "u" key
<teraflop>	press u from ncmpcpp or mpc update
<th0rne>	thanks :)
<tomty89>	sudokode: yeah maybe you mean so distro installer which force you to
<tomty89>	*some distro
<sudokode>	yes, you don't have to do it this way
<sudokode>	but it does make it easier to multiboot
<sudokode>	it essentially replaces the legacy bios boot flag
<tomty89>	idk. it looks ugly to me. i found it insulting if i adapt my partition layout because of their "user-friendlyness"
<sudokode>	you don't have to. i'm just saying what's recommended for multiboot
<sudokode>	if you find another easier, ofc
<sudokode>	!sparta
<phrik>	this... is... #archlinux !!!
<conor_f>	i'm having some issues with my touchpad. it cropped up a few days ago but now it's become unusable. i fully updated earlier today and the issue persists. any ideas what's up? i'm using i3 if that helps
<tomty89>	i don't even have any bootloader installed in terms of package
<conor_f>	could it be an issue with me having only ~50mb of space on my root partition?
<pid1>	teraflop, i don't think mpc update works anymore. i may be mistaken.
<namarrgon>	you can't rely on multiple esps being compatible with everthing that has an 'uefi' sticker on it. the spec doesn't forbid it but windows for example will not install if it finds more than one esp on a disk.
<pid1>	teraflop, ignore that.
<pid1>	totally still in the man page. i must have been thinking of something else.
<teraflop>	pid1: np
<fungle>	conor_f: i dont think 50mb for root is enough to use arch
<fungle>	!give conor_f wiki synpatics
<phrik>	conor_f: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/macbookpro8,1/8,2/8,3_(2011)
<namarrgon>	neither do have the uefi vendors have to support it so you might be only able off the first esp, or a radom one, or not at all.
<conor_f>	well i have 15gb allocated, but only 50mb free
<namarrgon>	*able to boot
<fungle>	!give conor_f wiki touchpad
<phrik>	conor_f: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/touchpad_synaptics
<fungle>	conor_f: ^maybe this
<teraflop>	pid1: create-database is deprecated maybe it was that
<pid1>	^probably, thanks.
<pid1>	maybe mpd update-database as well?
<conor_f>	fungle: thanks - it's difficult to browse because my mouse randomly clicks and scrolls all over the browser
<teraflop>	uhmm i cant test right now
<fungle>	conor_f: also you probably want to clear out some stuff in root
<plekhov>	i have a problem with my dropbox on arch (which has worked well for years) - it suddenly stopped syncing many (but not all) of my folders and when i empty the cache, and restart, it immediately starts filling up the cache again ... my data is about 100g, but it tries to add more than 15g to my cache ... and still not syncing many recent changes i made ...  anyone any idea what might be wrong?
<fungle>	conor_f: you might have a lot of cache space filled up, like /var/cache/pacman and maybe journal logs
<conor_f>	fungle: i tried, but i can't see what's taking up all the memory. i've cleaned pacman's cache, run df and i can't really tell where to remove stuff from
<plekhov>	i did also unlink and relink - but that did not do much (although it's after that that it started to fill the dropbox cache, i think)
<earnestly>	demize: http://a.pomf.se/qlxjjx.png this stuff is hard...
<tomty89>	conor_f: du
<tomty89>	conor_f: like starting with `sudo du -d 1 -x /`
<tomty89>	and -h makes it easier to read
<earnestly>	demize: and i don't know how to do range based matches, or in other words, how to deal with the title region
<th0rne>	anyone use beets? how to maintain mp3 and flac side-by-side in lib? wouldn't one overwrite the other or at least that they get merged naughtily together?
<fungle>	conor_f: go to root directory run sudo du -hs * | sort -h
<tomty89>	make good use of -d instead of -s, save you the cds
<arch-tk>	earnestly: you what?
<conor_f>	7.5g in usr, 5.4g in var (probably log files as i haven't set up logrotate), 1.5g root, nothing else major
<conor_f>	why would /usr be so big?
<earnestly>	arch-tk: vim syntax
<arch-tk>	earnestly: are you trying to write a syntax for pony?
<hyo0301>	guys halp!!
<thrice>	no
<arch-tk>	earnestly: i was thinking of doing it, i have experience writing syntax highlighting for vim.
<earnestly>	arch-tk: that's been done
<hyo0301>	i expected i didnt need much memory for arch
<arch-tk>	earnestly: what are you doing vim syntax for then?
<arch-tk>	earnestly: email?
<hyo0301>	but now i only hsve 2gb left
<earnestly>	arch-tk: this format, you see
<hyo0301>	how do i add more memory to partition?
<arch-tk>	earnestly: can i have the full text?
<tomty89>	conor_f: well you can go on by changing / to /usr
<arch-tk>	and not a txt.png
<earnestly>	arch-tk: http://ix.io/iti
<tomty89>	conor_f: might tell you something
<hyo0301>	i have 150gb free space in a partition
<tomty89>	conor_f: but basically
<sudokode>	conor_f:  expac -hm '%m %n' | sort -h
<hyo0301>	someone pls :(
<conor_f>	i'd like to get my touchpad working first though... got an exam on tuesday and this is really hurting my study :s
<pid1>	hyo0301, you mean storage, not memory.
<hyo0301>	^ yes
<tomty89>	conor_f: big /usr means you installed too much stuff
<sudokode>	/usr is where most of your installed files will go
<arch-tk>	earnestly: what are you trying to match?
<sudokode>	as /lib and /bin and /sbin now point to /usr
<hyo0301>	pid1: is it even possible?
<sudokode>	so / is smaller and /usr is bigger than usual
<rafaelsoaresbr>	hyo0301, do you want to add a swapfile? or more storage space?
<conor_f>	didn't know that sudokode - thanks
<hyo0301>	or do i have to live with the only memory i added to /dev/sda3
<earnestly>	arch-tk: i'm trying to write a syntax file for this
<pid1>	quit begging for help and you might get an answer.
<hyo0301>	rafaelsoaresbr: more storage space, swap file isn't necessar
<oozbooz>	hyo0301, don't confuse ram (menory) and storage (hdd, ssd) ... do you use lvm, raid
<sudokode>	conor_f: ls -l /
<tomty89>	my flash memory is running out!
<earnestly>	arch-tk: i can get the filename with /\%^\s\+/
<demize>	earnestly: yeah, i don't envy you..
<pid1>	hyo0301, go nuts  http://gparted.sourceforge.net/
<phrik>	title: gparted -- a free application for graphically managing disk device partitions (at gparted.sourceforge.net)
<pid1>	tomty89, download more ram.
<arch-tk>	earnestly: well yes
<pid1>	=p
<arch-tk>	earnestly: but which part exactly are you having difficulty matching?
<arch-tk>	earnestly: i mean some of this has to be pretty piss easy surely.
<hyo0301>	oozbooz: none of those? i sed windows disk manager lol
<conor_f>	turned out i didn't have a synaptics touchpad conf file in /etc, but i started x on a different runlevel with the default config moved to /etc/ and there's no difference
<hyo0301>	pid1: i hope it works!
<demize>	earnestly: i wonder if you could check for blanklines+text+blanklines and then have between there and the next set of blanklines be the title..
<hyo0301>	pid1: i basically just want to add more storage to my current arch linux bootable cfdisk
<arch-tk>	demize: you can
<oozbooz>	hyo0301, so you dual boot windows and arch?
<earnestly>	arch-tk: try matching any number of authors on the right side, and then the date
<tomty89>	bootable cfdisk?
<oozbooz>	hyo0301, as people mentioned ... boot with gparted iso and resize your partitions
<holomorph>	writing syntax files :(
<demize>	earnestly: anyway, looks fancy thus far :)
<earnestly>	arch-tk: http://ix.io/itj
<sudokode>	conor_f: x also pulls from /usr/share/x11/xorg.conf.d/
<arch-tk>	earnestly: could you run windows xp in a virtual machine, take a screenshot of the file, and in paint, highlight exactly what you want to match.
<arch-tk>	right.
<sudokode>	just like systemd, if you wanna edit those default configs, copy them to /etc/x11/xorg.conf.d/
<sudokode>	modify there
<conor_f>	i don't know what to modify in this to make it work like...
<sudokode>	what's not working?
<sudokode>	and what do you expect?
<conor_f>	i haven't been messing with any configs recently to cause this
<conor_f>	mouse acting erratically - clicking randomly, scrolling randomly, not responding to input correctly
<sudokode>	wireless?
<conor_f>	21:27 < sudokode> and what do you expect?
<conor_f>	21:27 < sudokode> and what do you expect?
<conor_f>	(sorry, mouse pasting)
<conor_f>	no, touchpad
<sudokode>	heh
<sudokode>	oh right
<sudokode>	hm
<sudokode>	odd. i don't know anything about touchpads
<darkelement>	i am unable to run /usr/bin/vmware-user because there is no /proc/fs/vmblock/dev directory. how can i install vmblock?
<sudokode>	someone will though
<earnestly>	demize: http://ix.io/itl/vim
<sudokode>	earnestly!
<kristof>	still dealing with dat ident timeout
<conor_f>	hopefully sudokode
<sudokode>	kristof: why are you using ident?
<earnestly>	demize: i don't have to match all of that stuff, but the stage_header will.  so either i need to match and make it transparent or somehow not match... hmm
<hyo0301>	oozbooz: boot with gparted iso? wat?
<kristof>	sudokode: i'm not
<sudokode>	kristof: freenode?

<arch-tk>	er..
<earnestly>	for example
<arch-tk>	right...
<sudokode>	i wish ifconfig.me wasn't so slow
<earnestly>	but don't worry
<arch-tk>	earnestly: but semicolons are vim syntax
<arch-tk>	i thought the regex passed could use any vim regex syntax
<earnestly>	arch-tk: i have another idea.  match anything that's /^\s.*/ that isn't the beginning of the file
<earnestly>	arch-tk: not sure why /\[^\%^\]^\s.*/ doesn't work
>nickserv<	identify ****
<darkelement>	i am unable to run /usr/bin/vmware-user because there is no /proc/fs/vmblock/dev directory. how can i install vmblock?
<earnestly>	arch-tk: or rather, don't \[ just [
<hyo0301>	oozbooz:
<earnestly>	but still
<earnestly>	maybe not line 1 will work
<hyo0301>	http://a.pomf.se/nwfmmo.png
<reisio>	darkelement: you start the vmware service?
<hyo0301>	55.7gb is my current arch running on
<earnestly>	nope ;/
<demize>	earnestly: hmm, do you know if vim supports \k?
<darkelement>	reisio, yes, it says to run the vmware-user command after i do vmware-config-tools.pl
<hyo0301>	i want it to join with the new partition that's 146gb
<earnestly>	demize: it does
<darkelement>	however, it is unable to execute that command
<earnestly>	demize: although, what does your \k do?
<demize>	pcre \k where it drops everything before that match
<tomty89>	darkelement: have you tried modprobe or check with lsmod?
<demize>	as in, everything matched before \k
<earnestly>	\k in vim is a keyword character, excluding digits
<arch-tk>	demize: no
<darkelement>	tomty89, no, but i know that the /proc/ directory where vmblock should be is not there.
<earnestly>	it does have \@<=
<arch-tk>	demize: http://www.vimregex.com/
<hyo0301>	someone help?
<phrik>	title: vim regular expressions 101 (at www.vimregex.com)
<darkelement>	i've not used lsmod or modprobe.
<earnestly>	which requires a match behind
<oozbooz>	hyo0301, so i see windows partition, but which partitions do you use for arch?
<earnestly>	arch-tk: heh, no
<earnestly>	arch-tk: :h pattern
<hyo0301>	oozbooz: sda4 is for arch
<earnestly>	demize: anyway, vim is nfa
<demize>	earnestly: i meant for variable-lenght lookbehind which pcre at least doesn't support
<tomty89>	darkelement: the vmblock kernel module set it up
<tomty89>	darkelement: you don't "install" thing to /proc
<hyo0301>	oozbooz: the 143gb one is the "free space" that i want to merge with the arch one
<darkelement>	ok, then why won't the /usr/bin/vmware-user command not run?
<tomty89>	darkelement: whether you have the module is another matter
<earnestly>	demize: i just don't know why you can't exclude \%^
<darkelement>	ok
<earnestly>	demize: \%^ is beginning of file
<oozbooz>	hyo0301, ... and stop panicking ... breath ... do couple lumber jacks
<earnestly>	demize: similarly \%1l is line 1
<tomty89>	darkelement: and have it doesn't necessarily mean it's loaded
<earnestly>	demize: and why [^\%1l] doesn't exclude it
<darkelement>	tomty89, alright, what should i do?
<hyo0301>	oozbooz: sorry.. i'm very worried i will have to reinstall whole arch again
<tomty89>	darkelement: try modprobe vmblock!
<darkelement>	sorry

<earnestly>	i should use \@<! for quotes...
<earnestly>	and urls
<tomty89>	darkelement: well so it's not installed, or not installed correctly for the current kernel
<darkelement>	yep
<oozbooz>	hyo0301, so practicing arch install  will make you even better linux guru... ;-)
<arch-tk>	earnestly: no..
<arch-tk>	you shouldn
<hyo0301>	oozbooz: stop joking around i'm dying
<arch-tk>	there's a syn highlight feature which does that for you
<demize>	earnestly: hmm... what about a negative lookbehind?
<hyo0301>	oozbooz: i have 25gb of files downloaded on arch already, i don't want to undo
<oozbooz>	hyo0301, 25gb of what? you don't want to re-download due to slow connection or ... why?
<hyo0301>	oozbooz: exactly

<phrik>	title: vim documentation: pattern (at vimdoc.sourceforge.net)
<darkelement>	tomty89, i wanted to know how to install it, that's what i really was asking.
<darkelement>	tomty89, do you know how?
<hyo0301>	oozbooz: i just want to add those 140gb of free space i shrunk my c:\ to
<demize>	earnestly: cool
<oozbooz>	hyo0301, how much free space do you have on windows partition?
<tomty89>	darkelement: no idea, also depends on how did you install vmware
<arch-tk>	earnestly: i think it's something like syn region quote start=\" skip=\\\" end=\"
<tomty89>	like via a aur package or some "official" package from vmware site
<hyo0301>	oozbooz: windows 720gb
<earnestly>	arch-tk: ?
<arch-tk>	will match anything between " and " but not break at \"
<darkelement>	i installed it on my windows machine
<earnestly>	arch-tk: quotes in this are email quotes.  > foo bar said
<hyo0301>	oozbooz: i had 800gbsomething, but i shrunk it so i could add it to my arch
<arch-tk>	oh
<arch-tk>	thats what you mean.
<ox33>	hi all. is there some speedtesting app for the terminal, to test download speeds?
<oozbooz>	hyo0301, total size of windows part is 720g. but how much of that is used ?
<earnestly>	arch-tk: syn region stage_url display start="<" skip="\\[<>]" end=">" oneline
<hyo0301>	oozbooz: i don't know, like 100gb or less
<reisio>	ox33: wget -o - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sivel/speedtest-cli/master/speedtest_cli.py | python
<tomty89>	darkelement: i don't get what you mean
<earnestly>	arch-tk: the problem with that is if you do "<" in text, it will start it.  i hoped that a zero width match would mean that "< won't trigger it
<earnestly>	arch-tk: i guess i could just require a space before it
<reisio>	ox33: just keep in mind isps are happy to trick you for tests, and throttle you for real things
<darkelement>	tomty89, i installed vmware on my windows computer, and installed arch as a vm.
<earnestly>	or not...
<hyo0301>	oozbooz: why does that matter? i have 140gb free
<tomty89>	darkelement: oh so arch is a guest. but sorry i don't know much about vmware. probably you need some guest package like with virtualbox
<earnestly>	demize: i just want to know how to make ^\s.* skip the first line
<hyo0301>	can someone help me?
<darkelement>	tomty89: yea, alright
<darkelement>	i'm working on it
<reisio>	hyo0301: someone can, yes
<wasamasa>	hyo0301: the way to find out is by asking your real question, baka
<hyo0301>	wasamasa: but no one answers with an answer
<holomorph>	wasamasa: that individual likes to don the nick 'spoonfeedme'
<tomty89>	hyo0301: you can delete the partitions you don't need in gparted and see if you can expand the arch one
<wasamasa>	i prefer feed me
<earnestly>	demize: you can use \%() to turn off subexpressions while still using ()
<darkelement>	alright, what happened to my dwm i rebooted and i may not know how to restart it so i can use firefox
<arch-tk>	earnestly: your [^\%^] doesn't work because it's zero width...
<earnestly>	arch-tk: \%^ isn't zero width?
<jasabella>	hi arch-tk :)
<arch-tk>	it is
<oozbooz>	hyo0301, 140gb partition is formatted with ext4.. are you sure it is nothing there?
<earnestly>	or it is
<earnestly>	arch-tk: why should that matter?
<hyo0301>	oozbooz:  i literally just formatted it 10 sec before that scrot to see if i was able to add it to arch then
<earnestly>	arch-tk: you can include [^$]
<tomty89>	hyo0301: mount it somewhere *shrug*
<arch-tk>	earnestly: yes, hmm, it's an interesting concept and it makes sense in a corner of my brain but i don't know why.
<jasabella>	is hyo trying to install arch?
<hyo0301>	no
<hyo0301>	trying to add more storage
<arch-tk>	i guess it's like saying "this must start at this point" vs "this must not start at this point" a point which is in effect a singularity can be the beginning but in reality any point infinitely close next to it could be said to be not it but also it
<holomorph>	more like trying to suck the lifeblood out of the channel
<oozbooz>	hyo0301, if you have formatted partition and you can mount it within arch and use it for storage
<hyo0301>	then i did the freaking right thing
<tomty89>	though the space would only be available under the mountpoint
<tomty89>	don't expect it to get merged or fusioned
<hyo0301>	it won't?!?!
<tomty89>	like if you mount it to /storage, then the space would only be available for things you put under there, but not /home or so
<tomty89>	mount 101, isn't it?
<tomty89>	or maybe mount 001
<hyo0301>	i understood that ._.
<jasabella>	tomty... i think a lot of new peopld dont realise that the linux/unix approach to storage is different to that of windows
<hyo0301>	dont't know how to mount it tho

<darkelement>	reisio: that does nothing.
<jasabella>	pulseaudio is being annoying :/
<darkelement>	this is in vmware if that helps at all
<hyo0301>	tomty89: that was the wrong wiki
<tomty89>	reisio: i am too fuzzy to accept that for starting a terminal :p
<reisio>	darkelement: you'll have to set it, then

<tomty89>	hyo0301: well yes, because you didn't have to entry for / in /etc/fstab, and luckily you didn't
<hyo0301>	tomty89: is it because it's type: 83 linux and not type: 42 sfs
<tomty89>	*two
<earnestly>	or not
<hyo0301>	.-.
<tomty89>	hyo0301: you don't usually mount to a same mountpoint twice, especially not for /
<arch-tk>	earnestly: just try ^\n\n not ^\n\n$
<hyo0301>	tomty89: so now i just have to "mount /dev/sda* /mnt"?
<hyo0301>	then reboot
<hyo0301>	nothing else?
<tomty89>	no
<darkelement>	it's fine now, nvm
<tomty89>	no for wong, not nothing
<earnestly>	arch-tk: nope :/
<tomty89>	*wrong
<earnestly>	arch-tk: title is basically, two newlines then any number of lines, then two new lines
<earnestly>	hm
<earnestly>	that could be too general
<tomty89>	hyo0301: first, if you want to use that partition for storage in a long term, using /mnt as its mountpoint might not be very ideal; but that's your choice anyway
<hyo0301>	tomty89: what would be your choice?
<fungle>	earnestly: you need to turn on a flag that goes over newlines i think
<fungle>	earnestly: \m or something
<tomty89>	hyo0301: second, if you want it to be mounted on every boot, have an fstab entry for it
<tomty89>	hyo0301: anywhere appropriate for its purpose?
<hyo0301>	tomty89: anime and /mu/sic
<tomty89>	hyo0301: and don't forget you can mkdir :p
<earnestly>	fungle: \m enables magic, i can't find anything which mentions newlines in patterns except where it explains how \n matches a newline
<hyo0301>	'-'
<earnestly>	fungle: hmm, there is more
<tomty89>	hyo0301: you can mount it under somewhere under your home user directory, like /home/hyo0301/anime_and_music, or just /anime_and_music if you prefer; and i'm no one to tell you which one is a good/better practice
<arch-tk>	earnestly: oh..
<tomty89>	hyo0301: just make sure that directory exists
<fungle>	earnestly: yea sorry, i dont know the exact flag, but matches are linewise, and if you want to match across lines you need to turn it on or something
<tomty89>	hyo0301: it won't be created automagically when boot unless you use certain option in the fstab entry
<tomty89>	hyo0301: `man mount` for details
<earnestly>	fungle: "on the other hand, vim's ^ and $ always match at embedded newlines"
<tomty89>	hyo0301: also `man fstab`
<earnestly>	fungle: it's a bit confusing, newlines \n match elsewhere
<tomty89>	hyo0301: that for a general idea about fstab
<hyo0301>	i can't exec manuals for some reason
<tomty89>	d:
<hyo0301>	unless i'm root

<tomty89>	superbia: correctly?
<superbia>	yes
<superbia>	the wiki is very brief on these things
<superbia>	and im basically left high&dry with 99% done....
<ausseh>	wiki didn't really explain... how do i use makepkg -s?
<ausseh>	path to file?
<d_garbage>	ausseh, if you want to use it, read the manual, properly
<polyzen>	ausseh, checked the man page?
<holomorph>	ausseh: reading is a virtue.
<d_garbage>	the build system is very nice and simple, it wont take long to get used to it
<superbia>	does anyone have a virtue to help me with my grub ?
<ausseh>	got it! cd /path-to-directory
<d_garbage>	it's funny every time you see someone talking about doing pacman -u you know they didn't read the manual
<tomty89>	superbia: try change 1 to y
<ausseh>	that wasn't my issue, and i read about installing... i just didn't know what it meant about "in the directory" until i remembered "cd"
<d_garbage>	because if you had, why would you? :)
<tomty89>	superbia: in the /etc/default/grub option
<tomty89>	superbia: grub_enable_cryptodisk=y
<superbia>	tomty89: doing.. wait
<superbia>	tomty89: installation finished. no error reported
<superbia>	tomty89: can i /exec -o reboot ?
<tomty89>	 /exec -o reboot?
<superbia>	exit all
<superbia>	and reboot
<superbia>	if this aint working.. il be so pissed
<superbia>	thanks for the fix tomty89  !!!!
<tomty89>	superbia: better regen your grub.cfg again
<ausseh>	after doing pacman -u /home/linux/downloads/teamviewer.xz, i get "could not find or read package"
<tomty89>	superbia: before you reboot
<superbia>	tomty89: ok doing
<namarrgon>	ausseh: wrong filename
<ausseh>	o_o i've checked the file now and that's not even there
<ausseh>	well /teamviewer.tar.xz
<ausseh>	nonetheless, not working >:|
<namarrgon>	ausseh: wrong filename
<ausseh>	this file will still be in my downloads folder?
<superbia>	tomty89: il probably wont come online anymore, because its late.. either way thanks for helping me out :)    il come tommorow at similar time to report if it worked.. gnight man ;)
<namarrgon>	ausseh: yes, the pacakge that makepkg generates will end in *.pkg.tar.xz by default
<tomty89>	ok good nite
<ausseh>	thanks... yet again.
<ausseh>	wth is the "teamviewer daemon" and why does it need to be running for install?

<halosghost>	lol
<mocha_bean>	kek
<hyo0301>	saying i'm annoyed about long install process = troll? :o halosghost
<halosghost>	:|
<earnestly>	mocha_bean: honestly, i have no idea
<hyo0301>	basically an opinion = troll? ._.
<earnestly>	why it behaves like that
<earnestly>	i wouldn't ban vampires, just put them on ignore
<hyo0301>	then earnestly's opinion about me being annyoing is troll?
<kristof>	arch's install process is pretty long if you include all the goodies that most people want.
<earnestly>	kristof: including the configuration?
<d_garbage>	oh well that is the first person i've ignored in ages, been doing not to bad
<hyo0301>	earnestly: i'm a vampire for having an opinion ? :o
<teraflop>	hyo0301: hey what's the point of making such comments ... here, it sound's to me trolling or masochism
<earnestly>	the number of packages you want is merely the time it takes for you to type them out, if you don't have a list.  configuring everything is the time sink
<kristof>	this was fine back when i had loads of time to pretend like i was a linux sysadmin. but i work 45 hours a week, so on occasion things that require even a little bit of reading or thought is slightly hassling.
<d_garbage>	too*
<dan39>	dont use arch then
<mocha_bean>	kwalletmanager doesn't open... dafuq
<halosghost>	holomorph: wb
<kristof>	earnestly: yeah, by installing, i meant configuring. they're completely different, i apologize for the misuse of language.
<holomorph>	halosghost: spanks
<halosghost>	holomorph: ❤
<hyo0301>	teraflop: what comment? install process = boring?
<holomorph>	halosghost: it was scary out there!
<kristof>	earnestly: my frame of reference was that when most people talk about installing an operating system, what they mean to say is from start to finish, the time it takes to have a lot of software that works the way you want it to.
<halosghost>	17.39      hyo0301 │ manuals in linux are bs, they don't explain shit, they explain as if you have already got years of linux experience ._.
<halosghost>	^ pure troll
<halosghost>	nothing more
<teraflop>	mainly the apple shit, that too
<earnestly>	kristof: ah, i'm a little more technical in that regard
<mocha_bean>	kwalletmanager just opens a blank window and then freezes
<hyo0301>	that is an opinion, trolling is not saying your opinions about stuff halosghost
<earnestly>	kristof: i'm also quite happy and can work with, most defaults.  the time to configure is pretty low
<rgb-one>	i think i read somewhere pacman uses asciidoc to generate its manpages. is this so?
<kristof>	earnestly: so am i normally. it was just that the comment was phrased in an imprecise manner and i responded with the same language.
<halosghost>	hyo0301: k
<halosghost>	phrik: give hyo0301 k
<phrik>	hyo0301: http://cdn01.cdnwp.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/14/jennifer-lawrence-10.gif
<earnestly>	kristof: ah, i didn't see the comment, fair enough
<hyo0301>	halosghost: you just defined troll
<halosghost>	i find arch's install to be a few hours long, but that's mostly because every time i do a new install, i take the time to change things about my workflow i've been meaning to change for a while
<earnestly>	mocha_bean: see if it collects any errors on stdout/err if started from... oh
<halosghost>	means i end up spending a fair bit more time on each install that is really needed to get it usable to a state i like
<earnestly>	halosghost: by install, you mean install and configure?
<d_garbage>	"the fanger will also occasionally table (sadly, almost inevitably empty) threats about leaving your community and going off to use some other software; as if the dependency relationship is somehow reversed and it is you, the community, that will suffer if they leave."
<halosghost>	earnestly: yes
<earnestly>	halosghost: why you no dotfiles? :p
<halosghost>	earnestly: talking about the bare-bones arch install, it's lightning fast
<halosghost>	earnestly: oh, i do
<halosghost>	earnestly: but again, it's that time i take to make all the changes to my dotfiles that i've been meaning to do for a while anyway :p
<earnestly>	it takes me about 3 minutes (not including pkg downloads)
<kristof>	earnestly: there's a lot of stuff that comes with using arch linux that can be pretty daunting. learning how to use printers on linux, for example, took me ages.
<hyo0301>	"3 minutes"
<earnestly>	and then everything else is spread over "when i feel like it"
<halosghost>	earnestly: sounds fair
<earnestly>	kristof: yeah
<hyo0301>	earnestly: without the manuals and experience?
<earnestly>	kristof: but did you constantly complain in irc about every little thing, demand to be spoonfed (literally ask this) and then whine about how it's so much harder to read for weeks because "time is money"?
<teraflop>	oh i have a friend that takes notes directly in latex, i think is even worst than dealing with printers
<earnestly>	kristof: i don't remember you doing that
<d_garbage>	i did have then ignored for several moths though :p
<hyo0301>	those should add atleast 200 hours to the process
<d_garbage>	months*
<earnestly>	teraflop: latex is a fairly simple markup format, the hardest part is learning some of the basic packages
<kristof>	earnestly: i think i badgered sudokode because i wasn't seeing my printer on my network
<kristof>	it ended up being that i didn't have a particular service running when i thought i did
<beest>	i misread that as "i think i banged sudokode" and thought my life had changed
<kristof>	earnestly: but no, i wasn't a help vampire.
<d_garbage>	lol
<halosghost>	earnestly: it is a lot more boiler-plate than other markups (e.g., rst), but it offers a ton more control
<halosghost>	s/than/for simple documents &/
<earnestly>	kristof: i've seen some kids, these days as soon as there's a challenge or a non-obvious puzzle, they give up
<earnestly>	kristof: even in games, and never finish them
<kristof>	earnestly: god, game puzzles used to be so much better
<earnestly>	even with the internet available to tell them literally everything
<beest>	i can check "earnestly complaining about kids these days" off my list today
<earnestly>	kristof: idk, old game puzzles can be pretty silly
<kristof>	earnestly: and you know, i think in the 90s and early naughts, having a puzzle in a game was just sort of a given. of course something was going to be nontrivial. nowadays you must be in the puzzle game genre to have a puzzle
<d_garbage>	it's a sad trend. aparently that's why the ends of games these days are rubbish? because the figures show that most people don't finish them so all the attention goes to the beginning (which is also the bit that gets reviewed)
<kristof>	earnestly: i'm thinking of like zelda style puzzles
<earnestly>	kristof: ah, i was thinking of seria stuff
<d_garbage>	vicious circle, sounds like
<kristof>	earnestly: or, how about this, half life puzzles
<earnestly>	kristof: there were puzzles in half life?
<teraflop>	earnestly: nah, my 3 years old nephew plays supertux2 better than i do
<kristof>	earnestly: that was one of the best parts of that series
<beest>	we do still have even combat-heavy games like dark souls loaded with puzzles (even though they're often cleverly disguised as not-puzzles)
<d_garbage>	some physics puzzles in hl2
<earnestly>	kristof: i don't remember any of them :o
<kristof>	earnestly: half-life 2 had some really great physics puzzles and situational puzzles
<kristof>	timing, too
<earnestly>	kristof: i thought that was just... gameplay?
<kristof>	i recall 3/5 of it being puzzles
<kristof>	and 2/5 being shooting
<beest>	i don't really remember any of what might pass for puzzles in the half-life series being much more puzzly than a platformer
<d_garbage>	the one with the see-saw and the bricks, the one with the other see-saw and the barrels the one with the see-saw and, hmmm quite a lot of those come to think of it
<beest>	oh, the physics "puzzles".
<earnestly>	i can't remember any of the puzzles except the one obvious one which forced you to stack breeze blocks on a see-saw
<d_garbage>	yeah :)
<beest>	i can't really count those
<earnestly>	everything else was a blur
<kristof>	earnestly: well, ok, then my point remains again. in older games, having to think about things rather than just going forward was sort of a given
<earnestly>	oh, and the boat gate with some weight
<d_garbage>	i enjoyed playing with the tame ant-lions
<earnestly>	kristof: the funny thing is, i can't remember puzzles probably because that was just part of "going forward"
<kristof>	earnestly: i vaguely remember there being almost-puzzles
<d_garbage>	then there were the 'energy ball' puzzles
<earnestly>	oh, those things
<beest>	puzzles in the same way getting around in tomb raider was a puzzle, i guess
<earnestly>	i guess
<d_garbage>	the g-man cameo's are always fun
<d_garbage>	you just know when they finally end that game it will be obvious they were making it up as they go along, just like tv shows
<earnestly>	oh, there was also the explosives which released a large beam to break down a set of doors
<d_garbage>	yeah, on the canal
<earnestly>	except you can actually hit the explosive barrel from the water and skip the entire section
<d_garbage>	heh, speed run style?
<kristof>	can someone remind me why we don't just download software from upstream and have to rely on package managers?
<earnestly>	d_garbage: that's what they do, yeah
<kristof>	besides uninstalling.
<d_garbage>	kristof, that would be the 'management' part
<kristof>	okay, that's fair
<earnestly>	kristof: because maintainers are the last line of defense
<d_garbage>	also dependencies
<earnestly>	and i'd never give it up
<earnestly>	for an appstore model
<kristof>	appstores are just maintainers, i don't want that either
<kristof>	me -> website -> oooh, software! -> click -> installed
<earnestly>	besides, you can just download from software
<earnestly>	and install it
<earnestly>	it's not hard
<kristof>	earnestly: what about if they rely on libraries?
<d_garbage>	except it's 'write pkgbuild' not 'click'
<earnestly>	it will tell you
<kristof>	true
<teraflop>	kristof: or use paludis ^
<earnestly>	kristof: the library situation is so overblown as well
<earnestly>	kristof: but programming language hipsters who want to nih everything
<earnestly>	like rust's crapfest of a manager "cargo"
<kristof>	development library package managers are useful
<halosghost>	lolcargo
<earnestly>	you have managers that manage managers
<kristof>	i'm not saying cargo is good, just that
<earnestly>	kristof: they're almost never are
<earnestly>	kristof: neither is cabal
<kristof>	:/
<halosghost>	lolcabal
<earnestly>	python otoh, is quite good
<kristof>	maven
<earnestly>	or even c
<earnestly>	make your software non-shit and friendly to install and suddenly it's widely available
<halosghost>	there are c library package managers?
<halosghost>	oh
<halosghost>	nevermind :p
<earnestly>	python is some of the nicest packages to create
<edit>	ok.. should this be what i have in my, /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
<earnestly>	very friendly
<earnestly>	kristof: ponylang btw

<phrik>	title: hastebin (at hastebin.com)
<earnestly>	kristof: if you're still into these kinds of things
<halosghost>	phrik: give edit pastebins
<phrik>	edit: some good, sane pastebins are: <https://ptpb.pw/>, <https://bpaste.net/>, <https://gist.github.com/>, <http://sprunge.us/>, <https://ix.io/>, <http://pastie.org/> or <http://codepad.org/>.
<kristof>	earnestly: yo, i love agha
<earnestly>	kristof: ponylang has a non-blocking, no read/write barrier, concurrent gc
<earnestly>	which is.. interesting
<edit>	>??
<earnestly>	actor model is interesting
<halosghost>	phrik: give edit hastebin
<phrik>	edit: hastebin: for when you need javascript to share greenish blue plain text on a blueish green background
<earnestly>	see mit link for thesis about it
<kristof>	earnestly: no kidding? i know the azul jvm does that too
<earnestly>	kristof: azul uses read/write barriers
<kristof>	!
<earnestly>	and it's the zinc jvm with azul c4
<edit>	?
<kristof>	earnestly: i like the actor model a lot, especially with go
<earnestly>	kristof: http://www.azulsystems.com/sites/default/files//images/wp_pgc_zing_v5.pdf
<earnestly>	go insn't actor based at all
<earnestly>	turns out, i knew nothing about the actor model
<earnestly>	it's not like csp
<kristof>	earnestly: they're csp, but they might as well be actors. i modeled the differences between the two and unified both theories about a year and a half ago
<earnestly>	the thesis claims and demonstrates that the actor model is a superset of both functional and imperative styles
<earnestly>	kristof: ponylang's n-body code runs in 9.18s where the best c++ on shootout is 9.08s
<earnestly>	it's... interesting
<edit>	thanks for the help
<halosghost>	edit: i don't have js enabled, i can't read pastes on hastebin
<earnestly>	kristof: yeah, csp is nothing like the actor model.  the actor model itself is mostly carl hewitt, not hoare at all
<kristof>	earnestly: you can implement actors in terms of csp and then you end up with csp code being able to talk to actors and vice versa
<edit>	ok i'll pastebin, ok
<halosghost>	do not use pastebin.com
<edit>	?
<kristof>	earnestly: i had it alllllll elaborated, very specifically
<halosghost>	it's worse
<edit>	ok
<halosghost>	edit: just use ptpb.pw like the first thing i gave you mentioned
<teraflop>	edit: pastebin != pastebin.com
<edit>	dang
<kristof>	earnestly: except this is all on notebook paper, not online anywhere, though
<earnestly>	kristof: i think you really should read that thesis or even the wiki article on the actor model, because i thought like you.  the guys at ponylang gave me some nice resources.  turned out i knew nothing about the actor model
<kristof>	earnestly: yo, i have read that thesis
<mocha_bean>	who here uses kde 5.3?
<earnestly>	i thought it was like csp
<kristof>	earnestly: i'm pretty sure agha tried to unify both once too
<kristof>	earnestly: dude, i'm letting you know right now, i did a metric fuckton of reading on both
<teraflop>	mocha_bean: not me sorry, i also use nm and i do not have any isse.
<earnestly>	kristof: csp was before, so that's likely
<kristof>	earnestly: i'm very well aware of the differences
<earnestly>	oh good
<kristof>	earnestly: but i also managed to design actors in terms of csp. i tried doing it the other way around too but you end up with a lot of redundancy and it's not very efficient
<earnestly>	kristof: anyway, it's a new language, kind of interesting.  they have a mechanical proof of the type system as well
<kristof>	earnestly: that's nifty. i'll take a look at it
<earnestly>	it probably won't go anywhere, honestly
<earnestly>	i sort of hope it does, just to be different
<earnestly>	kristof: there is a vim syntax file for it and i added a syntastic checker.  holomorph added one for flycheck
<kristof>	earnestly: i can't find my notes right now but essentially an actor is something like a proc that reads from a named chan. that named chan is the mailbox
<earnestly>	kristof: but there are issues with that atm
<earnestly>	kristof: yeah, and you have an arbiter to manage the mail
<earnestly>	or receptionist as he calls it
<d_garbage>	mocha_bean, kde 5.3?
<kristof>	earnestly: i didn't have an arbiter manage the mail because i was, uh, unconcerned with safety at the time
<earnestly>	kristof: i don't think this is how ponylang itself works, but they did offer the gul thesis as a basis for what actor model is
<earnestly>	kristof: before javascript corrupted what "futures" mean and all that
<kristof>	earnestly: i also had a supervision system working, like erlang's
<earnestly>	kristof: but, very fast language, really easy to use c via there ffi.  it's interesting
<earnestly>	their*
<kristof>	earnestly: that is very interesting, i promise to read about it
<jasabelle>	hi
<reisio>	hi jasa
<halosghost>	hi
<th0rne>	hello.
<jasabelle>	i'm trying to install vmware player and it's complaining that gcc 5.1 isnt available;
<edit>	ok, here a new paste.
<edit>	http://codepad.org/km44hgam
<phrik>	title: c code - 39 lines - codepad (at codepad.org)
<d_garbage>	it's not in the repos yet. still in [testing]
<edit>	that what i need, right
<jasabelle>	short of installing gcc5.1 from testing, what should i do?
<vodik>	thats not c code!
<earnestly>	kristof: it appeared out of nowhere, i thought it was a joke (fim++).  came from imperial college london, mostly by sophia drossopoulou iirc
<kristof>	earnestly: anyway, what i've never seen before is a csp system that interacts with actors. and they seemed like they were almost the same thing because csp has anonymous procs reading from named channels, while actors have named procs reading from private mailboxes. but everything is just message sending at the end of the day and i figured one could be modeled in terms of the other
<edit>	omg..
<earnestly>	kristof: there's also the capabilities-secure side
<d_garbage>	rebuild the kernel with gcc 4.9
<vodik>	edit: you don't have any mirrors enabled
<kristof>	earnestly: huh?
<earnestly>	kristof: if you know of the e language: http://www.erights.org/elang/
<jasabelle>	omg

<halosghost>	vodik: ❤
<kristof>	earnestly: oh, right, i remember this
<teraflop>	oh boy my joke is getting worse ...
<halosghost>	teraflop: lol
<kristof>	earnestly: i've sort of run into this once in a while doing oo stuff
<kristof>	earnestly: you either make something private and nothing can get at it, or you make it public and everything can get at it
<kristof>	but perhaps only some object need to know about a particular method
<kristof>	earnestly: so you make it an inner class. but then no other class can talk to that inner class, so bam, you've lost flexibility again
<earnestly>	kristof: there's also a paper from msdn recently on this for c#: http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/170528/msr-tr-2012-79.pdf
<kristof>	so i've often wished for a syntax like public:a type foo(), which means that only objects of type a can call that method
<vodik>	kristof: talking about pimpl or whatever its called?
<kristof>	vodik: nuh uh
<earnestly>	kristof: https://github.com/causalityltd/ponyc/tree/master/packages
<phrik>	title: ponyc/packages at master · causalityltd/ponyc · github (at github.com)
<earnestly>	kristof: they do have generics
<kristof>	vodik: was talking about capabilities
<earnestly>	and interfaces/traits
<kristof>	earnestly: i've gotta run actually
<earnestly>	their tutorial atm mostly talks about their capability qualifiers
<earnestly>	kristof: it's quite haskell-y/rust-y when it comes to dealing with types
<earnestly>	and defining types for interfaces, such as "stringable", "ordered" whatever
<earnestly>	type map[k: (hashable box & comparable[k] box), v] is hashmap[k, v, hasheq[k]]
<earnestly>	type aliases aren't recursive though which is a bit meh
<earnestly>	they might add that

<d_garbage>
<theteapot_>	does anyone know the issue about composite managers and urxvt, where you can't have shadows and transparency?
<theteapot_>	does anyone know how to fix it?
<d_garbage>	not me
<d_garbage>	haven't used a composite manager since i stopped using compiz
<theteapot_>	damn
<theteapot_>	it is weird, because it is doing it fine if i have non-focused windows transparent (fine being they will have shadows)
<theteapot_>	oh.
<theteapot_>	i found it.
<theteapot_>	gawd i am thick.
<theteapot_>	the shadow was causing the window to be non-transparent.
<maxwell>	where can i find resources for setting up a printer on arch? (specifically canon imageclass mf4570dn)
<theteapot_>	-z fixes it

<arch-tk>	unless it's some really new printer and the company which makes it refuses to provide drivers or open source their magic.,
<netz>	so... having a small irritation. just installed networkmanager, enabled it, and started it, did a logout/in, and the applet is invisible in the systray on mate
<netz>	when i interact with it, it appears (there wasn't even a blank space for it, just a sliver) so i know the applet icon exists
<boblehest>	rofl, i first installed fedora-workstation, not knowing how bloated it was (and the fact that you get pretty much no choices during install).
<boblehest>	that image was 1.4 gb, then i downloaded the netinstall image, which is 2.0 gb, and only comes with a 'server' preset when installing packages.
<boblehest>	so i had to select another mirror to get the actual netinstall.. :p
<boblehest>	not sure why the image was bigger than workstation when you get to install less.
<thrice>	it's not
<thrice>	https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/21/server/x86_64/iso/
<phrik>	title: index of /pub/fedora/linux/releases/21/server/x86_64/iso (at dl.fedoraproject.org)
<thrice>	424m
<thrice>	also, fedora lets you use kickstart files if you want to customize package sets, which is pretty nice actually
<earnestly>	thrice: is that the workstation thing?
<boblehest>	oh, i misclicked, didn't i?
<thrice>	no, it's the netinst image that he was referring to
<earnestly>	ah
<boblehest>	yes, i did. :p i downloaded server then
<boblehest>	heh
<thrice>	or the dvd
<netz>	eh, i'll stick with arch <3
<boblehest>	ok, so it wasn't the netinstall image, but it was server, which i expected to be smaller than workstation.
<boblehest>	since workstation comes packed with software
<boblehest>	i just did a reinstall because i didn't want to go through everything it installed.
<thrice>	in fact, the install size if you do netinst + building up is probably smaller than arch, due to splitting out headers and such
<netz>	blarg.
<netz>	so, any idea why nm-applet is being finicky?
<thrice>	not based on your crappy description :-)
<boblehest>	thrice: yeah, i'm not really going for minimal though, i just don't want 90% of the applications to be unused.
<boblehest>	i'm not installing it for me either, i'm happy with arch.
<thrice>	indeed, me too :-)
<earnestly>	oh wow
<earnestly>	mpv has ab looping now
<arch-tk>	now?
<arch-tk>	you mean 10 years ago?
<earnestly>	no
<arch-tk>	it's _not_ new.
<sudokode>	earnestly: something smplayer has had since forever
<sudokode>	:>
<arch-tk>	i heard it being discussed about 6 months ago.
<earnestly>	sudokode: yeah
<netz>	thrice: description was accurate. the applet is invisible untill you interact with it, then it becomes visable.
<earnestly>	sudokode: also cmplayer
<sudokode>	never heard of it
<sudokode>	kmplayer yes
<sudokode>	gmplayer
<sudokode>	kaffeine had a great name but it used xine
<earnestly>	arch-tk: 2014-11-18 21:33:15, but new to me
<boblehest>	i've never used any other players than mplayer in linux.
<boblehest>	except for listening to music. all music players i've used suck in some way.
<holomorph>	a-b looping? cool
<sudokode>	boblehest: well, all of them are just frontends to other things
<sudokode>	mplayer, vlc, gstreamer, xine
<sudokode>	those are the big four. everything else came from that
<sudokode>	well now there's mpv
<boblehest>	is that a new and shiny player?
<holomorph>	yes
<boblehest>	the only thing i really don't like about mplayer is that the minimum seek possible is 10 seconds backward/forward
<boblehest>	you can probably make your own bindings though, i've never bothered to read the docs.
<ausseh>	when installing another desktop environment, will it be ready after pacman -s cinnamon? (installing from plasma 5)
<ausseh>	or is there more configuring to do?
<selby>	ausseh: you should be ready
<dan39>	there isnt a wiki page for it?
<dacoit>	the associated wiki will mention all minutia
<thrice>	hmm, i have't tried cinnamon before
<ausseh>	there is a wiki on it, but it doesn't say whether or not you should configure after you're already in a de
<selby>	ausseh: just change your ./initrc
<dacoit>	s/a/æ /:p
<dan39>	if he uses kdm i dont think xinitrc would have to be changed
<holomorph>	wow vim just crashed
<boblehest>	holomorph: are you using i3?
<ausseh>	i'll logout and check cinnamon
<dacoit>	some one flip the incident calendar
<boblehest>	dacoit: my last vim crash was yesterday, i believe.
<boblehest>	i'm eager to blame i3, but i don't have any proof.
<dan39>	vim has never crashed on m that i recall, and use it daily
<dacoit>	i dont doubt you :p i've never seen it is all
<holomorph>	boblehest: no, dwm. was editing a file, opened a new term which resized the term vim was in => crash
<dacoit>	and cant see how i3 would be involved
<boblehest>	ok, sometimes it crashes here when i focus another window.
<ausseh>	well that didn't work... but my icons are back :)
<boblehest>	err, it only crashes when focus is lost, to be exact.
<holomorph>	http://ix.io/ita hmph
<boblehest>	all crashes has happened just as the window loses focus.
<boblehest>	have*
<dino->	quick question i'm confused about. just upgraded. have a new /etc/gshadow.pacnew  in the past i merge this (carefully) with /etc/gshadow, but today the /etc/gshadow file is 000 perms so even root can't edit. unsure what to do here.
<dino->	what do people do with udpates to gshadow anyway like this? am i doing this wrong all along?
<earnestly>	dino-: shadow and gshadow is generated from passwd and group
<thrice>	shouldn't need to merge it, i don't think
<boblehest>	i'm also wondering why there is e.g. a passwd.pacnew when the original passwd has been modified anyway..?
<dacoit>	pacdiff. also 000 perms doesnt prevent root from editing
<dino->	ok, so i'll do the ones from passwd and group
<dino->	dacoit: well, i could chmod it, but was unsure if that was wise to do
<dacoit>	dino-: you dont need to
<dacoit>	it just means only root, not even the file's owner
<dino->	dacoit: hm, sudo vim has it ro.
<earnestly>	dino-: see grpconv and pwconv manuals
<earnestly>	don't use sudo vim...
<dacoit>	sudoedit
<earnestly>	vim, that can execute anything
<earnestly>	running as root? ;/
<holomorph>	boblehest: that description seems consistent with what happened here
<dino->	ok, i reach for that a lot because of handy vimdiff
<ausseh>	i have a really stupid question... (please don't say wiki). how do i access ~/.xinitrc? i would assume that since i'm running a desktop environment, that it would already be here.
<earnestly>	sudoedit or even just edit as non-root and save with tee
<ausseh>	and i can't seem to find it.
<holomorph>	ausseh: it need not exist
<earnestly>	dino-: :w !sudo tee %
<ausseh>	o.o
<boblehest>	holomorph: i've looked at vim's source once to try and figure out something. it's something i won't do again.
<ausseh>	nano ~/.xinitrc
<ausseh>	?
<dacoit>	thats my favourite trick :p
<boblehest>	vim's source code is scary to look at
<thrice>	ausseh: ~/.xinitrc is used if you launch with "startx"  .  if you use a login manager, like gdm, ssdm, etc, you don't need to touch it
<ausseh>	so how do i get cinnamon to pop up in my list of desktop environments upon boot?
<holomorph>	boblehest: indeed, it's scary
<dino->	ok, thank you
<thrice>	ausseh: is it not already?
<ausseh>	i installed cinnamon, however, it isn't available for selection.
<ausseh>	i don't see it.
<thrice>	ausseh: what about:  "ls /usr/share/xsessions" ?
<ausseh>	cinnamon is there
<ausseh>	throwing me off... :|
<thrice>	weird, maybe restart sddm or whatever you're using
<thrice>	(or, reboot)
<ausseh>	i'll go for reboot xd
<thrice>	it should appear in the drop down then
<lambdacomplex>	my screen is redder now

<lyonsb>	uhhh, how do you suppose that curl /sprunge would work without network access?
<maxwell>	what's a good app to print envelopes on linux
<polyzen>	dacoit, that with a landscape hkb taked up too much space

<d_garbage>	dynamicmetaflow, can you use sprunge or similar? pictures of text are annoying?
<dynamicmetaflow>	couldn't i just remove the wireless service altogether and install it again
<thrice>	dynamicmetaflow: bad config file, it seems
<dynamicmetaflow>	since for some reason it complains about that and i think the rfkill thing i did was to make it start the wireless in the beginning
<d_garbage>	dynamicmetaflow, oh right, i guess you can't get a connection at all on that machine then?
<dynamicmetaflow>	i can i have a usb ethernet card
<dynamicmetaflow>	it works in this case it's how i initially set up arch with it
<d_garbage>	handy
<dynamicmetaflow>	i'm thinking if i could install a terminal web browser
<d_garbage>	!sprunge
<dynamicmetaflow>	so i could do some digging around

<d_garbage>	3'rd times the charm :)

<dynamicmetaflow>	that's very hand
<d_garbage>	\o/
<dynamicmetaflow>	handy
<d_garbage>	it is
<earnestly>	dynamicmetaflow: ix.io and ptpb.pw work the same way
<earnestly>	dynamicmetaflow: many image and files bins work the same
<rena>	how to flag a package (not in aur) as out of date?
<earnestly>	ptpb < image.png
<rena>	preferrably from command line?
<d_garbage>	dynamicmetaflow, |& to include error output iirc

<phrik>	title: microsoft to stop producing windows versions - bbc news (at m.bbc.com)
<lambdacomplex>	rolling windows
<lambdacomplex>	i'm gonna call it arch nt
<earnestly>	rolling is the future
<earnestly>	everything makes sense
<lambdacomplex>	tell it to ubuntu
<earnestly>	ubuntu is going to disappear into a docker blackhole
<lambdacomplex>	did you hear about snappy?
<earnestly>	yes
<lambdacomplex>	what are your thoughts on it?
<bougyman>	ubuntu rolling is already an r&d thing
<earnestly>	not very much
<bougyman>	i don't think they'll die, i think they'll roll.
<earnestly>	but realistically, everything will roll
<earnestly>	eventually
<earnestly>	because it just makes sense
<bougyman>	rolling is good.
<earnestly>	"ci" and all that
<d_garbage>	sounds like marketing more than anything
<bougyman>	but with safe upgrade paths.
<earnestly>	everyone should use the latest upgrades
<rena>	a rolling distro gathers no cruft?
<lambdacomplex>	tell it to manjaro
<d_garbage>	nobody wanted to move from xp and then mostly stuck with 7 :p
<bougyman>	earnestly: you have to have checkpoints, though.
<earnestly>	bougyman: i hope that once everything is kept up to date, it'll provide both the incentive and the userbase to write migration tools like that
<bougyman>	that's what we're trying to finalize now.
<bougyman>	xbps2 will have checkpoint awareness, i hope.
<earnestly>	bougyman: so-so.  i wou;dn't say no, but i don't care if they're not available.
<earnestly>	linux is the most trivial os to roll back and fix
<bougyman>	not when you're moving /bin/ and /sbin/ and such.
<bougyman>	some stuff is big.
<earnestly>	how often do you do that?
<earnestly>	once every 8 years?
<bougyman>	and you need checkpoints and user intervention sometimes.
<rena>	i wonder if given the rampant piracy in some countries, they're planning to move to a system where windows is free and they just sell services like cloud storage
<bougyman>	the user should know about that.
<d_garbage>	and since they're lumbered with eternal backwards compatibility anyway, the number releases seem mostly like just marketing
<lambdacomplex>	moving /bin/?
<earnestly>	yes, i expect user intervention
<earnestly>	!give lambdacomplex usrmerge
<phrik>	lambdacomplex: https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2012-march/022625.html
<rena>	i think most people don't pay for windows explicitly anyway, it just comes with their pc
<bougyman>	i'm just proposing you tell the user before it breaks, instead of after.
<earnestly>	bougyman: i'm an idealist
<bougyman>	(not via mailing list, via the os itself)
<rena>	(and also they want to get everyone on the new platform so they can push ads :p)
<bougyman>	update the to safest non-breaking version as a fallback.
<earnestly>	bougyman: yeah, i'd do all those things if i was ubuntu and probably automate most of them
<bougyman>	this is not too complex.
<d_garbage>	up next: subscription model
<coolthingy500>	i think windows is going with the rolling release.
<earnestly>	that's not a bad idea if they want to make some money to support it, d_garbage
<earnestly>	like patreon, a nice model
<bougyman>	of course, you have to have snapshots of the checkpoints.
<bougyman>	it's why i started archiving our repos
<d_garbage>	sure
<d_garbage>	windows is way too expensive to buy (unless you're buying new hardware maybe)
<earnestly>	the only reason i can see for checkpoints is when something goes wrong and you don't have the skill or time to fix it right there and then
<d_garbage>	but renting it for a fraction of that is much more attractive
<earnestly>	bad kernels?  downgrade, trivial
<sheep>	how can i get an interface to re-request an ipv6 router advertisement?
<earnestly>	large changes are so infrequent
<earnestly>	and usually go very smoothly
<coolthingy500>	speaking of which. if a update in win borks their system. i don't think users can downgrade packages.
<d_garbage>	well then they'll fix it so they can
<rafa652>	it depends - some windows updates can be uninstalled
<rafa652>	but that's just it, only some
<earnestly>	coolthingy500: windows will do very crazy things to make the whole thing pretty transparent
<d_garbage>	of course
<earnestly>	they have the manpower, skill and money to pull off something like that with pure brute force
<earnestly>	people like bougyman need to depend more on clever tech :p
<d_garbage>	it's actually the most positive idea i've heard out of them for years. good luck to them
<coolthingy500>	while shafting their consumers. thanks heavens you can opt out of that nonsense.
<rena>	sheep: as root: dhclient -r; dhclient
<d_garbage>	meh
<earnestly>	d_garbage: they're also considering open source
<d_garbage>	great
<earnestly>	d_garbage: because windows is pretty dead for servers
<earnestly>	and they know it
<rafa652>	ah, found it
<earnestly>	one of the fellows of microsft essentially said that and said open source was not an impossibility
<rafa652>	http://i.imgur.com/linsv4h.png
<earnestly>	(you have to be pretty epic to be a fellow)
<earnestly>	rafa652: you can also host windows updates locally
<earnestly>	have your own update server
<earnestly>	wsus
<earnestly>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/windows_server_update_services
<phrik>	title: windows server update services - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (at en.wikipedia.org)
<rafa652>	ah yeah i've heard of it, just responding to someone above showing that some updates can be uninstalled
<d_garbage>	http://oi39.tinypic.com/9rk1lc.jpg
<rafa652>	i don't run a windows server myself or know much about running one, always just used them in workstations
<coolthingy500>	an update on win 7 broke my os 3 times. i got pissed and installed whatever distro i thought was good at the time.
<netz>	heh. my intro to linux was much more mundain. i built a crap pc from salvaged parts that couldn't run win7, so i looked into other stuff :)
<netz>	ended up with ubuntu lucid, never looked back :)
<d_garbage>	i started using linux quite simply because windows was so hideously expensive
<d_garbage>	if i could have afforded it i might never have
<earnestly>	i used it because i accidently my windows
<d_garbage>	heh
<earnestly>	figured i was going to reinstall it, so i might as well screw around in linux and see how long it takes to break
<earnestly>	"run all the commands on the internet!"
<coolthingy500>	my sister laptop is a shitty acer with win 7. she thought my asus is shitty because it's a older machine
<rena>	i was annoyed with a lot of minor bugs in xp, didn't want to be stuck with an obsolete os, definitely wasn't gonna move to vista
<coolthingy500>	ha. my dads got vista. i don't know how he tolreates it.
<rena>	even 7 drives me nuts, i can't imagine being stuck on vista
<rafa652>	dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda
<rafa652>	broken in record time
<rena>	dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/kmem bs=1 count=1 seek=$random
<dynamicmetaflow>	so um please excuse my newbieness but i am learning. so i disabled the dhcpd wireless service and now i am herehttp://campl.us/ez7olahpgxk

<rafa652>	oh that's really nice
<rena>	make a game, see how many times you can do it before panic
<rena>	sneak it into startup script
<d_garbage>	someone kindly gave me an old pc but os was broken, i knew zero about pc's and bought a copy of xp at a market stall for £5. i remember thinking, wow that's quite cheep and remember the odd look i got when i asked the guy, "this is legal, right?" bought it anyway and decided it best not to think to closely about it :)
<d_garbage>	meh not xp win 98
<d_garbage>	long time ago
<earnestly>	d_garbage: i've never used a legal copy of windows
<rena>	yeah all legit xp disks are labelled in sharpie with a handwritten serial number
<earnestly>	and i probably never will
<d_garbage>	i'd be curious about any kind of 'pay as you go' time system
<dynamicmetaflow>	i remember my science teacher from middle school gave me and old school pic of 233 mhz running an energy bios i replaced the bios and it worked
<d_garbage>	type*
<dynamicmetaflow>	i replaced the power supply i mean
<d_garbage>	mostly for games
<aelius>	i want to map a scancode to the keycode of f30 (dvtm apparently doesn't respond to keysyms). since i don't actually have an f30, i don't know how to get the keycode
<earnestly>	d_garbage: i'd prefer "try before you buy" ;p
<aelius>	how would i find it?
<dynamicmetaflow>	anyone remember shareware?
<d_garbage>	otherwise *shrug* linux/arch does absolutely everything i need it to
<earnestly>	d_garbage: i download them, if i play through the entire thing, i buy it
<d_garbage>	good idea
<earnestly>	d_garbage: or in the case of gog, i just bought a load of crap because yay gog and drm free
<d_garbage>	it usually makes me smile when people rant about microsoft because i don't have to use it and it's been pretty much irrelevant to me for years
<earnestly>	and having a load of neat executables to have
<toqoz>	for a company pushing linux steams client is terrible for linux
<d_garbage>	yeah, gog for the win
<earnestly>	toqoz: steam for linux only exists because of microsoft's appstore
<pablotron>	yo yo
<earnestly>	but i think valve has caught a bit of the open source bug after having such a positive experience with the intel driver guys.
<toqoz>	earnestly: explain?
<d_garbage>	pablotron, skipping rope
<earnestly>	toqoz: microsoft' appstore was threat to steam
<aelius>	heh
<aelius>	not really
<earnestly>	so they wanted an alternative to windows
<earnestly>	aelius: didn't turn out to be in the end
<d_garbage>	oh yeah, i remember that, about the time win8 was failing hard too
<lambdacomplex>	earnestly: didn't they find that source ran better on opengl than directx even though it was written for directx?
<aelius>	"a potential competitor" is all it ever was
<earnestly>	steam is already a monopoly
<aelius>	and gaben threw a hissy fit over the idea of not being a complete monopoly
<earnestly>	lambdacomplex: source had both an opengl and directx backend
<earnestly>	lambdacomplex: and yes, opengl is more powerful, slightly
<toqoz>	i just wish the ui didnt always break/go slow
<toqoz>	i suppose they want big picture to be the linux thing though
<earnestly>	lambdacomplex: but they were happier with the fact they could actually see the driver code, it wasn't a black box
<lambdacomplex>	earnestly: that's certainly understandable
<earnestly>	and could actually be like real computer scientists and measure and see bottlenecks
<earnestly>	instead of just guessing and see what the blackbox spits out
<d_garbage>	doom3 is still a great example of a 'linux' game, even now :)
<dynamicmetaflow>	so yeah break time
<d_garbage>	i played it the other day, forgot how much fun it was
<toqoz>	is glnext still a thing?
<earnestly>	toqoz: it's called vulkan, and yes
<earnestly>	it is a thing
<earnestly>	mostly built on top of mantle, as amd basically donated it to khronos as a basis
<demtrizzle>	i just restored my kingston gt102 16gb pendrive on some windows machine with some windows utility. the utility repaired it and formated it in fat32. when i plug it in my archlinux box i see it being picked up in dmesg|tail, and lsusb shows the device but it gets no /dev file so i can't mount it
<pablotron>	so
<demtrizzle>	what can i do in order to access it?
<pablotron>	what linux games do you all play then?
<earnestly>	it will support basically any card that can do gles 3.3 iirc
<toqoz>	will it become a standard like opengl, do you think?
<earnestly>	valve already has an intel driver for it
<earnestly>	toqoz: it is
<zeevo>	i don't play video games
<earnestly>	toqoz: a standard, where have you been?
<aelius>	anyway, do keys that don't exist on the keyborad (like f30) have a keycode? i want to map my appskey/menukey scancode to the f30 keycode, if at all possible. but since i don't have an f30 key i don't know how to find the keycode
<toqoz>	earnestly: no game uses vulkan yet that ive seen
<earnestly>	toqoz: source2 uses it
<earnestly>	toqoz: but, no, none that you will see
<d_garbage>	currently playing vampire masquerade: bloodlines for the umpteenth time in wine :)
<earnestly>	toqoz: that's because a standard doesn't mean instant-video-games
<pablotron>	lol
<earnestly>	toqoz: but they have dota 2 running on vulkan
<pablotron>	never used wine
<hund>	not a linux game per ce, but i play modded minecraft.
<earnestly>	toqoz: it's still new
<pablotron>	i made this joke the other day though
<pablotron>	linux users are like jesus, they turn windows into wine
<earnestly>	toqoz: see the conference videos on youtube
<toqoz>	earnestly: i just meant, do you think that opengl will become obselete for gaming in comparison
<earnestly>	toqoz: yes
<coolthingy500>	i didn't know you can play  vampire masquerade: bloodlines on wine. i had win7 because of that game
<earnestly>	toqoz: as will dx < 12
<kennae>	there was a time i wished opengl would conquer but not so sure anymore
<earnestly>	toqoz: because the new apis are much, much better designed for the hardware
<d_garbage>	wine is pretty good these days (with the major exception of the insanely annoying file association/mime stuff it does)
<earnestly>	toqoz: see this specific post: http://www.gamedev.net/topic/666419-what-are-your-opinions-on-dx12vulkanmantle/#entry5215019
<phrik>	title: what are your opinions on dx12/vulkan/mantle? - graphics programming and theory - gamedev.net (at www.gamedev.net)
<toqoz>	earnestly: unfortunately that wasnt the case with a lot of dx11
<d_garbage>	really wish they'd stop doing that
<toqoz>	earnestly: alright ill take a look
<coolthingy500>	i stayed away from wine. unless it's on a machine i don't care for.
<earnestly>	wine is great
<pablotron>	i have windows installed on a 80gb laptop drive lol
<d_garbage>	it's come a long, long way
<pablotron>	it just hangs in my tower
<earnestly>	you can play most things on it, if the thing has an opengl backend, then great, if not, then eeeh.  it's a fair bit slower
<earnestly>	older games do better than windows itself
<earnestly>	lots of the hacks for windows game, like the ddraw stuff, is wine libraries
<ausseh>	i realize this question doesn't belong here, but in google chrome, how do i re-enable magnet links?
<earnestly>	!give ausseh chromeis
<phrik>	ausseh: chrome is the google branded release of the open source project chromium. the only difference is branding and a few extra proprietary extensions (which work just fine in chromium). you want extra/chromium.
<ausseh>	chromium>chrome?
<earnestly>	read it again, i guess
<d_garbage>	heh, it's the same see above
<ausseh>	so my normal extensions will download/sync when i download chromium?
<ausseh>	as well as themes?
<hund>	yes
<earnestly>	coolthingy500: e.g. their dib engine is opengl accelerated now, stuff like abes exoddus uses the dib engine, and fallout 2 iirc
<coolthingy500>	earnestly, that's great. something to look forward too later on.
<pablotron>	sweet abe
<ausseh>	>:| i feel as though everyone enjoys making fun of the less-educated with linux.
<d_garbage>	it's not really true and the feeling will pass
<d_garbage>	you're probably just suffering from new information overload
<ausseh>	could be... i use my macbook air, but never used anything in the command line, really... other than the dd command for the raspberry pi (form of debian, right?) and didn't really do anything with it except follow a tutorial.
<d_garbage>	well, everyone started sometime
<ausseh>	that's very true.
<d_garbage>	keep your irc log - a year from now you'll look back and smile
<demtrizzle>	is there a standard /include directory in arch?
<d_garbage>	i think it was about 6 months before i realised i was in booting to linux more than windows and i was no longer getting frustrated all the time at not knowing how to do seemingly simple things i knew how to do in windows
<netz>	demtrizzle: /usr/include
<toqoz>	until you get used to linux everything feels slower rather than faster
<d_garbage>	mind you linux os's get easier all the time, it wasn't quite so polished 6-7 years ago
<netz>	yep
<toqoz>	it also depends what distro you use to an extent
<toqoz>	when i used eos chrome would take upwards of a minute to start
<netz>	indeed. making *.deb packages is a bitch.
<netz>	pkgbuild <3
<niel>	does anyone know why nginx is not listing the directory of /files http://puu.sh/hixdr/7337086e9d.png
<d_garbage>	i've not been at it that long but certainly ubuntu wasn't really a thing at the time
<pablotron>	hexchat is randomly highlighting shit
<d_garbage>	wow that makes it more like 8-9 years then, my how time flies
<d_garbage>	pablotron, really?

<hund>	feature
<tigrmesh>	pablotron, i've had a lot of problems with hexchat
<netz>	i used to, now i use weechat :)
<tigrmesh>	you are not the only one
<pablotron>	i fixed it
<tigrmesh>	how?
<dynamicmetaflow>	hello everyone
<pablotron>	i had a space in the extra highlight thing
<tigrmesh>	hello dynamicmetaflow
<dynamicmetaflow>	i just wanted to say thank you to everyone who was helping me earlier
<tigrmesh>	ahh
<pablotron>	"paul, pablo"
<dynamicmetaflow>	i managed to fix the problem
<lambdacomplex>	dynamicmetaflow: what was wrong?
<jeromelanteri>	what is the equivalent command for update initramfs (like: "update-initramfs -u" with mkinitcpio ?
<lyonsb>	!give jeromelanteri wiki mkinitcpio
<phrik>	jeromelanteri: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/mkinitcpio
<jeromelanteri>	i'm on it allready, but i not find...
<jeromelanteri>	same in the man pages...
<dynamicmetaflow>	well i removed dhcpcd@networkservice.conf for both my wireless and ethernet then i went to etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants and found the syslink and removed it from there
<lyonsb>	jeromelanteri, technically, they do different things.
<dynamicmetaflow>	basically remove any reference to dhcpcd network service and also disabled dhcpd
<dynamicmetaflow>	then somehow reinstalled sddm and everything worked
<d_garbage>	jeromelanteri, https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/mkinitcpio#image_creation_and_activation
<phrik>	title: mkinitcpio - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<lyonsb>	^ much more helpful :)
<dynamicmetaflow>	post #2 on this link helpmed me out https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=163957
<phrik>	title: [solved] boot up hangs on this message "a start job is running for ... / newbie corner / arch linux forums (at bbs.archlinux.org)
<d_garbage>	lyonsb, i was pointing to the exact place. english is not their first language
<jeromelanteri>	d_garbage: this is for create images, but hos to update (in fact, how to do the same thinks than can do before with initramfs by update-initramfs -u") ?
<dynamicmetaflow>	thanks d_garbage lambdacomplex
<dynamicmetaflow>	and everyone
<d_garbage>	jeromelanteri, how is 'update' different from 'create'?
<dynamicmetaflow>	i have a silly question i am new to arch but is there a way i can test the stability of my system?
<dynamicmetaflow>	i just want to see if i have covered all my bases
<jeromelanteri>	update change... create is for create. but is your question is for point me that for update, i need to create a new one ?
<d_garbage>	jeromelanteri, as far as i know? i don't use it much (at all)
<lyonsb>	d_garbage, so if i understand this wikipage correctly, i could have a nas slug with (smtg semi-absurd) 4 ssd's and nfsroot=<the nas slug shares> . . . does that mean i could load just a a local kernel onto local /boot and have every system set up to use local kernel, but nfsroot=<shares> using the same version . . .
<d_garbage>	dynamicmetaflow, sorry i have pm's turned off, can't read them
<jeromelanteri>	d_garbage: ok. i follow my investigations for be sure
<dynamicmetaflow>	i was just saying thanks thats all
<d_garbage>	lyonsb, erm, sure that was meant for me? because i don't have a clue about any of that :)
<d_garbage>	dynamicmetaflow, you're welcome! :)
<lyonsb>	d_garbage, erm, sry, that's general, not . . .
<lyonsb>	d_garbage, for you per se.
<lyonsb>	i should prob. just try it anyway or something.
<d_garbage>	nas slug sounds like a gardening problem :)
<lyonsb>	it totally does.
<lyonsb>	totally sodium sulpher slugs.
<dynamicmetaflow>	so anyone any reccomendations to test stability once you install arch
<d_garbage>	use it?
<dynamicmetaflow>	or somewhere in the wiki i should look for
<dynamicmetaflow>	lol
<dynamicmetaflow>	good point
<jeromelanteri>	in the wiki, i read that for arch linux, initramfs image is "linux", but in fact, when i "ls" my /boot directroy, i can see there is no "linux.img" file, but "initramfs-linux.img" (and some others). what i have to understand ? it's really confuse for me.
<jeromelanteri>	dynamicmetaflow: test with a virtual machine maybe ?
<demtrizzle>	ok i'm unable to access my usb storage. following this: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/usb_storage_devices - i came to realize that my kernel doesnt have these modules loaded "usb_storage and sd_mod", but they aren't even available for loading
<phrik>	title: usb storage devices - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<tigrmesh>	jeromelanteri, the package is linux
<d_garbage>	"by default, the mkinitcpio script generates two images after kernel installation or upgrades: /boot/initramfs-linux.img and /boot/initramfs-linux-fallback.img."
<tigrmesh>	jeromelanteri, it used to be called kernel, but now it's called linux
<dynamicmetaflow>	jeromelanteri, you mean reinstall arch on a virtual machine and do a comparison?
<jeromelanteri>	tigrmesh: thanks. but if i do "mkinitcpio -g linux", does it create a initramfs-linux.img or does it create a linux.img ?
<jeromelanteri>	dynamicmetaflow: if you want to test it... why not ?
<dacoit>	-p . -g is to specify a path outside of the 'linux' preset
<aqlx86>	meta2-18~ /window -1
<demtrizzle>	it's funny i just made a full system upgrade and went from 3.19.3 to 4.0.1 but i haven't rebooted or anything. so uname -r outputs 3.19.3-1, but pacman -q|grep linux shows it at 4.0.1-1
<dynamicmetaflow>	jeromelanteri, i could do that i guess
<jeromelanteri>	(sorry... correction: "mkinitcpio -p linux...)
<toqoz>	jeromelante: i think he already has arch installed, and wants to test the stability of his current os
<dynamicmetaflow>	i just thought there may be some tool that i am not using that already does this
<dynamicmetaflow>	toqoz, correct
<tigrmesh>	jeromelanteri, why does that matter?  it will use the name it has preset.  and that's the name you've got set up in your bootloader
<dacoit>	demtrizzle: thats normal, and kernel upgrades are the only events that require a reboot (usually) also, pacman -qs to search :p
<jeromelanteri>	tigrmesh: the fact is i not setup myself, it is the automation of the insatllation process who does it itself. so now, i just try to well understand before do something. so... it is really confuse in sens of: what's will be happen really ? what can nderstand ? mkinitcpio -p linux will do a linux.img or a initramfs-linux.img ? the wiki is not precise on this point.
<toqoz>	dynamicmeta: i don't think there's really a specific 'way' other than just using it, maybe leave it on for a few days?  or reboot a few times.
<jasonwryan>	jeromelanteri: man mkinitcpio
<d_garbage>	demtrizzle, the kernel is loaded into memory at boot time. you just changed the version on the hard drive
<jasonwryan>	you'll work it out…
<d_garbage>	demtrizzle, importantly you also changed the kernel modules, so if you now try to load one it wont match the kernel running in memory
<dynamicmetaflow>	toqoz, thanks
<demtrizzle>	d_garbage, i know i just think it's a funny situation :) because i'm trying to load some modules but /lib/modules/`uname -r`/ doesn't exist anymore
<demtrizzle>	d_garbage, indeedz
<d_garbage>	demtrizzle, exactly
<d_garbage>	demtrizzle, but any modules already loaded will continue to work
<d_garbage>	catches a lot of people out, that
<jeromelanteri>	jasonwryan: the man page not give more precission around this. and the wiki make me confused by not bo to much precise on this moint.
<d_garbage>	!give demtrizzle kernelupdate
<phrik>	demtrizzle: http://i.imgur.com/6dbww.png
<d_garbage>	:)
<lyonsb>	i'm fiarly sure that the difference between linux.img and linux-initramfs.img is only in the name.
<jasonwryan>	jeromelanteri: yes, the man page does. further, mkinitcpio is a bash script: read that
<jeromelanteri>	but ok, if you don't really know (i think you don't, i you know you jaust have to tell...), i have to search more alone, for sure.
<lyonsb>	although possibly also compression method.
<lyonsb>	jeromelanteri, linux.img might == linux-initramfs.img
<lyonsb>	jeromelanteri, just named differently.
<demtrizzle>	so unfortunate... i don't do full system upgrades very often (though i should), and today that i have done it, me happens to need some modules :[
<d_garbage>	lyonsb, linux.img is the kernel, linux-initramfs.img is, amazingly, the initramfs image. nb this is not really the same thing :)
<d_garbage>	vmlinuz-linux*
<jeromelanteri>	lyonsb: ok. so i try it and command "mkinitcpio -p linux" create the image initramf-linux.img on /boot by the way the man page tell (default /etc/modprobe.d/ all files .conf). i think if the wiki tell it it would be not so much confused for people who don't know allready.
<dynamicmetaflow>	ok i am rebooting my system
<d_garbage>	good luck!
<dynamicmetaflow>	if i dont make it back soon
<dynamicmetaflow>	you know what happpened
<d_garbage>	hehe
<toqoz>	dynamicmeta: good luck
<dynamicmetaflow>	adios amigos hope be back
<jeromelanteri>	and it is many times like that... looks like you have to know precisions allready before to learn... so, sure, know and teach is really different as soon as teach is a specific job.
<d_garbage>	oh indeed yes
<d_garbage>	teaching is a bugger
<jeromelanteri>	d_garbage: you never go to school ?
<toqoz>	lol
<jeromelanteri>	lol
<d_garbage>	i think so, it's so long ago now it's hard to remember
<d_garbage>	i remember a young person with my name did all that stuff, sometimes hard to believe it was me
<jeromelanteri>	d_garbage: you are lucky that many teachers before teach you to read, write and calcul i think... theu make you like a more free people in this world.
<diegoviola>	i'll get a new thinkpad soon which has an ssd with windows, i want to wipe windows from that and just install arch on it
<phreakachu>	\o/
<wildefyr>	cool
<diegoviola>	should i just wipe the partition and format it?
<diegoviola>	or dd if=/dev/zero first?
<dynamicmetaflow>	hello world!
<diegoviola>	i don't want any traces of the old system on my ssd
<dacoit>	just make a new partition
<wildefyr>	diegoviola: just use fdisk on the arch iso
<gog>	if it's gpt you'll have to use gdisk and the 'o' command
<phreakachu>	if you are using encryption you should fill the drive with random crypted bytes first
<dacoit>	if=/dev/zero nonsense is a waste of time
<phreakachu>	otherwise there's no point
<gog>	otherwise it'll leave traces
<gog>	and confuse the hell out of gdisk
<d_garbage>	jeromelanteri, teachers are handy but i seem to remember mostly learning myself *shrug*
<jeromelanteri>	an other technical question. i have my ssd ocz vertex2 who sometimes as been see by the os, sometimes not (half time). what could be the problem ?
<diegoviola>	gog: what will leave traces?
<lyonsb>	diegoviola, you might prefer to use if=/dev/urandom if encryption is your plan.
<gog>	gpt entries are at the beginning and end of the disk
<gog>	the end is a backup copy
<diegoviola>	i'm also concerned, this thinkpad seems to ship with a internal battery, i never seen other laptops do that, that's probably a topic for ##hardware anyway
<gog>	if they don't match then gdisk will complain
<gog>	and sometimes the gpt driver in linux does weird things
<rafa652>	won't matter using urandom on an ssd if trim's going to be used on it too
<gog>	and some firmwares might not like it
<gog>	i know mine was a pain in the ass until i fixed it
<jeromelanteri>	d_garbage: you are the best... very good. but you are probably to push in the case: "exception" on this big world. but many think about themself they are the best to... and this is not an exception. so, humility is someting really difficult for human (and can not be teach at school, for sure).
<reactormonk>	any official package which contains latex beamer?
<jakedust>	diegoviola: dd'ing an entire ssd doesn't sound very good for its life
<gog>	also that
<diegoviola>	jakedust: right
<d_garbage>	jeromelanteri, i was as old as you could be and still be in that 'year' so i was kind of ahead all the time and the teaches spent most of their time with the others, besides i enjoy reading
<diegoviola>	i'll just create the partition/format and install as usual
<jeromelanteri>	d_garbage: i know it, you help many times.
<d_garbage>	me? thanks, i don't do much relly though
<d_garbage>	really*
<dacoit>	his humbleness will be his undoing some day.
<dynamicmetaflow>	anyone running plasma?
<jakedust>	d_garbage: you are one of the nicks i still recognize from this channel, so you probably have spent a reasonable amount of the last 5~8 years here =p
<jeromelanteri>	d_garbage: my thinking is that community could be something really good by the help we can provide to. if not, there is no sens of community in fact.
<jeromelanteri>	dynamicmetaflow: yes
<d_garbage>	me? pff! i've no time for 'humble' just being realistic. sometimes people get an impression that isn't really true and that can work both ways.
<jeromelanteri>	d_garbage: humility is realist way of thinking to.
<dynamicmetaflow>	i love contributing, i'm actually a community organizer, labor rights and trying to go back to school to bridge the gaps in the social progressive movement with technology
<d_garbage>	!shrug3
<phrik>	┐(ツ)┌
<toqoz>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<dacoit>	heehee my favorite shrug
<dynamicmetaflow>	there are alot of people that are unaware when it comes to technology so sharing the knowledge is important
<toqoz>	damn, your one looks better
<jeromelanteri>	dynamicmetaflow: 100% ok with you.
<phreakachu>	dd'ing a whole ssd once won't noticeably affect the lifetime
<phreakachu>	the lifetime of ssds these days is so good that it's better than magnetic drives anyway
<jeromelanteri>	what i can do for try to understand (test) why my ssd ocz vertex2 is sometimes see by ls/dev, sometimes not ? (all the time see by the bios)
<dynamicmetaflow>	any where for kdewallet to be silent
<lbv_user>	dynamicmetaflow: you can always disable it
<dynamicmetaflow>	i don't want to be inserting my passwords for my networks and chromium everytime i open/boot
<jeromelanteri>	dynamicmetaflow: what's happen with plasma ?
<dynamicmetaflow>	is that recommended?
<toqoz>	jeromelante: if you can rule out a different sata port?
<lbv_user>	dynamicmetaflow: if you dont use, you can disable
<lbv_user>	dynamicmetaflow: the same guy who got into indexing didn't put his figers in kwallet, so you can still disable :d
<dynamicmetaflow>	ok, i'll do that any side effects?
<lbv_user>	dynamicmetaflow: some services may not store you passwords (like kmail) and some may store them as plain text
<dynamicmetaflow>	that's fine i don't even use kmail
<jeromelanteri>	toqoz: i try it allready: same result. also, i see there is on my mother board an option for storage type: "hdd / ssd" but choose ssd will never see it more. i post on asrock forum, but i wait for an answer to...
<dynamicmetaflow>	i actually need to review the apps i do have installed
<dynamicmetaflow>	anyone if i could use pacman with the -q command to generate html with the appss installed and a description?
<lbv_user>	dynamicmetaflow: system settings -> account details -> kde wallet
<jeromelanteri>	dynamicmetaflow: for my own experience, it sucks on the system and it is just something not necessary to use.
<dynamicmetaflow>	yeah i was so confused
<dynamicmetaflow>	when i first saw it boot up
<toqoz>	jeromelante: does it happen with something like a livecd?
<jeromelanteri>	dynamicmetaflow: you can instal pacmanxg (gui of pacman) and you have more confort to view all.
<dynamicmetaflow>	installing arch over this weekend felt like if i was disassembling a computer and making components talk to each other. challenging and fun
<jeromelanteri>	toqoz: no, ma archlinux is not from live.
<dynamicmetaflow>	jeromelanteri, thnak you
<jeromelanteri>	dynamicmetaflow: you are welcome (each time i can help, my ego like it... lol)
<toqoz>	jeromelante: i mean, have you tried using a livecd, to see if the problem still occurs?
<dynamicmetaflow>	i don't see it under account details hmm
<jeromelanteri>	toqoz: ok, good idea, i wil try it this day. thanks for this idea.
<dynamicmetaflow>	jeromelanteri, you don't happen to live in ma would you?
<jeromelanteri>	what is ma ?
<dynamicmetaflow>	i'd buy you a beer and food for your tummy
<dynamicmetaflow>	massachusetts
<toqoz>	you might be able to rule out the os, but maybe it's just an obscure drive...
<jeromelanteri>	no i live in thailand.
<dynamicmetaflow>	ah ok
<jeromelanteri>	dynamicmetaflow: if you come here, i'm on north (near laos), and tell me that at this time, you will be welcome.
<pablotron>	back on win 8
<jeromelanteri>	toqoz: i would like to understand if it could be my drive or my mother board who is "bad".
<pablotron>	no its motherboard day
<jeromelanteri>	pablotron: sorry ?
<dynamicmetaflow>	well if i am ever there ill remember
<pablotron>	it's mother's day in the us
<jeromelanteri>	pablotron: so, happy mother's day for all american mums.
<jeromelanteri>	lol
<jeromelanteri>	pablotron: what's the principe of motherboard day ?
<jeromelanteri>	you have to buy one ?
<pablotron>	i dunno i was joking
<pablotron>	cause you said it might be bad
<sudokode>	so much green
<sudokode>	that's not a euphemism
<jeromelanteri>	i don't know if mine is bugged or not. i'm on an asrock extrem 6 z97... so it could be the drive also...
<sudokode>	http://a.pomf.se/ykwifk.png
<jeromelanteri>	but i suspect the mother board as soon as she as the reputation to be bugged...
<sudokode>	what, asrock?
<sudokode>	ofc
<jeromelanteri>	yes
<jakedust>	phreakachu: i thought ssd's sectors had a really small number of reasonably allowed writes, due to amplification
<jeromelanteri>	also support of asmedia is not the best one support...
<sudokode>	asrock is basically like if an ostrich decided to make a motherboard, but first it had to get funding through a neonazi camel named clyde
<tigrmesh>	hah!
<jeromelanteri>	sudokode: is it a joke ?
<sudokode>	as unlikely a scenario as that is, it happened
<dynamicmetaflow>	`so kwallet is a pain to disable
<sudokode>	jeromelanteri: almost
<dynamicmetaflow>	its not under account details and through pacman requires all these dependencies of other things
<jeromelanteri>	wich mother board mark could be the best one and well supported by linux system ?
<sudokode>	oh it's not a matter of linux support
<sudokode>	i just hate asrock in general
<jakedust>	sudokode: i wish irssi uses a different coloring algorithm ;)
<jeromelanteri>	sudokode: maybe there is great reason of that. but i just want to know which mark is strong and good
<sudokode>	i prefer asus
<ac_slater>	hey guys. i apparently dont have some man pages for the glibc specific features. any clue how to get those? i searched the package database and nothing stands out
<tom^>	sudokode!
<sudokode>	tom^!
<sudokode>	did you watch got?
<sudokode>	!give tom^ yt are you gonna be my girl
<phrik>	tom^: jet - are you gonna be my girl - youtube: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuk6n2lkza0>
<phreakachu>	jakedust, yeah, we're talking millions of writes
<tom^>	sudokode: it releases 4 in the morning here
<tom^>	sudokode: so no :p
<sudokode>	dumb
<sudokode>	move to america
<tom^>	sudokode: increase your taxes with ~25% and i might
<tom^>	did the redhead ressurect sean bean with her boobs?
<escondida>	ac_slater: got [core]/man-pages
<escondida>	?
<ac_slater>	escondida: of course ;)
<dynamicmetaflow>	anyone has any recommendations with the touchpad i have a synaptics one
<ac_slater>	escondida: specifically dont have the gnu only features of things like pthreads_rwlock\
<sudokode>	tom^: no not yet
<dynamicmetaflow>	i installed it before and it was picked up under settings
<dynamicmetaflow>	it still works but a red bar says "no touchpad found"
<dynamicmetaflow>	sometimes it makes scrolling difficult with two fingers where i have to alt tab because it somewhat freezes
<dynamicmetaflow>	kinda weird
<escondida>	ac_slater: if you have glibc, you should have a *lot* of manpages whose names are prefixed with pthreads_rwlock, but none just called pthreads_rwlock
<escondida>	ac_slater: apropos pthreads_rwlock
<ac_slater>	escondida: right - i do and i do know about about apropos. but i cant find any docs for pthread_rwlock_writer_nonrecursive_initializer_np
<ac_slater>	escondida: reading the sources of glibc, i can see what they do ... but damn, no docs
<s00pcan>	i just tried vim -y for the first time
<ac_slater>	s00pcan: works fine until you forgot to supply a filename on the command line and you have to do control-l to get the command line
<ac_slater>	i mean, it could be worse
<ac_slater>	you probably have an alias for it `evim`
<s00pcan>	ac_slater: how was i supposed to know it was ctrl-l? :( i saw it had used my colorscheme, but little else of my settings.  i had to go to the menu
<s00pcan>	but yeah, i was fine until i tried saving, no input() to get a filename?
<ac_slater>	s00pcan: i wish i could help. i just googled it once. i was helping a friend get into vim - i gave up and made him use something else
<jakedust>	earnestly]
<s00pcan>	ac_slater: i've used vim since 2009 and have never touched ezmode until now, probably a good thing
<thaweatherman>	i cant get brightness controls to work with sxhkd
<ac_slater>	s00pcan: yea prob
<ac_slater>	s00pcan: it's good for getting people into vim ... but really, it has no value.
<thaweatherman>	i believe the special key name is xf86monbrightnessup
<thaweatherman>	and then down
<thaweatherman>	so i added in the keybindings to sxhkdrc and reloaded, but pressing the keys does nothing
<ac_slater>	thaweatherman: you might need acpi support
<thaweatherman>	is there a package for that?
<ac_slater>	thaweatherman: just because some application sends a keypress doesnt mean your system is setup toi handle it
<ac_slater>	thaweatherman: depends if a) brightness works with your laptop at all b) you have acpi installed
<thaweatherman>	gnome seemed to know how to handle it and i just need to get sxhkd to do the same
<thaweatherman>	would gnome have acpi built in?
<ac_slater>	thaweatherman: you have to tweak the acpi handler script sometimes... should be on the wiki
<ac_slater>	thaweatherman: yea it would ...
<ac_slater>	hmm
<ac_slater>	i dont use gnome :( sorry bud
<thaweatherman>	im switching away from gnome
<st33med>	what's the kde terminal?
<st33med>	found it
<s00pcan>	ac_slater: feature discovery, graphical menus.  it could be useful to switch to this mode scripted for some reason
<ac_slater>	s00pcan: i think you're confusing easy mode with gvim
<ac_slater>	s00pcan: you can run easymode without a graphical interface
<s00pcan>	ok, i see the difference now.  i used gvim very early on, almost forgot about that
<thaweatherman>	ac_slater: i installed acpi but it seems to only give information about the battery and temperatures
<ac_slater>	thaweatherman: read the wiki, you should probably know what it is
<ac_slater>	thaweatherman: `acpi` the application is just that - a way to query acpi info
<ac_slater>	thaweatherman: don't confuse application with service or kernel modules
<thaweatherman>	yeah i am reading more about it
<thaweatherman>	i dont see a kernel module that stands out for screen control but i will keep looking
<thaweatherman>	thanks
<s00pcan>	gvim for me needs the cursor blink disabled and some way to hide the toolbar+menu
<ac_slater>	thaweatherman: sometimes you see one like `dell**` or `hpux***`
<s00pcan>	i'm doing this to test out vim --servername --remote and all that. gvim is launching with a server by default
<ac_slater>	s00pcan: help go
<ac_slater>	s00pcan:oops that's not it
<ac_slater>	you can hide that stuff
<ac_slater>	s00pcan: `help guioptions`
<s00pcan>	the toolbar and scrollbar were options in the edit->global_settings menu, but not the menu
<s00pcan>	set guioptions-=m
<avenita>	theres a way to get my wireless mouse (microsoft wireless 1000) to be assigned to /dev/input/js# (anything but /js0)? js0 is used for hdaps for print the accelerometer readings
<dynamicmetaflow>	one way to get a list from pacman of all installed packages and description is with
<dynamicmetaflow>	expac
<dynamicmetaflow>	expac -hm "%011m\t%-20n\t%10d" $( comm -23 <(pacman -qqen|sort) <(pacman -qqg base base-devel|sort) ) | sort -n  | curl -f 'sprunge=<-' sprunge.us
<s00pcan>	the argument-list is a dash separated, list of arguments like guicursor=n-v-c:block-cursor/lcursor,ve...
<s00pcan>	yeah so no way i'm doing that from the prompt
<ac_slater>	s00pcan: you can put that in .vimrc
<dynamicmetaflow>	good night all
<dynamicmetaflow>	catch everyone later
<s00pcan>	set guicursor+=a:blinkon0
<thaweatherman>	what is the fn key typically called in configs?
<thaweatherman>	i cant seem to find a name for it
<jushur>	fn
<thaweatherman>	so in something like sxhkd if i use fn in a key mapping it should know what i mean
<jushur>	no, almost no applications will be aware of your fn key
<thaweatherman>	yeah just tried it, didnt work
<thaweatherman>	fn + left arrow / right arrow do home/end and the system recognizes those
<jushur>	its a hardware extension key, basicly it will send extra keycodes when you use it. those you can map to whatever you want tho. unless they specific alrdy. like laptops usualy have the keypad numbers mapped such.
<thaweatherman>	what key does "hyper" refer to?
<abrarsyed>	has anyone ever gottene clipse to look decent with a dark gtk theme?
<holomorph>	!give thaweatherman w hyper key
<phrik>	thaweatherman: space-cadet keyboard - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/space-cadet_keyboard>
<thaweatherman>	thanks
<elocho>	hey just getting into arch this is my first install. i'm near the end but when i try grub-mkconfig i get this. any help appreciated.
<jushur>	abrarsyed: i use xfce with numix borders, xfce-flat color theme. and obsidian theme for all my coding. going to asume it would look nice on your side to.
<elocho>	http://pastebin.com/dvwvnxmw
<phrik>	title: grub-mkconfig -o /boot/frub/grub.cfg generating grub configuration file ... - pastebin.com (at pastebin.com)
<abrarsyed>	jushur, general coding is generally fine as far as colors.. but eclipse seems to hate any attempt at making it dark..
<s00pcan>	ok so the magic words were set guioptions-=mrlt for menu right scrollbar, left scrollbar, toolbar
<avenita>	lol, is posible to hook up those keyboards to a moderm system?
<abrarsyed>	gtk inconsitently darkens some areas, leaves others light, the only decent dark plugin (moonrise) makes eclipse takle 3 secodns to render after switching to it from another window etc
<avenita>
<jushur>	abrarsyed: im going to state that most apps are not designed or have good enough theme properties to handle a very dark palete. in general.
<jushur>	abrarsyed: make a own theme? copy the default, and change it untill it looks what you like.
<abrarsyed>	yeah, gues thats exactly what il have to do... eclipse and teamspeak need custom themes :(
<toqoz>	elocho: are you using a vm?
<fungle>	elocho: you have the output wrong? /boot/frub
<elocho>	no vm i typed that lol
<elocho>	i didn't make that mistake on the machine
<jushur>	!pastebin elocho
<toqoz>	are you allowed to link to websites other than arch wiki?
<elocho>	i'm installing it on my desktop
<diegoviola>	i'll be using a thinkpad t450 soon which has uefi, what is the process for upgrading the firmware on those machines? i won't have nor use windows
<diegoviola>	i recall on my t510 i would just copy the firmware on usb and flash that way, what is the process in uefi?
<jushur>	toqoz: if its ontopic, no advertising attempt.
<s00pcan>	i am just learning that vim options can't be used together with set -=
<toqoz>	elocho: have you rebooted yet?  it did say done…
<fungle>	diegoviola: i think lenovo should have instructions on upgrading firmware for non window oss on their site
<diegoviola>	fungle: ok thanks
<elocho>	yeah grub is there but then it drops down to a shell
<jushur>	diegoviola: most uefi bios has a very easy upgrade mechanic, and does not need a os to be installed.
<s00pcan>	set guioptions-=l guioptions-=t guioptions-=m guioptions-=r
<s00pcan>	really can't put them together
<diegoviola>	jushur: so you can upgrade from uefi itself?
<toqoz>	elocho: drops down to a shell?
<jushur>	diegoviola: go read their manual, it should have a step by step guide in it for this kind of thing. if not its not worth byuing..
<diegoviola>	jushur: will do, thanks
<elocho>	yeah after grub it says "starting version 219.....error device 'device name' not found skipping fsck error unable to find root device 'root device' . you are being dropped to a recovery shell
<theomurpse>	my (headless) system's arch linux won't boot. i can take the usb device that houses / and plug it into another computer. is there some boot log somewhere that i can read off the drive to try to diagnose the issue?
<fungle>	elocho: seems like your root partition is wrong
<elocho>	now that i think about it i'm guessing that dosn't have anything to do with my grub-mkconfig problem does it?
<elocho>	yeah
<fungle>	theomurpse: journalctl
<jushur>	elocho: so you used a lvm2 in your /etc/mkinitcpio.conf
<toqoz>	it probably does because its looking for the device and cant find it
<elocho>	yup
<theomurpse>	fungle awesome, i'll google it
<elocho>	mounted /dev/mapper/volumes-root to /mnt
<elocho>	boot to /mnt/boot and home to /mnt/home
<elocho>	then ran pacstrap
<elocho>	boot was ext4 and outside the crypt volume
<elocho>	however all volumes were in the extended volume
<jushur>	elocho: and you had a working lvmetad.service running when you made the grub.cfg ?
<elocho>	yup
<elocho>	i'll chew on this a little more and come back if it's still not working
<theomurpse>	ok here's the journalctl log - any idea what's going on? please note it's the 11th now and i plugged it in and tried to boot it up a few minutes ago. it looks like there's no new log to system.journal at all! sorry about it being an img instead of pastebin, but the box that is reading the drive is a guest vm, and shared clipboard isn't working for some reason. http://imgur.com/vrwvnaa
<phrik>	title: imgur (at imgur.com)
<theomurpse>	latest log there is may 8, which is i think when it stopped booting up.
<theomurpse>	or at least when i couldn't ssh in anymore. the led is indicating it's booted up.
<joshsyn>	anybody using source code pro font from adobe?
<fungle>	joshsyn: i've used it before
<sudokode>	joshsyn: no, consolas from microsoft
<joshsyn>	i am having issues setting is as lightweight in eclipse
<joshsyn>	its always going to regular size
<sudokode>	does it have a lightweight?
<joshsyn>	i meant extralight
<fungle>	theomurpse: seems like a critical service failed
<sudokode>	extra/adobe-source-code-pro-fonts       /usr/share/fonts/adobe-source-code-pro/sourcecodepro-extralight.otf
<sudokode>	hm yep
<joshsyn>	extralight, light regular, i don't know why eclipse only takes in regular even though i set it to extralight
<joshsyn>	other java application does not have this issue
<sudokode>	joshsyn: fc-query "source code pro extra light"
<sudokode>	er
<fungle>	joshsyn: i have a feeling this might have to do with your fontconfig
<sudokode>	fc-match
<joshsyn>	can't query face 0 of font file source code pro extra light
<joshsyn>	what does mean
<joshsyn>	with fc-match, it returned sourcecodepro-extralight.otf: "source code pro" "extralight"
<sudokode>	hm
<sudokode>	i can only blame eclipse then
<joshsyn>	yeah i think so too
<fungle>	joshsyn: yea i dont use eclipse, apologies, if you can eliminate that the problem is eclipse then you might want to check out your fontconfig setttings
<theomurpse>	fungle i'm about to load up the whole logfile somewhere and will paste it - might pare it down to the most recent bits because the whole file is 8mb.
<theomurpse>	thanks so far!
<fungle>	theomurpse: you can do something like journalctl -r --root=root
<kyusaki>	does anyone know of an skype-cli client of sort?
<sudokode>	theomurpse: journalctl --root=/mnt -b
<fungle>	where root is your mounted root
<sudokode>	if empty, -b -1
<sudokode>	assuming you mount your / to /mnt
<sudokode>	and ofc
<sudokode>	!sprunge
<phrik>	pipe or redirect your command or file into `curl -f 'sprunge=<-' sprunge.us`. this will upload to sprunge.us and return a link to the paste.
<fungle>	kyusaki: video chat in cli?
<sudokode>	kyusaki: no
<kyusaki>	fungle, no only the chat function
<sudokode>	you mean irc?
<sudokode>	welcome
<theomurpse>	sudokode, fungle you mean the root of the "failed" system's drive that i've got plugged in as an external drive to a working system right now, right?
<kyusaki>	haha
<theomurpse>	it's mounted at /media/ubuntu/someuuid and i tried journalctl --root=/media/ubuntu/someuuid and it's just giving me the log of the vm i'm in now, not the "failed" journalctl stuff
<sudokode>	actually, if you really want a chat/im replacement of skype, use xmpp
<sudokode>	it's open source and comes in many flavors
<kyusaki>	tox seems like an good choice
<grawity>	just without the users
<sudokode>	exactly
<sudokode>	which is why irc
<grawity>	theomurpse: journalctl -d /media/foo/bar/var/log/journal
<kyusaki>	though, my mom doesn't know how to use anything else than skype and facebook, and i do not enjoy logging into facebook ... >_>
<sudokode>	if your mom can use a keyboard, why can't she just text?
<kyusaki>	because it costs alot of money to send texts (not hella lot but still).
<kyusaki>	(we are not in the same country)
<sudokode>	yeah in 2002
<sudokode>	this is 2015
<sudokode>	oic
<sudokode>	ehhh
<sudokode>	there are internet-based messaging services that can simulate texting
<kyusaki>	like viber or whatsapp?
<sudokode>	sure
<fungle>	there's also google hangouts
<sudokode>	whatsapp is probably the only one i know of offhand cause i don't have a use for such things
<kyusaki>	yah
<fungle>	if you don't mind google
<sudokode>	wait i wonder...
<kyusaki>	google is okay for many things.
<kyusaki>	though it would be good if i could get my mom to use hangouts.
<sudokode>	yes. you can send texts via google voice
<kyusaki>	yeah and also have video chats through the hangouts client
<sudokode>	google voice is actually pretty fucking cool
<sudokode>	at least what you get for free is pretty cool
<thaweatherman>	anyone have a bash script for grabbing weather data from accuweather?
<fungle>	also works on linux
<thaweatherman>	sudokode: internation rates are significantly cheaper with gvoice
<thaweatherman>	international*
<theomurpse>	grawity, fungle, sudokode - any ideas? http://pastebin.com/e6xqzvjm this is the last few hours of the log, from may 7 10pm to may 8 3am. i had a few reboots in there because i was trying to configure fstab to auto-mount some external drives. one of the reboots it got this problem, and i've reverted fstab but it doesn't seem to have solved the problem. thanks.
<phrik>	title: may 07 22:12:45 alarm systemd[279]: starting timers. may 07 22:12:45 alarm syst - pastebin.com (at pastebin.com)
<thaweatherman>	at&t calling card is cheaper than on a plan. to samoa it is 77 cents with the card. using google voice it is 53 cents
<thaweatherman>	as an example
<sudokode>	thaweatherman: hm.. if you get a local number and your foreign friend gets a local number for you, wouldn't you avoid international rates?
<sudokode>	not sure how forwarding is counted in that regard
<thaweatherman>	that would be nice if it were possible
<sudokode>	probably have to pay for international forwarding
<sudokode>	heh
<thaweatherman>	the only country i call to is samoa and internet access is expensive and not practical there
<thaweatherman>	but voice still gives the cheapest rate
<thaweatherman>	which is awesome
<edit>	whats the zip code their
<sudokode>	yeah, google has an interesting model
<thaweatherman>	edit: in samoa?
<sudokode>	it's like walmart but for internet shit
<fungle>	thaweatherman: seems like something called sickbeard is failing
<sudokode>	buy in bulk, sell cheap, monopolize
<thaweatherman>	edit: american samoa is 96799 but i have no clue what samoa's is
<thaweatherman>	fungle: sickbeard?
<sudokode>	mostly vertical monopolization
<sudokode>	which keeps the government away sorta
<edit>	yeah
<fungle>	theomurpse: uhh a python app it seems
<theomurpse>	fungle, can you direct me to the line that makes you think that? i'd like to inspect around to see the context and try to learn as well. then i guess i'll disable it.
<grawity>	thaweatherman: so, from top to bottom, 29) sickbeard won't start because /media/original/logs/ is missing, 47) same for samba, 76) your dbus-daemon is dying with sigill (illegal cpu instruction), and 78) your sshd is crashing with sigsegv (segmentation fault)
<fungle>	theomurpse:  sick beard
<theomurpse>	thaweatherman, it's a reference to my log file, so no concern of yours ;)
<grawity>	theomurpse: actually ^
<grawity>	theomurpse: with references to lines and everything
<grawity>	theomurpse: the first two, you can fix with mkdir
<grawity>	theomurpse: the other two, you need to ask #archlinux-arm about.
<grawity>	not something we can help with here
<theomurpse>	grawity, ok cool. i figured at least for interpreting systemd, here would be fine. i'll proceed to there in just a second. so let's see, the first two are the missing log file (that's because /media/original is not auto-mounted - that's what i was trying to set up. so sick beard is trying to read the log file before original is mounted.
<grawity>	ah, yeah, there's more: 957) httpd won't start because /etc/httpd/modules/mod_authn_default.so is missing (note that /etc/httpd/modules is usually a symlink to /usr/lib/httpd/modules),
<theomurpse>	ah, that'd be the culprit since i can't ssh in but the leds on the system indicate it's booted!
<theomurpse>	well, i hope that's the culprit.
<arch-tk>	grawity: surely at this point it's far easier to say: "you must have seriously fucked up something at some point somewhere."
<theomurpse>	i wonder why in the world that is missing. i can't recall ever touching anything in that directory.
<theomurpse>	arch-tk, the weird thing is all i did between it working and not working was edit /etc/fstab
<theomurpse>	in fact, i only changed the auto-mount options to include mounting with acl in a non-root drive, which if not even plugged in, still the device won't let me ssh in.
<theomurpse>	so the realm of fuckuppery i might have committed is very small :)
<arch-tk>	have you tried undoing exactly what you did and retrying?
<grawity>	well, again, as i mentioned, your sshd is crashing with sigsegv and your dbus-daemon with sigill
<theomurpse>	arch-tk, yes, i totally cleared out fstab of all config and still i can't ssh in. that was what i tried before coming here.
<grawity>	so you can't ssh in because there's no sshd listening
<arch-tk>	theomurpse: incidentally, grawity mentioned arm, which arm device?
<theomurpse>	so if all this stuff (apache, ssh) isn't working, does it sound like a drive failure?
<theomurpse>	corrupted files?
<grawity>	and as mentioned, since you run alarm, this is very specifically an #archlinux-arm question
<grawity>	e.g. sigill might mean it was built for a more modern cpu than you have
<grawity>	(i.e. it's calling instructions your cpu does not recognize)
<arch-tk>	theomurpse: to be quite honest, i've actually heard a lot of weird shit when it comes to arm devices and storage failures. so it's statistically possible solely based on the number of times i've heard "disk failure" being a problem recently.
<grawity>	if you think it's corrupted, reinstall the affected packages
<theomurpse>	yup, but i've (intentionally) limited my follow-up questions to general stuff not specific to a single os (like how to read a journal file - thanks for that!) and the fstab stuff. i'll be going to the arm chan now. thanks! also, fwiw, this has been running successfully for two years, so not likely there's something too new for my cpu
<grawity>	for f in /var/lib/pacman/local/*/mtree; do gunzip < "$f"; done | perl -ne 'if (/^\.\/(\s+) .+ sha256digest=(\w+)/ && $1 !~ /^\.[a-z]+$/) {print "$2 /$1\n"}'
<theomurpse>	anyway, i keep regular backups - probably easiest to restore from one of those. i was just hoping to learn something about diagnosing the issue. you've been extremely kind and helpful, and i'll try to restore from backup and take my ass to the arm chan.
<grawity>	if you have file corruption, that'll tell you
<grawity>	ah, yeah, forgot | sha256sum -c
<grawity>	and probably | grep -v ok
<grawity>	well, no, |sha256sum -c --quiet
<grawity>	damn it, i'm sure there's already a script for that >_<
<arch-tk>	grawity: surely you need tr a-z a-z
<arch-tk>	and tee /dev/null
<theomurpse>	oh sweet jesus, that's a hairy command :)
<theomurpse>	ok yeah without the grep at the end, 49115 listed files could not be read, 6876 computed checksums did not match
<fungle>	grawity: damn i wish i can come up with scripts like that fast
<theomurpse>	what in the world is that command? it looks for the files in mtree (?) and compares the checksum with i guess some pre-determined checksum it should have and if they're different, corruption?
<grawity>	one or two might mean you need `sudo sha256sum` or you're just seeing edited config files (this doesn't care about config vs non-config), but ~7k is a serious problem
<arch-tk>	fungle: grawity is just a noise generator, he then translates the noise directly into perl by filtering only specific characters.
<grawity>	mtree is an extended filelist that pacman keeps for each package, generated at package build time
<grawity>	so the script takes all packages' mtree files together, and tries to mangle the format into something sha256sum can understand
<grawity>	it's something written two years ago actually, i just grepped it out of my logs this time
<theomurpse>	missing readme files, missing license files, failed to open python egg files
<theomurpse>	should i have sudo'ed this? lots of failed open or read.
<grawity>	(i'm sure there *is* a pacsomething script for that already, and in the future pacman -qkk will hopefully start doing sha256sums as well, but...)
<grawity>	dunno, for some files yes, `| sudo sha256sum...` specifically
<theomurpse>	just tried it, still looking like no such file or directory and tons of failed open or read
<grawity>	also, it doesn't handle mtree's filename escaping yet, so some false negatives
<sudokode>	grawity: allan has confirmed that but also admitted it can't be used
<sudokode>	i think it was allan
<sudokode>	2014-04-21 00:02:05     amcrae  it is all in the pacman code - libarchive does not support reading the checksums from the mtree files yet
<sudokode>	oh "yet"
<sudokode>	so maybe one day
<theomurpse>	ok so i'm going to image this drive and then try to restore from backup. i think i learned a lot today, especially how far below godlike i am at the command line :)
<theomurpse>	thanks, all, for your help.

<grawity>	sudokode: that $wbits thing is particularly awful
<grawity>	sudokode: (it's how you choose between three different framing formats, for some reason)
<grawity>	and compress::zlib is pretty much the same except it doesn't support gzip
<grawity>	io::zlib looks alright
<sudokode>	that is a bit ugly
<grawity>	oh, perlio::gzip actually exists too http://search.cpan.org/~nwclark/perlio-gzip-0.19/gzip.pm
<phrik>	title: perlio::gzip - search.cpan.org (at search.cpan.org)
<sudokode>	lol i like this one
<sudokode>	gzip -
<sudokode>	    the default. expects a standard gzip file header for reading, writes a standard gzip file header.
<sudokode>	auto - potentially dangerous. if the first two bytes match the gzip header "\x1f\x8b" then a gzip header is assumed (and checked) else a deflate stream is assumed. no different from gzip on writing.
<sudokode>	when your auto feature is potentially dangerous.........

<grawity>	it's annoying that deflate has three different formats, too
<sudokode>	everything's gotta have three other things
<fungle>	the rule of three
<sudokode>	which one?
<sudokode>	american pie?
<gehidore>	alien
<sudokode>	i forget that one
<gehidore>	super mario brothers
<sudokode>	uhhh
<sudokode>	nope
<gunndawg>	i've followed the installation process on the arch wiki. got grub installed, rebooted and now all it says is "booting..." but goes nowhere. this is a vm. any suggestions?
<gehidore>	you should check your grub config as you probably didn't change the config file(s) properly
<gunndawg>	# grub-install --target=i386-pc --recheck --debug /dev/sdx
<gunndawg>	# grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
<gunndawg>	thats how i configured it after pacman -s grub
<gunndawg>	not sdx, but sda
<kennae>	anyone want to recommend me some good monospace fonts to use on my terminal? 1600x900/15" thinkpad display with infinality font configs using ms fonts atm.
<fckr>	kennae: inconsolata
<kennae>	fonts generaly looks awesome everywhere but somehow deciding a monotype for me is so damn hard
<scottj>	kennae: inconsolata, dejavu sans mono, ubuntu mono, envy code r, source code pro, (rest are bitmap) terminus, gohufont, tamzen, tamsyn, dina, gomme
<grawity>	gzip -dc /var/lib/pacman/local/*/mtree | perl
<grawity>	why didn't i think of this before m(
<kennae>	scottj: fairly sure i wont be settling for a bitmap one and the first you said are really familiar to me
<kevr>	because, before you made that, you were thinking about other things!
<kennae>	just really hard to decide for me
<grawity>	source code pro, monaco.dfont, ubuntu mono are alright
<grawity>	consolas might be worth a try too
<kevr>	source code pro and consolas for life
<wasamasa>	and dejavu sans mono!
<kennae>	these are just for terminal that i use with regular system stuff + irc, i code on different app so not looking for only coding font
<dacoit>	tamsyn! also source code pro is for general use as well
<grawity>	dejavu sans mono is the courier new of open-source land, it's average but so overused everywhere
<kennae>	grawity: yea, consolas is great and so are most of what people have mentioned now
<wasamasa>	except that courier new doesn't span as many codepoints and doesn't have a wrecked percentage glyph
<kennae>	nobody rooting for droid slashed?
<grawity>	wasamasa: it doesn't span as many codepoints because windows supports font fallback
<kennae>	used it for a long time
<wasamasa>	grawity: but font fallback for monospace...
<wasamasa>	grawity: i dunno
<grawity>	the default fonts *are* rather good at unicode though
<grawity>	except, i think, older windows versions used to only install parts of the font, or something
<grawity>	dunno
<grawity>	the default x11 'fixed' font is also good >_>
<jasabelle>	gnu unifont is ugly but has wide coverage
<wasamasa>	unless your browser picks it and scales it up
<jasabelle>	i use inconsolata instead of consolas :)
<kevr>	you dont like big gaping letter spaces?"
<jasabelle>	nup
<kevr>	shucks
<wasamasa>	kevr: you should have written that in wide latin characters
<kevr>	lol
<wasamasa>	kevr: for greater effect
<dacoit>	w h a t s  w r o n g  w i t h  s p a c e s
<kennae>	anyone using pragmata pro? heard good things about it but never bothered to pay/find it to try
<jasabelle>	i need a good monospace font with cjk coverage
<kennae>	whats cjk coverage?
<grawity>	coverage of chinese/japanese/korean scripts
<namarrgon>	there's a truetype version of unifont somewhere but it's ugly as can be
<jasabelle>	namarrgon... yeah that's what i've been using begrudgingly
<fungle>	i'm using proggyfonts
<wasamasa>	jasabelle: uh, how can that possibly work for the extra-wide glyphs?
<grawity>	jasabelle: http://a.pomf.se/fxhmsq.dfont
<grawity>	jasabelle: monaco.dfont
<grawity>	wasamasa: uh, by using twice the horizontal width for glyphs categorized as "full-width" aka double-width?
<jasabelle>	unifont uses 2 character cells for the cjk characters
<wasamasa>	grawity: enomoremonospace
<grawity>	wasamasa: it's still perfectly monospace
<grawity>	jasabelle: though i can't actually *read* any of that, so my recommendations might actually turn out awful
<wasamasa>	"each character is monospaced, some are more monospaced than others!"
<dacoit>	lol
<wasamasa>	i mean, sure, lose the benefit of being able to align content with that
<dacoit>	for every wide glyph you have to use two half width commas :p
<wasamasa>	you could just as well use a regular cjk font as fallback and let your text editor or terminal emulator handle the alignment
<jasabelle>	maybe i should start using tabs for programming so i dont need a monospace font :p
<grawity>	in fact, yes, aren't regular cjk fonts *always* monospace?
<kevr>	instead of spaces?
<wasamasa>	jasabelle: i actually recall an individual who was hellbent on making that work with emacs, yet lacked any incentive make it happen
<kevr>	ew
<james0r>	i'm getting some errors that says somethign about fido during the boot process just before my dm runs. what log would i look at to start debugging this?
<grawity>	wasamasa: http://a.uguu.se/qqzekn_2015-05-11.101505.temp.png i think it aligns just fine, no?

<grawity>	it works by default...
<wasamasa>	grawity: it's mixing that is problematic
<grawity>	it's not
<grawity>	it's exactly either one cell or two cells
<grawity>	see the second screenshot
<wasamasa>	or just change font sizes to see it break down
<grawity>	it's the same across all font sizes.
<wasamasa>	it's kind of hilarious with the unicode demos on that page for the fixed font
<wasamasa>	i bothered using it, displayed them in less, changed the font size and lo-and-behold, alignment went down the river
<jasabelle>	hmmm
<grawity>	hrmm, meanwhile, gedit doesn't handle it well, but then it screws up even the arrow triangles

<user1397>	i'm trying to dualboot win 8.1 and arch, followed beginner's guide to the letter, only one section had me a bit confused, and now when i restart my comp i arrive at a grub shell (not the rescue shell) automatically
<dacoit>	did you grub-mkconfig
<user1397>	yes
<user1397>	the section that confused me was this: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/grub#check_if_you_have_gpt_and_an_esp
<phrik>	title: grub - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<user1397>	i checked using the parted /dev/sda print command and yes i obviously do already have an esp partition (specifically located at /dev/sda2)
<user1397>	but then in the following section, during grub-install, it doesnt say how to set /dev/sda2 for the path
<user1397>	grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=$esp --bootloader-id=grub --recheck
<dacoit>	you would mount /dev/sda2 to /mnt/boot
<user1397>	ah crap
<dacoit>	and then /mnt/boot is the efi-directory
<user1397>	i did mount /dev/sda2 /boot
<user1397>	doh!!!
<dacoit>	outside of your chroot?
<user1397>	nope inside
<dacoit>	well /boot inside the chroot <==> /mnt/boot outside
<user1397>	i never mounted /boot outside though
<dacoit>	oh :p
<dacoit>	at least its an easy fix
<user1397>	since i didnt create an extra /boot partition
<user1397>	unsure how to go about it now that i rebooted already...care to point me in the right direction?
<moetunes>	->
<dacoit>	reboot to the live disc again, and mount your "/" partition to /mnt
<dacoit>	and then your esp (/dev/sda2) to /mnt/boot
<user1397>	do i chroot first?
<dacoit>	arch-chroot
<dacoit>	after mounting required partitions
<user1397>	ah
<dacoit>	and finally grub-install, mkconfig etc
<user1397>	awesome, trying it now brb
<user1397>	hmm same thing happened
<user1397>	once im in the chroot do i have to reinstall grub and efibootmgr before i run grub-install
<user1397>	just thought about it
<dacoit>	well, if they are installed from you pacman -s'ing in a prior attempt, they'll still be there
<user1397>	hmm
<dacoit>	did the generated grub config look right?
<user1397>	and in the grub-install command, if i point it to /boot and not /mnt/boot it should work?
<dacoit>	after chroot
<user1397>	ahh
<dacoit>	, /mnt becomes / (change root) and thus /mnt/boot is /boot
<user1397>	so yea it said done or success or something like that, but didnt actually list any entries
<user1397>	gotcha
<user1397>	i forgot its supposed to show entries once it generates
<user1397>	so basically somethings going on with grub-mkconfig i guess
<dacoit>	once in the chroot, do a lsblk -f so you see the partitions and where they're mounted, and compare the listed uuid's from lsblk -f to the ones in grub.cfg
<user1397>	ok
<red-lichtie>	abs question: how do i re-"makepkg" hving edited a source file and keeping my changes?
<user1397>	whe i chroot do i have to do the entire command as listed in the beginners guide (arch-chroot /mnt /bin/bash) or just arch-chroot
<dacoit>	iirc it bash is needed specifically so its good to leave it
<user1397>	ok
<user1397>	ok so lsblk -f does say the / and /boot partitions are mounted, but it does not list any uuids
<jasabelle>	lsblk -o name,uuid
<dacoit>	is this an mbr partition table then?
<namarrgon>	red-lichtie: "makepkg -h" look for noextract
<user1397>	it is definitely gpt
<jasabelle>	you want the partuuid for your bootloader
<user1397>	that command gave me blank uuids again jasabelle
<jasabelle>	did you format them? :)
<jasabelle>	(the partitions)
<jasabelle>	uuid are generated upon formatting
<namarrgon>	run lsblk outside the chroot
<dacoit>	he was preserving prior esp, so he cant
<user1397>	i only formatted /
<jasabelle>	ok
<user1397>	with the mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdxy command
<user1397>	ill try running it outside chroot
<jasabelle>	from what i understand, the partuuid (which is what gummiboot wants) is supposed to survive formatting so your esp info should still be valid
<user1397>	i'm using grub
<user1397>	ok outside chroot i see the uuids
<user1397>	now do i have to go back to chroot to look at grub.cfg?
<dacoit>	without chrooting, pull up /mnt/boot/path/to/cfg
<dacoit>	and see if it has correct device paths
<user1397>	i think i see whats wrong
<user1397>	under main menuentry
<user1397>	under set root
<user1397>	it says hd0,msdos5 whereas it should be gpt5
<red-lichtie>	namarrgon: thanks, "makepkg -sf --noprepare --noextract" seems to have don the trick
<user1397>	no idea how that happened tho :/
<user1397>	no idea how to edit that either hehe
<jasabelle>	grub wants partuuid too :d
<jasabelle>	but ignore me, i'm pondering switching over to grub :)
<user1397>	:p
<user1397>	ok if i look at the grub.cfg inside the chroot, there are no entries just the default comments
<user1397>	does that one matter or outside chroot only matters in this situation?
<jeromelanteri>	i have my iommu groups who are not well separates. considreing this post: http://vfio.blogspot.sg/2014/08/iommu-groups-inside-and-out.html , and the fact i have xeone3/1200 first onboard graphic proc and nvidia gtx750 pci card with i7 pocessor, how can i isolate iommu groups (or patch acs to the kernel: actualy linux-4.0.2-1 arch with gcc-5.1.0) ?
<phrik>	title: vfio tips and tricks: iommu groups, inside and out (at vfio.blogspot.sg)
<user1397>	wait am i supposed to do the mkconfig command outside the chroot?
<kevr>	inside
<bakednotfried>	does anyone here use getmail?
<user1397>	thanks
<kevr>	np ;)
<user1397>	so i guess whats happening here is that inside my chroot my uuids arent being read, so the grub-mkconfig command doesn't know where to find the partitions
<user1397>	but i dont understand why this is happening..hmm
<kevr>	did you run genfstab and stuff?
<namarrgon>	ls /mnt/boot
<user1397>	i did run genfstab
<user1397>	namarrgon: ok you def found somethin', says no such file or directory
<user1397>	but i dont understand, i mounted it outside the chroot
<namarrgon>	are you in the chroot?
<bakednotfried>	user1397 you did grub-install?
<kevr>	are -
<user1397>	yes i am now
<namarrgon>	user1397: ls /boot
<user1397>	ah ok ls /boot brings up boot-sav efi grub
<namarrgon>	user1397: what happened to the kernel?
<kevr>	maybe he installed when /boot wasnt mounted, then mounted /boot
<kevr>	methinks
<namarrgon>	user1397: you pacstrap'ped before you mounted /mnt/boot?
<user1397>	yes :(
<user1397>	does this mean i have to reinstall everything?
<jasabelle>	oops
<namarrgon>	user1397: umount /mnt/boot, rm everything in /mnt/boot, mount /mnt/boot again, reinstall kernel+grub
<jasabelle>	you'll be installing, not reinstalling ;)
<jasabelle>	heh http://papyros.io/
<phrik>	title: papyros (at papyros.io)
<user1397>	i was thinking, what if in the grub-install command instead of putting the path at /boot i put it at something more specific like /boot/efi/microsoft/boot/bootmgfw.efi?
<user1397>	or does that not matter
<namarrgon>	that makes no sense
<user1397>	ok then hehe
<user1397>	ok now when you say reinstall kernel which command are you talking about exactly
<namarrgon>	pacman
<jasabelle>	gummiboot is so much easier than grub
<kevr>	pacman -s linux
<user1397>	ok and namarrgon when you said to umount /mnt/boot etc, did u mean inside chroot?
<kevr>	anytime /mnt is referenced in this process, it's meant to be outside of the root
<user1397>	alas i am not familiar with gummiboot :/
<user1397>	ok kevr
<user1397>	that worked guys...thanks so much
<user1397>	glad i didnt have to do a complete reinstall hehe :p
<kevr>	it wouldve been literally like what
<kevr>	10-15 commands to get to where you were
<kevr>	=p
<user1397>	hehe yea i guess but...still haha
<kevr>	for sure
<techieagnostic>	does anyone here use okular?

<fireboot>	hi guys
<fireboot>	question: i'd like to upgrade my system, but excluding a few packages
<fireboot>	any idea how to do this?
<longlive>	does anyone an idea for docky issue?
<arthur33>	fireboot: use --ignore :)
<arthur33>	longlive: i just installed docky and it seems to run just fine here. did you use the community package ?
<fireboot>	oh
<fireboot>	thanks
<zer0rest>	fireboot, keep in mind that partial upgrades are not supported
<fireboot>	what do you call partial upgrades?
<longlive>	i'm new on arch , i install it with yaourt
<arthur33>	in other words: if some program doesn't start claiming "libthing.so not found"
<fireboot>	long story short, i want to upgrade everything except my kernel
<arthur33>	oh.
<fireboot>	(and its dependencies)
<jasabelle>	pacman -syu
<zer0rest>	fireboot, why not use linux-lts?
<fireboot>	it's too old
<zer0rest>	fair enough
<fireboot>	i'm using at work a proprietary framework that doesn't work with linux 4
<fireboot>	so i need to stick with linux 3.19
<jeromelanteri>	this is acs patch: https://lkml.org/lkml/diff/2013/5/30/513/1 but from tis, how to patch the kernel ?
<jeromelanteri>	this
<arthur33>	if it's the kernel you can ignore linux,linux-docs,linux,headers but watch out for external modules like nvidia
<longlive>	is possible purge docky on arch like ubuntu ?
<fireboot>	yeah arthur33 from the top of my head i will have to ignore linux linux-headers nvidia bbswitch
<arthur33>	fireboot: if you have nvidia and bbswitch
<arthur33>	use -dkms packages
<jasabelle>	should i install ufw?
<arthur33>	so you can continue upgrading them
<fireboot>	oh.
<arthur33>	and they will be built against *your* kernel
<arthur33>	much simpler :d
<fireboot>	that's sweet, thanks dude
<arthur33>	(just do dkms autoinstall -k kernel.version after a module update)
<fireboot>	what's the policy about linux-lts in arch?
<arthur33>	longlive: what do you mean by purge ?
<arthur33>	fireboot: don't know, updating the -lst till it's not supported anymore then upgrade to the next -lts version i think
<longlive>	remove complete setting file and everything of docky . sorry my english is not good
<fireboot>	arthur33: ok. i was wondering, when should we expect the latest lts kernel to be available in arch
<fireboot>	according to kernel.org, the latest lts is 3.18 while arch's lts is 3.14
<longlive>	like this http://askubuntu.com/questions/151941/how-can-you-completely-remove-a-package
<phrik>	title: uninstall - how can you completely remove a package? - ask ubuntu (at askubuntu.com)
<arthur33>	longlive; no your english is correct, it's just it's a ubuntu term and i don't use it.
<fireboot>	so you mean when 3.14 reaches eol, arch will bump to the next longterm?
<arthur33>	fireboot: yes
<fireboot>	ok, makes sense
<avrelaun>	hi, i can't start qemu with kvm, it gives me the following error: "could not access kvm kernel module: permission denied" "failed to initialize kvm: permission denied"
<fireboot>	cheers
<namarrgon>	fireboot: arch sticks to one lts branch until the maintainers think it's time to switch
<avrelaun>	modules are properly loaded, vt is enabled in bios, it works as root but not as user
<avrelaun>	using the same os on my laptop it works with a user
<arthur33>	longlive: pacman -rsn allows you to remove a package, all it's dependancies and system config files (ie not those in your home, they need to be cleaned manually as pacman won't mess in your home)
<longlive>	well i need use docky on arch and it doesn't open , i can't remove again arch and install it . i want fix this error of docky .
<avrelaun>	is there a specifi group for kvm ?
<avrelaun>	didn't find one
<avrelaun>	*haven't found one
<arthur33>	avrelaun: it's 'kvm' i think ?
<longlive>	ok
<fireboot>	upgrading to kde 5.10. hopefully it will be better than 5.9, which was the worst release i have used in years
<longlive>	which is directory of docky that i remove manually ?
<avrelaun>	arthur33: on my laptop my regular user isn't in kvm group
<avrelaun>	arthur33: and it works
<kyusaki>	my laptop wanted to kill itself after installing the new kde plasma thingy >_>
<longlive>	sorry guys i will comeback 30 min
<longlive>	sorry
<arthur33>	longlive: search in your home, it can be ~/.docky, ~/.config/docky, ~/.local/share/docky etc
<avrelaun>	arch wiki: "adding a user to the kvm group [...] has been deprecated in favor of using udev rules, and this is done automatically. "
<jeromelanteri>	avrelaun: you can configure yourself the group you want it go with.
<avrelaun>	guess it's a udev problem
<jeromelanteri>	and then you have to put the group the rules can mount with your user (generaly inside group wheel and users)
<avrelaun>	jeromelanteri: my user already had wheel abd users groups
<jeromelanteri>	is someone here know how to patch a kernel from a file ?
<avrelaun>	i added kvm group manually and it works,
<jeromelanteri>	avrelun: fine.
<avrelaun>	thanks
<jeromelanteri>	avrelaun: do you want to do some pci passtrough ?
<arthur33>	jeromelanteri: go in the root directory of the kernel source, then patch -np1 -i yourfile.patch ? (the -p1 is to remove the a/ b/ from the patch file names, when they are before file names to distinguish old and new source dir)
<avrelaun>	jeromelanteri: i just need network and vnc
<avrelaun>	i'm trying to make a build vm in a headless server
<jeromelanteri>	avrrelan: you are lucky...
<jeromelanteri>	arthur, so from this link: https://lkml.org/lkml/diff/2013/5/30/513/1, i just have to copy/paste in a new file and do what you tell me (what about the name of the file ? is it important ?)...
<arthur33>	see on diff --git lines
<arthur33>	there are a/ b/ in front of filenames
<arthur33>	-p 1 allows patch to remove them to find the actual files to patch
<arthur33>	so yes you put that in a patch file, and go to the base dir of your linux sources and patch -np1 -i file.patch :)
<arthur33>	and that's done
<gunndawg>	i just installed arch, and xorg. i installed gnome, executed systemctl enable gdm.service and rebooted and now when gnome should be launching i get a "oh no! something has gone wrong" error message with a frown face. any suggestions?
<namarrgon>	!give gunndawg wiki xinitrc
<phrik>	gunndawg: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xinitrc
<arthur33>	what graphic card do you have ? did you install the proper drivers ?
<namarrgon>	make sure x itself works before you mess with a dm
<gunndawg>	namarrgon: back, x worked fine before i installed gnome. i could run startx and get the basic xorg windows
<namarrgon>	"basic xorg windows"?
<gunndawg>	yes
<namarrgon>	twm and xterm?
<arthur33>	gunndawg: so it may be a acceleration problem (gnome needs 3d acceleration)
<gunndawg>	xterm
<namarrgon>	what about gnome?
<gunndawg>	its a vm let me enable 3d and see what gives
<gunndawg>	hmmmm enabling 3d support in virtualbox and restarting yields the same error
<namarrgon>	set up ~/.xinitrc to run gnome, post the xorg log
<gunndawg>	namarrgon: i'm not even sure how to get back out to a terminal. auto boots into this error now
<namarrgon>	boot into the multi-user.target
<namarrgon>	or any other target that isn't graphical.target
<gunndawg>	i dont have any boot options. i fire up the vm. goes straight into trying to load gnome and errors out
<arthur33>	add systemd.target=multi-user.target to the kernel argumets
<arthur33>	arguments *
<arthur33>	systemd.unit sorry
<gunndawg>	where am i going to find kernal arguments in a vm?
<arthur33>	in the bootloader
<arthur33>	where you have root=/dev/blabla
<gunndawg>	yeah but how do i access that without a terminal?
<arthur33>	if it's grub you can ctrl-e to edit the arguments before booting
<arthur33>	(if it's syslinux it's tab)
<gunndawg>	ok got it
<gunndawg>	its open
<kklimonda>	any idea why would i get no sound from headphones? i can see system switching to them, they seem to be unmuted, but no sound
<gunndawg>	so i am in the gnu grub settings
<arthur33>	gunndawg: there is a line with some arguments (like root=, rw etc) you can add systemd.unit=multi-user.target
<gunndawg>	arthur33: i see "set root='hd0,gpt2'
<arthur33>	ah not that line
<arthur33>	that's 'grub' root setting, not the kernel one
<arthur33>	there's a line named append or like so ?
<gunndawg>	arthur33: not seeing that. these settings seem to be mostly for grub only
<arthur33>	hmm is there a line with ro or rw on it ?..
<gunndawg>	arthur33: menuentry stuff
<kevr>	i usually just press e, not ctrl+e
<longlive>	arthur33 thanks i remove these directory and it fixed
<kevr>	might be misremembering, though, i haven't used grub in a while. i use gummiboot now.
<gunndawg>	arthur33:  linux /vmlinuz-linux root=uuid=f9b135e2-4352-46ca-a03d-279ba59235eb rw quiet
<arthur33>	yes this one
<arthur33>	you can add the systemd.unit=multi-user.target here
<gunndawg>	alright, i'm on that line now
<gunndawg>	arthur33: just add that to the end of it?
<arthur33>	yep
<gunndawg>	arthur33: i made those changes and used f10 to boot. i'm seeing some unreliable dma position messages and a blinking cursor
<gunndawg>	arthur33: wait, i'm back out to a terminal login, good
<gunndawg>	now to fix the gnome
<arthur33>	^^
<gunndawg>	i think you had mentioned adding gnome to an init file?
<arthur33>	not me, but namarrgon said "set up ~/.xinitrc to run gnome, post the xorg log"
<gunndawg>	xorg.conf.d is empty if that helps anything
<namarrgon>	!give gunndawg wiki xinitrc
<phrik>	gunndawg: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xinitrc
<gunndawg>	namarrgon: is commenting out exec xterm and adding exec gnome sufficient?
<namarrgon>	echo 'exec gnome-session' > ~/.xinitrc
<namarrgon>	you don't need most of the stuff from /etc's xinitrc
<demize>	might still want to source the stuff in /etc/x11/xinit/xinitrc.d/ though.
<luyin>	hi, i just installed yaourt. now i still have the yaourt and the package-query folders in my home dir. may i safely remove these?
<kevr>	yup
<gunndawg>	demize: what do you mean "source the stuff"? i'm in that folder now. how would i "source" it?
<lowpass>	hi
<pharpend>	hi lowpass
<demize>	gunndawg: with `source`. though i meant in thi xinitrc, though it seems like the default one doesn't do it anymore, hmm..
<gunndawg>	demize: i've commented out the twm lines in the xinitrc and added exec gnome-session and still not able to get it running with startx
<demize>	!errormsg
<phrik>	post the _exact_, _verbatim_ error message. paraphrasing, reciting from memory, or otherwise being vague will earn you a swift boot to the head.
<gunndawg>	demize: http://i.imgur.com/yjs5dmt.jpg
<demize>	check the x11 log
<sudokode>	demize: fetch me some coffee
<demize>	sudokode: no.
<sudokode>	:(
<pmted>	installing a custom kernel (surfacepro3). i have downloaded the pkgbuild and ran makepkg. do i need to do anything more after that?
<wasamasa>	boot it
<wasamasa>	install it
<wasamasa>	tell your bootloader about it
<a1ynx>	why would a usb mouse suddenly swap left/right click behavious? (i.e left click showing right click menu)
<wasamasa>	not in that order necessarily
<diegoviola>	where do i install the bootloader when using uefi? mbr?
<diegoviola>	i'm new with uefi
<bakednotfried>	diegoviola it needs a 1mb partition on a gpt disk
<arthur33>	diegoviola:https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/unified_extensible_firmware_interface https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/syslinux#uefi_systems https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/grub#uefi_systems
<phrik>	title: unified extensible firmware interface - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<diegoviola>	ok thanks
<pmted>	how do i install the kernel? ./linux.install gives me a permission denied.
<rkreis_>	pmted, pacman -u the .pkg file, or run makepkg -i
<pmted>	rkreis_: ah, thanks!
<firedingo>	so i've tried out a bunch of desktop environments but i keep coming back to kde/plasma. i'm wondering is there something like kde/plasma but uses less memory?
<grawity>	like kde/plasma in which ways?
<nkparadox>	firedingo: enlightment maybe?
<firedingo>	i generally like the layout of it. i do like the glass look of plasma but it's not overly important it just made the choice to move from kde 4. i like useability, the intuitiveness.
<firedingo>	i look at gnome for example and it reminds of macs to begin with and then i start to hate everything about it. it's clunky, unintuitive and generally not nice for me to use.
<grawity>	curiously, that's exactly why i avoid recent kde like hell
<grawity>	anyway, there aren't many more; enlightenment is fancy but a bit obscure, cinnamon is basically just "better gnome 3", and xfce4 & mate are both very windows 2000-era
<cloudef>	i know people who have used icewm always
<cloudef>	so if you want desktop that doesn't suddenly change, icewm or any of the *box are good
<cloudef>	(or any of the tiling wms of course :p)
<firedingo>	yeah. i'm not anti windows 2000-era. heck i still swear xp is the best version of windows i've ever used but as cool as kde/plasma is i'm still looking for the right one for me.
<firedingo>	but thanks nkparadox, grawity and cloudef. :)
<gulzar>	c++ help. which is a good c++ ide with super awesome autocomplete and suggestions?. i know there is clion and netbeans but they are tooooo bloat . codeblocks doesnot play nice with inconsolata and monaco fonts. any other ide?
<grawity>	visual studio code? >_>
<arthur33>	qtcreator ? =d
<grawity>	recent gedit/gnome-builder supports clang-based autocomplete, apparently
<arthur33>	(c++ built, not java, and very nice autocompletion features)
<kevr>	you could use vim
<kevr>	with youcompleteme
<kevr>	:d
<grawity>	yeah, qtcreator might be good
<hannibal_smith>	gulzar, kdevelop
<gulzar>	arthur33: tried qtcreator and kdevelop but no idea how to compile and see the results. qtcreator : all options are greyed. kdevelop asks for configuration..
<hannibal_smith>	gulzar, what do you mean with "kdevelop ask for configuration..."?
<hannibal_smith>	do you have gcc, gdb...installed?
<gulzar>	hannibal_smith: i will uplaod the screenshot
<gulzar>	hannibal_smith: yes
<hannibal_smith>	also cmake?
<thelemonman>	i guess the make&run setup works only for the projects created within qtcreator
<gulzar>	hannibal_smith: yes cmake is also there
<hannibal_smith>	gulzar, pass a screenshot
<hannibal_smith>	maybe someone can give some help
<xiaoming94>	how do you change the decorator theme in compiz when using gtk-window-decorator? the content in the archwiki doesn't seem to work
<gulzar>	hannibal_smith: http://imagebin.ca/v/21lrvpppjadt . with shift+f9
<phrik>	title: imagebin - somewhere to store random things (at imagebin.ca)
<hannibal_smith>	gulzar, kdevelop don't uses internally any "project file" to understand your project structure and dependency
<hannibal_smith>	instead it uses cmake
<gulzar>	hannibal_smith: so what is the way to configure kdevelop
<hannibal_smith>	gulzar, to start it's better simply creating a new project
<hannibal_smith>	and try to write some code
<hannibal_smith>	(new project from the wizard)
<hannibal_smith>	if you actually want to use c++, anyway you will have to learn cmake
<hannibal_smith>	as is pretty standard in open source and commercial c++ codebase
<hannibal_smith>	but if you start from whe project template that kdevelop give to you
<hannibal_smith>	it's actually easier to start
<hannibal_smith>	and if you need something, stackoverflow is full of questions regarding cmake
<hannibal_smith>	so for a good series of problems (how i add a depency on a library..., how i use c++11...)
<hannibal_smith>	a google search is enough
<kevr>	you don't _have_ to learn cmake to use c++, at all
<kevr>	it's just one build system among many.
<hannibal_smith>	"many"
<saivert>	yes but anything using cmake already should be easy to import into the ide
<kevr>	ah.
<hannibal_smith>	saivert, yes, and also clinon (new commercial jetbrains ide)
<saivert>	autotools/automake should be possible to import too or convert to cmake
<hannibal_smith>	has made the same choice of kdevelop
<gulzar>	hannibal_smith: new project , and this http://ibin.co/21ltazcmjs2v .is it looking alright?
<gulzar>	hannibal_smith: saivert : clion is toooo bloat, 400+mb installtion. i isntalled it but so bug so removed
<hannibal_smith>	gulzar, i would add -std=c++11 -wall
<hannibal_smith>	to the extra arguments
<gulzar>	hannibal_smith: done.. i have them in geany
<gulzar>	hannibal_smith: anything else?
<hannibal_smith>	gulzar, no it should be enough
<arunkrish>	where can i find my personal keys ?
<hannibal_smith>	ah gulzar if you hae problems, kdevelop has a irc channel here
<hannibal_smith>	a good number of kdevelop devs are european
<gulzar>	hannibal_smith: ah, right
<dynamicmetaflow>	hello
<gulzar>	hannibal_smith: compiling is done, f8, but how to see the output? shidt f9 is again showing same first image upload
<gulzar>	hannibal_smith: i will join kdevelop cahnnel
<hannibal_smith>	gulzar, i have to go away now
<hannibal_smith>	peopel in kdevelop will help you
<hannibal_smith>	is really a well made ide
<longlive>	hello
<hannibal_smith>	so i don't think will take too much to appreciate and learn it
<gulzar>	hannibal_smith: thank you
<longlive>	i install gnome-disk. but when i run it window has huge black border. see this screenshot http://i58.tinypic.com/9h4492.png
<dynamicmetaflow>	hello, i've been working on my arch install since the weekend. been succesful so far except my touchpad which does work and function in arch under system settings > input devices > touchpad > "no device found" does anyone have any suggestions?
<milenus>	what brand is your laptop?
<dynamicmetaflow>	lenovo yoga 2 pro
<gulzar>	dynamicmetaflow: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/touchpad_synaptics
<phrik>	title: touchpad synaptics - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<dynamicmetaflow>	i have read that page on the wiki
<gulzar>	longlive: yup , you need to change the gtk setting and remove those borders
<dynamicmetaflow>	already copied the config from /usr/share.../50-synaptics.conf to /etc/x11/.... configured there, also used synclient
<longlive>	gulzar how can i do that?
<dynamicmetaflow>	the touchpad works i just wonder why under system settings > mouse input it reports "no device found"
<gulzar>	longlive: google,
<gulzar>	longlive: you can fing it easily
<kennae>	dynamicmetaflow: it uses some generic touchpad driver automaticly but can't somehow know what your device id really is
<kennae>	so it works with the defaults but it can't show any options
<dynamicmetaflow>	ah so all it needs is the device id?
<dynamicmetaflow>	xinput says its 13
<kennae>	i mean, it knows you have a touchpad and it knows the id but it doesn't somehow know and use the more advanced device specific settings
<kennae>	no idea how to fix that, sorry, just thinking out loud about possibilities
<dynamicmetaflow>	thanks i like that
<dynamicmetaflow>	thinking out loud purposes: when i first installed arch it was able to pick it up somewhat but still reported problems regarding the settings not being the ones being used. i then made some change to 50-synaptics.conf in the alternate configuration folder and had a problem booting up with dhcpcd. after finally booting up and everything work im back to square 1 with the touchpad
<kennae>	infact i need to setup my thinkpad touchpad tonight so i don't need gnome stuff to give the settings
<kennae>	i can shout to you later if you can't figure it out
<dynamicmetaflow>	thanks yeah let me know im trying to think of a solution
<kennae>	i was going to set it up from the config and forget the gui
<kennae>	so it works always everywhere
<dynamicmetaflow>	the default config?
<kennae>	yea, by editing the touchpad configs
<dynamicmetaflow>	i set it up in the alternate path destination but not the original one
<dynamicmetaflow>	i did configure it but nothing
<dynamicmetaflow>	didn't think editing the default config would help if it can't pick it up at all
<kennae>	even if the gui doesn't show anything, it shoudn't affect the way the config is loaded
<kennae>	it shoudn't get blocked and should be enough to just get it right
<dynamicmetaflow>	well ill create a backup of the default config from usr/share
<dynamicmetaflow>	and ill configure it there then
<kennae>	i remember using some synaptics command line utility to easily get my settings right, disable tap+drag etc.
<kennae>	and it wrote the config as you changed them
<kennae>	has been few years so can't really remember but its not that bad thing to get just right, don't worry :)
<dynamicmetaflow>	the sysclient right?
<dynamicmetaflow>	lol
<dynamicmetaflow>	thanks its just been working on this excessively thats all
<kennae>	yea sounds familiar
<dynamicmetaflow>	trying to get everything fine
<th0rne>	how to bittorrent when ports are blocked? i have transmission.
<c0de1>	vpn maybe?
<c0de1>	try another port
<th0rne>	can i use 80 for bittorrent or will that result in a clusterfuck?
<c0de1>	why would you want to use p80 for that?
<th0rne>	i guess i don't.
<c0de1>	you can, probably. but just choose a random port :p
<arthur33>	not blocked anywhere maybe c0de1
<th0rne>	i would think random ports are blocked.
<c0de1>	well also, to use port 80 you would require root right?
<arthur33>	yup any port < 1024 will
<c0de1>	indeed
<th0rne>	i have root. they're blocked on the router.
<c0de1>	what about skype? does that work
<arthur33>	skype automatically use ports 80 / 443 if he can't use anything elste
<arthur33>	else *
<th0rne>	i don't have skype. isn't there a way to see which ports work?
<c0de1>	do you control the router?
<th0rne>	no.
<c0de1>	i presume not
<th0rne>	:)
<c0de1>	so are you aware specifically which ports are blocked? or all?
<yoshi314>	you could run external port scan
<th0rne>	no, i actually don't know. only bittorrent seems to not work.
<c0de1>	which client?
<th0rne>	transmission.
<jeromelanteri>	where are currently the source of a kernel installed from pacman package manager ?
<c0de1>	try port 62101
<c0de1>	clcik test port
<arthur33>	jeromelanteri> by default there aren't sources installed, but you can have headers by installing linux-headers
<c0de1>	*click
<th0rne>	hold on, i have transmission daemon with transmission remote cli, so there's nothing to click. :)
<arthur33>	(which will be put undel /usr/lib/modules/[kernel version]/build/)
<arthur33>	under *
<c0de1>	ah, you'll have to edit config files then
<th0rne>	does the web ui allow to change the port?
<th0rne>	ah, it does.
<jeromelanteri>	th0rne: i was with transmission, but at the time someone talk me about deluge and i tryed it... i stay with deluge (more ability to config it, and very good also)
<toqoz>	how can i stop mpd from using the config in /etc/.mpdconf when starting from systemd?
<th0rne>	i've tried both, but i like transmission. it's a pain in the ass to configure, but i've found that it really has a lot of options.
<toqoz>	i want it to use /home/user/.config/mpd/mpd.conf instead
<jeromelanteri>	toqoz: systemctl stop mpd maybe ?
<th0rne>	and the daemon is nice. and i made a script for firefox to send magnet links to it when i click on them.
<c0de1>	th0rne, can you use a vpn?
<th0rne>	i don't have one, so i guess not?
<c0de1>	buy one?
<c0de1>	just a suggestion :)
<th0rne>	:)
<toqoz>	jeromelanteri: i want to start it with systemd, so this will not work as next time i start it will do the same thing.
<th0rne>	how to see what ports of mine can be reached? externally or what not?
<jeromelanteri>	yes, i read it after... i search...
<c0de1>	as someone else suggested, you could do an external port scan of the sorts
<toqoz>	there must be a way to make it read the config in the home directory instead of /etc/
<th0rne>	how does one do that?
<earnestly>	grawity: heh, pony uses 'runes' too
<sh4tr>	does wine create/modify anything outside ~/.wine
<th0rne>	http://codepad.org/0dpsloun
<phrik>	title: plain text code - 23 lines - codepad (at codepad.org)
<earnestly>	sh4tr: what do you want to know exactly?
<th0rne>	so 8080 maybe?
<sh4tr>	earnestly: could wine or the free-of-charge proprietary app mess the system
<c0de1>	yes try 8080
<earnestly>	sh4tr: yes
<earnestly>	sh4tr: i'm not sure what you mean by "free-of-charge proprietary app"
<sh4tr>	closed sourse
<earnestly>	what?
<earnestly>	please be exact, it really helps me
<earnestly>	wine has access to all your user does unless you disable the unixfs

<jeromelanteri>	i read the wiki around linux kernel(s), but i not see the information about where are the sources of kernels (sure, when installed kernel headers i think)... someone know ?
<ineb>	sh4tr: consider a virtual machine
<earnestly>	sh4tr: and this is why i don't like answering questions like this
<arthur33>	the headears are under /usr/lib/modules/version/build jeromelanteri
<earnestly>	sh4tr: what is the *real* problem
<earnestly>	is there even one?
<arthur33>	only the headers, not the complete sources
<jeromelanteri>	arthur33: thank you
<sh4tr>	im being chicken
<arthur33>	jeromelanteri> (you can ask it to pacman with pacman -ql linux-headers)
<sh4tr>	your right i should stick with virtual machine
<guardian>	hello, if i enable testing in pacman.conf will gcc 5.1 replace current 4.9? i would like to have both installed and gcc 4.9 be the default
<toqoz>	jeromelanteri: thank you so much!
<sh4tr>	it will
<arthur33>	guardian> it will replace it because it's the same package name ('gcc') only the version differs
<jeromelanteri>	arthur33: so it is normaly from here than it could be possible to patch the kernel... right ?
<guardian>	ok thanks
<arthur33>	jeromelanteri> no
<dynamicmetaflow>	jerome hi
<jeromelanteri>	(crying)
<guardian>	waiting it enters stable then
<jeromelanteri>	dynamicmetaflow: hi man.
<arthur33>	you need to download the pkgbuild of linux from the abs
<sh4tr>	guardian: http://dpaste.com/32bdbat
<phrik>	title: dpaste: 32bdbat (at dpaste.com)
<arthur33>	makepkg --nobuild to get the sources
<jeromelanteri>	arthur33: what is the "abs" ?
<arthur33>	go into the source dir, patch your kernel then makepkg --noextract
<arthur33>	abs: arch build system
<arthur33>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/arch_build_system
<jeromelanteri>	arthur33: good news, thanks again.
<phrik>	title: arch build system - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<tigrmesh>	wait.
<kevr>	ok.
<tigrmesh>	jeromelanteri, you didn't know what abs is?
<jeromelanteri>	tigrmesh: no.
<jeromelanteri>	tigrmesh: you want a bear ?
<jeromelanteri>	or drink a rhum ?
<tigrmesh>	jeromelanteri, you've been here since 2014-10-19.  how could you not know?
<jeromelanteri>	tigrmesh: very simple: i never have to use it. first time i patch my kernel.
<arthur33>	tigrmesh> maybe he didn't need it untill now
<arthur33>	(oops too slow :p)
<jeromelanteri>	tigrmesh: the question could be also: how you not find the answer by yourself ?  lol
<arthur33>	jeromelanteri> if you have yaourt you can simplify it
<tigrmesh>	hehe
<arthur33>	by just doing yaourt -g linux
<arthur33>	and it will download the pkgbuild itself
<jeromelanteri>	yes, i think i can do man yaourt and find the option for just download the package... right ?
<jeromelanteri>	lol
<jeromelanteri>	and go under /tmp/..; blablabla...
<tigrmesh>	jeromelanteri, just download the tarball and unpack it.  or use cower
<arthur33>	not necessarily, you can build under your home
<jeromelanteri>	cower ? (an other one new think for me...)
<jeromelanteri>	arthur33: yes i read the wiki talk about that also...
<tigrmesh>	part of how yaourt works is it opens the files
<tigrmesh>	right in the editor you specify
<jeromelanteri>	i'm not sure, but i know than go by yaourt could be the lighter choice (for hdd space use)... is it ?
<dynamicmetaflow>	just throwing a tip there for people x.flux or redshift application, great for your eyes automatically adjusts the color to the day and such
<tigrmesh>	i don't understand
<jeromelanteri>	arthur33: good... i'm just at home right now. lol
<jeromelanteri>	(i tryed to eat eggs of red ants...)
<ville>	howdy. anyone running arch on lenovo x1? anything particular to look out for when installing?
<jeromelanteri>	thai guys eat really every things...
<tigrmesh>	ville, tthere's a wiki page about thinkpads.  is it a thinkpad?
<ville>	yeah it's a thinkpad. let's have a looksee
<ineb>	!g lenovo x1 archlinux
<phrik>	ineb: lenovo thinkpad x1 carbon - archwiki - arch linux: <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/lenovo_thinkpad_x1_carbon>
<ineb>	maybe?
<x1>	mmh?
<dynamicmetaflow>	anyone ever had a problem with touchpad and mouse scrolling and then you have to alt-tab to regain focus of your applications
<dynamicmetaflow>	no idea how to troubleshoot that
<x1>	dynamicmetaflow: is it a de?
<dynamicmetaflow>	yeah
<x1>	remember dimly there was an xfce fix
<dynamicmetaflow>	plasma
<dynamicmetaflow>	i thought it was my touchpad but apparently its also my external mouse
<d_garbage>	the forum is usually a good source for that kind of hardware problem. google  site search is handy especially if you tweak it with the date range filter.  site:bbs.archlinux.org <search>
<dynamicmetaflow>	d_garbage, !!!!!
<dynamicmetaflow>	hola!
<dynamicmetaflow>	yeah, i'm going to take a break and fix it later
<dynamicmetaflow>	i have to install some other applications and such
<dynamicmetaflow>	its minor but annoying so ill fix it last
<dynamicmetaflow>	d_garbage, thanks
<bshah>	umm sounds like window switching on mouse scroll?
<jeromelanteri>	for "--export" option of "yaourt", and then for just download my kernel source, the command is: "yaourt linux-headers --export /home/jerome" or "yaourt -sy linux-headers --export /home/jerome" ?
<dynamicmetaflow>	hmm
<dynamicmetaflow>	let me check that out
<d_garbage>	all the cool kids use cower
<arthur33>	jeromelanteri> you can just go to your home and yaourt -g linux
<arthur33>	it will download it where you are
<bshah>	dynamicmetaflow: right click on desktop -> mouse actions -> see if there is window switch or something
<jeromelanteri>	arthur33: you save my life... thanks again.
<d_garbage>	it's in man makepkg, which you read, right?
<bshah>	dynamicmetaflow: actually forgot one thing there..
<bshah>	rigtclick -> desktop settings -> mouse actions
<dan39>	ugh... the bane of my arch existance(after flash of course)... warning: linux: ignoring package upgrade (3.19.3-3 => 4.0.1-1)
<d_garbage>	what's the fuss?
<dan39>	and wtf why is middle click not pasting but going into some weird cursor mode
<arthur33>	dan39> using weechat ? :p
<dan39>	yes
<dan39>	this just changed, weechat didnt even upgrade
<arthur33>	you can shift-insert to paste
<dan39>	im so confused
<toqoz>	how do you change from column to list view in ncmpcpp?
<dan39>	i know, thats what i did
<arthur33>	ok
<dan39>	but i didnt have to 5 minutes ago
<d_garbage>	life is hard
<bshah>	dan39: alt+m
<demize>	dan39: alt-m
<arthur33>	dan39> in fact you can
<arthur33>	if you alt-m
<demize>	you turned mouse mode on.
<dan39>	success
<dynamicmetaflow>	bshah, i'm using plasma and i don't see mouse actions anywhere
<dan39>	maybe i accidentally did alt-m
<dynamicmetaflow>	checked under mouse input
<arthur33>	you'll see your mouse cursor becoming a i
<bshah>	dynamicmetaflow: are you using plasma 5, right?
<dan39>	life savers right there. thanks!
<dynamicmetaflow>	bshah, correct
<bshah>	dynamicmetaflow: its where you change your wallpaper..
<dynamicmetaflow>	oh...
<bshah>	dynamicmetaflow: right click on desktop or click on hamburger menu
<dynamicmetaflow>	yeah
<dynamicmetaflow>	i'm there
<dynamicmetaflow>	i made changes and only thing ther is right-button
<dynamicmetaflow>	standard menu
<bshah>	alright; do you see window switch selected there somewhere maybe?
<dynamicmetaflow>	nope
<toqoz>	found it, playlist_display_mode classic in the config, thought it would be a hotkey or something.
<dynamicmetaflow>	right button > standard menu
<bshah>	okay.. :(
<dynamicmetaflow>	i know :(
<dynamicmetaflow>	thanks though
<bshah>	no idea then..
<jpwhiting>	hey all, i recently downgraded from using testing to not using testing (removed the repo from pacman.conf), reinstalled all packages that are newer locally than after a pacman -syu
<dynamicmetaflow>	at least you helped me remember where mouse actions is
<dynamicmetaflow>	lol
<dynamicmetaflow>	very weird place for it to be imo
<jpwhiting>	and virtualbox machines won't start, vboxdrv complains about module_layout symbol
<d_garbage>	jpwhiting, -syuu to downgrade, you don't have to do it manually
<jpwhiting>	reinstalling virtualbox-host-modules doesn't seem to fix that, what package needs to be reinstalled to get workable vboxdrv and other kernel modules ?
<jpwhiting>	d_garbage: heh, good to know, thx
<guardian>	without exact eta, typically how long will it take for gcc 5.1 to move from testing to core?
<arthur33>	jpwhiting> you can switch to virtualbox-host-dkms
<guardian>	is it in weeks or months?
<dynamicmetaflow>	d_garbage: i would love to hear all the apps the cool kids use
<dynamicmetaflow>	:)
<arthur33>	and do a sudo dkms autoinstall -k kernel.version
<arthur33>	(usefull if you don't use latest kernel)
<jpwhiting>	arthur33: i thought dkms wasn't required when using the stable kernel
<bshah>	dynamicmetaflow: actually i am still not getting your problem completely.. maybe you can make some video or something?
<jpwhiting>	i do use the latest kernel though :)
<arthur33>	ah
<arthur33>	it's weird then
<arthur33>	did you reboot ?
<jpwhiting>	only downgraded to get away from gcc 5.1 (it broke my self-built kde when linking against packaged qt)
<d_garbage>	jpwhiting, it's one of those 'options' that's in the description rather than listed up front
<jpwhiting>	arthur33: of course
<d_garbage>	like -yy
<jpwhiting>	d_garbage: ah, right
<d_garbage>	dynamicmetaflow, mostly cower
<d_garbage>	dynamicmetaflow, and void linux
<dynamicmetaflow>	hmm ok! ^(-o_o-)^
<jpwhiting>	ah, my virtualbox-host-modules are newer than what's in the non testing repo, doh
<kinokoio>	sudo systemctl enable dkms && sudo systemctl start dkms
<tomty89>	anyone using the x builtin "modesetting" driver? i notice some strange thin tearing which appear only on the top part of the window/screen when i play video with mpv
<kinokoio>	automatically loads drivers if you have the kernel headers
<jpwhiting>	community/virtualbox-host-modules 4.3.26-6 [installed: 4.3.26-7] <-- pacman -syuu doesn't want to downgrade this
<dynamicmetaflow>	d_garbage: what is great about the void linux distribution
<dynamicmetaflow>	or different
<jpwhiting>	and pacman -s virtualbox-host-modules keeps reinstalling the too new one
<bshah>	jpwhiting: is communnity-testing enabled maybe/
<jpwhiting>	bshah: there it is, thanks, /me fixes
<bshah>	:d
<bshah>	np :)
<jpwhiting>	phew, much better, thanks a lot
<bshah>	i hit that snag in past.. :p
<jpwhiting>	now i can setup a lubuntu vm to investigate https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=347535 :)
<phrik>	title: bug 347535 – won't run - lubuntu 32 bit - won't load (at bugs.kde.org)
<clarjon1>	good morning, archlinuxland!
<jpwhiting>	never heard of lubuntu until yesterday
<bshah>	jpwhiting: crazy title.. :p
<jpwhiting>	heh, indeed
<jpwhiting>	bug is about kanagram not starting, not lubuntu itself :)
<bshah>	crazy bug triager like me would do resolved downstream.. ;p
<muchweb>	how long do you predict until proprietary "systemd plus" is released?
<arthur33>	muchweb> not very much
<jackdaniel>	first they have to fix the bugs :d
<arthur33>	jackdaniel> which bugs ?
<arthur33>	it's not bugs, it's new features™
<d_garbage>	shortly after all trolls disappear from the internet
<clarjon1>	heh
<bshah>	did someone mention our community? ;p
<muchweb>	>lesser gpl
<muchweb>	i see what you did there pottering
<dynamicmetaflow>	out if curiosity i like virtualization and such
<dynamicmetaflow>	anyone ever created a vhd ovm our of their current linux installation and run it under virtualbox
<dynamicmetaflow>	i used do this at my old job with windows and such
<dynamicmetaflow>	someone was having problems with virtualbox earlier right?
<arthur33>	dynamicmetaflow> yes jpwhiting
<dynamicmetaflow>	ah ok seems a bit more complicated than what i can help
<dynamicmetaflow>	just thought i could help since i just installed it and such
<dynamicmetaflow>	'
<arthur33>	just messup with *-testing repos iirc
<dynamicmetaflow>	does anyone use enthought canopy
<dynamicmetaflow>	i use it for python and wondering if i should reinstall it
<arthur33>	(i don't use it) why would you need to reinstall it ?
<dynamicmetaflow>	i mean install it in arch i had it previously when i used ubuntu
<arthur33>	ah
<dynamicmetaflow>	it has a nice package manager
<dynamicmetaflow>	it was kinda nice for libraries
<dynamicmetaflow>	and such
<dynamicmetaflow>	well gui based one i should say
<arthur33>	there is python2-ets in aur but i don't know if it's what you are looking for
<jpwhiting>	yeah, my mistake, forgot to disable all -testing repos, works fine now :)
<dynamicmetaflow>	ill check it out
<anthony25>	hi
<fzzy>	hello
<anthony25>	hi
<kinokoio>	hi
<toqoz>	any nice dark gtk themes?
<toqoz>	all the ones i try seem odd
<cpnl>	numix? :p
<anthony25>	i have a router on arch, virtualized in proxmox with kvm
<kinokoio>	ambiance dark blue (not black but dark (gtk2, gtk3))
<anthony25>	on linux lts 3.14 and 3.18, it freezes randomly
<kinokoio>	anthony25: freezes at resume after suspend?
<anthony25>	i've setup a gre tunnel, and if i use it with virtio enabled, the vm freezes after a big network activity into the tunel
<kinokoio>	do the vm write some kind of network log?
<anthony25>	hum nope, and only this vm freezes
<anthony25>	i have 10 other vm on arch, all with virtio, and they are running fine
<anthony25>	kinokoio: nope
<anthony25>	nothing in logs
<anthony25>	i tried to find the problem by checking in the kernel logs, but nothing special
<anthony25>	i was just wondering if anybody has this issue
<jeromelanteri>	d_garbage: maybe, i read it quickly (too much for sure)
<jeromelanteri>	anthony25: do you use pci passthrough ?
<anthony25>	jeromelanteri: nope
<toqoz>	cpnl: cant believe i havnt come across that earlier...
<anthony25>	with the network interface fully virtualized, i don't get these freezes
<anthony25>	but the thing weird is that every other vm are using virtio for their network interfaces, and my "lan" interface on my router uses virtio
<anthony25>	just the "public" interface, the one wired to my modem (so the one by where the gre tunnel pass), has the problem
<anthony25>	but this vm also have some (less frequent) random freezes
<anthony25>	i've done a full clean reinstallation, and same thing
<anthony25>	the only things running on it are bind, firewall with iptables (ferm), qos with tc, and radvd + dhcpd4/6
<kaligule1>	hi
<dynamicmetaflow>	hola
<teraflop>	holakase

<earnestly>	why not make it illegal to drive under the influence of nicotine?
<linux_dream>	hey guys i'm installing arch, i'm at the point of installing a de. do you recommend lxde for a lightweight de? (i am used to it), i doubt because it's been replaced by lxqt or so....
<d_garbage>	because of the tobacco lobby :p
<coolthingy500>	add coffee to the list.
<beest>	linux_dream: i recommend as everyone will, try a bunch of things and use what you like because we are not goddamned psychic <3
<sudokode>	coolthingy500: ever been really fucked on coffee?
<d_garbage>	linux_dream, wait you installed already? grats that was a quick progression
<coolthingy500>	caffine a drug right. make that illegal
<sudokode>	like super twitchy, you know you've had too much?
<demonicmaniac3>	sudokode: and the sweats
<earnestly>	sudokode: but it's not illegal to drive in that state
<linux_dream>	thanks d_garbage  .  well i haven't rebooted yet
<sudokode>	that's like being high, except instead of being faster to react, you're slower to react
<linux_dream>	but i installed and configured lots of stuff
<d_garbage>	i once drank so much coffee i was literally shaking :p
<sudokode>	although it depends on if it's heady or body
<d_garbage>	like about a pint of espresso
<d_garbage>	i don't recommend it
<sudokode>	earnestly: it should be
<sudokode>	:)
<demonicmaniac3>	vision gets all blurry too on too much coffee :p
<beest>	it should just be illegal to drive
<demonicmaniac3>	bloodshot eyes and focusing hard
<sudokode>	haha
<sudokode>	probably
<beest>	cars suck
<d_garbage>	self driving cars ftw
<coolthingy500>	don't people over 80 or so are not allowed to drive?
<sudokode>	driving is a transition between awesome look at how badass our metal is and whoa look how sweet our spaceships our
<d_garbage>	heh
<earnestly>	coolthingy500: they typically just have to retake the test
<sudokode>	driverless vehicles are about as realistic as gay marriage
<beest>	we should nuke the road system and become suddenly awash with the funding to build a personal smartrail system on all public roads
<d_garbage>	indeed
<sudokode>	it will happen and you better shut the fuck up if you disagree
<beest>	vote for me
<d_garbage>	yup
<coolthingy500>	sure
<earnestly>	driving is nice though :/
<lyonsb>	sudokode, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucezicqngju
<sudokode>	earnestly: yeah it is
<coolthingy500>	bring me a beer and i'll vote
<sudokode>	i love driving
<earnestly>	it's very relaxing
<sudokode>	i'm gonna hate the future
<d_garbage>	earnestly, well they'll still always have manual i reckon
<sudokode>	earnestly: oh i play some rap music
<lyonsb>	nope.
<d_garbage>	earnestly, for off-road
<coolthingy500>	why. because we don't have flying cars yet?
<sudokode>	i get angry when i drive
<earnestly>	i play nothing
<sudokode>	in a good way
<beest>	i am so not surprised by that
<sudokode>	but in a road ragey way
<earnestly>	anyway, future could be madmax
<sudokode>	but in a defensive way
<lyonsb>	all; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucezicqngju
<d_garbage>	coolthingy500, we do actually, they're just expensive
<sudokode>	but god i love driving
<beest>	see, that's good, if it's mad max then it's harder to hit someone when you're doing 120mph
<sudokode>	it's hard to replace
<sudokode>	being behind the wheel of a big machine for an extended period, going well over the speed that would kill you
<beest>	get some serrated spikes on your rims, you're golden
<d_garbage>	coolthingy500, the military was experimenting with flying jeeps not so long ago, they were working quite well but are still impractical
<sudokode>	beest: ever seen studded tires?
<sudokode>	no ofc you haven't. you've probably never seen snow
<beest>	i've put on studded tires
<earnestly>	snow tires?
<coolthingy500>	d_garbage, oh, that sucks.
<beest>	i once worked in a tire bay
<sudokode>	earnestly: they are a form of snow tire :p
<sudokode>	aside from tires without chains
<d_garbage>	coolthingy500, look at the way people drive and the traffic in cities, you want them to fly as well?!
<sudokode>	but yeah. they're fun
<sudokode>	also illegal in most places
<beest>	yup!
<coolthingy500>	to increase the death rates. yes!
<d_garbage>	um
<coolthingy500>	jk
<sudokode>	lol well they fuck up the roads
<sudokode>	it's more convenient to put on chains than pave roads
<beest>	they're metal, it's not really good for asphalt
<sudokode>	not for you, but for the state :p
<coolthingy500>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqj40kdwiq0
<coolthingy500>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wt7zm8xgxq
<coolthingy500>	at 50 second to a min the guy just gets fed up
<d_garbage>	um, i actually watched that first one but i have no idea why?
<sudokode>	nop
<sudokode>	e
<sudokode>	listening to imagine dragons
<sudokode>	fuck off
<sudokode>	radioactive
<d_garbage>	couple of minutues of some guy trying to be clever and just sounding like a smart arse?
<lyonsb>	more of the last and less of the first.
<beest>	wait, i'm on youtube?
<d_garbage>	lol
<coolthingy500>	well one day a women almost ran over a man when she was speeding downtown.
<coolthingy500>	though it's the fault of the guy for not looking
<d_garbage>	if you're going to make fun of people you need really to a) actually be funny and b) have that inclusive sense of humanity that says hey i'm really making fun of myself too because we're all just as bad and isn't life a funny old thing?
<earnestly>	coolthingy500: pedestrians kind of have the right of way, you have to make sure to not hit them
<earnestly>	(yes, even on roads)
<linux_dream>	hey guys, in the arch wiki i read: the lxde group from the official repositories contains the full desktop.        does this mean that pacman -syu (or -s) lxde   will install the complete de?
<tattoli>	also dont link to videos uploaded by people who have white power avatars on youtube lol
<d_garbage>	eew
<earnestly>	linux_dream: it will install the packages listed in the lxde group
<linux_dream>	thanks
<linux_dream>	perfect
<sudokode>	earnestly: well no, in crosswalks yes. pedestrians always have the right of way, barring extreme circumstance
<coolthingy500>	d_garbage, fair pont
<coolthingy500>	point
<sudokode>	because crosswalks are always (or should be) well lit, obvious, etc
<coolthingy500>	well. sadly in small towns. that's not the case. it's a very cheap town.
<sudokode>	anywhere else on the road, there are extraneous circumstances, and pedestrians are always expected to be aware of traffic because they are technically jaywalking, but legallyish
<sudokode>	depends on the area
<sudokode>	such as bad lighting. actually, in my state, if you're walking on a public highway past dusk, you are legally required to carry a light
<sudokode>	source
<earnestly>	sudokode: in the uk, even on roads
<sudokode>	cell phone, flash light, lighter, whatever
<ackt1c>	lightsaber
<sudokode>	bikes, reflectors, always required
<sudokode>	earnestly: yeah, it seems obvious
<thereapervirus>	exit
<sudokode>	but people don't do that. they just expect people to stop sometimes
<coolthingy500>	i carry a fenix pd35 light if i got to do some nightwalking.
<sudokode>	earnestly: highway meaning pretty much any public road
<sudokode>	it's a weird term my state likes to use
<sudokode>	they're not highways. they're one-lane nightmares. expand them you bastards
<sudokode>	eminent domain and previous ownership and the like
<sudokode>	it's really sketch around here
<sudokode>	two lanes would be fine if we weren't a resort area
<sudokode>	in the summer, omg the two-lane highways are insane. and there are 2 of them leading to the main town
<sudokode>	the other 2 are 4-lane, but even that isn't enough in the summer
<coolthingy500>	do you drive a motocycle or a car sudokode?
<sudokode>	neither
<sudokode>	this is delaware. i drive a truck :p
<earnestly>	sudokode: oh, pedestrians aren't allowed on motorways obviously
<beest>	it's the oscar mayer wienermobile
<sudokode>	earnestly: gotta cross somewhere :d
<earnestly>	but can be on dual carrage ways, same speed limit
<earnestly>	sudokode: bridges
<sudokode>	bridges no, unless there's a sidewalk
<sudokode>	common on bridges here
<sudokode>	sorta takes up the shoulder
<earnestly>	sudokode: on motorways, there are no sidewalks.  you're not allowed basically
<earnestly>	bridges to cross
<sudokode>	uh.. shoulder = side of road you pull over on
<earnestly>	you're not allowed to pull over on a shoulder either
<earnestly>	it's for emergency servicies
<beest>	britain is not america, roads are much narrower
<earnestly>	services*
<sudokode>	that's silly
<sudokode>	where do you pull over?
<sudokode>	nein not on ze autobon
<earnestly>	you don't :p
<sudokode>	lol
<sudokode>	yeah that's silly. we have these things called cell phones
<earnestly>	not on a motorway anyway
<sudokode>	we prefer it if people don't talk on them while driving
<sudokode>	so shoulders mostly make up that now
<earnestly>	oh, if you have to stop and have no choice and need to use the emergency phones, then you kind of have no choice
<sudokode>	plus disabled vehicles
<sudokode>	emergency vehicles always have the right of way
<earnestly>	sudokode: it's not just having right of way, it's also about you being out of the way :p
<sudokode>	if they come up on you, you have to either move right, pull over, slow down, or just be cautious to let them pass
<sudokode>	earnestly: which is the point of that ^
<sudokode>	which is how right of way works where there are no obvious traffic directions
<sudokode>	i.e. stop signs :p
<earnestly>	round abouts \o/
<earnestly>	roundabouts* even
<sudokode>	we need more
<earnestly>	great for low to medium traffic
<sudokode>	i drive on 1-2 regularly
<sudokode>	and people are so confused by them
<earnestly>	need traffic lights for high density traffic
<sudokode>	no you don't
<earnestly>	yeah, you do
<sudokode>	roundabouts are fine there too
<sudokode>	no you don't
<beest>	it's awful, the reason there aren't more roundabouts in america is because americans can't drive on them :(
<sudokode>	it's awesome
<sudokode>	well, you really do
<sudokode>	but honestly you can get away with a well thought out roundabout :p
<evrardjp>	there exists large roundabouts you know ?
<sudokode>	yeah
<sudokode>	especially in the uk
<beest>	and magic ones
<oats>	the closest largish roundabout i know of is a 3.5 hour drive away
<earnestly>	sudokode: well, i've driven hundreds of them, and in high density traffic you need traffic lights around it.
<earnestly>	otherwise it dead locks
<earnestly>	believe what you want otherwise
<sudokode>	deadlocks are impossible with humans
<evrardjp>	i've never seen a block in a roundabout itself
<sudokode>	you will get out of it
<sudokode>	it just has to be done
<sudokode>	someone will eventually be like... i need some fuckin white castle
<sudokode>	that's end of deadlock
<earnestly>	evrardjp: i have, when the traffic lights didn't work :p
<matty_r>	 is there a keyboard shortcut to make a program fullscreen?
<keenerd>	sudokode: http://clubsmartcar.com/uploads/monthly_11_2010/post-6582-1290913155.jpg
<sudokode>	oh god
<matty_r>	couldn't see any in the standard shortcuts
<sudokode>	keenerd: abandon vehicle
<sudokode>	problem solved
<sudokode>	didn't need that hunk of metal anyway
<sudokode>	mmm slider
<earnestly>	basically when you have constant traffic the give-way model starts to fall apart when everyone arrives at the same time.  you just have quickly changing lights to keep it going
<evrardjp>	i've seen a block on one of the exits, but that's another problem: stupid people and bad traffic network architecture :p
<earnestly>	sudokode: http://i.imgur.com/sdxnqjd.jpg
<linux_dream>	hmm guys i have a problem. i followed the beginner's guide to install arch. i did everything, up to installing grub, generating the fstab, etc.  i even installed lxde.  when i rebooted i see no grub menu, instead, it boots windows
<sudokode>	earnestly: http://www.kitchenproject.com/history/sliders/white-castle-slyders.jpg
<sudokode>	why do you need that car again?
<sudokode>	you can't eat it :p
<linux_dream>	so i'm back on my flash drive with the arch.iso again.
<linux_dream>	i don't know why i don't get the grub menu
<coolthingy500>	do you have win8?
<coolthingy500>	or 7?
<linux_dream>	i noted every commands i typed.   yes i have win 8.1
<coolthingy500>	did you create a efi partion
<evrardjp>	earnestly: nice picture of morons :p
<linux_dream>	i've got all the commands i typed on a notebook close to me
<linux_dream>	no because there was alredy an efi partition, but i did mounted it coolthingy500
<evrardjp>	sudokode: i wanna eat hotdogs now
<ackt1c>	what's the best font pkg for windows like fonts in a web browser?
<sudokode>	earnestly: i had the best hot dog earlier
<sudokode>	er evrardjp
<sudokode>	mac & cheese and jumbo lump crab meat
<evrardjp>	nice :)
<sudokode>	oh boy. matt twilley's baltimore dog
<coolthingy500>	did you disable fast boot and secure boot
<coolthingy500>	?
<sudokode>	<3
<linux_dream>	yes coolthingy500
<evrardjp>	you installed grub or refiboot?
<linux_dream>	grub and efibootmgr
<coolthingy500>	did you install a display server?
<evrardjp>	gummiboot*
<earnestly>	sudokode: https://hsudarren.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/rothsman-roundabout.jpg
<linux_dream>	hmm display server, i am not sure about it
<coolthingy500>	i made that mistake with arch once.
<sudokode>	earnestly: when normal traffic logic breaks down...
<evrardjp>	i don't know if it's me but it looks like a watch
<sudokode>	oh god
<linux_dream>	can you give an example of a display sever coolthingy500 ?
<coolthingy500>	sorry i mean display manager
<linux_dream>	i can't find it in the beginner's guide
<coolthingy500>	like lightdm
<earnestly>	sudokode: it just don't work in high density, you just have fairly quick traffic lights, a feew of them all around the circuit
<coolthingy500>	lxde
<linux_dream>	lxde yes
<earnestly>	sudokode: then it's fine again
<coolthingy500>	http://i.imgur.com/sdxnqjd.jpg
<sudokode>	earnestly: again, i would then abandon my vehicle
<coolthingy500>	ahh
<sudokode>	go to the nearest burger joint, order a giant meal
<coolthingy500>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/display_manager
<phrik>	title: display manager - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<sudokode>	probably feed a few other people
<sudokode>	then file an uninsured driver claim with my insurance company
<linux_dream>	but coolthingy500 wouldn't that be useful once i can at least choose arch to boot?
<sudokode>	"uhhh... multiple fucking bricks... i dunno. something hit me"
<ackt1c>	plasma is pretty cool
<linux_dream>	if i can't even choose arch i don't see how that would help
<sudokode>	a giant tank destroyed me
<d_garbage>	linux_dream, sounds like you didn't do the bootloader quite right

<linux_dream>	yes yurikoles
<yurikoles>	sounds interesting
<yurikoles>	maybe it is wrong paritiion?
<linux_dream>	looks like i've got to redo all the steps
<yurikoles>	do you have a separate /usr?
<yurikoles>	did you mounted all ?
<linux_dream>	yeah i mounted all
<coolthingy500>	did you unmounted after installing?
<jusss>	mplayer-vaapi is removed from official source ?
<linux_dream>	yes i unmounted because i had to reboot
<linux_dream>	i'll reinstall grub, no big deal
<jusss>	after this update, i found mplayer-vaapi doesn't work ,
<linux_dream>	oh well even the wifi isn't set.  i've got to redo the whole installation process
<holomorph>	what about mpv
<linux_dream>	uh i can't enable wifi, it says "please install dialog"  but without internet it's going to be tough
<coolthingy500>	ya. around the installing process you got to set up your network manager.
<linux_dream>	i know i had it done the 1st time
<wolfspirit33>	linux_dream connect via ethernet
<linux_dream>	i typed wifi-menu and selected my wifi
<linux_dream>	it worked great, now it asks me to install dialog
<wolfspirit33>	and do pacman -s dialog
<wolfspirit33>	it will ask you for another package after that
<linux_dream>	i don't have ethernet cable
<coolthingy500>	it's hard to remember sometimes. i going though a list.
<linux_dream>	i made a list of all the commands i typed.  :)
<linux_dream>	now redoing them doesn't even work :/
<wolfspirit33>	you have to install the dialog package for it to work
<wolfspirit33>	boot into the livecd and connect to the internet
<coolthingy500>	you might have to redo the whole thing over again. took me 4 tries to get it right.
<wolfspirit33>	then chroot into your install
<wolfspirit33>	then install dialog
<linux_dream>	i am in the live cd wolfspirit33
<wolfspirit33>	linux_dream is this before or after your installation?
<linux_dream>	right now?  after
<wolfspirit33>	how did you download all the packages during install?
<linux_dream>	i rebooted thinking it would work but grub menu didn't show up
<linux_dream>	i had wifi
<linux_dream>	wifi-menu worked
<wolfspirit33>	okay so
<linux_dream>	i wasn't asked to download dialog
<linux_dream>	but now i am
<linux_dream>	ok i think  i know why
<linux_dream>	i should enable wifi as soon as i boot into the live iso and then do arch-chroot
<linux_dream>	not the other way around
<wolfspirit33>	yes
<wolfspirit33>	then from there you can install dialog
<linux_dream>	ok time to reboot then?  or can i bypass the problem without rebooting?
<linux_dream>	ok
<wolfspirit33>	just type exit
<wolfspirit33>	and do wifi-menu
<wolfspirit33>	then connect and chroot
<linux_dream>	thanks works
<linux_dream>	ok i installed dialog
<coolthingy500>	do you plan to use a different de/wm aside from lxde?
<linux_dream>	later yes but not for now
<linux_dream>	now i just want to boot into arch with lxde
<wolfspirit33>	now try wifi-menu again
<wolfspirit33>	it will ask for one more package
<geosmin>	so i'm eyeing the t420s thinkpad, but wondering if the hybrid (intel/nvidia) gpu will give me trouble
<linux_dream>	true wolfspirit33 . i'm going to install it
<coolthingy500>	stick with the intel model geosmin i have that laptop with fedora 21
<linux_dream>	done wolfspirit33
<wolfspirit33>	= )
<geosmin>	coolthingy500: i'd like to do some gaming once in a while
<wolfspirit33>	now it should work when you boot into it and try wifi-menu
<linux_dream>	it still doesn't recognize grub
<linux_dream>	as if i hadn't installed it
<geosmin>	coolthingy500: currently reading up on bumblebee
<coolthingy500>	the nvidia back then had some issues geosmin i don't know if it's been resolved yet.
<geosmin>	coolthingy500: ah
<coolthingy500>	i might have been fixed though.
<wolfspirit33>	linux_dream does grub give you an error message?
<linux_dream>	i don't know whether i should redo the pacstrap command either
<geosmin>	coolthingy500: well it's been nearly half a decade since release :0
<geosmin>	:)*
<geosmin>	one can hope
<linux_dream>	it says that grub isn't recognized wolfspirit33
<coolthingy500>	geosmin, nvidia has been working on their drivers for linux, and it's been good so far. can't say for ati though.
<wolfspirit33>	linux-dream: pacman -s grub os-prober
<linux_dream>	no i shouldn't get os-prober
<linux_dream>	i want to dual boot with uefi win 8.1
<linux_dream>	i must follow https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/grub#installation_2
<phrik>	title: grub - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<coolthingy500>	what do you need windows for?
<linux_dream>	ok i tried pacman -s grub and it says reinstalling?   so it recognizes i already have it
<oraclexzf>	to fit in with society
<yurikoles>	oh lol
<gnea>	what if society is the problem?
<coolthingy500>	why do i care about fitting in.
<linux_dream>	but i still get grub: command not found
<wolfspirit33>	it dosent work like that
<geosmin>	how's nouveau 3d performance vs nvidia?
<gnea>	nvidia > nouveau
<coolthingy500>	no clue. i
<coolthingy500>	m only using the open drivers on a 2008 asus m70vn laptop
<linux_dream>	can someone help me? i have grub installed but grub isn't recognized...
<geosmin>	probably depends, as i've found the oss drivers outperform catalyst on older cards
<gnea>	linux_dream: how can you confirm that it is installed?
<linux_dream>	pacman -s grub tells me it's installed
<wolfspirit33>	linux_dream: pacman -s efibootmgr
<coolthingy500>	pacman -qi grub
<linux_dream>	i have it too wolfspirit33
<coolthingy500>	if it doesn't show. you don't have it
<linux_dream>	both programs are installed but not recognized
<gnea>	linux_dream: what do you mean, 'not recognized'?
<linux_dream>	it shows up coolthingy500
<coolthingy500>	then you have it installed.
<linux_dream>	gnea, i enter a command (grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=$esp --bootloader-id=grub --recheck) and i get grub: command not found
<geosmin>	coolthingy500: thoughts on the t420s?
<gnea>	linux_dream: as root?
<coolthingy500>	geosmin, well every distro i tried works with no hassle. even arch and debian
<linux_dream>	yes gnea
<gnea>	linux_dream: using which shell?
<linux_dream>	as root in the arch.iso live device
<linux_dream>	bash
<gnea>	oh, it's a livecd?
<linux_dream>	it worked before i rebooted
<linux_dream>	yes
<gnea>	so you can't actually write to it?
<linux_dream>	i am trying to install arch
<gnea>	okay
<linux_dream>	right, i write on my hard disk
<linux_dream>	i rebooted thinking i would have grub and choose arch but instead it auto booted into windows, no grub menu
<gnea>	are you following the installation guide?
<coolthingy500>	maybe this might help https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=195340
<phrik>	title: dual boot doesn't work [solved] / installation / arch linux forums (at bbs.archlinux.org)
<linux_dream>	i had gooffed somewhere and when i reinserted the usb stick, looks like grub isn't recognized
<gnea>	also, what type of system is it? using bios or uefi?
<linux_dream>	uefi
<wolfspirit33>	linux_dream try changing your boot priorities in bios
<linux_dream>	yes gnea
<wolfspirit33>	seems like you've done this all already
<linux_dream>	the beginners's guide but i'll follow https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/grub#installation_2  once grub works
<phrik>	title: grub - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<linux_dream>	i did that already wolfspirit33
<coolthingy500>	somewere along the lines. that person had the same efi partition for both win 8 and arch
<linux_dream>	yes
<linux_dream>	i mounted it
<gnea>	linux_dream: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/grub#uefi_systems  are you using this guide?
<phrik>	title: grub - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<linux_dream>	i found the soluition!!!
<ackt1c>	cool
<gnea>	oh awesome
<linux_dream>	i had to remake the cfg file with grub i think
<linux_dream>	grub worked at least
<coolthingy500>	where did you find that solution?
<yurikoles>	as i said
<linux_dream>	alone
<linux_dream>	just redid the command ih ad done
<yurikoles>	grub-mkconfig after installing grub
<linux_dream>	wait the command # grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=$esp --bootloader-id=grub --recheck    returns failed to get canonical path of 'udev'
<linux_dream>	and reinstalling grub on /dev/sda  returns:  error: cannot find efi directory
<gnea>	so it's still failing?
<linux_dream>	but i did mkdir -p -mnt/boot/efi   and mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot/efi
<linux_dream>	yes
<gnea>	hmm
<gnea>	make sure you're following that guide
<coolthingy500>	did you change your boot order linux_dream?
<linux_dream>	no i didn't
<linux_dream>	well it looks like i must redo the pacstrap command
<coolthingy500>	http://postimg.org/image/rhb055wez/
<phrik>	title: view image: 2015 03 28 22 58 33 (at postimg.org)
<linux_dream>	some commands i had done doen't work anymore
<coolthingy500>	you might have to depending on your setup. learn this the hard way with someones asus desktop
<myrrlyn>	have any of you guys played with enlightenment's entrance display manager in depth
<coolthingy500>	only a little. display server on my arch setup crashed. i raged, and redo a setup with xfce with a alternative way of installing arch because i don't want to mess around the second time.
<linux_dream>	hmm i'm kinda lost, even the pacstrap command doesn't work now
<coolthingy500>	what's your setup specs?
<coolthingy500>	linux_dream
<linux_dream>	is there a command that i can enter to display it?
<coolthingy500>	install inxi on pacman
<se7enelv1>	anybody an idea howto install thunderbird 38 or higher? i tried thunderbird-earlybird and nightly but both do not build
<linux_dream>	well basically it's an hp pavilion 360
<linux_dream>	a laptop
<coolthingy500>	and type in inxi -fxz
<linux_dream>	i can't copy and paste here
<coolthingy500>	just list the important specs.
<flank>	hey guys. i mistakenly clicked "unify displays" in kde display configuration. now, my screens don't display correctly and i can't undo. anyone use this before or know where to look?
<lyonsb>	sweet sweet recovery.
<linux_dream>	4 gb of ram, intel celeron n2840
<flank>	oh gawd. you have to click the display graphics.... sigh..
<se7enelv1>	failed to verify thunderbird-earlybird integrity
<ginseng>	hello how do i restart x?

<phrik>	title: uefi - how do i get my hp laptop to boot into grub from my new efi file? - ask ubuntu (at askubuntu.com)
<coolthingy500>	hps are known to have issues with duelbooting distros. not just arch
<evrardjp>	i don't have any problem
<evrardjp>	i'm not using grub though
<coolthingy500>	it depends on your set up. and if you plan to duel boot wins
<myrrlyn>	oh, moron refind question
<myrrlyn>	refind on this machine didn't automatically set up the arch icon for the boot option
<myrrlyn>	how do i... nevermind, found it
<yurikoles>	geinseng
<yurikoles>	what display manager do you use
<yurikoles>	in most cases you need to restart service of your display manger
<linux_dream>	ok i understand my problem
<coolthingy500>	oh ya. otherwise you stay in tty
<edit>	helo --
<edit>	hello
<linux_dream>	some stuff like pacstrap only work when i type "exit" and others only work with arch-chroot
<coolthingy500>	damn it. brb
<linux_dream>	so i am in big troubles
<edit>	?
<evrardjp>	can anyone help me troubleshoot my issue between gnome-keyring and my ssh connections? ssh <somehost> ask my key private in the terminal instead of unlocking the key automatically upon login (or even manually, it doesn't seem to take the gnome agent at all)
<evrardjp>	ask my private key's password*
<evrardjp>	sometimes it works though
<linux_dream>	ok i'm making progress but i get grub-install: error: failed to get canonical path of 'dev' when i enter # grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=$esp --bootloader-id=grub --recheck
<linux_dream>	any idea what does this mean?
<yurikoles>	echo $esp?
<linux_dream>	ok i get it thanks :) i mean i know the error
<linux_dream>	worked
<yurikoles>	lo
<yurikoles>	lol
<yurikoles>	i was asking echo $esp 20 minutes ago
<linux_dream>	generating the grub conf file shows only memtest
<linux_dream>	no sign of arch
<linux_dream>	i guess i shouldn't reboot
<yurikoles>	ls /boot ?
<linux_dream>	efi grub memtest86+ syslinux
<linux_dream>	nevermin di know my mistake
<linux_dream>	"the --bootloader-id is what appears in the boot options to identity the grub efi boot option; make sure this is something you will recognize later."  how do i get to see the boot options?
<yurikoles>	you have no kernels in /boot
<yurikoles>	did you mounted /boot?
<linux_dream>	i don't have /boot i have only / and it's mounted
<yurikoles>	ok
<yurikoles>	pacman -s linux
<yurikoles>	seems like you have no kernels installed
<linux_dream>	should i be in arch-chroot or not?
<yurikoles>	yes
<linux_dream>	uname -a return 4.0.1-1
<linux_dream>	just saying
<yurikoles>	i mean in arch installation
<linux_dream>	well i did mkinitcpio -p linux
<yurikoles>	in installation or livecd?
<linux_dream>	live cd
<yurikoles>	are you joking?
<yurikoles>	you need to this in arch shell
<yurikoles>	of the installation
<yurikoles>	arch-chroot /mnt
<yurikoles>	and then ls /boot
<linux_dream>	i can't chroot anymore it tells me udev is already mounted on /mnt/dev
<linux_dream>	but i am in root i guess it's the same
<linux_dream>	ls /boot shows the same as before: efi grub memtest86+ and syslinux
<linux_dream>	can't use pacman there... ouch
<linux_dream>	i'm so lost i don't understand what's going on
<linux_dream>	so pacman -s linux doesn't work for now
<linux_dream>	chroot doesn't work
<linux_dream>	can't unmount /mnt either
<linux_dream>	how do i proceed
<linux_dream>	yurikoles, are y9u here?
<bushido_>	linux_dream: trying to install grub?
<linux_dream>	i have rebooted and now chrooted
<yurikoles>	why do you unmount /mn ?
<linux_dream>	yurikoles, , ls /boot shows now: efi grub initramfs-linux-fallback.img initramfs-linux.img and vmlinuz-linux
<linux_dream>	i rebooted
<bushido_>	rm -fr * that dir
<yurikoles>	yes
<bushido_>	sudo pacman -s linux
<yurikoles>	of course
<bushido_>	then install the grub
<bushido_>	also first check your fstab
<linux_dream>	ok thanks guys
<bushido_>	rm it
<bushido_>	gen new one
<yurikoles>	why to reinstall everything?
<yurikoles>	also
<linux_dream>	bushido i am in the arch.iso via usb, trying to install arch
<linux_dream>	i did pacman -s linux, now installing
<linux_dream>	done
<yurikoles>	grub-install
<yurikoles>	grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub
<yurikoles>	mount |grep efi
<linux_dream>	grub-install: error: cannot find efi directory
<yurikoles>	did you mount the
<yurikoles>	oh shi
<yurikoles>	bushido
<linux_dream>	i did grub-install /dev/sda
<yurikoles>	mkdir /boot/efi
<lyonsb>	too many cooks in the kitchen.
<yurikoles>	do you have a fat partition for efi?
<linux_dream>	yes
<linux_dream>	mount /dev/sda2 /boot/efi
<lyonsb>	linux_dream, weren't you using your $esp as /boot before?
<linux_dream>	no the esp is the one from arch wiki
<lyonsb>	k
<linux_dream>	since i can't copy and paste from my hardware i pasted the arch wiki
<linux_dream>	cannot create /boot/efi, already exists so i just mount it now i guess
<evrardjp>	quick question (that won't help): why do you want grub and efi?
<linux_dream>	installing grub now!
<evrardjp>	ok :)
<evrardjp>	as you wish
<linux_dream>	coz i have win 8.1 aside arch
<linux_dream>	ok i did grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg  yurikoles
<evrardjp>	gummiboot works for that
<linux_dream>	now what? reboot?
<evrardjp>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/gummiboot
<phrik>	title: gummiboot - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<linux_dream>	now apparently i have to type: # grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=$esp --bootloader-id=grub --boot-directory=$esp --recheck --debug    but i don't know wht to put for id
<yurikoles>	id is just for you
<halfwit>	linux_dream: still fighting?
<yurikoles>	grub-install after mounting /boot/efi
<yurikoles>	and it is not required to run such long command
<yurikoles>	just grub-install
<linux_dream>	ok command worked (the big one)  yes halfwit
<linux_dream>	ok
<halfwit>	linux_dream: best of luck, heh.
<linux_dream>	generating grub file recognizes linux image
<linux_dream>	initrd image and fallack initrfamfs image
<yurikoles>	and grub is installed without errors?
<linux_dream>	yes
<yurikoles>	so reboot
<linux_dream>	no error reported
<linux_dream>	reboot and remove flash drive right?
<yurikoles>	yes
<linux_dream>	thx
<yurikoles>	try it
<bushido_>	linux_dream: you need fat32 partition .. 100m
<linux_dream>	no grub..... it's booting windows
<bushido_>	that will you edp partition
<bushido_>	esp *
<bushido_>	you need grub
<linux_dream>	i have it already bushido
<ackt1c>	hi bushido
<halfwit>	did you ever make the config
<linux_dream>	yes i did
<linux_dream>	it recognized linux
<bushido_>	do you have the efi partition?
<se7enelv1>	anybody an idea howto install thunderbird 38 or higher? i tried thunderbird-earlybird and nightly but both do not build
<linux_dream>	yes bushido
<bushido_>	install grub on it?
<linux_dream>	yes
<ackt1c>	se7enelv1: download the tarball, makepkg -s, pacman -u *.xz
<bushido_>	with grub.cfg too
<ackt1c>	tarball from the aur
<linux_dream>	i reboot again, still booting windows, no sign of grub
<bushido_>	hey ackt1c
<ruukasu>	every variable shown in `locale` is en_us.utf-8, yet lots of unicode characters show up as ascii (e.g. vowels with diacritics). how might i fix this?
<gnea>	okay, i'm trying to install some packages from aur and getting the following errors: error: failed to commit transaction (conflicting files)
<gnea>	fwsnort: /usr/sbin exists in filesystem
<gnea>	and i see that /usr/sbin is now a symlink to /usr/bin (why?!)
<halfwit>	moar fonts?
<linux_dream>	so what do i do now?
<linux_dream>	i installed linux on my machine but can't boot it.
<gnea>	 /sbin is also linked to /usr/bin  so i don't understand what i should do? i know i can --force it, but that seems a bit extreme
<gnea>	linux_dream: if you go into your uefi bios at boottime, can you isolate the linux boot partition and boot from it there?
<halfwit>	isn't it that it doesn't matter about the partition order for efi, or am i incorrect?
<bushido_>	linux_dream: grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi/ --bootloader-id=grub --boot-directory=/boot/ /dev/sdx --recheck --debug
<linux_dream>	i am in the bios can't see linux there
<halfwit>	you won't
<halfwit>	it'll show the disk on which you installed the bootleader onto
<halfwit>	loader *
<gnea>	right
<halfwit>	and that is the one that you want to boot from
<gnea>	in theory, it should anyway
<halfwit>	(for sanity, we like to keep that as sda, whenever it's possible)
<linux_dream>	bushido i did that command already
<gnea>	(who wants to be sane?)
<halfwit>	(sudokode)
<gnea>	(oh.)
<linux_dream>	i think i'm done for today, been there from 7 pm tp 2 am, arch still not installed
<linux_dream>	time to sleep
<gnea>	okay, good luck tomorrow
<linux_dream>	thanks, not sure i'll have time tomorrow
<halfwit>	heh. i should drunk-arch more. i have all the answers!
<bushido_>	linux_dream: then mkconfig -o /boot/efi/efi/grub/grub.cfg
<linux_dream>	i did that too bushiod
<bushido_>	check path correctly beofre entering
<linux_dream>	when i did that command it recognized linux
<gnea>	hrmmmm
<gnea>	grep '^s\?bin/\|usr/sbin' /var/lib/pacman/local/*/files | cut -d ":" -f 1 | uniq | cut -d "/" -f 6
<gnea>	filesystem-2015.02-1
<gnea>	psad-2.4.1-1
<linux_dream>	c u tomorrow
<gnea>	weird. i install psad earlier, and that was when all of this craziness started
<gnea>	maybe it has a bad pkgbuild
<halfwit>	i must have missed the brunt of that.
<edit>	:o
<halfwit>	brundt?
<halfwit>	nvm.
<dacoit>	:p
<ackt1c>	edit msg?
<halfwit>	sudokode:
<edit>	to install, linux-lts 3.14.41-1  would i just do, pacman -s linux-lts
<edit>	or, sudo pacman -s linux-lts && grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
<gnea>	edit: the former. it should update grub for you.
<edit>	anything else needed >?
<gnea>	nafaik
<edit>	former ?
<gnea>	you said 'or'
<gnea>	therefore, whatever the first option was
<doctormooch>	how is everyone doing today/tonight?
<ackt1c>	oh
<edit>	:) ok
<gnea>	doctormooch: ready to throw hard drives through my window, you? :)
<edit>	hmm, same output
<ackt1c>	what's the command to rebuild linux
<doctormooch>	not too bad! actually just testing out this new irc client (weechat)
<ackt1c>	irssi is better
<gnea>	aah
<doctormooch>	new to me that is
<gnea>	i'm an irssi fan myself
<edit>	i use, weechat
<doctormooch>	interesting, ill go check it out
<doctormooch>	terminal based? or graphical?
<gnea>	have never used weechat, so don't really have a strong opinion of it
<edit>	i use to use, irssi
<ackt1c>	terminal
<gnea>	terminal
<ackt1c>	screen + irssi = best
<ackt1c>	weechat seemed alright
<doctormooch>	im going to go check it out, thanks for the reccomendation!
<edit>	st - tmux - weechat
<gnea>	anytime
<gnea>	ackt1c: rebuilt?
<edit>	or whatever terminal
<gnea>	urxvt - zsh - screen - irssi
<ackt1c>	what do you mean rebuilt?
<gnea>	i meant rebuild
<edit>	nice, gnea
<ackt1c>	oh
<ackt1c>	i see what you did there
<gnea>	yes, there was an 'f' in the way :)
<edit>	weird, same out put on both commands
<gnea>	ugh, why does this error have to persist?
<gnea>	error: failed to commit transaction (conflicting files
<nixnerd>	bushido_: seen this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksxidrss3di
<doctormooch>	alright, lets see this irssi :)
<tigrmesh>	hi doctormooch
<ruukasu>	every variable shown in `locale` is en_us.utf-8, yet lots of unicode characters show up as ascii (e.g. vowels with diacritics). how might i fix this?
<vdg>	reading http://www.slimroms.net/index.php/slim-bean-features
<phrik>	title: slimroms features (at www.slimroms.net)
<vdg>	shit, sorry
<yurikoles>	weechat is very friendly
<yurikoles>	sudo update-initramfs -u
<yurikoles>	oh shi
<yurikoles>	 you can not write text in this buffer
<yurikoles>	first that i see after installing
<yurikoles>	*after trying to do something
<dacoit>	!tumbleweed2
<phrik>	...@ ...@ ...@
<nixnerd>	trying to connect to remote machine via ssh. nothing happens. it just times out.
<ackt1c>	did you start sshd
<nixnerd>	sshd has been enabled and started on remote machine.
<dacoit>	ssh in and start sshd
<dacoit>	:p
<ackt1c>	port 23?
<ackt1c>	or 21 i forget
<dacoit>	22
<nixnerd>	port 22
<dacoit>	0/2
<ackt1c>	oops
<nixnerd>	the sshd config is bone stock
<dacoit>	is the computer behind a nat or exposed directly
<nixnerd>	this is where i'm a little confused as i'm not a networking guy. it's connected to a router. that's all i know.
<nixnerd>	does that have a built in nat maybe?
<gnea>	nixnerd: it's possible that the router is denying traffic between connected devices
<dacoit>	okay, then there is nat'ing going on probably. meaning the router has to be told to allow 22 from outside reach the computer
<nixnerd>	shit. ok. probably not going to happen tonight.
<gnea>	if you know the router's password, it could probably be fixed within 5 minutes
<dacoit>	are you trying to ssh the public ip then, i assume, correct?
<dacoit>	gnea: most block external by default
<gnea>	dacoit: well yeah, but even nat can block internally as well
<dacoit>	admin access that is
<nixnerd>	not the public ip the xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx one
<dacoit>	but yeah
<gnea>	i kinda walked in on this conversation halfway through
<foolsrun>	does anyone know why xmodmap would be not working on first boot, but if i kill x and let it restart xmodmap works?
<dacoit>	that looks like an ip to me. do you mean the 192.x or 10.x subnet ip, rather than the ff:ff:ff:ff ip?
<dacoit>	well they all have 0
<nixnerd>	uhhh... it's this: xx.xxx.xx.xxx
<dacoit>	thats confusing language, let me try again.
<nixnerd>	obviously numbers have been replaced with x
<sinshiva>	lol
<nixnerd>	it doesn't start with either 192 or 10
<dacoit>	then its probably the public ip. meaning the router has to be told which ports to forward, like 22
<nixnerd>	but i think i need to forward the ports
<nixnerd>	yeah... that's what i need to do.
<nixnerd>	i'll look into that
<nixnerd>	tomorrow
<nixnerd>	thanks all.
<nixnerd>	have a great night.
<yurikoles>	oh shi http://phoxbox.tumblr.com/post/50920606572/the-arch-linux-way-cover-it-up
<phrik>	title: bit bucket (at phoxbox.tumblr.com)
<yurikoles>	the arch linux way: cover it up!
<yurikoles>	so arch's leader has been hacked at least twice?
<tigrmesh>	look at the dates on those
<coolthingy500>	this is almost the same issue that the owner of silkroad has done.
<yurikoles>	2013, and so?
<yurikoles>	it was two years ago
<scimmia>	and who cares?
<coolthingy500>	well i know we all make dumb mistakes. this is kinda of a surprise to see that though.
<dacoit>	this is seriouz bizness scimmia
<gehidore>	so it's all pretty moot.
<dacoit>	it would be moot regardless
<gehidore>	but as scimmia ... who cares...
<scimmia>	when was the last time any of you saw a package by phrakture?
<coolthingy500>	never.
<coolthingy500>	the most packages i've seen that i know of is from allen
<scimmia>	so if he's not making packages, it's got no bearing on your system at all. nothing to see here, move along
<yurikoles>	iamrohit7: this channel is for ubuntu, for debian support please join #debian
<coolthingy500>	it's just surprising. most people if you connect something to the net, you don't run root entirely
<dacoit>	lol
<coolthingy500>	but hey, to earch their own
<dacoit>	yurikoles: no u
<coolthingy500>	same reason i don't root my phones
<yurikoles>	sorry, wrong channel :)
<yurikoles>	the problem is not in rooting, but in wiping of evidence on forum
<scimmia>	yurikoles, there is a 14 page long thread on the forum about him being hacked, so...
<yurikoles>	source?
<yurikoles>	what happened with second thread?
<scimmia>	https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=12192
<scimmia>	second thread most likely got merged
<scimmia>	threads never get deleted on the forum, they are merged or moved to the dustbin
<scimmia>	the guy on that blog post is just an idiot. he was also complaining about package signing when arch had signed packages in place for a long time
<sternmull>	my keyboard is dead when i wake up from "systemctl suspend" by pressing a key. when i wake up by pressing the power button everything is fine. any ideas how to fix that?
<yurikoles>	also, most of actors and other artists are gays
<yurikoles>	so no problem to listen the music created by gay or watching an gay actor playing in good movie
<yurikoles>	also
<yurikoles>	!turing
<phrik>	we are not interested in the fact that the brain has the consistency of cold porridge…
<scimmia>	wow yurikoles, you're really going off the rails now
<scimmia>	anyway
<scimmia>	!gn
<phrik>	good night to all from scimmia!
<kevr>	that's a huge assumption, lol
<kevr>	most of my friends are artists and indy film makers and they're straight
<kevr>	most of them have girlfriends
<tom^>	what has this todo with anything?
<tom^>	no one cares if artists are gay besides morons.
<kevr>	i'm not sure, i was just responding to yurikoles.
<kevr>	mybad.
<kevr>	s/bad/ bad/
<arch-tk>	alright, final verdict: game of thrones (the tv series) is alright. but, by no means does it have the level of storytelling detail as the books do.
<arch-tk>	simply put, game of thrones and a song of ice and fire are not very alike.
<dacoit>	in other news, the sun is hot
<dacoit>	:p
<yurikoles>	for example john travolta is gay
<arch-tk>	anyone else here interested in an ncurses kodi remote?
<dacoit>	is kodi xbmc?
<arch-tk>	dacoit: xbmc is kodi
<tom^>	arch-tk: not a android remote?
<arch-tk>	tom^: no, this is a remote written in ncurses
<tom^>	;_;
<arch-tk>	i mean, written in python using "curses"
<arch-tk>	tom^: there's one for android already.
<tom^>	yes but thats no fun
<yurikoles>	a ncurses remote for android?
<arch-tk>	no
<arch-tk>	for kodi
<yurikoles>	who needs this?
<dacoit>	fuck no
<yurikoles>	yes
<yurikoles>	for kodi
<arch-tk>	yurikoles: kodi is a mediacentre thing
<yurikoles>	but controling from android or what?
<dacoit>	arch-tk: yurikoles is a troll
<tom^>	obviously
<yurikoles>	i know kodi
<arch-tk>	yurikoles: from anything which can run python
<yurikoles>	ok
<yurikoles>	with gui?
<tom^>	yurikoles: this is the third time you bring up something that you seemingly want to be discussed and is completly fucking stupid and meaningless.
<tom^>	yurikoles: shut the fuck up or get lost.
<elken>	please
<dacoit>	preferably both
<elken>	*shut the fuck up, please ;)
<arch-tk>	yurikoles: yes, obviously, because curses is a gui and widget library.
<yurikoles>	so who needs a ncurser remote for gui program?
<arch-tk>	yurikoles: https://a.pomf.se/ytbcdx.png - look, amazing gui
<yurikoles>	oh shi
<yurikoles>	it's weechat, in't it?
<yurikoles>	i have tried, but
<arch-tk>	it's gui chat
<arch-tk>	360 guis everywhere
<yurikoles>	"you can't write to this buffer"
<arch-tk>	yes, because you were too incompetent to understand what a command was
<elken>	arch-tk, i've just gotten here, what's yurikoles' problem?
<yurikoles>	it needs to recognize help at least, or not?
<arch-tk>	elken: he appears to be suffering from gui brain.
<arch-tk>	(pronounced gooey)
<elken>	he was whining about gay people earlier
<dacoit>	elken: obvious troll
<dacoit>	!troll
<phrik>	http://i.imgur.com/xblkv.jpg
<arch-tk>	elken: was he now, obviously i must be his worst nightmare then
<yurikoles>	thank you
<yurikoles>	but in #ubuntu i adviced one guy that wanted to become a hacker, to join #archlinux
<yurikoles>	and then
<tom^>	!ops
<phrik>	demize, escondida, falconindy, grawity, heftig, jelle, mrelendig/mion, tigrmesh/tigr, wonder/ioni, vodik – "release the kraken", yells tom^
<kevr>	yurikoles: take it to #archlinux-offtopic if you must
<dacoit>	take it and fuck off
<elken>	* take it to #fuck-off
<dacoit>	/dev/fuckoff
<yurikoles>	you are so gay
<kevr>	yurikoles: #archlinux is meant for people to converse about technical arch linux topics, and for general community help.
<dacoit>	brilliant
<elken>	/tmp/fuckoff so when i turn my computer off, you're gone
<kevr>	lol
<arch-tk>	wait
<arch-tk>	i need to ask him if he meant i was so gay.
<elken>	too late
<dacoit>	i think he would recant if he accidentally said something accurate
<elken>	now we'll never know
<arch-tk>	i messaged him.
<elken>	the saga continues
<arch-tk>	http://sprunge.us/nbdv
<elken>	i can't even
<elken>	wat
<elken>	is he drunk?
<arch-tk>	probably
<kevr>	that
<voidead>	it happens.. i have seen worse
<elken>	so what's the verdict
<elken>	are we safe from the scary gays?
<kevr>	never
<kevr>	they're always watching
<elken>	but i want to be free :(
<elken>	stop haunting me you gay
<arch-tk>	no, it's my job
<elken>	i thought it was your job to take the jobs of non-gays who worked hard
<arch-tk>	hahaha
<voidead>	easy now
<elken>	but the gays are coming :(
<coolthingy500>	what is yout problems with gays. well aside from them having access to hot women pussies.
<elken>	nothing, it's called "sarcasm"
<black_prince>	i  couldn't have picked the worst time to check in :|
<coolthingy500>	i;m jk
<elken>	hi jk
<elken>	i'm elken
<coolthingy500>	hello, my name is dick
<coolthingy500>	dick roman
<elken>	you just said you were jk
<elken>	i don't like liars
<coolthingy500>	couldn't help my self
<elken>	maybe that's a lie too
<coolthingy500>	gasp.
<coolthingy500>	how did you know?!
<coolthingy500>	are you a mind reader?
<elken>	i knew you'd ask that
<coolthingy500>	damn it.
<elken>	you can't fool a mind reader
<coolthingy500>	what are you psycho mantis?
<elken>	maybe
<coolthingy500>	well i got para-medic on the call. if she would stop talking about getting me to watch movies for 5 mins
<elken>	i didn't actually play mgs
<coolthingy500>	you're missing out. it's a good game series
<elken>	i will at some point
<coolthingy500>	puts a lot of games to shame
<elken>	i hear lots of good things about the story
<kevr>	i played the very first one back in the day
<kevr>	i think it was on the ps1 iirc?
<elken>	mgs yeah
<kevr>	yeah.
<coolthingy500>	it was. i played peace walker, and 3
<elken>	mg was on something else
<kevr>	ic
<elken>	i want to same game gear?
<elken>	idk
<elken>	before my time
<coolthingy500>	you could watch youtube videos about the game. i will warn you. mgs games tend to have more cutsences then gameplay
<elken>	i mean i *could*
<coolthingy500>	bascially you can watch a movie
<elken>	personally i prefer playing the game rather than wathcing a let's play
<coolthingy500>	same.
<elken>	ff7 has 2 hours of cutscenes, i can take it
<coolthingy500>	i just watch a let's play for one or two episodes. then get the game
<coolthingy500>	ftl faster then light is one of them
<elken>	i can't, and i don't really get how people can
<elken>	it's an experience you're meant to do, watching someone else just detracts imo
<elken>	single-player games that is
<coolthingy500>	they didn't have a brother to share a controller. or in my case when i was 15, a 30 year old girlfriend to that's a 7 out of 10 playing mario. i'm not make that up
<coolthingy500>	my dads
<elken>	i never had anyone to share a controller :p
<bougyman>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ewjmn8d820
<coolthingy500>	though she was a slut
<coolthingy500>	if there were 13 years old and they had to share a controller. believe me, when they turn 20 or so, they won't want to watch let's plays
<elken>	i'm only just getting my brother haha
<elken>	we were discussing playing ps1 games on epsxe
<thelemonman>	shit hits the fan pretty fast in here heh
<coolthingy500>	you should see the other irc distro forums
<elken>	should is a strong word
<sheep>	you mean channels
<coolthingy500>	yup. though on freenode. this is the largest there is.
<arch-tk>	archlinux topoffic
<james0r>	trying to connect to my bose soundlink mobile speakers 2 using bluetooth. i'm able to pair using bluetoothctl, but trying to connect just gives me failed to connect: org.bluez.error.failed
<jushur>	james0r: did you install the now split out package for pulseaudio bluetooth? (asuming you use pulseaudio)
<james0r>	jushur: hrmm not sure which one that is
<sheep>	pulseaudio-bluetooth
<arch-tk>	alright, my curses python kodi remote no longer does silly things: https://github.com/elitetk/nkodimote/blob/master/nkodimote.py
<phrik>	title: nkodimote/nkodimote.py at master · elitetk/nkodimote · github (at github.com)
<wasamasa>	 such alignment
<arch-tk>	wasamasa: such potato
<james0r>	jushur: yes that was what i was missing. thanks.
<elken>	niceme.me
<arch-tk>	wasamasa: i have to at work, so it ends up transferring to here.
<arch-tk>	wasamasa: blame my boss who aligns everything and demands everything to be aligned.
<arch-tk>	wasamasa: it's better than the code from yesterday
<arch-tk>	feel free to look at it and laugh
<wasamasa>	arch-tk: i had this weird feeling that it would be prettier in c
<[steven_m]>	will arch ever offer a systemd-less version?
<bellbreaker>	when pulseaudio is running, firefox freezes up all the time and ncmpcpp is unresponsive, saying "ncmpcpp timeout"
<wasamasa>	[steven_m]: that's your job
<arch-tk>	wasamasa: everything is prettier in c
<wasamasa>	arch-tk: nah
<arch-tk>	wasamasa: i'm not sure if you're joking or what.
<coolthingy500>	so is javascript
<bellbreaker>	it only happens when i try to actually play audio
<elken>	arch-tk, guessing you've taken part in ioccc?
<wasamasa>	arch-tk: plenty of c programs that are so ugly, any rewrite in a different language would be a substantial improvement
<arch-tk>	elken: the fuck is ioccc
<elken>	obfuscated c contest
<elken>	fuck the other letters
<arch-tk>	ah, no
<[steven_m]>	wasamasa: very funny :)
<wasamasa>	[steven_m]: it's arch, damnit
<elken>	you should check out some of the past solutions
<wasamasa>	[steven_m]: you make it what you want it to be
<elken>	some amazing stuff
<arch-tk>	wasamasa: you imagined jsonrpc + http would be prettier in c?
<arch-tk>	wasamasa: well, libcurl would make it rather nice
<wasamasa>	arch-tk: if there are libraries for it...
<arch-tk>	wasamasa: i don't think anyone has bothered with a library for jsonrpc
<elken>	arch-tk, http://www.big-llc.com/json/json-developer-guide.pdf :)
<arch-tk>	i honestly don't know how json + c would work either.
<arch-tk>	oh wow, there is a thing for it.
<arch-tk>	cool
<elken>	it's c
<elken>	there's a thing for everything :p
<arch-tk>	elken: i tried to look for a base64 lib for c
<arch-tk>	i couldn't find one
<arch-tk>	had to write my own.
<elken>	really
<elken>	something like that has to exist
<arch-tk>	probably for the better, being that there are about 20 variants of base64 and a library implementing all variants would be thrice as large as the thing i was writing.
<wasamasa>	is it about ignoring or not ignoring whitespace?
<arch-tk>	no clue
<arch-tk>	my thing doesn't give a fuck
<arch-tk>	it's designed for a specific purpose, takes about 70 lines and is in one file
<demize>	elken: it's so tiny that it's not much of a library.
<elken>	demize, what is, sorry?
<demize>	base64
<elken>	ah
<elken>	no i suppose not
<demize>	coreutils has one of its own, and of course eg glib and openssl has their own, but as a separate lib..
<elken>	stranger things have happened at c
<arch-tk>	wasamasa: anything else you have problems with?
<wasamasa>	arch-tk: no
<elken>	i'm no python guru but it looks good for what it does
<arch-tk>	i think i used as much of what was already there as i could.
<arch-tk>	i found a jsonrpc lib but it had zero documentation
<arch-tk>	and i don't think it actually was designed to be used like i wanted to use it.
<[steven_m]>	is xorg part of binary core or the source extra?
<arch-tk>	it's better than yesterday's version which implemented http 1.1 and used sockets.
<arch-tk>	sorry, implemented http 1.1, json, and used sockets
<elken>	we don't speak of that time anymore
<arch-tk>	can't forget that time when it also implemented c in python as an interpreted language
<elken>	wat
<arch-tk>	then i took cpython and ran it from within
<arch-tk>	so i could write my implementation of json within c but my implementation of http 1.1 in python
<elken>	why
<arch-tk>	at some point it ran the whole linux kernel.
<arch-tk>	in c, in python
<elken>	in jython
<arch-tk>	elken: were you asking why it implemented json and http 1.1 ?
<elken>	no, why you were using c in python :p
<jelle>	python has a json lib?!
<elken>	yes...?
<elken>	am i on punk'd?
<arch-tk>	jelle: yes....
<arch-tk>	jelle: everything has a json lib
<jelle>	sure
<jelle>	nevermind
<arch-tk>	apart from shitty proprietary languages which don't.
<elken>	and python has an everything lib
<jelle>	elken: lies
<elken>	jelle, if it exists, there's probably a python implementation of it :p
<jelle>	i often still miss a lot :p
<elken>	if not, there's definately a js framework for it
<kevr>	elken: c libraries serve as extensions in cpython
<kevr>	often, if you have like massive expensive loops, people implement them in a c extension so it runs natively
<jelle>	wat
<arch-tk>	probably a good idea for graphics stuff
<kevr>	making like a shared library in c for a python module
<elken>	yeah i get that
<elken>	but for json? :p
<arch-tk>	don't want to loop over every pixel 60 times a second
<kevr>	idk
<elken>	only 60?
<elken>	144 hz master race
<demize>	elken: parsing can quickly get slow.
<demize>	things like jansson will be a lot quicker
<arch-tk>	hmm, yeah...
<elken>	true
<jelle>	only if you measure though
<arch-tk>	demize: do you like my kodi remote thing!?!?!?
<demize>	hm?

<phrik>	title: nkodimote/nkodimote.py at master · elitetk/nkodimote · github (at github.com)
<thelemonman>	needs more abstractions, add some factories here and there
<arch-tk>	construct additional java?
<youngwolf>	is there a way to customise key bindings in pentadactyl ?
<thelemonman>	and write a stringbuilder class
<arch-tk>	youngwolf: i think so.
<elken>	youngwolf, same way you would in vim
<elken>	<mode>map <key> <command>
<youngwolf>	elken: thanks!
<elken>	save in .pentadactylrc
<arch-tk>	nnoremap h l
<elken>	$home/.pentadactylrc ofc
<arch-tk>	because xdg is too mainstream
<elken>	yeah use noremap if you're binding to something already bound
<demize>	arch-tk: mmmm.....
<arch-tk>	this is what it used to be like: https://github.com/elitetk/nkodimote/commit/cb2681f83cfe08b644b592ebfa2dd342156ccc9d

<finisboy>	q
<syedomar>	can i mount my new internal hardisk to /home/abc/here ?
<elken>	you can mount it wherever you want
<sheep>	syedomar: there's no reason why that wouldn't be possible
<elken>	as long as it's not already mounted and the dir isn't an existing mountpoint
<sheep>	the convention is to put it under /media though
<jelle>	lol conventions
<sheep>	elken: and the directory should be entry
<elken>	actually most distros use /run/media/$user
<demize>	arch-tk: heh
<sheep>	elken: that's automount though
<sheep>	well, temporary automatic mounting
<arch-tk>	demize: do you like the implementation of json and http 1.1 ?
<syedomar>	ouu thanks
<demize>	elken: that's used by udisks2.
<demize>	arch-tk: uhuh...
<elken>	ah
<smirky>	how can i build archlinux-arm pkgbuilds with x86_64
<jelle>	qemu or cross compiling
<smirky>	the second one
<smirky>	any examples?
<jelle>	nope
<elken>	if you're on the same network as the device you can use distcc
<smirky>	you mean mount the partition
<smirky>	and compile from the main device
<demize>	they didn't ask about distributed compilation.
<smirky>	but on external hard?
<elken>	no but distcc is the arch-arm official way to xcompile
<demize>	http://archlinuxarm.org/developers/distcc-cross-compiling mmmm
<phrik>	title: distcc cross-compiling | arch linux arm (at archlinuxarm.org)

<hexhaxtron>	i think i have 2 sound card available. how can i change the order of cards in alsa?
<mrelendig>	but the wiki does tell you how to change the order
<digitalkiwi>	have you tried using a mac where silly design choices like 2 sound cards aren't an issue?
<jelle>	ohshit
<elken>	shots fired
<hexhaxtron>	i got sound problems, i don't really know what's wrong... i can play a song for 4 or 5 seconds somewhat distorted and then it crashes.

<elken>	mrelendig, /msg <name> <text>
<mrelendig>	elken: it was for hexhaxtron

<digitalkiwi>	mrelendig i found the problem you have a space before your /

<d_garbage>	elken, thank you for trying to help the newbies }:]

<mrelendig>	not "/"
<d_garbage>	digitalkiwi, where've you been? long time
<digitalkiwi>	not here
<d_garbage>	good idea :p
<digitalkiwi>	i saw you talk about me a few weeks ago tho lol
<digitalkiwi>	i go idle for weeks-months at a time lately
<d_garbage>	i bet it was only nice things!
<digitalkiwi>	only really talk to a few people and in one or two channels
<digitalkiwi>	actually it was lol
<digitalkiwi>	i work too much
<digitalkiwi>	and not in tech really
<digitalkiwi>	i have a startup going and a regular job and they take all of my time and energy
<d_garbage>	grats!
<digitalkiwi>	might have more time for stuff soon tho
<digitalkiwi>	or at least more time for the startup
<digitalkiwi>	i quit my regular job...they're trying to get me to stay and work less days which is what i'd rather do than quit
<thelemonman>	less days same pay? that's an awesome deal!
<l4m8d4>	hello there
<skelayo>	yo
<elken>	o/
<l4m8d4>	i just wanted to install arch (my first install) on a very old box with i686 architecture, 128mb of ram and 800mhz processor
<digitalkiwi>	thelemonman no
<digitalkiwi>	it's hourly
<digitalkiwi>	so i guess same hourly? heh
<l4m8d4>	and i encountered a problem at the beginning of the process: after starting the setup, i get a few error messages
<elken>	!errors
<phrik>	don't just say it doesn't work. give the exact error. if you think that more information than a line or two will be useful, see !pastebin
<thelemonman>	l4m8d4, the i686 support was dropped some time ago
<l4m8d4>	it can't mount the installer disc and
<elken>	oh i686
<elken>	yeah it's done
<l4m8d4>	what is done, elken?
<l4m8d4>	oh no
<elken>	i686 support
<mrelendig>	elken: what about it?
<l4m8d4>	*tears dropping*
<elken>	-_-
<digitalkiwi>	i'd probably go from ~3000 a month to ~2250 but significantly less stress and i could work on my projects that aren't dead end jobs
<l4m8d4>	why is it still on the installer disc then?
<elken>	x86 != i686
<mrelendig>	i686 is, sadly, not dripped
<mrelendig>	elken: actually i686 is x86
<sheep>	well, a superset of x86
<tom^>	digitalkiwi: i tried explaining to my boss why i was searching for new opportunities elsewhere that money isnt everything.
<elken>	^
<tom^>	digitalkiwi: he didnt understand :p
<demize>	sheep: you mean a superset of 8086
<archtheoretical>	hi
<elken>	o/
<sheep>	yeah
<digitalkiwi>	i have significantly less than that in bills a month and the stress and lack of social life isn't worth it heh
<jelle>	tom^: money is everywhere!
<archtheoretical>	i just finished installing arch on virtualbox and am wondering what makes it so special?
<jelle>	nothing!
<elken>	you do archtheoretical
<tom^>	archtheoretical: nothing?
<tom^>	archtheoretical: linux here is still just linux.
<digitalkiwi>	i used to have to get by on 1600 a month and i have less expenses than i did then so  yeah...
<l4m8d4>	uh, does that mean i can forget about installing arch to that old box now?
<sheep>	l4m8d4: how old is it?
<archtheoretical>	i mean i currently run debian with i3 and stuff and thought what is the difference
<tom^>	archtheoretical: debian uses linux, arch uses linux.
<sheep>	l4m8d4: are you sure it's i686 and not i586?
<elken>	the names
<tom^>	archtheoretical: nothing.
<l4m8d4>	sheep: 1996 :d
<archtheoretical>	use debian stable to make it a server haha
<sheep>	l4m8d4: model?
<digitalkiwi>	arch has pacman
<digitalkiwi>	that's about it
<mrelendig>	digitalkiwi: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2mducoxw6i
<archtheoretical>	which in your opinion is the best fm
<digitalkiwi>	i mean that's a pretty cool thing i think but other than that and the community and the repo and fast updating
<digitalkiwi>	umm
<l4m8d4>	if you wait a moment, i will consult the installer disc to give you correct information
<sheep>	archtheoretical: arch follows a rolling release model (like debian unstable), has a different package manager, packages things differently (e.g. no split between foo and foo-dev), and has a stuff like the abs and aur
<digitalkiwi>	ok i guess it has more than just pacman
<digitalkiwi>	but that's a start
<mrelendig>	arch has allan
<mrelendig>	that makes it special
<archtheoretical>	well i learned how to partion using parted so there's that
<elken>	allan is one of a kind
<archtheoretical>	how about stallman?
<elken>	no
<digitalkiwi>	mrelendig that makes it break more
<digitalkiwi>	arch is for special people
<jelle>	allan is the best
<elken>	not stallman level of special
<tom^>	allan just breaks lawnmowers
<mrelendig>	also tacos and elephants
<digitalkiwi>	kiwi is way more special than stallman
<archtheoretical>	essentially the distros are like frats?
<elken>	press f to pay respects
<digitalkiwi>	wtf is repo elephant
<archtheoretical>	f
<digitalkiwi>	is that the elephant that toofishes did
<archtheoretical>	a repo is where you get the packages
<digitalkiwi>	is he still around
<archtheoretical>	where they are stored right?
<tom^>	archtheoretical: the only difference is how the software is packaged and which version comes with it and how you deal with software updates(your packagemanager).
<jelle>	digitalkiwi: yes that elephant
<archtheoretical>	l3m8d4 come back
<digitalkiwi>	what happened to it
<tom^>	archtheoretical: its still just linux everywhere tho, so you could do everything on ubuntu manually that you can do here.
<demize>	jelle: why do you miss something that isn't gone?
<jelle>	demize: i miss the phrik img
<jelle>	!repo-elephant
<digitalkiwi>	i miss clyde
<archtheoretical>	what are your top distros?
<tom^>	archtheoretical: but i guess it makes it a tad bit easier if the repos themself rather keep up to date then you having to do it yourself all the time
<digitalkiwi>	os x
<demize>	!tinier
<phrik>	http://arch.har-ikkje.net/gfx/elephant.jpg
<demize>	:3
<l4m8d4>	sheep: the installer disc pretty much tells me that it's a 32bit-only intel pentium iii processor with a clock speed of 800mhz
<archtheoretical>	bye guys ttyl
<digitalkiwi>	i took melatonin like an hour ago why am i not tired
<sheep>	l4m8d4: that should be i686-compatible
<l4m8d4>	since the installer didn't give me warnings, i assumed it's i686, but i guess i can't be sure then
<mrelendig>	time to put it down, it has suffered long enough
<kevr>	because your rage wins the day
<sheep>	i686 was the pentium pro
<mrelendig>	any intel >= pentium pro is i686
<voidead>	i686 is still around? hmm
<mrelendig>	except itanium
<mrelendig>	or how the fuck you spell it
<demize>	voidead: there's some i586 embedded things too
<jelle>	demize: omg it's there
<sheep>	also pii, piii, and celeron.  piv was netburst, which was backwards compativle with i686
<l4m8d4>	so, will i be able to install the arches on that old bone? :d
<sheep>	probably
<digitalkiwi>	is spotify premium nice
<kevr>	i liked it before they required premium to sync to mobile devices and stuff
<digitalkiwi>	i don't really use spotify much i think because i have the free one and it annoys me
<kevr>	probably the same with premium
<demize>	l4m8d4: pentium iii is p6 so i686, so should in theory work.
<demize>	!give l4m8d4 errormsg
<phrik>	l4m8d4: post the _exact_, _verbatim_ error message. paraphrasing, reciting from memory, or otherwise being vague will earn you a swift boot to the head.
<l4m8d4>	i am on it, guys, please hang on a minute... don't wanna risk a swift boot
<digitalkiwi>	can the live disc even boot on a computer if it can't be installed on it or how's that work
<elken>	wiccan sorcery
<elken>	same way all computers work
<kevr>	i thought they were ghosts
<elken>	we may never really know how computer work kevr
<digitalkiwi>	that was a serious question :(
<kevr>	everytime mine wants to fight me, i just kick it in it's face
<kevr>	then it works
<l4m8d4>	ok, sorry for the delay, i actually had to upload a freakin' picture to imgur: http://imgur.com/s12euoe
<phrik>	title: imgur (at imgur.com)
<l4m8d4>	this shows exactly the error i am getting
<tom^>	l4m8d4: did you use unetbootin ? if you did i will slap you.
<l4m8d4>	it is right after choosing the first menu point from the installer-cd
<elken>	what
<elken>	unetbootin
<elken>	where
<elken>	!flip
<phrik>	(╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻
<l4m8d4>	no, what i did to create the installer cd: i downloaded the latest iso file and burned it to a blank cd using brasero
<kevr>	looks like its trying to use a disk that has a label arch_201505
<elken>	prob what brasero labelled the disk
<kevr>	that it cant find
<tom^>	l4m8d4: ok, well for some reason the label on the cd then changed.
<tom^>	l4m8d4: hence the bootloader cant find the "arch_201505" disk
<l4m8d4>	should i reburn and/or redownload with custom setting? i have plenty of blank cds here
<tom^>	l4m8d4: figure out what its changed to, press e at the "menu" and manually edit it before bootin.
<l4m8d4>	another thing to note is that the resulting shell is completely unusable, i mean i can't even enter commands
<thelemonman>	the initramfs unpack errors out, i guess that's why it dies on you
<l4m8d4>	i just verified that the disk label is still correct, it says "arch_201505"
<l4m8d4>	so it should match with what the program tries to do i think
<mrelendig>	l4m8d4: are you using a usb stick?
<mrelendig>	if not, you should
<l4m8d4>	haha no, i am using an installer cd - i don't think this thing can boot from usb...
<l4m8d4>	it's from 1996 guys
<l4m8d4>	i could modify grub on it's hard drive though i guess
<l4m8d4>	but shouldn't there be a solution without using usb? because i think that would be quite a hassle, and the cd menu shows up
<l4m8d4>	so in principle it boots it
<kevr>	does this channel support help with tethering networks from android?
<sheep>	kevr: this channel can help with the linux side of things, but you may also want to check out #android
<digitalkiwi>	this channel promotes os x more than anything
<kevr>	sheep: for sure. thank you.
<digitalkiwi>	for that matter this channel supports every distro but arch more than arch
<elken>	arch sucks, nobody uses that thing
<digitalkiwi>	i'd grab that
<digitalkiwi>	but i'm pretty sure there are like 50 just like it

<l4m8d4>	i will try downloading the image again, verifying it's integrity and then burning it to disc
<l4m8d4>	are there any special things i have to tell brasero (other images always worked fine with it)
<arch-tk>	wasamasa: https://github.com/elitetk/nkodimote - i did some stuff. can you think of any better way of doing the actions_eval ?
<phrik>	title: elitetk/nkodimote · github (at github.com)
<wasamasa>	eval?
<wasamasa>	d:
<namarrgon>	l4m8d4: you verified the checksum of the disc after you burned it?
<wasamasa>	you know that python has first-class functions, don't you
<wasamasa>	you can just pass em around
<mrelendig>	there are valid uses of eval but they are rare
<tom^>	btw lua sucks
<tom^>	digitalkiwi: ^
<mrelendig>	also needs more setup.py
<wasamasa>	foo = print; foo('bar')
<digitalkiwi>	lol
<wasamasa>	the illusion breaks upon usage of this on + and such
<mrelendig>	and actual config file
<l4m8d4>	namarrgon: yes i did verify the integrity of the burned image via brasero
<wasamasa>	but there's an operators module somewhere
<l4m8d4>	however, i didn't check if the downloaded image was the same as on the server
<l4m8d4>	i will this time
<namarrgon>	l4m8d4: use a slower speed for burning, just in case
<mrelendig>	more likely to be crappy hardware
<l4m8d4>	the computer works, it can boot a debian system... i don't have anything better than this "crappy hardware" right now to work with
<mrelendig>	worst case you can always install arch from debian
<digitalkiwi>	best case is install os x
<keenerd>	ew.
<kevr>	digitalkiwi: why are you so fixated on os x today?
<elken>	because it's the superior os ofc
<d_garbage>	!grab digitalkiwi

<tazmain>	ewe i see although netrunner rolling is based on arch, it uses the manjaro package manager. ewe ewe ewe
<tom^>	wat
<tom^>	manjaro uses pacman
<digitalkiwi>	hahahaha
<digitalkiwi>	well obviously pacman is shit!
<elken>	it matches the rest of arch
<digitalkiwi>	clyde is dead. long live clyde
<wasamasa>	digitalkiwi: my registrar tells me i don't need a local contact for it
<tazmain>	no they have a gui frontend
<elken>	for pacman
<tazmain>	this makes no sense "while the rolling release is based on arch package management (manjaro)"
<elken>	pacmac is still pacman
<d_garbage>	ugh, i try not to think about it, the whole thing annoys me far more than it should
<elken>	i think it uses pacman(?)
<elken>	never used anything but vanilla
<digitalkiwi>	wtf i am still not tired i took that super snooze 2 hours ago usually i can sleep by now :(

<l4m8d4>	thelemonman pointed out that the initramfs unpacking failed
<l4m8d4>	what could be the cause of this and how could i prevent/work around it?
<phaazon>	hey, which e-mail client would you recommend?
<elken>	i use evolution because gnome, but on everything else i use thunderbird
<emperiz>	phaazon: if you want to be 1337, use mutt. otherwise, thunderbird.
<phaazon>	isn’t thunderbird dead?
<elken>	no..?
<phaazon>	i’ve been told its development is about to fade away
<l4m8d4>	as far as i know the featureset is complete but bugs are still getting fixed
<d_garbage>	l4m8d4, try a different image maybe, knoppix or opensuse
<l4m8d4>	you mean i should install another distribution and install arch from there?
<d_garbage>	just see if anything works at all
<d_garbage>	xp maybe :p
<elken>	yup
<elken>	it's what i did on my laptop
<d_garbage>	or win98

<lied>	does anybody has a tip for me which laptop to buy? it should have a big resoultion, long battery time and of course support linux
<wasamasa>	lied: ditch the large resolution and buy an used thinkpad, d'uh
<emperiz>	lied: for the last requirement, something from lenovo isn't that bad.
<lied>	wasamasa: nah, i already own a thinkpad (w520). it's to heavy and battery is not soo good
<j_____>	ok, so i had a quick question about kernel modules; i got some module (wacom and wacom_w8001) in /lib/modules/4.0.2-1-arch/extra and some 'default' ones that exist in /lib/modules/4.0.2-1-arch/kernel. how do i blacklist / swap / use the ones in extra?
<wasamasa>	lied: why the hell the w-line then
<wasamasa>	lied: they're not portable at all
<wasamasa>	!give lied g thinkpad guide
<pizzashaveheart>	lied: aspire v5 i3 core with atheros wifi super light
<phrik>	lied: used thinkpad buyers guide - ktgee.net: <http://ktgee.net/post/49423737148/thinkpad-guide>
<elken>	i hear thinkpad x's are good
<elken>	x2{4,5}0
<wasamasa>	"sent from a x200s"
<lied>	elken: thanks
<elken>	i have a dell inspiron (i forget the code) and i love it
<j_____>	in /etc/modules-load.d/wacom.conf the names become just 'wacom' and 'wacom_w8001' for both modules (extra and kernel)
<l4m8d4>	uh so i kinda fell asleep... so if i understand correctly i should try to install arch from within linux, not from the cd... i am going to try that later, thank you guys for your help so far!
<tom^>	hah
<boreeas>	i have a problem with font spacing on my terminal: http://i.imgur.com/bekysxu.png on the left, you can see how it's supposed to look, but any new terminals i open look like on the right or the bottom
<boreeas>	i didn't modify .xresources at all, the only changes i did was installing firefox-nightly and ttf-ms-fonts from aur
<boreeas>	any idea what could've happened?
<heftig>	boreeas: is ttf-dejavu installed?
<heftig>	also, don't use firefox-nightly from aur
<heftig>	installing mozilla builds using packages breaks the autoupdater
<boreeas>	oh that's good to know
<boreeas>	ttf-dejavu isn't installed, no
<heftig>	boreeas: install it
<badministrator>	boreeas: try xrdb --merge ~/.xresources and then spawn some more terminals
<heftig>	you're lacking a sane base font set, which is why installing other fonts caused weird fallbacks
<boreeas>	badministrator: tried that, didn't help
<badministrator>	hmm spooky
<boreeas>	hmm, looks better now, but there's still a lot of extra spacing
<boreeas>	http://imgur.com/ay5anwn
<phrik>	title: imgur (at imgur.com)
<heftig>	boreeas: which terminal is that?
<boreeas>	urxvt
<badministrator>	specify a monospace font in you xresources?
<boreeas>	yeah
<boreeas>	adobe's source code pro regular
<dixoncx>	hi, new to kde.. is it possible to add system tray icon for clementine ?
<heftig>	boreeas: i'd recommend using another terminal
<heftig>	boreeas: xterm, urxvt et al suck if you use vector fonts
<tigrmesh>	dixoncx, did you check the arch wiki?
<boreeas>	heftig: which one would you recommend?
<tigrmesh>	probably one that isn't so hard to set up
<tigrmesh>	;)
<heftig>	boreeas: try termite
<dixoncx>	tigrmesh, there is no page for clementine in arch wiki. i am going throgh arch's kde wiki page now
<tigrmesh>	the kde page
<tigrmesh>	since this is about computers in general, i'll paste this here  http://www.boredpanda.com/73-year-old-excel-paintings-tatsuo-horiuchi/
<elken>	dixoncx, what do you mean? clementine has a tray icon?
<elken>	is it enabled in settings
<elken>	tools->prefs->general->behaviour
<dixoncx>	yes in prefs there is a checkbox..
<elken>	then something's goofed
<dixoncx>	ok, is there any widget for contolling music playback in kde ?
<dixoncx>	i was able to find one in gnome,
<dixoncx>	not in kde
<elken>	probably, yes
<elken>	aur, google, kde-look
<dixoncx>	ok.
<teraflop>	dixoncx: sounds kde related, i can see the clementine tray icon if i launch trayer in xmonad
<boreeas>	heftig: looks great, thanks
<elken>	i've not had issues with it when i used kde though
<dixoncx>	teraflop, sorry, xmonad ?
<dixoncx>	oh another de
<elken>	wm
<teraflop>	dixoncx: wm, the point is that it is shown in trayer
<dixoncx>	oh..
<earnestly>	bougyman: pony fixed the issue of setting nonblock on stdin appropriately and quickly.  (this is a good sign given how much hassle it took to get it fixed in rust...)
<dixoncx>	i was playing around with different desktop environments.. as i bored with new gnome.. tried xfce, lxde, and now trying kde5. none feels home :(
<tigrmesh>	that's too bad
<dixoncx>	looks like am going back to lxed, which seems better for my likes.. how would be lxqt ? i plans to try that next..
<dixoncx>	*lxde
<tigrmesh>	i've started using lxqt.  i enjoy watching projects in active development, and this one is very active
<dixoncx>	oh.. :)
<tigrmesh>	possibility of danger.  keep at least one alternative
<thrice>	it's not stable so far?
<dixoncx>	oh ?
<tigrmesh>	thrice, there are releases.  but the new features are still in git  :)
<tigrmesh>	active development is very active, thrice  :)
<utack_>	is someone else here using cinnamon as de? i have a memory leak in it, and wondered if that is just in my setup
<tigrmesh>	*newest features
<thrice>	ah
<tigrmesh>	utack_, what are the symptoms, and what have you tried already to find it?
<utack_>	tigrmesh slowly increases memory usage. usually 1gb after some hours, worst i have seen was 8gb after 12h
<utack_>	and i don't know how to find such thing, what would you try
<tigrmesh>	oy
<tigrmesh>	how do you know it's cinnamon and not something else, like firefox?
<cookiejar>	utack_, i have not noticed memory leaks on my cinnamon environment
<utack_>	ok
<utack_>	tigrmesh gnome system monitor (but htop reports the same plus minus some rounding or maybe gb vs gib)
<utack_>	i could probablly monitor the usage on my netbook, same software almost
<cookiejar>	only issue i've had is, by the looks of it, gtk fucking up when i use audacious
<sysios>	can i decrease my cpu temperature in arch? on windows i had ~45 celcius dgrs, but arch has ~53
<utack_>	cookiejar how much memory does the task with name "cinnamon" use for you?
<cookiejar>	lemme check
<sysios>	i did enable i915 and acpi stuff
<tom^>	sysios: lol
<tom^>	sysios: stop using your cpu then.
<tigrmesh>	utack_, have you looked at their bug tracker?  https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon/issues
<phrik>	title: issues · linuxmint/cinnamon · github (at github.com)
<cookiejar>	utack_, using about 234mb
<utack_>	allright. uses the same on my netbook i just started
<cookiejar>	this system has been running for about 9 days
<utack_>	on my desktop it is already at 550mb again after exactly 1h uptime
<sysios>	tom^: i did not consider this
<thrice>	no additional extensions or anything?
<utack_>	tigrmesh i should do that again, maybe someone reported it, it was not when i first noticed about two weeks ago
<cookiejar>	utack_, what version of cinnamon?
<cookiejar>	running 2.4.8-1 here
<utack_>	the same one
<utack_>	maybe one app i use triggers it, somehow by panel icon or try icon
<cookiejar>	possibly
<utack_>	i will just leave it running on my netbook for a while and see if it happens as well
<tigrmesh>	utack_, did you search their bugtracker for "memory"?  also, what bugtracker did you look at?
<utack_>	the one you linked at
<utack_>	only thing i found was about the file manager leaking memory, but that is a separate task
<cookiejar>	this talk reminds me to experiment with my issue with audacious
<cookiejar>	oh, there it goes
<utack_>	oh wait, i tried "leak" instead of memory nad this came up: https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon/issues/3796
<phrik>	title: memory leak in cinnamon 2.4? · issue #3796 · linuxmint/cinnamon · github (at github.com)
<tigrmesh>	yeah
<tigrmesh>	we don't all the same terms for things  :)
<cookiejar>	yeah
<cookiejar>	man, i should try searching for my issue with audacious / gtk but i have no idea how to word it in a searchable way
<tigrmesh>	i found the link to that in the antergos forum...
<cookiejar>	seems to only happen when i play stuff with tags ie flac and mp3, normally on track change, but doesn't always happen
<tigrmesh>	so i didn't do it perfectly myself
<tigrmesh>	those are so hard to debug
<cookiejar>	it then breaks a bunch of gtk elements, any other windows i have open, cinnamon panel
<cookiejar>	this issue doesn't pop up when playing something weird like midi or sid
<tigrmesh>	what about  audacious flac breaks gtk   ?
<tigrmesh>	in some form?  flac is easy because i's not a term used for other things
<tigrmesh>	flac breaks gtk in audacious   ?
<cookiejar>	seems to be any audio file that has tags, flac, mp3, ogg
<utack_>	the "looking glass" gave me this: http://abload.de/img/bildschirmfotovom2015j6y98.png
<tigrmesh>	cookiejar, play with ti

<cookiejar>	maybe i should just switch to the qt version :^)
<tigrmesh>	utack_, hmm
<cookiejar>	well, i found a christian rock band by the same name https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu8gk3b69f4
<utack_>	tigrmesh i am not a dev so i can't debug more, but i will try to find what triggers it by comparing my netbook with cinnamon to my desktop
<tigrmesh>	utack_, sounds good.  also try shutting down all other programs before you leave it to idle
<tigrmesh>	*and other services.  on both machines
<utack_>	i am currently going the other way round, enabling more and more on my netbook until it hopefulyl starts memleaking as well
<tigrmesh>	ahh
<tigrmesh>	make the programs and services running on both as similar as possible
<mrelendig>	utack_: this is how we fix computer in mother russia!
<utack_>	mrelendig i am not that far from mother russia, but i will wait until i give it the wodka baptism
<utack_>	tigrmesh trying, yes. but maybe i should disable as much as possible..
<utack_>	or try the cinnamon software rendering session
<cookiejar>	belarus?
<tigrmesh>	utack_, either way.  just make sure you keep both machines as similar as possible

<phrik>	title: windows calculator gives wrong answer - microsoft community (at answers.microsoft.com)
<arch-tk>	you can't even trust microsoft to write a working calculator.
<mrelendig>	clearly it is malware
<sudokode>	run this may be something is corrugated in the core files.
<mrelendig>	as per the first comment
<arch-tk>	:p
<elken>	they are all running malware
<sudokode>	yeah, look out for them corrugated files
<arch-tk>	it would be funny to see someone actually write malware which breaks the windows calculator.
<utack_>	what is the result?
<wasamasa>	well...
<elken>	sqrt(4) is 2...
<utack_>	something with 1e-19 is actualyl good enough...
<arch-tk>	utack_: 0 + epsilon
<earnestly>	1+2*3 = 9
<earnestly>	1+2*3 = 7
<sudokode>	lol
<arch-tk>	earnestly: i noticed that too
<elken>	2+2=5
<bshah>	that escalated quickly
<earnestly>	let 5 = 10 in 5 + 5 -- 20
<elken>	there's a proof for that somewhere
<arch-tk>	changing from standard mode to programmer's mode completely changes from shitty step by step calculation to proper infix.
<arch-tk>	bshah: no you're doing it wrong
<arch-tk>	x**2
<arch-tk>	well that escalated quickly
<arch-tk>	that's how you make maths jokes
<earnestly>	all of their sqrt uses are wrong
<earnestly>	how on earth
<sudokode>	elken: 1+2+3+4+5... = -1/12
<sudokode>	!shrug2
<phrik>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<arch-tk>	earnestly: i think they use a shitty float
<arch-tk>	apparently it's to do with them not using ieee floats
<elken>	isn't maths great
<elken>	something here doesn't add up though

<phrik>	title: stupid float tricks | random ascii (at randomascii.wordpress.com)
<sudokode>	ikr
<earnestly>	arch-tk: it is just floating point operations without any kind of epsilon
<lyonsb>	no, 2+5 = green
<earnestly>	lyonsb: you can express that in haskell
<arch-tk>	earnestly: i was giving the answer given without writing 0.000000000000000000000000000000001
<arch-tk>	earnestly: i feel 0 + epsilon is easier to write than 0.00000000000000000000000000000001238421242135
<lyonsb>	i was just actually thinking . . ."wait, i could just be describing a bitmap . . ."
<d_garbage>	i met this suspicious character the other day, he tried to tell me he was a mathematician but i dunno, something about his story just didn't add up
<earnestly>	lyonsb: it's all math in the end :p
<d_garbage>	!sting
<phrik>	ba-dum *ching*
<lyonsb>	earnestly, our screens express things like that all the time, like . . ."this pixel is .007v " etc . ..
<earnestly>	lyonsb: from the way fonts are drawn to how complex 3d environments are rendered
<earnestly>	heh, yeah
<elken>	d_garbage, did he come off quite negative?
<d_garbage>	elken, multiple times
<utack_>	i don't understand how people can say something with 1e-19 is a failure when the expected result is zero...
<d_garbage>	elken, though in some ways, that was a plus
<utack_>	that is not even a bugreport, that is just pc math
<sheep>	it should get closer to 0 with double precision floating point
<earnestly>	utack_: it's ieee 754 math*
<earnestly>	and that standard kind of sucks because it needs nan and other shit
<mrelendig>	[oh@yuki][~/build/aur/static/gist]% dc <<< "10k4v2-p"
<mrelendig>	0
<arch-tk>	utack_: because ieee floats do it right? :p
<utack_>	earnestly not sure about hte standards, but for a pc that is definitly a very good result for zero
<mrelendig>	dc ftw
<earnestly>	you can't implement ieee 754 in hardware without needing state tracking
<earnestly>	which is lame
<arch-tk>	earnestly: they're not using ieee floats
<earnestly>	utack_: it would have been fine if they didn't have those requirements
<earnestly>	utack_: uhm.  okay.
<utack_>	ok...
<earnestly>	mrelendig: ghci also returns 0.0
<thelemonman>	(- (sqrt 4.0) 2.0)
<thelemonman>	sigfpe \o/
<wasamasa>	._.
<thelemonman>	i think something is very wrong here
<wasamasa>	well, it works fine in `csi`
<arch-tk>	earnestly: ieee guarantees correct rounding for addition, multiplication, subtraction, division and square-root, the stuff the windows calculator does does not.
<wasamasa>	same story with `sbcl`
<sheep>	thelemonman: which interpreter was that
<sudokode>	wasamasa: but is it blue or white?
<thelemonman>	a fresh csi repl returned 0 as expected
<thelemonman>	sheep, csi
<wasamasa>	0.0
<sudokode>	or is it a white t-shirt?
<wasamasa>	thelemonman: `csi` is a bit weird at times
<sudokode>	dun dun dunnnnnn
<thelemonman>	wasamasa, still better than ocaml's utop
<thelemonman>	after a while it slows down to a crawl

<fsckd>	sounds legit
<sudokode>	so what's new in the linux world
<jelle>	anyway current season is so different from the book i'm sad
<mrelendig>	sudokode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edflm7hh3hs
<fsckd>	jon snow is a secret targaryen!
<sudokode>	lol. i like how the op is just like... yeah offtopic cause got
<arch-tk>	that's what some think.
<jelle>	lolrumors
<tigrmesh>	jelle, don't encourage them!
<sudokode>	:d
<jelle>	tigrmesh: who who!
<arch-tk>	there's lots and lots of weird rumours.
<arch-tk>	jelle: yeah, i kept hearing about it.
<saapa>	everyone wants them dragons!
<arch-tk>	spoiler alert: in the books, deanerys barely just got onto a dragon and the book ended.
<d_garbage>	heheh poor warf, that was funny
<jelle>	ohhhh
<saapa>	how rude
<jelle>	i wanna talk!
<saapa>	you can't just give op to everyone, chanserv
<saapa>	!
<tigrmesh>	you got a pass because you're new, saapa
<saapa>	i'm not that new!
<arch-tk>	i think saapa is asking for it though.
<arch-tk>	by "it" i mean cookies
<saapa>	how very dare you, sir?!
<earnestly>	that said, the books are a lot better.  read them instead
<tigrmesh>	seems like it
<d_garbage>	that compilation is ever better at 2x speed
<tigrmesh>	dude
<arch-tk>	tigrmesh: i think that was a successful topic change.
<jelle>	dang
<fsckd>	sometimes you need to manually change the topic :p
<arch-tk>	anyway
<sudokode>	d_garbage: are you compiling a book?
<earnestly>	teehee
<d_garbage>	sudokode, no, mrelendig's link
<saapa>	you can't just ban everyone talking about got! tsk tsk
<arch-tk>	in other news, i heard that they run archlinux on the computers on set of got.
<fsckd>	gnu over torrents
<saapa>	sudo systemctl status dragons.service
<sudokode>	go's over-tweeted
<sudokode>	+t
<saapa>	dragons are active
<gulzar>	do text based web browsers really save data?
<sudokode>	i should really update at some point
<sudokode>	gulzar: what?
<earnestly>	gulzar: sure
<mottbrown>	hey my machine stopped suspending properly, namely it wakes up after a few seconds, how do i diagnose why?
<gulzar>	sudokode: the data plan bandwidth
<thelemonman>	the dover books on mathematics series is really awesome and cheap
<sudokode>	oic.. yeah, no images or plugins
<sheep>	mottbrown: check dmesg
<fsckd>	mottbrown: i would start looking at the journal
<jelle>	sheep: javascript
<jelle>	err sudokode
<sudokode>	jelle: you still get the javascript though, don't you?
<sudokode>	so that doesn't save data
<jelle>	not sure
<sudokode>	even so, it's miniscule text
<sudokode>	compared to just one image
<jelle>	not sure how to view what's downloaded in w3m
<gulzar>	so which is recommended ? for research article search and download option (pdf)
<thelemonman>	apparently it's stuff from the ~'80
<wasamasa>	gulzar: an actual browser
<sudokode>	but even just blocking script loading would prevent pulling in data from up to a dozen other sites
<sudokode>	depending on where you go
<earnestly>	http://booksc.org/
<phrik>	title: electronic library. download articles free. finding articles (at booksc.org)
<sudokode>	hell, you could use firefox with noscript and block images
<gulzar>	i will be shifting to slow and limited data plan , so want to save some data
<sudokode>	you'd get about the same bandwidth use as a text browser
<wasamasa>	^
<prinsen>	if i add a bridge on my internal network interface, the normal traffic cant get trought. its on a box which acts as a router
<earnestly>	sudokode: except less
<jelle>	gulzar: where do you live?
<arch-tk>	i actually have a relevant question: what was that implementation of markdown which doesn't suck?
<earnestly>	no images
<earnestly>	no javascript
<sudokode>	earnestly: see block images ^&
<tom^>	are we discussing again who is the rightful heir to the iron throne?
<sudokode>	and js ^
<gulzar>	jelle: india
<earnestly>	css is still there
<gulzar>	tom^: hi, long time
<wasamasa>	gulzar: don't worry, you'll offset that by the extra browsing you need to do
<mottbrown>	sheep: dmesg doesnt really reveal anything
<sudokode>	tom^: clearly linus
<arch-tk>	there was some markdown under a separate name which was more expanded and more standardised.
<tom^>	gulzar: who are you?
<sudokode>	though stallman will probably try and red wedding linus
<sheep>	mottbrown: it might reveal a device failing to suspend
<gulzar>	tom^: not a bot
<gulzar>	so no particular recommendation, then i have to test them all
<thelemonman>	what the fuck, the book is $3 on amazon.com and 16€ on amazon.it
<mottbrown>	sheep: yeah nothing looks wrong i dunno
<sudokode>	tom^: that's eugene goostman
<jelle>	thelemonman: but the shipping sucks from .com
<sheep>	mottbrown: check the journal too
<sudokode>	he's definitely not a bot
<mrelendig>	thelemonman: and both will delete the book from your library too!
<gulzar>	earnestly: i have the source of books, that requirement is just one thing i have to do
<wasamasa>	thelemonman: so you're https://github.com/lemonboy
<phrik>	title: lemonboy (giuseppe) · github (at github.com)
<gulzar>	earnestly: thank you
<jelle>	gulzar: btw maybe you want a proxy
<gulzar>	jelle: why?
<jelle>	gulzar: do filter some content
<thelemonman>	jelle, still better than paying it 5x
<thelemonman>	mrelendig, they do what ?
<gulzar>	jelle: ok
<gulzar>	jelle: will remember this
<gulzar>	jelle: thank you
<thelemonman>	wasamasa, yep, i'm a handsome egg
<arch-tk>	oh come on, someone must know
<sudokode>	sanders 2016
<sudokode>	ahem
<mottbrown>	sheep: im thinking this is either hardware or too low level to really diagnose

<smove>	hey guys, i'm about to set up my arch box as one node/slave for distcc. i found that there are only x86_64-unkown-... binaries being installed with gcc. so, i'm wondering why there are not x86_64-pc-... binaries and how i should deal with it properly? is there an explaination for that in the wiki somewhere? (didn't find one so far). ofc i could just symlink the binary but first i want to know if archlinux has a reason for those unknown binaries etc

<ox33>	hi all. lately i have been having problems when resuming from standby (not hibernation). i have no lan connection at all. systemctl status dhcpcd@enp11s0 says dhcpcd is running, but when i try to restart it, it fails without a specific reason.

<cykacykacyka>	erm, so as reported by the person operating the computer 1000 miles away, when gdm is started, xorg doesn't even run, but the screen is black with a single white line flickering on the top of the screen with the latest fglrx drivers
<cykacykacyka>	dmesg gives me nothing, journalctl gives me naught, xorg logs don't even get created
<cykacykacyka>	and i've disabled wayland in gdm, so that shouldn't be an issue
<namarrgon>	gdm/gnome don't like fglrx
<namarrgon>	set up ~/.xinitrc to run gnome, 'startx' then post the xorg log
<cykacykacyka>	namarrgon, it segfaults, will send you a paste in a second
<namarrgon>	gnome-shell?
<cykacykacyka>	namarrgon, is there a nice utility that pastes files from cli to any service ?
<cykacykacyka>	namarrgon, no just a regular startx
<namarrgon>	!sprunge
<phrik>	pipe or redirect your command or file into `curl -f 'sprunge=<-' sprunge.us`. this will upload to sprunge.us and return a link to the paste.
<namarrgon>	yes but which process segfaults?
<cykacykacyka>	xorg
<cykacykacyka>	http://sprunge.us/ybhh
<cykacykacyka>	is it still necessary to downgrade x to use fglrx, namarrgon ?
<namarrgon>	not with catalyst-test
<namarrgon>	or whatever the name was
<namarrgon>	is that xorg.conf newly generated?
<cykacykacyka>	hmm, i don't thing the guy is using catalyst-test
<cykacykacyka>	yes
<cykacykacyka>	with aticonf --init
<namarrgon>	post the output of 'startx'
<namarrgon>	the system doesn't seem to be up to date
<cykacykacyka>	should i be worried that the installed drivers come from a 'catalyst' repo and are all designed for ubuntu ?
<namarrgon>	what driver?
<dagle>	cykacykacyka: "designed for ubuntu".
<dagle>	their development cycle syncs from time to time with ubuntu testing.
<cykacykacyka>	namarrgon, 15.200, should i just startx | curl -f 'sprunge=<-' sprunge.us ?
<cykacykacyka>	and yes, namarrgon, you were right, i'll update the system
<dagle>	and some times it lags behind the latest xorg version.
<cykacykacyka>	dagle, yes, that's what i'm worried about
<cykacykacyka>	anyway, since the guy's isp is really slow, i'll see you in a bit
<namarrgon>	cykacykacyka: |& istead of |
<sternmull>	any idea why dolphin can auto-mount usb-pens but pcmanfm can not? it doesnt even show the device after it was mounted by dolphin.
<cykacykacyka>	ok, namarrgon
<binarycodes>	any facing problem with xmonad recently? i just found that my conky dzen2 bar is not showing up and on xmonad --recompile its showing a bunch of errors. the config file is unchanged for about a year now ...
<cykacykacyka>	binarycodes, it's just hardcoded to safely fail, since that is the only default behaviour you can guarantee in haskell
<binarycodes>	err ... then xmonad --recompile would always fail!
<d_garbage>	sternmull, is it supposed to?
<earnestly>	binarycodes: just use ghc to rebuild it, debug as usual
<junka>	i just installed a mpv update, it breaks mpv
<earnestly>	binarycodes: it is not a config file either, it is a haskell program
<binarycodes>	earnestly, ghc to rebuild xmonad?
<sternmull>	earnestly: at least it has a "devices" category by default in its left pane.
<earnestly>	binarycodes: ghc 7.10 changed things a bit (notably making applicative a superclass of monad)
<namarrgon>	junka: only mpv was updated?
<earnestly>	junka: how does it "break"?
<junka>	namarrgon; no some other pkgs too, but once i downgraded it was functional again
<namarrgon>	what's the error?
<junka>	i get mpv: error while loading shared libraries: libxss.so.1: cannot open shared object file: no such file or directory
<sternmull>	earnestly: is there another way to get automount of removable disks without dolphin?
<earnestly>	junka: fuck off, seriously.
<earnestly>	sternmull: no idea
<sternmull>	ok :)
<namarrgon>	junka: pacman -q libxss
<earnestly>	sternmull: oh wait, you just want automount of removable media?
<junka>	namarrgon; not found
<sternmull>	earnestly: yes. i would even prefer a way that does not rely on a gui application.
<cykacykacyka>	namarrgon, erm, so the kernel comes up as 3.19, but i am pretty sure i compiled the driver for 4.0.1
<cykacykacyka>	namarrgon, here's the output http://sprunge.us/ihfp
<earnestly>	sternmull: udisks2 provides the mechanism for mounting media for your user, tools like udiskie provide the daemon which does automounting.  this is essentially the same position as dolphin
<namarrgon>	cykacykacyka: the log says 4.0.1 is running, the non-testing repos have 4.0.2
<earnestly>	sternmull: both use udisk2 for the mechanism but are presented and used in different ways
<bb010g>	anybody know why cargo isn't included with the rust package? in the normal distribution & rust-nightly-bin on aur, it is. is a separate package for cargo in community planned?
<earnestly>	bb010g: no one knows, but my opinion is that because cargo is too garbage to install
<sternmull>	earnestly: thanks. will read about them.
<wasamasa>	lol
<earnestly>	that's likely not the reason, the reason is probably just the maintainer hasn't included it yet
<wasamasa>	who is the current maintainer of the rust package btw?
<earnestly>	wasamasa: ponylang fixed the non-blocking stdin issue straight away without having to go through the almost sisyphean task of explaining why o_nonblock on shared fds is a bad idea
<junka>	namarrgon; the update was just 0.9.1-1 -> 0.9.1-2 i dont see why would i need libxss
<earnestly>	wasamasa: https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?maintainer=arodseth
<phrik>	title: arch linux - package search (at www.archlinux.org)
<earnestly>	wasamasa: unlike rust
<wasamasa>	oh, the maintainer of the erlang package
<earnestly>	who didn't understand that o_nonblock on fds like stdin was probably a stupid idea...
<namarrgon>	junka: run ldd on the mpv binary
<junka>	namarrgon; thanks
<namarrgon>	junka: is it linked against libxss?
<cykacykacyka>	namarrgon, damn, i'm too tired with this xorg thing to notice. anyway, any other logs i could read ? or anything i can do ?
<earnestly>	(of course it is)
<namarrgon>	cykacykacyka: -syu, rebuild the module if you have to, post the new startx log
<namarrgon>	*xorg log
<namarrgon>	don't forget to reboot after the kernel update
<cykacykacyka>	namarrgon, will do
<cykacykacyka>	namarrgon, will you still be here after an hour ?
<namarrgon>	cykacykacyka: maybe, just ping me
<namarrgon>	junka: so?
<holomorph>	herp derp
<braindamage>	phrik: justgoogleit is: just gಠ_ಠgle it already
<earnestly>	braindamage: nice
<myrrlyn>	so i was running enlightenment via startx, not via a display manager, and it crashed
<myrrlyn>	the computer now has /no/ display, not even the console from which i ran enlightenment initially
<myrrlyn>	is there a way to get back to that without rebooting?
<neffi>	myrrlyn: can you alt-fn to another console and killall xorg?
<neffi>	i guess it'd be `killall xinit`
<myrrlyn>	nope
<myrrlyn>	the monitor says the machine is putting out no display signal whatsoever, and is in standby mode
<myrrlyn>	(monitor in standby, not machine)
<neffi>	can you ssh in from another machine or your phone?
<myrrlyn>	yep!
<myrrlyn>	i'm even speaking to you like that
<neffi>	and everything is working? did you try killing xinit?
<hongouru>	i'm getting an error when running makepkg -si ... it says clone succeded but checkout failed. error: there were errors creating the working copy or something
<hongouru>	not too much info on the error
<earnestly>	better than your paraphrasing
<myrrlyn>	there aren't any xorg or xinit processes
<p1k>	how can i get dmesg or journal info after a reboot if a bug prevents systemd from recording the journal ?
<myrrlyn>	hongouru: that's a git error. something's fucky in the directory where you're attempting to dump the git repo
<hongouru>	sht!!!! no space available at home directory
<louisdk>	've booted from a linux mint live-cd 64-bit what i had laying around and i've chrooted into my new arch install, but /sys/firmware/efi isn't found. does the live cd needs to be uefi for me to be able to play around with uefi on arch in chroot?
<myrrlyn>	that would be fucky
<hongouru>	myrrlyn, yeah !!!
<hongouru>	fucky, totally
<hongouru>	hhahaaa
<neffi>	louisdk: yes, i believe so
<neffi>	the arch install cd will boot efi. use that.
<hongouru>	nice term...
<myrrlyn>	neffi: interestingly enough, the server will happily run and forward x applications over ssh
<neffi>	dropping a line: if anyone is using a samsung 840 evo with linux and has experienced issues, pm me. i believe the latest firmware to have a defect. i've now had two drives die hours after installing linux on them.
<myrrlyn>	it just won't touch its own monitor. at all.
<neffi>	i'm seeking more data points to show a trend
<hongouru>	i need to provide more space to home directory, how can i do that.. ?? i got / under sda7 and home under sda8
<hongouru>	any suggestion ?
<myrrlyn>	parted
<myrrlyn>	8 is a lot of partitions to have on one drive.
<hongouru>	myrrlyn, yes,... cause i got $shitdow$ installed for university matters...
<myrrlyn>	yikes
<hongouru>	is my quickest drive... that's why i installed everything to it
<myrrlyn>	mmm
<hongouru>	parted ?
<myrrlyn>	partition editor
<myrrlyn>	parted is cli, gparted should be graphical.
<hongouru>	ok
<hongouru>	better for assholes like me
<myrrlyn>	i feel ya buddy
<myrrlyn>	neffi: what if i kill the six agetty processes?
<diegoviola>	i want to test something as another user, is there a dummy user i can su to? so i don't have to create a new one
<earnestly>	myrrlyn: why do you have six?
<myrrlyn>	"/sbin/agetty --noclear tty1 linux" through tty6
<myrrlyn>	i have no idea they're just ... there
<earnestly>	uhuh.
<myrrlyn>	i assume those are the six terminals you can switch between when booting to multi-user instead of graphical
<earnestly>	sounds like you're not using arch
<berceanu_>	hey, does arch have the google talk plugin in its reps?
<hongouru>	i need to clear pacman cache
<earnestly>	berceanu_: is it found when searching for it?
<myrrlyn>	earnestly: i assure you i am
<morning_star>	heya arch folks ... how goes?
<binarycodes>	earnestly, xmonad-0.11.1: warning: haddock-interfaces: /usr/share/doc/i386-linux-ghc-7.10.1/xmonad-0.11.1/html/xmonad.haddock doesn't exist or isn't a file
<neffi>	myrrlyn: why not just reboot?
<binarycodes>	earnestly, getting this on pacman -s xmonad .... any idea on this?
<myrrlyn>	because it's running this irc presence as well as my website
<binarycodes>	i removed all packages depending on ghc and reinstalled them
<morning_star>	<3 xmonad
<neffi>	you run your website on arch? well, moving on. a reboot would be, what, 90 seconds of downtime?
<myrrlyn>	and i'm hoping i can figure out how to recover from these things without rebooting
<myrrlyn>	"website"
<earnestly>	binarycodes: it's benign
<myrrlyn>	static html pages and file download access
<neffi>	i reboot my server all the time. who cares if you get a few seconds of downtime? it doesn't sound like you're running a major site with millions of visitors
<myrrlyn>	mostly i was just hoping that there might be another solution besides "turn it off and back on again"
<sternmull>	earnestly: in fact the installation of udiskie enables pcmanfm to automount. thanks.
<myrrlyn>	ah well
<earnestly>	myrrlyn: have you posted any logs yet?
<myrrlyn>	there's nothing in journalctl -xe about it
<diegoviola>	what was the alternative to enable authentication with pulse, i know you can do that with paprefs, but i know there's also another way to do it manually
<diegoviola>	by editing configuration or loading a module, iirc?
<diegoviola>	so i can use audio as another user
<myrrlyn>	meh i'll just reboot and try to avoid ever shutting down enlightenment, i guess
<earnestly>	diegoviola: load a module, it's documented

<sysios>	hello, i have just started my arch and on lightdm have only white screen and black mouse pointer :/ how can i log in into my i3 session?
<sysios>	it has just happened
<lyonsb>	have patience?
<yumbox>	sysios: if you stop using lightdm and just add "exec i3" to .xinitrc, i3 starts when you start x
<sysios>	20min is enough?
<sysios>	yumbox: yes, know that but sometimes i am using default gnome, thats why there is lightdm preinstalled
<sysios>	and - for me - without any reason it stopped working
<yumbox>	sysios: do you still want to use lightdm?
<sysios>	but wokred till last hour
<junka>	namarrgon; http://ix.io/ibj
<sysios>	yumbox: not necessary, but will be good to have all config back :)
<yumbox>	sysios: then copy .xinitrc to .xinitrc.bak and do: echo "exec i3" > .xinitrc
<yumbox>	sysios: then (re)start x. if it still doesnt work, your i3 setup is wonky.
<sysios>	yumbox: will try. but problem is probably with login screen, not i3 itself
<namarrgon>	junka: post the full mpv error
<junka>	mpv: error while loading shared libraries: libxss.so.1: cannot open shared object file: no such file or directory
<qubitnerd>	"lightdm preinstalled" o.o
<sysios>	qubitnerd: antergos distro
<myrrlyn>	i don't know what i did
<yumbox>	junka: sudo pacman -syu libxss
<qubitnerd>	pkgfile says extra/libxss provides it
<myrrlyn>	but gdm seems to be working now, so, i should be able to lose window managers and recover w/o rebooting
<tom^>	sysios: is this #antergos ?
<yumbox>	junka: seems like mpv doesn't list a dependency, but it does need libxss
<sysios>	tom^: there is such a difference in pacman and packages that i can't get help regarding xorg-related stuff here?
<junka>	yumbox; it did not require it up until now
<yumbox>	junka: yeah, pretty weird.
<teraflop>	!give sysios co2
<junka>	and it wasnt even a mpv update
<phrik>	sysios: co is based on co2, go breath it
<tom^>	sysios: if you had installed arch you wouldnt have to be asking stuff you do now.
<tom^>	sysios: so i dont really care if there is a difference
<junka>	yumbox; the update was just 0.9.1-1 -> 0.9.1-2
<thrice>	it's probably an optional dep, and the dev built in a non-clean environment
<sysios>	ok thanks
<yumbox>	thrice: that makes sense.
<namarrgon>	junka: i686? testing?
<junka>	namarrgon; no x64 official repos
<junka>	stable ones
<thrice>	file a bug, and scold them for being a poor packager :-)
<ricaz>	when upgrading a graphics card, do i need to reinstall the nvidia package or anything?
<tom^>	ricaz: nope
<namarrgon>	can anyone with an updated 64bit non-testing system confirm the mpv breakage?
<qubitnerd>	wait
<qubitnerd>	i ran pacman -rscu libxss
<qubitnerd>	and mpv truns up in the list
<sheep>	which mpv breakage?
<qubitnerd>	(i didnt run it)
<sheep>	oh
<sheep>	i see
<qubitnerd>	soo somewhere along the chain mpv should pull libxss right ?
<beest>	i guess i should go ahead and update and look
<qubitnerd>	since rscu libxss removes mpv
<qubitnerd>	?
<thrice>	namarrgon: why do you say testing?  mpv exists only in community
<d_garbage>	pactree should show all the deps
<namarrgon>	thrice: non-testing
<thrice>	mpv isn't in testing
<qubitnerd>	d_garbage: thanks !
<namarrgon>	thrice: i never said "testing"
<tom^>	somewhere in the "chain" ? https://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/community.git/tree/trunk/pkgbuild?h=packages/mpv its directly in the depends array.
<thrice>	sure, but why specify "non-testing" at all?
<tom^>	so no idea what you guys are doing :p
<d_garbage>	me either
<edgy>	h, why am i getting thsese bluetooth errors: http://paste.pound-python.org/show/yvv3c0qhezqccmxlku1a/

<sternmull>	alt+backspace works fine (deletes words) in vtty. but when i use it in xterm or urxvt it does nothing (but messes up the terminal emulator, i can delete parts of the prompt afterwards...). any idea what is wrong?
<beest>	yup, mpv chugging along fine for me
<namarrgon>	thrice: to minimize the differences
<qubitnerd>	tom^: pacman -qi doesnt show it though
<tom^>	qubitnerd: mpv was updated 9 minutes ago
<tom^>	:p
<thrice>	it does here
<tom^>	it seems it was missing libxss before
<qubitnerd>	ahh
<edgy>	sternmull: why should xterm supports alt-bksp?
<taurgal>	would you recommend btrfs or ext4 for a ssd disk?
<earnestly>	tom^: missing is fine in that case as mpv's configure would simply not include it
<edgy>	taurgal: ext4
<sternmull>	edgy: it does in my experience. but on that new install it does not... no idea why.
<earnestly>	taurgal: do you want snapshots?
<tom^>	!shrug
<phrik>	¯\(º_o)/¯
<jelle>	xfs!
<tom^>	jelle: jfs ! the jellefilesystem
<thrice>	earnestly: waf probably autodetects though, so if it wasn't built in an a clean env
<earnestly>	thrice: yeah.  my personal mpv package works like that, it has no dependencies but just autodetects what it needs in a dirty environment
<taurgal>	earnestly: what do you mean?
<taurgal>	edgy: thanks
<thelemonman>	ahh fuckin libxss.so
<coolthingy500>	i have a guestion. how come people on different linux forums recommend not to use
<coolthingy500>	xfs as a root filesystem?
<mrelendig>	because they are stupid
<mrelendig>	and/or think it is still 2002
<mrelendig>	or think that having a fs you can't shrink as / is bad
<d_garbage>	qubitnerd, the other thing you can do is run namcap on the package. namcap /var/cache/pacman/pkg/mpv-0.9.1-2-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz does indeed show the warning: "mpv e: dependency libxss detected and not included"
<coolthingy500>	oh. well that's dumb. i'm not going to shrink a root partition in arch anyways.
<d_garbage>	isn't that something the build tools should do automatically? would seem handy thing
<thedudez0r>	hellozzle
<beest>	really?
<sheep>	d_garbage: mpv is working for me
<d_garbage>	sheep, sure working for me too, thing is about missing deps though
<sheep>	yeah, i have libxss installed
<mrelendig>	coolthingy500: i would use btrfs
<thrice>	so, the important thing is to have mpv -3 package
<qubitnerd>	sheep:but not pulled in when you installed mpvv
<thrice>	https://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/community.git/commit/trunk?h=packages/mpv&id=cd24b38ffe8841f8958bdc368f23c923fc46fc0c
<phrik>	title: svntogit/community.git - git clone of the 'community' repository (at projects.archlinux.org)
<d_garbage>	i'm just surprised packages don't get automatically checked with namcap in whatever build tools are used to add things to the repos, though there's probably some reason i guess?
<namarrgon>	but why didn't the missing lib show up with ldd?
<thrice>	namarrgon: ?
<kleinerdrache>	can you help me with xorg core dump?
<kleinerdrache>	https://gist.github.com/grauschnabel/20456325c0e51b6a4096#file-foo-text

<phrik>	title: foo.text (at gist.github.com)
<mrelendig>	kleinerdrache: what about it?
<thrice>	if you're using grep, it's xss
<namarrgon>	thrice: the output junka posted
<kleinerdrache>	mrelendig: i have many coredump of x11 but its hard to reproduce
<thrice>	i'm kind of surprised this discussion is still going on
<jasabella>	hi :)
<mrelendig>	that doesn't actually explain what you need help with
<kleinerdrache>	i use awesome windowmnager, but maybe emacs brakes it, or nautilus, ... i don't really know
<kleinerdrache>	mrelendig: what information do you need?
<namarrgon>	cykacykacyka: no idea run it with --help, see if there is a flag
<thrice>	namarrgon: his paste is truncated
<qubitnerd>	kleinerdrache: do you work with automobiles by any chance ? "emacs brakes it"
<jasabella>	are package names named according to packagename-maj.min.rev-archmodnumber? :)
<kleinerdrache>	qubitnerd: sorry, english is not my mothers language, please forgive at least some of my mistakes...
<thrice>	speaking of, my mpv just broke because of the lua update
<mrelendig>	jasabella: varies depending on upstream
<thrice>	hurray arch
<cykacykacyka>	namarrgon, it complains about x not being there, at least i got it to where x is up and running, sort of. gah, i hate old vga displays
<qubitnerd>	its cool kleinerdrache :)
<namarrgon>	cykacykacyka: what's the exact error?
<kleinerdrache>	mrelendig: how can i debug that better? what do you need to know?
<jasabella>	mrelendig... just trying to figure out what that last number is :)
<mrelendig>	jasabella: $pkgname-$epoch$pkgver-$pkgrel
<jasabella>	ahhhh ok
<mrelendig>	kleinerdrache: rebuilding with debug symbols might help
<jasabella>	package releaes
<jasabella>	chasing down release notes that's all :)
<cykacykacyka>	namarrgon, there is no error, the monitor doesn't support the default mode for 1280x1024_50.00 and 60.00
<kleinerdrache>	mrelendig: how would you do that?
<cykacykacyka>	1024x768 doesn't work either
<mrelendig>	!wiki debug
<phrik>	mrelendig: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/debug_-_getting_traces
<kleinerdrache>	thanks
<jasabella>	seems like liblua changed which meant other stuff got recompiled and updated :)
<mrelendig>	rebuilding x tend to take quite some time though
<arch-tk>	ncurses is awful
<arch-tk>	why can't it be better?
<arch-tk>	do i really need to actually write a better ncurses?
<mrelendig>	arch-tk: because teletypes from 1890
<mrelendig>	seriously, that is why
<arch-tk>	fucking teletypes
<mrelendig>	our terminals are crippeled due to all the baggage from 100+ years ago
<mrelendig>	and later
<arch-tk>	wait
<arch-tk>	1890
<arch-tk>	what?
<arch-tk>	they had screens in 1890?
<arch-tk>	or was this tape stuff?
<mrelendig>	arch-tk: yes, it was called "paper"
<arch-tk>	tape / paper
<wasamasa>	rofl
<arch-tk>	wow
<namarrgon>	cykacykacyka: you get that in the xorg log?
<arch-tk>	ncurses was for paper?
<thrice>	ok, the mpv pkgbuild has this:  0001-mpv-lua52.patch::https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/patch/5b085fd8b172648a03244d6546d130144b7870bf'
<thrice>	how is that supposed to work?
<arch-tk>	holy shit.
<mrelendig>	arch-tk: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/teleprinter
<phrik>	title: teleprinter - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (at en.wikipedia.org)
<mrelendig>	arch-tk: no, but the problem is not really ncurses itself, but the underlying terminals
<kleinerdrache>	mrelendig: but i think i have no chance...
<arch-tk>	right
<namarrgon>	thrice: what would make sense
<cykacykacyka>	namarrgon, i get that from the user telling me that the monitor is displaying an error message, the xorg log tells me that the driver cannot get the supported modes out of the monitor -> fglrx(0): cannot get edid information for crt1
<namarrgon>	i forgot ix has a limit
<mrelendig>	though esr must have been fucking drunk when he tought that y,x coordinates was a good thing
<wasamasa>	arch-tk: what do you think the "tele" in teletype is for
<mrelendig>	:p
<arch-tk>	wasamasa: teleportation obviously.
<wasamasa>	mrelendig: there are pieces of code in emacs where esr is ashamed of himself
<namarrgon>	cykacykacyka: did he regenerate the xorg.conf?
<namarrgon>	thrice: s/what/that/
<thrice>	how is it getting fetched?
<mrelendig>	wait, the y,x was before esr came in
<thrice>	2) the requested url returned error: 404 not found
<thrice>	==> error: failure while downloading 0001-mpv-lua52.patch
<wasamasa>	mrelendig: so don't worry, even he's got feelings
<arch-tk>	wasamasa: he wrote a good book
<mrelendig>	it is a leftover from the original curses i believe
<cykacykacyka>	namarrgon, i restored the xorg since it was using radeon drivers, hopefully i have a backup. damn, i hate myself now :(
<arch-tk>	y, x coordinates, because fuck you, that's why.
<mrelendig>	blame berkely
<arch-tk>	!blame berkley
<namarrgon>	cykacykacyka: what did you restore?
<mrelendig>	"the first curses library was developed at the university of california at berkeley, for a bsd operating system, around 1980 to support a screen-oriented game."
<thrice>	github.com/mpv-player/mpv/patch/5b085fd8b172648a03244d6546d130144b7870bf      is a 404
<cykacykacyka>	namarrgon, i didn't restore, i ran aticonf --initial, which left the old one there, but afaik, when i got there, xorg.conf.d/ was empty and xorg.conf wasn't even there
<arch-tk>	ahahah
<arch-tk>	they made it for a game :p
<arch-tk>	what game was that?
<wasamasa>	`hack`?
<arch-tk>	possibly?
<namarrgon>	cykacykacyka: move the old one away and run that again
<thrice>	or, does that link work for anyone else?
<cykacykacyka>	namarrgon, there are no old ones left, they've been successfully removed. it's just the fact that i don't recall the proper vertical and horizontal refresh frequencies, and it can't autodetect the propper display modes because the display itself is crap
<holomorph>	thrice: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/commit/5b085f.patch ?
<thrice>	that works, indeed
<cykacykacyka>	hmm, how do i specify the horizontal refresh rate in xorg.conf

<namarrgon>	cykacykacyka: however, i don't know how fglrx will interact with that
<yumbox>	junka: namarrgon: seems like it's fixed now.
<namarrgon>	if at all

<junka>	yes it does
<junka>	thank you guys :d

<holomorph>	how 2 fix soname rrorr

<wasamasa>	arch-tk: you typo'd
<arch-tk>	oh
<arch-tk>	lovely
<cl4p-tp>	clarjon1, going to test that one too! thanks!
<wasamasa>	"this "website" is now availible for laughing at[…]"
<wasamasa>	availible, huehuehue
<cykacykacyka>	namarrgon, maybe completely irrelevant to everyone, but i used aticonfig --vrefresh and --hsync and it created a 'working' xorg
<namarrgon>	nice
<wasamasa>	arch-tk: ok, that's the only typos i've spotted
<arch-tk>	wasamasa: one second
<namarrgon>	well, as nice as it gets with fglrx...
<cykacykacyka>	namarrgon, i'm guessing the next updates to xorg or the kernel or to gnome-shell will break it, right ? mesa/radeon drivers seem to be so much better at the moment for the particular card in question, except for the fact that some games require ogl4
<namarrgon>	cykacykacyka: gdm/gnome are a bit allergic to it. apart from the it tends to break on kernel and xorg update
<wasamasa>	arch-tk: i'd generally try to convey more with less text
<wasamasa>	arch-tk: the hint about mail addresses is superfluous for instance
<namarrgon>	cykacykacyka: which games require opengl 4?
<michaelp>	plasma 5 ati catalyst any idea what causing upper left corner of screen turn blue? when moving mouse that way.....    http://i.imgur.com/w34f6kq.jpg
<arch-tk>	wasamasa: all fixed
<wasamasa>	must be the screen being scared of dem pixels
<arch-tk>	wasamasa: this time i wrote a script to automate updating things
<cykacykacyka>	namarrgon, maybe not ogl4, but metro games require fglrx afaik
<p67>	can anyone explain what i am doing wrong? i'm trying to set up dm-crypt.. added everything from the wiki article (gummiboot modified with cryptdevice=uuidhere:lvm:allow-discards and root=/dev/mapper/volgrouphere).. but i keep booting directly in to arch where it cannot find the rootfs because it's not unlocked yet
<plasma>	stop using kde and stop highlighting me, would be a solution
<wasamasa>	lol
<namarrgon>	your own fault for not trademarking your nick all these years ago
<a124>	better not use nick "the"
<qubitnerd>	wasamasa: he he he ^
<michaelp>	plasma: you kde or a tv lol
<p67>	following https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/dm-crypt/system_configuration#mkinitcpio it seems i should be adding the following options to the bootloader? (cryptdevice=volgroup00:lvm)
<phrik>	title: dm-crypt/system configuration - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<a124>	i do not remember who pointed me yesterday to arch rollback machine, but found the kernel i needed, and sucessfully identified working copy of my code. now to port it upstream. and maybe backport for lts. but stupidly arch has lts 3.14, while ubuntu 3.13, and there were changes in between related to the section module resides in. but most people running ubuntu do not care about disk seek, [...]
<a124>	[...] workloads, silence, or are running virtual.
<arch-tk>	wasamasa: better?
<scimmia>	arch follows upstream lts, ubuntu does whatever the hell they want
<wasamasa>	arch-tk: let me check
<arch-tk>	(force refresh of course.)
<cykacykacyka>	hahaha, it didn't last long, xorg crashed already
<diegoviola>	why is that when you install a new kernel on arch and you for example plug your usb headset it doesn't work until you reboot to the new kernel, is this because you can't load a module from another kernel to the current kernel?
<sudokode>	arch doesn't really have a concept of lts
<diegoviola>	not an arch specific problem at all, right?
<a124>	so thanks to.. grawity
<wasamasa>	arch-tk: yeah, better
<jelle>	diegoviola: new kernel removes all old modules
<scimmia>	diegoviola, yes, and kind of
<sudokode>	the kernel is mostly just there because some people really can't run the stable kernel
<namarrgon>	cykacykacyka: did it give you a trace?
<diegoviola>	jelle: right, thanks
<scimmia>	diegoviola, it's arch specific in that pacman is what removes all of the old modules
<wasamasa>	arch-tk: i could imagine it to be even shorter if you'd use some hyperlinks more, but it's fine the way it is
<diegoviola>	thanks
<sudokode>	arch's lts kernel updates much faster than a normal distro's would
<sudokode>	plus if you're using lts, it's likely you don't even want kernel upgrades often
<earnestly>	arch's/upstreams
<sudokode>	earnestly: i mean the actual base
<sudokode>	kernel.org puts out a lot of kernel upgrades for lts and it has multiple lts versions available
<sudokode>	but arch will probably be on 3.18 soon for lts
<scimmia>	sudokode, no, they won't
<sudokode>	no?
<a124>	i honestly use latest stable arch usually, and alike. but for server workload it may come to help, but first there would need to be anyone to actually want to use it.
<a124>	sudokode 3.18? where you saw that?
<scimmia>	arch tends to folllow greg k-h's lts
<kinokoio>	who uses qt5? http://github.com/kinokoio/sbrowser
<phrik>	title: kinokoio/sbrowser · github (at github.com)
<muchoz>	i have a vhd file of a windows backup on a hard drive in my pc that has linux on a partition on my ssd. is it possible to image the vhd file using dd to the unallocated space on the ssd and add windows to grub?
<sudokode>	hm
<scimmia>	er, greg k-h
<sudokode>	you said that
<scimmia>	yeah, that's what i said
<scimmia>	i thought i typod it, i switch the letters too often
<sudokode>	hm
<junka>	is autodefrag a good idea?
<sudokode>	but if you look back at the lts updates overall, they do upgrade pretty fast
<jelle>	well security updates prolly
<a124>	junka i have no experience, but i presume brtfs, if i had hdd i would experimentally use it and of course safeguard my data somewhere else.
<thaweatherman>	anyone here use sl4a with tasker? im having issues setting a tasker variable and no one in other channels is answering
<sudokode>	jelle: no not revisions
<sudokode>	base upgrades
<sudokode>	3.10 -> 3.14 and the like
<a124>	3.18 would be nice. i wrote the kernel module for 3.18.
<sudokode>	heh
<a124>	anyone familliar with io_priorities? io_prio groups etc.
<jelle>	sudokode: whatever i rather bleed fully
<sudokode>	jelle: bleeding edge long term support
<sudokode>	belts
<sudokode>	the most ironic distro model ever
<a124>	the thing is.. most stuff in computing does not much account for mechanical properties of hardware. harddrives in this case. they just use time and that is derived from some statistical values at best.
<sudokode>	not much in a computer is mechanical
<sudokode>	at least anymore
<a124>	well the harddrive that is.
<earnestly>	!mechanicalsympathy
<sudokode>	that's the last thing

<sudokode>	aside from the fans and the tray
<a124>	unless you use ssd. also fans.
<sudokode>	well, the optical drive overall
<sudokode>	a124: there aren't fans in an ssd
<earnestly>	sudokode: is a transistor not mechanical?
<sudokode>	unless you mean a portable case
<a124>	cpu xd
<earnestly>	or is mechanical only things which have moving parts?
<sudokode>	earnestly: exactly
<sudokode>	a transistor is an electrical component
<sudokode>	made up of matter obviously, but it doesn't operate mechanically
<earnestly>	okay, just to get on the same definition, that's fine
<sudokode>	mhm
<earnestly>	(more specifically, you refer to mechanical systems as those which use force and movement)
<sudokode>	a124: yeah, i said that
<a124>	what i ran into was .. eccentric guys and problem of noisy hdd and abusive seeking. one scheduler gave me interactivity while compiling, but not the silence or being gentle to harddrive. so those two things came together and i gone into the kernel dungeons.
<earnestly>	which is fine
<sudokode>	well, fans in general
<sudokode>	earnestly: sounds specific enough

<muchoz>	does this need to be placed in /etc/fstab? https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ntfs-3g#linux_compatible_permissions
<phrik>	title: ntfs-3g - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<sheep>	p67: it looks like it should work, though i'm not sure if the systemd hook is necessary
<linux_dream>	yeah in the bios nothing changed since i installed arch stuff
<mrelendig>	muchoz: internal disk?
<mrelendig>	linux_dream: secureboot enabled?
<linux_dream>	disabled
<scimmia>	linux_dream, does efibootmgr list grub?
<muchoz>	mrelendig: what do you mean?
<linux_dream>	what i didn't do is install gummiboot like there: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/beginners%27_guide#for_uefi_motherboards
<p67>	sheep: yeah, but for some reason it's just not kicking the encrypt hook off
<phrik>	title: beginners' guide - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<smirky>	what are you guys discussing, what bios setting?
<linux_dream>	i don't know scimmia , how can i check this out?
<linux_dream>	(i did installed efibootmgr)
<scimmia>	linux_dream, booted to the live system, just run efibootmgr
<sheep>	p67: the only other thing i can think is that there's a typo somewhere
<scimmia>	it should give you a list of boot entries in the nvram and the order they will be loaded
<mrelendig>	muchoz: is the ntfs partition on a internal disk?
<muchoz>	mrelendig: it is.
<linux_dream>	ok scimmia, yeah grub is listed
<linux_dream>	windows and arch too are listed
<mrelendig>	muchoz: then use fstab
<muchoz>	mrelendig: i also need to change the uuid, right? it doesn't have a uuid.
<mrelendig>	muchoz: i would forget about using posix permissions on it though
<scimmia>	linux_dream, ok, is it in the boot order before windows?
<muchoz>	mrelendig: just ignore that then?
<mrelendig>	muchoz: and also try to store as little data as possible on it, since there is no sane fsck for ntfs
<toogy>	i have a thinkpad x230, i recently bought a new battery that charges to 100% (normal). thing is, it drops from 47% to 5% in something like 5seconds
<muchoz>	mrelendig: it's from an old pc.
<toogy>	(acpi driver)
<toogy>	i don't know what the heck is happening ...
<linux_dream>	1st is boot from usb, then windows, then arch then grub then efi usb device then internal hard disk
<muchoz>	mrelendig: there is a vhd file on it that i need to put on the unallocated part of this disk.
<scimmia>	linux_dream, there you go
<mrelendig>	toogy: you bought the battery from china?
<diegoviola>	toogy: that's insane
<toogy>	it's a lenovo battery
<wasamasa>	toogy: i hope the battery didn't cost much
<mrelendig>	original?
<toogy>	wasamasa: 40€
<mrelendig>	if so, rma it
<diegoviola>	toogy: sounds like a broken battery
<linux_dream>	i see scimmia, so i'd put grub just below usb hard drive right?
<mrelendig>	either really broken battery, or just the electronics on it that is broken
<toogy>	:/
<scimmia>	linux_dream, yep
<linux_dream>	i prefer to boot from usb when possible first
<linux_dream>	ok and how can i change the order? :)
<mrelendig>	or you got a aaaa battery in a big case
<wasamasa>	lol
<mrelendig>	filled with concrete
<mrelendig>	because china
<wasamasa>	sounds like the usb stick inside the hdd case
<tom^>	:p
<mrelendig>	aaaa or aaaaa cells
<wasamasa>	with two nuts to make it feel heavy enough :p
<mnathani_>	what packages are required for gui / xorg server?
<wasamasa>	ok, that sounded more obscene than i wanted it to be
<mrelendig>	aaaa cells are used in 9v batteries :d
<toogy>	does it really happen? :p
<holomorph>	!give mnathani_ wiki xorg
<phrik>	mnathani_: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xorg
<mnathani_>	i installed xorg-server, cinnamon, xorg-xinit
<toogy>	it's a 9 cells battery
<arch-tk>	mnathani_: that's probably it
<thatbrod>	hello. i'm having trouble understanding login managers. when i try to login, a console appears for a second or two before slim shows up. can i make it so only slim appears?
<mrelendig>	or lr61
<tom^>	toogy: we are still interested from where you got this battery :p
<arch-tk>	mnathani_: unless cinnamon needs something else
<mrelendig>	which are basicly aaaa
<heftig>	mrelendig: some 9v batteries
<toogy>	yeah i bought it from someone who cells lenovo stuff on a p2p french website
<heftig>	the ones i opened contained 6 flat cells in a row, not 6 long cells
<mrelendig>	heftig: yep
<tom^>	toogy: a reliable store?
<mrelendig>	heftig: most of the cheaper ones uses aaaa/lr61
<mnathani_>	arch-tk: presently i get errors like : xinit: giving up
<mnathani_>	unable to connect to x server: connection refused
<tom^>	toogy: because it sounds like you got china stuff
<arch-tk>	mnathani_: did you write a .xinitrc ?
<mnathani_>	server error
<mnathani_>	i did
<mrelendig>	because they can just buy them almost for free from the shinsen market
<toogy>	tom^: not reliable
<arch-tk>	mnathani_: can i see it?
<p67>	sheep: i removed systemd and now it seems to ask me for my pass.. but now my keyboard isn't working. but that's no biggie.
<mrelendig>	wrap some tape around, add two contacts
<toogy>	tom^: so you're probably right
<mnathani_>	exec cinnamon-session
<mrelendig>	and sell with a 50% profit
<p67>	sheep:  as in the systemd hook, ofcourse.
<toogy>	does anyone know where i can get a good battery?
<sheep>	p67: you might just need the keyboard hook, or whatever it is
<toogy>	150€ on lenovo's website...
<mrelendig>	toogy: rma the one you got
<mrelendig>	toogy: get a new one
<toogy>	mrelendig: for free?
<mrelendig>	unless you are in a country with no consumer laws
<mnathani_>	arch-tk: exec cinnamon-session
<mrelendig>	like the us
<tom^>	heh
<arch-tk>	mnathani_: and you run startx or xinit?
<linux_dream>	any idea on how i can change the boot order (and put grub before windows)?
<mnathani_>	startx
<toogy>	mrelendig: i'm in france :)
<arch-tk>	mnathani_: weird
<mrelendig>	then the shop should replace it for free
<arch-tk>	mnathani_: i have no idea about cinamon, but with a normal wm that would be enough
<toogy>	mrelendig: i bought my computer on lenovo's french website
<toogy>	not in a store
<arch-tk>	so simply put, i have no clue, keep asking, someone else is bound to know
<toogy>	x230 are custom made
<sheep>	linux_dream: your system setup menu (i.e. the one you have to mash esc or f12 or whatever when the system starts)
<toogy>	mrelendig: but thanks :d
<linux_dream>	the bios sheep?
<homerj>	that's half the fun
<homerj>	f2, del, f8, f12
<homerj>	who knows?!
<homerj>	it's bios roulette
<sheep>	linux_dream: yes, but it's not called a bios anymore.  'firmware' is more accurate
<linux_dream>	ok
<homerj>	then the keyboard starts beeping from all the keys you hit

<d_garbage>	linux_dream, yes but didn't you mount it to the wrong place last time?
<linux_dream>	oh right i did that too elken
<linux_dream>	maybe yes d_garbage i'm confuedd with the path
<linux_dream>	i guess that's the problem
<linux_dream>	is it /mnt/boot/efi or /boot/efi
<linux_dream>	i mounted /  to /mnt
<kinokoio>	linux_dream: is /mnt/boot/efi, because that's your system
<linux_dream>	the command of elken only work with /mnt/boot/efi
<linux_dream>	ok
<linux_dream>	installation finished, no error reported
<d_garbage>	it doesn't say that though?
<elken>	it works with wherever /boot/efi is mounted
<muchoz>	elken: well if i mount using ntfs-3g i get the following error: retty crappy laptop overall
<muchoz>	21:53 -!- lmrp_ [~weechat@cable-78.29.238.16.coditel.net] has joined #archlinux
<linux_dream>	ok that worked.  now what?
<muchoz>	21:53 < muchoz> here is the log related to it in journalctl: http://ix.io/ibx
<linux_dream>	reboot or generate some files
<muchoz>	i have no idea how i ended up pasting my previous post...
<linux_dream>	do i have to generate the grub.cfg file again?
<d_garbage>	it says mount the $esp as /boot not /boot/efi at least that's how i'm reading it
<linux_dream>	yeah d_garbage but that's just a "bad" tip
<elken>	d_garbage, it depends where the files are
<muchoz>	well here is the error i get with ntfs-3g now: http://ix.io/ibx
<linux_dream>	old pc needed it on /boot
<linux_dream>	now not anymore
<ludat>	will arch get cargo (rust package manager) in the repos?
<linux_dream>	elken do i have to regenerate the grub .cfg file?
<d_garbage>	oh well, good luck
<elken>	linux_dream, could be drive issues then, run smart tests
<elken>	wp
<elken>	yes, new grub.cfg
<elken>	muchoz, could be drive issues, run smart tests
<d_garbage>	muchoz, have you tried running a filesystem check on it from windows?
<elken>	under esp/grub
<elken>	not /boot/grub
<elken>	/mnt/boot/efi/ wherever it's mounted
<linux_dream>	oh
<muchoz>	d_garbage: well somehow i partionited the windows partition. i want it back, heh..
<elken>	otherwise the efi loader won't see it
<muchoz>	there's a backup on that drive.
<linux_dream>	oh.... i didn't know this elken
<linux_dream>	ok done
<elken>	does say on the wiki page
<linux_dream>	it sees the 3 images
<linux_dream>	now i can reboot?
<elken>	reboot and try again
<linux_dream>	thx
<elken>	:)
<elken>	efi is fun times
<linux_dream>	lol not for me
<d_garbage>	muchoz, did you resize the partition at some point?
<elken>	http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sarcasm ;)
<phrik>	title: sarcasm | definition of sarcasm by merriam-webster (at www.merriam-webster.com)
<linux_dream>	windows again booting, no grub
<d_garbage>	muchoz, also is there anything actually on there? maybe try reformating it?
<d_garbage>	anyway, i need a drink
<youngwolf>	bspwm or i3? which is better and active?
<elken>	better is subjective, i think i3 is more active
<elken>	use both, see which you prefer
<linux_dream>	i'm out of ideas to make grub show up
<muchoz>	d_garbage: i didn't resize it. i'm not reformatting it because there is 2tb of valuable data on it.
<linux_dream>	with bootefimgr i can see that grub is below both windows and arch
<muchoz>	the most important files still backed up, but still.
<linux_dream>	if there was an easy way to modify the order i'd be happy to try it
<linux_dream>	with bootefimgr
<d_garbage>	muchoz, well then i'd probably check it for errors then, from windows is probably best if you can. i think you can check it on linux but i'm not sure about repair.
<elken>	there's a simple repair iirc
<muchoz>	d_garbage: do i use fsck or something?
<elken>	windows is best though
<sweetstache>	back when i used ubuntu, i have had issues installing a different window manager than the default one. is arch any better at handling multiple window managers?
<d_garbage>	muchoz, i imagine so
<namarrgon>	sweetstache: it works just fine
<muchoz>	well the problem is that for some odd reason my usb bootables of windows do not boot at all.
<d_garbage>	make sure it's a read only check though (probably by default but make sure anyway)
<muchoz>	i was first gonna install a new windows and then i can overwrite that os with the vhd file from withing windows itself.
<d_garbage>	might as well check the smart report as well as someone else pointed out
<muchoz>	d_garbage: how do i do that? i can't find anything about it. never done this.
<elken>	muchoz, what de are you on?
<d_garbage>	smartctl -a <device> for hdd
<muchoz>	elken: i3
<muchoz>	well no env actually.
<elken>	yeah just use smartctl then
<elken>	install smartmontools
<elken>	i think
<d_garbage>	not often very usefull but worth a look probably
<d_garbage>	!pkgfile
<phrik>	pkgfile is a tool to find out what package owns a file, even if said package is not installed. pacman -s pkgfile; pkgfile -u
<elken>	i use pkgfile to implement a basic cnf tool :3
<elken>	it's awesome
<muchoz>	well smart is disabled somehow on the drive...
<linux_dream>	elken i think i could solve my problem if i knew how to change the boot order with efibootmgr.  there are some stuff in arch forum
<muchoz>	it is available though.
<elken>	i'm not using it so idk how to configure it
<elken>	re: efibootmgr
<linux_dream>	ok
<d_garbage>	shouldn't you get a menu or something? bit rubbish if not
<elken>	"bit rubbish" accurately describes efi ;)
<addk_>	linux_dream: efibootmgr -v to list and efibootmgr -o 000x,000x to sort
<linux_dream>	yep
<linux_dream>	i'll try this
<linux_dream>	have to reboot several times in a row, coz the prompt won't appear in 2 out of 3 times
<addk_>	but you get same experience in bios so not really helping here?
<d_garbage>	maybe you have to press a key to get a boot menu or something. i know you can do that on this machine (bios) to change the boot order on the fly
<linux_dream>	booting process gets stuck about 50 to 60% of times i reboot
<linux_dream>	sometimes it works, and i do nothing different
<d_garbage>	rebooting a lot isn't very good for your system, fyi
<d_garbage>	stresses the hdd/power etc
<addk_>	where does it stuck?
<muchoz>	d_garbage: okay. i enabled smart and tried to mount it. it didn't work and i checked the smart errors, it says there were no errors logged.
<linux_dream>	it depends addk, sometimes generating hardware stuff, other times at other moments , sometimes on the "welcome to arch linux" part
<linux_dream>	now it just worked
<elken>	muchoz, man smartctl
<elken>	run the tests
<d_garbage>	muchoz, yeah smartctl -a <device> and look at the figures, you'll probably need to google what they mean
<d_garbage>	it's not always hugely helpful anyway so don't waste too much time on it, imo
<elken>	gnome disks displays the info a bit better
<elken>	you get tooltips of every file
<elken>	*field
<muchoz>	elken: it's already testing the drive. it'll be done in a sec (short one).
<muchoz>	the test completed without errors as expected.
<digit>	know any archlinux users that want elite:dangerous native on linux?  pass this on, thnx.  https://www.change.org/p/frontier-developments-plc-port-elite-dangerous-to-linux-desktop

<muchoz>	i don't have a windows. my system for some reason doesn't let me boot from the bootable usb drives i create with windows. linux bootable usb's work just fine.

<phrik>	don't just say it doesn't work. give the exact error. if you think that more information than a line or two will be useful, see !pastebin

<junka>	elken; there is no community in categories
<mrelendig>	junka: wrong

<d_garbage>	never heard of 'hib' before
<earnestly>	d_garbage: humble indy bundle
<linux_dream>	no i cannot d_garbage
<d_garbage>	ahh
<linux_dream>	i think i'll create an account in arch forum and seek help there, this is my last chance
<junka>	why not
<junka>	:p
<d_garbage>	you sound really stressed about it, it's supposed to be fun! :)
<namarrgon>	it is fun, the df kind of fun
<d_garbage>	heh
<linux_dream>	i'm asked: what is the output of date -u +%v$(uname)|sha256sum|sed 's/\w//g'   ?    i put this into the terminal, it returns 4d3a74202ef5ef3726c9c2c7286c53f8136d6d97bd4baac071fa0947aa0f9c95     , arch forum says it's wrong so i can't register
<mixedcase>	can someone tell me why in the seven hells is the [core] kernel compiled with [testing] gcc?
<namarrgon>	linux_dream: untick the dst checkbox and try again
<earnestly>	mixedcase: reasons
<linux_dream>	i have it unticked namarrgon
<namarrgon>	linux_dream: then tick it
<mixedcase>	earnestly: well, i hope it's good enough for breaking vmware.
<linux_dream>	i don't use dst in my time zone
<krumelmonster>	d_garbage: yes it's humbleindiebundle but the problem is simply that the above line in my dlagents array $(echo %u | cut -c 7-) won't trim the first 7chars of %u.
<linux_dream>	ok that worked thanks namarrgon
<coolbeans51>	hi guys. how do i get dns working in arch? got network conection just no dns thanks
<earnestly>	mixedcase: open-vm-tools works fine
<mrelendig>	coolbeans51: depends on how you set up the network
<mixedcase>	earnestly: just looked it up. didn't know this existed, thanks for the tip. will give it a try.
<d_garbage>	never used it. can you download manually instead?
<d_garbage>	krumelmonster, ^
<coolbeans51>	mrelendig: basically i have a router doing nat, dhcp and also providing local dns (i think). is there a daemon or something that can update resolve.conf to point to my router?
<mrelendig>	i mean if you use dhcpcd, networkmanager, networkd, by hand or what

<d_garbage>	krumelmonster, sure
<mixedcase>	earnestly: didn't work, will try to see if a reboot does it.
<coolbeans51>	mrelendig: i'm using networkd for dhcp
<mrelendig>	coolbeans51: read the wiki then
<mrelendig>	enable systemd-resolved.service
<mrelendig>	ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
<mrelendig>	enable and start*
<c0de1>	hi
<mixedcase>	earnestly: well that did nothing. vmware is still asking me to compile.
<c0de1>	mixedcase, using vmware workstation?
<mixedcase>	c0de1: correct.
<c0de1>	what is the issue?
<c0de1>	sorry, i can't see history
<coolbeans51>	mrelendig:  hmmm thank you. on closer inspection, i do see that this is in the wiki. anyway its working now thanks
<mixedcase>	well, the kernel was compiled with [testing]'s gcc instead of [core]'s for some reason. so i can't compile the vmware modules.
<mixedcase>	it's asking me for gcc 5.1
<luminarys>	anyone here familiar with setting up rtorrent + rutorrent with nginx on arch?
<mixedcase>	and i ain't going to be enabling testing anytime soon
<c0de1>	mixedcase, download gcc 5.1.0, extract and choose the gcc executable from there
<c0de1>	there is no need to use testing repo
<c0de1>	i litterally just did this a few moments ago :)
<mixedcase>	c0de1: is there a binary download somewhere?

<mixedcase>	d'oh
<mixedcase>	of course. thank you c0de1
<c0de1>	from my experience, choosing "gcc" does not work
<c0de1>	you have to choose x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc
<mixedcase>	c0de1: will do.
<d_garbage>	or jsut rebuild the kernel
<d_garbage>	just*
<d_garbage>	!abs
<phrik>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/arch_build_system
<c0de1>	there is no need to rebuild the kernel
<d_garbage>	!shrug
<phrik>	¯\(º_o)/¯
<d_garbage>	doesn't affect me i build my own kernels anyway
<elken>	mr edgy over here

<mixedcase>	d_garbage: custom kernels bring all the grills to the yard amirite or amirite.
<d_garbage>	i wouldn't call linux-ck exactly 'edgy'
<elken>	bleeding edgy
<dacoit>	ubuntu 6.10
<d_garbage>	it's often behind linux
<d_garbage>	so no, not really
<c0de1>	to be fair, arch should have built 4.0.x with 4.9.2
<elken>	really? i thought ck was pretty good
<d_garbage>	it is but you have to wait for the patches
<c0de1>	*maintainers
<d_garbage>	he is
<mixedcase>	i just noticed repo-ck updated back to 4.0. noice. thanks for the reminder.
<earnestly>	spaceballs is crap, srsly
<mixedcase>	will be switching back
<elken>	i remember him being pretty quick with patches, i haven't use in a few years
<d_garbage>	yeah few days ago
<d_garbage>	seems to be fine here
<c0de1>	mixedcase, , did it work?
<mixedcase>	finishing download
<muchoz>	does someone know why my windows bootable usb's are not working? it works just fine with any other linux bootable usb. when i select to boot from the usb, it ignores it and boots to the ssd.
<mittttens>	is there a way to get everything else (i.e. irc) to not stop working when something is streaming/downloading?
<mittttens>	like to distribute traffic/bandwidth better?
<mrelendig>	mittttens: ##windows
<muchoz>	i have tried to write the bootable from linux, osx and windows to no avail. i've tried 2 different isos too.
<mixedcase>	c0de1: bingo, it worked :3 many thanks
<mrelendig>	mittttens: qos
<c0de1>	mixedcase, awesome. remember to check https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vmware-patch/ in future

<adrian_1908>	hello. i would like create a bootable usb stick with arch on it (for a regular installation onto my netbook). i saw that unetbootin offers arch in its list of "automated" usb installations, but read on arch's wiki that this tool messes up when working with user provided iso images. does anyone have knowledge about this?
<dacoit>	adrian_1908: unetbootin sucks
<dacoit>	adrian_1908: dd works perfectly
<mrelendig>	unetbootin also doesn't support uefi
<plasma>	adrian_1908: what dacoit says
<mrelendig>	which makes it useless on any modern hardware
<adrian_1908>	i see, thanks for the information. i'll try it with dd then.
<coolbeans51>	hi guys do u recommend lxde for use with arch?
<mrelendig>	i don't recommend lxde for use with anything
<mrelendig>	except torturing people
<nickhu>	is the signature for infinality "invalid" for everyone else too?
<dacoit>	that bad huh
<coolbeans51>	mrelendig: why is that ?
<nickhu>	i've reset the pacman key db twice now
<coolbeans51>	what is better in that case? thanks very much
<nickhu>	coolbeans51: xfce is quite nice
<mrelendig>	you have not spesified any use case

<plasma>	:)
<elken>	kinokoio, i sent you a pr :)
<plasma>	whats so funny about? please explain
<mixedcase>	elken: and i wouldn't have it any other way. these guys who pushed the idea of "pirate boxes" really have their heart in the right place.
<halosghost>	plasma: after everything the eos devs have said lately, i cannot say i would ever use anything they ever make ever
<halosghost>	:)
<plasma>	halosghost: that was particulary?
<elken>	halosghost, let's not discuss eos anymore :p
<plasma>	and what's eos?
<intelfx>	hi guys. do anybody use
<elken>	elementary os
<halosghost>	plasma: duckduckgo is your friend
<intelfx>	systemd's kernel-install on arch?
<mixedcase>	halosghost: eos =/= enlightenment, not by a long shot
<elken>	duckduckgo hype
<dacoit>	bing it
<plasma>	hearing from it for the first time
<plasma>	i would say bodhi is the way to go if you want it easy
<plasma>	but arent we here on #archlinux ?
<halosghost>	mixedcase: made by the same people
<elken>	exactly, let's talk about how shit arch is, not eos
<halosghost>	phrik: as
<phrik>	arch sucks™
<elken>	!ass
<phrik>	arch *strategically* sucks™
<halosghost>	meh
<halfwit>	someone should really grab archlinux.sucks
<halosghost>	phrik: es
<halosghost>	aww
<phrik>	everything sucks™
<d_garbage>	funny i just saw bddhi the other day, someone was trying to get linux running on a 1996 era computer and that was one that came up under 'good for older hardware'
<halosghost>	yay, it's still there
<elken>	pessimist ;)
<d_garbage>	bodhi*
<halosghost>	halfwit: it's like a bajillion $us or something
<luminarys>	no one here familiar with setting up rutorrent + nginx on arch?
<plasma>	d_garbage: with the legacy version, this fits
<mixedcase>	halosghost: i'm pretty sure they're not. maybe you're confusing pantheon with enlightenment. pantheon is eos' desktop environment. enlightenment is a completely different project, by the enlightenment foundation.
<coolbeans51>	plasma ok thanks ill take a look
<earnestly>	halosghost: eos isn't related in any way to enlightenment, whatsoever
<plasma>	hmm as far as i have read, eos has to do zero with enlightenment
<d_garbage>	earnestly, "hmm"? :d
<halosghost>	mixedcase, earnestly: ahh, my mistake then
<d_garbage>	made me smile
<earnestly>	halosghost: assuming eos, you mean, elementary os
<halosghost>	plasma: ^ see my last comment
<halosghost>	earnestly: i suppose
<earnestly>	d_garbage: i didn't know what i was commiting
<mixedcase>	halosghost: i can see why you might be confused. enlightenment is usually shortened to exx, with the xs being the version. elementary os is shortened to eos
<mixedcase>	so there's a pattern there.
<halosghost>	mixedcase: i imagine that lead to part of my confusion
<halosghost>	but then, i haven't been in the realm of des for so long now “they all look the same to me.”
<halosghost>	so, you know
<halosghost>	i probably just shouldn't talk about them at all :p
<earnestly>	halosghost: the saddest thing about pantheon is they developed on ubuntu.  this wouldn't be so bad except they now depend on ubuntu's own flavour of those common libraries
<earnestly>	the upshot is you need half the ubuntu specific ecosystem to use pantheon anywhere else.
<halosghost>	earnestly: sounds like a party

<teraflop>	oh boy im scared, that's the systemd unit file of lightdm (lightdm.service) in debian jessie http://ix.io/ic6nano

<teraflop>	oh boy im scared, that's the systemd unit file of lightdm (lightdm.service) in debian jessie http://ix.io/ic6
<teraflop>	srry*
<muchoz>	heftig, so i'm fucked?
<kilo`byte>	heftig: evening.
<heftig>	muchoz: you may be able to convert *all* partitions into logical ones
<plasma>	muchoz: you could repartition and adjust grub.cfg
<heftig>	kilo`byte: sorry, just disregard that one, please :p
<kilo`byte>	no problem :p
<muchoz>	ugh i hate windows...
<kilo`byte>	am i not allowed to be nice though? :o
<tazmain>	mmm i wonder if 100 tabs in 3 windows of firefox is too much for it.
<kilo`byte>	muchoz: can fully understand you
<tazmain>	or 200-300 it seems
<heftig>	muchoz: the usual default of fdisk/cfdisk creates a large gap at the beginning of the disk
<kristof>	did we have a change regarding ssh lately?
<heftig>	muchoz: so that way you can convert the first partition and any following partitions into logical partitions, by making the extended partition start one sector in front of the first partition
<muchoz>	heftig, i partitioned the 4 primary partitions with parted.
<muchoz>	and i don't want to reformat.
<muchoz>	not again

<earnestly>	jupelius: ah
<muchoz>	i feel retarded having to ask about partitions...
<jupelius>	earnestly: like if i compare strace output of normal hello world written in c and in ponylang
<heftig>	muchoz: pastebin the output of sfdisk -l /dev/<disk>
<earnestly>	jupelius: yeah, it will be
<muchoz>	heftig, alright. let me boot into arch first again.
<heftig>	muchoz: note that you will also lose the ability to boot arch when you install windows
<heftig>	you'll have to reinstall the bootloader

<meskarune>	oh phrik ping lol
<earnestly>	jupelius: i mean, if you really wanted to keep it small: write(1, &somestr, sizeof(somestr)); :p

<muchoz>	i don't want to do set my arch distro up for the third time this week.
<kilo`byte>	or they are simply too stupid for gpz
<kilo`byte>	*gpt
<coolbeans51>	muchoz: have you got a ext partition yet? that's the first step after you boot he live cd
<homerj>	i don't even know if i 100% remember how to install arch at this point
<heftig>	muchoz: throw away swap and home and recreate them as logical partitions
<earnestly>	kilo`byte: windows 7 and up support gpt.  uefi needed for booting, otherwise data disks
<homerj>	i installed it so long ago
<heftig>	muchoz: that will free up one primary partition
<kilo`byte>	earnestly: i said older :p
<kilo`byte>	ie win xp
<muchoz>	coolbeans51: why do i need to boot into a livecd? i'm in arch without a livecd.
<earnestly>	kilo`byte: not sure about vista, probably not.  definately not xp
<kilo`byte>	but i think that doesn't support those disk sizes anyways
<homerj>	it's really nice to be able to have this install as long as i had it
<jushur>	homerj: its not like it has goten any harder.
<coolbeans51>	muchoz so u already installed arch, or not? sorry dont understand
<kilo`byte>	i once connected my old 1.3 tb disk to an xp machine and it did not work
<kinokoio>	muchoz, grub-install <part> && grub-mkconfig
<homerj>	it was tedious back when i wasn't on arch, have to pretty much reinstall every new release of a distro
<muchoz>	coolbeans51: yes.
<homerj>	although there were upgrade paths, they mostly screwed up somehow
<coolbeans51>	muchoz: so now your trying to get a bootloader working, correct?
<muchoz>	coolbeans51: i'm trying to install windows 7 on the unallocated space. but there already are 4 partitions.

<heftig>	muchoz: size the extended partition so that you have enough space left at the end of the drive for windows to create one primary partition as c:
<heftig>	muchoz: then you can fill the rest of the space with logical partitions as wanted
<coolbeans51>	muchoz:  oh yeah. in mbr/bios you can only have 4 partitions
<kilo`byte>	i eventually gotta remove the ntfs part i made on my external disk. didn't know windows only looked at the first part for external disks
<muchoz>	heftig: i can just do this from within arch, right?
<heftig>	muchoz: yes
<heftig>	logout, login as root, unmount /home, swapoff, then repartition and reformat
<jupelius>	earnestly: i wonder when they're ready to rewrite the whole thing in pony itself
<muchoz>	heftig: but if i throw away /home and the swap, do i need to edit /etc/fstab again, yes, right?
<coolbeans51>	heftig:  surely you can use the windows livecd to format?
<muchoz>	coolbeans51: no
<heftig>	coolbeans51: no
<earnestly>	jupelius: they want to be self-hosting eventually
<heftig>	muchoz: depends on how it looks like
<heftig>	if you used labels you can just reuse the same labels
<muchoz>	wait, brb. i'm gonna connect on my mac and log in here as root without a dm running.
<heftig>	uuids can be set at mkfs time as well
<muchoz>	alright.
<linux_dream>	hey guys, for those who know about my installation problem(s), should i post in the newbie forum or installating forum in arch forum?
<muchoz>	so unmount /home and turn swap off first, right?
<heftig>	yes

<muchoz>	how do i disable the swap?
<heftig>	muchoz: swapoff -a
<muchoz>	lol i just got it :p
<muchoz>	alright now delete the partitions...
<jupelius>	"if your program compiles, it won't crash." that's a pretty big promise
<halosghost>	jupelius: well, that might be true for haskell
<halosghost>	jupelius: maybe
<halosghost>	for other langs, of course, that's false
<heftig>	muchoz: when you create the extended partition, either leave space after sda2 or before the disk end for windows to create the last primary partition
<halosghost>	are you talking about ponylang?
<jupelius>	yes.
<halosghost>	i only looked at it for a short while
<halosghost>	earnestly seems to think it's a decent start at least
<halosghost>	i should take a closer look
<muchoz>	heftig, if i create a 8gib swap and the /home to 50% leaving 50% unallocated space, is that ok?
<muchoz>	both logical
<bougyman>	there's a lot of promises built in to ponylang.
<heftig>	muchoz: how big those two partitions are doesn't really matter, since they're contained in the extended partition
<bougyman>	promiselang
<heftig>	muchoz: so size the extended partition at 50% of remaining space, give 8gb of it to swap and the rest to /home
<halosghost>	bougyman: heh
<earnestly>	bougyman: they fixed the nonblocking issue appropriately, which is a good sign considering how long it took to get it fixed in rust
<earnestly>	halosghost: anyway, it's interesting.  i'd probably just play with e but since this is new, why not.  both cover largely the same concept
<halosghost>	earnestly: fair enough
<earnestly>	pony is different from typical actor models in that it also guarantees the ordering of messages
<halosghost>	earnestly: i'm still spending most of my time on new langs on haskell
<earnestly>	halosghost: except haskell is older than linux :d

<earnestly>	nope
<tazmain>	so c# is open source and the whole .dot net framework is now on git and opensource as well. there was one issue with something and over night someone wrote this large chunk of code to fix it. also the azure platform can now run on linux. c# got some new cool features as well. if you want to see i can send you the video link

<muchoz>	if that's true, then i'm done with partitioning.
<namarrgon>	taurgal: ls /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts/
<earnestly>	jupelius: nah, mono is just another language ecosystem now
<demize>	earnestly: no? the .net core platform is framework + runtime + compiler + asp.net
<tazmain>	demize, but with version 5 the word is that it will be opensource but i can find the framework from a colleague that went to the ms build conference. they got hp laptops running windows 10 as well
<earnestly>	demize: ah, platform.  no idea
<heftig>	muchoz: 82 for swap and 83 for /home
<muchoz>	heftig, yup.
<tazmain>	jupelius, not yet, visual studio is not for linux yet.
<heftig>	muchoz: xfs is nice, too
<muchoz>	meh, let's just stick with ext4 for now.
<tazmain>	demize, halosghost this is that visual studio code that can run on linux https://code.visualstudio.com/
<demize>	"this repo contains llilc, an llvm based compiler for .net core. it includes a set of cross-platform .net code generation tools that enables compilation of msil byte code to llvm supported platforms."
<phrik>	title: visual studio code - code editing. redefined. (at code.visualstudio.com)
<halosghost>	tazmain: vsc != visual studio though
<demize>	tazmain: i.. am quite aware of that. not sure how it's relevant to what i've said?
<muchoz>	heftig, alright. it's written to the disk, how do i make arch linux accept those changes for swap and /home?
<tazmain>	erm okay
<heftig>	muchoz: can you do sfdisk -l again?
<tazmain>	anyways i never thought ms would do this
<demize>	anyway, llilc sounds cool.
<muchoz>	what was the ix command again? i can't source my bashrc because it's gone...
<tazmain>	halosghost, i never said visual studio thing, i forgot the code part :p could not remember what they called it
<halosghost>	mk
<muchoz>	and i just realised i need to do some i3 setup again, fuck
<halosghost>	phrik: give muchoz ptpb
<phrik>	muchoz: `<command> | curl -f c=@- https://ptpb.pw` --or-- `curl -f c=@- https://ptpb.pw < file`
<heftig>	muchoz: there's an ix package you can install
<p1k>	so
<p1k>	is there a single working pdf editor for linux
<p1k>	other than inkscape
<p1k>	wtf
<muchoz>	heftig, https://ptpb.pw/c71b
<halosghost>	p1k: lo draw can do pdfs
<muchoz>	it's /dev/sda btw.
<heftig>	muchoz: /etc/fstab, please
<muchoz>	heftig, https://ptpb.pw/59ry
<p1k>	does it do it about as well as apache openoffice draw?
<p1k>	because that crashes like every other pdf
<linux_dream>	thanks d_garbage indeed, a nightmare :)
<heftig>	muchoz: mkswap -u 66015660-2ef7-4fbc-931c-a1c1f61e38fb /dev/sda5
<heftig>	muchoz: mkfs.ext4 -u 779a45c5-2e25-4617-bfac-16b7f3254604 /dev/sda6
<heftig>	muchoz: then try "swapon -a" and "mount /home"
<muchoz>	heftig, it says it can't open /dev/sda5, no such file or directory
<heftig>	muchoz: run partprobe
<muchoz>	not found
<muchoz>	install?
<d_garbage>	!pkgfile
<phrik>	pkgfile is a tool to find out what package owns a file, even if said package is not installed. pacman -s pkgfile; pkgfile -u
<halosghost>	pkgfile is one of the best tools ever
<heftig>	muchoz: partx -a /dev/sda
<muchoz>	heftig, error adding partitions 1-3, same for 5-6
<heftig>	muchoz: partprobe then; install parted
<kirhp>	announcement from my owner (demize): public service announcement: halosghost’s static typing class begins in #archlinux-classroom in 15 minutes
<muchoz>	alright, i ran it. heftig
<heftig>	muchoz: above mk... commands again
<muchoz>	alright, all 4 commands ran without error.
<heftig>	muchoz: you should see /home/lost+found
<muchoz>	heftig, i see /lost+found, not /home/lost+found
<heftig>	muchoz: didn't you run mount /home?
<muchoz>	yes..
<heftig>	mount | grep home
<muchoz>	nothing
<p1k>	halosghost: how do you actually edit the document? the textbox is grayed out
<halosghost>	p1k: ¯\o/¯
<halosghost>	p1k: i haven't used draw in years
<halosghost>	i know it can though
<heftig>	muchoz: output of blkid?
<p1k>	this is retarded
<p1k>	i've tried 3 different programs and i can't fill in checkboxes in a fucking pdf
<halosghost>	please don't use slurs
<p1k>	which should take literally 30 seconds
<muchoz>	heftig, https://ptpb.pw/lmgs
<p1k>	i will when people stop writing retarded software
<demize>	p1k: really, take it elsewhere if you must use words like that one.
<heftig>	muchoz: try mount /home agin
<muchoz>	heftig, still no /home/lost+found
<p1k>	demize: users shouldn't suffer for hours to do a simple task, this is why linux is unpopular as a desktop system
<heftig>	muchoz: no output, either?
<muchoz>	heftig, nope
<bougyman>	p1k: did you happen to try adobe reader?
<halosghost>	p1k: that's nice
<halosghost>	bougyman: ++++++++
<p1k>	i know i didn't have these problems on windows
<halosghost>	then use windows
<bougyman>	you probably used adobe readon on windows.
<p1k>	autocad worked, photoshop worked, adobe worked
<heftig>	muchoz: so ls -l /home is empty?
<bougyman>	you can use adobe reader on linux and you won't haev this problem, either.
<p1k>	adobepro*
<muchoz>	heftig, yes.
<p1k>	adoberead has shity restrictions
<bougyman>	windows software runs on windows, this is not a surprise.
<p1k>	it's a toss-up
<halosghost>	p1k: why are you here?
<beest>	archlinux-sartre
<heftig>	muchoz: dmesg | tail shows no errors?
<p1k>	cause i have to fill out a pdf and i scrapped my windows partition months ago ?
<sudokode>	wow motorcycle accident on the highway
<halosghost>	beest: lol
<bougyman>	p1k: then install adobe reader and do it, quit your bitchin' about it.
<sudokode>	guy was drinking, trying to pull into a parking lot. bike tried to stop but t-boned him
<bougyman>	if you don't like adobe reader, uninstall it afterwards.
<muchoz>	heftig, nope. shows that it mounted the swap and /home fine.
<sudokode>	arrested the asshole though
<heftig>	muchoz: but it doesn't show up in /proc/mounts?
<beest>	sudokode: biker okay?
<sudokode>	looked responsive but i heard he had trouble with the details of his bike
<sudokode>	so likely a concussion, but he had a helmet on
<p1k>	how come among 5 or 6 competing pdf reader editors they can't make a single working one
<beest>	"there are four headlights"
<d_garbage>	lol
<sudokode>	lol
<sudokode>	no
<beest>	i'll go star trek nerd over here, sorry
<sudokode>	like year
<p1k>	these people should go make webpages or somethings instead
<sudokode>	haha
<muchoz>	heftig, you mean /home doesn't show up in /proc/mounts?
<sudokode>	p1k: do what now
<heftig>	muchoz: yes
<kirhp>	announcement from my owner (demize): public service announcement: halosghost’s static typing class beginning in #archlinux-classroom now.
<beest>	http://a.tgcdn.net/images/products/additional/large/hrus_ex_picards_4_lights_dd.jpg there
<d_garbage>	p1k, if you have a copy of windows, stick it in a vm and use that to get it done
<hongouru>	what flags should a usb stick have to boot a livecd ?
<sudokode>	i don't even know if fillable pdfs are available outside of acrobat/reader
<sudokode>	you can't make them without acrobat
<sudokode>	blame adobe, not linux
<bougyman>	sudokode: they aren't supposed to be, it'r proprietary.
<muchoz>	heftig, cat /proc/mount | grep home returns nothing.
<muchoz>	mounts*
<bougyman>	but the dude wants to complain about software instead of installing acroread, the software which could accomplish his task.
<heftig>	muchoz: really weird
<p1k>	d_garbage: not anymore :s
<sudokode>	p1k: have you tried acroread?
<heftig>	muchoz: grep sda just shows sda1 and sda2?
<muchoz>	heftig, yes
<p1k>	sudokode: i'm getting there, once i get this old pkgbuild to work
<sudokode>	why are you reading /proc/mounts or cat'ing into grep?
<sudokode>	all of this is nonsense
<sudokode>	findmnt /home
<hongouru>	what flags should a usb stick have to boot a livecd ?
<bougyman>	p1k: nothing that's not adobe is supposed to be able to open/edit/process a rights-enabled pdf created in acrobat.
<sudokode>	hongouru: that is a nonsensical question
<d_garbage>	p1k, well if it's just for inside a vm, not connected to the internet perhaps you could 'come across' that copy you 'forgot about' *cough*
<p1k>	it's not like it's hard to overlay text on an pdf page
<heftig>	muchoz: try findfs uuid=779a45c5-2e25-4617-bfac-16b7f3254604
<bougyman>	it's not about that.
<muchoz>	sudokode, still nothing
<sudokode>	mount /home
<bougyman>	you could convert it to an image,w rite on it, then convert it back to a pdf.
<p1k>	but with inkscape you can only opren 1 page at a time, that anothe editor doesn't incorporate that is? err stupid
<bougyman>	but you lose all the pdfness.
<hongouru>	sudokode, why ? i want to run systemrescue from an usb stick, but i am failling to do it right
<bougyman>	p1k: you have to convert it to a multipage tiff first.
<sudokode>	hongouru: there is no such flag for a usb stick to make it bootable
<bougyman>	before using inkscape on it
<hongouru>	no ?
<p1k>	bougyman: and idk what it means "nothing that's not adobe" because i mean how hard is it really..
<sudokode>	it's just like any other block device as long as your board supports booting from usb
<bougyman>	p1k: it's proprietary
<hongouru>	i put the boot flag to true with gparted on the fat32 partition
<muchoz>	heftig, /dev/sda6
<bougyman>	it's not necessisarily hard, rather illegal.
<heftig>	muchoz: mount /dev/sda6 /home
<sudokode>	hongouru: which bootloader?
<hongouru>	good question syslinux or something
<muchoz>	heftig, still no /home/lost+found
<sudokode>	did you run syslinux-install_update -iam /dev/thething
<hongouru>	no
<sudokode>	are you using bios or uefi?
<hongouru>	i run usb-creator
<hongouru>	bios
<sudokode>	oh wait, systemrescue
<hongouru>	yes
<sudokode>	you have an iso?
<hongouru>	yes
<sudokode>	just use dd
<hongouru>	i did
<hongouru>	but it writes shit to the drive
<heftig>	muchoz: mount -v /home
<sudokode>	right, that's how it works
<hongouru>	i tried if=source of=/dev/sde
<muchoz>	heftig, mount: /dev/sda6 mounted on /home
<sudokode>	right
<d_garbage>	dd=writes shit™
<sudokode>	!dd
<phrik>	disk duplicator
<hays>	anyone know a way to disable all systemd logs
<hongouru>	i know is a direct copy
<hongouru>	bit by bit
<heftig>	muchoz: ...and it's still not in the output of "mount"?
<sudokode>	hays: systemctl disable systemd-journald ; systemctl stop systemd-journald
<muchoz>	heftig, nope
<heftig>	muchoz: try rebooting, please
<sudokode>	though if it's a dep for something else, that might not work
<hongouru>	i tried to mount it and view its content and all was fucky (i adopted this term from early here)
<d_garbage>	hays, why do that?
<sudokode>	check /etc/systemd/journald.conf as well
<sudokode>	hongouru: mount what?
<hongouru>	the usb stick
<sudokode>	how
<sudokode>	why
<sudokode>	just don't do that
<d_garbage>	where
<sudokode>	go boot from it
<hongouru>	ok
<shndns>	how do you do?
<sudokode>	livecds are weird
<hongouru>	do i have to delete de stick first?
<d_garbage>	who?
<sudokode>	don't question them
<muchoz>	heftig, there's a /home/lost+found now ;)
<sudokode>	what
<sudokode>	okay i'm leaving
<d_garbage>	why?
<muchoz>	swap is also active!
<hongouru>	my bios is kind of old, but i did it once
<d_garbage>	!twhs
<phrik>	that's what he said!
<hongouru>	sudokode, help!
<d_garbage>	he left
<hongouru>	shall i dd right ?
<hongouru>	d_garbage, then you !
<d_garbage>	sure
<d_garbage>	!give hongouru install
<phrik>	hongouru: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide
<hongouru>	i have the usb stick with a fat32 partition
<hongouru>	shall i delete all that ?
<p1k>	yeah great i'm manually aligning text entries
<hongouru>	or just dd over sde ?
<p1k>	20-fucking-15
<d_garbage>	hongouru, writing the image over-writes whatever is there already
<hongouru>	i thought that
<d_garbage>	hongouru, read the install guide
<hongouru>	but wasn't sure
<hongouru>	i dont want to install arch
<hongouru>	i already have it
<d_garbage>	okaaay?
<macrobat>	:d
<hongouru>	i want to use a systemrescue livecd to resize my fucky disk
<d_garbage>	opensuse do a nice live image
<dacoit>	archiso can do it
<hongouru>	ok ill read that
<d_garbage>	i got a live kde desktop with persistent settings, works a treat
<hongouru>	after dd, should i do the syslinux install thing ?
<muchoz>	heftig, thanks a ton btw. i'm in your debt!
<hongouru>	or not ?
<hongouru>	archiso ?
<hongouru>	didnt know that existed
<hongouru>	but i want just to pass all data from an iso to a usb stick
<d_garbage>	that's what the arch install disk is called
<hongouru>	ok
<hongouru>	thought it was a program
<d_garbage>	it is
<d_garbage>	"archiso is a small set of bash scripts capable of building fully functional arch linux live cd/dvd/usb images. it is the same tool used to generate the official images"
<hongouru>	d_garbage, dd will overwrite everything ? mbr and all ?
<d_garbage>	yup
<hongouru>	d_garbage, and can i use archiso with another iso file like systemrescue ?
<d_garbage>	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/usb_flash_installation_media
<phrik>	title: usb flash installation media - archwiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<octocpp>	what is a quicky command to see what login manager you are using?
<octocpp>	sddm  vs kdm etc
<d_garbage>	hongouru, honestly i have no idea what you're trying to do
<d_garbage>	maybe take a break from it
<hongouru>	d_garbage, haha
<hongouru>	systemrescue is a livecd linux based
<hongouru>	i want to put it in a usb stick and boot from it
<d_garbage>	so follow the instructions that come with it then?
<d_garbage>	seems like a logical approach
<hongouru>	anyways mine is a general question, i need to learn the methologgy of doing this so if tomorrow i want to use another iso i would know what tto do
<hongouru>	i missed the dds bs=4m thats why probably it wasnt able to read correctly from the disk
<dacoit>	octocpp: systemctl status display-manager
<hongouru>	goood guide d_garbage thanks
<dacoit>	octocpp: (guessing here). it should be a symlink to the actual disp. man.
<octocpp>	dacoit: ahh, thanks
<octocpp>	dacoit: was trying that one by one seeing which one is in use lol
<hongouru>	d_garbage, thanks
<dacoit>	octocpp: similarly, you could just poke the symlink itself, `stat /etc/systemd/system/display-manager.service`
<octocpp>	dacoit: ooooh, nice, didnt know about 'stat'  heh
<earnestly>	vod1k: http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2015/5034/pdf/24.pdf hmm
<earnestly>	vod1k: like of like a jvm for everything except only focusing on the important bits they might need like a hardware friendly gc, hardware appropriate architecture and concurrency support
<macrobat>	if i select a sound card in alsamixer, does that mean all sound is going through it or does it just mean i can change the settings for it?
<dacoit>	the latter
<macrobat>	how do i change which sound card is active?
<macrobat>	are they all, simultaneously?
<sudokode>	game of goddamn thrones
<reisio>	oh right, it's sunday
<sudokode>	indeed
<reisio>	macrobat: alsamixer
<reisio>	too early for game of thrones, though
<sudokode>	little over an hour
<sudokode>	71 minutes
<reisio>	how many seconds, though
<reisio>	how many nanoseconds
<sudokode>	but who's counting
<reisio>	nudity ftw
<sudokode>	1 hour, 10 minutes, 30 seconds, 0 nanoseconds
<sudokode>	cause nailed it
<macrobat>	i'm not a throny
<macrobat>	i have no sound atm. i know the pulseaudio pkg was split, but i didn't have that installed anyway.
<scimmia>	macrobat, check everything in alsamixer
<scimmia>	especially anything that's muted
<derpadong>	bet his main sound channel is muted lol
<anadon>	  hey, did something change in the repo's or minecraft to make sound not work?  i haven't changed my settings but minecraft stopped outputting sound.  it appears that either minecraft isn't actually outputting sound or openal is failing silently.
<macrobat>	nothing muted in alsamixer
<derpadong>	i wonder if you have pulseaudio installed.
<macrobat>	there is no pulseaudio, as i stated
<aaronm04>	hi, when i open a downloaded file from firefox or chrome, what configuration controls the app that the file is opened with?
<aaronm04>	or is this a desktop environment-specific thing?
<anadon>	aaronm04: those are per-browser settings set in each's configuration.
<teraflop>	aaronm04: may depends on your de or just xdg the stuff
<aaronm04>	ok, thanks anadon and teraflop
<scimmia>	macrobat, had to check, you wouldn't believe how many times we get people with things muted. if that's not it, we'll probably need more info
<macrobat>	aaronm04: the browser doesn't come in to it
<jeromelanteri>	f
<teraflop>	ouch im going to sleep
<anadon>	macrobat: if the file is opened through the browser downloads, it is decided by the browser.  aaronm04 didn't ask about opening it through the file browser.
<aaronm04>	hmm, maybe the browser can either decide for a file type, and then fallback to xdg-open if it can't decide
<octocpp>	why the heck does my konversation icon look like a blow horn ? lol
<aaronm04>	-either
<muchoz>	success! windows installed besides arch!
<gunndawg>	eww that's a "success"?
<teraflop>	aaronm04: depends on the browser
<teraflop>	anadon*
<jeromelanteri>	someone here know how to do a wrapper script like in this exemple (but with arch) ? exemple: http://vfio.blogspot.com.au/2015_05_01_archive.html
<phrik>	title: vfio tips and tricks: may 2015 (at vfio.blogspot.com.au)
<macrobat>	before recent upgrade, mocp had 3 audio mixers: soft, pcm and master. now there is only soft and master and master can't be raised from 0
<macrobat>	!paste
<phrik>	to paste into the channel use a pastebin: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/common_applications#pastebin_clients
<teraflop>	anadon: ever tried to tell chromium how to deal with mimetypes?
<anadon>	teraflop: i don't use chromium because it doesn't handle tabbing well enough for me, and when i use chrome it is only for netflix.  so, not off hand.
<teraflop>	anadon: you dont need chrome for doing netflix, not anymore
<macrobat>	which piece of sound info is useful? https://bpaste.net/show/4af449720c0c
<phrik>	title: show at bpaste (at bpaste.net)
<jeromelanteri>	i arrived to have windows vm guest on qemu/kvm with nvidia graphic card pci passtrhough, but i try to call the guest from virtual-manager (i can not). then this tuto i paste is old and i don't know how to wrap x-vga=on to command from virtual-manager.

<linux_dream>	i don't understand what you mean braindamage about the http part
<hwkiller>	svenstaro: oh, i see. sorry. i think my card was tagged on the unsupported list for that
<escondida>	linux_dream: try sprunge.us, not http://sprunge.us
<al2o3-cr>	linux_dream: just press ctrl + alt + u let go then type 0027
<svenstaro>	gaivsivlivs: because i just pushed it and had to compile it with a newer compiler than usual
<linux_dream>	ok thanks escondida
<coolthingy500>	my card is no longer supported. i can only use the free drivers.
<linux_dream>	al2o3-cr, i tried that and it enters 0027 as i type it
<gaivsivlivs>	i wish the free driver had full modesetting for my 750
<braindamage>	linux_dream: you added http:// which isn't present in the command suggestion, the // would require escaping in a shell, and it's likely the source of your problem
<linux_dream>	same error escondida
<escondida>	braindamage: // doesn't require escaping
<al2o3-cr>	linux_dream: did you press enter after 0027?
<linux_dream>	no
<al2o3-cr>	linux_dream: you have to press enter too :)
<linux_dream>	-bash 0027: command not found
<escondida>	linux_dream: incidentally, i'd *highly* recommend learning to use tmux. you could save yourself a lot of trouble by just copying the character you need \-:
<linux_dream>	problem is that i don't see the ' anywhere escondida
<escondida>	(and tmux is handy in general)
<escondida>	...it's right there
<linux_dream>	how would i copy it
<escondida>	you just typed it!
<linux_dream>	well that's not on my laptop where i want to install arch
<escondida>	ah

<earnestly>	“ and ” won't work, sure
<coolthingy500>	pacman saves my hair from debian package manager. god knows why that package manager still around.
<linux_dream>	 i should take a photo and upload i guess
<earnestly>	linux_dream: which keyboard and layout?
<braindamage>	linux_dream: escape the character, also, you can switch keyboard layout
<linux_dream>	my hardware is laptop hp pavilion something, default arch layout
<earnestly>	there is no "default arch layout"
<escondida>	coolthingy500: because people are loathe to throw out two decades of work by hundreds of people and thousands of packages?
<pyonium>	earnestly: legacy options?
<earnestly>	linux_dream: which layout are you using?
<linux_dream>	hmm en local 8 or something like that.  uefi
<escondida>	linux_dream: again, try escaping the <
<earnestly>	linux_dream: what.
<earnestly>	linux_dream: what keyboard layout are you using?
<linux_dream>	i don't remember out of memory
<braindamage>	escape the char, then take a pic of the keyboard, i'm curious
<earnestly>	uefi and locale don't really matter, it's keyboard layout, keymap, etc.
<escondida>	linux_dream: the < is almost certainly what's causing it to balk, because it's a special character for your shell.
<coolthingy500>	i can see that being the case. escondida
<linux_dream>	i didn't use < escondida
<escondida>	!give linux_dream sprunge
<phrik>	linux_dream: pipe or redirect your command or file into `curl -f 'sprunge=<-' sprunge.us`. this will upload to sprunge.us and return a link to the paste.
<jza>	hi i got some conflicts when updating dhcpd-6.9.0.1
<escondida>	linux_dream: ↑ the < in that command line. escape it.
<svenstaro>	so anyone like gonna test nvidia?
<escondida>	please.
<jza>	got the following erorrs:
<jza>	https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8833879
<phrik>	title: mozilla pastebin - collaborative debugging tool (at pastebin.mozilla.org)
<linux_dream>	oh i see escondida
<earnestly>	linux_dream: setxkbmap -print # or localectl for vc keymap
<al2o3-cr>	linux_dream: like this: echo yay | curl -f sprunge=\<- http://sprunge.us
<jza>	how can i update the packages manually (all except dhcpd)
<linux_dream>	same error escondida
<earnestly>	!give jza exists
<phrik>	jza: to solve «filename exists in filesystem» errors, read this: http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=56373
<escondida>	linux_dream: then replace everything after the pipe with `curl -f c=@- https://ptpb.pw'
<phrik>	title: pb (at ptpb.pw)
<earnestly>	wow.
<linux_dream>	earnestly, system locale: n/a, uc keymap: n/a, x11 layout: n/a
<earnestly>	linux_dream: something is wrong
<earnestly>	linux_dream: are you on the tty?
<linux_dream>	yes as root
<braindamage>	‏‎what ‽
<linux_dream>	it's the only way i can get into arch right now
<dacoit_>	lol
<aeiro>	hey, i'm trying to get an external monitor working on my w530 with a quadro k1000m and i haven't found anything that works with bumblebee + nvidia proprietary drivers
<linux_dream>	i haven't finished to fix my grub problem
<aeiro>	i'd like to not lose powersaving, if possible
<earnestly>	linux_dream: right... what does printenv lang produce?
<linux_dream>	c
<earnestly>	linux_dream: hm, is english your main language?
<linux_dream>	system language yes
<jza>	phrik: well i got a no package owns /usr/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-hooks/01-test
<linux_dream>	i didn't change anything, it's taken out of the arch.iso
<earnestly>	linux_dream: no, your language
<earnestly>	linux_dream: that language that you speak
<gehidore>	+1
<earnestly>	i just think they're struggling with the wiki because it's not in their native language
<earnestly>	"i didn't change anything" is precisely what you're not supposed to do
<d_garbage>	i know, i know but it would be funny
<d_garbage>	a tour de force
<diegoviola>	some of us speak more than one language, and english is not always our primary language
<d_garbage>	like in a after week or so more of this they went, "hah! got you, suckers!" :p
<escondida>	diegoviola: it's not a judgment, it's trying to understand what exactly is causing their repeated misunderstandings.
<slurpymcdurpy>	. . . i doubt it.
<gehidore>	diegoviola: so we need to write "rtfm" in more languages?
<gehidore>	:d
<diegoviola>	yeah i didn't thought it were, just saying
<diegoviola>	gehidore: man pages are already localized, afaik
<earnestly>	escondida: fwiw, you can use @- in sprunge as well, see curl(1) for the difference between <- and @-
<braindamage>	gehidore: it becomes a problem then when the manual isn't localized tough
<linux_dream>	earnestly, , french spanish and medium english
<lyonsb>	trolls tend to prefer low-hanging fruit.
<escondida>	earnestly: good to know, though i've become a staunch ptpb fan (-:
<lyonsb>	the #archlinux channel is not low-hanging fruit.
<earnestly>	linux_dream: have you considered asking in #archlinux-fr?  then you can speak more comfortably
<linux_dream>	lol a troll? i spent time from 7pm to 2am the first day i bought my hardware, the second day i spent 3 hours on arch and today a few minutes so far but i've got stuff to do
<d_garbage>	sure, no worries
<escondida>	linux_dream: i'm willing to bet d_garbage was joking.
<linux_dream>	no i haen't earnestly , but i've considered the arch forums.  the problem is, i can't reproduce the commands the guy wants me to do
<linux_dream>	because of the apostrophe
<linux_dream>	ok
<earnestly>	linux_dream: the french layout does have ", on '3'
<swalladge>	hey what's the way to make a window manager masquerade as another (ie. awesome wm telling applications that its kde plasma)?
<dacoit_>	hmm, easy?
<earnestly>	linux_dream: since it is most likely an azerty
<jza>	how can i update individual files in arch?
<d_garbage>	swalladge, why?
<jza>	instead of just doing sudo pacman -syu
<d_garbage>	!give jza partial
<phrik>	jza: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman#partial_upgrades_are_unsupported
<linux_dream>	i am in argentina earnestly , but i have ' and " keys the problem is that they appear curved on the screen and the commands don't work so i assume that they aren't the real apostrophes
<linux_dream>	it's a qwerty
<soleblaze>	swalladge: wmname might work
<swalladge>	d_garbage, i want to force chromium to use kdialog, rather than the default gtk one
<earnestly>	linux_dream: they're probably not "curved", that's just the default tty console font
<earnestly>	linux_dream: either way, you could use @- instead of <- for mostly the same result, except @ doesn't need any special handling
<braindamage>	linux_dream: does your keyboard look like this? http://www.goodtyping.com/teclatlat.htm
<phrik>	title: latin america - keyboard layout (at www.goodtyping.com)
<earnestly>	linux_dream: the curl(1) manual documents what -f accepts
<linux_dream>	similar yes
<linux_dream>	but the @ sign is on the q key
