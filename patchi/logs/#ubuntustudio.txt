[14:28] <kyle123> Hey has anyone got liquidsoap working with libav for stremaing to twitch/livestream?
[17:05] <delt> Hello
[17:06] <delt> just a quick question, how do i setup my jack session so that i can run stuff as another user with sound?
[17:06] <delt> (using my main user's jack session)
[17:09] <delt> my other account is part of the 'audio' group, but i still get just silence :(
[17:12] <delt> i'd prefer to use the main user's jack connection, but for the mean time i'd just like my piano program to work.... i really don't want to do the registration stuff for another user (pianoteq has only 3 "activation"/registration slots, and i don't want to waste my last one)
[18:41] <delt> SOLVED, thanks to the very kind folks in #linux ... now everything works perfectly!
