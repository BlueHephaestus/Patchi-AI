<darkelement>	i might take you up on that kind offer, however right now in order to run it on your machine you would need a certain file path and structure, however i am going to change that soon and make it work better on others machines

<darkelement>	it's not that smart yet
<darkelement>	need more stuffs
<darkelement2>	what the hell happened

<darkelement2>	what are you
<johnbobsmith>	darkelement2: looks like your bot crashed.
<darkelement2>	my bot...is darkelement and patchi now...
<darkelement2>	wha...

<johnbobsmith>	why does it take so long?
<darkelement2>	as i was saying, it's not that smart yet
<darkelement2>	the way it connects does this, idk
<darkelement2>	perhaps since we are both using irc on the same machine at the same time

<johnbobsmith>	how are you?
<patchi>	are you paranoid that i know your brother?
<patchi>	i have better things to worry about
