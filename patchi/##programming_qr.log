pyon: sounds like a generalized "what's the best data structure for ordered data?" question - and i know you've already talked about what you dislike about b-trees :p	i've already picked a data structure. what i want is (some help) to sort out the messy details of the bulk insertion process.
a small bit of dedicated swap is very good to have.  it really is useful on linux where daemons load but do nothing until an event occurs - why keep them occupying precious ramspace?	linux can swap them out and use that memory sp for hard drive caching.

what's a good windows software that does uml modelling? i just need some basic tools for like classes with properties, attributes and arrows between them	hi!
twey: anyway, i agree that subtyping is overkill for most use cases. so that's a good argument that it should be avoided whenever there's a simpler alternative. but i'm not sure it's completely evil. perhaps we haven't mastered subtyping simply because we don't understand topoi well enough from a type-theoretic pov?	i think it's more valid to say that most foundational type theories we have explicitly reject subtyping
some of the memory allocated to your process and/or its children will be shared with unrelated processes on the system. how many times should it count?	on linux your big options are (a) run the process using cgroups and read the memory accounting fe for the cgroup; (b) walk /proc/<pid>/maps (virtual memory usage only; requires lots of accounting).

sefia: why should any of us speak to you then? you've basically just said that you dont give a flying fuck about communicating with us	it's always context-dependant; i think saying it doesn't matter is a little simplistic... and your self-censorship is somewhat ironic too

but trolling stack exchange? what's to be gained from that?	do you happen to know that from personal experience? -d
programming research. sure you could have text as the base storage form, but there are some negatives like your ide having to work with text input. you also have to work with files, instead of just 1 file for the entire project. why would you want files if you already have namespaces?	oldornew you are definty not making sense and smalltalk and lisp did this in the 1980s.
aewffwea: i'm actually trying to learn how dynamic language users think... i want to find answers to question like "what reasoning principles do they use for their programs?", "how complex does a program have to get before they say: ah, my brain alone isn't sufficient, i need tests"	there's untyped lambda calculus and typed lambda calculi

what is teh first column?	mysql_query *is* an error.
i came with a question though of course.  i have a matrix that is too large to fit in memory, one option is to use a distributed matrix class on top of a cluster... but then we still have to have an obscene total amount of memory.  so what i'm wondering is, are there any distributed matrix implementations that can easily be made to work on a single machine with a distributed database, e.g. hadoop?  our matrices are not sparse.  we can of course rewrite o	you were cut off at 'rewrite ou[...]'

why do people obsess about feet?	why shouldn't they?
why did they make #php invite only? to keep the noobs out or something?	functions are a special type of subroutines since functions 'return' a value.
man mount says about "--bind": "the same  contents  is  accessible  in  two places".  well, how is that different than what a symbolic link does?	it works acrosss mount namespaces (not sure if symlink does or not)
thj: how big are the schema's you have worked with?	i see a pattern or grasp a concept. i can talk to you about foreign keys one-to-one one-to-many many-to-many but i didn't know about that term you used.
gedamo: wait.. what kinds of human beings deals with such things?	why does that guy maintain a list of instructions when intel does it already?
pyon, who let a breaking change like that through? isn't that a lesson to be learned from c++; that everyone loves backward compatibility?	iirc the upgrade from ghc 6.x to 7.0 broke a lot of code.
dreams: if you took what people say about declarative languages literally, you'd be like "yay, i don't have to learn to code?"	ihatehex the funny thing is that i'm possibly better than ever or in a long time yet i'm retired and have all the time to hack  hang with friends get stoned etc. p
ams: and go on, what is the point of having that?	that was the point.
wei2912: how do you know? it is random.	have you seen american fuzzy lop? that seems like a really cool way to do fuzzing

tnght: how about no? buy it.	not the place for that
if you mean "why 'if-else' and not something else?", if-else is compact and straightforward	can't that be said about everything?
i sit here and listen to these people talk about very abstract and weird stuff. they really do sit there and just blabber on and on about the "cloud" and all these weird terms. i really wonder what that *means*. how exactly is it different from me running my cronjob-executed cli scripts on my server? i don't understand what all these companies need to run and why they need to move it around in "the cloud" and all this stuff.	'the cloud' is more a marketing term

nitrix: then what do you mean by objects in c?	i don't mind windows. i mean it isn't as fun as linux or even os x but i'm not paid to have fun. but vb6 the language is super annoying. it's fundamentally hostile to any code reuse mechanism besides copy-and-paste.
ams: i'm not making any sense because you are too short sighted. sure i'm not perfect at explaining this, but you're still saying what i'm talking about is like what smalltalk did? i don't know about you, but i can see smalltalk projects on github...indicating that they use ascii/text files as the base storage format...	fun fact i've been wokring in such an environment since 20 years.
another one: what will happen if two threads of the same priority have been called to run simultaneously?       chose  "it is dependent on the operating system"	i think that it wl do one then the other or allocate for both or switch between them quickly

aawe: where did you here that?	designer friend
pyon: why fix something if you can have a thing that half-works?	i hadn't heard of the terms "covariant" and "contravariant" when i was 15 but i could've perfectly explained why java's arrays are "wrong". (now i know the term is "unsound" of course.)

pyon: why do you consider standard ml moduels "by no means" object-oriented?  it seems to me closer to a limited form of it.	because standard ml modules are second-class entities. you can't for example create a module that contains this or that code depending on some user input.
toccatanfugue: okay, what's the issue?	the original hastebin - http//hastebin.com/vixahusaso.cpp printing some_array[0][0] prints 11 and some_array[0][1] prints 22

maybe algorithm is more of an abstract description of what needs to be done, whereas a program is a concrete implementation of said abstraction description?	yeah
what seems to be wrong?	what are you doing? pastebin some code so we have a chance at letting you know how to fix it
thj: what did you call something like email -> username, age before you came to know about functional dependencies?	i see.
guys, will i have more time after finish my study, when i will go to a job?	merijn my brain says it wl probably crash
so if you had to implement a circle with rings as a data structure, how would you do it? it should have o(1) access to a given ring from the origin and it should have the capability to remove any element. also, the elements on the rings aren't guaranteed to be comparable. everything is only comparable to the origin. what is also true is that elements in outer rings "may" be able to compare to elements on rings closer to the circle. for any given e	what exactly do you intend to store for each circle?
what theme though? ^^	lol

_blizzy_: so what constitutes full stack, in your opinion?	i mean like aawe was right but it's not just only php
anyway---why would storing your code as an ast be beneficial?	ask chuck ..
gedamo, why does that guy maintain a list of instructions when intel does it already?	are you still writing in stack based languages? must be easy to transition to assembly

why do you think it would be slow?	changing a function name and having the ide do lexical analysis and parsing on all files that could possibly be using that function so that it could rename them would be slow. and you're still not understanding me. the programmer shouldn't be the one doing manual formatting inserting new lines when the line is too long etc because the formatting would be destroyed as soon as you change something like a function name.
where should i ask for help with vb script?	in a place where there are people who know the answer to your question and possibly are well versed in vb script to be able to figure it out.

what exactly do you mean by "fit on top of"?	good question. it's for a 3d printer http//www.3ders.org/images/type-a-machines-next-generation-3d-printer-2.jpg --- so i want to compare the "design file size" with the "bed size" then figure out if it fits. if it doesn't i need to find a delta (scaling factor)

do you understand what im trying to achieve now?	it sounds like you need to hire somebody
what part of double* floatarray = malloc(sizeof(double)*187000*1900) wouldn't do what he's asking for? replacing "double" with his system's 32-bit floating-point and assuming he has enough memory in the first place.	well im doing a 5gb file now but i may end up doing a 30gb file in the future so then this wouldnt work
what language?	c/c++ or whatever. obviously not java ecmascript or python.

merijn: even with a highly expressive type system, i doubt you can convince everyone that it is sufficient and that tests aren't necessary. testing is also done on a module and functional level. why wouldn't those be relevant?	the stuff that's easy to reason about should be in the core language and the hard stuff should be in libraries... but for some reason c++ does the exact opposite
magellan: hm? so you mean that the leaked versions of googles nda where you are not allowed to talk about anything are just made up thingies meant to hurt google?	no i completely believe they have ndas

what are your thoughts on that flexibility that java is providing?	hotr have you actually done this?
dogpolice: what's this got to do with the anti-piracy measures?	i'm not either but do you think you get anti-piracy measures without actually writing to the cart?

songarchaeology: sure -- if it's the case that gender diversity leads to a more productive business environment, why not schooling?	except that teachers dont really have control in the way necessary for it to make a difference. they're basically following rubrics ridiculously strictly because they dont have other options. diversity creates a better working environment because you're talking about people who are working together and who have a variety of experiences to draw upon. creativity and teamwork are hugely affected.

ams: what's a search function exactly?	fawefeawfewa binary se on a sorted array

merijn: and you think more people knowing how to program would result in less people actually programming?	perhaps because they'd fully appreciate how hard it is and why we shouldn't treat programmers as a replaceable commodity? is this your line of reasoning?
anj7: what if you're on a laptop, do you get more power then?	yea if i had laptop i would charge it before the power goes off.

felisha what have you made with the raspberry pi??	the ftdi doesn't run any code itself; the code is executed on the computer it's plugged into instead. an arduino actually runs code itself but in many sensor applications all this code does is read data and send it to your host computer anyway.
how do you learn things?	oh in any order.
what is the best gl lib to use ? :)	there is an opengl channel on here

exio4: what would those be? i'd go search it myself, but i don	yes. any type with fmap and associated rules is a functor. with pure and ap and it's an applicative. with join is a monad
why won't you love me, txdv?	because you're a shit.
puddlejumper: does calculus really help much when designing algorithms? (besides numerical algorithms.)	i started off self taught doing html/js back in the 90s when i was in 7th grade learned c a bit on my own when i went to college learned c/c++/java leaving school did flex/as3 development for the gov for a few years and now back to js/html since it works on mobile devices gotta use the tool for the job at hand doesn't make you a better or worse programmer because of using a particular language or platform

aidanh: how could they?	songaeology correcting just about right to achieve fair hiring practices or just about right to achieve a faster resolution of the "gender gap" than would occur in the case of the former?
wei2912: is there a new supercomputer? how did they solve tic-tac-toe?	not in tic-tac-toe it isn't
what the hell?	yes but that's for a recognizer.
ams: how do you?	right so the best language in your opinion is the language that can do that most often?
ra4king: what's your question?	i don't remember what your original goal was. convert to a number? if anything you could identify the unicode code point for a specific character.
what's the project?	er...i just have to get the data from search engines using rapidminer api
ams: do you know what could be causing it? (indent-to <tabstop>) works as expected, but (indent-region) refuses to do anything	i'm going to study the n log n version after. i just want to make sure i fully understand how i could do it this way
camcam2: that's fine, what sort of projects did you do?	oh.

tejasmanohar: one codebase, two servers running it with different configurations.  i don't see what's complicated?	yeah nvm that's not complicated
znoosey: can i have the datasheet at least?	we all know what you would do with them so no
ams: the examples in the hyperspec sometimes use concepts that are only explained later on. is there any reference where the examples only use concepts introduced up to the current point in the document?	because you know i can't define a in terms of b if i don't know what b is. i'd need to define b first.
xgc: why?	just interested.  it's a very long shot.
hello. my website is periodically infected by trojanjs/redirector. what may be the cause ? old apache ? (my php files dont use user input so i dont know how its exploited)	it could be an exploit in php too.

i want to write a parser. how do i approach the task?	sit infront of computer open editor a write code test if it works return else goto  a.
side note, when people describe something as "first-class", what precisely is that meant to mean?	a name is a variable name like 'x' or 'counter'. that name is 'bound' to a specific place. normally you can figure out what place a name is bound to by looking at the code. a name can refer to a number of places such as a variable defined in a loop in c# which creates a new place on each iteration
ams: how can you have code that works accross multiple instances of monad without monads?	monads aren't a language construct they're just an abstraction. they can appear anywhere
if i want to implement comparator for an object, can i write it as an inner class? or does it need to be a separate file/class?	if the program just one single fe then i would just use global all over the place ..

darkcthulhu: preincrement where?	same place where you did the postincrement. i did "string first = *++it;"
amigojapan, cjz: do you guys remember dearhawk in here yesterday talking about making randomized programs to generate factoring algorithms?  it doesn't matter how fast computers are, there was no way for him to succeed because of simple o notation analysis of the problem size.	generatin factoring algorithms is not what a usual job needs you to do anyway

denommus`: what theorem provers specifically?	can i prove say the monad laws work for a given monad instance?
stumbles: what if i take your source code and reindent it? yes, it's derived work.	that's making a derivative work. which is an exclusive right of the copyright holder.
deerhawk: why not?	but if you've sent him the pictures already it's too late /. you'll have to do it.
pyon, i see why you said 1,2,3. what if we computed the difference between the elements in our tuple and 1,2,3. would that give us the answer?	some clue perhaps. not the final answer necessarily.
why not 'stuff && things'?	thanks for being a sounding board
it would be like dict["stumbles: redefine what?":["yeah but python also clearly doesnt care about performance"]]	ah so you have « redefine what? ["yeah but python also clearly doesn't care about performance."]» as your input?

_blizzy_: why?	-ktiert because it's stupid
merijn: how would that even be done? wouldn't that require compromising on making lambda abstractions... well... abstract? [as in, the only way to making observations about a lambda abstraction being applying it to different values.]	any closure that contains only serialisable objects is serialisable
myrl-chan: you think what?	in classical logic yes.
what's next, an organization for men who are under 150cm? "short men have been opressed for centuries, shorter men on average make x% less than men over 150cm.."	a physical notepad can be very convenient.

can someone give me some tips on this dynammic programming problem: how would i create an algorithm that takes an array of numbers one-by-one combines adjacent elements via +/-/* to return the maximum value possible (combinations can be in any order)? so for example [-2,-1,1] would be 4 (-1-1=-2, then -2*-2=4).	it’s going to involve going through your values recursively checking to see if an operation has been done on those values if so retrieve them from an array if not do it and store them in the array then search the array for the max value
why would that be easier than making an ai/sentient computer, you think?	we do it all the time!
why would that be evil?	gedamo seriously though has google actually done anything interesting that is new? i cannot think of anything ...  they have something like 20k engineers ... and stl all they do is "search engine" which is totally unexciting research mostly solved afaik
lf94: what is blaot in emacs?	everything that is not involved in editoring or adds to the joke "emacs is a great os"
merijn: wasn't there a study that showed that type related errors didn't cover too many of those encountered in practice? i doubt it takes away the need for tests.	"whether the resulting code is still worth running i don't know and i don't want to know either" -- i think the readme.md said something like that
dexx1_, yes, what was the wrong result?	dex_ you will need to use (printer_max - tolerance)
pyon, why do they have constraints on numbers like that?	dunno perhaps to keep the problems small?
aawe: didn't you tell me why having >1 buckets is good, not having buckets of size >1 is good?	i meant >1size buckets

so i've been playing with json on jsfiddle , and i was able to pull the data i was looking for from an api, and i'm ready to start fleshing things out to actually do something with that data. but when i try to make a local copy, it starts giving me crap about the same origin policy. i know what the sop is and why it exists, but why does it work fine on jsfiddle but not in my  local copy?	the compiler is allowed to work around that.
pyon: why are you poor?	the art of the metaobject protocol is at least a great book for cl oo people

ukrainianalek: hello, the only think what i've found is -> launch updater with admin right. it is correct ?	either you run the script with elevated permissions (==admin rights) yourself or if you know your way around the winapi (i don't) you do that in the code. either way you need to get past user account control (and that's not really a programming issue) and get the user to confirm first

joe128: why not?	my experience in ##c++ is that it's less hostile than either ##c or ##java. but it probably has more to do with the fact that i know c++ better than either c and java - and thus ask less stupid questions.
nestharus: file formats are data structures. how about using jpeg to represent it?	think of a general tree data structure man with levels. if you are on level 2 that is 2 away from the root of the tree.

uberlambda: shurg, why not?	just a matter of writing a compiler.
but what about the highly samen culture?	oh yep finnish mythologies )
myrl-chan: how do you handle that? i kept a year's worth and my table looks like it has been bombed	that is not hoarding that is university life

you have no clue what you qre typing huh?	no you can not you will get sued by apple
grill_u: why aren't you using latex?	_u libre open microsoft
neither does c, what's your point?	casue you are not producing a program image.
what kind of programming? why are you even interested in it in the first place?	and .. you don't have to be bothered with java stack trs that are unreadable. )
pyon: well, the general principle when designing structures like this is to add on constraints that you can find ways to quickly enforce; perhaps something like "when creating new nodes, all the new nodes and the modified node must differ in size by at most 1"?	ah thanks!
darkcthulhu, sounds cool! what are you hoping to do afterwards?	i'm headed for an internship this summer. after graduation probably work a couple of years and then head out for a phd.
hi i'm actually a little bit confused. at the moment im a cs student and want to be a good programmer. i also thought about programming games (just as hobby) which also could improve my programming skills. so actually my question is if you guys would recommend me using a framework like xna or monogame where i have to code more from scratch or rather use a engine like unity?	what do you think you'd enjoy more?

how about a beaglepi?	we may need a factory to build like optimus'[n]  <--- doesn't know the syntax at all
in java, what is a reason why an undirected graph should throw an unsupportedexception from its gettopologicalorder method? if the graph in question contains a cycle, right? since a topological order can't be created in that case	that is not really surprising but is it a reboot?

jkbbwr: what use is a snippet of written knowledge?	because unlike code you can use writing in many different domains without any specific requirements
numb3rz: no. many programmers suggest python as a first language, and the python documentation as introductory material. what don't you get?	wow ok i'm trying to grab the concept of modules keywordsetc. and logical lines??
and what meta data?	changing a function name and having the ide do lexical analysis and parsing on all files that could possibly be using that function so that it could rename them would be slow. and you're still not understanding me. the programmer shouldn't be the one doing manual formatting inserting new lines when the line is too long etc because the formatting would be destroyed as soon as you change something like a function name.
why do we need to cast to char * ?	because otherwise you'll always get "1"
orakar: what do you like doing?	css?
oh hey, how is your hair? the last time, your head was mostly bald	who are you talking to?

farrioth: ok i've read up a little on the ftdi and im wondering really what's the difference from arduino and raspberry pi they all can connect to sensors rfids and so forth would it be the code that makes it accurate?	yeah true
can you explain what these variables are there for?	sure. printer_d = diameter of circular printer bed printer_z = vertical z-axis size of circular printer bed design_d = diameter of the design file design_z = vertical z-axis size of design file d_delta = the difference between the diameter of the printer and design file z_delta = the difference between the vertical z-axis of the printer and vertical z-axis of the design file d_scale = the scaling factor for the di

i guess im not familliar enough with the format, how are the three bytes supposed to be interpreted. sequential with the first byte most significant?	planckwalk gave good cues as well. i'd try collecting as much info as you can; unicode is consistent in general but it has a lot of legacy when it comes to encoding.
what about on plan9?	ok i really mean what is the algorithm for doing this with the best asymptotic running time.
what do you think that is missing out there in the world? :d	vdamewood imo for its time and the hardware avaabkle it was waaay too verbose and expensive computationally...once hardware caught up nobody really wanted it any more...moular programming was already kinda normal

encapsulation: so whats the comment above that error say?	perfect.  now you're completely new to c and running your tests as root.
xgc: what do you mean?	halp all data in computers you use is binary.
anyone know what a cavalier system is?	how does it fail

pyon: why would that be desirable?	because it means that i can read the definition linearly
pyon: can i prove, say, the monad laws work for a given monad instance?	i have no idea i never used them
how can efficienty checking if 2 sets are equal be done in a purely functional style? in imperative style, i would keep a 'changed' variable and set it to true whenever a new item is added to a set. checking if 2 sets are equal requires o(n) time whereas the imperative way requires time as much as the find_item() and add_item() operations require, which are usually o(1), o(lg n), etc.	compare their elements?
nikio_: why work so hard? and this approach doesn't scale.	you can do separate echo >> statements.
dogpolice: what do you mean?	i mean that they wanted to probably save that space for the code to verify the integrity of the game for actual game features.
wikked: do you want to understand the core of how things work, or do you want to maximize the impact of your resume?	what do you call a good programmer?
is it because when i use an interface it's weaker as i have to write my own method code, whereas extend is strong since the code in the method is already wrote in another class?	sounds a too pie-in-the-sky question.
fiki: what do you want your work to be?	making high level software so not like programming a chip
then what other orientations are there?	hotr modular programming
pokeymantrainer: well, valid in what sense?	it's implementation defined what exactly that means.
what does for(;;) {  } do in java?	infinite loop.
rfreeman_w: and? what about every single propietery license?	the gpl does no such thing.
ams: really? i use the mouse very little except when gaming, which is rather seldom as well	pi- i hope you have a really high sensitivity setting on your e. you should be able to move the pointer across the screen with a tiny movement

aawe: what is it?	an incredibly clever fractal editor
quarterback: how do you test if the program runs for 50 years, without... actually running it for 50 years? (since you don't want to prove that it does)	i think you missed the "100% sure" part.
_w_: what are you doing on my cloud?	this is a communal cloud perhaps you confused it with ##?

how did you know ? : )	that's not good. -).
denommus: what, you can only bind one name in each let?  o.@	i get the impression that in practice advanced static type systems (especially those with subtyping!) have a tendency to develop periodic tables. and only the combination of type theory and taste in design [neither in isolation will do] can prevent this.
nikio_: why not use hexchat?	xchat is unmaintained. hexchat is its more maintained fork.
encapsulation: what and how much did you pull?	couldn't you pick the most permissive license to encompass the whole project?
what can i do in python to make a 2d array always available to be expanded? i.e. i want to set [1][2] to something it will let me	you want to be able to set arbitrary values?

xeno_ i’m not sure what you mean by a dynamic vs static language. do you mean like js vs html?	almost all languages today are strongly typed i.e. they have a type and generaly produce errors based on that in some form.  where with a weakly typed language i.e. forth you really don't know what might occur.
adsc: where can i change the ip ?	why is the internal ip changing?
why do people use the word "fuck" to convey a negative emotional response?	no idea
sloshy, and x is what, the number units?	you could put do-while loop at the top of your for loop that chooses a position and loop while the position choosen is not valid.

jeaye: what kind of reference? position in the vert vector?	i don't see your face.
_blizzy_: what makes you think that's java?	it is java
do you guys believe i was not aware about the differences between html/css and programming languages when i asked the question?	i didn't care enough to put effort into making a decision.
yeah. and there's also the issue that not all types are meaningfully serializable. (e.g., how does one serialize an impure function?)	a related issue is that file access is fairly inherent "cross process" which a lot of languages handle poorly in the first place.
how will urllib2 be able to help?	https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_of_youtube_downloaders   here
